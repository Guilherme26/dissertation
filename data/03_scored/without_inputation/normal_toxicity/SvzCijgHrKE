Charlie Chaplin just had such a way of telling a story and his message in this movie buck up never say die we'll get along I the whole thing that quote resonates today and I really wanted to watch this movie since I haven't washed it in really long time but also because I'm struggling to find a job on currently as of this filming,0.11344294

my parents can't help me,0.09588085
they're in a tough situation the whole thing just kind of sucks now and the world is very much mirroring that time in the 30s and modern times and Charlie Chaplin actually made this as a commentary that machines are replacing man in the workforce and machines in industry are causing issues,0.44038686
no,0.06626663
so same thing you hear that all the time that machines are taking over people's jobs,0.08461261
and you know everybody's gettin laid off in certain places and factories and all that it's just the way of the world and his commentary comes through as well this was like the last silent movie to ever be made as we made as i said in 1936 silence had all but disappeared and this was also the tramps like goodbye the characters could buy and the only things that make sound come from technology like in the factory,0.16767381
you have the factory owner the boss he comes in on like these big television screens and he tells somebody dead section number 5 make it go faster and hear from the radio and certain other things and that I think that's just a very very interesting commentary on Charlie Chaplin's part because you know it's the same thing today again technologies just taking over I'm talking to you right,0.17075883
