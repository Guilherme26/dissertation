alfred hitchcock films rear window is not only technically fantastic,0.47055027
but its story and construction are incredibly clever as well in his famous interview with hitchcock director francois truffaut perfectly sets out the brilliance of the stories we get in the flat jimmy stewart looks out at and how his relationship with grace kelly's character plays into it you get the whole relationship spectrum the young newlyweds miss lonely hearts who can never find the right man,0.15052731

alfred,0.043466944
hitchcock films are the ones where he takes the audience with him and actually places them directly into the action and rear window is a brilliant example of this james stewart is like an audience member observing the apartments across from him but he is also a director making choices on who he looks at,0.1560054
and when hitchcock said about this film's construction that it is all about human responses and reaction what i also like about the film is that james stewart's character is also just a passenger,0.10677023
we're not really experiencing the story through james stewart's eyes there's a few moments where the audience actually gets more information than he does for example when james stewart is asleep,0.07971979

hitchcock is not only controlling the characters we see but he's manipulating us,0.44458988
