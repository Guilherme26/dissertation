seeing as Star Wars is a huge franchise and has been since the late 70s I decided this is not going to be a typical review and more of a spoilery discussion I mean let's be honest it's Star Wars you already made up your mind whether or not you're going to see this so yeah if you don't want any spoilers I suggest you wait until after you watch the movie before you watch this review if that doesn't bother you then let's jump right in you hey that movie chick here and today I'm reviewing Star Wars Episode eight the last Jedi my parents were fairly big fans of Star Wars so it was something I definitely was exposed to heavily as a child my thoughts I only really rewatched him her Strikes Back and the terrible Ewok spin-offs yeah I was that weird kid I don't think I can ever fully explain how far back or how deep my love for bad 80s films goes I sure the sentiment was my mom of course is she's the one who had the Ewok movies recorded on VHS there's nothing wrong with the new Hofer even to a lesser extent returned the Jedi stars just wasn't something that shaped my childhood the way it did for others so yeah fast forward to 10-year old me when the first prequel the Phantom Menace premiered I hated it well most of it I love the costumes duel the faith scene was pretty legit it introduced me to you McGregor in Le Portman who I am big fans of even to this day I ended up liking Attack of the Clones more only because the cringy love scenes are marginally more tolerable to me than the boring politic scenes from Phantom Menace I'll take a bad CW twin show over boring session of c-span any day also you can't go wrong with you McGregor at a beard one of my first big celebrity crushes in high school Revenge of the Sith was the best out of three only because your expectations are lowered so much anything is better at this point honestly the first act is fun the third act has an amazing fight sequence and some great emotional punches mostly from you McGregor and Natalie Portman gets the best line in the entire prequel trilogy [Applause] thunderous applause I just wish George Lucas would have relinquished control just a bit and let someone more competent at least help write the dialogue in the story with him and apparently my prayers were answered when he did just that he signed over his cash cow to Disney and in 2015 we were given the force awakens I thoroughly enjoyed it it had a great cast some badass scenes jokes hit and I'll give it a pass for all the nostalgic callbacks and basic copy and pasting from a new hope because I understand why JJ Abrams had to prove to everyone that not only could he bring Star Wars back but engage both new and old fans though I will admit I was initially happy to hear someone else taking over for the next installment we need fresh ideas and for someone to breathe life into this franchise JJ irbaz isn't a terrible director per se but South Park wasn't really exaggerating when they say he only uses member berries the new Star Wars was not as good as everyone thought it was it may seem fun to go back and recycle the past we loved but we end up with no sustenance I thought you're gonna explain why people want a guy like me to be President well that's important too I guess but it's just a symptom of the same thing he makes movies at a pier nostalgia and more often than not forgets to shake things up and try something new so the last Jedi was handed over to Rian Johnson director of brick a film I liked and looper a film were Joseph gordon-levitt's prosthetics gave me nightmares so how does the last Jedi fair then the last Jedi has a fun first act in a thrilling third act the fight scenes from the last movie are amped up to 11 here there was an especially cool fight scene between kylo Ren and Rey against the Praetorian Red Guards I felt he even rivaled the badass Vader fight from rogue one yeah it was that kind of awesome there are some really gorgeous shots in this film especially in the third act when they're fighting on the salt planet I would say the mo just emotionally gripping scene for me was all done by an on character I wasn't expecting it and then realizing it was clearly a setup for the new character Rose but I'll take it kylo Ren has only gotten even more engaging and cooler to me here I don't care what anyone says he was one of the best parts and force awakens and that's no different here in fact the better dramatic moments all belong to him in his interactions with Rey Mark Hamill's return was much more improved than that of Harrison Ford who walked around with the face of a man who was only there for a paycheck he puts his all into his performance and doesn't hold back it felt like he never left which gave me a fuzzy feeling the lovely Carrie Fisher is here in her last film role and she couldn't have picked a better one to go out on Oscar Isaac gets more to do and show off his talents as more than just a simple charming ace pilot also bb-8 manages to remain just as adorable and hilarious as he was in the first movie alright you ready because I need to address what I didn't like about this movie there were so many [ __ ] cutesy creatures in this film for anyone who complained about baby Groot or the Ewoks you will die from the cuteness overload in this movie at first from the trailers I thought I was just going to endure like maybe one or two scenes of those puffins which basically looked like what happens when you squeeze your cat's face but they don't leave they overtake many scenes with Ray and Luke on luck I'm sorry this island clearly looks like they stopped filming the Highlander just so they could film a Star Wars scene here and even when I thought I had escaped those little cat penguins they just get replaced immediately with [ __ ] icicle foxes and yes while the icicle foxes did have more bearing to the plot was it really necessary to crowd every scene with them Russell's a gross aliens wears the ugly-ass Tontons that sound like dying camels I'm really not exaggerating here it gets to a point where the main story is hijacked by a subplot including big fluffy creatures that are being mistreated which speaking of the main plot as is was good enough and could fill a whole run time why the need to bak it down you got lay on the rebels fighting to survive and escape from the clutches from the first order while ray goes to seek help from the last remaining Jedi Luke Skywalker thrilling stuff right but then late gets put out of commission and one of the strangest scenes I've ever had to sit through in a Star Wars movie and that's saying something so in comes Laura Dern with very purple hair it felt less alien and more like watching a woman going through a midlife crisis Paul and Finn decide they don't like Laura Dern are her plan so then a new annoying character rose set off to find the codebreaker only to get sidetracked when they stumble onto the movie set of okhta and tried to rescue some animals instead like I get it movie I get that you wanted to show both sides of the coin that there's good and evil on both sides except you never go far enough with that concept more on that later so yeah then gets fuck-all to do in this movie his characterization comes to a screeching halt and his subplot goes nowhere and is ultimately pointless in the end this movie doesn't even allow him to engage in his many fight scenes and comedy bits which is something he excelled in the force awakens he is completely wasted here and his new sidekick slash shoehorned in love interest Rose is just bland her said it was interesting and why she decided to help the heroes made sense but she mostly speaks in made-up sci-fi jargon about technology I don't know or care about so she's basically a Star Trek character without the charm she's just very preaching and consistent meanwhile as all this [ __ ] is happening raised bucking around on a planet switching between her back-and-forth with Luke or kylo Ren it is nowhere near riveting as the training subplot and Empire but damn if los daddy doesn't try its darndest she basically just trains herself and learns nothing new on the island from Luke they basically have the same conversation over and over again the second act is the worst section of this movie it drags its feet and clunk Lee goes through every storyline without being able to balance any of it out there is so much that could have been cut down I hadn't felt the length of a Star Wars movie since Phantom Menace but you know who should have gotten more screen time instead Wendelin [ __ ] Christie have you guys learned nothing from force awakens you don't hire brand of ptarth and not user she's clearly here as a substitute for Boba Fett and she could have been a great one if they actually put her in the movie she has even less screen time than Fett how was it even possible she gets two scenes accompanied by a lazy Disney death she would have been an appropriate subplot in catalyst for Finn as a means for him to overcome his stormtrooper past and his insecurities about who he needs to become there was no need to kill her off so soon what a waste of a great actress I don't know the scripts to blame or the new director both but yet the acting in this is not very stellar here the actors were struggling the jokes they they just went flying man apart from bb-8 little skits I found myself sighing or cringing away from the screen there is a scene where Luke Skywalker drinks gross green alien milk from a strange creatures utters it will never leave my brain and I'm pretty sure it will haunt my dreams for the rest of my life though Mr Cable does manage to breathe some life into these lines the director seems to be working against him on it when you're first introduced to him rave returns his lightsaber just like at the end of the force awakens and Mark Hamill with a straight face Chuck's the laser sword off a cliff I actually started chuckle until I realized the music and Daisy Ridley were playing this off so seriously it squashed the joke before could ever actually take off and that's just the tip of the iceberg in this film there is no balance or proper placing of the jokes in juxtaposition to the more dramatic scenes of this film seems that should be tenser sad or interrupted by crappy one-liners or lame gags being crammed in like after Poland the rebels barely survived an attack from the first order then wakes up leaking this weird fluid everywhere from his plastic bubble suit seriously movie you just made me watch all these casualties and you stop it all for a lame sight gag I understand films need levity but not to the point that it disrupts the pivotal moments I won't be putting the entire blame on the last Jedi as it's a pattern of notice with many movies of today I was quite fond of Daisy Ridley's performance in force awakens all the complaints of her being a Mary Sue I thought were unfounded as she was no different than that of Luke from a new hope she was a pretty good role model for young girls and she was successful in both the light-hearted moments as well as the more darker and emotional scenes I was definitely excited to see how they would further her character development in the next installment and does she a short answer she doesn't not really the long answer I had the same problem here that I did with her performance in the Murder on the Orient Express Daisy Ridley is young and is still paving her way in acting she has still yet to convince me of really showcasing a darker side of herself I did not buy for one second that she could be so easily swayed by evil she's to doe-eyed and her version of anger is screaming like mice little sister when she was five years old it's not always her fault she was jealous some really bad dialog like when she's first taught to feel the force they use really heavy-handed metaphors like her dialogue is way too on-the-nose she has to say things like I feel death in life and light and dark the dark side is even symbolized by a literal dark giant hole in the ground when I said I really enjoyed her scenes with kylo Ren it wasn't really because of Daisy Ridley it was because of Adam driver he carries their scenes and I'm sorry he just has the better more complex performance let me put it this way Daisy really is not so much like Sarah Michelle Gellar's Buffy but more like Kirstie Swanson's Buffy then we'll be completely cops out on giving her a more intriguing and darker storyline the movie constantly hints and teases that she might turn to the dark side in that they'll pull switcheroo and kylo Ren will turn to the light however it's almost as if a Disney executive saw this and when wait we won't be able to sell toys to young impressionable little girls of Rey turns evil cut that out doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense as long as it's predictable that killed the momentum of this character rape for me she truly transformed into a Mary Sue here and it really made me sad to admit that I said I gave force awakens a pass for all its nostalgic winks and nods but the last Jedi is at its weakest when it's copying the other films most evidently and purr strikes back it tries to recapture the battle scene on Hoth the training sequences from Endor however they should have learned from JJ Abrams as past mistakes with Star Trek and that you need to leave classics well enough alone there are a handful of pandering scenes that actually do work here r2d2 is the one who convinces Luke to help the rebels by showing him an old hologram of Princess Leia back from a new hope and when Luke decides to destroy the old Jedi Temple on the not Highlander island Yodas ghost shows up to give them some sagely advice and it actually works however most of the time it just feels like they're copying pasting what worked from impressed it's back and even force awakens and just writing off their coattails in the end it came off more like a hot mess similar to return the Jedi than anything else there are so many character arcs and storylines that are either dropped entirely or rendered completely moot Benicio del Toro please the Code Breaker that Benin Rose had to find not only does the storyline drag I mean it felt like an eternity in that [ __ ] casino but when he actually gets her into helping them he immediately be traced them in the next scene so yeah that plan meant nothing to really rub it in your face Pope finds out Lauren actually had her a brilliant plan on how to save the rebels by using cloak transports to get to a salt planet which of course ends up [ __ ] up because of their [ __ ] of having the codebreaker who led to a betrayal of knowing where the transports were good job heroes roses Ark makes no sense either her sister the non character with the cool motional scene she sacrifices herself to save the rebels which in turn moves rose to become a better rebel hero except in the end she stupidly stops Finn from sacrificing himself in order to stop a first-order weapon from killing all the rebels because she loves him now I guess and yeah they tried to shoehorn in that she learned some lesson that I've learned not to kill what I hate but save what I love except you know she's pretty much doomed to all the rebels if it wasn't for Luke luckily just sauntering in disable other asses they would have all been dead she didn't know that he was on his way there to help so she basically acted out of selfish desire and did not really learn from her sister sacrifice ray on the not Highlander planet learns nothing come look his lessons are basically just chastising her and telling her about how the Jedi faith is good and dead he's a failure and she's too easily seduced by the dark side up apparently they never shown me this but they do like telling me a lot oh and that he doesn't believe in the force anymore or something it brought me back to one favorite TV shows penny dreadful Marceau - my favorite episode in season 2 Ava Graham portrays Vanessa a young woman with mysterious powers who was constantly fighting being seduced by the literal devil because if she does the world will end and humanity will be doomed desperate and afraid she seeks the teachings of the cut wife Joan Clayton who was more than resistant to helping her in fact she makes her stand outside in the cold rain for three days before deeming her worthy it's a great episode with some brief moments of levity brilliant gut punches of drama as we follow the Nessa being taught not only how to utilize her powers but is heavily warned to never use her darkness or it will swallow her up and you believe it too now I realize that this is an r-rated TV show that has more time to develop its characters but it managed to pull this off in one episode with this entire movie never could all these plot lines go absolutely nowhere except for kylo ren's watching his descent into madness is not only fascinating but it was at times heart-wrenching early on he gets a chance to kill his own mother and he doesn't take it he hesitates and the wastes no belittle him for having conflict in his heart and still carrying feelings for those from his past till the point that kylo just straight up de sizeable I guess I gotta cut everyone out of my life and by cut them out I mean literally to ribbons and when you finally get his backstory with Luke you really feel the emotion and less sorrow between those two I wish Mark Hamill and Adam driver had more scenes together as they were both the sole saving graces of this movie Adam trigger also had some pretty decent chemistry with Daisy Ridley and I wish they had further developed that instead of just copping out and just placing the black hat on him and the white hat on her it's truly heartbreaking that Carrie Fisher has left us as a person she was someone to be admired someone who survived and never allowed herself to become a victim and always stayed true to herself and said what she thought and her arc in this movie they had more than enough chances to end it on a high note instead they have this unintentionally uncomfortable scene where she gets blown out into space and we see her floating around is what we assume is her corpse and then out of nowhere she magically flies like Superman into a surviving ship and has a short-term coma as a result they temporarily replace her with laura dern who ultimately sacrifices herself and the most badass usage of CG in this movie she uses Lightspeed to slice through the enemy fleet it was awesome it made me think of only hindsight or in 2020 and instead of laura dern they used carrie fisher for this ultimate sacrifice instead no instead the classic character they decide to kill off this time is luke kind of reminded me of the Dark Knight and they're on fortunate switcheroo so yeah Luke astral projects himself does some badass stuff then acts out one of his popular early scenes from New Hope and vanishes into the force the rebel base is saved by him and Rey everyone celebrates kylo Ren has now taken over the first order and the movie just kind of ends on a Rando kid we met briefly and to show that he has Jedi powers the end the ending didn't quite have as much of a punch as Empire Strikes Back did or even attack of the clones for that matter I don't have any pressing questions the same way I did after the force awakens now that I've watched it go a very predictable route they I mean they already gave up Rey's parents as scumbags who sold her off for drug money or something which would have been an interesting thing to bring up in the movie that she has no place here but they just kind of say it and move on so another wasted element in this movie meanwhile kylo has really turned to the dark side Rey is pretty much taken Luke's place and with that little kid at the end it's heavily imply that we're going to see more people who are one with the force and that clearly the Jedi are not indeed extinct there were no real loose ends here not any that I actually cared about anyway all in all this film could have been a great one it had so many good ideas and interesting themes with grey morality but the execution is beyond amateurish the dialogue is too on-the-nose and void of real human quality no balance between the humor and drama the whole movie was a jerky roller coaster ride that didn't know how to properly build up two scenes or characters so do I hate this movie no what I watch it again when it's available in streaming sites I'll give it a go and just watch my favorite parts and that's the most frustrating element about this movie when it's good it's [ __ ] amazing but when it's bad it's god-awful and just cringe II this is a rentable movie for me at best I really hope they get their [ __ ] together and end this new trilogy on a high note well that's my review I hope you enjoyed it if you did please subscribe to my
