there that's 8th grade the movie there's a little bit okay so because I know,0.15968649
you've all been waiting for it this is my review of a crate so I,0.15446831
I know a lot now uh people been asking for this review but there's a,0.073921375
few interesting reasons why I thought well first of all I apologize because this is,0.07092373
one I did have a screener for like I could have saw I could have,0.08246988
seen it early but uh there's two reasons why not well one is that I,0.06719658
I think I was working that day or something like that but then the other,0.06737374
thing was you know I saw the trailer for this movie and I said you,0.108758636
know this looks good it kind of looks like I feel like I know what,0.07426735
this movie's gonna be though and we'll kind of get to that in a bit,0.153136
it's one of the reasons why I'm doing this review so this is very much,0.08122724
truth in advertising uh this is definitely a movie about eighth grade or rather the,0.09282948
last week of eighth grade I should say but but it's very much that that,0.074963
age of being around eighth grade and a lot of people's enjoyment of this movie,0.14534628
is going to come from how they enjoyed eighth grade and my guess is there's,0.11026274
uh there's three people they're gonna have a certain there's three main responses that I,0.06635831
think three people three responses that this film is going to get what its gonna,0.0891495
be people that see it is just it was the point of that nothing happened,0.07774328
screw it which I get there's not many twists and turns or anything like that,0.39781561
in the movie by I mean watching the trailer I think you could figure out,0.07617523
that that's not the kind of movie it is there's others that's gonna see it,0.08572052
for kind of the awkward strange confused but very important time in you know a,0.113197304
child's life that will very much impact them as they become adults very much about,0.19506326
closing one door and opening another and they will say man this really connects with,0.06547599
me like this is so honest so truthful and this just really really holds a,0.077931695
deep place in my heart and then there's the third kind which a lot of,0.083004996
people have told me they don't want to see this movie for this very same,0.13458852
reason which is that they've gone through eighth grade and it wasn't fun that age,0.119957194
is an awkward age and it's uncomfortable and it's not something that a lot of,0.13637014
people want to relive I'm kind of one of those people and that's the reason,0.098493494
I kind of wasn't interested in seeing this movie because I said I'm sure this,0.08714465
is done well but I don't look it's specifically that Graem that's like the exact,0.0670763
grade I really don't like because we moved around a lot when I was a,0.09450645
kid because my dad was in the Navy and so like he kind of it,0.18958177
kind depended where we were if I fit in well or I didn't fit in,0.079339124
well if I was popular I was not popular and 8th grade was just like,0.07290518
just when we moved to a new place it from a place that we've loved,0.062470693
and we moved to a new place that we did love and we just have,0.05328575
we were all kind of miserable there we just we did not fit in or,0.50589406
at least I didn't fit in to the new school I was given to so,0.07603858
given to but then when high school started and you know things got better I,0.06233079
got to know people better and stuff like that but eighth grade was not a,0.07883255
happy time for me and this is a movie that is not it's not like,0.0716476
a miserable movie or anything it's not like welcome to the dollhouse but it is,0.37421763
a movie that definitely very well taps into the insecurities of that age and if,0.08125607
I'm guessing correctly again I'm not an eighth grader but it seems like it's connecting,0.113980144
it very well to like today's technology to the way kids talk now which I,0.06085052
don't think it's too different from you know like when I was growing up but,0.07537993
the but definitely the technological angle and the social media and and the putting videos,0.08247919
online and stuff like that and finding kind of different outlets for what you're going,0.110242136
through so I knew a lot of people I have a lot of friends they,0.07562519
were saying like well I don't want to see that movie cuz I hated eighth,0.24057592
grade I've knowed a lot of people that that said that so and they weren't,0.12857519
interested but I had this one friend who was telling me over and over you,0.09115134
gotta see this movie and on top of that Rotten Tomatoes was just praising the,0.3310982
hell out of him even had this thing this is why you should ignore the,0.42964607
are rating on eighth grade and I know if they're talking about I mean it's,0.10123858
like it's it's are for a good reason I mean don't get me wrong but,0.09172932
I mean it's like I can't remember they say that many swear words and there's,0.0686617
a see if they do talk about like sexual stuff you know easy freighters talking,0.55581474
about sexual stuff I think there's even a scene where like a woman's holding like,0.69695693
a dildo or something like that you're like yeah if an instruction no so so,0.7753023
this is very much this is very much kind of letting people out there who,0.11737043
aren't abating whether or not to see this movie like trying to help them figure,0.0816116
out what kind of movie this is you know is this something they would like,0.09607443
if some people say it's very depressing other people will say is very inspiring a,0.18884844
lot of people say it's both and my opinion is both but it's it's kind,0.089443415
of exactly what I thought it was gonna be so if you're looking at this,0.08622996
trailer and you're saying man that looks like a lot of uncomfortable awkwardness you know,0.24085641
and sort of like kids that you know are trying to figure things out but,0.120881625
talk like they had things figure down they're gonna embarrass themselves but it's also part,0.27739885
of growing up and they're not gonna be liked by a lot of other kids,0.17822415
or they're gonna be ignored but then they're also gonna be liked by a couple,0.1426113
other kids and they have a sweet moment with like you know me the parents,0.09360744
and stuff it's that kind of movie but it's not done like I don't know,0.09656128
like American Beauty or something where there's like clearly a three-act structure where this thing,0.14181437
that happened the beginning is gonna happen at the end there's a lot of things,0.07428829
that technically don't go anywhere there's a lot of stuff where like she'll meet a,0.10272883
new character and have a very unique scene with that character and then just you,0.08438655
never see that character again there's kind of stuff like that and and it's good,0.06455294
that's like that cuz a lot of a lot of film is very much building,0.06968191
up this very current you know time and place and personality and who you are,0.15368542
there's even like a weird thing where she like puts away a memory box like,0.24005832
from sixth grade and they opened in eighth grade it's like what is that something,0.09366345
that like only two years but but that's something a lot of it is you,0.098571956
know sort of like it's taking these steps and Serve going into you know the,0.079587236
next step you know it's it because you're going through tough stuff doesn't mean you,0.08320574
give up on it there's a lot of good things and yes a lot of,0.056937855
it I related to you know I think because we have moved around a lot,0.061755486
there's a lot of times where you know I I was kind of everything I,0.0698532
was the popular kid I was the total loser I you know ashamed to say,0.66332686
I made fun of kids but I was also made fun of at you know,0.1774522
some points it's one of those things where it's like depending on where I was,0.03941208
and how well I fit in you know that they were different experiences but that's,0.06308364
also part of growing up so I think it's also one of those things where,0.04226429
if you look at this I like let's say you say it's greats the best,0.1084247
time of your life let's just say you were the school jock you know we're,0.26133126
a sports team and you did awesome everybody loved you and stuff you still gotta,0.08224374
have something awkward like everybody goes through something awkward I think everybody can find something,0.17525616
in this that they can relate to in terms of like that confusion or even,0.027487967
if you were super successful you know at that age you may think I got,0.08923131
everything figured out and and of course you don't but but a lot of people,0.14973903
have a age you know I think they do have a lot of stuff figured,0.062602945
out or more things than they're aware of and this movie very cleverly ties that,0.09367598
in with her kind of video v logs that maybe two or three people watch,0.09758812
I mean nobody even watches them but she puts him out there to kind of,0.28418687
figure her own stuff out very clearly and one of the things I like most,0.11042728
is that the editing in this is very good is if she's invite to this,0.08134466
party that this girl has ever already made very clear does not want her at,0.40321228
the party is only inviting her because I think I think it's her mother because,0.1677217
she's like what's your name again it's kind of weird but um but but she,0.29733893
forces her to invited to this party and she does a v-log saying like you,0.12065273
know I I was having this party and my dad want me to invite this,0.0938025
friend and I didn't want to but I did anyway and you know when I,0.06875183
met up with her though I found out she was actually really nice and really,0.083156236
kind and I'm glad that you know he made me invite that person over so,0.115750894
she's clearly changing things too you know almost play it out how she wants it,0.089098975
to happen in her mind and they're playing this video while she's walking up to,0.15081297
the door of the party which is very clever because again it really taps into,0.10245174
kind of what the mindset is at that age where you're kind of playing in,0.13242202
what will happen what you want to happen you know hopefully making it what you,0.10340213
think will happen and you know if that's kind of what's going through your mind,0.18391803
and me very much taps into like you know this person that has kind of,0.15485373
social anxiety and she's not I like it because the the kid does not seem,0.19280991
like your stereotypical geek you know in a lot of these movies like the geeks,0.5123409
are making fun of super super all the time and it's just really you know,0.06871117
just constant and this kid just seems like a normal shy kid who wants an,0.24998476
identity and she's still trying to figure out her identity and the videos are kind,0.17740692
of her hobby in figuring it out but it's also not like it's clearly a,0.12786436
journal even though the videos are set up to like give advice and I also,0.04067337
like that there's kind of little victories in this like her going up and singing,0.15438606
karaoke at the party which you never hear her sing which again is very clever,0.21179987
uh is a victory to her to a point where it doesn't matter how she,0.19233395
sounds and nobody boos nobody rolls their eyes and obey or anything like that she,0.2888331
sings and that's it and a lot of the time the movie the reactions of,0.0647015
the other characters it's not as much about that as much as her reaction how,0.07522681
she feels about it there's this scene near the end where she finally tells off,0.1513712
I guess not really a bully but she very much you know let somebody know,0.37164536
how she feels about something she does the whole thing without looking up at them,0.17347316
I mean I get very clever and we don't see how the kids really react,0.19148122
we see a little bit while she's talking but when she walks away she just,0.17315984
gets this little smile and it's like it's it's not she told the person off,0.20370656
in a really great way it was super odd and awkward and uncomfortable but she,0.25274035
was proud of it so it's it very much sort of hits those little victories,0.18222481
and I will say it does not end on again kind of like welcome to,0.083933175
the dollhouse a park Imperial a lot so that it doesn't really end on a,0.08547103
note like that you know when I operate it back to that again when I,0.07879709
first saw welcome to the dollhouse which s where this is now review of uh,0.0773698
I didn't really get I didn't see the point of it I'm like okay we're,0.054480344
just seeing a person get made fun of for a couple hours why is that,0.10573248
interesting why is that fun or anything and when I got a little older I,0.10494993
appreciate it a little bit more but it's still not really my thing I have,0.15443659
an appreciation for it but I don't really like it but I get why other,0.08505236
people enjoy it and I do get the comedy of it too and I admire,0.1895662
the harshness of it but with this film I feel like it's it's not quite,0.09269769
doing that it's just combining enough a new stuff with having this kid can be,0.19246952
someone that can disappear but it's not like you know what the hell's that drew,0.5525507
Barrymore comedy was it never been kissed or whatever where it's like in high school,0.17080778
I just disappeared and nobody noticed me yet nobody noticed Drew Barrymore weird no it's,0.15061413
not like you know just kind of a typical teen comedy I mean it's done,0.28325933
with a lot of heart and a lot of thought and watching this even though,0.049653936
hobbies I grew up a boy I'm watching this I'm saying okay well I recognize,0.109773606
that feeling I recognize that moment I recognize but something like that happened but I,0.056815576
also recognize the nice moments too so very much the reason I want to do,0.06097875
this review is anyone that's like if you see this movie and your thing it's,0.18112387
either gonna be all a downer or it's gonna be super sappy about and uplifting,0.12832408
and stuff uh it's something kind of in-between and ultimately ends on a positive note,0.07569454
but it is I'll even say half and half I'll say 70% of doubt or,0.04984598
70% a anxious uncomfortable awkward you know that's probably better way of putting it because,0.103692435
I mean there there's a lot of movies about childhood are much more aggressive and,0.14197092
this is not an aggressive movie this is very much focusing on sort of the,0.087310195
awkward stuff that can happen and how it can impact a person without necessarily having,0.14442293
to spell it out to you it can just sort of show what they're going,0.14901018
through when she goes to this party for example you know she she has this,0.0956609
one-piece suit and nobody else there is wearing a one-piece and it's something where it's,0.15465592
like she never says that she never mentions it but but you notice it it's,0.11139833
like oh well like all the other girls are wearing like bikinis and stuff like,0.43299973
that and she you know does not have you know the body's like what they,0.2324258
have in stuff is a clearly a different friend group but then like when they're,0.07069695
taking the picture you know taking the picture of all the girls together and they're,0.17824017
all game together and they say oh we can't see you you know main character,0.106471516
we can't see you come to the front and you're thinking like well Kay they're,0.10819961
gonna do the thing where everyone rolls their eyes or they push her off and,0.33288145
they play some sort of mean trick and then she turns into Kari and zaps,0.25544637
everybody no but you know what I mean like does some sir a mean trick,0.172302
and they don't I mean they just let her be a part of the picture,0.11389837
okay whatever they they don't really like her but you know it's they're trying to,0.118457995
be more realistic like that's what people would do they just love being the picture,0.104886554
and be like whatever you know and that's kind of the feel it's like most,0.05529913
of it feels very legit very realistic there's one or two moments where they don't,0.0472316
sometimes the father does something like after he drops her off in them all he,0.27195084
does something that I thought was very odd and kind of out of character even,0.08265973
for him you know there there's another weird scene where like this this boy is,0.1990397
driving this girl home and I mean you can see it's coming a mile away,0.33872536
but he obviously tries to hit on her and tries to get with her and,0.15055759
the way he does it even for eighth grade actually think it's 8th grade I,0.10555824
think it's like ninth grade this kid is very odd and I don't know that,0.24149723
felt very like the way was done when it was very very strange but you,0.1489123
know it didn't seem like yeah that's that age like now that's just weird um,0.12614301
but you know once in a while they'll do a shtick that's like oh it's,0.23964293
that stick way like I've seen this in a comedy but it feels mostly pretty,0.18059933
genuine and when somebody actually does want to hang out with her or she actually,0.25969046
does get a friend that's really cool and she's super anxious and she practices how,0.09113018
to say hello and stuff you feel good that she actually like is connecting with,0.12247174
someone and then you feel just as bad when you know something really uncomfortable happens,0.15515466
and again a lot of it is kind of done through the performance and done,0.03812944
through you know just the various ways that they show what this person is going,0.10064175
through you know visually so yeah I guess what I'm trying to get across is,0.05924735
that this is a very genuine movie it feels very much like eighth grade and,0.0719686
even if you were super popular in eighth grade like everyone can find something in,0.15557274
this movie they can be like yeah I went through that yeah that's something I,0.1013786
can relate to but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll get into the movie you either,0.029117145
say you want more twists and turns or a more traditional story or you'll say,0.077160984
that this is a little too real and I just that's not something I'm interested,0.06880454
in seeing for me I'm glad I saw it uh I don't know if I'd,0.113507695
see it again for all the people that were saying like yes this just a,0.07185305
movie that shows the genuine awkwardness of eighth grade yeah this and it does it,0.08406497
well but it isn't 100% downer it does bring up some positive things as and,0.03293808
you know genuine joyous stuff but like I said it's 70% awkward uncomfortable you know,0.11222948
stuff that maybe you'll really connect with um I think it's no reason really one,0.11266413
to talk about because it is a movie where I feel like there'll be a,0.053150643
lot of people there just like this is not the movie for me and I,0.102156535
I would kind of be in that category I just be like I remember eighth,0.0423583
grade fine hey you know I don't need I'm not someone that likes to go,0.2104746
back and watch all home movies of myself or anything like that I don't like,0.10587313
remembering how awkward I was and I acknowledge it I know I was but it's,0.1719057
one of those things where I'm just like I don't like reliving it um but,0.062908955
a movie like this very much can sort of take that feeling it can say,0.08462898
it's okay to you know everyone went through this you know everyone went through sort,0.12342412
of these different stages of awkwardness at that age you know that's really that age,0.083637886
and for some people maybe they forgot about it and this kind of brings it,0.05622597
back and it's very much about moving forward and you know again there are some,0.035777535
clever things even though I don't know why it was two years that that time,0.12238983
capsule memory box or whatever you know it's very much about that happen now you,0.1444142
know moving forward to the next step and they they do that in a very,0.07813031
clever way so this movie is a shot very clever it's edited very clever that,0.24027634
the sound design as well with where they put the audio of like her videos,0.119770795
explaining stuff and what she says and why and and so forth is really good,0.06874464
when she's upset when they have it go quiet you know maybe you have her,0.101726905
talk or just certain songs or whatever I mean it's stuff that you definitely recognize,0.10924257
and I'm glad it doesn't take place in the 80s or the 90s I mean,0.10504781
don't get me wrong I when something like that comes out it's like cool that's,0.15287474
when I grew up but it's really everywhere right now and I think if you're,0.048405103
gonna do something with that it's fine people want to do something with that but,0.06331452
they really have to have more to it you know just a coming-of-age story in,0.0751928
the blank decade it is getting a little old like you really really have to,0.2873817
put a different spin on it which I think people can do and are doing,0.06808245
but we're seeing a lot of kind of just ooh references the 80s the 90s,0.031706
or whatever so I'm hoping that people kind of wake up more that there has,0.08754647
to be more to it than that and there is a lot to this and,0.05502612
like I said the fact that it's set now and it does address technology and,0.053407647
sort of the different hobbies that people have I mean people are on there they're,0.10305094
on their phones a lot you know in this and they're on their laptops and,0.056482356
everything you know I feel like it's there's gonna be a large peep a large,0.09540129
amount of people that really do connect with this movie and so I kind of,0.15305765
wanna make that clear to that is this is a very very good movie it's,0.09423211
a very very well-done movie and if you're looking at this and you say I,0.1079882
really want to relive what eighth grade is like or experience what eighth grade was,0.092957236
like this gets several elements even it's not exactly your childhood it gets several strong,0.15653689
elements of it but there are going to be people that just don't have an,0.07370418
interest in that I'm a me for me the stuff I like to I know,0.106714204
what's ironic the guy that plays in this now a critic but the stuff I,0.105385266
like to relive is you know things like movies and shows maybe see a toy,0.12266278
I grew up with or something like that or a place or an environment I,0.06904431
like seeing that because that sort of brings back a lot of emotions and a,0.06339375
lot of feelings that I connected to those certain objects when they actually bring up,0.17576449
the actual emotions and and topics and stuff like that you know that's where I'm,0.059904274
like because it's I don't know it's just strange as some people have different things,0.09869169
they connect to you know when they bring up like the exact emotions I like,0.056653876
