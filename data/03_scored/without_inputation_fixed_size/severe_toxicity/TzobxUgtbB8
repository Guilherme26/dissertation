all right so I just got out of the quiet place or a quiet place,0.054325547
sorry a quiet place and before I get into anything any kind of specifics obviously,0.05790224
as per usual beginning of the review no real spoilers and then I'll be very,0.019404737
clear when I say that there's going to be some form of spoiler but before,0.023961246
I get into it I just want to say go see this movie like this,0.07666308
is the best movie I've seen in ages possibly in in like years like obviously,0.03140465
those movies that have come out that are like that I love that are like,0.057231735
Marvel movies or just like you know fun movies and stuff like this and stuff,0.1725819
like that but this movie has hit me harder than and then any movie in,0.09318957
a really long time for being kind of like a horror movie it hit me,0.16034584
in the same kind of way that something like The Green Mile would hit you,0.122343235
in terms of like an emotional scale but also an addendum to that if you,0.036466032
don't do well with tension at all like if you're somebody who really can't handle,0.11573198
any kind of tension hi rocket maybe don't go see this movie or at least,0.07165824
wait until it's like you can watch it at home and kind of separate yourself,0.053584535
from the moment obviously when you're in a theater it's very hard to to exit,0.04748214
to pull yourself out of a situation to do something to kind of remove yourself,0.4944967
from like negative feeling emotion he knows my face is red I'm gonna get into,0.12604499
that this was like my job it was just either way it was it was,0.021470133
very very very good so for those of you who don't know a quiet place,0.106652886
is a movie that was directed by John Krasinski and if that name sounds familiar,0.0230699
it's because he played Jim in the office yeah that's right Jim from the office,0.019692762
is now making really really serious movies and well some of you might be like,0.047544666
isn't it isn't it just a horror movie isn't it just like a run-of-the-mill kind,0.050539322
of horror movie it is so much more than that this movie managed to build,0.053940408
tension and character development in like such an absolutely amazing way that you're like right,0.04602206
from the get-go you care about all the characters you care about their well-being and,0.0319062
it just it just continues that tension bill just the entire time it's I honestly,0.038868677
can't think of a movie that did it in a better way the last time,0.030601773
I saw a horror movie that kind of had that level of tension and intensity,0.079933785
it would have been it follows but this goes so far beyond that in such,0.021708934
a beautifully amazing way which is kind of interesting to save for the stuff movie,0.03142261
is if you guys saw the trailers just to give you a basic rundown you,0.034613498
just you get the idea that something has happened to humanity we're kind of a,0.03091574
little bit into the future probably not too distantly in the future well yeah I,0.058070533
know for a fact it's not too distantly in the future but some things happen,0.024999596
and basically humanity's in a state where you you can't make any noise if you,0.11040652
make noise things attack you and obviously the movie goes through oh it doesn't go,0.2266991
too far into detail doesn't it doesn't do one of those like de0 type things,0.032794885
and build it into what led to where they are now really it picks up,0.04328483
about like 89 days into whatever this disaster is it tells you right like it,0.044502117
actually says it right on the screen it pretty much picks up 89 days into,0.023149056
probably what I would presume would be the first incident or whatever happens and it,0.03697623
doesn't it doesn't pander it it doesn't go over it for too long you basically,0.0340574
just rocket you basically just see kind of like posters like oh like newspaper articles,0.024786074
lying around that kind of tell you with a brief idea of what happened but,0.07459569
then basically it's just John Krasinski and his family are trying to survive through this,0.029204888
ordeal and John Krasinski specifically describes it as being for his kids and I was,0.02865212
when I heard him say that in an interview I was like this is kind,0.051418696
of looks like a pretty scary horror moving its horas kids but I guess the,0.124601535
idea is is that it's supposed to show exactly how far he or you know,0.01827459
a father or a mother would go to protect their children to go to protect,0.06680107
their family so it was just kind of like an ode to them and honestly,0.052746404
when you see it you'll you'll be like wow that's that's really spot-on so it's,0.027758779
it's very it's very simple in nature when comparing it to something like annihilation just,0.26150036
because similar undertones obviously annihilation is way more of like a sci-fi focused adventure this,0.1936649
kind of just has a sci-fi undertone to it but you this is way more,0.032238126
of a self-contained story and while there is clearly a larger scale thing happening in,0.027498692
the world you are very much just focused on this one family and what they're,0.045768626
going through and and how they're trying to get not out of the situation but,0.027084948
just try to live through the situation so I would 100% recommend it even if,0.022638861
you're not necessarily a horror fan if as long as you don't hate horror as,0.04511874
long as you don't hate tension I would definitely recommend going to see this in,0.061830815
theaters because I honestly believe that this should be supported I think John Krasinski did,0.035497524
an amazing job I'm a huge fan of the office and I had a really,0.010870432
hard time seeing characters in the office outside those roles or at least outside comedy,0.020310717
roles especially somebody like John Krasinski it's very hard to see him as anything other,0.05092047
than you know in gym and and this movie totally totally you know just just,0.021576561
kicks kicks that out of me and his wife in the movies actually his wife,0.49268606
in real life Emily Blunt and that itself seemed to just really add to things,0.03513367
it was just like a very beautiful project and to know that he was involved,0.027161444
in writing the screenplay to know that he directed it and just really put it,0.020872798
all together and how beautifully it was shot and how like the cinematography and just,0.158182
like little little things that happen in every scene and how it was directed and,0.05328786
flow flowed as a movie it was actually so amazingly well done and obviously you,0.060120627
had some jump scares but it didn't really go for anything cheap it kept you,0.055534188
kind of on your toes the entire time because you had something like you've got,0.21508846
a horror movie where the whole point is that people can't make noise so you,0.063188456
figured they so that tension that normally gets built in horror movies when they stay,0.05498874
quiet things down so they can jump scare you that doesn't always happen here because,0.0452857
there's just so much silence because they there's just so there's actually one character that,0.041730296
really exemplifies that silence even to to a higher degree so because you can't rely,0.059798013
on those usual auditory cues that you would in a horror movie I honestly felt,0.08345727
sick for like the first hour of the movie and I know that sounds bad,0.12644476
but it's because I was so tense and just waiting for things to happen that,0.021775452
I felt sick and I don't want to say that in a bad way I,0.03706137
want to say that that means that the movie did such an incredible job building,0.06188802
the scene building the tension just building that whole emotion in the viewer and it,0.026751025
was everybody was the same way anytime anything little happened like people were reacting people,0.04538282
were like putting putting their hands on their heads just honestly just so so amazing,0.55679005
and it wasn't in like a cheap way that horror movie usually our that was,0.05751444
just specifically going out of its way to like psyche Wow creep you out grossed,0.28878266
you out it was all just done because it was like shot incredibly well acted,0.2638189
incredibly well and you were just totally immersed in this world that they had created,0.12549953
that John Krasinski and the other people had created and I honestly blown away by,0.08798517
it it's definitely something I'm gonna buy on blu-ray because I want to support it,0.035303958
I want to support ideas like that things that are kind of unique and different,0.04603603
and just things that can take part of one genre and and blend it with,0.01749433
under on I'm tearing up because it was so good like it was just such,0.065139435
an emotional ride it was amazing so please definitely go see it if you have,0.052471682
any kind of interest in it whatsoever if you like horror movies if you like,0.10429348
dramas if you like just any kind of just like good movies just go check,0.04950829
it out it was absolutely amazing I think that it is going to be at,0.037246294
the forefront of its Jennifer for many many years to come I would say that,0.020651292
like 10 Cloverfield Lane would have tried to have a similar feel to it but,0.010777971
couldn't hit it on the same emotional scale like I think this is gonna be,0.06622169
a forerunner in its category which is so unique in that genre and also very,0.0058157006
unique for something directed by somebody who came up in the world that's a comedy,0.13917837
actor so absolutely incredible now we're going into a few more of the spoilers I'm,0.072642714
gonna talk about things specifically that I really enjoyed that they did so this is,0.016742008
this is heavy spoiler territory III honestly implore you if you have not seen the,0.046306096
movie yet and you were planning on watching the movie just don't watch past this,0.031535693
point please don't watch past I never say this but I'm actually like I would,0.04412429
really encourage you to just click off this video if you haven't seen the movie,0.057330847
yet and you're planning on seeing the movie please click off this video this is,0.042513218
just me talking about things that I really like I like even if you are,0.035064492
the type of person that likes to oilers please just click off this video please,0.14497146
please click off this video right now okay we're going into them so right from,0.18092662
the get-go you you kind of get the you know what happened it just starts,0.054693393
off and kind of like a drug store one of the kids is sick and,0.15378846
they're just kind of looking for some kind of medicine that would help him with,0.06576537
whatever he's sick with so at this point in time it's you know mom dad,0.13575932
three kids sick kid a girl and a younger younger son there isn't being this,0.23356554
moment where that kid except a toy the younger one picks up a toy has,0.043617424
batteries in it and the they take it away from him they take the batteries,0.04702782
out but then I leave the toy there but then the daughter or the sister,0.0633787
ends up just giving him back the toy but not the batteries but then he,0.028608883
grabs the batteries before he's leaving and they're walking home and for some reason he's,0.07033918
at the back honestly that was probably the only not believable thing is that if,0.024561906
this was that kind of world and you had the youngest son I'm pretty sure,0.09889485
that even if you weren't carrying him he wouldn't be at the back you'd probably,0.049753077
have him in the middle somewheres just because for one he's young too he seems,0.043412544
to not fully grasp the severity of the situation and he's like the smallest one,0.05093511
he's more prone to walk off and he's in behind the sister who I didn't,0.083216466
mention she's deaf she can't hear anything and that actually adds a really interesting dynamic,0.10129283
to the whole thing because she can't hear she can't even necessarily tell how loud,0.07528947
she's being she can't necessarily hear what things going on around her so that's an,0.04189992
interesting dynamic but I feel like you wouldn't put the youngest kid behind the deaf,0.16437952
child that's just my and he's like pretty young I would say he's probably like,0.11956277
five or six years old he was pretty young demands of turning on the toy,0.06118093
it starts making noises and everything just it's like that whole scene was shot so,0.09790572
incredibly well everything just stops nobody's saying everything everybody is just like you get it,0.10836507
you get a close-up on emily Blunt's face and like you can tell that she,0.06511948
knows it's too late John Krasinski is just flat out running just running to try,0.029408434
to catch him and like when he's I don't even know from like like from,0.0631552
here to the wall away from him something it just crashes on the wood and,0.0864772
grabs him and then it's done and like right there from the beginning they established,0.11922619
that nobody is safe not a single person in this family not a single person,0.056847926
in this movie is safe if they are willing to kill the youngest child nobody,0.49926844
is safe in this movie so that's at 89 days in and then it cuts,0.0394873
ahead to like 472 days in so it gives you about a little over a,0.021873234
year in between when that happens and and later later on so right there that,0.019531788
really set the tone for everything that's set an emotional tone right from the beginning,0.018073704
and then when it cuts ahead you find out that you know mom's pregnant with,0.13117355
another baby and that whole thing is like what happens when the baby is born,0.16363983
the babies are allowed how are you gonna deal with it just just oh my,0.10409193
god it's just dealt with so well and then there's obviously that deals with there's,0.054308917
like a whole tension because the daughter blames herself so that turns into its whole,0.22400585
other dynamic and and oh my god and then you have like you know John,0.01597771
Krasinski as a father is trying to his best take care of his family provide,0.040342722
for his family but obviously he gets a little Stern because he's just trying to,0.068289086
protect people and she kind of gets the idea that maybe he blames her for,0.06525119
you know the son the son dying but then the mom blames herself because she,0.2694349
could have been carrying him and it's just oh it's just such a good view,0.03818021
tafolla dynamic as it as it goes through there and and that just because they,0.09400109
take that kid dies so early on you're like okay absolutely nobody is safe in,0.28505588
this movie so every little time something would happen you just be you'd be waiting,0.15120023
it'd be like there's like a TVs that showed everything going around on the perimeter,0.050361052
and at one point she's watching you know John Krasinski's character you know going to,0.0237577
get the other kids and you're like oh my god she's alone and she's just,0.070638515
watching these tipi something's gonna come up behind her because it's like they're trying not,0.16248707
to make noises so they don't shut doors they don't they don't do anything that,0.03835316
can make that extra amount of noise so when these things get into houses they,0.015653102
just they can just walk in but it's they just usually don't because everything so,0.037620127
they're completely blind everything they do is based on sound in terms of the monsters,0.1404369
themselves you find out they're aliens which I you know it's cool they can go,0.07362452
like that and pander they didn't go into too much explanation they just say they're,0.038573336
heavily armored so you can't really shoot at them nobody really knows what the weakness,0.24728283
are they can't see anything and literally they're there they just have super hearing so,0.020398522
the second they can hear you they can basically find you but otherwise you're not,0.045869067
really a jeopardy from them it's very it's very interesting but I was actually surprised,0.030641684
that they showed them and they showed them really early when when the kid gets,0.02714947
attacked you see it you kind of get the idea what it looks like and,0.1938119
then it progressively kind of shows you more what they look like as the movie,0.030274503
went on more so than I thought but it's really so that they can kind,0.03873697
of exemplify what happened I actually really liked what the with the weakness ended up,0.035654508
being and it actually made like if you have something that can hear so incredibly,0.08082447
well obviously something with high frequencies would probably bother it so that was really cool,0.030662306
I like that it was self-contained I like they you know he has a whiteboard,0.06967466
with all the information they think there's three in the area by the end of,0.020097194
the movie you're left in a situation where you think that okay they could probably,0.057607565
take care of this but there's like this super emotional moment with John Krasinski protecting,0.024862569
the kids and it's like I start crying in the theater thinking you better right,0.083681434
now I want to cry and I'm like I said when I go see movies,0.041304577
I try to feel whatever the director and the creators are trying to get you,0.016102767
to feel if I feel like I'm gonna cry I don't try to hold the,0.0245792
tears back I just let him happen because that's what they're trying to get you,0.026645927
to feel and yeah here I go I'm actually crying because it was that emotional,0.059559215
it was so amazing like I said certain parts of this movie really like the,0.065857835
only other movie I can think of that elicited this kind of emotional reaction was,0.050139546
Green Mile and Green Mile is like one of the saddest movies in the world,0.060006883
and this is suppose to be a horror movie but it's just it's amazing so,0.052337978
I think that those were some of the really strong moments I know this is,0.013648238
the spoiler part but I'm really hesitant to even talk about more spoilers because I,0.042462
know some people can't help themselves some people can't help themselves but I just go,0.052818242
see it it was amazing it was so well done it wasn't one of these,0.074666865
things where you're trying to figure out how to save the rest of the world,0.026798254
but you're left in a situation we're like hey okay humanity might end up being,0.12102018
okay but it really is just focusing on this family their struggles and how they're,0.049808953
gonna make it out in the end so honestly fantastic job like literally the second,0.09410553
I finished watching the movie I like tweeted said amazing job two drunkards in ski,0.19645867
cuz I honestly think that he needs he needs an award for this he needs,0.043385275
an award for this if this is not nominated for an Oscar next year I'm,0.021783434
gonna be super pissed off you guys are gonna see a video about me yelling,0.27828413
have a ye quiet place was not nominated and I'm talking Best Picture I'm not,0.04647505
talking like cinematography I'm not talking aside stuff I'm talking best picture because this is,0.03806048
the best movie I've seen in years I think honestly because oh my god go,0.043975957
see this movie it was fantastic don't judge me for the emotional reaction that's gonna,0.040697265
do it for today's video so thank you all so much for watching have a,0.024384968
