my name is max world is fire and blood action is arguably the defining characteristic of a cinema,0.14108363
the one thing that no other medium of art can replicate even throughout,0.06983435
the silent film era with innovators like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton action was the tool for storytelling,0.05959209
that was completely unique to film cinema,0.034031805
the silent era I'm talking they were able to do things that you could see nowhere else,0.09576894
it wasn't a recording device,0.104500756
it was actually creating a language,0.06892717
most of this new language we call film language,0.14503166
it's only about 120 years old it's an acquired language,0.062347706
and it's always evolving,0.045719
and most of it was defined pretty sound before there was dialogue or sound effects the strength of the film rested entirely on the strength of its visual action,0.036119673
its ability to convey meaning with a moving image and to create an effective illusion through use of force prospective matte paintings or through editing tricks often depicting seemingly death-defying stunts that captivated audiences all over the world,0.05449167
the same is true of today where action is one of the key ingredients for a successful blockbuster every major movie franchise boasts a healthy amount of action and regardless of genre or target audience action seems to be the one component to a film that offers something for everyone across all ages and cultures but somehow even with action,0.02234043
appearing virtually everywhere Mad Max fury road managed to stand taller than any of its counterparts by a mile most films start with the script but George Miller decided from the very beginning that this film needed to work visually before anything else,0.08969422
so one of my notions was that if I make it as the action sequences as a silent,0.053153377
and it reads as a silent movie then it can only get better with self,0.14079735
I differently had the Hitchcock dictum in my head and definitely,0.24389109
he said I try to make movies where they don't have to read,0.16126747
the subtitles in Japan the film was conceived as one long chase sequence told through very little dialogue or exposition,0.052400883
"so Miller in collaboration with Brendan McCarthy opted out of a traditional script and instead drafted storyboards for the entire film that ended up totaling over 3,500 separate images representing a comprehensive shot list for every planned sequence to be filmed using what he had learned on happy feet",0.06796433
a 3d animated film that allowed for complete freedom of camera movement,0.12544422
he took that same sense of freedom into Mad Max where advancements in filmmaking technology and special effects would allow him to do things,0.14715156
he could never even imagine doing back in the 1970s but just like with the original trilogy the entire design behind the film is grounded in reality,0.052573968
by establishing a clear set of storytelling rules the kind of rules who would - that everything was basically found objects,0.1499853
repurposed so if you notice that the mask that max wears is made from a garden fork the the vehicles had to be vehicles which didn't have the most modern technology with micro processes and crunch technology and so on so everything had to,0.054843303
work for that lot logic found objects are repurposed and their that also applied to costume and language,0.109907664
and the other thing we said is we said that just because it's the wasteland it doesn't mean people can't make beautiful things,0.14954852
so all of that sort of unified the film - something we were quite rigorous about those sort of things everything came about out of story and that would lead to the stunt the guys on the,0.058524024
poles you know it's like pirates having to board a well-defended maury you can't approach it from the ground but if they can approach it from above even in what's essentially a non-stop action film storytelling comes before anything,0.11632799
else every moment of action comes from the choices of its characters in extreme circumstances those trying to survive or those trying to die historic on the fury road its mythology is so effectively established its,0.063776255
imagery so immediately evocative that we instantly understand what these characters are after and why everyone in this story is one way or another a,0.07918672
commodity Max is a blood,0.4033773
bag,0.11514793
the girls of boot breed is war boys the cannon fodder and everyone has brand on them so that you didn't have to get too much exposition you knew that people were just running away with this foundation of storytelling in place they designed every piece of clothing every weapon and every vehicle to fit within the wasteland in the world of Mad Max cars have essentially become religious artifacts and as such every component of every vehicle is designed to fit the specific character from the hundreds of unique steering wheels to the intricate detailing of the warlords million Thrones every single vehicle was fully customized and fully functional because Miller never intended to make a green-screen movie he wanted everything to be done practically if it could and that meant creating over a hundred unique vehicles that could drive at full speed at across the desert with everything rooted in logic,0.11755869
and physics even when the action feels larger-than-life it never feels impossible everything that we're seeing could theoretically happen,0.07865092
within the fictional universe that Miller created and I think that believability is crucial to its success but its believability is earned over 80% of the stunts and effects seen on screen were practical in-camera effects including the doof wagon complete with fully functional flame-throwing guitar or the blood bag sequence and even the infamous polecat scene was done the on location in camera with stunt performers being filmed while swinging on a giant pendulum on a moving vehicle nearly everything you see in the finished film was done for real every chase every every explosion and it's impossible not to feel the sheer visceral energy pumping throughout as a result,0.06594878
but while the film uses practical effects whenever possible,0.037896335
and is better for it,0.06870726
it's a film that could not and would not exist without an extensive use of CGI,0.104712285
and Miller uses it in subtle ways throughout,0.053802103
most of the film usually to erase stunts rigging or tire tracks for multiple takes films in the same location,0.082020305
there is some digital face,0.13524552
replacing to better hide stun doubles and most frequently it's used to composite different shots together when it would be too dangerous to do it any other way principle was let's do it old school and then augment it should we need to with with with digitally,0.13857134
I'm kind of averse to hundred percent CG shots if if it can be avoided I always love to have some practical live-action element in there to ground the shot even if you end up virtually replacing everything it still inherits something from the original live-action that that is a valuable thing all in all I think fury road is one of the great examples to study for understanding when and how to use CGI versus when to use practical effects,0.09610644
it's a tool like anything else,0.18822719
and when used properly can elevate a film beyond what would ever be possible with practical effects alone,0.047921892
but I think fury road makes the ultimate case for why filmmakers should resist using too much CGI when it could be done practically instead,0.061408546
because CGI is great for certain things like removing something from a shot like wires or dolly track or for seamlessly combining shots together but I doubt CGI could ever pull off a shot like this as convincingly as Miller did with practical effects,0.15236601
all films are asking us to suspend our disbelief and to go on a journey but there's a limit to what feels possible and all too often when overusing CGI or just using it in the wrong ways it starts to feel less like human beings in life-threatening situations and more like action figures being thrown around with no real consequence,0.13399835
there's a limit to what CG can believably accomplish and what human beings can believably do even the superheroes and when the scope of action and movies continually gets stretched further and further past the point of believability it loses all sense of tension,0.08686659
and granted these can still be fun movies to watch but they lack the same visceral gut punch that I believe all great action movies should have with the acclaim rightfully directed at films like Mad Max fury road Mission Impossible fall out or Dunkirk,0.17543764
it seems that most people feel the same way there's a yearning for larger-than-life action spectacle,0.10427122
that gives us a reason to see something on the big screen and both critics and audiences alike seem to appreciate the films that strike the right balance between practical and digital effects and I hope with the success of these films that more filmmakers will take on that challenge,0.06687027
because there's no doubt that it's harder,0.07339997
fury road required seven months of shooting in the Namibian desert with so much dust that they had to use leaf blowers and special fit pipes to keep it all from obscuring the lens working in harsh conditions doing incredibly dangerous stunts where there was constant risk of equipment being destroyed or worse severe injury to the stunt teams directing a film of this magnitude is like going to war,0.11296398
I was talking - Peter where is a wonderful Australian director and I just did ask it's so,0.033824243
difficult it was it was like walking a really big,0.0842081
dog I wanted to go that way the dog dragged me this,0.15669565
way and he said with George all movies like,0.04446249
that he said you've got to go into a movie as if you are patrol in the jungle with the platoon,0.24054083
you don't know where the snipers are you don't know where the landmines are and they're gonna come,0.32765135
but you've got to complete the job you try to bring it all together into that camera and capture it all it all the ingredients together at that moment,0.08452582
but there's a certain flexibility afloat you have to have and be alert to those things,0.077793375
but I think that hardship that elements of danger is felt in the finished film and it pays off,0.05418359
Mad Max fury road is action filmmaking at its absolute finest and it raises the bar for what blockbuster cinema can be,0.12403309
