thanks to curiosity stream for supporting crash course hello as you might have noticed I'm,0.04290368
not Craig or Lilly my name is Michael Aranda and I'll be your host for,0.033367608
the last third of crash course film now since we're getting to know each other,0.027866539
let me ask you a question what's your favourite film maybe there's a movie that,0.024297163
makes you want to get fit or become a spy or save the world or,0.06997732
maybe you love anything that zoe saldana is in because she's just the coolest films,0.061037917
can have an awesome story or sloppy lighting dazzling special effects or characters who are,0.018510066
just straight-up stereotypes all these things can affect how you feel about a movie or,0.041965105
whether you'd give it a thumbs up on Netflix because that's a thing now but,0.025632186
they can also affect how it fits into cinema history and impacts the world around,0.030133484
us well think critically about a lot of different movies starting with an American classic,0.061073836
that many people call the greatest film ever made it came from ambition and some,0.031492453
unusual circumstances with Orson Welles at the helm and even though it's been a long,0.02466368
time since its release in 1941 the film's technical cleverness and stories still resonate with,0.031328153
audiences today I am talking of course about Citizen Kane calling Citizen Kane one of,0.028584937
the best films of all time is a complicated claim to make to be honest,0.028964091
the idea of ranking movies and making a top 10 list may be fun but,0.015889907
it's not what film criticism is really about it's about thinking deeply about how the,0.0273457
movie works both to us as an audience member and within history in society it's,0.071785286
about understanding deconstructing feeling and learning so is Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made,0.023783641
well we can't answer that because that's not the question we should be asking but,0.014093911
there's clearly something about it that sticks with us and maybe that something is its,0.021974342
origin story Orson Welles was hoisted into the spotlight at the right young age of,0.023015354
23 when he was performing with the Mercury Theatre Company a troupe that he helped,0.017913396
create in 1938 Welles directed and narrated the radio drama the War of the Worlds,0.07316754
and supposedly struck fear into some listeners who thought that an actual alien invasion was,0.08358099
happening we know now that in the early years of the 20th century this world,0.015721615
with being what closely by intelligences greater than man but he also caught the attention,0.12592192
of studio execs at RKO one of the five film studios that reigned during the,0.0070136962
Golden Age of Hollywood not only that but they gave him complete creative control which,0.024680974
was like really unusual at the time so he did what any plucky artist in,0.034232344
his mid-20s would do he packed up his stuff and invited his buddies from the,0.053632427
Mercury Theatre Company to come with him to Hollywood now I don't want to sell,0.03333701
them short this was a group of very good actors and despite his lack of,0.111948416
experience with the movie industry Welles lept into this project with a lot of ambition,0.182553
performing experience and fresh ideas he wanted to be involved in his many aspects of,0.026266107
the film as possible from directing to starring as the film's eponymous Charles Foster Kane,0.00901989
Welles filled out his production team with other talented men from Hollywood who were itching,0.038908586
to experiment with their craft people like Gregg Toland a cameraman who contributed a lot,0.22757073
to the film's look and technical innovation and Welles is credited as co-writer with Herman,0.010071546
J mang kovitch a journalist who hopped over into the world of filmmaking and was,0.1848858
an experienced screenwriter by the time he worked on this project Citizen Kane tells the,0.018295877
life story of a wealthy newspaper magnate the first time we meet Kane he's on,0.019708062
his deathbed in a massive mansion called Xanadu dramatically murmuring his last word the story,0.087681845
is told in flashbacks through interviews with people Kane once knew like his friend and,0.03104146
fellow reporter Jedediah Leland his business manager mr. Bernstein and his second wife Susan Alexander,0.0337441
Kane in the last sequence of shots we find out that rosebud is referencing a,0.031391345
sled he had as a kid before he was separated from his family and sent,0.057638828
to boarding school with a new guardian so Citizen Kane could be a story about,0.035417702
well a lot of things a loss of childhood human flaws memory or the complications,0.069892175
of power and wealth film criticism is pretty subjective but Citizen Kane is also a,0.0072890823
story that was influenced by real life specifically tycoons like the news mogul William Randolph,0.042712107
Hearst while Welles insisted the film wasn't meant to be a personal attack on Hearst,0.12329977
all of the parallels and the fact that mang kovitch was a former friend of,0.07070636
Hearst made him take the film real personally and when you have a buttload of,0.19744247
money and power over lots of news outlets your grudges become public fast initially RKO,0.03467802
and Orson Welles planned on debuting Citizen Kane at the Radio City Music Hall like,0.015946448
other big RKO movies but the venue turned it down eventually the film's release was,0.018773478
delayed until May 1st 1941 in New York and the critical reception was actually pretty,0.048128698
good a review by Kate Cameron published on May 2nd in the New York Daily,0.029427724
News called Citizen Kane one of the most interesting and technically superior films that has,0.023592068
ever come out of a Hollywood studio the controversy did mess with the film's commercial,0.02733306
success though it didn't gain much public traction until it was released again in the,0.016749324
1950s so part of what makes Citizen Kane memorable is that it was an ambitious,0.02665923
project headed by a maverick filmmaker and had a lot of drama around its release,0.04354558
we humans do love ourselves some drama but the content of the film speaks for,0.05523419
itself to the creators of Citizen Kane had the freedom to play and innovate many,0.020631336
of their technical experiments changed the way film was being used as a storytelling medium,0.03588932
which arguably could be another way to define greatness it takes a keen eye to,0.013332276
notice some of these tricks or at the very least some good commentary tracks a,0.021529334
lot of the innovation had to do with cameras Greg Tolin the cinematographer helped pioneer,0.020814927
the use of deep focus lenses so that everything in a scene is in focus,0.02517454
at once not just the foreground or the background Citizen Kane doesn't use focus to,0.013681497
guide your attention in a scene instead things like dialogue or movement draw your eye,0.055098493
to certain people at certain times it's very much like theater where Welles had honed,0.07967038
his directing and acting jobs they use perspective to surprise you like to mess with,0.06977577
your sense of scale when Kane walks toward a normal-looking background only to be dwarfed,0.05602842
by a huge window or fireplace it's a neat visual effect but it also punctuates,0.02129519
the story with a little metaphor you're seeing this man physically shrink into his environment,0.116410464
as he's losing control over his business and life and camera movements are combined with,0.019925576
other practical effects to really immerse you in the story take the scene where Cain,0.026984505
as a kid playing in the snow or his parents are inside a cabin and,0.04386487
talking about sending him away the camera pulls back through a window and eventually stops,0.052008048
on the other side of a dining table but from the final framing you can,0.036803946
see that the table would have been in the way of the movement the trick,0.038944505
is in the set it's actually a mechanical table that splits and comes back together,0.057489827
so the Me's onset is never broken and the scene can keep playing out you,0.031011527
the viewer are none the wiser because you're wrapped up in the incredible illusion of,0.04186932
the reality the film is constructed other practical tricks are used in the Enquirer office,0.017614063
where Cain's newspaper staff works these scenes were unusual for movies at the time because,0.01796395
there are visible ceilings now this doesn't sound that weird because you know normal office,0.020226238
buildings have ceilings but production teams usually stuck lights and sound equipment above their actors,0.03365031
heads so to keep the movie magic intact they had to keep ceilings out of,0.08236902
frame in this case the lights and microphones are still up there just hidden right,0.015659753
above the ceilings which are made of muslin sheets they also cut out chunks of,0.14212647
the floor to make room for the camera so they could get dramatic low angle,0.042404793
shots making the actors look larger-than-life the trick to Citizen Kane is that all these,0.17333223
effects which are everywhere don't feel like effects in the same way a CGI dragon,0.022578329
does they subtly draw you into the world for instance wells often blends mat drawings,0.08555592
with physical sets to make everything seem more immersive despite a limited budget this is,0.021899177
how they create the beginning of the film leading us toward the window of Xanadu,0.023504265
and Kane's death bed plus it's how they make the inside of Xanadu the outside,0.10107798
of the Inquirer Building and the audience's during the big campaign speech and opera these,0.016064186
tricks were accomplished with optical printers which let them shoot in light two images are,0.23788431
seen separately and stitch them into one effects also let them add visual twists to,0.02939247
the story in ways Wells couldn't with live theater like when Susan Alexander is performing,0.06561504
in the Opera we crane up from the stage and fade into the rafters to,0.030563192
see the operas production team reacting to how awful her performance is the transition is,0.06312992
precise and deliberate and nowhere near as easy as dropping a fade into a digital,0.06196984
video editor today now maybe you noticed some of these technical tricks but they're done,0.052522235
well not obvious unless you're paying close attention and that's one of the coolest things,0.024388958
about good filmmaking but a lot of the time what makes our favorite movies so,0.016719392
memorable is just a well-told story and if you think about it Citizen Kane doesn't,0.009611904
really have a mind-blowing plot it's a straightforward tale about a powerful wealthy newspaper tycoon,0.07588482
and his shortcomings and the dialogue is all pretty crisp and generic you get a,0.027392928
newsreel summary of Kane's life at the beginning but it's mostly told through flashbacks and,0.022253718
they're part of what makes the film feel so true to life and even though,0.017135795
it's easy to link Charles Foster Kane with William Randolph Hearst this archetype of a,0.028866975
driven powerful jerk who just wants people to love him is pretty relatable to a,0.50370747
lot of us even Welles himself so you might see things you like and hate,0.113067254
about yourself in Kane or Susan Alexander's naive optimism or Jedidiah Leland and his disillusionment,0.053231988
with a friend honestly the fact that it's his childhood sled isn't the most profound,0.039332308
or surprising twist out there it's not like they're hidden identities or I see dead,0.12245432
people but you have to admit the film goes all-in on the idea of lost,0.06797179
childhood Kane drowns his feelings and material objects and tries to live vicariously through Susan,0.15433724
Alexander's youth telling her we're going to be a great opera star or maybe you,0.03232992
agree with the film critic Pauline Kael that the sled is just kind of gimmicky,0.006302615
but critics including her don't call Citizen Kane great because it makes you realize profound,0.029057218
things about life the universe and everything every scene isn't a masterpiece but the film,0.030872503
holds up over time and people seem to get a lot out of it historically,0.036523905
technically or narrative Lee and like I mentioned before the whole idea of the best,0.013924954
film of all time is ultimately kind of silly it's more about understanding why and,0.1378919
how we make movies that mean so much to us or to the world and,0.038817458
that is pretty beautiful in itself next time we'll take a hard left turn into,0.094372265
an action-adventure horror film that's almost as quotable as Casablanca James Cameron's aliens and if,0.06639065
