hey so today,0.04631967
I'm going to be talking about the film moonlight,0.05654527
I had a chance to see,0.04950767
it's why it was so good um,0.07141407
so Mumma is directed by Barry Jenkins and was co-written with Terrell mcrainey based off of a play that Terrell actually did,0.10462413
and then Barry came in and helped him finish writing the film I'm so this film is starring my harsh on lolly travante roads and Andre Holland the acting was so superb in this film I can't wait to delve into that,0.1059533
and they let in the later part of this video,0.11308778
but who this one was so good that has he is twice,0.087452926
I'm the first time I saw it was through a USC,0.06766818
so University of Southern California I went to their cinema school,0.10984932
so there is the African American cinema society aacs and they put on an event with another group named queer cut,0.15347472
and that's how I was able to see this film before I hit theaters and then of course my friend she's an actress and she invited me to see it again,0.15288582
and I was like all right I'll go ahead and see it twice,0.068658166
because that's how good it was,0.05956596
and I also want to make sure that supported in the box office it's sometimes hard for people who get like exclusive sneak peeks and get to see films beforehand just do to like industry connections,0.057233438
but then we forget that you have to support,0.049905732
it opening weekend,0.06163743
when it comes to the box office,0.08397842
so this is a limited release but it's definitely more cities,0.068990126
now I know it's in Los Angeles and San Francisco New York and a few other places so look it up,0.0357952
and if it's in your area go see it if it's about a couple hours away,0.25046608
it's our trust me it's worth the draw it's worth the drive for sure and i'm originally from sacramento,0.08046793
so all my sacramento people i promise you is worth that drives to the Bay Area next time you're in the bay go ahead and check it out was so good so really love the music in this film the music was actually heavy and played a big role in it because it's interesting like typically in films on here that much music so it kind of like a music video at time,0.1489205
and I really like that because in films called the number one critique are always skates that put too much music in my film they always critique me on that,0.117121555
so I love this film because I'm like finally it worked someone proved that you can have multiple songs playing really loud in films and it just actually adds to the flume except taken away,0.087022826
but I always always always had that as a critique that like I didn't that,0.052720908
I've put too much music in my film so I really let's see so I sometimes I did think that this man fini style music was a little too much,0.2624117
I think that the characters or the actors express their emotions enough and that the music wasn't really needed,0.04142428
and I feel like it just was forcing me to be more sad trying to be a tearjerker,0.34589857
but the film was a tearjerker on its own,0.1151719
there is no need for that,0.06661288
so something left out the symphony music was a little too much,0.11327636
but I did like how they're different um,0.06466235
there are different song choices for each version or sirens life,0.06507171
so when I looked on the playlist once but on Spotify like the soundtrack to the film there's like a certain song for Sharon,0.085789666
and the child chevron has a teen then as an adult somebody like how they play with those musical scores and how they gave a different musical score to each character to one character,0.05669093
but for each section of his life as he grew so I really like that um also classic man by Gina chopped n skrewed was Jean yes like it was so good when he pulled up and like put on a fresh tea to go meet with Kevin after all these years and was playing classic man and it was just it was perfect,0.18996541
I love it um,0.104362495
yeah it was perfect that really reminds me a lot of like a typical Florida against the kind of dude so they embodied that role so well so well um,0.23798186
and also I really really like the song it's pronounced coo coo coo coo coo paloma um and that's the song that's played in the middle either in the car and it's like,0.26611295
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah koo koo roo Paloma and it's so beautiful,0.24036804
I did look it up online and luckily I caught like a live version with an orchestra in the back and this man singing live in it's just such a beautiful song,0.1226522
so I suggest you all look it up,0.11427242
it wasn't on the Spotify soundtrack and to the film moonlight,0.06540678
but I found it online on YouTube and it was just so beautiful sea I love the way they used music at times I thought it was a bit too heavy and made it a little bit too emotional,0.14961363
but everything about it was just so perfect,0.050007444
I love love love,0.063744016
they used a lot of music in this the directing and the writing were so good so very jenkins said that he was pulled out of retirement after seeing a play that l wrote that was a sort of based off of the film moonlight so to pull Barry Jenkins out of other words hired me like,0.05231885
and now I understand why because this story is so good and he was saying it also relates a lot to his personal life,0.093632646
so what I thought was really interesting from listening to the interview again on fresh Air's that Barry was saying thats frills,0.076795876
I really quiet,0.043049812
and he was saying in the okay so barians,0.12409949
ro actually know each other actually grew up in the same like apartment complex,0.051148836
they went to the same school at the same time,0.06957688
in elementary,0.033504777
so they've known each other for a very long time,0.0899954
and bury the director was sent teams to the co-writer Terrell Amen as long as I've known you still can only say about six words and it's interesting because that's also a line that Kevin uses for sure on in this,0.08191125
so i love how even though of course the variant or aren't romantically together they still kind of see themselves in the worlds of kevin and in shy Ron and I think that plays really well for the two writers because they're sort of expressing their friendship through this um this lovers storyline,0.098705836
so I really like that and the lighting was so so so so good I love when we see this like pink lighting on the mom she's yelling at chevron as a kid and Barry said that he did that because he remembered his mom being like with the angry and being on drugs,0.46328115
and he was a really young child like he like under five years old and he just sort of i think as a kid who just sort of remember things and colors you don't really know what's going on,0.17516847
and that's why it's silence when she's yelling at him at first and juicy colors because in our memory that's what we see as kids no colors and kind of see actions,0.1869995
so i thought that was so beautiful,0.08458233
but the pink the hot pink sort of added to her her anger England,0.1737605
hear what she was saying we could just tell her she was screaming,0.15661216
and the pink colors X the passion so so well lit and of course the blue on the black on the dark black skin representing the moonlight,0.3638653
they reflected off the black skin that my harsh realities character explains and that's how you got his nickname blue cuz,0.48121774
she was saying when the moonlight comes out and the boys play in the street in Cuba that it makes the black boys with blue,0.281618
so I really loved a thought I was I'm so beautiful and of course using blue light on dark skin,0.3443279
actors is you have two very talented,0.11129408
you know how to light dark skinned people in general because a lot of people just teach you how to how to light white actors in films gorgeous,0.66453284
give practice on different sets,0.06509123
you just have more opportunities to light white people vs dark-skinned people,0.70107317
but the way that the colors reflected off his skin especially the night scenes and the scenes and the water,0.15374961
it was just so beautiful,0.07775613
so I love love love than not the lighting in here,0.1527094
it really helped tell this story more um and also I just love like it was sort of like a love story between the writer and director about their friendship but also the love story between shy Ron and Kevin and I'm a huge sucker for love story,0.446461
so this one was so beautiful um,0.0825786
yeah I just I loved it it was all about like falling in love with the hood Florida man,0.29468605
and i loved it was so good,0.10136405
so yeah i'm directing and writing were amazing and two talented people i'm so glad i was into the interview so again go to I'm npr's website National Public Radio watch the show fresh air it's hosted by terry gross and there's an interview on there should be one of the most recent ones and it's with bear jenkins and terrell mccraney and adds so much more detailed and insight so I saw the film first then I listened to the interview and I went and saw the film again and it helped me so much well I'll just like unpacking the film and then with my own emotions and find my personal connection to the film I just want to say that all the actors did such a great job in this film they were superb,0.10086425
there's a riveting performance from everyone,0.07789499
I was shocked by the younger actors the teenage actors everyone did is such a great job but for the character of Kevin I literally love those actors so much,0.03982225
they were my favorite,0.058448058
they made me kind of like this fall in love more with Kevin,0.11283923
he's the love interest in the film so I think it sort of worked,0.057997912
but they honestly did the best so Kevin as a teenage was played by jor-el Jerome such a cutie,0.051749624
and I think he did an amazing job he felt more comfortable in his role as well I think he's supposed to be more confident actor because obviously our confident character because obviously Kevin is more confident and himself,0.06321123
then I'm shy Ron is then also of course Andre Holland just like killed it as adult version of,0.38639382
Kevin but I really thought all the actors for the character of Kevin were just perfect on spot you can,0.040610578
so they're comfortable with their role,0.052150816
they knew everything,0.061492633
they were supposed to do from their body language the way they spoke to their tone to everything one of my favorite lines Andre hollandaise um when he looks at shy Ron and he's like man right up in front song,0.15834856
and it's funny because like a gold grill and like it's called a front like oh your gold fronts,0.14967375
that's what they're called,0.05886583
but it's sort of a play on words because the word front end is also slang for someone who's faking the truth or not showing who they really are,0.17193414
so he keeps like adding line,0.11487685
we got confront song like that,0.107238986
but he's actually saying like why are you fronting um,0.099703774
so I just I really like to play on words of course,0.06315699
I was more not to go riding,0.11800009
but just the way he delivered that bad line it could have been very very corny like very corny,0.4636942
but he just uses like more of a play on words not I really loved it,0.12694249
so he was so smooth and again both jor-el and Andre were so confident and comfortable in their roles,0.059104238
so they did an amazing job,0.061383452
you've seen the crackhead black mom over and over again or the drug addict mother over and over again,0.7635597
but Naomi Harris just adding something different to it and also get a nod to the writing wasn't it was a more loving depiction of a of a drug abusing mother,0.5484477
you know what I mean even though he wanted to hate Naomi cares no me Harris his character,0.48364404
we sort of so had love for her especially at the end much I wrong goes and visits her at the rehab center the halfway house,0.10822657
so even though she's like obviously being a horrible mother,0.6707279
and she has that scene where she's telling him not to treat Janelle monáe's character better than her cuz,0.20684335
she is his mom as she's hustling him down for money,0.5149738
she's obviously doing the action that isn't that proves he's not a good mom,0.31089434
but this means verbally saying like I am your mom,0.49425483
you're my one and only,0.09432015
so she just she nailed it she killed it she's amazing so happy to see what role,0.645903
she does after this,0.0918169
it was just a beauty to see her on-screen um also I've talked about mahakali and other things I first saw him in house of cars,0.08612713
then I found out he was in cakes,0.087935135
and then I saw him on Luke Cage,0.10946147
so he's killing it with the netflix TV shows,0.6636483
and also the independent films,0.06513698
so I love the roles that he's choosing he is very talented,0.09053435
he could play a villain if you pay good guy and play a politician that you can play hood he's just really nice,0.1592609
I mean it's interesting,0.08004598
because in the film kicks maresciallo also plays a like gangster father figure um and he does that as well in this film but he switches it up,0.20680882
he's actually supposed to be from Cuba in this film,0.12657887
and I love how it's sort of a similar character,0.06931785
but he didn't play it the same way and that shows you the true talent of an actor anyway I can go on and on about my her shallow,0.19130081
so I also wanted to talk about Janelle Monae this is the first time I've seen her on screen I'm i knows she's also in the film hidden figures coming up we'll be doing a review on that too hopefully,0.06865911
but you know when I was really good I think towards the end there were times where I thought she could have been a bit stronger,0.16736816
when she was making up the bed with the character of shy,0.24160159
Ron,0.099277824
and she was like why would you you know do a bad job making up the babe try and make me come over here and fix it on purpose,0.47539592
I thought that wasn't that strong um but she's still budding actress so I thought the way she played off on my her shala was really good when she played with the younger version and shy ron was really good so I enjoyed her and I loved her in this world I'm happy to see her getting work also her hair looked perfect like in every scene oh how she does it,0.19294389
and Janelle Monae must have must be drinking from the fountain of youth,0.28807798
me,0.05275283
my friend watching it were like why she was 19 like why does she look so young bene Raia,0.18882534
it's like all-star amazing cast fresh faces and some of them some of these faces we've seen before if you off all theater you've seen some of these faces before but either way these are not like a list celebrities yet they killed,0.5577398
it is a very talented talented group in the acting was amazing in this film so everyone go support the field might it is an incredible film,0.09556468
I can't guarantee that,0.030779278
i'll make you cry,0.40324718
but it'll definitely make you think and feel i think this,0.09073728
one was very important right,0.058005277
now to tell the narrative of a young black boy a young poor black boy,0.6526196
and a young poor black boy from the south especially with the way that black men and women and young people are dying in this country,0.5876557
I'm and being targeted by police and other racist,0.5908836
people which is really important to show this side that even though someone might have a criminal record and might look very aggressive,0.19482267
they actually just a very very soft heart warming person on the inside,0.12075631
so I think this one so incredible perfect for our time right,0.09926753
now,0.031218953
I think this is a part of the black artists of our time healing us because our people need a lot of healing right now,0.40326676
so this is definitely one for the books,0.06809996
it's a classic,0.11589628
I love it so much,0.076431766
so yeah go support moonlight,0.086573765
thanks for watching this review in see you next time,0.077647515
