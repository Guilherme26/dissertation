everyone in I am back for my very first criterion collection review man or my,0.046389908
first official a criterion collection review I'm really excited to start this recently I've gotten,0.0546016
sort of into the history and the curation and things of that nature of the,0.01626108
criterion collection I have a small collection of criterion films uh eight I think yes,0.029764308
on DVD but for my personal cartoon review series I'm starting naturally at the very,0.058921304
beginning with spine number one Legrand illusion the 1937 French escape film which I enjoyed,0.0072890823
far more than I thought I would I actually sort of started this film a,0.033354968
couple months ago when my friends and I were doing criterion watch along which I,0.046626046
at the time was intrigued by but not too interested in so I actually only,0.022128664
ended up watching one of them even though we had like nine or something that,0.095449865
we went through which was 400 blows which I had to enjoy and obviously off,0.055647932
getting up to that soon because I think that's spine number five but I did,0.018641107
start it I watched a few minutes and I the beginning starts off in just,0.0515065
a French military base and I honestly thought that that's what the whole entire movie,0.03929772
was gonna be I didn't know I think about it I hadn't heard anything I,0.024653701
hadn't read any reviews so I sort of dismissed it and I just closed the,0.019799192
page and I didn't watch anymore so when I restarted it's mine I recommend at,0.048014287
the beginning but then basically right after the point where I'd stopped it transition BAM,0.033652306
straight into a German World War 1 German a prisoner of war camp and I,0.4165566
was surprised and it ended up being a lot better than I thought it would,0.026599364
be um so let's start off with a quick summary the grand illusion follows the,0.025975421
story of the lieutenant Marshall a French sort of working-class guy along with his captain,0.030614411
de boeldieu I don't speak French so sorry I've had butcher the pronunciations and alongside,0.28536373
a group of other prisoner French officers including Rosenthal who becomes one of the more,0.09042107
main characters and it's an escape film they try to get out a couple of,0.028582277
times and in that set of escapes they get sent off to a more high-security,0.057115994
prison that's basically a fortress it's on top of a plateau and it's like a,0.12677935
castle it's pretty crazy and it's it's you can just expect when it will be,0.11594749
there's gonna be different clever escape that it's gonna be characters bouncing ideas off of,0.020422468
each other and it's a lot more interesting that I thought it would be so,0.037965357
for the actual review um this movie is a lot funnier and a lot more,0.037985314
not okay not a funny but has a humorous and upbeat tones that I was,0.018174812
not expecting um it's a it's a World War one film it's a war film,0.09003127
but it doesn't have any fighting it's all all of it takes place in prisoner,0.08365017
of war camps with these French officers sort of screwing around and I'm sorry I,0.49660373
think there's someone parking just outside with the radio I don't know if that camera,0.01999409
is getting that but um and they're there they're just a funny group they one,0.027751463
of the guys who I can remember his name is especially just the Joker of,0.03540174
the group and he's always he's always singing and bouncing around and taking the best,0.058793586
of every situation he gets into and he gets into some weird situations and it,0.06206496
it's honestly it makes the movie a lot more a lot more personal and comedic,0.048631575
and shows the best of humanity and alongside that um alongside that hopefulness is the,0.025702696
French pastry Tisza much this movie has a lot of there's a lot of like,0.05121914
in Casablanca weather um all singing and that I'm just being proud of their country,0.02776676
lots of French patriotism which goes along with their their upbeat their positivity and it,0.03482569
it's a french film and you expect that and i honestly thought that it made,0.030235922
the tone a lot more a lot more interesting because i really could have gone,0.0390822
for just a dark and gritty atmosphere for this but really you don't feel depressed,0.07629191
or sad like it's not crushing movie like you could have expected it to be,0.08117702
for a prisoner movie really this movie is also primarily in French obviously but because,0.04595754
it takes place in Germany and there are also prisoners from other countries during the,0.03867045
war as well it switches between French German and occasionally English like few sentences of,0.23919046
English and this is not a knock on the movie but the captions on the,0.056528635
website that I was watching this on could not keep up they kept sort of,0.04057088
switching and people will be talking in French and German and for some reason they,0.115842395
just didn't do the closed caption completely so there might have been a couple lines,0.01888922
that I missed but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the movie so,0.022646843
that's no knock against the movie a couple negatives that I have a fare gushing,0.021811372
so much about the movie is that I really think it starts too quickly as,0.022650834
I said it goes straight from the the French military camp to the prisoner of,0.23061159
war camp within within just seconds like really it's it's about a minute and a,0.110161066
half that switches and I really think it starts too quickly you don't really get,0.03403545
to know the main characters that well you just really learned their relationships throughout the,0.01727482
movie or how they how they interact with each other and that kind of leaves,0.03208713
them feeling connected but not necessarily personalized because you don't know their history don't know,0.022509815
their motives really and I don't know it just a gripe that I have also,0.05777985
another thing is that it's kind of hard to tell how much time passes between,0.02544394
scenes because it sort of just jumps from moment to moment like I've seen will,0.023641292
end just to fade out and then there'll be a newspaper and it could be,0.040040728
like two weeks later or something I don't know interesting but not really bad this,0.028846353
movie just a little bit of trivia as well was the first foreign film to,0.026471648
be nominated for an Oscar it was nominated for Best Picture in 1937 and I,0.025299596
mean that's really quite interesting and it's also the obviously the first film to really,0.025828416
just by the criterion collection again I don't know I know they used to do,0.021295855
laser discs and VHS but I don't know if they did lug around illusion for,0.20372048
the first one of those but it's the first of the DVD blu-ray section of,0.055340618
the criterion collection so little trivia my review I thought it was great surprisingly humorous,0.06692213
has a lot of depth of character and atmosphere and I enjoyed it it's an,0.019558394
8 out of 10 for me I have a few gripes about it which prevent,0.098603494
me from giving a higher score but it is a movie you should see especially,0.06405319
if you want to get into criterion considering it's the first spine and that's it,0.022710035
