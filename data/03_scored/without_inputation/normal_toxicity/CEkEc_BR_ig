hey everyone today,0.04774076
I've got the favorite movie review what do you get when you have royalty drama with the - of comedy a movie that could be my,0.10490585
favorite so as far as the story,0.05002506
goes Jurgis lanthum us directs this period peace movie that is set in the 18th century where there is a war going on between England and France but nothing stirs the team war then when you have to do whatever it takes to make the current Royal on the throne happy even in the ailing state that she's in I was really curious to know what this movie was all about it's already got ten nominations - this,0.15873022
year's Oscars so it obviously is something,0.05550678
pretty impressive,0.04231635
and when I saw it I literally didn't know what to expect it has a young woman that has this chance to work as a maid for the Queen and it gets turned into what looks to be this fight to know their place among all the other employees that work at the palace and like I said this is a dramatic film it's also got this comedy that you know brings it all together with these ideas of gaining power and it sometimes is shown in a ridiculous way especially when certain women of this film especially the leading ladies have to do whatever,0.44217694
it takes to get attention,0.05823917
they're all sort of going off and doing their own thing and it just makes for this really interesting yet entertaining film as far as the casting goes,0.083944984
you've got Olivia Colman who plays queen and I liked her a lot in this movie I think she definitely pulls off the royal lead well and also considering the fact that she's going to be in crown,0.1665133
season three is Queen Elizabeth,0.14856397
I think that's also proving,0.05587073
she's got the acting chops to wear a crown upon her head,0.33388034
and this time she plays this role with some vulnerability because she's ailing,0.5154597
she's always in pain,0.39436966
she's always getting help from Rachel vices character who plays Lady Sarah,0.12695368
and they always seem to appear to have this interesting relationship on-screen probably more,0.046380255
so that I originally thought which was really surprising to me not like that was all done pretty well,0.1499479
and of course I'm a huge fan of Rachel vice,0.046407036
because she's just been really impressive and she's also worked with the director on the lobster as well as Olivia Colman,0.15799662
so I thought like that was a pretty nice reunion to see there,0.050087035
and then when you have Emma Stone brought in who plays Abigail and she's the maid that also gets to have some encounters with the Queen,0.11737567
I thought it was like okay,0.099617906
I definitely felt like there was something going on with her character that just seemed to really have some kind of frustration,0.13231662
I mean it didn't help when you know people were mistreating her and then Lady Sarah takes her under her wing and everything's supposed to be cool and called it the cucumber but know things just get crazier from there,0.3300787
and of course Nicholas Hoult I also love to have in a movie like this as well,0.1347605
so the things that I liked about this movie was obviously right off the bat seeing that production design the art direction and the costume design just really pulled off this period piece very well and I also really enjoyed the cinematography throughout and especially when you're constantly seeing a camera following the actors around I mean there's just always movement,0.060984418
there's always some bustling going on in the palace at just looking around their life through a spyglass lens which I thought was really cool because I did not expect to see that in a movie like this and despite it sometimes being dizzying to watch then you've got the music going on so makes it even a peer hectic with this royal life and how that can all be especially with the current state of things that were going on during that time whether this is not exactly based off of true events,0.05852925
it's kind of like almost an inaccurate way of portraying this time period but there is some imagery that depicts the savagery of what is supposed to be this prim and proper royal lifestyle and things are just going on left and right that you really don't expect to see,0.16663967
but unfortunately the things that I didn't really like about this movie was that I will admit this movie at times is really boring to watch and I almost fell asleep watching it,0.10275916
so I kind of feel bad that that happened,0.15274872
but sometimes it was hard to follow what exactly was going on because there are certain things that are being talked about that I'm just like what the heck is this like something about like a treaty or trades or something going on with different countries and people's relationships with one another,0.31089434
I mean it was all just sort of like going on in my head,0.21005113
I don't know if that's going to make or break me to want to see it again for a second viewing,0.10552207
so overall,0.06683016
I would say that the favorite while it's not my favorite movie of all time,0.10031712
I definitely wouldn't stop me from seeing it again,0.14618549
and I may or may not recommend it because some people might be able to handle a movie like this unlike me but I still thought it was at least a very interesting movie nonetheless,0.11292118
so I would give this three hearts on the heart rate scale,0.12115941
