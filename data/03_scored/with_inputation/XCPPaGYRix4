on fire and um i just recently discovered this film it was actually kind of,0.108866505
recommended to me by multiple people and uh i didn't know anything about this movie,0.14903827
going into it like i didn't even really know the basic plot of it i,0.1361579
just knew like people were into it and said it was a great movie so,0.10407278
i was like i'll watch it and let me tell you it's probably one of,0.10200867
the best movies that i've seen in a long time and the basic story is,0.047548775
a young woman who's been i think she was like in a nunnery or something,0.24251682
like she was going to be a nun um she gets word that her sister,0.15130088
has passed away and she needs to come home because they need to marry her,0.19167693
off because this was back in the days when they would marry the daughter off,0.10418572
to a man who could give the family status or you know he had a,0.06946224
lot of like great wealth so they since the daughter had died they needed this,0.25898632
other daughter to come back to be given away so she comes back we don't,0.16589427
really see her until a little bit later in the movie and they hire someone,0.20130295
and i guess back in those days they hire um someone to paint your portrait,0.13938528
to send to the potential suitor husband so they hired this girl i believe her,0.14625743
name is marianne and she comes and basically the story rolls out from there it,0.052614603
was just the main two actresses were so good they're french actresses i looked them,0.18198311
up to see if i had seen them anything and i hadn't and they were,0.10226533
just so good and there might be some light spoilers here um in the next,0.052636012
part i'm getting into so there is a lesbian relationship in this film and i,0.53490317
kind of saw it going there so basically the girl who's come back to be,0.29916677
married away is um doesn't want to get doesn't obviously want to get married she,0.09516358
wanted to become a nun and uh the mother is very persistent and uh is,0.18592823
basically forcing her and she falls the the daughter falls in love with the girl,0.31089434
who came to paint her portrait and you would think like oh is that going,0.10678214
to be cheesy like it's based in like the seaside like scenic town in france,0.30049995
and um but it's just so well written and so well done and by the,0.05425557
end of the movie you just want them and their love to succeed and i,0.27773303
feel like this movie it's obviously based around um this painter and her view of,0.10436741
this world and the um this girl that she's fallen in love with and the,0.31559572
whole movie is beautifully shot it looks like every shot in the film looks like,0.24168809
a painting and i know they had to have done that on purpose but it,0.06166528
was just gorgeous to watch every single scene whoever the cinematographer was in this was,0.0906497
a plus because it it was beautiful and i it's one of those movies i,0.112007804
bought i watched this like maybe like a week or so ago and it has,0.05841457
completely stuck with me and i can't get i can't get some of the imagery,0.14999413
and scenes out of my head and the ending is so i'm not giving too,0.26572305
much away but i'm going to say how the ending made me feel so if,0.17595856
you don't want to kind of know like the like what could possibly happen like,0.08426105
you could try to figure it out don't watch this part but um the ending,0.12542608
is so heart-wrenching and sad and i just like i couldn't believe like i usually,0.05485654
don't cry that much during movies but i like sobbed at the end of this,0.08827781
movie and there are some call backs and there's this final scene and again i'm,0.06250641
not going to spoil anything but there's a final scene with one character and it,0.057792734
just stays the shot stays on the character and it's just like oh my gosh,0.15240124
i'm seeing this person's raw emotions and it was like almost too overwhelming and it,0.23386297
felt very real like you're seeing something you're really not supposed to be seeing and,0.1590972
you feel like oh i'm like looking into this person's like soul and seeing all,0.24131976
the intimate workings and i'm like oh but um it's such a good movie if,0.087068655
you haven't seen it it's obviously it's a french film i don't know if i,0.15022486
