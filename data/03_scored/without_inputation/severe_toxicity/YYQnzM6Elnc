now this movie has been my most anticipated one of the year I love crime,0.08734393
drama centering on mob activity and as a lifelong fan of DeNiro Scorsese Pacino and,0.07680876
Pesci you could pretty much say this was my Avengers in game for 2019 and,0.103022315
had three and a half hours long I was not at all worried about the,0.022773227
runtime and after watching I can say that Scorsese does use every minute to tell,0.028887596
this story it could have honestly been longer and still not lost its appeal because,0.050287217
I think there are so many inner 20 dynamics in this era to cover its,0.025677418
a strong 70 style movie with a very atmospheric tone that does a good job,0.039942946
of luring the viewer in and with compelling characters played by world-class actors the result,0.03665029
to me is my pick for best film of the year as you would expect,0.031159198
from a Scorsese film it takes its time to develop the characters and the multiple,0.03814296
layers of the story the events covered in this one spans several decades there are,0.014582821
a lot of moving pieces that I thought each were able to bring their own,0.020409165
level of intrigue and appeal the various subplots do weave together nicely to create curiosity,0.061255433
and a foreboding tension of what's to come Jimmy how was a very charismatic figure,0.030771395
in his era I enjoyed how this plotline built the foundations to his Union dealings,0.041852023
his positions with the Teamsters as well as how all of that intertwined with the,0.04158928
political world as well as organized crime I mean Jimmy Hoffa had put himself in,0.11863085
the sights of many powerful figures and when and how that was going to manifest,0.012605895
itself was very interesting to see play out the script from Stevens ah Leon doesn't,0.025433296
spoon-feed the viewer exposition either it does kind of expect a certain level of historical,0.049200308
knowledge yet it is tightly informative when needed to keep that emotional connection locked in,0.048956852
while things are progressing the story is told from the perspective of Sheeran with a,0.0108710965
flashback approach that I thought allowed for some effective narration from DeNiro many times while,0.035196863
watching a scene the commentary from DeNiro would come in to really add some dramatic,0.04957547
layering and many times some insight to what fueled the visuals being depicted on screen,0.03119046
the consistent time line with DeNiro recounting the events of the story also did create,0.022193188
a smooth flow from scene to scene as time periods would change and overall I,0.048881687
enjoyed it what was going on in the world around these focal characters was developed,0.037347402
nicely through the conversations and that is where I thought the phenomenal cast really came,0.024879863
into play nicely this film thrives on the performances from De Niro Pesci and Pacino,0.05592997
the result to me is a string of amazing scenes that were absolutely compelling and,0.027846582
nostalgic and just constantly entertaining I mean sitting back and watching these actors work off,0.101020776
one another just brought a smile to my face it's the timing between them that,0.028570969
was flawless and to me it just felt like there was a subtle enjoyment between,0.03735871
all of them but I thought translated extremely well on-screen as well as into these,0.04712826
characters but Chino was a very charismatic hapa with the larger-than-life personality that you would,0.086788505
want Pesci was subtly intense as a higher up in the Bufalino family and De,0.052731104
Niro in the lead was a layered character as a former soldier turned to mob,0.037383985
hitman and union leader they all were able to easily bring their spring presents to,0.12843765
the rolls but they were also able to disappear inside of these characters and that's,0.043491703
something that you really need when you have high-profile talent taking on the role of,0.042197254
real-life figures and the story couldn't possibly cover all the events that took place over,0.0244149
this years but I thought it did manage to do a good job of getting,0.033754744
the full spectrum of events inside there were some gaps in some information here and,0.022050837
there but there was still a strong continuity to it and admittedly reading up on,0.016363518
the real-life events will add some more depth to the backdrops of many of the,0.020588765
time periods while you're watching the talking point of this movie certainly is going to,0.034705292
be the de-aging of the cast that aspect of the post-production is what ballooned the,0.03651326
budget and caused many delays in this movie being released but the result was well,0.028231725
worth it in my opinion the various ages of the characters depicted was absolutely impressive,0.02678761
there were long stretches where I absolutely forgot about it which does speak a great,0.031435914
deal to what the technology was able to pull off with this movie there wasn't,0.026911335
just an age styling to the movie already one that kind of gives a strong,0.021910485
time period atmosphere to the film the color palette is slightly subdued which does allow,0.013958214
the de-aging to blend in nicely with the surroundings to give everything a nice seamless,0.05180783
solid look this movie really does take you on a historical journey filled with friendship,0.036706828
loyalty political intrigue and a lot of mob violence the characters are continually being explored,0.07795287
as are their relationships with one another and it all blends in together into a,0.023175664
great mob epoch the violence is very Scorsese asket comes out of nowhere hits with,0.13620034
impact but never does it feel forested as you would expect from Scorsese in this,0.031724602
genre it maintains a grounded realistic vibe complemented with dialogue that is just very intentional,0.04268816
imprinting with a lot of meaning it's very intense and climactic but never theatrical and,0.030999554
melodramatic the sense of humor splashes it nicely through the personality of the characters and,0.038017906
this one doesn't just tell a story it creates an immersive setting with everybody in,0.018947756
here bringing their a-game Joe Pesci is an incredible talents he's only done I think,0.08153555
like two movies since the 90s but I mean seeing him back in a role,0.06045987
of this type was very nostalgic it showed he still very much has what it,0.02493973
takes to create an imposing mob figure out Pacino still has that energy that adds,0.06253857
such a strong vibrant charisma to any role that he has in DeNiro was every,0.028876953
bit to leave this movie needed with a performance that I simply think is award,0.074527174
worthy for what this movie said to accomplish it absolutely succeeds and the Irishman from,0.04227109
me is going to get 100% on the entertainment meter I absolutely loved it it,0.0512963
could have been longer and still pulled more layers of this just fascinating era and,0.026684508
post-war American history yet as it was it was compelling from the opening scene up,0.111508064
until the end with the screen title I heard you paint houses closing everything out,0.011812996
I think the direction from Scorsese was polished it really left the performers capture the,0.013746685
mood and intensity with a visual appeal that really served as a complement to the,0.016470613
story not something that attempted to overshadow it and I couldn't recommend checking this movie,0.031453874
out more either in theaters if you can or when it hits Netflix now for,0.033789333
