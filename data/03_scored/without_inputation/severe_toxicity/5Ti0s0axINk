you would think that after three versions three high-profile versions of this exact same story,0.022278996
well actually Bradley Cooper has made a significant change which we'll discuss in just a,0.0117697595
moment but anyway you would think at this point there wouldn't be any magic left,0.042511888
in this story but you would be wrong and what makes this version of a,0.033309072
stars born truly shine is the following first off a movie star truly is being,0.01958234
born here with Lady gaga you know Bradley Cooper kind of short changes are within,0.15468313
the movie but I think he makes up for it by giving her you know,0.064629905
like setting her on her way as a movie star right if you I mean,0.143981
the movie focuses more on Bradley Cooper which might disappoint some Lady Gaga fans but,0.03192083
little monsters if you've come to worship at the altar of Gaga don't worry you'll,0.23914589
get in a lot of praying you'll have you'll have your religious experience watching this,0.044643134
movie then ask for Cooper he's definitely given himself the role of his career the,0.018938443
sound design is really really good I mean I know it's a movie about the,0.023131097
music industry but I didn't expect the sound to be that good very very good,0.014677277
make sure you buy tickets for a theater that has a very good sound system,0.024129536
the press screening was anna dolby atmos made a difference that also finally it's a,0.014894792
sophisticated realistic depiction shockingly realistic and sophisticated actually of what it means to be a,0.021946404
successful artist particularly in the music business today now speaking of Cooper what did he,0.0115382755
do what did he do well as the director co-writer and one of the film's,0.011560227
producers for the first time ever in this story the older male role is made,0.025741277
to be extremely sympathetic in the past he's been under the character's unsympathetic villified almost,0.03351395
even and is really horrible in his treatment of the young female ingenue right and,0.11584107
also in the past his character who's been a husband you know his career is,0.016704092
really on the rocks but here Bradley Cooper's career is actually in pretty good shape,0.042472642
and he things never really get that bad to be honest with you and so,0.04193717
the reason I'm bringing this up at the front of the review is that it,0.025340836
makes a huge difference in the movie and the movie as I said actually leans,0.022784535
more towards Cooper than it does Gaga when in the past the female character has,0.025588285
really been the focus and also even more so because this is still a very,0.006171574
sad story bring tissues someone asked me how many tissue should I bring the whole,0.052112482
box but so well you might also get a little bit annoyed particularly if you're,0.052468356
a Gaga fan but between the two people someone's got to look worse than the,0.046910748
other one and since Cooper is practically playing a Christ figure Gaga comes off as,0.03885005
John grateful and uncaring especially in the third act I actually thought uncharacteristically so for,0.025334185
how kind her character was in the beginning in the moment so yeah basically what,0.029749673
you have here is that Bradley Cooper and taken no chances that someone else is,0.022549726
gonna win an Oscar for his movie okay he is definitely stacked the dick I,0.6918396
also have to say that the movie is way too long and the problem there,0.01823468
is that it feels too long right and it could easily lose half an hour,0.02347034
easily lose half an hour but thankfully there are such brilliant moments throughout like breadcrumbs,0.030129494
right combined with powerhouse performances you're still kept engaged in the core of the film,0.0295581
naturally is Cooper and Gaga's relationship which seems so deep and so real that it's,0.025324872
a credit to both actors and also Cooper's directing of the scenes it's really good,0.023672557
stuff now Cooper is doing a mean Sam Elliott impression and Sam Elliott by the,0.012761548
way is in the movie playing his brother and there's even a commentary on the,0.02794636
fact that Bradley Cooper's doing a Sam Elliott impression yeah Cooper brings vulnerability and kindness,0.027938379
to the role and he ultimately moves it beyond just being a Sam Elliott impression,0.010566442
and he breaks your heart again unless you're Lady Gaga fan and you're like want,0.090455666
you to go Gaga but he his character I thought was just so charming but,0.054040186
also speaking of breaking your heart he also delivers an incredibly convincing and realistic portrayal,0.058474965
of an addict not just the behavior but the motivations to do such things and,0.048906296
also the repercussions of the whole situation really interesting then with gaga all right so,0.08688097
she starts out on her only false note in the movie and I feel of,0.07848568
Cooper was a little more protective of her he would have you would have changed,0.03262659
the scene and it's a short scene clearly written by a group of men three,0.15621506
men wrote this screenplay for a woman because any woman will tell you that we,0.08695946
don't go into the ladies room and scream amen we just don't do it we,0.084998496
might be thinking it sometimes we don't really verbalize it like that it just rang,0.033040337
false but for the rest of the film she is luminous and you know what,0.047154203
I enjoyed the most about her performance not the singing watching her character think that,0.0704649
was really cool particularly in the early stages of her relationship with Cooper when I,0.041854687
guess the focus was a little bit more on her to some degree but she,0.06444565
was trying to figure out the enigmatic celebrity sitting across from her why is he,0.029707102
talking to me what does he want right we'll talk about that at the end,0.0366749
but then also the added layer of difficulty that she's dealing with somebody who's drunk,0.082715586
you know and also not only that that's tough to do but how she feels,0.033933677
about it you know that's a that's a lot to take on and it's a,0.02915234
risky road to go down but I think to her character's credit she goes down,0.05597986
it with her eyes wide open so I thought that was all great and that,0.07014362
all came from Lady Gaga's performance also I have to add when her character starts,0.029162316
to mimic Gaga's actual music career and those of her peers in the music business,0.038971778
you know in this I'd say maybe the second half of the movie right you,0.04734378
can tell that the commentary which is not flattering uh-huh skirts a little too close,0.061181597
to home for gaga and I think she's made a little uncomfortable by being asked,0.07865331
to to be the face of that commentary right and I think she isn't quite,0.09569066
sure how to play it either which makes the second half of the movie not,0.02222179
not as strong for her as the first that is for the music I'm not,0.040616114
a big music person but I will say that I was impressed because you know,0.04431387
get a more into story and and movie movie making and stuff like that so,0.03208713
impressed me the most music wise was Cooper's ability to capture the feeling of being,0.023884084
in a concert right both in the audience and also backstage and not just backstage,0.020757722
from having VIP access that was done very well you were like oh let's go,0.046528265
this is gonna be so great like when she goes to his first concert he,0.05201869
invites her there's like almost like a Cinderella type feel to it it was really,0.027400244
really cool and then after that sound design as I said the press screening was,0.013522518
an Adobe Atmos theater and for some moments my seat actually throbbed from the music,0.04121478
it was really cool you felt like you not only were at a concert but,0.06785738
you had want the best seat in the house as for the actual singing though,0.02032003
I like shallow quite a bit I don't see how anyone could not like shallow,0.08778296
it's a very good song and also Gaga's chabuk charming performance at the drag bar,0.033718824
and also the scene that follows that backstage between her and Cooper that kind of,0.043151792
like makes for a great package but otherwise I thought the music wasn't particularly distinct,0.037858926
it's not like greatest showmen like for me at least I wouldn't I wasn't like,0.13455468
I must buy the soundtrack I was like I'm are they so I mean they,0.026229521
also don't seem particularly original you know so you're like is this like a song,0.06761858
someone else's song I don't know uh although there's also I have to say one,0.0328175
song that she sings that's supposed to be bad and oh boy is it a,0.10621453
stinker it was awful and like and I think that's part of why she was,0.34435555
like uh you know I have to see these people in the music business Bradley,0.1364418
when I go back you know I'm still kind of in both I have a,0.02174818
foot in both places so they're gonna be like with the creature you saying something,0.10184893
about me when you did that performance right like I don't know it was it,0.06411173
was awkward okay but I have to say also as impressive as Cooper's acting is,0.02997251
I dare say his directing is even more impressive he not only does the story,0.051616922
justice but it's able to package it in a way that indeed elevates it to,0.030486032
awards caliber material I mean oh I've always said to you that you know directors,0.05861798
they have a responsibility to present something as awards worthy like this is special pay,0.018289225
attention this is a film for the ages and I think Cooper very much does,0.029510207
that maybe that's why you made it too long I think someone should have been,0.026898697
like perfect it's a real challenge though at the awards situation though because this is,0.025839724
the fourth telling of the story and the three previous ones were all major awards,0.022497175
contenders but despite a slew of nominations no version is ever won a major Oscar,0.023243513
one of the major categories I think the highest has ever gone is screenplay and,0.022469237
while I feel that shallow is a shoo-in for Best Original Song I'll certainly be,0.044785485
nominated so Gaga and Perkin sing at the Oscars right but I'm curious to see,0.027731506
if Cooper's version can go beyond nominations and finally bring home some gold in a,0.018000534
meaningful way it's certainly his intention to either get director or actor right now though,0.019930897
I don't think think we have a good enough feel for the playing field so,0.017872155
we'll have to wait and see how it shapes up finally and I this is,0.01655243
this is tough but it was struck me so much while watching the movie I,0.063068725
wanted to discuss it here I have I have to comment on the me2 aspect,0.059596464
to the film which haha which highlights why the me2 movement has sent the entertainment,0.027992258
business particularly hard and that's because there's often absolutely no line between professional and personal,0.049544208
and it's a bit uncomfortable especially because of what's what's being discussed and what's happening,0.026182294
today right to watch their first night together as under the circumstances a very different,0.023974549
movie could easily have her claim years later that she wasn't willing to sleep with,0.062224604
him he wouldn't have helped her career and that's the case that's clearly the case,0.025997372
that would be a correct accusation in this situation and I'm not saying the Cooper's,0.0174032
character is vilified here by any means that just happens to be his motivation if,0.015059758
he didn't think she was hot he would not have helped her if he wasn't,0.12156231
interested in her physically you know and you know it turns out here fortunately there,0.12907556
was a romantic aspect to it as well but there often isn't right but I,0.030714855
think because of that the scene actually does an amazing job of showing how grey,0.11315705
perhaps too gray the entertainment entertainment business is instead of black and white when it,0.03751636
comes to professional versus personal it's like I would say that this is like again,0.033366278
has a Cinderella type quality to it points but like 99% of the time it,0.021001844
doesn't turn out like this so I would I would hate to think that this,0.041254688
would kind of romanticize something that it should not so just make sure that you,0.08948716
know just like Lady Gaga's character goes into the relationship with her eyes open you,0.044128284
know make sure that you're really aware of what's going on in someone's intentions it's,0.044694353
it's complicated but that's good I think I think the movie is it's complex but,0.023552822
I think there might have to be some commentary on that and if there's if,0.025134629
there's anything that could potentially undercut this for award season it might be that the,0.010619657
potential romanticizing of that aspect but anyway that's my review of a star is born,0.041499477
I'm very curious to hear your thoughts down below save those spoiler comments though for,0.029443024
the spoiler review you know those are for those who aren't familiar with the star,0.025559682
is born' story you don't want to ruin it for them right and then of,0.06208159
