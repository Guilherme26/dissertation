hey everybody today I'm reviewing spotlight which is directed by thomas mccarthy,0.122175835
this is his fifth film i believe this film has an incredibly talented cast that has enough sophistication to be able to act in a very understated manner nobody here is really being showy with their acting which to me really matches the very minimalistic and understated style of the film you have,0.13800749
Michael Keaton Mark Ruffalo Rachel McAdams Liev Schreiber stanley tucci and the list goes on and this film is based on true events that happened in Boston in the early 2000s 2001 actually and basically it's about the investigative journalism unit in the Boston Globe and they come across a story about allegations made against the Catholic Church and a few priests in the area were accused of molesting 80 or more boys throughout the years and of course nowadays it's more common knowledge,0.13419126
but at the time it was considered quite shocking,0.045426473
it was scandalous especially because Americans didn't know how to deal,0.25147754
with this kind of information because you know the church is deeply embedded in the ideologies of American culture and it's hugely fundamental in terms of how the country was built in the first place just like many of the corporations that have been built over the decades over the centuries religion and and the church has become a dominant conglomerate in its own right,0.10613532
that's the dilemma of the film,0.06913299
and it's not only just an overall dilemma,0.098729946
but it's also a lot of internal conflict with the actual characters the main characters themselves,0.057442855
because many of them were raised Catholic as children it's about lifting that veil so to speak on this puritanical society whatever that means and something that people thought that they knew and that they trusted and revealing this dark underbelly of society that you know so many terrible things are happening that people do not acknowledge,0.24284913
I loved this movie I thought it was a wonderful piece of filmmaking,0.1656263
it works on so many different levels,0.096630864
it works as a great investigative piece it works as a social commentary and it's also a very grippy suspenseful piece of filmmaking and it never over does a single aspect of what it's trying to convey this film is extremely reminiscent of a lot of those very minimalistic raw 1970s films like All the President's Men that's the easiest comparison i can make because they both are very very similar,0.17037873
and then of course i felt like as i was watching this movie I was watching this great Sidney Lumet films like Dog Day Afternoon Serpico spotlight works right along with those films almost perfectly because there's almost no fat to trim here I mean they get right down to it,0.2268164
it's very direct,0.06879016
there's nothing at all that is superfluous,0.13480502
and it's not a glamorous Hollywood movie in the slightest everything feels very very real the office settings are very bland and ordinary and the wardrobes of the characters feel just very mundane and they don't draw attention to themselves not in a boring way but they're just trying to capture the details every little thing that makes you feel like you are living in this world,0.114560425
every single tints in immediate moment that these journalists are feeling you feel like you're right along with them in this movie really celebrates professionalism and it celebrates what investigative journalism can be so you don't see much about what's going on in the characters lives other than what's in their professional lives,0.09891984
but the film always just gives very subtle hints of what's going on in these characters personal lives,0.07231771
so that you are able to build enough sympathy as a viewer and they are never overt about it,0.15967356
it's always just kind of a little thing here or there you know in a lesser film probably a lot of the characters would have you know pause the rest of the film and gone into this very wordy anecdote and that just would have really detracted,0.09867965
I think as these characters are discovering all of these really troubling facts about all these priests and as the facts start to build and build,0.15069549
and they find more and more information you just get sucked into it right along with them,0.790093
one thing that really makes the movie work is that it really does pay attention to the time period,0.055699863
it takes that time period of 2001 and makes it a major focal point which is something that raises the stakes 2001 was a major turning point not just for Americans but for the entire world I mean it was the start of a new millennium and of course 911 happens right in the middle of when these journalists are trying to gather all this information on the church and priorities start to shift very in a very different direction,0.08138394
and the world becomes a lot darker and a lot more cynical as a result also we start to see the internet becoming a lot more prominent a lot more relevant as the 2000 start to progress,0.18693088
so the old world of the newspaper and journalism is starting to die out and these characters at the Boston Globe,0.18215828
they're not only trying to expose a very dark scandal,0.1507427
but they're also trying to save themselves and try to gather those readers that they might be losing so that they can continue doing important journalism,0.094937794
a lot of the characters you can see as they're trying to find out more information on this story,0.042818677
they are constantly going through,0.061502226
you know physical archives books and and pages and pages of information and there's very little digital work going on in terms of the internet and not only does that show you how much times have changed since then but I think that's very deliberate,0.059757426
on the part of the director because you're seeing all of these characters teetering right on the edge of the old world and this breakthrough into the digital world and now we live in a time where nothing is secretive almost anything you can find just by the click of a button,0.09371958
it's easier to find stories and to discuss them and to expose the system for what it truly is these journalists are right on the cusp of that and it's almost as if they're introducing symbolically the world in in the story at least to a different world we're digging for stories and having to go do all this underground work is going to start becoming far more mainstream,0.058195148
that's just one reason why I think that they'll have,0.062156294
so many great ideas going on and they're pulled off in the most effort list of ways,0.116158925
and the drama comes from underneath which is very rare in a Hollywood film there are a few things here,0.069248624
and there that I would change just to give the film more polish more sophistication,0.061443996
one big thing for me was the score by Howard sure I just I felt like it came off as very kind of cookie cutter detective music I thought that the film deserved a lot more,0.11377176
I wish they were able to get somebody like David Shire you should look up his music for another 1970s film that this film reminds me of the conversation he did that score,0.07242403
and he also did zodiac that would have been the perfect way to enhance it for me,0.087157376
but I mean I'm nitpicking what's more important is the power that this film has just a story and as something that is a social commentary it's very relevant and it needs to be told,0.05614579
and you should absolutely see it,0.06795152
it is very entertaining,0.09556326
it is well made,0.041648943
it's it's a really really great film,0.06583047
i'm so glad that i saw it,0.099601895
so that is my review,0.0786987
