summary you're still going to find plenty of surprises in there and you're going to,0.021718912
enjoy the hell out of it one of my favorite things about parasite is how,0.2267147
masterfully bong joon-ho handles these genre shifts that happen throughout the film you have satire,0.058440376
and black comedy you have a family drama you have suspense that crosses over into,0.22630878
thriller territory and all of it is flavored with really well-done social commentary the film,0.048344217
has this beautiful flow to it that is very reminiscent of a stage performance and,0.051128674
it made so much sense when I was watching and reading interviews with bong joon-ho,0.086487174
afterwards and hearing him talk about how important the rhythm of the film is to,0.0228005
him and how what parasite in particular he started off with an idea of it,0.24789597
being a stage play the pacing is exactly what it needs to be as well,0.02216525
the beginning shows us all we need to know about the two families one after,0.015249335
the other and as the film goes along it keeps ramping up it keeps winding,0.018754188
the tension like a spring until we get to the culmination where well you're just,0.04440101
going to have to watch and find out how that goes another thing I loved,0.03120576
about this film is that there aren't any heroes or villains here all of the,0.038599275

own faults parasite is not interested in pointing fingers or taking sides instead it shows,0.087109126
the problem of the gap between the rich and the poor it shows a conflict,0.094881795
and the lack of understanding between classes and while every character is looking out for,0.016106756
their own the audience is left wondering if coexistence is possible at all can the,0.011861554
invisible line be crossed is there a solution or is it just that no matter,0.021039093
how the power dynamics shift someone will always end up being a host and someone,0.041528746
else a parasite the film relies on this delicate balance of characters and ideas which,0.18669643
could have easily fallen apart in the hands of a less skilled director or came,0.037141193
off heavy-handed with a less masterful script but parasite maintains this balance perfectly from beginning,0.14334641
to end while also shifting genres and keeping the audience 100% invested in every minute,0.022658816
of its runtime honestly it's amazing this movie even exists of course all of it,0.080457956
is tied together through visuals starting with the architecture which the director had a very,0.018156853
specific vision for he'll they actually ended up building a whole neighborhood just so the,0.0371239
semi basement apartment of the poor family would be exactly what it needed to be,0.08814881
reflecting that in-between status of the family not quite ready to give up on their,0.05579893
situation often throughout the film themes and ideas are represented in a very visual way,0.0070070447
which is something I am a big fan of because visual metaphors are always fun,0.0128473565
however I cannot tell you the details because that would get me into spoilers one,0.075061984
