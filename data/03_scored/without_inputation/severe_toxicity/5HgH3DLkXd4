it's a good week to be an Amy Adams farm arrival is the latest film,0.0444489
by Denis Villeneuve who previously directed prisoners a very good film and Sicario an even,0.029459653
better film in my mind and the rather overlooked enemy which is also a very,0.028333498
good film starring Jake Gyllenhaal who appeared this week in another film with Amy Adams,0.00836535
who stars in this film a very good film itself that film is nocturnal animals,0.052574784
check it out if you haven't seen it but a rival as I say another,0.034816377
very good film starring Amy Adams Adams plays the character of Louise banks who is,0.0062793335
an expert in linguistics and she's drafted in by the military when twelve alien spacecraft,0.05287146
land on earth at various different places around the planet she's given the task of,0.0866282
basically trying to decipher the language that is spoken by these alien creatures and find,0.092741236
out the answer to the question why are they here her character also seems to,0.021255279
have this tragic past in which she was divorced from her husband and then her,0.022041526
child contracted some kind of rare disease which eventually took that child's life I'm just,0.26479152
going to say a few things about this film what I thought about it and,0.07347619
then towards the end I'm not just gonna do spoilers I'm gonna feel like this,0.038555376
is the kind of film I need to in order to fully get to grips,0.029196905
with the themes and what what it's actually all about but don't worry I won't,0.0149766095
go straight into them I will let you know when I'm gonna do spoilers so,0.3195084
you can turn off if you need to as I say right off the bat,0.18582836
denis villeneuve killing it once more Sicario was in the top ten of last year,0.24600491
prisoners as well as really great film and I'm really looking forward to his take,0.050018486
on Blade Runner but this is equally a great film to film about ideas and,0.021754166
it's a film about humanity and pain loss and love basically and beautiful moments kind,0.07014162
of mixed in with painful moments and how yeah you got to take the rough,0.13862094
with the smooth it's a very slow-moving film it takes a while to kind of,0.06801636
get to where it's going to there's a moment when they first get into the,0.02976963
ship when Amy Adams character and character played by Jeremy he was a scientist who,0.009201486
they team up with her to basically go in the ship and make contact with,0.019279683
these aliens and that whole scene where they're getting inside the ship it does take,0.15128006
a while and I got to say it's a little laborious that is really my,0.03250553
only kind of down on the film it's just it's just those moments it takes,0.07656397
a while to get going but once you get into it this is a film,0.036517918
about ideas as I say in about humanity because these alien ships have London to,0.14195684
all these different places around the world different countries are dealing with them in their,0.06689286
own unique way so you've got like China whose are prepared to go to war,0.21526007
and then you've got four other countries who are like kind of following suit with,0.016020283
them they're they're prepared to follow China's lead and then you've got other countries who,0.03985248
are trying to do it in a peaceful manner trying to get to grips with,0.019122034
what's going on and then you've got other countries that are too busy thinking about,0.041871317
what other countries are doing so that's causing a lot of political kind of strife,0.10081656
so yeah it's it's a very good film that deals with what would actually be,0.030611087
the effects of aliens coming down to earth while we have all that while we,0.17041074
have that kind of global scale about the film it's a very big picture story,0.023057926
it is also a very intimate film and he's really all about this character played,0.04943645
by Amy Adams so we we kind of follow her personal story we see these,0.019371478
flashbacks that she has to her child to losing her child to losing her husband,0.17968006
and it grounds that film it grounds it in a very personal intimate story this,0.034818374
is a much warmer performance here by Adams than the previous week's film nocturnal animals,0.03687911
like I said with that film she had a bit of an uphill struggle because,0.042933613
the character wasn't a very easy character to like on the page but she did,0.024994941
very well with it to actually make us sympathize with her here however right off,0.064880684
the bat we sympathize with her you know when you start a film with your,0.14407878
main character losing their child that's it you're on their side so yeah she's definitely,0.045577053
a much easier character to like here and her performance as always with Adams is,0.012699021
absolutely spot-on jeremy renner also offers typically brilliant support is an actor who I don't,0.022537753
often think of and I'm thinking of really great actors but then when I look,0.038664464
at his career when I look at some of the films he's done he is,0.02948227
actually a really great solid actor he does a very good job of showing this,0.03941213
man who's falling for this woman that he's working with but because he respects her,0.12884408
and it's not like an overblown kind of look story we don't get into the,0.030623725
typical romance tropes that you get in other films there's just a lot of subtle,0.0996352
moments that kind of builds this relationship of respect between the two film does a,0.008053378
really good job of holding the mystery of keeping you guessing it's one of them,0.033747427
films where you kind of get 2/3 of the way through of it and then,0.06279533
you start to kind of panic because you like if it just keeps on going,0.090315975
this way and then just suddenly ends if it's one of those films where it's,0.07403693
gonna demand a second watch and a third watch and fourth watch just to start,0.03374543
to get to grips with it then yeah duck that was kind of worrying me,0.09104901
because I just wasn't in a stayer mind to be honest but it does tie,0.04661474
everything together in the in the last five minutes boom Eureka it all ties together,0.042992815
and you understand the ending I think if you're not paying attention then it might,0.042746697
escape you you might go away from yeah you are paying attention then definitely it's,0.0373188
a film you will understand it's easy enough to understand I think so if you're,0.07120924
put off by that kind of film by the likes Twin Peaks you're kind of,0.075017415
David Lynch type stuff that is really hard to penetrate don't worry I don't think,0.23749548
this is that kind of film I think it does hold mystery throughout but it's,0.02467166
all tied up towards the end ultimately it just feels very real and I think,0.044738255
that's the best way to play sci fi for me personally is is when you,0.026757678
can when you can ground it when you can kind of know land ice hit,0.05589405
so to speak it just makes it more personal it makes it more relatable it,0.022886973
doesn't feel so high concept so out there like I said I did want to,0.019196535
go into spoilers and I'm gonna do that now so if you've not seen the,0.06304744
film and you don't want it spoil in go away come back later there's a,0.08026971
line in the film when Jeremy Renner's character is on a conversation with Amy Adams,0.012614543
is character and they're talking about language obviously this character Louise played by Adams she,0.015941126
is a linguistics expert and she talks about her and Rena talks about how when,0.039904367
you learn another language and you start to speak that language it changes your whole,0.041545376
perception of the world it can completely reorient ate you into a different way of,0.20365994
thinking because I did not because you're getting into touch with the way a particular,0.050301854
culture speaks I guess that is deliberately set up so that we understand the payoff,0.04194914
which is that as the film goes on we start to learn that these flashbacks,0.042954233
that Amy Adams character is having that Louise is having and not flashbacks at all,0.031019509
they are flash forwards so she didn't lose her daughter she didn't get divorced she,0.0339237
is going to lose her daughter and she is going to get divorced so by,0.1272044
getting to grips with this alien language by being able to speak it that is,0.051747296
how she is able to see into the future she's able to look at time,0.036102843
not as linear but as nonlinear so she's able to see moments from all over,0.028728617
the place and know what's coming know what's gonna happen so we learn at the,0.036675565
end of the film that obviously this character played by Rena is the guy who,0.031654093
becomes her husband he's the one she's gonna have this child with and he leaves,0.16267465
her from what we can tell from the film because she knows what's happening she's,0.019673472
seen it she knows that this child that they have they're gonna lose and he,0.079964384
can't take that he really can't deal with it and he leaves they they get,0.023922
a divorce Villeneuve is definitely that we say preoccupied with the darker side of humanity,0.11157391
so I would say that this is his most hopeful film now I've not seen,0.021808045
in Sundays I still need to see that film but from the ones I've seen,0.015245344
this is his most hopeful I think because as much as it has its darker,0.046974603
elements this whole idea that Louise can see her future she knows what's gonna happen,0.050506063
it's also filled with hope it's also filled with beauty because she essentially makes the,0.033581797
choice at the end they're actually all that pain that I know I'm gonna suffer,0.20358013
is worth it because of the moments of beauty I'm gonna get with my child,0.15573679
with my unborn child is it worth it that that's the thing if if you,0.1414207
know your future if you could wipe out the painful moments from your future and,0.2543264
in order to do so you would have to wipe out a lot of the,0.28328922
beautiful moments and that's the trade-off can you take the rough with the smooth but,0.036825895
there you go a really great film once again by Denis Villeneuve I don't think,0.044719633
it's his best but when you're dealing with someone like Villeneuve that's not really a,0.036716808
diss on the film because he's put out some pretty fantastic work I still think,0.071475975
Sicario is his best I'd probably put this second I don't know enemy's still pretty,0.12491018
good as well but yeah I would give this a 4 out of 5 I'm,0.034706622
still torn I'm I don't have to give it a 4 in half or a,0.021166809
4 I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 if you've seen a rival,0.050870586
