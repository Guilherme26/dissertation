we're talking about spider-man into the spider verse and I'm gonna tell you why I loved it,0.122876756
and why I think it's one of the best feature links spider-man movies we've ever gotten so stick around,0.112518355
now unlike the spider-man films of the past,0.10176205
this,0.05212481
one focuses on Miles Morales another normal kid that much like Peter Parker gets a spider bite that transforms him into the very same hero that he knows from the comics Morales has a lot of trouble coming to terms with his abilities,0.24077584
and he absolutely thinks he's alone until other versions of the hero from different dimensions including the famous Peter Parker arrived in to his world and they're gonna need more,0.05239362
alice's helps you stop a threat to not only the dimension that morales knows his home,0.14348468
but the entire multiverse growing up spider-man was one of my favorite heroes,0.117372476
but for the most part his live adaptations other than Rama's first two films,0.13085206
and the most recent homecoming just haven't really connected to me that much spider-man was one of the few comics I was able to get my hands on and read as a kid,0.12446788
and unlike other heroes,0.10278733
the webslinger can very easily bring back that childhood nostalgia,0.10346701
Morales was a version of the story unfamiliar to me but regardless I felt like a kid again watching this movie because it just captured that Spiderman atmosphere that I remember growing up,0.071532175
I thought it was an awesome blend of modern and retro it was pulled off from a combination of elements,0.1083062
but I think first and foremost the animation style was fantastic,0.10788462
and it was perfectly selected for this story,0.048853893
it has like a London Street Art vibe to it that I thought complemented the overall mood of the film very effectively but it also has a blend of like pencil art,0.056371924
and watercolor that make it look like just storyboards pulled from the comic book pages itself it wasn't as vibrant as you would expect from today's animated films but it still had plenty of rich depth to it that I found to be more than immersive enough but to me is equally impressive as the artistic appeal was I think the writing of both the storyline itself and the dialogue was also excellent it was down-to-earth and blended with just enough self-awareness historical away it was a - with some nice,0.08194795
meta it created an appealing range of personalities and character types that really grabbed on to me to make me invest into this storyline the humor was very sharp it was,0.06555831
witty and I went in expecting a superhero adventure and not only did I get a great,0.0864027
one but I also got a great comedy as well I think the cast of voice talent was fantastic from top to bottom they all brought life and emotion and warmth to the characters by providing a ton of charisma through their vocal,0.07954868
work I think this added with some already great dialog combined with a simplistic but very warm,0.15160984
art design just pumped a ton of life and charisma into this film to create characters I genuinely cared about in a story that maintained my intrigue because of its freshness,0.13078171
I don't always get pulled into animated films despite thoroughly enjoying them but this was the first one that I can remember in many years that completely consumed me and made me feel like a kid again I appreciated how this movie explored the world of spider-man in a very fun creative way that peeled back layers to the universe,0.1058088
I had never been able to experience before it created a blend of characters that had me wanting to see more of them which is definitely a positive for an animated film,0.10554865
that's hovering at just under two hours,0.08499103
and I know what's gonna sound like it's cliche and a little bit exaggerated but this was an animated movie that truly felt like it was pulled from the pages of a comic book,0.12603728
I loved how this film embraced new avenues in the spider-man universe it introduces the world to Miles Morales and it creates a backdrop and a personality for him that I think can connect to people as strongly as Peter Parker has over the years in my opinion and I love the doors that this opens to exploring new characters in this multiverse,0.07078382
and while this doesn't really directly set up any sequels,0.08368007
it definitely lays the groundwork to many more stories that can be told but I do wish ahead,0.048245803
maybe focused a little bit more on Morales the first half of the film lets us really get to know him I enjoyed what was there,0.06640001
and I just really wanted to see a lot more of that,0.04675379
and as things continue in the plot begins to evolve the focus begins to shift to a lot of the other moving pieces and while I did enjoy where the story goes and how it comes back to Morales,0.0523975
I just honestly wanted to see more of him,0.08860292
but that's not to say that this wasn't an entertaining story because it absolutely as I loved it the action sequences were amazing and adrenaline pumping the musical score was fantastic as well it heightened every scene like it needed to and it only added to just the overall mood and atmosphere of the story the attempts at humor,0.053324386
were very effective,0.043470457
the cast pumped a ton of life into the film with their voiceovers and the hype for this film being extremely high is warranted and to me spider-man into the spider-verse is gonna get 95% on the entertainment meter,0.11100968
I went into this one hoping for a good spider-man movie,0.11351848
and I walked out knowing I had just seen not only a great movie,0.061873663
but honestly my pick for the best animated movie of the year if you're a fan of spider-man,0.15288977
and think you have seen it all this,0.06600846
one probably will prove you wrong it will sweep you up,0.25036278
