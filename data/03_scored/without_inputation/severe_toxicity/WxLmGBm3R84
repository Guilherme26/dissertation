it's very sad and very scary that when it comes to hatred in America so,0.16135758
little has changed since the 1970s when this film takes place I mean on top,0.03837511
of black Klansmen intentionally and powerfully driving home its point with actual footage of Charlottesville,0.0480083
in 2017 in that whole situation including footage of President Trump at the end of,0.03241041
the film black Klansmen also inadvertently draws amazing parallels considering that it couldn't have known,0.001651234
this was going to happen between the hate speech film The Birth of a Nation,0.11363865
which was allowed at the time to become a national mainstream blockbuster and this movie,0.022716686
even points out that a plate at the White House it contrasts that again inadvertently,0.040925425
with the story this week that several digital distributors have decided to stop carrying Infowars,0.020475017
because they feel it qualifies as hate speech and the contrast between stepping in and,0.049456403
stopping something and not stepping in and stopping it and what it does to society,0.047919165
as a whole it's really interesting stuff and by the way I've never actually seen,0.031302214
the birth of a nation of course I'm familiar with it but they show chunks,0.08551136
significant chunks of the movie here and it is something something truly awful and shocking,0.07276644
to see now our this month it was James Baldwin's birthday which was promoted very,0.035349853
heavily this year because moonlights Barry Jenkins has his own Oscar contender coming up which,0.037709925
is based on Baldwin's novel so there there was a an incentivized push to celebrate,0.054118678
Baldwin's birthday and to get his name out there that I think that that film,0.08066017
will probably be more Oscar friendly for the reasons I'm about to outline but there,0.017351981
was an amazing quote from Baldwin which I came across that day which was I,0.04554579
imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they,0.0945359
sense once hate is gone they will be forced to deal with pain and that,0.0803901
is an amazing very astute quote and a nuance that I think this movie misses,0.03877289
it's KKK members are as much caricatures as the disgusting characters and the caricatures and,0.25867453
the birth of a nation rather than really exploring what creates a hate so great,0.21746649
that someone couldn't stand even be touched by someone of a different race or religion,0.30242828
and would actually take great joy in their torture and death and so in a,0.5651069
lot of ways black clansmen is I would say preaching to the choir and breaks,0.06360087
little new ground and exploring something that's been a dirty horrifying secret in America since,0.3905918
its inception I mean I guess it explores it and explores it in new ways,0.07811517
but it doesn't break new ground it's like it's a it's a different way to,0.028805112
have a discussion we've already been having to me the most unique thing about black,0.1331292
Klansmen is that while it juxtaposes very effectively white and black power extremist groups at,0.09317028
the heart of the story is a black moderate wrong Stallworth and the white moderates,0.06537225
who work with him at the Colorado Springs Police Department which with the exception of,0.011884171
one or two unsavory characters seems like an amazing place to work like these are,0.100538515
a great group of guys and that moderate viewpoint unusual for Hollywood I think will,0.03653388
be a welcome change for many and perhaps maybe we'll get a couple of people,0.01659234
outside of the choir to watch and consider this film now I could watch this,0.022699391
film all day long thanks to John David Washington's Ron Stallworth I mean the promotion,0.03174123
for this movie has not done his performance justice it is something worthy of a,0.037990633
Coen Brothers movie the movie itself is not though side note this whole thing Spike,0.048822485
Lee borrows heavily from the Coen brothers but he never turns it up to an,0.033583127
11 an absurdity shock value or high art as the Coen brothers do so well,0.093876705
where you're like damn that is weird and crazy beautiful and this comes close a,0.27356538
couple of times I think that Spike Lee felt the absurdity of the situation would,0.10185491
do that but again this is a conversation we've been having very intently for the,0.015909862
you know the past couple of years now again and so I think that that,0.0153737245
those qualities aren't quite there the way that maybe he had hoped but could have,0.0352993
been if I think he'd been a little bit bolder from an artistic perspective but,0.073403016
I also think it's great that while John David washing denzel's son he is very,0.056786727
much his own actor and doesn't try to capitalize on any of his father's signature,0.0897213
moves they say you would never guess they were related but they are both very,0.018851304
talented and while I didn't think much of him as an actor before this movie,0.050540652
I'd seen him on like one or two episodes of ballers and I wasn't impressed,0.044745572
with the whole thing quite frankly but now I think he should be on every,0.039926317
casting shortlist and I'm very excited to see him again shortly and Robert Redford's the,0.07422718
old man in the gun where he plays another police officer actually our detective I,0.15929219
think in that film now the rest of the cast does a very nice job,0.024370333
in addition with a few standouts and then also a couple people who sucked but,0.46769384
let's talk about the good people first so Adam driver gives an understated but powerful,0.03252615
performance as a jewish detective who has to come to terms with having past you,0.22594558
know past most of his life and coming you know something that he hadn't even,0.06504033
considered laura hair is very likable as an unwavering member of the Black Power movement,0.068015024
even to a fault which I thought was very brave of the movie to also,0.047232028
explore Corey Hawkins anchors a very compelling and moving sequence of a rally where he,0.032647215
speaks as a black panther member Kwame Toure the way like Spike Lee that was,0.094424814
really great like the way he would focus on black faces in the crowd being,0.19161479
moved by the words of Kwame Toure that was pretty neat stuff there was one,0.05438475
of the better I think maybe more artistic moments of the movie and then Harry,0.034833673
Belafonte has an unforgettable scene where you actually believe he lives he lived the story,0.040285517
he's telling and finally in the good category Ken ggarrido plays the best police boss,0.28251934
you could ever ask for such a sweetheart but like he still seemed like a,0.030102221
realistic member of the police department I loved him I was like that guy so,0.2240196
great and as for the actors who didn't quite work out Alec Baldwin practically embarrassed,0.0709598
himself I feel he did embarrass himself and a small supposedly comedic cameo at the,0.10865575
beginning of the film that's just a mess it does Network I even feel maybe,0.044319857
it should've been cut Nicholas Turturro I know he's a spike Lee favorite but he,0.09428712
is the least convincing KKK I've ever seen I'd be like that guy wouldn't be,0.119520865
welcomed by the KKK what and then while Paul Walter Hauser is very funny as,0.11594483
another KKK member interestingly building off his eye Tania performance last year he stands out,0.40505934
in both movies but he Jasper poq Onan and Ashley Atkinson are also clownish in,0.23338431
their performances and not I would say in an effective way so while I found,0.05000119
black Klansmen extremely entertaining and powerful featuring some stellar performances I think it's just shy,0.055052593
of greatness so I don't see it going the distance in terms of awards season,0.009839397
I can maybe see it getting some nominations it's because of the subject matter Spike,0.055013347
Lee you know Jason Blum Perdue Jason Blum and Jordan Peele producing behind the scenes,0.028731942
it's an attractive package but it just you know again as I said it doesn't,0.03742456
go the distance it's just shy of greatness as an awards film is like a,0.04350301
film for the for the ages but as a piece of entertainment and a way,0.06003615
to spend two-plus hours of your time it's great I would actually put it along,0.10944865
the lines of like really great television you know like along like better call Saul,0.035145644
or something or Breaking Bad or something like that or Fargo you know based of,0.08496391
course on the Coen brothers work it has that quality to it but for a,0.016364183
movie and even I think even for us to tell standout television show again just,0.018243993
misses the mark just misses it it certainly gave me a lot to think about,0.037635427
though maybe and hopefully you know again preaching to the choir but I hope it,0.035559386
reaches a couple of people as well so anyway that's my review of black Klansmen,0.2835306
I'd be very curious to hear your thoughts down below don't put any spoilers in,0.07469081
or at least if you have a spoiler market is such because I think there,0.01459679
are a couple of interesting twists and turns in the film now I guess finally,0.013364204
you might be like why don't you mention Topher Grace grace and actually when I,0.086964116
was at the press screening someone said another member of the press was like oh,0.024309801
I heard people saying Topher Grace should get nominated for an Oscar like maybe just,0.027068984
because he was willing to play David Duke but I don't think that's fair cuz,0.052035987
I don't think his per he's just Topher Grace and a wig and he's like,0.08063356
oh a mustache like he's it's hair acting right like he he said he did,0.24840477
a lot of research for the role but I didn't see it I think that,0.0076329825
he's actually one of the least effective like he like Topher Grace talking about this,0.06923165
character said he was surprised looking at old footage of David Duke how effective he,0.039591067
was and maybe making people think what he was saying wasn't horrible so I didn't,0.055890724
see that with Topher Grace I just saw Topher Grace so I think that another,0.026735727
actor maybe would have been able to get that disturbing quality across that gray zone,0.10971539
if you will all right so write your thoughts down below and of course as,0.100859135
