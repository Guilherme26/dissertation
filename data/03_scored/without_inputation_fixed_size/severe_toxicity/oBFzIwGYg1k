hey guys Sam back here again and this week on our in this edition of,0.019421367
the criterion collection review we're going to be looking at a film that sort of,0.024273217
kick-started Alfred Hitchcock's period in America and it's also a part of a trilogy I've,0.16163297
sort of coined specifically for this review series which is three films I'm reviewing in,0.034566935
a row both starting with the letter R last one was for Fifi of the,0.011240273
one we'll be doing next time is Rashomon but right now we're going to be,0.023848165
talking about the haunting Gothic romance Rebecca which is actually going to be number 135,0.047339123
in the collection but this is the most recent transfer by criterion released a year,0.016163297
or two ago I believe now Rebecca I actually saw back in high school because,0.025219772
one of my teachers who was also a big film nerd actually lent me a,0.2824057
copy or her copy of it and I immediately fell in love with the movie,0.046601437
and when I saw criterium was releasing it I believe that was around the time,0.023552822
they had a sale I had to pick it up it's it's just such a,0.037114587
fantastic movie and rewatching it and I think this was the first time I've watched,0.05804725
the movie for about two or three years and there were a lot of things,0.0263885
about it I had forgotten and I sort of rediscovered my love for the film,0.048217166
so I'm very excited to talk about it quite honestly but to get into the,0.03184367
plot Rebecca follows on this love story or this this is the relationship between a,0.019766597
young woman played by Joan Fontaine who actually has no name within the film she,0.035008617
isn't she isn't called by name and this often referred to as mrs. Dewinter as,0.029806213
she does eventually become the wife of the widower maximilian de Wynter played by Laurence,0.07414137
Olivier who they meet while they're both in Morocco I want to say and it,0.04636995
had this whirlwind romance getting married a few weeks later and she's whisked away to,0.09547248
Max's Max's large estate which is referred to as Mandalay which is this sort of,0.010931628
this like almost impossible Gothic mansion this large structure that has a lot of importance,0.088664986
within the town that max lives in and everyone sort of evolved in the goings,0.064805515
on within that within that that mansion one of the most important and most iconic,0.019531121
events that happened there was actually the death of max's previous wife rebecca who one,0.04017044
night went out into the sea and her boat sunk and she drowned with it,0.31708625
and so everyone has been sort of excitedly waiting for max to find new love,0.042589713
and stop being in this depressive slump since the death of rebecca but Joan Fontaine,0.15132995
or mrs. Dewinter moves into Mandalay and soon feels unnerved and unease while living there,0.060707986
not only because of the the servants are the sort of the house maid that,0.051404726
lives there whose name is escaping me who constantly seems to be doubting and questioning,0.043008115
her motives and her actions but even more directly by the memory and almost the,0.043655336
the ghost of Rebecca where Rebecca's initials are on so many different like pillows and,0.03279555
clothes and her side of the house has been closed off and you know this,0.061945226
woman is constantly comparing herself to Rebecca and trying to be like her but there,0.099625885
is definitely a deeper darker secret going on beneath the surface and so it's sort,0.04786462
of a psychological thriller set within the Gothic genre and I think specifically talking about,0.10514225
genre that might be the best place to start Alfred Hitchcock I don't think is,0.036368918
really known for gothic horror he's known for thrillers and more like direct horror like,0.10999543
with things like the birds or with with psycho but I think I kind of,0.09009713
wish Alfred Hitchcock had more of an interest in the genre because as an adaptation,0.03734474
of a gothic novel as a visualization of it Rebecca is a gorgeous looking film,0.042956896
the mansion itself Mandalay is just a bunch of separate sets and rooms put together,0.052725118
but it just feels so grand and massive and kind of daunting you know I,0.022167245
mean the movie begins with with the main character mrs. Dewinter recounting a narration like,0.024868555
I always go back to to Mandalay my dreams we can never return but I,0.07940164
always come back to it you know it has this sort of seductive power that,0.027490044
makes it this irresistible location that is full of mystery and like decadence and the,0.044434268
way that they film the rooms and people within the rooms and the use of,0.06598489
shadows and just it's it's some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a,0.02450337
Hitchcock movie it's there's some very striking imagery and in this movie that really sticks,0.06942854
with me and I think just as an adaptation of a gothic story it does,0.031660747
a fantastic job within the genre tropes and sort of avoid I've had a lot,0.04740165
of gothic novels I took a class at college talking about gothic novels and a,0.013068198
lot of them hint at supernatural elements and then turns out there are supernatural elements,0.032882687
and I I don't know if this is necessarily a spoiler but there is no,0.020755725
supernatural element to Rebecca but there is this this presence right where you are unsure,0.042437386
if there is a ghost if there is a spirit you know like maybe Rebecca,0.021895185
really is haunting this place maybe not as a physical spirit but definitely her memory,0.046525605
and the expectations that come with that are definitely haunting this woman and I think,0.14682266
that's probably one of my favorite aspects of the plot is this is Joan Fontaine's,0.014302114
character dealing with this expectation where she is sort of thrust into this new role,0.040002815
as like the head of a household where she's supposed to take care of the,0.08796655
same duties and pick up almost exactly where Rebecca left off but she's never you,0.0364055
know she's a working-class girl she's never had to deal with high society and sort,0.22429033
of the anxiety and pressure that comes from living up to those expectations it's it's,0.027374968
really engaging at least to me and a big part of that is Joan Fontaine's,0.027123528
performance she is simply incredible in this film she has this ability to appear and,0.04292563
act very like weak and docile and there's a special feature on here that we'll,0.047285244
get to later we're one of the interviewers or commentators discusses how she looks like,0.027159449
a newborn fawn you know where she feels very like angelic and and and and,0.074098796
as if something something that needs to be protected but there does come a point,0.016225824
in the film where she gains more power are they self-confidence and she can play,0.021634433
both very well and she just absolutely kills it Laurence Olivier is good and he's,0.5132625
Laurence Olivier classically trained actor big star at the time and he has a good,0.050540652
job of course but one of the issues with Rebecca and I'm not sure well,0.026093824
I say it's an issue but this might be intentional I don't know but it,0.039240513
feels intentional sometimes is that the romance between Max Max and Joan Fontaine's character doesn't,0.0071008354
really feel genuine and I think part of that is how quickly their romance happens,0.022826442
just how fast they fall in love and get married and then whenever they're together,0.045654215
they're sort of bickering and fighting and they think that's kind of the point um,0.11976565
it doesn't necessarily make for a convincing bromance that I feel like the movie is,0.023502268
trying to get across at the very end but it does make for a compelling,0.035713043
conflict right where you have this woman who is not only anxious about living up,0.25660113
to the widow's you know the previous wife's lifestyle vacations that she said but I,0.022434648
was also just trying to live up to this husband that she barely knows and,0.090433046
slowly learning what type of person he is and he's a very controlling manipulative kind,0.14037903
of person that is very off-putting but does a great job for developing these characters,0.057872307
and this conflict and narrative and so to jump off of that relationship I feel,0.13571543
like Rebecca is just to me is an extremely engaging movie not just visually but,0.043039378
character wise I'm really struck by sort of this these these power plays within their,0.03840305
relationship not only between Max and and an enjoyment Eanes character but also between Joan,0.019737994
Fontaine and Rebecca and how Rebecca despite you know being dead Syl still seems to,0.19042546
have power and domain over this house and over the new wife it's it's simply,0.041569322
incredible and Alfred Hitchcock does or at least the film crew does such an incredible,0.016938902
job making Rebecca's presence felt and there are some amazing sequences in the film where,0.011879515
the camera is sort of like pans around a room and moves around in a,0.06932478
way as if it's as if there is a person in the center of the,0.022901608
frame performing actions that are being described and it does such an incredible job at,0.013857106
like conveying how how ideas and people and memories haunt us I just think I,0.040906135
just think Rebecca is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best and I think it's such an,0.022926886
incredible exploration of like anxiety and like not guilt but like expectation and the and,0.015369068
the toxicity of relationships and how past events can can affect the present and you,0.046731148
know all these different themes and ideas leading to of finality like a final 30,0.029367859
minutes that I originally thought there was a criticism in the finale where we sort,0.052379888
of leave Mandalay for four different plots that going to the town and I thought,0.027566541
like man I really wish we were back at Mandalay wish we were back in,0.08030829
the in the house and I realized that's kind of the point right like that,0.027786052
is what is so like it the movie has achieved conveying to me how important,0.03520418
and like seductive this house is this this this place is how its mystery draws,0.017210962
us in just like the mystery of the plot and I think it's just it's,0.04587306
it's one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies if not my favorite it's the one,0.064760946
he actually won the only movie he won an Oscar for anyone Best Picture for,0.014946011
it which he wasn't even present to accept which that actually kind of segues nicely,0.075824946
into the special features so these special features in Rebecca sort of our mixture are,0.018018495
are one of two things you either have a special feature talking about the film,0.027283173
and the weights and like the way it looks and analyzing the themes and the,0.022781875
ideas or it's a special feature talking about the relationship between alfred hitchcock and producer,0.12515298
David L Selznick who at the time was probably the biggest producer in Hollywood just,0.015299889
coming off with a success of Gone with the Wind and would go on to,0.031265628
make many other successes in that era of 30s 40s era of Hollywood and for,0.024882525
me the most interesting special feature here is the the discussion of a conversation between,0.0149885835
between these two authors Molly Haskell and Patricia white where they speak about Rebecca specifically,0.022977438
in feminist terms and how its representation for her women and dynamics between women and,0.09408158
their relationships and that to me was very enlightening and very fascinating especially being a,0.019517154
guy I think it's important to listen to how women feel about a movie about,0.14186105
women especially with a female main character at a time when women's roles are very,0.1663957
minor are very you know weren't handled well but there's great behind-the-scenes about the production,0.03240309
and specifically the feuds between Alfred Hitchcock and David L Selznick and even the commentary,0.061503544
track is really interesting going into the behind the scenes as well as just commentating,0.081888765
on themes and ideas within the film and then the booklet the booklet written by,0.012710329
if I can find his name written by David Thompson or David Thompson details not,0.015130932
only the themes of the film and the production but it also details the history,0.009576649
of the script and the adaptation and again Alfred Hitchcock and David L Selznick's tensions,0.019471921
onset along with this is probably one of the coolest things I've seen so far,0.020111162
now I'll say that so far is the booklet includes memo notes sent between Alfred,0.013614979
Hitchcock and David Selznick which is super cool that's it that's a really incredible piece,0.025332188
of film history and again showing why criterion is the best at creating these special,0.019382121
features especially for classic and spectacular movies like this so I mean even if you,0.05709404
don't like Rebecca if you watch it it's not your thing I would still recommend,0.10203452
buying this Edition for that piece of film history for the conversations and the special,0.0287958
features all of it makes the purchase worth it in my opinion but yeah highly,0.0391128
recommend Rebecca please go out and watch it also please come back next time we'll,0.0734549
be talking about the third film in our our trilogy which is a character I,0.029725727
was Rashomon probably his most famous and Robbie's most famous film and the film that,0.0062886463
introduced the West to foreign films and Japanese films in general but for now if,0.003568045
