hey there guys John can't be here,0.12534483
thanks for checking out my movie vlog I'm in San Diego in my hotel at the moment in case you can't tell and this is my quick review for the brand new Christopher Nolan film Dunkirk,0.09516953
now Dunkirk is based on the true events,0.08167253
when four hundred thousand soldiers with their back to the sea trapped on a beach completely surrounded by German forces that were coming in and no way to get home and the concerted organized effort to save those guys,0.12280521
now a few months ago there was a lot of conundrum going on because people found out that this was going to be a pg-13 movie and how on earth can you do a true war movie,0.1802325
that's worth anything unless,0.11689262
it's rated R,0.07924966
I mean if it's going to be good it's got lots of blood and guts right or else,0.47125223
it's just going to feel weak like Disney as if there's only one specific formula you can use to make a war movie to make it any good don't get me wrong,0.10680744
there's nothing wrong formula formula is good but sometimes break,0.075300984
in the formula is also good,0.037236173
that's the case with Dunkirk,0.061753396
because believe me this is one of the most intense films you are going to see this year,0.10686213
maybe next year maybe the year after that the way Christopher Nolan sculpts this story is,0.04660143
so impressive,0.0498363
look we heard early on from some early screenings of the film that a lot of critics,0.072099
are coming out saying,0.06920903
you know what there's not a lot of character development in this thing,0.07319301
it's not allowed you know immersive dialogue we don't really get to know the characters very well and that kind of set off some alarms for some people,0.091036506
but what you realize really quickly going into this film is that this movie isn't about any of the characters this movie is about the situation and more than that as a filmmaker,0.057625458
and as an audience this movie was about Christopher Nolan wanting to take the audience and immerse them into a real situation that happened once and let you naturally feel all the intensity all the tension all the fear that that situation would have had it was about taking you plucking you out of that comfortable seat and dropping you into the middle of hell,0.2536439
and when the bullets are whizzing by and when the boats are sinking and when the planes are buzzing overhead you didn't need to see blood to actually feel that terror,0.26074412
you know what this reminds me of and this is going to sound a little weird,0.24168932
but follow me here for a second it reminds me of that horror movie The Descent,0.15268438
I love that horror movie but what was so great about that movie it wasn't the characters or getting to know them or the background whatever the reason I got so sucked into that movie was the first half of the descent when their cave diving and there you can feel the claustrophobic nature,0.2937653
you're in there with them do what they did in that movie was able to take you out,0.15249546
of the comfort of your seat and put you in that cave put you in that type spot make you feel like you couldn't breathe feel how insanely scared you would be down,0.43354383
there because what they did was,0.04234821
they didn't entrench you with the character at that point,0.07144056
they just embedded you into the situation so you could feel it,0.06627605
that's what Dunkirk does the movie is about taking you taking you out of that comfortable seat and put you in the middle that war and making you feel it like honestly no other war movie has ever made me feel it,0.15266792
you know one of the truly incredible things that Christopher Nolan does here you hear me say a lot for me to care about action,0.09964169
I first have to care about the characters,0.057195883
if you get me to care about the characters then the action has dramatic purpose,0.09945047
and yet in Dunkirk,0.052799292
I never really got to care about any of the individual characters,0.07733085
yes,0.036876976
I got to see Tom Hardy's great pilot,0.052007496
yes I got to see,0.055058282
Kenneth Branagh looking very regal in a captain's hat,0.108723156
and yes I got to see a bunch of those things,0.0922481
but I didn't care about the characters instead what Christopher Nolan did was instead of getting you to care about the characters,0.08251562
he got you to care about the situation because like I mentioned before he makes you feel like you're in the situation you're not suddenly but having the need to feel a connection to this one particular guy in order to care about the action because you felt like you were in it,0.12114093
and that was all the motivation,0.06566139
you need to care about the action what's going on,0.06004627
now I'm reading some people saying that Dunkirk is just all non-stop from the beginning of the film to the end of images Moomba all non-stop all non-stop and that's not necessarily true,0.09014976
Christopher Nolan very intelligently throughout the film understands that as an audience member,0.10332471
we need to be able to catch our breath for a minute now and again or else we just get fatigued with what's going on on screen,0.07337878
and there are very deliberate pauses throughout the film that give us that time to catch our breath right before Nolan throws us right back into the fire again the understanding of the preciousness of Hope the pure intensity of the movie having a movie that's really able to teleport you from the comfort of your seat into the situation itself are some of the reasons why Dunkirk is an absolute triumph,0.0805161
now I've been hearing some people saying that this is Christopher Nolan's greatest movie ever and I can see why some people would say that,0.07687012
I don't necessarily,0.059996147
think,0.055016134
so I don't think,0.09522496
it's the Dark Knight,0.047113918
I don't think it's memento necessarily,0.073295005
I don't think it's as good as my favorite,0.11437777
Christopher Nolan film insomnia but it ranks right up there,0.060541857
this is a truly fantastic film and it's a different kind of film,0.07531847
it is truly original how can a World War 2 movie be original and we've seen that thousands of trust me,0.09315784
it's the way that Nolan does the film that is very unique and very original,0.052604098
and I think is going to give you an experience in the movie theater that you haven't had before,0.1249693
but of course the most important thing here is what do you think I know there are lots of advanced fanscreen these across the country for Dunkirk were you one of the lucky people that got to see it are you looking forward to this film what if the reviews done for your expectations,0.046412606
are you nervous about the lack of character development are you excited about the action or you still one of those people who thinks if it's not rated R can't be any good leave your thoughts,0.11973787
