I know the world another worlds car going crazy but I hope you find some,0.25252032
time to find some joy and some love for yourself and for the community this,0.13310927
month now I originally really wanted to start kick off this month on the second,0.3648509
but you know the world was the world had other plans so I took a,0.06304631
week off because we we wasn't doing that so we're back we're a little more,0.092106216
sane and we're excited to talk about moonlight that moonlight is a film directed by,0.07312277
Barry Jenkins they came out in 2016 it's based off of a play by Tarell,0.09971237
Alvin McCraney titled in moonlight black boys look blue all night is a story about,0.027785273
a young black man named shyrone and he's growing up in the 1980s in my,0.40312842
hearing you see three sections of his life where he is a child where he's,0.3493779
a teenager and when he's an adult as with most coming-of-age movies he's kind of,0.25966153
figure out who he is where he fits into the world and where he kind,0.24039645
of fits in with his environment you might have heard of moonlight back in like,0.06533153
2017 during Oscar season because they had a whole fiasco at the Oscars where the,0.098617144
announcer said the wrong title for the award originally they said la-la-land and the Academy,0.059270304
Award for Best Picture la-la-land it was like oh just kidding it's actually moonlight so,0.033892427
they ended up actually winning the award there's a mistake moonlight you guys won Best,0.07869069
Picture this is not a joke moonlight is won Best Picture the Oscars Fiasco aside,0.07351349
let's talk about my thoughts on this movie let me give you a little background,0.11188539
this movie came out in 2016 but at the time I thought oh this looks,0.074663796
interesting but in 2016 I wasn't really in two movies like I am nowadays I,0.07811559
was just like especially Oscar movies cuz I was like hmm this is probably gonna,0.07440664
be some like bougie pretentious hoity-toity kind of movie that I'm just gonna be sitting,0.18232419
here like what was that supposed to mean to me so I kind of just,0.09013717
brushed it off for a little bit and then the word season came around and,0.07447458
it was getting some acclaim but I was like oh I need to go watch,0.07145869
that and then I think I just you know you'd be having the list of,0.08326057
movies that you're like oh I need to go watch this and then at some,0.08367294
point your list gets too long you starts again some that's where I wasn't moonlight,0.12580425
so I attempted to watch the one year my best friend we both I don't,0.07184849
know something happened with the internet it was acting funky we're never watching it so,0.110030666
come bleep me I'm finally like oh I want to finally watch something like oh,0.29147503
oh I can watch it and then review for Pride Month because I knew it,0.07066425
was an LGBTQ story so I was like this would be perfect so I watched,0.118196145
it fell in love I love this movie it's so good like there's like movies,0.09862775
that are good there cuz you know they entertain you and they kind of make,0.10340398
you laugh and they're just like oh well that was you know a fun old,0.25665447
time but this movie is just beautiful like it is a work of art to,0.12073682
me it's it's like it's the epitome of like oh film you know there's like,0.14431053
movies and there's films this to me is like oh film one of the things,0.15083976
I love is that it's such a subtle movie like the main themes of the,0.071494706
movie is not hitting you over the head you're not getting smacked by you every,0.37358347
five seconds you're not sitting here like oh my god okay I get it director,0.23043326
I know what you're trying to say like the story encompasses a boy's life so,0.10616471
it feels realistic everything about it is not you know usually in some movies that,0.06849142
want to hit you with a message they like message take this message and you're,0.56167024
like all right you know I got you I see you but this one it's,0.11990659
like and it's just it's so it's just so subtle that I love it so,0.06331854
much there's a bunch of topics that I just kind of illustrated in the background,0.078638315
or in like a subsection of the fire I guess you want to say that,0.13564913
you don't fully paying attention until you may be watching a couple times or you're,0.1551107
like hmm I would if they were trying to say this about that or if,0.08418416
they were trying to give an example of something like this so like two topics,0.112533696
at least I saw in the movie is the showing of like the school to,0.063172065
Prison Pipeline and masculine in black culture the masculine you want is a little more,0.0890659
shown but the school to Prison Pipeline drugs in neighborhoods living up in a poor,0.2667547
neighborhood all of those kind of combined together and it's just background or like little,0.10514056
pieces of the plot but you're so focused on the characters that you're like oh,0.13041951
wait a minute like they're trying to say they think they just proved that or,0.12972316
they're trying to say that or like oh I love it now speaking of the,0.06105241
movie focusing on its characters this will be such an intimate movie like you're really,0.19122145
up close and personal for a lot of the shots you're really only focusing on,0.20566724
"so much characters like there's not really like 6,000 characters you need to keep track",0.07687337
of and with this person's plotline is it's really a story about Shai Rome so,0.07644231
you only really see things through Sharon's perspectives sometimes you'll get a little glimpse of,0.110280864
somebody else's perspective but for the most part you only see through Shiro is not,0.0617711
much dialogue in here so the actors really got a focus on facial expressions and,0.13401596
body language which I'll talk about the actors later but oh they just do it,0.061775893
so well they tell so much things this movie does a great job of showing,0.077763475
and not telling you know usually if you hear like a story or you watch,0.1015761
a movie the critique is don't tell your audience everything make sure you can show,0.07017088
it by somebody's actions their facial expressions you know things going on in the background,0.19286872
so that way you're not making your audience feel stupid by telling them everything that's,0.8270471
going on another thing I really love about this movie is you get a slight,0.1599345
sense of what it's like growing up in the hood because like I said this,0.076692276
takes place in Miami it's a poor neighborhood so you see what it's like when,0.2415277
there's in your neighborhood you can see what it's like when you know your parents,0.11207152
are working in some of them just don't pay attention to you and you kind,0.14552976
of see what it's like for the kids who are going you know going through,0.06859144
this and and how they interact with each other also since you're getting kind of,0.08423811
a glimpse of what it's like to live in a poor neighborhood they don't focus,0.2415567
and rely on stereotypes which I love because it's it's refreshing where it's like it's,0.058331016
a story about a young black man growing up in the hood and there's no,0.31089434
you know real obvious stereotypes the topics that this covers are similar to kind of,0.109117046
the stereotypes but they do it in a way where it's more realistic and less,0.06231626
you know exaggerated I told you there's drugs that are kind of mentioned in this,0.26629677
movie but the way they talk about drugs is never like glamorized this doesn't seem,0.15635061
like oh I want to be a drug dealer one day like no glamorizing the,0.4011407
subject no one's extra aggressive for no reason like there's lots of good cases of,0.094138525
it just being you know like oh this is just there this would really do,0.056946743
a great job of depicting do different ways that closeted a gay man might act,0.34417906
in a poorer neighborhood especially a poor black neighborhood I'll give you a slight spoiler,0.59863675
but there's a character named Kevin and he's of there closeted gay Mian in the,0.1281761
movie now both of them act in certain ways definitely based on personality and definitely,0.087836966
based on the fact that they are both closeted both of them are you know,0.1582691
closeted gay men but both are acting in a different way to make sure they're,0.55481565
still you know being closeted Sharon's just consoling he if you say he's gay he's,0.69542736
like just doesn't make any comment on it or he'll just be like no and,0.098076545
you know don't try to prove nothing Kevin I love the hand he's trying to,0.15361083
prove that he's an I gave and trying to beat you to even having the,0.44153538
assumption that he could be gay oh they're very valid ways that someone can can,0.61088187
act in those environments so for them to showcase both of them is so great,0.119749315
to me me usually when you see coming of the LGBT community that's black usually,0.44518968
they kind of fall into the extremes at least what usually ends up happening in,0.13310398
entertainment so usually they're either very very feminine or very very masculine both are very,0.23983683
you know valid ways that people live but the media always tends to do the,0.064815275
extremes now Kevin and shyrone to me for more in the middle cash our own,0.10903019
these Falls more towards the feminine side because of the stereotypes that people associate with,0.17841092
being feminine so you kind of fits in its light like a little little nudge,0.40330857
but not you know not obviously to the extreme Kevin's masculine in stereotypical terms of,0.080381565
being masculine but you know not all the way at the end of the spectrum,0.12673797
because he's not looking for a fight he's not beating up somebody every five seconds,0.25200114
he's not only ever talking about girls if it's more I want to say like,0.3453466
more in the middle but you know still still a little masculine which you know,0.10442951
obviously it's especially lost all members of the spectrum are it completely valued by for,0.06268998
the media for our film to show to people who are kind of you know,0.15412639
in the middle on lunch maybe on one side or another is so great because,0.049016915
it allows young black gay men and you know anybody else to be like okay,0.69542736
there's more than just obviously the extremes there's people in the middle there's people who,0.11181781
maybe not on one side listening spectrums or spectrums because people can fly all over,0.071580194
they want to me it's so important that the media showcases both of them or,0.07964023
just kind of chilling now let's talk about the filmmaking of this movie disclaimer I,0.08734319
am NOT a film critic I really just recently just got into kind of focusing,0.112138
on a film but the parts of it some rather than just looking at the,0.056004442
movie as a whole I really just kind of started looking at what is the,0.050671954
soundtrack China saying what is the lighting trying to say and what are they trying,0.09884105
to say by zooming in or the wide shot saying in the plot and all,0.15528713
those kind of thing I just only just started so pick it as someone who's,0.09915467
just kind of getting more into movies because I used to just be a casual,0.15260905
movie watcher now I'm really kind of focusing on you know what's going on in,0.09182681
the movie moon lights filming with Beijing's directing and everybody else of part of the,0.06212372
film crew who you know had some input in it I think they just did,0.07227825
such a good job now like I said it's just my opinion but my opinion,0.07308219
is backed up by critics because if you're gonna write in Tomatoes more Lighting's definitely,0.081525266
saying that like a ninety-eight ninety-nine percent which is obviously really good and then if,0.09124863
you look at the Oscars from 2016 you can see that they won best picture,0.06399271
which is one of the most prestigious awards you can get during the award seasons,0.04472266
and at the Oscars there's a won an Oscar for Best Screenplay adaption and then,0.037286606
I believe Marshall I won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor I think regardless pretty,0.08210818
sure they also got a Golden Globe like I read like the talk during an,0.11897023
awards season so I mean I'm saying it's good but you also have prestigious you,0.08856495
know boozy filmmakers who are also agreeing with my opinion even though they won there,0.07112315
two or three Oscars I still think Barry Jenkins probably should have got like a,0.06220434
Best Director Oscar because he did such a fantastic job I mean like in the,0.077842005
movie I feel like each scene has a purpose which sounds stupid because you know,0.72274107
it's a movie all the scenes should have a purpose in the end but nowadays,0.09756929
most movies be having scenes for who knows what reason just to have the scene,0.12748839
if you think about a movie in your life well they probably could have cut,0.24009019
out this scene there's no scene in this movie that they could cut out that's,0.110210106
how purposeful each scene if this movie is because you take one part out and,0.15466827
you're gonna be slightly lost like and I just think I just think that's so,0.26600814
impressive like I said I'm not a film critic but so that might be the,0.07120903
basis of all really good films but to me it's just so impressive that each,0.11228449
scene is so pivotal and so you know impactful for the the message of the,0.1082171
movie as I said previously this movie doesn't beat you over its head with the,0.18512657
message of the movie and the theme however they do have some themes that you,0.08870619
can pick up on let's reoccurring in the movie like I said it's still not,0.09942628
beating you over the head but you notice them if you paying attention so one,0.65660167
of the things is the color blue the color blue is mentioned and shown many,0.008517628
a times in this movie as I told you the screenplay that the movie this,0.08487306
is based off of is called in like black boys love blue so obviously they,0.20901948
were gonna incorporate blue in there but they did such a great job of just,0.062081747
little hints of blue lights sometimes a character would be wearing the color blue but,0.025458429
you don't even notice cuz you just like well it's a shirt the walls will,0.17438202
be blue you know something that the background is blue all of these things that,0.052069366
you don't fully you're just like oh well you know it's just the color the,0.17997514
way they implement it I was always trying to tell you something the same can,0.07592301
be said for water water is also mentioned and shown in the movie I mean,0.04945227
first of all they're living in Miami so you're gonna see the water at the,0.13913853
beach because it's Miami so there's the beach scenes that's kind of recurring in the,0.113103054
movie and there's other little things that just kind of deal with water that always,0.057144698
mean something I won't obviously go into full detail with all the mentions of water,0.053759802
and the color blue because I'm not trying to spoil the whole movie for you,0.0786759
but if you give it a watch pay attention to some of those things and,0.07639733
you know actually self what is it trying to say what is it trying to,0.10383655
invoke out of you why do you think they put it there because I think,0.16226424
it's fun to try to see what you interpret out of it and if you,0.09858928
do come back to this video and let me know or you know me personally,0.18143988
hit me up and let me know along with the the lighting of the themes,0.36117426
the sound design of this movie ooh sound design is also as impactful as the,0.07117625
lighting in like the camera shots because this movie has little dialogue compared to like,0.13656774
a normal movie there's a good amount of scenes where people aren't talking where it's,0.15609394
just kind of silent and I know you're probably like Sabrina silence is not a,0.11003223
part of sound design but it is good sound as I so really focuses on,0.027393067
the silent moments of the film which moon like does moonlight features some really silent,0.049231924
bushings or like close to starting where you just hear like a little whisper of,0.12302821
classical music the silence and sometimes some of the scenes is so important because you,0.15573034
feel you know how shyrone is feeling in the moment you can tell just the,0.072838016
way that the silence works with the film there's also some parts where the sound,0.08573585
kind of gets distorted and those are the kind of things that kind of put,0.18793832
you in the position of shyrone and you can kind of feel what he's feeling,0.20019889
just based on you know the weights some of the sound is distorted or it,0.0704336
sounds like you're underwater or if you're at the beach how come kind of feel,0.13806747
or or the loneliness and the silence you all kind of feel those as if,0.33843774
you're shy room I also would like to mention that the fact that this is,0.104820475
a movie about a young black man in you know technically the hoodie soundtrack is,0.2407115
not ramping with hip-hop I'm not saying that's a problem but it's refreshing they're always,0.06304948
putting the association with hip-hop with you know being a young black man or just,0.5500588
a black man in general honestly I mean I think there's maybe two sections where,0.49000672
they have hip-hop playing but for the most part it's silent it's the sounds of,0.08346754
the environment or there's like classical or old-school like doo-wop and R&B the way moonlight,0.14135529
ends is something I also really admire about this movie this movies sort of like,0.10119783
a coming of age and usually but those kind of movies you know by the,0.051209074
end of the movie all the problems that was in the movie is solved everything's,0.08479939
wrapped up in a nice little bow you know that they're going into college or,0.1499366
you know that they find the love of their life or whatever you know all,0.14893366
the issues with their parents are relatively solved for the time being but the way,0.052759606
this ends to me is so much more realistic I'll give you this analogy it,0.08993376
ends where it's like you and a friend are talking and talking about a story,0.08971687
that happened in their life but instead of going and then you know we hug,0.05449673
then everything was great they go and you know I don't know we'll see what,0.09416728
that's kind of how this movie and not everything needs to be fully told to,0.067004964
you you can have some liberty of having some fun and figuring out on your,0.2533589
own one thing I really wanted to make sure I mentioned about moonlight it's the,0.06283066
fact that this movie has an all black cast did you hear me I said,0.35660475
all black cast and and I would say at minimum 80% of the cast is,0.14168894
all dark-skinned people like can I get a hearty Amen I say that because usually,0.7447313
we're talking about a backup movie film TV show I guarantee you they're gonna focus,0.11185226
on light-skinned or brown skinned people and though maybe have one maybe two four really,0.46028414
lucky dark-skinned characters but this movie this movie said not not a lot we gonna,0.3587353
have mostly dark-skinned black people in our movie and I'm just oh but I will,0.7716489
critique though is that the women in this film are not dark-skinned white I'm taking,0.49008784
what I can I'm a big advocate for dark-skinned people in TV shows and film,0.5453334
because we just don't be getting that kind of representation and I need that in,0.06322332
my life when I say all black has yes I'm talking about the main characters,0.28693452
that we're focusing on all of them are black why the director Bear Jenkins a,0.42270768
black man Tarell Alvin McCraney who wrote the original play black gay man I mean,0.51435053
let's really dive into the importance of this all-black cast and the writers and director,0.28904486
being black people because what did I say earlier none of this feels stereotypical they're,0.6766369
not beating you over the head with stereotypical black thing why because it's written by,0.6733345
black people directed by black people so they know they know they lived it they,0.76809984
know the experiences that will go on in real life so what do they do,0.05100896
they put real life into action this is why we need black people right in,0.5597063
black people before I started getting real high over the black cast I really want,0.5819736
to talk about the actors who play Kevin and shyrone as previously mentioned the movie,0.07691554
covers three chapters of shower rooms like so obviously there's gonna be three different actors,0.16830628
playing Shiro and Kevin appears in all three of these chapters of Shaun's life so,0.064485304
there's also gonna be three actors who play Kevin now the three actors who play,0.06465543
shy rooms but those are all is played by two auntie Rhodes teenage Tyrone is,0.083836704
played by Ashton Sanders and kitchen Aaron is played by Alex Herbert Charles the lead,0.07864243
character all three of them really needed to be on their game and all three,0.05203659
of them absolutely delivered shyrone is not much of a speaker he doesn't talk much,0.14218825
in this movie so a lot of the acting that goes into this movie is,0.07980242
his body language and facial expressions so for all three of these actors to exude,0.29451287
the same energy and characteristics that shyrone would have is magnificent with Kevin we don't,0.08568868
get as much time with him because obviously he's not the main character and not,0.10064135
in his perspective but I'm still not going to diminish their role because all three,0.090593286
of them are still and tastic little kevin is played by actor named Jayden minor,0.14851741
teenage Kevin is played by jor-el Jerome an adult Kevin is played by Andre Holland,0.078004405
all of them are so charming because that's one of the main characteristics of Kevin,0.08298494
at least to me is he's a very charming man he's very likeable though for,0.23157685
all three of them to be charming in the same way at the various different,0.07628799
ages is Jeff's case since I'm talking about Kevin and sharone I want to talk,0.050042152
about the way that this film depicts their relationship I say shyrone and Kevin's relationship,0.1118245
is one of my favorite things about this movie because it plays right into what,0.09259225
I really enjoy now as you're getting to watch more of my videos and hear,0.1566643
about some of my opinions you'll learn that I love a good subtle flirting I,0.11700313
enjoy the real your face flirting that's that's fun and all but I really love,0.24102214
a good subtle flirtation where you mister viewer are like oh what they just are,0.16799496
they just flirting like oh they're trying to play it off as if they're not,0.1448153
flirting but they're definitely flirting cuz you're looking at their eyes and you're looking at,0.14467369
the way they're acting and you're like order definitely flirting that's my Jo what's just,0.1649885
was he looking at me like that so now they're obviously not going to be,0.14934207
outright flirting with each other because they're both at the end of the day closeted,0.25432983
gay men so well I don't know about Kevin Kevin could be bisexual it's the,0.6874252
way the camera pans to Kevin's face or the way that the camera will kind,0.24202402
of linger on a touch or position of one of the actors bodies towards the,0.11104766
other it's just Oh like I said this woman does a fantastic job of showing,0.2697724
and not telling so it's showing you you're getting the vibes that they are flirting,0.18188252
it really it really sells the romance that's going on there it really sells the,0.03614172
romance of the movie usually with news about gay men are usually just generally the,0.31089434
conception of the LGBT community is that it's really sexualized like media portrays it in,0.4828538
such an overly sexual way that if you see a gay character on a show,0.7093121
or in a movie it's always kind of based on the sex part of relationships,0.5238309
and not really the romance part this movie really focuses on the romance the intimacy,0.093630925
of relationship is so important with the way they kind of display the relationship that,0.046771627
goes on I slightly spoiled that Kevin and shyrone engage in a sexual activity I'm,0.7139737
not gonna say what sexual activity watch the movie to find out it's really you,0.52458185
know press bonded but engaged in a sexual activity at some point in their life,0.53490317
and the way the movie portrays it it's so focused on the intimacy of the,0.08314172
act instead of the lustfulness of the act and I think that's one romantic and,0.104778625
very cute in my eyes but it's also important for people to see and for,0.15014388
you know young gay black men to see that not everything needs to be so,0.8060606
lustful there's a lot of good in intimacy and showing the love of relationship rather,0.2411009
than just kind of the lust it's so wonderful with the way that they chose,0.13535751
to do it at this point I've got on enough about moonlight and honestly I,0.07470244
could go for more but that would require me spoiling some parts of the movie,0.1550751
and this would be like two hours long to some of this overview of I,0.1519645
greatly enjoyed this movie I've seen about three times now and it's definitely something I,0.11548766

got from this movie you can get something else out of it but the main,0.08343564
thing that to meet the movie was trying to say in the beginning in the,0.06249914
movie Marshall Ollie's character toes shyrone a story the message that I got from the,0.07212791
story and the film as a whole was that if I'm going to perceive you,0.07387276
in a certain way and people are going to try to tell you who you,0.09328806
are but these are those things define who you actually are you have to figure,0.046164412
out for yourself who you are and that is the most important thing and to,0.12547769
me that's such a great message to put out to the world because yes /,0.092938066
