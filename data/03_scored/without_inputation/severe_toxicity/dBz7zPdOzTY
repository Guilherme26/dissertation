hey everybody Christina here for Cinna fix I went and saw Pixar's new movie inside,0.057930842
out a little early and I'm gonna tell you how it was first off I'm,0.04714622
guessing if you're thinking about seeing inside out there's really two things you want to,0.027795363
know how it ranks and the greater Pixar hierarchy and how many times its gonna,0.024034416
make you cry to answer the first question it's at least a solid ratatouille maybe,0.091201335
better pretty pretty darn good to even really great as for the crying question I,0.17822598
missed it up twice and got a little lump in my throat once but no,0.16065316
actual tears there were tons of things I loved about this movie the voice acting,0.05937629
was really great especially Phyllis Smith as sadness and Lewis Black his anger was just,0.040337402
like the most perfectly cast actor in the history of cinema the animation to go,0.029463645
with them was great it was spot-on and it was constantly clever and surprising the,0.06967067
world was really rich and well imagined the the representation of the workings of a,0.015358425
person's mind were we're really cool and surprising and there was always something kind of,0.025779191
new that you were like oh that's right that makes sense overall I'm gonna try,0.06572347
to keep this review pretty vague cuz I went into it knowing almost nothing more,0.082066365
than what you see in the trailers and I think a lot of other people,0.04581253
want to do that too so I'm gonna try to talk around any actual plot,0.052479
points but I am gonna talk about a few of the things that were in,0.030053662
the trailers and if you somehow deliberately avoided the trailers then why are you watching,0.010252476
this review hit watch later come back go on go the movie centers around the,0.1856042
emotions of Riley who's an 11 year old girl and well she's dealing with some,0.2015287
things and so are her emotions as Riley deals with those things two of her,0.016413406
emotions joy and sadness get lost in the long-term memory section of her Riley's mind,0.06392415
and they have to deal with each other so the folks at Pixar this is,0.02745213
this is the sort of thing they do they communicate abstract mechanics of a person's,0.07857948
psyche in a really fun clever visual way so that that's a delight and you,0.05216503
know the more you like that the more you'll like the movie as a whole,0.038170233
that said I would personally probably trade a few of those really clever moments for,0.021047076
a little bit more character development about the relationship between joy and sadness it's clear,0.028570969
that these two characters have a have a conflict with each other but it's it's,0.034715936
all a little bit surface which kind of makes sense because they're one emotion characters,0.060532376
but you know it would have been nice to explore that a little bit deeper,0.06408246
overall the landscape of Riley's mind reminds me a lot of the spaceship scenes and,0.024658358
wall-e and the scenes at Paradise Falls and up Pixar creates these like really amazing,0.062296443
well imagined worlds but I found in talking to a lot of friends that they're,0.028460547
very divisive like wall-e and up sort of lost a lot of people when the,0.076548666
dogs started talking and flying airplanes or when it's all fat humans in wheelchairs under,0.39135826
their robot overlords and I think that the setting of inside out might have had,0.051150627
a slightly similar effect on me like I didn't entirely emotionally connect with this world,0.034931455
because while I was delighted to discover it it didn't necessarily feel real the way,0.013215869
Carl and Ellie not being able to have a kid and up did inside out,0.08723418
also didn't benefit from the amazing like first 10 to 20 minutes that wall-e and,0.04339791
up both had so your mileage on connecting to this world may vary I ended,0.05804858
up seeing inside out alone just due to hazards of scheduling so I missed out,0.04876794
on the chance to see if somebody else had connected with the world in a,0.040447824
different way than I had I think that there's a really good chance that people,0.033686895
will like this movie more than I did but I don't think there are that,0.023642622
many people who are going to like it less than I did unless they you,0.064151645
know hate cartoons in which case I don't think you were planning to see this,0.09338979
anyway so all in all if you're interested in seeing inside out you should definitely,0.059575845
see it I think that it's a really solid effort by Pixar not it's best,0.04313716
not its worst but you might have a little bit of you might have a,0.060729936
similar experience as I did which is I don't quite feel as connected to these,0.026349254
characters as I have with other characters in me and Pixar universe one small caveat,0.010634956
if you happen to be going with a kid between the ages of like I,0.1688868
don't know four and six there are some representations in Riley's mind of things that,0.015649775
that scared her as a little kid that are brought back and like cartoonishly over-the-top,0.07385534
funny hilarious ways but so anyone over the age of eight will be able to,0.042217877
laugh at those moments but if you're dealing with like a much more literal minded,0.074438706
small small child you might be dealing with a little bit of Nightmare fuel so,0.12924652
just keep that in mind overall I think this is Pixar's best movie since Toy,0.06258247
Story 3 in that like it definitely is better than brave and monsters University but,0.046123832
it's not in my personal top five Pixar movies although like I said it might,0.08753817
be in yours so you should definitely check it out and find out where it,0.04007665
stands up for you so that's what I thought of inside out but I want,0.07894134
to hear what you think are you gonna go see it have you seen it,0.027045703
already what did you think what did you think of the the crazy psyche landscape,0.1133892
that the Pixar folks imagined up remember to like and subscribe and come back next,0.018100312
time for more movie news and reviews are in cinah fix now joy brings a,0.0131932525
