and the infinium creature she encounters there after it being captured and begins to be,0.24004407
tested on and as soon as the two encounter each other they form a very,0.0676799
unique and very special bond due to the fact that none of them can necessarily,0.059865396
speak like anybody else guillermo del toro is a very talented and very passionate filmmaker,0.08631842
and whenever he comes into a project whether you like a film of his or,0.11803569
not you can always see and feel his passion for said project and here you,0.16725029
can see and feel that once more every element of storytelling in here works beautifully,0.07286406
his craftsmanship as a director his camera movement in here is mesmerizing I was hypnotized,0.23972775
in about five minutes into this film the way he moves the camera around the,0.09516269
set and around the characters just telling a story just letting these characters act their,0.033035204
actions throughout as you see routines and their jobs and what they do in their,0.054976963
leisure times it's also beautifully captured and so uniquely captured by Del Toro's eye for,0.06509269
telling a story and also the set design and cinematography are absolutely jaw-dropping this is,0.040705696
one of the best looking films of 2017 even though I'm reviewing it in 2018,0.07029285
the use of colour and lights just to tell a story how they'll Toro is,0.051220357
using a frame and you see colors change and lights and shadows morphing together and,0.06926359
breaking apart from each other it's some of the best work I have seen from,0.08151822
this man and this man is known for working with these elements in very unique,0.22608054
ways the film also carries some of the best performances of the year with Sally,0.015705757
Hawkins absolutely on her way to stealing the Oscars I have said this about DiCaprio,0.32025084
in the revenant I'll say it again for Sally Hawkins in here the best work,0.06069423
an actor can do is saying absolutely everything and anything without uttering a single word,0.070874415
Sally Hawkins does that in here her character is absolutely lovable and whimsical and you,0.0748197
cannot help but fall in love with her she reminds me a lot of Amelie,0.3274057
as well as the film as a whole it is Amelie meets of monster film,0.34613588
but the film doesn't necessarily follow the tropes of a monster movie it has one,0.19705705
single element from those films but it never falls onto those cliches it carries this,0.120663375
love story throughout and it is committed to that love story throughout it never feels,0.05327385
cheesy it also feels earned because of the commitment del Toro has to this story,0.07034263
and is audacity as some of the things that he makes happen in this story,0.05955444
without spoiling anything Michael Shannon as the villain is also very layered he's menacing and,0.19239846
terrifying there's a lot that you can read into his character also Michael Stuhlbarg who,0.17091809
has another amazing performance in 2017 after call me by her name and Richard Jenkins,0.080226764
who is just everything a neighbor should be and isn't speaking from personal experience this,0.05741577
guy I just want to hug him I just want to hug him hang out,0.31636262
with him and eat some key lime pie with him and I absolutely cannot do,0.16358364
a review of the film without mentioning and praising the practical work on the inferior,0.15777838
creature which is just out of this world from the way he interacts with Sally,0.24223568
Hawkins from the way he interacts with the setting from the way there are some,0.051291008
lights in his body that will not spoil why they are there Doug Jones underneath,0.2045468
all this makeup and underneath all these prosthetics and underneath everything he just becomes this,0.60509133
character but also the character itself carries this weight throughout the film that makes you,0.0032149071
feel for it so much and also fits into the thematics there are also there,0.04083663
in the other characters and in the story itself there's some magical and that's the,0.01904967
right word magical work in here with this practical creature being brought to life but,0.1489966
beyond those mesmerizing visuals and the amazing performances also the well-developed characters in this film,0.05603343
there's also a recurring theme throughout and that is the lack of a sense of,0.100847736
belonging and the sense of feeling like an outcast all the characters in this film,0.09030115
in their own way find themselves in this place in life where they don't feel,0.1540287
like they belong and or they don't feel like they have fulfilled everything they should,0.15014017
in their lives they don't feel realized Eliza for instance is a mute woman and,0.34970275
she is a cleaning lady and once she meets this creature it's the first time,0.40547246
a living being has not looked at her and was not taken aback by the,0.1129141
fact that she was mute they learned to communicate with each other very organically and,0.17465162
they are learning with each other and they don't have any prejudice or bigotry towards,0.10882172
each other whatsoever and that's a bond that this film explores deeply well and in,0.059960544
a very loving way even Michael Shannon as the villain as I said there's a,0.18621664
lot of layers to him because he doesn't feel necessarily fulfilled he's working under some,0.10391666
people that he doesn't think he should be working under of also Michael Stuhlbarg without,0.13283204
spoiling anything he also is an outcast in his own way he's a scientist who,0.41343465
wants to research the creature with very very pure intentions and Richard Jenkins as I,0.24146652
said amazing performance what his character goes through in the silmas beautiful arc really fits,0.0657987
into what the backdrop is of this film there's a dark world being explored but,0.13520524
even in this dark world in these dark times there's a beautiful love story to,0.09732672
be found there are beautiful characters to be found relatable characters and a gorgeous direction,0.053367764
and storytelling from del Toro with also an amazing help from the score well Toro,0.05084146
has crafted something very special in here something that I feel many people will appreciate,0.080691025
in their own different levels and their own different ways because there are a lot,0.07008315
of themes in here that can be discusses day to day with just people that,0.077522

water probably his best and one of his most unique feature films I know that,0.0629415
