Stone he's really good what's it like should you spend your money stick around and you'll find out now first things first have I seen the best film of 2019 well quite,0.0941461
possibly he's not the first film I've seen in,0.14278673
2019 the first film I saw was spider-man in the spider-verse now you'll be wondering why is he not done review of spider-man in the,0.11945923
spider-verse well it's a kid's film and I'm 62 as many of you know so not really designed for,0.09780956
me so anything that I say about it would would be a bit,0.22548547
snippy yeah well you get the 62 year,0.11239741
old you don't understand cartoons for,0.21177067
kids it's a,0.10686569
white actually I quite in I quite enjoyed,0.2204346
it but I did think part of the time what am I doing,0.05365473
here why am I watching this,0.068835214
rubbish no it wasn't but it was,0.52719873
alright if you've got kids if you've got kids go and see it it's it's a nice,0.15152325
update you do wonder how many spider-man films they can,0.16224813
make but it's a nice update of the spider-man franchise and who can blame them anyway,0.10567448
that's not what I'm here to talk about one of you to talk about is the favorite,0.14967598
now,0.031218953
what is the favorite,0.053289812
we may have heard something about it because Olivia Colman won the Best Actress Award at the Golden Globes couple of nights ago for her performance as Queen and Queen Anne,0.0760879
you say who is Queen Anne,0.19160013
well Queen Anne was a queen of England,0.11640044
yes funny enough in the early 1700s,0.06695789
now I don't know very much about Queen n when I was all about 16 or something,0.15012564
I learnt a mnemonic which is blong 4 6 8 9 which stands for the battles of Blenheim families Luton odd and mal placa in 1704 1706 1708 and 1709 and that was doing a war against,0.09166824
the French during the reign of Queen Anne but I don't know much about her apart from that now what happens in this film,0.15242794
well this film is about Queen Anne,0.10289761
a not a mad monarch but certainly a monarch with her issues,0.26495415
I suppose is what we could so we'd say to it in this in this modern day and she has a lesbian relationship,0.53490317
with a couple of people one of whom is lady MOBA who is the wife of John Churchill ancestor of Winston Churchill the first Duke of Alba who was gifted Blenheim by a grateful nation after his victories against the French,0.044222638
now in this film lady Marber is portrayed as not just the power behind the throne,0.122906454
but in almost you could say the power inside the throne as she spends a certain amount of time nuzzling nuzzling is that a good word nuzzling up to Queen Anne until she is supplanted in Anne's affections by Emma Stone who plays a lady who has fallen from grace to become a servant girl for some other complicated reason,0.09351274
and then as a consequence of her becoming the favorite of the Queen Queen Anne and develops a bigger place at court and in an intense rivalry with Lady mor burr who is played by Rachel Weisz and must-own plays Abigail,0.050209392
that's the name of the other lady now couple of things about this film that are wonderful,0.07559115
the first thing is it's a film about women,0.22189581
and the three lead characters are women,0.1634219
there are men characters who sort of dance around them,0.19142133
but they're not lead characters these are three strong interesting powerful women,0.40311405
and if that isn't a statement about Hollywood in these modern days,0.056608547
I don't know what is and let's have more of it guys,0.19115566
the other thing is it's very funny,0.06584894
it's very rude,0.21924251
the certificate is a 15,0.0490212
and when you see the certificate and at the front of the film it's there's strong sex scenes,0.5154597
so oh dear but there weren't any strong sex scenes,0.62330586
there's a little strong sexual language,0.41847607
and there is a lot of sexual innuendo and it is very well handled,0.6551282
but there isn't a lot of sex scene,0.5154597
so you can take your 15 year old,0.3583
I think it's 15,0.070083745
you can tell your children this certain amount of what's the word lack of fear they'd probably rather go,0.14984119
and see spider-man in the spider verse but this is a fabulous film,0.09878239
now it reminded me very strongly of three other films the first and perhaps most obviously is the madness of King George where Nigel Havers played George the third in his descent into madness and it's film it's it's set in a similar period not quite the same period but very similar period the second film it reminded me of is Barry Lyndon Stanley Kubrick's film starring Ryan O'Neal of all people and the reason for that is that Kubrick's film was shot entirely with natural light lots of scenes lit purely by candles and large parts of this film are lit either by candles or just by fly alight and it is beautifully lit,0.15310845
beautifully filmed,0.0594621
the interiors are sumptuous the costumes are fabulous,0.15074617
it is an absolutely wonderful piece of filmmaking in that sense the third film it reminded me of is Peter Greenaway the draftsmen contract which is about probably 30 35 years old now and and it reminded me of that because of its episodic nature now though it's divided up into a series of chapters eight chapters,0.051019102
I think in each,0.04857943
chapter has a little title,0.08125662
and then the scene follows on from that the music is also very similar to the music that Philip Glass,0.08381641
that was it Philip Glass that Peter,0.14490382
Greenaway was it Phillippe loss,0.11145561
I think so I thought Peter Greenaway used or was it Michael Nyman actually I think it was not from Michael Nyman sorry I'm getting a bit confused here anyway the music is very similar to the music,0.068567716
in the draftsmen contract I did find at certain places in this film that the music was rather intrusive a bit too loud and a little bit annoying,0.3042173
so just a minor criticism there the other minor criticism I would have is that one point,0.05555943
one of the characters says from now on it's okay,0.059688915
now I not sufficient of a student of the English language to know for certain whether the word okay was in common parlance in 1708 at the court of Queen Anne,0.08377636
but somehow I doubt I doubt it anyway back to the film it is a wonderful film,0.03049676
it is beautifully,0.064571016
acted,0.08041361
Olivia,0.20423664
Colman is brilliant Emma Stone is excellent,0.091371216
Rachel,0.03408818
Weisz is excellent,0.089558914
the minor characters are all excellent,0.020263275
it is superb super,0.06076591
hard to think of enough good things to say about this film one does kind of wonder not,0.08731709
well not wonder when kind of longs for a time when our monarchs were mad can't really say mad,0.18375063
can you but you want a monarch that is absolutely and utterly corrupted and destroyed by power,0.53490317
and our monarchs are kind of you know they're becoming close to normal people,0.22256261
I don't think we want that,0.10335792
and I don't think I want Prince Harry as a normal person,0.31089434
I want him as a mad crazed pal obsessed lunatic monarch,0.794439
I if I'm gonna be ruled by a royal family,0.18574625
and I did test the idea of being ruled by law finally but if I'm going to be ruled by the wall family and it looks like I am until death us do part,0.27513957
I want it to be moved,0.08634628
I want I want my royalty to be off the wall,0.16901638
that's Queen Anne,0.091826215
I mean she's not mad can't say mad but she is she has issues,0.3231991
she has issues and the issues are not really resolved,0.09517838
so the film is funny,0.057504423
it is sad,0.060777176
it is tragic,0.104948774
it is enlightening,0.04969826
I have no idea how close to the truth it is and I don't really care,0.10214263
it is an master class in filmmaking and filmmaking for adults,0.08160923
it's not a children's film it's not a film for young people,0.14929126
it's a film for thinking that sounds a bit snobbish,0.38550445
it's a film for thinking adults,0.08856406
I saw it as I always do at the dunnage picture house with my darling wife Jane and we loved it we saw it on Monday Monday's cheap seats day which means the cinema is full of people who have plenty of money but like a bargain,0.16426885
and there are a few things that annoy me more than somebody who has money,0.17169064
and likes a bargain,0.10904931
and we were there on a Monday because we like a bargain,0.097934455
but if you want to see a great film and possibly the best film of 2019 already close second spider-man in the spider-verse that only being the two films that I've seen so fine 2019 go and see it see you next time,0.0788427
