and i've said it a million times but i really love that setting oh family this is so cute i had suspicions about the wrong man don't let it make you cry that's not that's a that's a joke bonjour welcome back legends i washed my hair so i thought it'd be rude if i didn't film a video would be disrespectful but yeah we're back with another disney film coco don't shout at me i've never seen it i'm uncultured i get it yeah we're gonna do this i don't have much to say it's pixar it's disney i expect greatness i've heard nothing but good things about this film so let's see this is a disappointment i don't think it is if you haven't already please don't forget to subscribe it mean the world to me and wash it down and don't forget to turn the notification bell so you get notified every single time i upload as well as that if you like this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up if you didn't like it that's fine that's before you like it sweetheart my free will for now and if you want to see more of me i won't pay for your therapy but instagram is out rebecca rose with an exit of the first d and twitter is out rebecca wright with an x over the second e bam okay we're just gonna get into this i am tired oh my god it's not the normal disney intro theme so i can't sing along 10 seconds later [Music] never mind i still could always believe in yourself should i bought the tissues for this film should i too late now [Music] oh a skull oh day of the dead oh is this gonna be sad i bet you this is sad i mean it already looks beautiful i'll give them that she didn't have time to cry over that walkway musician [Music] after banishing all music from her life oh i thought she's going to banish all men mood every year the day of the dead bam i knew it psychic [Music] i thought she was about to that was the toy story pizza delivery van oh we love some easter eggs i caught that nothing goes past me but my all-time [Music] favorite oh isn't this like the famous song from coco everyone talks about remember me until 1942 when he was crowned by a giant bell that's so dark surely the guy who messed up there's like imprisonment that's so dark disney fully just crushed a man you are a musician no i don't know i mean i only really play for myself ah not gonna lie this looks so pretty though the animation the background the colors it's a very vibrant film so far we're not fans of grandma her walk scares me all this work to bring the family together i don't want to sneak is miguel i don't know what his name is i think it's miguel is he gonna meet his whole family tree and they're all gonna inspire him to go back to music and he's gonna raise how musical his family once was and then he goes to the talent show and wins with the power of family that's my prediction [Music] i just realized why i recognize this dog because they have his statue in disneyland that's why i recognized him i it was bugging me so much i was like i recognize that dog he's been somewhere [Music] else the talent he just he is a what's the word for a he's a prodigy that's what miguel is i'm gonna play in mariachi plaza if it kills me don't tell me miguel dies if that happens that's not the darkest disney has gone killing a child surely they're not gonna do that i'm not certain i don't care if i'm on some stupid offrender okay not a fan of grandma that's a step too far with that many candles around i'd be very scared that at any second i'd set myself a light [Music] i did not like the way that moved why wasn't it pushed up against the mantle that's the health and safety hazard if i've ever seen one i need to borrow this see i saw the embers the family are coming back from the dead for the day of the dead and they're gonna guide miguel to the path of music all right who's in there i'm sorry it's not what it looks like oh miguel is currently dead i thought the other ones were dead miguel's dead plot twist [Music] see i told you he was gonna meet every single person from his family oh now that do be some good animation it's just very pretty the color choices ah it's not nice oh that's kind of sound when you think about though like why did she have a really young girl on the other side of her and remember oh this is such a pure little film oh oh this is really cute [Music] this is ernesto it might be ernesto because his family didn't put the photo up it doesn't look like ernesto though but most importantly you can help me [Music] oh so that's not ernesto i give up with that theory that he's ernesto i've grown up now i've moved on [Music] she has a dragon or whatever this thing is it's basically a dragon now that is cool oh no dante's gonna die oh my god dante's dead no no the dog died oh my heart that's so rude another dog dying come on don't do this to me i don't have the time for a breakdown right now it's a crossover no one's ever put up my picture but okay the dog's okay that was a lie i apologize for that cool off chemical come on i'll get you this guy antoine seems so dodgy what's his business who's his family why does he seem so suspicious okay but also kind of sly and cool oh you just got slapped by a monkey yo how did you get in here i just followed my is this actually frida kahlo this is the real frida kahlo many forums this is frida kahlo that's kind of cool what do you know right this film though is so beautifully animated i cannot get over it it's just so nice to look at we're all the ones with no photos or friends no family to go home to nearly forgotten you know is miguel gonna start putting up this guy's photo in his house every year and he's going to become a part of the family that would be kind of cute ending i want to see that please please deliver i'm fading it i can feel it they can fade from the dead as well bro you're telling me there's more after death i am not prepared i thought death was it why do we have to keep moving gracias he just faded this is not legal they've just killed someone twice bruh are they for real no that feels kind of rude why am i so emotionally attached to some character that i've known for 3.5 seconds do i have issues yes i do oh my god i need to reevaluate my life but seriously oh why did grandma have to fade wait what happened he's been forgotten when there's no one left in the living world who remembers you you disappear from this world ah we call it oh my god that's so deep imagine feeling that unnecessary and irrelevant in the world oh that's kind of sad no you're so forgotten that you're erased from history our memories they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life in the stories they tell about us but there's no one left alive to pass down chicha's stories that's so sad oh why is that so sad why is this old man making me have a midlife crisis why did he fade away you hated musicians you never said you were the one oh my god but this beautiful i love oh it's just this looks so pretty and magical and i can't explain it but i love all the colors and it just speaks to my soul the word to describe it really is just beautiful this animation this setup this location this scene they just it just works so well this is a tough crowd no one seems that impressed oh yes man my favorite character now that guy who was jumping in the crowd okay but if this was america's got talent miguel here would pull through real strong all he's gotta do is tell a sob story be the child prodigy he is sing a sweet little heart out and get the crowd a smile and bam he's [Music] one it's a yes from me you're going to hollywood no not the dragon coming with his nostrils to ruin the spirit [Music] oh this is so cute team up we didn't know we needed a living is the family blind oh my jesus just look at the stage he's wearing red it's basically a beacon he could be shouting it's miguel i'm here the family man they need help i can't believe the family's looking everywhere but the stage they really don't want to find miguel that's the truth i thought you hated music oh i love them i remember that feeling when i don't let men ruin things for you is what this story is they've all banished music because of one man we don't allow that kind of power from a man in this household in this lifetime in this universe and i've said it a million times but i really love that setting i cannot praise it enough [Music] oh child abuse i'm calling i don't know what the child line line is i'm not calling anyone apparently this feels like showing up to the great gatsby mansion you know gatsby's mansion that's the kind of vibes i'd be getting is it even ernesto there though it has to be it is he finally turned around lil miguel's been waiting for this day since forever how could i not listen oh family this is so cute [Applause] this is next level wholesome stuff that sounds like it could possibly be a really sad song are they going to bring that back at the very end as miguel says goodbye to the land of the dead to go back to the land of the living you are being forgotten and whose fault is that hector please those were my songs you took my songs that made you famous he's stealing songs the drama ernesto's a liar he stole songs he took someone else's career and money we cannot respect that as a nation but in the movie tonight poisons the drink did ernesto poison antos drink oh my god this became a villain origin story the plot twist i'm going home ernesto hate me if you want but my mind is made up so he poisoned him he's like stay for one more drink i'm sending you off with a toast so ernesto just had poison on hand i had suspicions about the wrong man i should know better by now eat the rich you walked me to the train station but i felt the pain in my stomach i cannot believe the disrespect ernesto is next level messed up now i agree with the family but once again we did not banish music we banished the man metatrash poison me your confusing movie oh i feel so bad for anton i've got his name wrong i can just tell i just wanted to go back home bro i hate this story for hector put some more respect on hector's name as i say like i've been mispronouncing his name the whole time like i put respect on it the audacity i know my reputation it is very important to me i can't believe ernesto actually killed someone for music being his friend hector i feel personally attacked ernesto just keeps getting worse i should have known there's always a villain in these stories but i'm your family and hector was my best friend his kill count is going up does this man have no limitations oh my god i should have trusted grandma but i kind of did i know men are trash but oh my god he is the pinnacle of this [Music] they are so evil i am shooketh by how this movie took a turn bruh i love this movie this film is so good oh i didn't expect this from coco i'm sorry for underestimating you but this is such a good film no like seriously this film 10 out of 10. i love it i don't care how it ends it could end here and i never know what happens to miguel and i still love it why is this film so good it has the audacity to be this good brah i am so glad this film is so good oh my god if hector dies oh my god is hector gonna die heck just gonna fade away i'm not ready for this they're doing this to us they're so rude why the killing hector that he loved her so much hey coco coco that's why the films made coco excuse me is he the actual grandpa wait i'm so confused is that you i don't twist my brain oh did not deserve this disrespect oh this is so adorable i thought at least one day at cereal give her the biggest hug but she's the last person who remembers the moment she's gone from the living world you disappear oh no this is so sad [Music] what did i say this song was gonna come back and be sad don't let it make you cry for eve don't let it make you cry that's not that's a joke i'm gonna get so many wrinkles from crying at this film stop ageing me oh hector's gonna fade away now oh my god i'm gonna get a headache dante don't encourage the dog to jump please don't that will end the dog dante's actually a spirit guide now oh he has wings he can fly he can fly he can fly legendary come lady jump off the platform she had an option but she stayed on the platform if you want your two minutes of fame just say i won't judge back off ernesto can get off this stage how dare he i feel violated i forgot what that felt like no time for a romance let's get this photo back to the shrine because i want hector having his rightful place and the other side not being forgotten priorities hurry up touch it anywhere see we do not respect ernesto i really do hate this man too hard to let him destroy everything look at the family working together the power of family and they exposed him on the big screen they were like we're gonna put him on blast whatever it takes [Music] now this is some prime time reality tv for the audience also murder which i don't condone [Applause] [Music] hell yeah a full circle moment please we love poetry if he fades there's got to be some picture of hector somewhere i will print one i will draw one if i see him turn into dust particles okay we didn't see him fade into nothingness so there's still hope for hector they're not doing this to him well apologize miguel's going to sing remember me mama wait oh so they bring it back sad twice that's just rude [Music] oh it's complete like on nothing i predicted about this film was right and i love that we don't want predictable plot lines that's why this film was so good [Music] one year later the next day of the dead hector's gonna come back [Music] he's uncertain but he's gonna go through this time enjoy [Music] oh i'm so happy for our guy hector finally getting his respect he can pull through [Music] okay all i really have to say is uh that was a really lovely and beautiful film highly surprised by it i'm not gonna lie i went into it not expecting too much but i'm very happy with that result of a film bruh it's spectacular coco is highly underrated it is criminally underrated where's the respect for this film bro that was so good that was a masterpiece of cinema that's one of disney's best films i'm just gonna say like disney and pixar this is one of the best it's one of my favorite now i'm gonna have to add coco to my wall which is such a beautiful film about family and those songs were cute remember me i'm adding that to spotify every single version from that film is going on my playlist love the film i'm glad hector got his nice ending his happy ending he deserved it i'm glad ernesto got his ending too felt very what's the word it felt very rewarding but yeah i'm gonna leave it there i'm tired of this on my voice and i'm sure you're trying voice have a nice rest of your day and adios [Music] you
