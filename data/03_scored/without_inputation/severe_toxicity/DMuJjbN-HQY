hey everybody today I am going to be reviewing the film get out which is,0.028125295
the directorial debut for Jordan peel peel is of course known for being more of,0.015702326
an actor writer specializing mostly in in sketch comedy and things of that nature and,0.027698247
of course he was quite successful at that with the television show key & peele,0.016956862
and I think his comedy roots are very present here more so than you might,0.062486686
suspect by watching the trailer for this movie but to me this movie is almost,0.029139034
more of a hora D than just a straight-up horror film you know it's very,0.11855967
satirical it's cheeky it's mixing a lot of those horror cliches that we all know,0.21519622
and love from other horror films with a social commentary that is very very topical,0.04969188
and I don't think Pele could have picked a better time to write and make,0.022344183
a movie like this especially in the midst of such racial tension in such a,0.17405261
social divide Jordan Peele has said in a few interviews that he thinks that the,0.0342217
line between comedy and being afraid is very thin that there's almost no mine and,0.034639437
I kind of like that philosophy from him because I think he absolutely has a,0.033680245
point humor is often covering up fear or covering up discomfort in some way it's,0.021992302
almost like a defense mechanism but at what point does humor cross into becoming very,0.015099669
uncomfortable and then sometimes horror crosses over into humor I think they're both two very,0.048042223
exaggerated ends of the emotional spectrum and that's why they kind of bleed into each,0.2941632
other at a certain point I feel like when I film is getting me to,0.030829266
question things like that like when you're sitting there in a movie theater and you're,0.04856639
saying things like should I be laughing at that or oh that was really funny,0.026333291
but I kind of feel guilty about laughing that that's a good thing I think,0.041854687
that this film does that really really well and it does it through the vehicle,0.022437975
of exploring the minority experience which I'd say in mainstream Hollywood movies are especially in,0.031111969
mainstream Hollywood horror films you just don't see that very often this film is about,0.042075526
a guy named Chris he is a photographer he seems very easygoing very withdrawn he's,0.035855394
also black and he is dating a white woman named Rose they've been dating a,0.09463834
few months and they decide that now was the time for him to come home,0.02865478
with her for the weekend and meet the parents but she hasn't told them that,0.02409029
her boyfriend is black and as a white woman you know that's not something she's,0.25549588
ever had to think about so she doesn't really think too much of it she,0.050957058
kind of brushes it off says don't worry it'll be fine they're not racist bla,0.3274444
bla bla but obviously Chris has some concerns and rightfully so it turns out when,0.06396273
they get to the house everything just feels slightly off it's one of those things,0.0359432
where you can't quite pinpoint what it is but it's really bothering you almost kind,0.088717535
of like a pleasant bill sort of scenario and a lot of that first half,0.03943009
of the film is is kind of very much like a comedy of manners in,0.03822877
a lot of ways it reminded me of the film the invitation which I reviewed,0.026797589
last year and I mean this film is nowhere near as good as the invitation,0.045026947
at least in my opinion but it had this kind of this cheekiness about it,0.087503575
and this kind of forced facade of wholesomeness on the surface but in this film's,0.029824173
case it has that very bitter sour feel underneath of resentment and defensiveness from Rosa's,0.027686939
family against Chris roses parents also have a black maid and a black gardener and,0.010966217
the two of them there's something very off but they look almost like caricatures of,0.0432376
themselves at the same time they look like they could just snap at any time,0.15830639
in it's eerie but it's also as I said very satirical this movie reminds me,0.029663865
of something like the Stepford Wives which you know is partial parody and partial social,0.025493164
commentary but my favorite scenes are the scenes that involve the family and Chris in,0.00778664
some way all of those earlier scenes the ones like the dinner scene that happens,0.04938789
their very first dinner scene or there's a big party scene later on the scene,0.05823683
where Rosa's father takes Chris on a tour of the house and again all of,0.019721365
these moments are trying to reveal that thin line between what should scare you and,0.04715886
what should make you laugh and sometimes that can be hard to pinpoint all while,0.04459657
making the racial repression feel very culturally poignant and it's very cringe inducing to watch,0.28161207
at times and that's that's the point and I think that teetering between humor and,0.02772419
discomfort is Peale's sweet spot that's working really I would say excels in terms of,0.05004842
his writing ability but I think he so has many areas that he could improve,0.06143104
on I think that he has a real struggle with tonal shift he doesn't really,0.031598885
know how to establish a tone in the horror aspects but I also think this,0.025118664
is his first movie and he is still trying to establish his directorial style and,0.01764466
that's something that he'll learn with experience he'll learn to convey his point of view,0.046016075
in a more sharp way visually as well as through the content because for me,0.03114656
I feel like the content of this film is a bit too pointed at times,0.05908028
for me what is really strong especially in satire is when you distinguish the difference,0.03259932
between the black and the white and you focus more on the ambiguity on the,0.055575427
gray area and this film to me it relies a little bit too heavily on,0.061053216
more of the easy conceits and things that are right on the nose rather than,0.049880125
getting you to think for yourself ever due to movie a couple of years ago,0.05021205
called the sweet blood of Jesus and that was Spike Lee's crack at a horror,0.1980744
comedy through the African American experience and well I feel that get out is a,0.13115825
much much more focused film and in terms of the narrative imitates flow I mean,0.03727556
sweet blood of Jesus is a mess it's a complete mess but at the same,0.41615528
time I feel like Spike Lee obviously has much more artistry and much more of,0.031010196
a point of view in terms of his directing style and even though I had,0.017158411
tons of problems with that movie I still really enjoyed it and I liked the,0.049120486
way that it handled ambiguity it took its themes into darker more interesting places and,0.019164607
I have to give him credit for at least trying that I feel like get,0.017304752
out starts to fall especially in the third act of the film past the halfway,0.06674719
point but more in the third act of the film it starts to fall into,0.01832714
a lot of those obvious traps when it could have opened those ideas up for,0.060972065
more exploration and I didn't like the direction that they decided to take the film,0.019342875
in because it lost so much of what made it special by kind of settling,0.029486926
into the genre conventions in a way that to me just wasn't nearly as interesting,0.08680713
as the first half and one of the big problems I notice and I got,0.04135114
to be careful here because I don't want to go into spoilers because this movie,0.021198738
it's very hard not to give away spoilers but what to me is so important,0.056603137
in a movie any movie I don't care what it is is strong motivation from,0.030151444
both sides obviously you have a protagonist and an antagonist in a typical story and,0.027170757
I think that you need to have motivations from each one that's what makes characters,0.021180777
more complex when you understand their reasoning for why they're doing what they do and,0.02859691
that's what separates the more interesting films from the films that decide to go more,0.022268353
the cut-and-dry hero villain good bad scenario I think there are two or three major,0.04922359
characters in this film and again I'm not going to give away which ones but,0.023077216
I feel like there we needed to see why they were doing what they're doing,0.03256606
rather than just seeing them as as as a movement of chaos and of hatred,0.14990114
when we understand their motivations that again makes them more complex but also makes it,0.015510087
more eerie because then you can kind of understand where they're coming from and sometimes,0.055211574
that can be a hard thing to deal with thinking wow I can empathize or,0.06266629
maybe sympathize with someone that I don't agree with and that can be difficult but,0.038447615
it also gives the film in the story more dimension and I wanted it to,0.018644432
go there but regardless of my criticisms I actually think this is a fun time,0.05944214
at the movies I think that people definitely should see it just go see it,0.03689973
with a bunch of friends have fun and then talk about it afterwards because that's,0.03640683
the key I think that this is it's so important for a film like this,0.026548145
to be coming out from the african-american point of view directed by a black man,0.4753052
and written by a black man we need more of that in the mainstream we,0.29511023
just need more filmmakers in the mainstream that have more diversity more diverse stories because,0.039213907
that's going to help us grow in terms of what we are willing to accept,0.018935118
because obviously people are known for kind of staying in their little bubbles and not,0.06261706
wanting to try anything new or accept anything that is new so when you can,0.043570194
really cross over into a horror film which again is a big mainstream sort of,0.07916617
thing that can be I think extremely important and that is my review thank you,0.023677876
