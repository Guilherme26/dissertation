howdy so after a rough week and we're not even going to get into that,0.04090347
I decided yesterday to go with my wife to see the movie arrival at the,0.025362788
theater down in Syracuse and I want to give basically a quick review about it,0.118980065
you know it's not the movie I thought I was going to see when I,0.032943886
saw the previews and saw that it was going to be aliens and such I,0.06508157
thought wow this is going to be really cool because I love aliens so we,0.054322224
went we went to a matinee showing of it and they don't have it in,0.027068984
3d or imax and initially I wondered why and now I know why since I,0.02263354
saw the movie anyway it stars Amy Adams and jeremy renner and Forest Whitaker and,0.043295473
in essence aliens have come to visit earth and they're spread out over the earth,0.11582111
in 12 different locations not in major cities but in just 12 locations and we're,0.023197614
trying to find out why and Forest Whitaker plays a captain I believe who goes,0.030645676
in scouts Amy Adams character who happens to be a language expert to try to,0.013068863
get her to come and help them figure out how to communicate with the aliens,0.1544357
to find out why they're there and that's basically in the entire movie in essence,0.05786765
they've got the same thing going on in all the other locations so everyone is,0.019710056
trying to find you know their own way of communicating and she turns out to,0.032210186
do the best job of it she's able to figure out that they use certain,0.031209087
symbols that look like smoke to communicate and she's able to figure out what the,0.07070104
words and meanings mean she takes some risks in order to get there and of,0.039925653
course that that was kind of cool to see and it was really neat it,0.03479642
was visually a very nice movie I have to tell you that I'm not sure,0.03590595
about everything else the aliens okay I'm just going to say the aliens will remind,0.070393726
you of the hand character from The Addams Family that's the best I got but,0.01772515
still I like the movie and you know she does figure out the language and,0.034046758
she figures out the meaning and she figures out why they there and I've seen,0.06271418
some other reviews where folks are saying okay I'm confused I don't really understand everything,0.02790645
that's going on and I'm not going to tell you everything because I met those,0.043684606
you know I'm not the guy who wants to really spoil it for everybody but,0.03937754
what I am going to tell you is that you have to pay attention to,0.028164541
everything that's being said in essence think about time time for us basically says you're,0.040308133
born you go through your life you age and then a certain point you expire,0.2909025
well quantum physics basically says that time is a constant there is no beginning there,0.030749444
is no end in essence time is always the same so the beginning middle and,0.021780109
end of time is all happening at the exact same time so that's a very,0.019156624
important aspect to try to figure out in this movie and once you kind of,0.059542585
understand that then the rest of the movie starts to make sense with everything that's,0.014865524
going on whereas she gained some insight she gained some insight there's something that the,0.037608154
aliens are going to do that no one wants me Oh some people might say,0.11313909
well wait how did they know to do that well because of time I think,0.020310717
and I don't want to give it away so what i am gonna say is,0.03182438
amy adams you know what that woman is a stunning woman itch i have liked,0.26602525
everything I've ever seen her in I have not seen everything she's ever done because,0.040844273
I don't usually chase actors into movies I will you know if a movie seems,0.057590935
to catch my attention then I'll go see it but she's been solid and everything,0.068285756
I've ever seen her in Jeremy Renner was a little bit different than what I,0.064574696
expected you know I'm used to him being kind of bold and kind of smug,0.11969181
and in this movie he's supposed to be a dwell he's supposed to be a,0.027014438
genius guy and he's got a little bit of smugness but he really plays a,0.030496676
much secondary character and I have to say that for once they really let a,0.021990972
woman run the movie and i love that forest whitaker's character was really interesting because,0.054849047
if it had benefit for the fact that we know what Forest Whitaker looks like,0.037817687
when you hear his voice you're like okay what's he trying to affect you know,0.045573726
what is that voice it's not like that strong Forest Whitaker voice that were used,0.042646255
to but it's still Forest Whitaker everyone in essence played their roles the way I,0.050425578
would expect that we would do that in real life especially if you have aliens,0.1603811
all around the world and you have different countries with different cultures deciding that maybe,0.023367235
they have to do something different than what someone else might say and if you're,0.033726808
not communicating information with everybody you know things will start to happen or possibly happen,0.06763787
so like I said I thought that this movie was pretty cool if you're looking,0.051600955
for a lot of action this ain't it and truthfully I will tell you if,0.040693276
this movie hadn't looked like there would be some kind of action or something I,0.054262355
might not have ever gone but I'm glad I did so this is a rival,0.046444453
and I hope it does well it's still going up against dr. Strangelove and trolls,0.21169668
trolls yet anyway still going up against those movies I liked it my wife thought,0.13513471
it was okay someone else who went with us thought it was okay and one,0.07795354
other person he didn't like it because he said he likes more action hey you,0.048364174
know what movies don't appeal to everybody but still I think this movie deserves to,0.044464868
be seen I hope you go see it I think it's worth it I'm not,0.08596368
going to say that you're going to have as good a time as i had,0.061443012
at captain america civil war but i thought the movie was pretty good there are,0.11136172
some times there where the movie kind of slows down a little bit but it's,0.11555371
interesting in the fact that you probably needed some of that to get an understanding,0.028714648
of some of what was going on and there's a lot of flashbacks in the,0.021182109
movie that if you remember what I said about time you will understand how come,0.031173166
they're there so that's all I got I hope you all go see this movie,0.12462016
I hope you enjoy the movie when you see it and I hope this doesn't,0.0413997
look as odd as it looks to me filming it while sitting on my livingroom,0.041133627
