two hours and its stars probably not gonna saying these names right no Emmy Merle,0.036421467
aunt Adele hen L Luana Boz Rami will give those a shot there you go,0.20854904
the description of this is on an isolated island in Brittany at the end of,0.039161358
the 18th century a female painter is obliged to paint a wedding portrait of a,0.038834088
young woman this is portrait of a lady on fire well I am doing a,0.27086768
review of this movie but that doesn't exactly mean that I liked this movie or,0.03560462
any movies like this I am usually against watching movies with subtitles I usually don't,0.043048024
have the patience for it I you know I can't just sit and watch two,0.022199174
hours of reading a movie it's not what I watch movies for it's for entertainments,0.0397394
for to be interested in something you know it's to be invested in an idea,0.02721732
or watch a cartoon or watch an action scene or something I don't watch movies,0.08701999
to read subtitles it's just not what I do so when I sat down and,0.037309486
I started reading this movie last week or last night I'm sorry when I started,0.025340836
into it and I was reading the subtitles I was like you know what I've,0.031958748
been meaning to watch this movie for a while because it's been on my list,0.0371086
I know people have you know been suggesting it I know what it's about it,0.01986837
sounds interesting now maybe there won't be so much talking because it's about a lady,0.05216769
painting and I thought maybe it'll be fine so that's my overall opinion about this,0.03765405
movie after watching it is that yes it has sometimes the whole time but there,0.012289933
is a lot going on with the painting with interactions that you can kind of,0.08013334
tell what's going on even if you weren't to watch the subtitles whatsoever but honestly,0.05446457
you know for future use of this video in this times of the virus I,0.08163998
just kind of felt like toughing my way out through this movie because it has,0.029218856
been on my list and I wanted to watch the whole thing - people say,0.09994717
I've seen it and that's another reason why I decided to tough it out last,0.03056652
night - so as you get going in this I don't know maybe other people,0.056263227
are like me where they don't really like the subtitle movies as you go through,0.027649023
this it gets more interesting and you kind of know what's coming it's pretty predictable,0.05728495
and it's of an olden time and it's of a story one person's story in,0.019700743
history and it's a nice love story I guess and it has some other things,0.030002443
happen that are of intrigue and it has pretty dry characters you know I mean,0.044673733
they're talking what French or I think there's a little bit of Italian than in,0.09684542
this also but it's it's fine it's a fine movie if this were made in,0.030782038
English like I would have preferred it probably would be a little bit of you,0.114915796
know maybe a high school movie where people are you know they only have the,0.03819285
summer to really enjoy themselves and they just are meaning to talk to each other,0.015908532
but they are getting around to it in the last couple months that they have,0.018393658
available so I mean it's a very generic movie in that sense that the reason,0.031127268
why it was made was because of one person's experience in history they had this,0.024864566
person that they liked while they were doing a job and then that's it you,0.035834774
know that's that's the end of movie so it's it I don't know why we,0.030776717
keep making movies like this and why people think this is interesting but you know,0.06756004
I guess it's a kind of a life lesson you know for people to stop,0.10589524
waiting until the last second to tell somebody that they like them it's at the,0.02423663
reason why we keep getting movie after movie after movie of this idea where you,0.03448046
know I don't know you know I Netflix and theatres alike get the same movie,0.028189817
just in different forms so portrait of a lady on fire it has four main,0.108788125
characters and maybe a cast of thirty people you know not too bad not too,0.032246772
big of a main necessary people that are around it's a little slow because it's,0.10579347
only these three to four ladies in this house at a time there's some nice,0.03648599
walks on the beach where in the ocean where it's very pretty scenery the painting,0.02941708
by this lady that is the main character of the movie which is doing the,0.05054531
painting she has some nice artwork she gives some nice lesson she knows what she's,0.10741186
doing she shows her expertise you know there's good interaction between her and the housemaid,0.05760956
that's nice you know to paint out kind of you know some human characteristics they,0.062123496
weren't just completely stuck-up they addressed the issue of being a woman versus a man,0.058818866
you know there's there's some nice elements to it as far as that goes it's,0.02751133
not why I watch the movie but it kind of came out so can I,0.042836495
suggest it sure you know go ahead and go watch it a lot of people,0.04341587
watch these subtitle movies a lot of people are interested in this kind of a,0.082982324
movie with the painting and the scenery and all this stuff and sure you know,0.020324687
it's it's worth the watch if you're up for that and you have two hours,0.036535878
to waste and you want to get involved and you know this movie was out,0.08631357
in theaters somewhere I think I might have seen it at one of the smaller,0.020089876
theaters while the while they were still open and everything but I just didn't have,0.025394715
the urge to go see it in theatres for sure and I'm just kind of,0.032311294
happy I saw I'm not really excited that I saw it or anything like that,0.038192183
but I'm just glad I saw it so it's out of the way I'm gonna,0.05040961
get portrait of a lady on fire on see rating and I just can't get,0.22791573
that excited about it for you you're gonna have to see yourself and kind of,0.109273046
see what I mean that is kind of a bland movie it's kind of a,0.12920327
bland story and reading some titles is no but no fun for anybody so if,0.03031774
there is a subtitle movie out there that I have to watch let me know,0.04864089
maybe I can tough my way through it if I can find it I'll give,0.02336258
it a try but this is probably one of the better ones that I have,0.021240644
seen since I sat through the whole thing I enjoyed it you know I'd say,0.039620332
it was fine so I think I could give a lot of subtitled movies a,0.05774526
really low grade because I just don't care and I can't get invested in them,0.0691179
and a lot of them I just stopped it after half an hour if I,0.060707986
think it's completely boring after a half an hour so I see for portrait of,0.04308993
