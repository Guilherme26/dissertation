I have always heard about the Marx Brothers I've always seen little parodies of them,0.02747807
in a lot of TV shows I love like Animaniacs and pinky in their brain,0.31014368
they're just a part of American culture and I had very limited exposure to them,0.12940815
and now that I saw a Night at the Opera I'm quite sad that I,0.026741048
didn't grow up with him because they are so fun and there's a knee and,0.051674128
their comedy you find bits of it here and there that are dated bits that,0.12515363
you know I just didn't get jokes that were over my head or referenced things,0.055890724
that aren't part of our culture anymore but by and large I would say 99,0.059998233
percent of their humor is still just as good today as it was back then,0.014848894
and especially they come from the Depression era and you know where we've just come,0.034290217
out of this really really big recession I think a lot of their their jokes,0.06604675
about money and and things like that really really play to us now in a,0.024169447
very similar way to the way it did to them to people back then so,0.04302208
one of the first things that you should know about the Marx Brothers is their,0.01760209
movies are not for everyone this is however one of the first movies that they,0.029468967
did that really had some meat to it before their act was very vaudeville different,0.061760306
little scenarios that they would put together and travel around with this was one of,0.023031984
the first movies they did that actually had a significant plot real story to it,0.021127563
if you've ever seen Looney Tunes Animaniacs tiny to any of those types of shows,0.16562408
you've seen references to this movie probably a lot of them almost every bit of,0.07298062
humor in all of those cartoons comes right out of this movie they do everything,0.044426285
you could even think to do with the Opera House as their playground they go,0.07189172
up the fly system they fly on the backdrops they do all sorts of crazy,0.17028369
stunts on the set one of my favorite moments as they replace the music and,0.049586114
all the musicians stands one of the things that I love about this movie and,0.04305401
about the Marx Brothers in general is they each fill their own niche Groucho has,0.018117607
a really sarcastic sense of humor do you follow me yes well stop following me,0.02880844
all have your essence Chico really has all of his own his own little language,0.090803556
his own little accent that he does and he can do puns he can do,0.05184042
just different plays on words and things it's all right that's in every contract that's,0.02118743
what they call a sanity clause hahahahaha you can't fool me there ain't no sanity,0.102426976
clause Harpo does the physical comedy because he never actually speaks everything he does is,0.040161792
over the top physical overly comedic it's amazing something I love about the Marx Brothers,0.034423918
is the speeches that usually Groucho miss although really any time he or Chico give,0.021425566
a speech it is hilarious come on I tell you how we fly to America,0.086136624
the first time I we started we get a half way of course when we,0.02019431
run outta gasoline and we got to go back but joy be unconfined let me,0.07888679
be dancing in the streets drinking in the saloons and necking in the parlor but,0.054978758
one of the other truly significant things about these brothers is that they're all super,0.028554339
talented musically they all do really great things they don't always utilize that in their,0.02705834
movies but they are amazing when you sit them down with their instrument that they're,0.08846676
really good at there's a song that Harpo plays and I'm not a hard player,0.02491911
but I've never seen the harp used the way he used it it was really,0.01869033
really neat there's a little gag number they do on the piano that again it,0.056084294
was just it was musical humor it's in a way i'd never seen it's very,0.02432776
very smart but it's also incredibly impressive they're not phoning it in they're not giving,0.026304686
it half of their effort they are totally bringing intense talent to every minute of,0.04066201
those musical numbers and it's it's fabulous one of my favorite scenes is the contract,0.02835678
scene Groucho and Chico are talking about contracts for their clients and what to include,0.020028679
and what not to include and that's really where you get to see how well,0.019256402
they're different types of humor connect how well they can play off of each other,0.024857247
while Groucho is being very dry and very sarcastic you have Chico who is doing,0.05234596
the play on words and that scene I've never seen anything quite like it where,0.028425293
two people were doing two different styles of comedy and it was working so well,0.052490972
it was connecting so well a big favorite of most everybody who's seen this movie,0.02111825
is the stateroom scene it's called that because he has this little tiny cabin on,0.096607946
a cruise ship and it's a statement and so grouchos in there and both of,0.13888237
the other Marx Brothers and this one other guy in the story they they snuck,0.043980613
in in his giant suitcase so they're in there and he orders dinner so then,0.06276806
you get waiters coming in and you get somebody coming in to check the temperature,0.13750477
and then you get the assistant to come in and check the temperature and you,0.028411323
get somebody coming in to give a manicure and every single person that comes you,0.2361043
keep thinking Groucho is going to say no no we're full but you keep saying,0.035376463
come on in come on in come on in and by the time it's all,0.09615762
said and done there's absolute chaos in the room I think they said there were,0.027340379
more than 15 people in that room all at the same time overall I would,0.116918
give a Night at the Opera five stars it's really great fun it has a,0.029205553
really nice little story a really happy ending ties up nicely I think overall I,0.13664669
think anybody can enjoy this movie as great as this movie is it's not perfect,0.062196
it's got its flaws some of the more technical flaws you'll see blips in the,0.026389165
film from time to time just because that's the way movies were made back then,0.022278996
and I guess they didn't have enough coverage so there are several of those that,0.017341338
happen throughout but as far as the content of the film it is just it's,0.021360377
fantastic I would give it between four and five stars I'm gonna say four stars,0.025777197
just because there's a few places right in the middle where it kind of was,0.026531516
a little a little slow and the story kind of disappeared for a few minutes,0.12100888
but because of tomorrow's brothers the fact i had a story it all was amazing,0.021031111
so I give it 4 stars but i really want to give it 5 they,0.017801644
went and they toured this show as a vaudeville act first to see how audiences,0.033058964
would react to it and then they made revisions to the script as they went,0.026119767
to see what what plate and what didn't play and as you hear about scenes,0.013663537
that were cut and scenes that were kept it becomes apparent how effective that was,0.032391116
as a way to sort of preview the show I in fact the state room,0.033378914
scene which is again it's one of the most classic scenes in the movie if,0.034996644
not in all cinema was going to be cut it just wasn't playing wasn't playing,0.114472784
wasn't playing with the audiences and then one night Groucho ad lived the entire scene,0.03216562
his part of the entire scene and the audience just was dying and that ultimately,0.038367793
is the version that ended up in the movie they wrote down what he said,0.03168935
this film is considered a classic even by our government it's in the national film,0.06230376
registry it was actually adopted in in 1993 in case you don't believe me that,0.042094816
this movie is amazing even by today's standards it currently has a ninety-seven percent rating,0.037938748
on rotten tomatoes that's better than probably most anything you've seen in years the two,0.0629144
leads in this movie who are actually the opera singers that the whole film kind,0.029099789
of revolves around are not actually singers but they sing for themselves which was kind,0.030597117
of unique for the day to get two people to sing such intense music who,0.0382893
weren't actual professional singers one story that I heard before I ever saw this movie,0.017557522
that really kind of sold me on the Marx Brothers humor was they made a,0.035274025
movie called a night in casablanca and over a Warner Brothers they heard they were,0.05693972
doing this and they wanted to sue them because Casablanca and so they sent them,0.155645
this letter the cease-and-desist letter and gruff Joe sent them back a letter and he,0.088205345
said I would just like to congratulate warner brothers on their acquisition of the town,0.039364904
of Casablanca I didn't realize you owned the rights to the whole city consequently we'd,0.0412793
like to counter sue you because we were the Marx Brothers before you were the,0.06678909
Warner Brothers and we'd like to sue you for using part of our name in,0.08848406
your studio and consequently Warner Brothers did not send any reply and the suit was,0.049779683
dropped many of you who enjoy the Marx Brothers sense of humor on the screen,0.07984731
might like to know that they had kind of a similar personality off the screen,0.0734968
when they were called in to their producers office for a meeting and he was,0.027927736
running late they ended up taking off all of their clothes and piling up all,0.117040396
of his office furniture up by his fireplace like as they were burning it to,0.10763137
keep warm he ended up being about three hours late for that meeting but he,0.054890953
