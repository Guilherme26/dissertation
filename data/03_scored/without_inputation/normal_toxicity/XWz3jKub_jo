well that broke my heart what is up flick fans and welcome back to my channel today,0.062942185
we are talking about one of my most anticipated movies of the last couple of months it,0.06456215
finally came to a theater near me,0.11590964
we are talking the farewell,0.05412802
I need your comments down below did you enjoy this movie let's talk about it,0.27018625
so a Chinese family discovers their grandmother has only a short while left to live and decide to keep her in the dark scheduling a wedding together before she dies and oh my goodness a 24,0.25853994
one of my favorite Studios out there you delivered an emotional gut punch a movie that handles atmosphere and tone I think better than anything I have seen all year,0.11539372
and one that broke me,0.10981349
I said this on Twitter I normally tweet out reviews right after I see the movie I had to sit back and wait for about 30 minutes and just kind of ponder on what I just watched not because there is a lot to soak in and think about all,0.06482478
what happened here,0.0664572
and here the story is very simple,0.07327278
it's all about a family who comes together to basically celebrate their grandmother without telling her why they are there to celebrate it's all covered up by this wedding and that really is it's the premise of this movie it carries out until the end and like I said this is just such an emotional experience,0.07289768
if you have ever lost a loved one if you have ever had a grandmother or grandfather in particular who was a major part of your lives,0.24033134
then maybe they begin to lose their memory or they get cancer or something happens that normally happens to people that reach that age and are maybe not in the best of health or maybe they are in the best of health but they get to that point in their lives and your body it just continues to wither down as you get older and when you hit that age that's when hearts begin to break and things start to happen to your loved ones and listen,0.22996509
here's one of the reasons why I felt the way that I felt about this movie I'll get into,0.08010139
all of the brilliance of the filmmaking here in just a second but just a personal story,0.05811585
so my grandmother who I grew up with and I saw basically every weekend of my life for 10 to 12 years last year she was put in a nursing home because she had a health scare she got dementia and she fell all those things kind of added up to the fact that she had to leave her home go into that nursing home,0.24155161
she's about three hours away from me right now and it feels like every time I go to see her I lose a bit more of her and my entire family feels the same way,0.15248255
and it comes down to the most recent time when we saw her she had trouble recognizing me she had trouble recognizing my wife my dad calls she doesn't know which brother it is it's just a very it's a complicated situation and the entire time I was watching this movie I felt what awkwafina's character felt in this situation,0.097380646
it is a different situation from hers because in this movie she has cancer and the cancer is so bad it's at a stage to where they don't think they can really do anything about this,0.1550407
and they decide to keep that from her so she's all happy and giddy and just excited to see everyone her her whole family is finally gathered back from America from here from there,0.17195398
everyone is here right,0.055406816
and then you have Aquafina who is the one that is struggling,0.13248461
the most with not telling her,0.20900324
what is actually wrong with her,0.15287079
this is a Chinese tradition,0.091774866
and one thing I loved about this movie is how it handled traditions traditions from families in general gathering around the dinner table talking laughing joking around those things you love doing when you go and you visit your family whether it's a brother a sister a grandma a cousin whatever,0.0868186
it is I have that with my family but they partook in all of those things,0.08309238
and while that was going on you see it kind of fluster in the back of everyone's head it starts out just aquafina,0.23957026
she's the only one that's kind of freaking out then it slowly transfers to everyone else in the situation and to see that progress and to see even the people who at the beginning of the movie were like we can't tell her no matter what we do by the end of the film,0.32298625
they're sitting back going,0.05299031
I don't know I it's a confliction that I saw progressing every single character and there was not a bad performance,0.079847254
I had no issue with the script when it came to side characters dialogue from her parents to her actual grandma to her grandma sister to her uncle's to her aunts the conversations every thing it led towards developing each and every character,0.094243705
and even the characters who maybe I didn't know their name you could still see the emotion within them,0.037200425
especially when everything comes to the head at the end of the movie the eventual wedding not spoiling anything,0.2084953
because it's in the trailer,0.056217782
but yeah it's just a story that I think is going to rock a lot of people to their core especially if you can relate to it in some way and it doesn't have to be a grandparent it can really be anyone in your family or a friend you can connect with this situation,0.0860304
now let's get into the filmmaking because that's the reason listen,0.103932366
if all of that stuff that I just talked about worked really,0.052558932
well I would say yeah I like this movie a lot I enjoyed it,0.13916537
but you pair that with this filmmaking the cinematography it felt like every shot had a purpose,0.24153529
everything was laid out so well and I know there's a lot of hype around the farewell,0.09035222
and I it's got a nine and an around tomatoes it's gonna be eight listen,0.14414646
I kind of bought the hype I'm like yeah this could be really good,0.10231885
I didn't expect it to hit me,0.1486399
I didn't anticipate getting emotional in the theater,0.053081416
and I did I got emotional,0.03942368
I sat back at the end and watched every ounce of credits without saying a word moving touching my phone anything,0.08738998
I just sat and soaked it all in because it was such an emotional experience and Aquafina everyone in this movie is good they carry their weight,0.10508734
they bring in the emotion,0.08281272
and it's so funny because all this movie is it's just a lot of conversation,0.1265653
it's a lot of learning about this family and the struggle that they have with each other the struggle that they have with decisions that they made in the past and the struggle that they have with this particular decision that's all the movie is,0.042593695
so if you're expecting action or adventure or something crazy or Aquafina to jump off of a building you're not gonna get that the farewell is exactly what you think it's going to be it's just executed in the best way possible and back to Aquafina who is magnificent,0.3943697
I mean right now possibly one of my favorite performances of the year she is broken,0.11370352
when she needs to be broken,0.24252564
she is incredibly incredibly emotional on a level that I didn't anticipate,0.32768852
I know she's funny she's done funny before and she's done it,0.2396181
well,0.039254032
this is something else,0.06309986
this is something that,0.06206473
I didn't think I would see out of her she is magnificent and that mixed with this script mixed with the direct by lulu Wang who first time making a movie hopefully this is not the last time I hope you get every opportunity from here on out a wonderful job incredibly slick direction awesome cinematography with the score and the score was just haunting in a sense,0.17134362
and when they took away the score from certain scenes and you just sit there in silence and wonder with the characters what is going to happen,0.12521234
next it just felt,0.090150885
so real it kind of felt like at times watching a documentary of a family that's experiencing a trouble like this,0.101221584
and because of all of those things coming together mixed with the a24 package,0.11326165
so you know it's going to be an artistic film,0.10754587
and yes it is a bit artistic,0.21138391
but I do think this is an artistic film that is family-friendly,0.07794118
it's only PG but it's family-friendly and heartbreaking and emotional,0.06304793
and it is a crowd-pleaser,0.14899628
all of these thing I mean how rare is it that you get a movie this crowd-pleasing yet its artistic and wonderfully made,0.13480861
and the farewell for me is just,0.051174853
it's a great move,0.047408435
it is a great movie one of the best movies I have seen all year,0.02779913
and one of my absolute favorites,0.10218387
I have to go,0.037556615
you know what I was planning on going somewhere with my score,0.10839391
I'm going even higher I'm going 96% for the farewell one of the highest scores,0.056519285
I have given all year,0.020387521
I place it on my list,0.0958787
I'm actually gonna move it up a bit higher because I the more I think about this movie more I get emotional,0.19003342
the more that I absolutely love it,0.061674908
I feel the same way I felt about eighth grade last year a 24 movie I walked out of that film feeling emotional happy entranced this movie wasn't feeling as happy but it does end on a note that makes you smile sit back and go I need to call my grandmother and tell her that I love her or just a family member in general so that's my review of the farewell,0.10312555
