today on the channel,0.059005987
I'm going to be reviewing a movie called the farewell,0.06829439
but if I'm being honest and not to be too on-the-nose about it,0.13964152
but it's also time for another farewell in the channel and you guys aren't gonna like it get some good memories you guys are gonna miss it I'm gonna miss it,0.10048606
but gotta give the people what they want what are you talking about before,0.087387875
oh yeah did the farewell right,0.09875921
so they're gonna do review for that okay,0.065909475
so you've seen that now it's time to move on to more important stuff,0.08810642
farewell is a movie that is directed by Lulu Wang or Lulu Wong,0.07081401
I think it's Lulu Wang it stars aquafina and Zima Azim I still know him as Chang from 24th rat-bastard the concept behind the story is kind of interesting aquafina stars as a young woman who's been living in america for a while now she and her parents actually had been living in America for over 20 years they she gets the very bad news that her grandmother the matriarch of the family is dying,0.5492893
and she's not going to be around,0.24181582
anymore,0.060949292
she's suffering from some kind of cancer or something,0.55298656
she also finds out that the rest of her family has decided not to tell the grandmother that she's dying they all know that she's dying,0.3205156
she doesn't know that she's dying and no one else in the family is going to tell her kind of wedding that's planned in China,0.25813016
and this is really just an excuse to get the family together,0.051103227
so that they could say goodbye basically to the grandmother again does not know that she is dying,0.2437148
but everyone else knows that she is and they have to try to keep this from her and this becomes a bigger moral issue for everyone in the family the longer the film goes on I like movies where I can go into a movie,0.068176046
and there's a sense of discovery with it because I discovered some things while watching this movie mostly that I'm an ignorant American who doesn't understand how other cultures work,0.59110105
I appreciate films that show me that other side of the culture that I'm missing that show me how other people do things and how that's different from the way Americans think,0.15197894
and the way that Americans do things on something the premise of this movie it just seems weird to American ears I saw the movie and I'm like okay,0.23395716
I don't get why they're not telling this woman that she's sick like wouldn't it make better sense to tell this woman so that you can prepare for us that everybody can build it up,0.5891895
everybody can say goodbye and she can feel like,0.05727686
she you know,0.07683236
she got a chance to say goodbye,0.08881186
this movie showed me a different side a different angle to that question it actually did present this as an actual moral dilemma in the movie not just for Aquafina character,0.06734295
but for the rest of the family in between those complicated family dynamics and the moral issue of telling somebody whether or not,0.054813717
they're going Dyanne whether that's going to affect the experience of spending your last moments with them,0.092909
it's really the emotional hook that got itself into me and kept me watching this movie because I gotta say this is one of my favorite film experiences of the year and it's a film experience,0.14932586
I did not expect going in as an American we're used to saying goodbye,0.10483958
we're used to it being a very emotional drawn-out thing,0.0894255
but this movie also does a very good job at pointing out some differences between the culture of America and the West and the culture of you know the east and some of the countries and places out there America it's all about you,0.089527406
it's all about doing,0.06935683
what's best for you and doing what's best for yourself,0.08415487
it's all about individualism and it's all about expression,0.05437851
it's all about being an individual,0.089219354
there are the ease they have a different mentality,0.13220908
everything that they do is,0.0499196
it's like one person is a part of a bigger whole,0.1747218
it's basically they're all for their family and all for society look at themselves as part of a cog in the system just fascinating to get inside that system and see how their minds work look at the way that some people look at it from the eastern side of things they're kind of like,0.061572183
well,0.039254032
actually you were part of a whole we're supposed to carry that grief for them,0.10752529
so that they don't have to,0.07151458
so that's why we decided not to tell them about like the fact that this movie reflected,0.09354575
this is a very balanced issue,0.09194721
because honestly it's an issue,0.1495485
that has a lot of Merit to both sides say this is one of the most compelling watches of the years,0.056941725
it's not just about this film and the themes and the ideas that it's dealing with but also the emotion and the family at its core,0.048787963
it's a movie that could have been about,0.07469224
so many things in fact in a lot of ways,0.14150473
it is about a lot of things,0.06342163
but it kept its focus on the things that mattered,0.061263606
the shoutout Aquafina aquafina was sensational in this movie normally when I see Aquafina in a movie I'm like okay,0.08724101
he's just there to be the funny person,0.12334814
she's just there to carry the comic relief portion know in this movie she wasn't just the funny person like her character had a lot of depth to her character had a lot of range,0.098286495
and as an actress she displayed that range in full display for everybody to see performance like this definitely makes me more interested to see Aquafina and more serious dramatic roles because she definitely proved in this movie she can pull it off all the performances in the movie feel very real all of the writing for these characters feels very authentic the film that also has gorgeous lighting and cinematography,0.059981164
I don't know if it was shot on location,0.18726012
but I like the fact that they made everything look really beautiful in this movie especially when they were in China whether or not to tell somebody whether they're dying and what that will do for you and what that will do for them,0.18714148
how the characters in this movie,0.072141394
don't know how to react around this woman because they know that she's gonna die,0.7238707
now there's an undercurrent of tension and emotion woven into every scene because every character that's in a scene with her feels like this is one of their final scenes one of their final times they're ever going to get to spend with really appreciated the direction and the approach by the director I really appreciated the execution of the performances the musical score the cinematography,0.103060134
mostly I appreciate that they took a concept like this and they made it something that I can understand something that I can dissect from multiple perspectives,0.060722932
and I like movies that give me that sense of discovery give me that sense of perspective that I didn't have before really have minor nitpicks with the film,0.08744701
I do think that it got off to kind of a slow start like in the first 20 minutes it took me a little bit to get invested in things,0.15350737
do you think later on in the film there are some scenes that dry going a little bit unnecessarily,0.07472957
there is a wedding scene that takes place somewhere close to the third act,0.08895481
of this movie just went on for a little bit too long it felt a little bit self-indulgent,0.27529633
I'm gonna say farewell to the farewell and I'm gonna put it where it belongs on this channel in Superman Prime,0.111865774
I mean the truth you're gonna miss the Patriot hat go ahead,0.12056964
tell me in the comments section how much you're gonna miss it,0.06888504
and which hat is sexier this one or the Patriot Act come on you can tell me like it subscribe to the superfan show,0.35287982
and as always if you like what you see tell me how you feel and stay tuned to hear more from the Man of Steel,0.071059704
thanks,0.025407692
