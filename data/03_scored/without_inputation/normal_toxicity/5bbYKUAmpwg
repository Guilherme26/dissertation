- Dom BIA and stars Lisa I appreciate and marina de terraria and it starts,0.12433582
with a family and a housekeeper set in the Colonia Roma neighborhood in 1970 Mexico,0.055068556
City I'm going to talk about it right now so Roma is a ambitious movie,0.115004
which is a black-and-white film directed by Alfonso Curran and the film is a very,0.00017885228
slow pacing movie which takes you through the lives of family and the housekeeper for,0.16702409
about two years and one thing about this channel I'm going to do I'm not,0.14200686
going to involved spoilers in the beginning I will talk about some spoilers toward the,0.093687065
end but there will be a warning at the bottom but for now talk about,0.12279448
the movie itself and overall the movie is a slow burn it is all black,0.49079618
and white pan and scan and one shot takes so what you'll see is a,0.27738932
film where there would be a scene that goes on for maybe three to four,0.09580064
minutes and it's all one take and the camera will pan left to right slowly,0.11782885
and then back again and it's a very very unsettling approach because you're feeling like,0.08102986
you're a voyeur and it's like there's no tilt with the camera it's all pan,0.2424393
and scan mainly and the shots that are stable are tend to be behind things,0.10586182
or back off from the subject and you don't really quite see reactions and the,0.0759215
thing about the film is interesting is it's a very artsy film and you wonder,0.067013696
what this thing is going because it just deals with these people you kind of,0.1006698
have to really follow along it's in Spanish so you could have to read the,0.06254892
subtitles but of course when you do that after a while it becomes second nature,0.07295272
okay in the category of story or depth this movie doesn't really have a lot,0.06624523
of that is it's a lot of it cerebral and and a one out of,0.41204545
ten I had to give this movie a five in that regard because it's just,0.09510538
averaged it's a character development story with no clear plot direction it's just a life,0.080687396
of these people as it is over the course of a couple of years in,0.080736145
a category of emotional impact now this is probably where the movie is at the,0.053954586
strongest it's because without giving anything away through the first two acts of the movie,0.076900065
you're basically following this housekeeper mainly through her eyes and the family of the people,0.17705469
that she is attending and they get involved in things along the way that are,0.081607565
traumatic and you end up really feeling for these characters and identifying with these characters,0.08140916
so by the end of the third act when things start going crazy you start,0.4033863
really feeling that because you feel like they're part of your family and so in,0.08579651
this regard I give it an 8 out of 10 which is pretty high which,0.15259406
means there's a strong emotional pull and that's very important for a movie because if,0.048344903
it doesn't make you feel something then what's the point really you're watching it in,0.07848598
a category of intangibility z-- it's my term of putting the things that make movies,0.08015214
special in of themself I like bringing it movies like Footloose the original what a,0.14669129
movie really wasn't really good but because of the soundtrack and because some of the,0.070982784
dance scenes similarly to dirty dancing not really a great movie but because you have,0.5154597
a couple of good actors that we had to get chemistry on-screen and of course,0.07150259
the soundtrack makes the movie much better than it was and so he's probably call,0.071193025
the intangibles and it can vary from anything it can be a great direction it,0.072719984
can be great scene or so forth but this particular film I give it a,0.069923304
seven because it's a masterful film in terms of how it with shots how it,0.15947668
slits the pan and scan thing that it does constantly it's annoying but by the,0.113002166
third act you will understand with you quickly why it's doing that and it pays,0.15186727
off in the end it's really brilliant work of a camera movement you probably wouldn't,0.09850404
work on most films but for this one I think it was actually so yeah,0.1373127
so yeah I give a seven for intangibility in a category on watchability this is,0.07815277
word it's pretty weak because you see at one time you pretty much done I,0.2935264
give it a five now this could change in that area but I don't want,0.07578998
to rush back to watch this movie anytime soon so a 5-4 watch building my,0.08956652
overall rating which is a weighted average against the other four this is a really,0.09367748
big piece of it it's kind of when you see a movie what you feel,0.16665727
after you see it what's your overall impression I give it a 6 which is,0.09277382
better than average and so weight against the others the movie comes out in pretty,0.16412994
good footing my conservators take on Roma and by the way from here on out,0.1402441
we're gonna have the spoiler section here so if you don't wanna know anything about,0.15253006
the movie specifically just fast-forward to the end or check the time index and jump,0.06643569
above to where you want to go for the review in terms of my conservative,0.07041204
take on this film just that much booty to to be ball cat this movie,0.22692038
is based on the experiences from the director himself and so I don't have any,0.066016905
reason to give that a negative mark so for the most part I'm giving this,0.1658065
movie a green light the deal with the movie and the pan and scan toward,0.039017502
the end when the kids are in the ocean and they're about to drown you,0.4889699
don't know where they are and how pans off camera and comes back to them,0.25408453
that's probably the most important aspect of this film is the most powerful aspect to,0.056269642
this film and it kind of ties in all that direction toward the end and,0.06613207
so I think that over ways everything that the love of a housekeeper who had,0.15237921
her own problems with her miscarriage which by the way is a really really powerful,0.27041012
scene that if you don't get emotional in that then you probably don't have a,0.07649633
pulse a person who loves these kids as if they were her own and risks,0.18721522
her own life because she can't swim to save these kids that's that's that's the,0.2149942
movie that's that's the crux in the movie so my final take on this film,0.09398229
is a score of 12.5 which translates to three stars out of four or three-and-a-half,0.06711519
stars out of five so with that coming below if you like this movie did,0.10142078
you like it did you want to see you want to see it if you've,0.15740933
seen it and agree with me let me know or if you've seen it and,0.06310783
