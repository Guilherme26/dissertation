what is up guys do here and this weekend I went out and saw Lulu,0.1463874
Wang's affair well which is finally out here on UK screens it's been a little,0.09397441
while as usual a good film comes out in the US everyone goes a little,0.102275886
bit nuts for it gets low as it buzz and we just sort of sat,0.3649473
there waiting waiting on our little British arses but before we get into the juiciness,0.76818055
of today's review I wouldn't be a youtuber if I didn't ask you to subscribe,0.07536215
so if we can do that for me right now cheers mate now that's out,0.063830696
the way I guess we can talk about some films film singular it's only one,0.07497189
film it's the farewell so as I said it starts by Loulou Wang I've not,0.07250487
seen any of her work before as far as I'm aware this is like her,0.11456255
second feature film and essentially it's sort of based on real-life events that have happened,0.066651955
to her and her family premise of this one being is a family in China's,0.0664697
grandma finds out she has cancer or rather the family find out but don't want,0.25985274
to tell her because and I had absolutely no idea this was a custom in,0.07565224
China but apparently it's seen as a bad thing to tell someone of that age,0.15481901
that they're going to die they just rather let them live their life to the,0.48741806
fullest until they absolutely have to know so you have this weird kind of fake,0.44810662
wedding they have to set up to get her to come and see them home,0.16757905
it's an interesting premise and it leads to a very interesting film I was a,0.06372179
big big fan of this one it starts awkwafina in the lead role here and,0.079773396
I mean she crushes it she really does I've not seen a whole lot of,0.10655757
Aquafina x' work I think I saw her last in ocean's 8 and then a,0.10691309
couple of supporting roles here and there and so I'm not too well-versed on Aquafina,0.059092835
as an actress but she really did a good job here it's a sort of,0.16538523
performance which works best because it's not going for all these crazy big moments there's,0.4402249
no huge breakdowns or anything I hate saying it but it's a very real performance,0.26456884
which is the strongest compliment I reckon you can give to a performance in a,0.06758375
film like this because ultimately it needs to feel real to work and it does,0.063639544
so yeah aquafina did a great job and the rest of the cast of the,0.13338995
great job as well and it's also a testament to the writing of Lulu Wang,0.044633247
here who also writes as well as directs and the biggest compliment I can give,0.15744695
to the film is it a hundred percent feels like I'm watching a real family,0.050299082
interact the relationships on screen unfolding in exactly the same way I'd expect a real,0.06814282
family's relationship to unfold and that makes it just incredibly interesting and engaging to watch,0.07900234
it's always fun watching characters interact on screen it just feels like the normal way,0.053238373
characters wouldn't it doesn't feel like a very flashy out-there screenplay and doesn't need that,0.07292628
it's not going for that I have to give special props to the Nana in,0.06502081
this film I think I kind of fell in love with her and I would,0.15333201
like her to be my own Nana in real life I want her to read,0.23996623
me stories at bedtime goddamnit she's adorable and you immediately sort of fall in love,0.7962768
with her which in itself makes the whole rest of the film just work because,0.06295673
I can't help but feel like this film would have fallen a little bit flat,0.1604992
if you were thinking that grandma's a but the concept of the film this whole,0.06359178
idea that they don't want to tell the grandmother that she's dying so they have,0.2649302
to come up with this fabricated wedding to get away with getting everyone they know,0.12063043
together to say goodbye to her it's a really really interesting one and it works,0.107860595
really well in the film it's naturally kind of bittersweet premise in itself and you,0.08757344
can see how immediately that narrative lends itself quite well to being almost kind of,0.08744069
farcical with a lot of laugh and humor there and you can understand how it's,0.37637016
inevitably going to start hitting the fan and you're gonna start getting a little bit,0.5537738
teary I did both of it for me I found it to be funny when,0.06930796
it needs to be I also found it to be incredibly poignant and quite moving,0.11890397
when it needs to be as well and I think it comes down to the,0.10254034
fact that even though we're watching a Chinese family and it's set in China for,0.114157155
the most part and it's talking about Chinese customs and traditions the characters are written,0.06854135
well enough and the relationships are real enough to feel like you can relate to,0.036305867
almost anyone in this family because a granted depending on life experiences in age I'm,0.059114322
sure there's not one person here that hasn't ever worried about some of the love,0.102604054
passing away let alone had to go through some of their love passing away I,0.123436406
don't feel like it's a bit of a cop-out to criticize this film for not,0.11532547
ever being as amazing as other people making out to be but I do feel,0.16633163
like there are certain moments which could have landed better there are certain aspects of,0.03827001
it which I maybe wrongly was expecting to be a little bit more I don't,0.16194971
know flooring I guess it's probably not the right word at all a certain moments,0.074650034
I think could have been executed a little better and being a little bit more,0.6049771
effective for that one of those being the ending I really liked the ending I,0.08156416
thought it was a really strong ending and actually sort of that the bit leading,0.29665557
up to the ending I thought was really really well done I was crying so,0.0960719
it did something right but the very very ending of this film left me in,0.1306486
two minds don't go into too many details cuz I don't wanna spoil anything about,0.25905573
the film but one half of me thinks yeah it's really sweet the other half,0.0757337
of me thinks kinda a little bit cheesy a little bit obvious but I've said,0.27955186
it before and I'll say it again I don't really have a huge problem with,0.07891505
cheese I guess if it worked it worked and and Who am I they didn't,0.027729074
work because I had tears streaming down my face if it had cut maybe a,0.35734788
tiny bit earlier and and not showing us a little bit more I think it,0.24237943
would have been more beneficial for that I'll leave it at that it's a really,0.15308502
really solid film a laughed I cried enjoyed watching these characters on screen consider me,0.10794272
a loo doing fan now I'm totally on board for wherever she ends up doing,0.10104328
