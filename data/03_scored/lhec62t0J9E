I'm not gonna lie it was really hard to get myself to watch Romo i,0.18312721
sat down right after it came out on Netflix to try and watch it for,0.108595826
lunch and I finished my lunch before the credits ended the credits are very slow,0.08830519
without much reward so I was like this is taking too long it's a it's,0.09446688
a little bit too slow of a burn I'd say for the first half of,0.37414604
the movie the final thing that really got me to check it out though was,0.06558235
it's you know it's it's a warrants situation that it's just winning award after award,0.05663362
after award it has momentum and I imagine more and more people would be like,0.072900936
okay I gotta watch it right or maybe you'll be just on the edge like,0.11567707
I was and Here I am to give you that last push to tell you,0.09165476
that you should indeed watch it but it's gonna be tough you know you got,0.081589356
to know that going in because even once I started Romo it was hard to,0.081676915
finish it I took in fact several breaks but did the movies credit I did,0.066499844
watch it in a single day because the story did hook me and you know,0.1025176
what it wasn't even so much the story as I wanted to see what korone,0.083902225
was doing he's he's all over this and in more ways than just the usual,0.11943122
you know being the director in the filmmakers situations you're about to find out but,0.06563507
you know he seemed in control even if I felt I didn't love what he,0.089293
was doing so out of respect for him as an artist I was like well,0.18430097
let me see what you've got and I also wanted to see more of his,0.08280713
outstanding black-and-white cinematography cinematography made all the more impressive because quarren has never shot a,0.12826538
movie before he's a double in the cinematography before but Wow clearly you know just,0.12623875
being around such wonderful cinematographers throughout his career has really rubbed off on the guy,0.1548859
so good it's so good cinematography is amazing and on that note Rolla is an,0.08047454
intensely personal film for korone so much so that I would wager that watching Roma,0.09924592
is only half of the experience that he's put together here you need to know,0.08993472
her owns personal story behind the film the extraordinary almost unbelievable efforts that he went,0.050265767
through to recreate his childhood how and why he chose his cast especially his lead,0.24071266
actress and on top of all that the history of Mexico at the time not,0.15479846
just politically but also economically as well as race relations and I can imagine Alfonso,0.24073796
Cuaron talking to awards voters and explaining all of that what an awards campaign I,0.08374688
imagine it is captivating because I had a great time reading about it during the,0.05183547
movie and afterwards because I was like because I was like how is this autobiographical,0.09328799
I'd heard I'd heard a little bit about that you know the movie just wasn't,0.10005589
answering these questions for me so I had to go and find out although korone,0.0908668
has all my movies do during awards season is going to Awards voters and has,0.039944563
I am sure an amazing presentation and that's why it's doing so well during awards,0.059855502
season a lot of awards of voters know stuff that you do not and most,0.18407348
people who watch this movie will not know but I'm going to fix that for,0.113899
you I have links down below to two articles that I feel do the trick,0.1861131
and you can either read them before or after you watch the movie it's up,0.08752586
to you what kind of experience you want to have I highly recommend you read,0.16727404
them before you watch the movie I think you'll have a much better time and,0.16458218
be able to get through it in one sitting perhaps even enthusiastically so but either,0.056034666
way again this is more of a package situation than just a movie now I,0.055666897
personally feel that a film should stand on its own and I do think the,0.068043105
core own could have done a better job hinting at the bigger picture in the,0.05954207
film in itself I don't think it needs to have all this additional reading material,0.098911755
I think that you know lots of historical films have been able to allude to,0.06668998
the bigger picture within the context of the film I think his strokes and Roma,0.04805857
are too broad perhaps because he's too close to the material it actually happened to,0.10710165
him and his loved ones so he automatically knows what he's looking at and also,0.10681365
he can fill in the blanks whereas we who have no attachment to this material,0.15037489
cannot do that this is why filmmaking is supposed to be a team effort so,0.050841767
somebody can catch these things and be like quarrel and you're too close to the,0.10923091
material no one else is going to get this and it's why producers never do,0.06626487
directors any favors is interesting to have this conversation after talking about M night Shyamalan,0.17188388
on movie math yesterday uh you know producers don't do their directors any favors by,0.14235754
giving them total creative freedom that said though role is still hasn't awful lot going,0.11286602
for it and you know what I wasn't being like what else is going on,0.10195719
your Corona and furiously researching the movie you know during breaks I did appreciate it,0.19057976
from the perspective of what I do know going into the film and that's the,0.040883932
history of cinema and the feminist movement now on that first point the history of,0.12599275
cinema it is brilliant and impressive both from a creative perspective and a business standpoint,0.03117975
I mean it's so savvy when it comes to awards season I can't believe it,0.07285742
but korone has mimicked very very well French New Wave cinema and famous Italian black-and-white,0.011925895
films like Federico Fellini's eighth-and-a-half again it's all down to the black and white cinematography,0.105318435
absolutely stunning in fact I'm still thinking about it that's what stuck with me the,0.18851824
most about the movie 1960s Mexico depicted so sharply so cleanly and so vibrant Lee,0.07449676
that it just seems so alive I would also say on a side note that,0.08118794
I thought that cuar√≥n had an interesting directing style and it was a little absurdist,0.28432032
as well which I think not only you know points to these two these uh,0.15254323
you know movements in film French New Wave cinema and Italian black-and-white cinema but there,0.00017573604
is a tad voice Anderson in there too some like just really you know ironic,0.1377714
moments that really just got you you know I don't want to give any of,0.073746845
them away but that either also kind of kept me hooked and there were more,0.08416144
of those as the film went along but also movies even factored in to Roma's,0.04784756
story itself as the characters go to the movies frequently although a lot of times,0.044709317
not to actually watch the movie and in doing so they showcase some of the,0.0762717
truly beautiful movie houses that were the norm in the mid twentieth century there's one,0.037877657
in particular with the way the light from the projector lights up this movie theater,0.08818805
and there and you know there are characters that were with her in the back,0.050001573
so you can see the whole thing it's just gorgeous I loved it so much,0.11292541
and there's even a clip in the film from the 1960 movie maroon which the,0.07822082
characters go to see which instantly brought him up bring Stu mind when I was,0.12969485
watching it Coronas gravity and sure enough again I took a break I was like,0.071173474
why is this in here let me go look this is one of the problems,0.14917558
just watching movie on Netflix cuz you can do this you know you can't do,0.09665617
it in a theater although again as I said it did add to my enjoyment,0.07970486
of the film this is almost reviewed like a pop up movie where you can,0.062191352
go click on stuff while you're watching it because sure enough it turns out the,0.21096575
marooned was one of her own childhood favorite films that actually inspired him to make,0.18036018
the 2013 oscar-winning movie and interestingly marooned won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects back,0.10581709
in 1969 as did gravity so many years later but chrome didn't just include marooned,0.13634038
as an homage but also in the movie in roma we see two separate children,0.092557535
at separate times one middle-class on one very poor and that's reflected in their environments,0.14622065
and their astronaut costumes you know adrift and I think that that's a metaphor for,0.15825737
how it drifted along we all feel so often in life and how it means,0.08489682
so much when someone finally another human who is able to make connection with us,0.18975662
in the vast blackness darkness I think that you know the cold darkness of space,0.44409493
or also you could argue life so I liked that element the film also touches,0.102572486
on how fate decides so much for us just by birth such as race and,0.20436004
economic status and how especially in the late 1960s all over the world but here,0.05967896
in Mexico that those elements define one's life and inescapable ways as for the feminism,0.19066365
bit the ending of this film reminded me an awful lot of the ending of,0.12939742
big little lies even down to the beach and it's interesting to see Hollywood transition,0.33415815
from these stories of female survival to ones of female empowerment equally important and I'd,0.15673117
also like to point out that this fiercely feminist film is written and directed by,0.19204538
a man proving that gender lines or any lines really should not be drawn too,0.19608608
harshly in Hollywood as it continues as over to diversify Hollywood continues to diversify in,0.07888575
front of him behind the camera and the stories that it's telling what I mean,0.10900588
by that as I think it would be dangerous to start saying who can tell,0.12217886
what stories I think what's important is just to get the stories out there as,0.048320435
long as there's diversity in other films and in other ways I don't think that,0.07414816
we want to you know divide ourselves up all right because you have been denied,0.20847805
this film now also I wonder how people react will react to the fact that,0.07164095
it does not seem to start out as a feminist film whatsoever but sure turns,0.40316463
into one all right finally do I think that we Roman deserves all the awards,0.10267331
that it's getting I think it deserves to be nominated for sure and the more,0.07594423
I think about the more I think about Roma and the more I explore it,0.058670495
both actually research researching it and just you know again mulling it over the more,0.13299368
it does impress me but again I personally feel that a film should stand on,0.07675492
its own and korone is way too close to the material roma is an impressive,0.06476689
intriguing film but it's not perfect film and in fact it has many many flaws,0.09323253
obviously so still if you read the articles I've put down below in the video,0.31089434
description I do believe that it is worth your time especially since for most of,0.06699337
you you can watch it for free as part of your Netflix subscription I see,0.07598983
just a lazy afternoon that's when I started it as the perfect time and you,0.33508897
should just force yourself to keep watching trust me it's gonna pick up it's gonna,0.53490317
and again if you read these articles I think you'll enjoy it more and by,0.08128639
the end I think that you will agree that it was time well spent especially,0.07744039
if you're cinephile or if you're interested in any of the elements that I mentioned,0.37213635
here so that's my review of Roma I'm curious to hear your own thoughts down,0.15533799
below have you seen it if not why not what's it gonna take to get,0.058861878
you to watch it and also it please no spoilers and the second half of,0.15344769
the movie in particular there are some very good surprises and that does a lot,0.039038263
to help to help the second act so don't ruin that for anyone they're gonna,0.111070864
need it if they're gonna get through the movie alright so again that's my review,0.08909904
of share those thoughts down below and of course as always you can check out,0.09246456
