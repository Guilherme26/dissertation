what is up YouTube welcome back to my channel sabaidee Dyson I could just start,0.11543023
out by saying this is a ten out of ten instant classic just like I,0.13670708
was saying to my final trailer reaction like I loved the Irishman as far as,0.10699672
it being 3 hours and 29 minutes it does not feel like 3 hours and,0.081787966
29 minutes like you get every bit of what is going on and four 80s,0.31089434
baby like myself who know who Jimmy Hoffa was know the circumstances around Jimmy Hoffa,0.12081828
this movie puts it in perspective from Frank Sheeran's point of view I love it,0.09962966
the de-aging CGI didn't bother me that much because I was just so in tune,0.07999871
with the story you know and I feel like Joe Pesci playing Russell Bufalino Bar,0.06679874
None deserves an Academy Award I love Robert De Niro ask Frank Sheeran I love,0.08193708
Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa I love Harvey Keitel as Don Bruno and I just,0.06270165
feel like everyone gave a great performance but Joe Pesci is bar none the most,0.13139282
entertaining most it kept my my eyes glued to the screen every time Joe Pesci,0.110909894
talks every time he has something to say it was just like the way he,0.10671403
acted with people I love that because you would never think by looking at someone,0.2589065
like that that they're a Mafia don you know like and just the fact that,0.28914458
when I had you know what movies like these I do want to do my,0.071133666
research so when I saw Russell Bufalino as the Bufalino crime family and and here,0.15278596
is depicted as Russell Russell Bufalino like I'm not sure if he was a boss,0.09466022
but it was drawing that tell playing Bruno as the boss and Russell Bufalino was,0.06842711
just kind of like a concierge and turns out that Russell Bufalino was the one,0.24776934
that was he was the silent Donnellan he was the actual box you know I'm,0.076550074
saying I'm just kind of like God giant like dude you a piece like if,0.13827217
you have everyone you know just if you took a liking to you that he,0.08125874
protected you you look out to you one thing in particular that made me feel,0.1524216
like Dan you you you that dude was when Frank Sheeran bombed the laundry um,0.40809196
kinda like the laundry house or their like the industry with for the laundry try,0.109729454
and do that that job for that guy that was like hey you know this,0.16099815
you know it's in competition so Frank made so much money and bombed the laundry,0.22015092
Factory and then he sat down with Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci and Harvick Keitel,0.11437901
was just explaining to him like dude you know like what were you doing that,0.05812433
for who are you doing that for and you just kinda like yeah this ain't,0.11255765
the time for you to be silent like you better tell me cuz you know,0.21246102
in in in so many subtle ways he's basically saying that your life depends upon,0.16561006
it and Frank finally yeah you know the job I was doing affects your money,0.10461939
and he was just like oh yeah you know this is what I I'm sorry,0.12630765
that I did it you know I didn't mean to offend anybody you know just,0.08789283
something I did and you know Harvey Keitel is like man yeah I was a,0.15001364
silent partner and today you shouldn't did it it was unauthorized and just when he,0.101407684
was saying you know do you know how good of a friend you got in,0.057547558
Russell Bufalino and he was like friends like no you don't know and I was,0.20052783
like dang and Joe Pesci just kinda like staring at him like yeah I just,0.15350012
saved your life you know because you know Bruno is he wants your head for,0.19063187
that like you know Mike anybody else will get killed because you Russell's friend and,0.77025414
Russell delight don't do it cuz he didn't he really didn't know he got him,0.076586775
off the hook so I was just like man he was like man basically you,0.31089434
know I would have been sent you to another family you would probably got got,0.10559229
you like you know if it wasn't for him and I'm just like damn like,0.69558394
that's the pull that Russell Bufalino had and for the fact that when you fast,0.09022563
forward when JFK got shot and at that party giving Frank Sheeran their awards and,0.18368936
stuff like that and how Russell Bufalino was telling Frank Sheeran like man if you,0.25394675
can whack a president may you could definitely wack a union boss he ain't no,0.400564
problem and you know here's Jimmy Hoffa Lima tango and dango do that like I'm,0.1277871
I'm a political figure you know Mike I'm in the media like you ain't gonna,0.12664941
do that like without having a heavy scrutiny you know like and Russell's like man,0.1634701
you don't know what we capable of you know and I just love that effect,0.14914171
because even with Joey Joey Gallo I remember watching that you know the document on,0.053750526
Joey Gallo and it was just crazy how that carried out so I'm not sure,0.30466592
if Frank was the one who really carried that hit out on crazy Joe Gallo,0.5226635
but I was really enthralled with watching that documentary about Joey Gallo and how he,0.092178725
was and I don't let that's a crazy dude boy and to say that Frank,0.5918843
got him I'm like man you were deep in the mob and crazy enough Russell,0.49457422
Bufalino I loved how they were showing that people hey this is new Angelo though,0.110200584
this is a Sally and it's showing how at the bottom of the screen it's,0.0954842
like yeah he got shot in the head eight times you know October 26 1980,0.63661814
and I might you've seen all these figure that they're running into talking to people,0.08724878
and how they're getting killed you know after the event you know and Russell died,0.61281186
which is very rare for mob boss to die of natural causes basically he lived,0.31089434
out his whole life not getting assassinated not getting contract killed nothing so you knew,0.4445674
that this dude was cool with every other Don that was in America probably even,0.10162463
in Sicily nobody won in his head he didn't he didn't crossover nobody's toes even,0.23970461
crossover but nobody's fingers and if he had to do a contract kill it was,0.5560138
for a reason like because he that I do to be like man look you,0.16129409
know we could talk things out but if you can't do that he meant business,0.08517464
too that is major respect that was probably before the Philly mob had carmine the,0.0839481
snake I forgot his last name but I really like I said I love mob,0.13286981
movies I love mob documentaries but this was all before carmine the snake came in,0.17915094
to Philly and made Philly a dangerous place to be fusing ma you know and,0.35889024
like I said I run that Jimmy Hoffa time there's there's a lot of speculation,0.08123244
to the theory of Frank sharing with a lot of other theories that who killed,0.44983745
Jimmy Hoffa but with this this put me at ease to know what happened to,0.08361605
Jimmy Hoffa this looks this looks and sounds a little bit more believable because who,0.19770013
else would have got really close to Jimmy Hoffa but at the same time when,0.0547794
I looked at the documents for Jimmy Hoffa they never once mentioned and Frank Sheeran,0.065202676
next to him many photos so I don't know how true or believable I feel,0.11277679
like this is but it feels very believable just by the I heard you pay,0.057993162
houses I love that I love that slogan I love the book I haven't read,0.11746918
it but I love it makes this makes me want to read it to understand,0.122532725
what else they were doing around that time a revolving around Frank Sharon's life and,0.18119092
it just shows how huge is a hardened criminal and it made his daughters kind,0.53490317
of look at him differently and you could tell that he was so into the,0.058732253
life that his his kids were like I can't you know I have no relationship,0.31157938
with you because he's a cold-hearted killer you know and Frank knew that Frank knew,0.53866225
that that's why I'm just like to live out his life the way he did,0.15122718
he knew that the whole time right you know I'm like he just was in,0.08907323
the life that's just what that's what it does to you you know it's just,0.077637635
like being in the war and as he mentioned frequently endless like it's just like,0.13851462
being that war it's like you know this is what it is so I loved,0.2528589
every minute of it this is like I said an instant classic I'm definitely gonna,0.12515959
check this out again whenever it's like a year or two three years down the,0.07974101
road this is going to be instant classic and if in his shock just like,0.101510875
Goodfellas and away you know and that's why I was like him somebody's getting the,0.1114789
wars for this Netflix got him one finally cuz then he plus was like yeah,0.15781458
we you know we only tell Netflix got them one with this definitely like I,0.037917398
said ten out of ten I love the performances I love the dialogue it's a,0.09022166
slow burn dialogue and I missed that and movies where it's not a lot of,0.08648259
action you don't need it you just need to pay attention to the dialogue into,0.09318289
the story like you have to pay attention to understand the next scene I've missed,0.08060476
that in movies and this movie carried it out to perfection awesome tacular if you're,0.08690612
Jeremy Jones fan Chris tuck me a plus five out of five wolves if you,0.40813437
