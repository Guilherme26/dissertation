bad meets eighth-grade and like a little bit of Ferris Bueller what is up like fans and welcome back to my channel,0.26297736
I just saw a screening of the brand new movie book-smart and today we are going to talk about it,0.09645795
I need you guys in the comments down below have you seen this movie or are you gonna see it,0.1532763
when it drops here,0.06704204
in a few days worldwide to audiences all around the world,0.087788254
and let's talk about book-smart,0.2877159
so to academic teenage superstars realize on the eve of their high school graduation that they should have worked less,0.09852565
and played more determined to never fall short of their peers,0.0846906
the girls set out on a mission to cram four years of fun into one night now to be honest with you guys before going into this film,0.2723316
I had heard nothing but good things about it from advanced screenings and festivals that it has played in Olivia Wilde who has never to my knowledge directed a film before I was nervous for this first time director I was nervous that this film was going to fall into many cliches and tropes of films in this vein,0.096657045
I wanted it to feel like super bad but I didn't want it to feel like a straight ripoff of super bad now it does feel like super bad in a way,0.2251629
but for a new generation for a brand new audience,0.047639832
and it does things that we do not expect while doing things that we did expect but doing them in the best way possible guys,0.118014865
book-smart just start out,0.15298846
this review was really really funny and at the end of the day that's what it's all about does this comedy centric movie make you laugh,0.16771397
while giving you the heartwarming fuzzies that you want with a film like this,0.09779392
it is a coming-of-age story,0.07371039
so of course I want to relate to these characters so how did I feel about the two leads,0.05769344
oh my god,0.059858847
these two girls are amazing,0.15066686
and we know they're amazing because we've seen them in other things before they have been good individually as co-stars on other films kaitlyn dever the spectacular,0.07406218
now short term 12 beautiful boys she has been in many of films this for me is her best performance and then her best friend beanie,0.24043825
Betty is a beanie Feldstein,0.15332478
I know her from Lady Bird,0.11311436
and she was a standout in that film she played the best friend character and she was fantastic in this film she gets more of a lead role even though she's play the best friend character a very similar character but different in its own way,0.049272258
and the riding for this movie is spectacular,0.09634236
the dialogue the script it is,0.03382405
so tight I never felt as if anything on the screen was boring me because even though this is a slightly conventional concept like I said it kind of runs off of movies and stories that we have seen before,0.088155694
but it's a coming-of-age story what more can you do other than these two guys,0.15762822
these two girls these two best friends go out for one night it's one night of trouble there gonna be something that they've never been before,0.24765317
they're going to break away from what they're known as and known for and it usually falls on either the final day of high school or the first day of high school and this falls on their graduation or pre graduation night,0.10785061
so yes it's leaning on those tropes to get the audience in but once you're in it does not lean on those tropes from a narrative perspective it does things it subverts expectations to a degree that you're gonna walk out having had a really great time,0.10530382
but then you're gonna think about it,0.064359255
and think about how much you enjoy these characters together think about the chemistry think about the relationships and think about how it makes you feel,0.06469324
and how it throws you back to your days as a high schooler it really threw me back,0.24406637
I'm only 23,0.07329042
so I just graduate it's it's been a while now,0.06335063
but while I was watching it really put me back in that situation it made me rethink some things,0.09487319
in my past was I really doing the thing that I should have been doing in high school,0.061408754
did I break away and be the person that I should have been this film this silly little movie called book-smart that has really dirty hardcore laughs in there and some people will see it as,0.60015666
well those are just nonsensical jokes directed towards teenagers,0.2813285
and it's basically potty humor,0.17280377
but I found the humor charming and it felt like it fit none of it felt forced there were one or two jokes that did not make me laugh,0.062040783
and a few moments that fell flat from a humorous standpoint but I was so locked into the characters I did not care,0.1027298
I was all in a majority of the jokes and these two friends their chemistry just carries the entire movie I'm not gonna say on their shoulders because once again the direction the writing every thing was really good but you're in it for their relationship,0.07551881
and you care when they have their quarrels and conversations and discussions and thoughts on the meaning of life everything you're invested because they have built you up to the point,0.07846744
and delivered on every note so far and by the end of the film like,0.053702693
I said I walked out having had a great time,0.11380426
but I was thinking you know there were some moments where I wasn't laughing as much,0.088246346
as I should have been laughing,0.050616127
but I just thought about the relationship between the characters and how it felt so much like high school and it wasn't casting 27 and 28 year olds as high schoolers even though some of these guys were clearly a bit older you still had actors who looked like they were in high school a really talented supporting cast by the way I recognize multiple people from multiple other movies the teachers included of course,0.102466546
you have like Jason Sudeikis and Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte and Billie lourd who plays a crazy character in this movie of course Billie lourd is Carrie Fisher's daughter,0.45414135
we've seen her pop up in Star Wars and it's super minor role and she's been on television shows but she is spontaneous and crazy,0.46558872
and this ongoing gag in this movie that is hilarious,0.18076204
and that's the thing,0.060957022
I'll say about this film even if you're not having the best most incredible time in the theater while you're watching it,0.107283145
there are gags that start out at the beginning of this movie and carry through do not get annoying and pay off,0.1471728
at the end,0.065276995
I spotted three or four things in there that they set something up and then they pay that off at the end of the film all of the character arcs all the story lines they all come to fruition and they end off as you expect a bit of a predictable nature,0.08243376
but as you expect in the best way and it encapsulates what it means to grow up,0.10235509
it really is a great coming-of-age story in that regard,0.07240206
it reminded me of 8th grade last year with like I said those super bad elements,0.17850484
the over-the-top humor,0.06711831
the zany characters the wacky things that they get themselves into all of those things,0.20170166
were awesome,0.041745216
and yeah guys,0.10491389
I can just keep talking about this movie,0.07756141
I'm definitely doing that on my letterbox page when I log that for review later on tonight,0.12587142
but right,0.045029547
now I have to give this thing a score like,0.052469693
I said it's not a perfect film I did have a few nitpicks and issues here and there and maybe one or two things felt shoehorned not the political nature of the movie that was one thing that I was a bit afraid of going in like I don't want to be hit in the face with certain elements and themes,0.22224182
but now they didn't do that they were just there to make you laugh,0.08034757
and Olivia Wilde made sure of that by the way her directing in this film cinematography everything to look the feel the relationships great stop talking off the back to the score,0.1959551
I'm gonna go 90 percent for book smart really funny movie,0.14262918
