[Music] a war fans welcome back to room 237 coming at you with another review of 1920s silent horror film this time I'm going back all the way to 1920 with the cabinet of dr. Caligari which I'm holding this up because I don't own it like many films back then as part of the public domain so you can find it on YouTube which is how I watched it but I would love hold it like an idiot but I would love to own this because I really enjoyed this movie as far as silent films go I will put it up there with Nosferatu it might actually be tied with a very different film it's very easy to see the influence in it um I mean especially with people like Tim Burton or any sort of visual filmmaker and the thing about dr. Caligari is it is widely considered to be the first true horror film way back in 1920 course is debatable there's been horror films before then mostly short films or trick films this was the first one that I think was full-length and not a trick for my guess but yeah so while it considered to be the first ever horror film so I have this is a movie I want to see for a long time I've heard it mentioned I've seen it referenced a bunch of times in movies for the longest time I thought it was part of that 50 movie collection that I have I don't and it's been kind of hard for me to find except for online but you know I mean what can be said about it that hasn't already been said it is a I mean saying its original would be kind of crazy because of how old it is of course is [ __ ] original I would I will say that this movie is a bigger our prime example of the German expressionist movement then say Nosferatu just because of the visual style and Nosferatu feels mo even though it is German expressionist it feels more straightforward then this does this is like witnessing someone's dream that's how crazy and trippy this movie is I mean the whole movie literally looks like this it looks like it is done on a stage like weird angles like the way streets are depicted jagged lines windows are like triangles shadows from like lampposts or furniture or trees is actually painted onto the set so you get this very artistic look to the film which I find very fascinating and very in other senses you could say it's cheesy and cheap but with this it really feels more artistic and more more intriguing to look at see if I could just pull something up I should have done this before but I didn't anyway and this the story is rather simple it it is all it opens up with this young man named Francis played by because I'm only familiar with one actor in this movie so I don't know anyone else a frederick fair i believe is how you pronounce his name he plays this guy at francis he's sitting on a bench with this older man and this woman played by little dag / lil dag / that's right plays Jane and he says oh that's my fiancee we've seen some crazy [ __ ] and he tells him the story so he's probably the earliest unreliable narrator in horror and he tells a story about how you know at some point in this past the carnival came to town and this strange man came in and he had like an act with this um saamne bolused I believe is how you pronounce it which is a sleepwalker played by conrad veidt also from the man who laughs plays the sleepwalker named Caesar and dr. Caligari is played by Werner crap werner krauss excuse me and basically the story is anyone that sort of gives this doctor [ __ ] he pretty much hypnotizes or uses caesar to commit to go out and kill them and the way it's done is it's beautifully done I would say the score - this is better than nos bra to wear nos bra to is more of like a gothic church organ even though I like that this score seemed to fit a bit more and you know I had different tempos and went with the film more and basically one of France's his friends named Alan is murdered by Caesar so the more Francis looks into the murder you know the more we find out about this dr. caligari in Caesar until eventually you know and I mean it is a rather short film it's you know it's just over an hour like an hour maybe 10 15 minutes the doctor sent Cesar after Jane in her sleep what'd you get probably my favorite scene of the film which she's in her bedroom and he he creeps up he wears like black leggings like a black turtleneck and he has this weird like black diamond eye makeup everyone has weird ass makeup in this movie especially dr. Caligari and just the way conrad veidt as caesar like approaches her as she's sleeping with the knife and doesn't work he captures her but yeah I did mean to pull up just some stills of the sets just so you can I mean this is this is like a walkway as he's carrying Jane I mean jagged walkways and god damnit let me close or even like streets which is clearly like a wooden or cardboard set with all these weird strange lines one last one the the scene of him and Jane's bedroom possibly the best personally my favorite scene in the film and also on YouTube I saw it in the original print so you get some black and white you get like the gold sepia tone you get like the blue that you see a lot but one I've never seen before because even now a two is like sepia or blue when he's in Jane's house other than her bedroom it's like this weird purple and it seems like Jane's house and even Francis's house is that's like when everything looks normal like the furniture is an all Tim Burton jagged looking and that's why some film historians don't say it's a prime example of German expressionist because there's a little bit of scenes that aren't like I feel weird saying spoiler alert because this movie is 99 [ __ ] years old but there was a twist ending that I did not see coming which is this dr. Caligari is he's a director of this insane asylum and he was reading about you know couple hundred years ago there was this doctor Caligari that used a saamne bolused to carry out acts of murder named Caesar so he became obsessed and eventually a patient who was a song SS came in and he sort of practiced on him named him Caesar and sort of became the new doctor Caligari and so it's like it's told in flashback from Francis's point of view but then we get to flashback to calc Ahri's past and then like when the authorities capture Caligari and put him away and we cut back to regular time you find out the guy that Frances is talking to is another mental patient Jane is a mental patient Caesars a mental patient and Frances is a mental patient and Caligari who now does not have makeup is still a director of an asylum so it's like nothing I'm sure there's different things you can take away from it but you know I just the depths of madness that this movie is is insane I know another form of German Expressionists or another big aspect of it is harsh Authority like sort of interpreting harsh Authority you know like Caligari and being like a madman Caesar sort of be in the German soldier sleepwalking and there was this one guy who wrote a book called um Caligari to hit saying how this film is like a premonition of Hitler some 13 years later at least but I definitely look at it as I mean and even if this is the first horror movie ever which I consider it to be it is still a damn behind film silent movies even though I love old silent horror movies like family opera which I'll review at some point or not fraught - which I have reviewed it it can be harder to watch because you know people are overacting because silent films are you know in art form of body language but this movie it the visual style the story the music even the title cards I mean the title cards aren't just you know a black screen with text I mean it's just weird fawn and some of them like when Caligari is Sanyo at the carnival step right up ask Caesar your fortune at the bottom of the title card there'll be like a shape like a cane sort of like how he's getting everyone's attention or later on we're talking about murder at the bottom of the tunnel of cars it's like a drawing of like a sharp object they really utilized the title cards which even that I thought was very interesting you know like for example the title cards are you know with we are backgrounds and shapes and fog and again how every set doesn't there's no exterior shots it looks like a play like it's all cardboard or particle board or something the fact that they paint shadows with black paint like this movie really is like a nightmare or like a dream it is the most surreal move well I mean you could also say Eraserhead is the most surreal horror film but two totally different [ __ ] films it still it still is very surreal and very dreamlike and of all the older horror movies that I've been watching lately this might be one of my favorites and I would love to own it I would love to you know especially find an Edition that has some features because I would love to look into the making of this it was directed by Robert Wayne wine German name but still just a simple story about a guy telling his story about [ __ ] he's seen involving him and his fiancee about this crazy doctor with a sleepwalker that kills people under his behest with twist after twist and just the most surreal again sounds we were saying original about original set designs and music and just the way people wear their makeup eaten that was another thing I noticed during the main events of the film everyone has this weird makeup so you know when you see Caligari up close he looks really creepy conrad veidt looks really creepy but then in present time when we see where Francis is everyone looks normal but very haunting images I love the set designs you know and again it's easy to see the influence it's it's no surprise to me that next year this film is gonna be a hundred years old and there's still people who are into it amazed by it and talk about it I I wish I found this film earlier I loved the cabinet of dr. Caligari it is the prime example of horror in the 20s and I was amazed by you know the first ever horror film and I thought it was that good even though I liked old horror movies anyway even that old but I thought it was great I highly recommend it especially even if you're not into silent films or necessarily old horror films in general if you are definitely check it out but even if you're just into visually striking films that look like nothing you've ever seen before definitely check it out so worth that I loved it this movie I was blown away by it but that is 1920s the cabinet of dr. Caligari thank you for watching
