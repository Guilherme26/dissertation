[Music] hey what's up guys donal here from cinema critics and today i'm gonna be reviewing thor ragnarok thor ragnarok is about Thor he's in prison and a gladiator type place and he has to save a scarred from being the short by hella so I mean right off the bat I thought the first story was okay I wasn't feeling I wasn't I wasn't really liking the second one and Thor is my favorite Marvel you know hero he's my favorite and then my favorite villain is you know it always been always been not since the movie he's always been my favorite so so yeah so you know it needed to do something fresh you know from from the first and second Thor movies and it definitely did this movie is pretty much a comedy movie with action to it and and it feels good I don't think they should do all the Marvel movies like this from now on but this for it's definitely for Thor because Thor is it's it's hard to make a good Thor movie because it's just the whole you know he's a guy and you don't with a scarred and all that stuff and this really gave it a really great injection of comedy and it's done well you know about 85% of the you know of the laughs or you know the jokes was done really well and like busts out you know laughing comedy and it was done really it wasn't slapstick so for the most part it was some slapstick but most of it was just funny you know funny jokes and I would say this is probably the funniest Marvel movie that that's out right now and the action is done is done really well it's not too much action there's a lot of you know CG parts to it but overall a good action to it and you know it's Thor so you know he's flying around and stuff like that and you know he's strong he's a guide so it's gonna be slotted CG but it's done wow there's a few slow motion scenes in this movie and every slow motion shot in this movie was like done perfectly they did a way that bring it like for flashbacks they showed you wishes in the trailer this slow motion you know really really super slow motion effect for showing like flashbacks and stuff like that it's I loved it it looked very beautiful for eats like slow motion flashback and also just slow motion shots and within the action looked really good as well you know this movie it's a pretty long movie I think it's but like 2 hours and 10 minutes maybe around there and it didn't feel long the pacing was done really well you know it started off really action II and the you know in the beginning and then it was good enough between action and you know talking there's a good percentage you know a good time between each I really enjoyed Tessa Thompson's character as valkyrie is really cool I even like Jeff Goldblum's character Grand Master he was very funny in this movie and it was it was awesome so yeah overall it's really good it felt like for some reason it felt like a 70s sci-fi movie like I got that vibe from it had a lot of neon colors and it it looked really well like almost like how Black Panther is like they just infused it with even more colors you know it's even more colorful than it always was and it's now they're doing a lot of neon and stuff like that it really looked really nice pretty much I like almost everything about it I still think they need work with the villains Kate Blanchet as playing as hella she looked awesome she played the part very well I liked the character I just don't like the the intentions I don't like there's not much you know backstory to build the character up you know they almost had over her but it's just I need more from the villain not just you know I want to destroy you know more motivation you know more just more motivation than what was given a little bit more backstory to her would have been a little bit better more Oshin more range or something something just give me something more than you know I'm gonna destroy the world type till I still think you know butcher was done well you know vulture and Loki are pretty much like the best villains and the Marvel Cinematic Universe and you know they you know she was I liked her she looked awesome you know how she you know like her hair and all a sudden the spikes came out on her on her headpiece looked really cool but you know just look I just want a little bit more with her I think Tyco YTD did an awesome job directing this movie and I think he invigorated Thor movie movies and it completely turned around the whole series and you know hopefully there's another one hopefully it's done in this style so overall guys thor ragnarok is an awesome movie it brings a lot of comedy to Thor and I think it's done well and I think that's what door needed to break out the pack from the other series and you know stand out he definitely definitely stands out from the other and I just don't hope I hope that you know this is not the form of the go it's just just for the Thor you know movies and not everything else but definitely great definitely get a chance to go see it so I'm gonna get a thor ragnarok and a awesome awesome movie I would've gave in a plus if it wasn't for I just want a little bit more with Ella and able to get a perfect score but overall thor ragnarok is really good and I think it's probably top three and Marvel movies so thanks for watching guys have you seen Thor Ragnarok yet what you thought please leave in the comments below let me know what
