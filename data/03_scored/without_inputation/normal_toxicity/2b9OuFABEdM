hi I'm an angel and today I will be reviewing the 2018 thriller a quiet,0.104594864
place this is John Krasinski's directorial debut you may know him as Jim Halpert from,0.09888249
the office that's how I know him and I was really surprised directorial debut and,0.055181254
we're going for a horror thriller really I was kind of hoping that his directorial,0.2819433
debut would be threat level midnight - but you know so a quiet place what,0.17355901
did I think I want to see in the movies I don't usually see who,0.15000953
are movies in the cinema because scary you know and if you're like me and,0.114133894
you're pretty chicken and vulnerable I'm gonna say you may not like the movie going,0.6577954
experience so so much but it's a good movie not just horror movie good movie,0.10958892
it's a fun movie to go see in the cinema but be careful if you,0.10255003
have a cough try not to call if you have popcorn or crunchy food or,0.11759187
anything that crinkles and cracks you will be singled out I went with a bag,0.31089434
of popcorn I always sneak in my own food and I just realized in the,0.10399181
cinema how noisy it was so I ate like all of it during the previews,0.20109709
just to make sure that I wouldn't make any noise during the movie it's not,0.055874974
a completely silent movie but it is pretty quiet so you do want to respect,0.13675687
the movie-going experience maintain the ambiance of silence when it is demanded plus if you,0.18692626
get sucked into the movie which happens pretty easily because the story is well schooled,0.5154597
and well portrayed you're gonna hold your breath often and I had my coat over,0.39220646
my face there are jump scares there are quite a few I thought some of,0.15295525
them were kind of useless I'm just gonna say raccoon I think you know what,0.6046199
I mean if you saw the movie that was kind of annoying they kind of,0.25943953
emphasized the jumps with sound and music and loud bangs and strings of hits whatever,0.17973691
not necessary I often talk about how these jump scares and horror movies are cheap,0.31089434
movie tricks to get people to get scared but your story should be scary enough,0.17215635
or you can't have a jump scare but it doesn't have to be so emphasized,0.18188688
with useless sounds that wouldn't be there in the real circumstance you know what I,0.43225482
mean for example I hate it in horror movies especially monster horror movies when there's,0.46826783
a mom and it's making all this sound and somebody's hiding from it and all,0.12929739
of a sudden it's really really quiet right and then the person either turns around,0.099246725
opens the door or does something and the monsters right there and they go back,0.27670252
and there's like a huge sound but it's like weren't you just noisy this whole,0.21793523
time you were coming down the stairs like yeah like in the walking dead too,0.5081707
you know it'll be like the monsters go when they walk they are not inconspicuous,0.46435
and yet there be a moment where everybody's just in the woods in the silence,0.1506114
of nature all pretty and all of a sudden they get in a psych I,0.31089434
really dislike it when movies do that and luckily this movie doesn't do that the,0.07765468
monster here I think it's an alien is safe to say it's pretty freakin noisy,0.5876557
all the time and they don't really have those moments of not noisiness which is,0.05854242
weird because apparently they're really sensitive to noise and they don't like noises yeah they,0.10159168
are so noisy like what is wrong with you you're like a broken car or,0.5154597
something if you see the trailer you know what the story's about it sets it,0.039800137
up pretty directly you know it's post-apocalyptic monster ville few families survive must be quiet,0.31511405
the monsters are sensitive to noise so they will hear you so you got to,0.31214172
live in an ultra quiet world which is not how this earth this world is,0.15197912
built babies come out the womb crying you know so we're kind of made to,0.47290173
make noise speaking of babies they integrated that into the movie of course mama has,0.3413406
a pregnancy and has to give birth in this world now you could say birth,0.24176753
alone pregnancy that's enough to make a horror movie right it's pretty gruesome and painful,0.37427503
and awful and there's a lot of screaming involved so you don't need much more,0.29291585
but add on top of that creepy monsters creeping on you looking to kill you,0.8634416
maybe feast on your baby like a Big Mac horror thriller suspense and they did,0.55164665
it well these kind of movies you don't usually get an exploration of the situation,0.07131121
or in they'll just throw you into a post-apocalyptic world with certain characteristic people have,0.49280736
to accommodate to a new style of life but you don't get to explore that,0.09076903
concept you don't get to see what it would look like in a day to,0.101887815
day of somebody living in this type of world but here we do and I,0.32005203
really appreciated that we get to see them live in a world without shoes first,0.17626652
of all I'm out come on really no shoes like not even espadrilles or ballet,0.13169108
slippers can be really stealthy a great idea is to pour sand all over the,0.15063056
place two five full sounds crunching of leaves when you walk on floor branches cracking,0.09911941
whatever luckily for them this alien cannot see but in here's so they have lightbulbs,0.17402913
and flashlights and triggering things clever and in this kind of world the families that,0.31089434
survive are obviously the families that learn sign language before all of this hits so,0.094464414
huge advantage to having that skill in the back pocket you got to know how,0.13221459
to soundproof a room you got to know how are you gonna do when a,0.09100339
baby comes because the babies cry and they thought of this and all that and,0.2811899
it's what it was really interesting I just appreciated that side of things the fleshing,0.08709036
out of a concept and not just okay situation a horror movie run from monster,0.27380684
you know which we get all the time John Krasinski plays opposite his real-life wife,0.26333097
II emily Blunt's and oh my gosh their chemistry is so real so lived-in there's,0.104898445
an intimate scene between the two that felt so natural and thick like thicker than,0.1091242
Pam and Jim you know and I never thought that I would ever say that,0.0838773
because I live for pen and Jim but after seeing this I was like okay,0.07674924
I forgive you Jim for not marrying Pam in real life I get it you,0.32588264
two so cute it's uh speaking of the cast everybody did a fantastic job the,0.1406482
eldest daughter has a lot of complexity in her acting her facial expressions are layered,0.21744578
I really appreciated it kids can easily come off as OneNote actors in movies but,0.15974164
in this case all kids really played their part so yeah like I said this,0.16916327
is a good movie a good thriller a good suspense good building and so much,0.14317176
so that when there are scenes with music I was tense I was like should,0.064802445
you be listening to an iPod right now like I don't know what if you,0.29697514
miss something your ears are busy and you don't hear the sound of a crate,0.25255868
falling in the backyard and now you gotta prepare because monsters are coming so they,0.41212285
did a good job at making this world believable and immersive like there's the scene,0.15236787
with a river I got so tense I was like I don't know about this,0.10610399
I was like the kid character in that scene I don't know that there's that,0.100647986
much more to say without spoiling it so I'm going to transition into the spoiler,0.16180721
segment I'm just gonna wrap it up by saying if you like horror movies or,0.36950943
thrillers more with suspense no blood there's like almost no blood in this movie so,0.1772414
really that's also a huge plus if you like movies that really have a good,0.11112402
story and science fictiony and that are well thought out science fiction stories if you,0.034574524
like monster movies or I would even say if you don't like monster movies I,0.45741153
don't like monster movies I've mentioned this in another review I prefer a movie that,0.27660093
leaves more to the imagination when it comes to scariness but this monster is actually,0.48516986
scary-looking interesting to look at well-conceived I would say obviously people have said that it,0.10442847
looks like a demo Gorgon from stranger things which it really does but to me,0.10439026
it also looks like an artichoke and I tried to eat one of those and,0.19454817
it almost killed me so it's not so far-fetched to have an artichoke as a,0.40338707
monster they sharp I just recommend this movie go see with a bunch of friends,0.38498712
in the cinema so they can appease you when things get jumpy or watch it,0.10895152
at home either way I encourage people to go out and watch this movie it's,0.08148296
a good movie and talk about an ending well you want to get up and,0.107217535
praise I wanted more though it ends a bit prematurely to me it's like oh,0.12519564
my gosh I want to keep going with this maybe it could have continued into,0.108243704
the credits but they ended it in a classy way you know you don't want,0.08476132
to give people too much or too little but it would have been fun kind,0.10279538
of like Dawn of the Dead I think it is where the story kind of,0.23974532
continues and the credits and you get a little bit of an alternate ending if,0.19371088
you will oh yes finally I remember and this movie gave me a huge I,0.09164326
am Legend vibes so if you also liked that kind of movie you'll enjoy this,0.12847963
okay it's time to transition into these spoilers so I'm just gonna say before you,0.23897587
go like this video subscribe to music game news and thanks for watching whoo spoil,0.19191869
alright let's talk about this movie a place mmm the crazy dude in the woods,0.5154597
okay unpack this with me because I didn't really understand and we had like a,0.08624913
discussion with a group of people I went to see but still I didn't think,0.08753367
it was very clear here's my interpretation of it Jim and baby Ryan filleth I,0.14981881
mean he really looks like Ryan Phillips Oh walking through the woods and they come,0.11438998
across a dude and a dead woman and this dude kind of looks cray he,0.5592486
looks like he's about to snap looks like it's about to scream and he does,0.25619063
and then blah blah blah you know what happens monster comes to claim that booty,0.54259163
I thought it was a murder-suicide I think this person went crazy living in this,0.6481042
world it'll play on a person psychology it's almost inevitable so he made sense for,0.10783134
me to see this person as someone who snaps and he took his wife's life,0.566989
or daughter I think wife and then he was ready to take his own life,0.39018017
because he couldn't live under the constant pressure or fear of not making it through,0.107132986
tomorrow someone else said that maybe the monster killed his wife and he came across,0.678204
her and then he just screamed out of the shock of it all the fear,0.22689413
you know hitting him I don't know she just wasn't disfigured enough and we didn't,0.47448775
linger enough on the body for us to really analyze the situation but she wasn't,0.13873142
worn up enough to be like oh yeah this was done by an alien and,0.24471267
not just a dude with a knife but if you got a good look at,0.29469195
her body I just tried not to look cuz I don't want to see her,0.31089434
corpse did you notice maybe the way she was killed would give an indication as,0.5412117
to how she met her end okay let's talk about the birth scene because that,0.08256587
was intense for so many reasons first off someone had a group of people I,0.16899753
went to see the movie with said that the star of this movie is that,0.08127572
nail on the stairs all you can think about is that nail as Merson at,0.06714371
the end when the daughter's about to come down the stairs and she wasn't looking,0.18942004
at mama when mama said watch out for the nail so you thought oh she's,0.27314362
gonna trip on it too and scream yes so that nails very clever touch but,0.22591989
really does she have to like pull on that bag that was kind of a,0.15251964
stretch you would think in a world where you have to be uber careful if,0.10578113
you are carrying a load of laundry and it snags on something you're gonna stop,0.4303031
you're gonna go down carefully you're going to carefully unhook it and be on your,0.3556401
way not pull on it and maybe dislodge something I don't know I would think,0.14646931
splinter not nail but even a splinter it's pretty darn painful it was a stretch,0.5162911
but fine movie magic right so momma punctures her foot oh she had to swallow,0.64999175
that because the demagogue ins was right there then she makes her way to the,0.09547181
tub and the thing is coming up the stairs like it is right there we,0.1155299
see it right there meanwhile kid is going to explode them fireworks right when Jim,0.46573254
said go get the Rockets though I thought they were referring to the spaceship because,0.058728855
that thing makes a lot of noise right and I was like oh shoot the,0.29818258
Sun is gonna go to find the rocket that the daughter brought to the burial,0.14603308
site but he's not gonna find it and that's gonna be a whole plot twist,0.11220692
but it made more sense to go in the direction that they went in to,0.044110555
have fireworks that the kid can light and run away from so that it gives,0.09895469
him time to be away from the loudness so yeah we're with Mama in the,0.15205908
tub and she screams and then we see the fireworks explode and I was a,0.20583673
bit confused because they made it look like the explosion happened right after she screamed,0.18814078
now if I'm the monster and I'm hunting I'm looking for food some people said,0.20956405
that they don't eat their kill they just kill it was written somewhere I didn't,0.7093121
see that written anywhere so I'm thinking they're snacking I hear a scream I am,0.14938162
one foot maybe from that scream from that snack then I hear a bigger North,0.11691096
in the distance now I know that I got two snacks it's an it logical,0.058764488
for the monster to first address the first noise it has come across since it's,0.31089434
like right there even if it's not the snack on the minutes just to stop,0.111481845
noises wouldn't it make more sense for them the monster to be like you know,0.46696812
what let me deal with this mess first before I put out that fire so,0.240658
what they could have done instead was that she could have screamed and they could,0.14527647
have played the fireworks audio at the exact same time and then cut to it,0.078637905
so that we understand that her screaming was maybe muffled by the sound of the,0.14517117
firework but the firework wasn't so close to the house though that it would drown,0.2755576
out the sounds of a mother in you know what I mean you go with,0.19117595
it and that's another thing we see them in the pharmacy early on mama you,0.14943156
guys thought of everything but you didn't think of grabbing them birth control pills you,0.26668435
live near the pharmacy when we see them on day 89 it is you know,0.1334665
they already kind of figured out how to live in this world or they're still,0.09527038
figuring it out and now we're at day 472 or something so you've had time,0.15304306
to consider that you're in this world and maybe having a baby isn't a good,0.38596088
idea but maybe that was their executive decision we're gonna have a kid we're gonna,0.08113105
take the biggest risk of all time what we're gonna create a soundproof studio in,0.071878396
the basement I don't know that a rickety old wooden house is the best place,0.17233783
to hide but maybe that's all they had on hand I don't know it's probably,0.08081303
their home you know so it makes sense fine oh my god that scene when,0.10041418
she is sleeping and she wakes up to the sound of waters first of all,0.14926356
you're like ah spa day but no she's knee-deep in water and her baby's crib,0.46824026
is afloat and the monsters in the corner now when I saw that I was,0.23179908
like oh oh my god I was convinced that that monster just had a happy,0.40337378
meal and that baby was snacked upon Oh luckily oh that was not the case,0.15074769
and she had to summon all of her courage to save that baby and the,0.16497463
way she sank it to that impromptu waterfall reminded me of the way Homer Simpson,0.21289563
sunk into those bushes can we talk about the baby dying at beginning oh he,0.34936246
was so cute adorable little kid that really shook everybody in the audience I mean,0.17799136
if you watch the trailer you see it coming though right I didn't think that,0.052440688
Jim could outrun that monster because that's what they do in movies right the human,0.5079939
usually outrun something that you clearly see it cannot outrun but here they kept it,0.07528563
realistic no there was no way it was gonna outrun that monster that baby was,0.53490317
snatched and it was a good way to set the tone I think very early,0.05274786
on set the tone for the movie so now you know what the stakes are,0.059030537
you know it was very clever right and then later on oh my goodness I,0.14493161
actually shed a tear when Jim dies and then you're left thinking what if his,0.28236464
wife didn't give him that speech about you got to protect him because what the,0.14937714
hell are we doing here if we can't at least protect our kids if she,0.44296828
didn't tell him that maybe he would have been in that moment life okay let's,0.093644075
see what we have a new one we did lose that one I could go,0.0943255
and make sure that the new one is taken care of do I really want,0.055102337
to do this right now like I mean these kids are kind of annoying sue,0.4938246
maybe I should just let them all get in and continue in this world's freest,0.17844668
bird it would be a lot easier yes I know could I live with it,0.07635392
and I kind of thought it would have been hilarious if he had let that,0.10220069
monster eat his kids and he had to snuck away come back knowing that mama,0.7042859
is watching them on the screen the whole time oh honey I'm so sorry I,0.08535368
I couldn't find the kids so look in the morning okay we just go to,0.066335045
bed okay knowing that that nail is there and not telling him but then that,0.17917663
would have just been like a Tyler Perry movie this movie even had kind of,0.17676362
a Marvel feel right with that earpiece that goes berserk every time the monsters get,0.32126692
close which that I didn't really understand does this monster itself emit some kind of,0.33385253
a radio frequency or wave that interfered with the ear piece every time I would,0.13432203
get close to it because it didn't just mess up randomly it only messed up,0.112113014
when the monsters were closed so clearly and had something to do with what they,0.24127352
do when they open up their face their ear their artichoke lamp oh and when,0.16909474
she turned it off in that truck oh the audience audible gasps it was just,0.08871311
like no girl you are the superhero you are that's why I was so excited,0.40314034
when we get to the end and Mama is figuring it out and you just,0.1369693
want to scream it at her like piece it together girl this is your scooby-doo,0.4696868
moment figure it out finally she gets it and we get this badass ending pardon,0.31089434
my language but badass gotta say it with momma and daughter click click okay baby,0.53490317
let's get in formation and they slay and that's why I was so disappointed that,0.40952012
they ended it there I wanted to see the slight edge and they could have,0.049604263
put some Beyonce on and just pull pull pull pop yeah yeah did I thought,0.19414936
that it could have been okay to be fair that's Missy Elliott but that would,0.052107703
have worked so you know what I'm saying I'm better I'm better I'm better get,0.06415556
him get him get him and play that in the credits while they are just,0.08486943
cleaning house just saying so there probably won't be a sequel because it was a,0.10308366
really nicely tightly made movie ended with a bow it was about the quiet place,0.0837527
I don't know how they could continue unless they do a sequel with a new,0.21579194
family somewhere else in the u.s. also dealing with this in another original way maybe,0.10395735
we live in this very sequel eyes era where every movie needs a sequel and,0.14961614
sometimes it's nice to just have a story have the end at the end of,0.06099189
it and be beautiful and great as it is no sequel no screw-ups after just,0.19367164
a beautiful crepe dash of cinnamon perfect I really didn't expect to appreciate this movie,0.1421717
as much as I did but I really did and I would love to know,0.07242348
what did you think of a quiet place let us all know in the comment,0.060732797
