black clans mint directed by Spike Lee is a biographical drama film that takes place,0.009896653
in 1970s Colorado Springs where a man by the name of Ron Stallworth is desperate,0.07360122
to prove himself within the Colorado Springs Police Department Ron eventually becomes a detective where,0.063344665
he works undercover with Adam drivers character flip to infiltrate the local chapter of the,0.08974521
white supremacist group known as a Ku Klux Klan Ron calls the white supremacist and,0.6253719
pretends to be a white supremacist himself and named Ron Stallworth and Flip actually attends,0.44625017
events under that name as the two tried to infiltrate the KKK and tear them,0.29899585
down things get very dangerous for both of them r17 to see black Klansmen for,0.5558498
a while now it's been getting a lot of rave reviews and a lot of,0.046076033
buzz and I'm actually a big fan personally of Adam drivers so he's probably mostly,0.10304222
what drew me to go see this one in theaters I've never actually seen another,0.07618858
Spike Lee movie but I do know a lot of people really loved his work,0.11038192
so that probably played into a little bit for me as well I like black,0.26559487
Klansmen a lot of ultimately I don't think it's quite Best Picture good but it's,0.06947484
certainly one of the best films that come out this year thus far I don't,0.08993281
think this one will make my top ten list at the end of the year,0.06898719
because Oscar season hasn't really kicked in yet we haven't hit a lot of the,0.11007603
great films yet but I think this is a very good film with a lot,0.10677475
going for it I think black clansmen is a very good very well rounded film,0.3484778
that certainly succeeds in a handful of different areas at a high level firstly I,0.060884915
think the story is very well put together it's pace well the characters are interesting,0.027634174
and the story feels genuine to its source material the memoirs of the real Ron,0.062992744
stallworth himself this story feels like an honest telling of events that led to some,0.085256115
even more odd and unlikely defeats of evil the film dedicates a lot of time,0.18444942
showing you how dangerous and just purely awful these white supremacists are how they're motivated,0.7432569
by hatred for anyone of a different race anyone that's different than them but the,0.48587397
same time they're decently well organized and skeptical of anyone who may prove damaging to,0.1498129
their cause the story gets odd because the way the detectives actually infiltrate the KKK,0.1533275
chapter is kind of remarkably bad so bad that the villains never truly considered it,0.17412864
as a possibility because it just made no logical sense that's where a lot of,0.087955475
the humor comes in something else that black Klansmen does fairly well I'm not gonna,0.4504375
say this is a hilarious film or anything like that but there certainly are scenes,0.113892935
that are pretty funny and sort of lighten the mood every now and then what's,0.08734409
interesting though is that a lot of this humor feels very Tarantino like a lot,0.10551957
of the movie does actually a way less violent Tarantino though it's just comfortable poking,0.09433132
fun at taboo subject matter like racism and it does so in a way that,0.37192094
feels sort of awkwardly light-hearted it's to start contrast with the more serious tones that,0.047233377
resonate more deeply and more often but it actually does provide a nice change of,0.044206936
pace overall John David Washington and Adam driver both to a nice job of being,0.055596016
funny but also being dramatic as well the versatility carries the movie quite a bit,0.1281558
because they're asked to show off different skill sets at different times and it all,0.043547526
works super well John David Washington and Adam driver actually do a lot of the,0.062954254
heavy lifting here John David Washington handles the lead duties for the first act and,0.06792114
then as the film progresses sort of becomes like a co-lead situation where he and,0.056107476
Adam drivers share the responsibilities and share the spotlight they both have tons of great,0.05075512
moments and while I don't think either these performances are ultimately going to be Academy,0.05784491
nominated performances the both still really good some of the best I've seen this year,0.044688113
thus far I've only ever seen John David Washington in the HBO show ballers where,0.06621091
he plays a supporting character but I have a feeling he's gonna start laying some,0.080327205
bigger roles after his great work in this movie Adam driver is just continuing to,0.060828723
impress me more and more with each passing film in fact I think he's getting,0.1148057
better with each passing film this time around he plays a character with a subtlety,0.104765356
and nuance that works very well in conjunction with John David Washington's performance it's a,0.03187297
little more in-your-face but still awesome speaking of subtlety and nuance I think this is,0.2958591
one area where black Klansmen could probably improve I felt locked in for a lot,0.24102892
of the film really engaged to the setting and the oddball nature of the story,0.12043238
and the hopeful downfall of this local KKK chapter they're showing us where the film,0.15283692
took me out of the experience though is when it comes across as if it's,0.0773377
trying too hard to say something meaningful about issues we face in today's climate and,0.06566923
then there probably was a way to do this a little more subtly a little,0.06590498
more naturally but sadly that's just not Spike Lee's style at points in this film,0.082922086
there's moments where I felt sucked out of the immersive aspects because I just felt,0.27760038
the directors political end goals too clearly present in the source material it feels less,0.061685998
like a movie at that point and more like a political lecture which is something,0.07802104
that I'm personally not really looking for out of a movie going experience if you,0.10753139
can weave it in nacho to the story and then more power to you that's,0.057544157
great but if you're forceful about it it just kind of kills the immersion when,0.4709155
it happens something else Spike Lee does here that bothered me a bit was the,0.12586041
seemingly intentional means of editing the choppy there's that time the lack of continuity between,0.11120787
cuts especially when two or three characters are just talking to one another and there's,0.054417502
a method where text is used in a way that feels out of sync with,0.06656531
the rest of the film the editing is perfectly fine oftentimes but it's sometimes just,0.094987005
awkward and that's another place where the emergence uppers a bit because of that it,0.1527585
seems like an artistic decision because it's done in deliberate moments to add a sort,0.091809765
of awkward charm to the 70's style film but it just feels off the editing,0.07838609
choices aren't always the greatest with this one that said there are a lot of,0.0531484
things I really liked about black clansmen and I do think it has a very,0.13566923
powerful message the message to me was that racism is real and that it evolves,0.31089434
and changes over time to take new forms as society changes and evolves itself I,0.107698016
also took away that racism and hatred can lead to isolation on both sides this,0.31089434
kind of division only creates more division and more animosity between people that shouldn't ever,0.100433975
feel any of those things towards each other simply because of the color of their,0.2159982
skin this was an extremely tumultuous time for african-americans especially and in response many of,0.15491986
them felt the need to defend themselves it's a natural reaction and it makes sense,0.054278526
if you feel threatened but I think the film tries to sort of point out,0.096037395
how both sides just retreat further and further into their own sides and just hate,0.2118915
each other with the gap that widens even further day by day there's just a,0.1717305
lot to digest here and it's mostly insightful and effective overall though I found black,0.23351388
Klansmen to be a very good film certainly one of the better ones I've seen,0.06590421
this year I don't think it's quite gonna make it to the Oscar discussion but,0.050579276
you never know it has a powerful enough message that it just might as for,0.09986341
the pros cons for the pros I thought black Klansmen delivered a well-rounded and unique,0.16484243
historical story lots of insightful commentary on important topics two great leading performances and some,0.034312803
nice humor that balances the entire experience as for the cons I found the film,0.055753466
lacks subtlety in certain key spots and it's editing choices weren't the greatest I'm still,0.22101611
gonna give black plans but a nine out of ten because I think the pros,0.2407934
outweigh the cons here if you're interested in a historical drama film with the quality,0.14862247
message this is a good choice so did you guys see black Klansmen yet what,0.36863205
did you think of it and if not let me know why not I'd almost,0.10307553
let me know the movie you're most looking forward to that's coming out in 2018,0.10670809
I'll drop mine in the comments below because I honestly got a thing long and,0.26053727
hard about that one either way this is wolf box if occations iding off see,0.23978372
