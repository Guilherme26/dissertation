hey everybody today I am going to be reviewing rear window this film came out,0.24229202
in 1954 and it was directed by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950s where Hitchcock really,0.053105656
hit his stride where he had the most creative control and he really didn't work,0.2931205
his way through the ranks people tend to forget that but he had been working,0.071996816
a long long time you know he had one or sorry Rebecca the film Rebecca,0.06795623
had won best picture at the Academy Awards I think 14 years prior and little,0.050637245
by little he built his signature style and then it kind of came to fruition,0.11331158
became most prominent in the 50s at this point he was making movies like strangers,0.092966065
on a train which I love and films like dial M for murder which is,0.2556948
quite similar to this film in the sense that it is about a murder and,0.21702598
it all for the most part takes place in one area like a play and,0.070163
it also stars Grace Kelly I don't think it's as mature thematically as rear-window would,0.15122429
absolutely worth your time and then along comes through window which is of course one,0.11327037
of his more memorable works any time that somebody I know somebody who maybe has,0.07065212
never seen a Hitchcock film I usually tend to recommend this one for them to,0.09026623
start out with just because I feel as though it really encapsulates everything that hitch,0.112037525
is about in terms of what he wants to say and many of us don't,0.055337466
have that thematic thread that carry throughout a lot of his films but I feel,0.14163625
like this one is is kind of going a little bit deeper and in yet,0.114
it's still very entertaining it's still very mainstream rear-window is in many ways just a,0.14826758
commentary on the act of viewing a film a commentary on the audience as warriors,0.065423585
and I think that the movie brings those ideas out in in ways that are,0.114205234
very sophisticated just in in terms of the storytelling and of course building that slow,0.11258645
tension in a way that only Hitchcock really could at that time the idea itself,0.14987224
is an ingenious premise having your protagonist be immobile the James Stewart character has broken,0.11217622
his leg and he's he's stuck in his apartment in the middle of the summer,0.15392788
to pass the time he watches his neighbors in his apartment complex with his little,0.106101334
binoculars he sees all of their different stories makes judgments about them and all of,0.07514789
that and then he begins to suspect that one of his neighbors might be involved,0.12885343
in a murder but he doesn't have the concrete evidence to back this up it's,0.4033515
just great it's the perfect mystery thriller set up the film opens with one those,0.051814523
classic Hitchcock shots where he sets up all you need to know in one single,0.4033532
shot he's really really good at this we see the entire apartment complex we get,0.4935256
a very good indication of who each neighbor is just in this one shot which,0.08972063
is also mirrored in the last shot of the film as well where it comes,0.058562282
full circle and then we move into the apartment where we see James Stewart and,0.040365092
we see that he has a broken leg that he's confined to a wheelchair and,0.32391146
this is all in one shot everything is set up exactly everything you need to,0.15115863
know and again this is all in one shot you know we see everything that,0.44293222
we need to see there's nothing superfluous there's nothing to break it up and we,0.0965467
don't need any other information other than that it's pretty perfect one thing that I,0.10667496
really love is that the majority of everything that you hear in the film is,0.046948083
diegetic it's all within the world of the film most of the music and all,0.6240453
of the sounds and all of that so the characters are always conscious of it,0.070826106
and you don't see that very often in movies you usually hear like a musical,0.08465068
score I'm very used to hearing this big sweeping Bernard Herrmann's score when I you,0.19274221
know see a Hitchcock film of course that was kind of before that point but,0.09136255
still but here you don't get that you know hear you all the sounds that,0.08238621
you hear for the most part are from radios they're from cars you hear the,0.06572612
piano being played by the the composer the pianist on the bottom floor you hear,0.09401823
car honks and sirens and the way each sound is employed right at the perfect,0.08360221
moment to build the suspense is quite ingenious they put a lot of effort into,0.06691252
the sound design and that's quite evident because the sounds are really aligning with what,0.03535093
happened on-screen and not in a way where it's like hammering you over the head,0.3066457
it's not overwrought in any way it just kind of paints the perfect backdrop for,0.21323484
the subject it just all adds to the the immediacy it really immerses you in,0.089732885
that world and you know as I said I love the Hitchcock scores they are,0.10978192
iconic a lot of them but this one does not need a score and in,0.11479883
the same way that the birds really didn't need to score either it's a way,0.04309141
to play with the tension a way to play with the expectations of the audience,0.05409642
when you have like a diegetic music and stuff like that in place of a,0.6665623
score there's a lot less of the manipulation going on of course there always is,0.08881416
going to be manipulating manipulation when you're watching a movie but this one is a,0.15459323
little bit different scores purposely help to guide the viewer and they help you to,0.059857666
evoke certain emotions our times and here you just don't really have that luxury so,0.09714063
a woman can be getting strangled you know in the window across from the James,0.5154597
Stewart character and you'll likely hear something like smooth jazz or something that is very,0.06298061
out of place and it's it's disturbing but very realistic and of course that makes,0.07779093
it feel a little bit wrong a little bit more disturbing and constantly throughout the,0.18684325
movie all the different characters around the protagonist are off they're always asking him why,0.059264198
are you doing this and you know are you sure you should be peeking into,0.08529247
these people's lives the way you are at what point does it go too far,0.10169978
James Stewart is the perfect protagonist to play the the Geoffrey's character because he is,0.036059126
and I mean he was at the time one of those guys that everybody loved,0.09901847
he he stood for the everyman so it's it's perfect casting he represents the audience,0.067254394
in the same way that like Kyle McLaughlin represented the audience in Bluebell but as,0.032037117
lawyers it's the person who gets to sit back and watch everything take place no,0.14014734
matter how disturbing and they are in complete control whereas everything outside is not and,0.083324246
as lawyers we can vicariously live through the characters on the screen in movies right,0.09664009
you know we project our own feelings and our own stories on to them and,0.053722084
to me that's a very powerful thing about movies and just about art in general,0.061434325
I think that sort of thing has the power to change people's lives in the,0.18384153
way that they view the world and even in this movie seeing all the different,0.11112771
neighbors through their windows it's like each window is its own little movie screen or,0.06956311
they even look like panels in a comic book and I think that's really cool,0.1940302
because you know really movies are sort of windows into a different world aren't they,0.080276266
and so that really illustrates that idea I think that the perfect example of the,0.056150686
voyeurism here though would be with the Miss Lonelyhearts character she's a woman who lives,0.17512769
on the bottom floor she's middle-aged and she's a very lonely person and we start,0.31089434
to see progressively throughout the movie that she is suicidal she's aging and she doesn't,0.31089434
have anybody special in her life Jeffries feels sympathetic of course but maybe at the,0.18818305
same time he might see what he might become because you know in the movie,0.08518279
there's that dynamic between him and the Lisa character played by Grace Kelly the idea,0.058774766
of will he marry her won't he and I think Lisa also when she sees,0.14115214
Miss Lonelyhearts she also kind of feels the same way it's that fear of of,0.1096213
being sad and alone but they get to peek into this person's life without her,0.24153414
knowing and they get to project their own story their own feelings about their own,0.04461056
relationship on to her but then there's that tinge of sourness that comes with that,0.10618069
as well you know because it's it's at that point that Lisa begins to question,0.05248405
whether or not she should be watching this sort of stuff because there is that,0.07944024
kind of sadistic quality of getting to see people go through such anguish but it,0.696197
still gives you that control getting to see somebody else and live their life and,0.15310133
all of that and while you can feel for them you don't have to directly,0.09312374
be involved in their lives so it gives you that that great control and we,0.11542896
want that feeling without experience that experiencing it directly and you know classic horror tropes,0.21273448
of people being butcher humiliated tortured all of that it's for us as viewers it's,0.559065
cathartic it arouses our emotions in such a way but again it's it's in a,0.12551855
controlled environment we know we're gonna be okay at the end of the day we're,0.056160036
not gonna get butchered ourselves and I think that's perfectly normal to a certain extent,0.24222703
but at what point does all of that start to become gratuitous and when does,0.063070655
it become unnecessary it starts to reveal a certain level of cynicism and darkness within,0.35976094
us that we may need to examine another thing that I really kind of think,0.078077726
is cool about this movie and I didn't really think about until watching it this,0.07581963
last time is just the way that the characters as they're watching the neighbors how,0.033801824
they make assumptions about them and it's the same with us you know the way,0.06246737
we judge people as boyars Jeffries sees all of these people around him but he,0.11979209
doesn't know their whole stories all he can do is really infer based on what,0.067746066
he sees beyond that his knowledge is unreliable as is ours as audience members we,0.10712098
only see what we're shown and we don't really know these characters and that's part,0.05843892
of why the murder is so interesting because we really don't know whether or not,0.23962934
he's truly seeing what he thinks he's seen and there are moments in the dialogue,0.08366356
where we see all that reflected naturally you know like where the Thelma Ritter character,0.07274603
says that we should look inward sometimes for a change and and their Grace Kelly,0.058249857
a character saying that you know it's really kind of disease that you've got all,0.34068704
of these opinions about these people that you don't even know and you know it's,0.19081534
a good thing that she's not alive in the millennial generation all of these factor,0.31089434
into what we perceive as viewers ourselves and how that can that can be kind,0.0938789
of dangerous so of course hitch is very conscious of the way he's manipulating us,0.15790084
he always has been he's always kind of seen that is as funny to him,0.100247614
he's amused by the way he can pull the strings with audience members it gives,0.117133796
him complete control but I think here is kind of the first kind of tip,0.12316227
into a different direction where he's starting to really explore that idea more and we,0.049299985
see that go way further in films like like vertigo which came out a few,0.17226572
years later he started to make those connections about artists as commentary on society not,0.09389013
only does this movie implement those devices really exquisitely but it's also just I mean,0.12991747
it's just really entertaining on a basic level and you know I think that the,0.10495853
script like a lot of the films around this time that he's making the script,0.15305048
is just really witty the characters are are so likeable and relatable which is is,0.08836572
key everything is choreographed and so meticulously well built as I said and I love,0.06067367
that he's pushing himself a little bit more and I do think this is one,0.2423399
of his better films for sure and yeah if you've never seen a Hitchcock movie,0.09941947
this is a great place to start and that is my review thank you all,0.04689752
