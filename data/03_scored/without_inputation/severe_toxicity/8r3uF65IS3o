of layers and visually you just got to see it with your eyes I mean,0.06739108
the is poetry on screen and this movie is no different because this is not,0.015525387
only one of the best looking and gorgeous looking films of the entire year made,0.04999454
a film that has a lot of visual subtext and a lot of visual storytelling,0.024185412
that will go unnoticed unless you're actually paying attention it's not enough to say that,0.02225904
this movie is eggs on a tip beautiful I mean duh of course it is,0.104016095
Guillermo del Toro always has a beautiful looking movie I like what he did with,0.07864732
the lighting and the contrasts in this film somehow it's a little bit more of,0.0331022
a grounded reality in this film it takes place in the 1960s so it's not,0.03365763
as much of a fantastical epic as you're used to seeing from guillermo del toro,0.06775893
but somehow in a grounded fantasy it's still somehow manages to pop visually I'm not,0.017000098
entirely sure how he and the cinematographer did that for this film but kudos to,0.014175729
both of those guys Foreman says in this film are so goddamn good that I,0.40906066
don't think it's enough for me to get out of this review and not say,0.04211743
that every single one of the main principle characters and actors in this film need,0.013442696
to be nominated for something give a damn if it's a Golden Globe I don't,0.3231999
give a damn if it's an Oscar I don't care if someone just draws a,0.37638465
picture of a golden statue and a piece of paper and hands it to them,0.13932538
and says you were awesome because guess what everybody in this movie was freaking awesome,0.15610397
Sally Hawkins was mesmerizing as the main character of Eliza she doesn't say anything in,0.043956667
the movie she can't talk obviously because she's mute but her facial reactions and her,0.24471065
eyes tell everything they tell the entire story all I can really say about her,0.034030795
performance in this movie is that she moves mountains emotionally without saying a single word,0.068382874
everyone else was really great in the movie to Octavia Spencer I mean she just,0.065409504
adds something to every movie that she's in she has some very funny parts she,0.09880571
has some very welcome levity and human though she brought some humor there's also some,0.075977944
very touching and heartfelt moments with her character too and I would say that her,0.07922005
character just like most of the other characters in this film are trying to find,0.011619428
themselves in someone else they're trying to find some part of themselves trying to find,0.022338197
something that they've lost within themselves and they're trying to see it reflected in someone,0.07408882
else her character represents that too Jones is great as this amphibian sea creature monster,0.29208905
whatever the hell this thing is prosthetics and the design of the creature are very,0.22549732
well done and Doug Jones does a lot of miming and a lot of hand,0.044440918
movements and a lot of eye twitches and I decided to describe and all I,0.044177506
can know is that Doug Jones was great in this movie Michael Shannon oh my,0.02533751
god to do is just I hate him in this movie Michael Sata does such,0.36004323
a great job at playing a great villain we have seen that in other films,0.03968419
that he's done but in this movie in particular he was such a slimeball oh,0.27358505
my god I absolutely hated Michael Shannon in this movie I hated him I just,0.30332997
I despised him at a cellular level he was awful he was disgusting he made,0.3398964
me sick to my stomach but I I just I couldn't turn away from the,0.064504854
screen while he was on it even though this is a film that seems like,0.041059125
it has a simple issue story to it it's a romance between a monster and,0.13703315
a girl who can't speak it seems kind of simple but there are so many,0.085363016
layers and themes and subtext interwoven throughout the narrative of the script and the screenplay,0.020653952
that just make this movie pop on a more emotional level and on a more,0.03102749
so Libra level than your typical Beauty meets the Beast type of story there are,0.22550735
some very subtle references in ways that the film brings up and addresses things that,0.009653145
are not only prevalent in our society today but we're also prevalent during that era,0.023965236
in the 1960s there are some heavy themes about prejudice about judging somebody who's different,0.014667965
than you subconscious prejudices that we have about people even what we don't say anything,0.05124974
it also says a lot about people with disabilities and the way we take people,0.09281108
like that for granted and the way that sometimes not saying things is sometimes the,0.015744897
most powerful statement that a person can make a real issue with this movie is,0.026580738
that the movie does hit a lull sometime between the second act and the third,0.04965995
act there's a point in the movie where the story is going along and then,0.011911443
something happens and then the story just kind of stops for a little bit and,0.03624386
there's a little bit of a lull there's not much going on from a story,0.03249688
perspective it's not that the story comes to a crashing halt it's just kind of,0.044498127
like a plane circling overhead it's just it's it's hovering it's not really going anywhere,0.045851108
