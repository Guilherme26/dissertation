so we've had enough time to soak in the movie black panther came out I believe February 16th of this month,0.15452175
did I really just say I said February 16th of this month it came out this month and I just saw it for the second time and I plan to go see it again,0.0491605
this weekend just to get my one last my one last shot and I've done this with a few movies like Rise of the Planet of the Apes interstellar the wolf of Wall Street I've done this with a couple movies not tons that I will literally go back and see like multiple multiple times,0.39526823
and I know Black Panther is probably the most anticipated movie of 2018 judging by how I perform at the box-office judging by you know the the reception on social media on review platform,0.084835425
so I wanted to make this video just to give my take on the movie the reception,0.17413408
you know responding the reception and just a quick overview of what the film was about I know,0.04096983
a lot of people wanted to know my thoughts on it,0.075923756
so here,0.058199726
we go Black Panther for those who don't know is a Marvel superhero,0.33745864
but in this movie touch all the the protagonists here is portrayed less as a hero and more of a a king with very internal conflicts,0.09786963
so the film basically starts off in California and hood and T'Challa father goes to see his brother two toddlers uncle and the conversation starts off good but it ends up turning into a berating session when when two challahs uncle realizes that the the his right-hand man has been a spy for from Wakanda the entire time and the movie pretty much starts out with an Jobu arguing that black people in general will fare a lot better just in that country in that system if they had the tools necessary to prop themselves up above the rest,0.18100128
he acknowledges that there is a lot of segregation a lot of racial divide and attempt to prevent certain people from prevailing by not giving them the same tools as other people within that same land,0.18216193
so he's the one who's basically giving that information to claw the film essentially starts off like that that's gonna be the the precursor for majority,0.056913093
of the conflict within the Black Panther movie all you idiots,0.92892706
in the comment section that we're going crazy talking about oh man,0.40335712
y'all really think Black Panther is gonna be about black people to some extent like shut up,0.74676716
you haven't even seen the film yet and why wouldn't it be a statement about that,0.06446176
it's obvious you looks too - Chawla after reuniting with Nakia goes back to Wakanda - you know except his place on,0.22389747
the throne he's challenged by Baku who I don't really like the challenging system in this movie,0.092732355
at all I mean if the purpose of this movie is to be ruled by a,0.07190534
good king I thought you should have been judged by character not by brawn or by,0.15018316
brute strength if that is the case anyone with any whacked-out ideology could easily take the throne unless of course they're saying you have to be from a specific tribe in order to be up,0.19429412
for consideration guess kill monger from what I know went,0.57569
into it and was able to challenge - Charla pretty much based off his bloodline as we continue in the film were introduced to,0.074801885
characters like Everett,0.053010862
what kabhi a Cole a Sheree,0.16067713
I would say there are elements of this movie that actually reminds me of The Dark Knight Rises,0.083302826
the woody sarcastic responses from shiri are kind of what I would get from an Alfred or or a fox,0.30997044
she's like the combination of those two characters in my opinion,0.15333733
so I think her character is awesome although the fight between Batman and Bane was pretty anti-climatic in my opinion,0.16680732
there is a defeat of T'Challa arise and a defeat of Erich kill monger as we progressed with the film were introduced to Erich kill monger who was portrayed by Michael B Jordan in this film we find out the Erik's true goal was never to work under Klaw,0.26289347
it was just to offer Klaus a sacrifice to Wakanda so that he could be taken to see T'Challa so that he could challenge him so that he could become the king take the throne and thence in vibranium to other places of the world so that their people could all thrive in all nations,0.19042465
I'm very empathetic towards a character like Erik kill monger because when you look at him you see someone who is a product not only of their environment but someone who wants to see their people thrive,0.471033
you can see with his time in office although short lives was not spent tormenting the people of Wakanda it was spent honestly trying to use their resources,0.16880381
Erik kill monger went about his process in a completely wrong way you see that he ended up taking the wrong approach,0.508063
which ultimately led to his downfall,0.30336845
unfortunately Erik tries to be a dictator as opposed to trying to be a king,0.3741058
and that's probably one of the biggest downfalls of the movie itself is that Erik kill monger doesn't come at this from a very strategic standpoint at all for him to have been working towards this goal for so long you would have thought he would have better planned,0.32689
it maybe tried to get more people on his side,0.11155089
maybe try to get more of what condemnation to understand him,0.111254014
I feel like his methods would have been better accepted had he come at this from the standpoint of a king and less of a dictator,0.3368354
I have to give props to what in my opinion,0.07933671
maybe the most underrated character in this entire movie and it might possibly be the best portray as a koi a that's played by Danai gurira,0.05491392
i think her name is in every scene she's in she dominates in the comedic effect and the sarcastic effect and the action affect her fight scenes are probably the best in the entire film of course,0.096621096
there's not a lot of emphasis put on her character as she is a side character,0.111333735
but still she does the best in this movie to me and she's the most badass,0.35177192
she literally uses one of her Spears to hold on to the top of the car that is being driven by Nikita in an attempt to catch claw in harpoons a truck,0.1637215
another thing to point out about Erik kill monger is his resolve he literally kills his girlfriend or his love interest which immediately reminds me of the Sasuke that was pulled on our tail where he tells Kody and everything's gonna be okay and stabs her through the heart just to get danza,0.5606536
some of you might not know what that is I'm a bit of a weeaboo but still it shows how clear-cut his method to get revenge is he finally meets up with the charla they fight,0.4700572
- Charlie loses in a really really bad,0.20334396
way Zuri is also killed in this fight which to me I guess is impactful for T'Challa as far as the audience is,0.3258401
concerned I don't think we had enough time with Zuri to really care about him dying like,0.18817915
that and I would have thought Erik kill monger would have taken his time with Zuri since he is the one who ended up getting his father killed he throws to Chara over the edge takes his place on the throne in decisis to send vibranium or weapons with vibranium to the rest of the,0.60504186
world so that black people all over the world can thrive and survive and be on top of course,0.71449727
we find out that Sharla isn't actually dead,0.20203786
he's actually saved by Baku Nakia ends up getting,0.09153355
one of the heart-shaped herbs trying to give it to Baku because she doesn't actually know that T'Challa is alive once they figure it out,0.16621085
they give it a shower,0.10636636
he wakes up,0.13317056
he's ready to fight,0.31089434
he goes back home ready to take one kill monger everyone fights,0.78785956
all this movie proved your allies become your enemy,0.26869118
there was no other army this is literally just whoa copy and a koi yay end up fighting pretty much their army is pretty much on the battlefield,0.0968018
no one else is here,0.104748555
the real enemy is kill monger in the east one guy to Chawla and kill monger have their round two to Chawla wins by stabbing Erik in the heart,0.5154597
he's in praised by kil monger because apparently you know flipping over a knife and stabbing me in the heart with it was a good move,0.66966254
instead of just killing him on the spot T'Challa takes Eric to a sunset because that's what his father has always wanted him to see he sees it,0.6129353
he acknowledges it as beautiful vintage,0.1606769
Charlotte says hey we can still save you Eric kill monger delivers what might be the best line in any Marvel movie in history before his death just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped off the boats because they knew death was better than bondage and that one line right,0.53739655
there proves the entire difference between the character T'Challa and Eric kill monger one who wants to see his people free and one who wants to see his people exist T'Challa ends up taking on Eric kill mongers methods in the end of the film by going back to California in the hood and buying a couple establishments in order to help out their situation,0.33088702
and that's essentially the movie in what I could say I hope was about five minutes,0.08826734
so after seeing it twice,0.06595633
there were a few things that I definitely could appreciate one of those things first being the connection between how Black Panther and Wakanda deals with immigrants,0.17395824
and how America deals with immigrants the whole purpose of Wakanda was to preserve and protect their own people,0.14933354
they really got into anyone else's business and they made sure to stay secluded from the rest of the world here at kill monger references this in the film you guys are up here sitting nice and pretty but our people are out there dying and in the street and their excuses,0.3695249
we don't know who they are,0.1308846
and we can't have people coming in here that could threaten our lives and immediately there's a connection between that and how America is dealing with the current immigration situation unfortunately though for America what Conda has never participated in any other world events while America has another thing I love about this movie is how it holds on the African culture like those African roots while still advancing at the same time truly you can still hold the one two something in an advance simultaneously,0.2532717
it's an afro futuristic film one that pays a lot of homage to the African lineage while also saying hey we can you know keep up with the times as well another selling point for this film is how much stronger,0.1642078
the Wakanda people seem to be from knowing their path thus knowing what should be important in what to protect having responsibilities etc,0.09058735
you see Eric kill monger in this film was a lot angrier he he has a point to prove there is nothing that he really values,0.6210385
I mean in the beginning of the film he even destroys his own love interest,0.25895157
there is nothing that this dude holds close to him and that's because he doesn't know who he is,0.20898215
he doesn't know what he wants to protect he has a goal in mind of wanting people to have come out of a certain situation,0.14879261
but unlike the people of Wakanda he doesn't actually know who he is or where he stems from which makes his character even better because he can identify what those are the people that live in America that have no idea where they come from either,0.08838892
I mean watching this film it makes you really upset if you were ever here that argument from someone that you shouldn't be upset about slavery,0.24405259
because you weren't affected by it do,0.08845274
I don't even know my last name,0.10360053
I can't go back ten generations and still know exactly where I stem from any man or woman is a million times greater when they know who they are versus when they do not and we currently have millions of black youth in America who have no idea who they are of course,0.47013175
you can define and shape yourself to be the person you want to be I'm just saying lineage wise knowing where you come from knowing who you are knowing who your ancestors were we can't obtain access to that information but it's not available just on the fly,0.058865186
we were raised and brought up learning European culture we weren't brought up learning African culture learning,0.16260847
what gods were worshipped learning what internal conflict happened with African nations early on we didn't learn that stuff,0.11960717
and there wasn't easy access to it,0.04322062
when you were 9 10 11 years old that's the thing,0.24136311
that's so bittersweet about this movie is even though it's fiction it tells a story of what could have been had we as black people knew respected valued then advanced our culture the amount of lists that could have evinced an entire civilization is maddening to think about the wealth the culture the identity crisis,0.416567
we be ending the sense of helplessness we'd be ending and the idea of togetherness that we'd be sparking when you look at a movie like this it's just like so motivating to see this many black people just living in a nation together and just supporting one another even those people like Baku who disagree with the challahs method still have a place where they can call home you know this movie impacts in a different way than just something,0.42368448
that's supposed to be a superhero movie because in the film I like out to Chara isn't represented as a black panther like a superhero but more as the conflict within his own nation,0.16268285
I got to tell you people that I went to go see this movie with we were said we reset when we left the theater because we we acknowledged and looked at that and saw like this this could this could have happened this could have been us of course not superhuman strength or anything like that but having a nation where all of us support one another without having something as devastating as being enslaved and having your identity in your history stripped from you and forced to settle in that same country is,0.10465644
it's really maddening,0.30315298
if things have been another way like it sucks of course we can make that happen still but there's way too many of us that have already been colonized,0.5217296
I just love the duality of this movie I love how Eric Gill monger is portrayed and how T'Challa is portrayed one character with a father one that knows his history one that knows exactly who he is,0.100959286
and what he needs to protect versus,0.07587398
one who doesn't know his history,0.09095313
doesn't know exactly where he stems from doesn't really know,0.06160656
what to protect has a vision has no one to guide him or hadn't had anyone to guide him because he's fatherless grew up in the u.s.,0.1958364
that's more of a common story in the u.s.,0.09932146
it shows a parallel,0.10344404
I feel of one black man that could end up this way if he had this in one that could end up this way if he doesn't have this,0.5154597
so I love the movie for the discussion that it sparks in the conversation that it brings up especially us as black people,0.4635631
you know looking at it from that point of view,0.0644165
there's so much about the film that you can appreciate be a little bit saddened by at the same time,0.10726664
but of course with all things none of this is perfect although I do praise this movie for its strong statement,0.0825764
there are elements of the film that I just could have done without one of those elements being the really crappy at moment CGI,0.31089434
that's done with the film,0.053934436
especially during the fight with Eric kill monger and T'Challa sometimes it's just noticeably,0.48453632
oh six like really bad graphics at some points,0.2171927
and I know a lot of people might not notice it,0.10530366
but if you have a friend who's like a graphic designer or if you've watched movies that really focus highly on that quality like if you've seen the movie interstellar you'll see how beautiful cinematically these movies look I think the camerawork is amazing,0.1559727
I love the way though the land looks it's beautiful although there are some good acting in the film I do think that at some points,0.06434775
Michael B Jordan,0.08144351
scared Aric kill monger is a little bit over acted,0.43285435
there's sometimes heavy emphasis placed on lines that are just awkward to me like when Eric says he's gonna kill T'Challa or when he's stripping himself down getting ready to fight,0.45076436
I get that he's angry but at some moments in the film the anger doesn't come off authentic,0.10369677
it comes off as very forced,0.11737866
there are some moments in the film where Michael B Jordan acting does redeem itself like the opening scene where he first gets introduced where he's acting very normal and everything seems to just roll off the tongue especially is hey auntie lion when he goes and meets up with T'Challa that was hilarious,0.10051425
and I might speak to that not being,0.10234434
who Michael B Jordan really is I mean maybe Chadwick Boseman was so easily portrayed as T'Challa in the film because that's a lot of who he really is another thing in this film that I didn't really like was Klaw being executed,0.21564622
so early in the film I mean for him to have caused so much havoc in regards to what Conda for him to be taken out so easily in for him to not expect it was just really weird to me you have a guy here who has information about what Conda who who's got someone on the inside,0.10616918
and he doesn't expect to be betrayed at any point,0.15217137
I think he's killed literally like within,0.64751154
the first 40 minutes of the film the fight scenes are a little bit anticlimactic,0.19017571
now I did actually enjoy the fight scene between T'Challa and Baku he had his own good reason for won in a fight to chala just feeling like T'Challa isn't a good leader having technical developments be from a child pretty much was one of his main concerns,0.10756308
so everything,0.06061433
he was saying was reasonable he also put up a good fight,0.16333485
but he's spared by de Charla in the end how the fight scenes that T'Challa actually participates in,0.15715976
I think that was the best one the fight between him and Erik kill monger is really anti climactic in the end for me not a lot is going on not a lot is happening correct me,0.40317577
if I'm wrong but if they are having their powers of the Black Panthers set before they begin fighting,0.27389896
why wasn't T'Challa a little bit more hurt after he was stabbed in the chest by a spear from Baku do walk that off like he didn't even get touched same thing happened when he was thrown off,0.32308325
a cliff dude had every inch of his body sliced open and then was thrown off of a cliff from however many stories high and somehow manages to have his body recover another question I have about this film is if kill monger burned all the heart-shaped herbs in T'Challa pretty much has the last one can they just make more or is that just the end of the Black Panther,0.24772358
I have my discrepancies with it obviously I have my issues,0.14298828
maybe there's some plot holes here,0.14942591
and there maybe some things that I don't like like the CGI being bad,0.13407019
especially during some of the fight scenes I just think the good really outweighs the bad in this film to me and for everything that this film says and for all the possibilities that you could walk out of the theater thinking about after viewing it,0.11146752
I think it deserves what I'm about to give it black panther the movie thank you guys for watching,0.39383817
if you enjoyed the movie please go watch it again,0.09361727
go watch it one,0.09137982
more time support this movie,0.073345974
it's made amazing money,0.08256651
so far,0.045934796
I want to see it reach a billion it probably will be I'm going to go see it again,0.07193964
this weekend just to get one last good look at it I've already seen it twice,0.06402647
but I want to see it one more time,0.06548349
I hope you guys did enjoy the film,0.116302915
