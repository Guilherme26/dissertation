so I just drove three hours total to see a three and a half hour movie in the theater so that's six and a half hours of my time was it worth it what does that flick fans and welcome back to my channel today we're talking about the brand new Netflix original film the Irishman this thing drops on Netflix on the 27th I fortunately found a theater that was semi closed to me and I said you know what I'm going today we're going to talk about it let me know in the comments are you a fan of Martin Scorsese and were you excited for this film let's talk about it so world war ii veteran and mob hitman Frank the Irishman Sheeran recalls his possible involvement with the story of union leader Jimmy Hoffa in honesty time I love Martin Scorsese one of the best directors clearly working right now and some of the best actors of all time in this movie together I was excited for this film but not as excited as some others because I was um I was nervously hesitant because of the integration of this D aging technology and the fact that this film is so long it's going to Netflix there were just so many things that we're making me nervous and I saw the trailer and I really liked the trailer but I'm like huh I'm just I'm not excited as I should be once again Martin Scorsese Robert DeNiro Al Pacino ha Joe Pesci Harvey Keitel oh my good go on for days Bobby Cannavale II Ray Romano everyone is in this film and it is a movie that is very long like I said three and a half hours actually past that especially if you are like me and you're just sitting through the credits go on you just gotta take a breath after a movie like this because it really knocks the breath out of you this is the story of one man's entire life not necessarily from beginning to end but it focuses on the reflection of Frank's life what he did to build up to that integral moment in the film and then the aftermath right it's not just boom and the movies over no we get time to sit and breathe and really think about what just happened it feels like every time we get an intense moment and trust me some of the most intense moments you will see all year are in this film we get chance to reflect upon it think about it for five to ten minutes with our characters and let me tell you guys the acting in this movie is as good as you were anticipating it to be Robert De Niro is fantastic Joe Pesci he's back it's so good to see him back playing a very different character normally or most of the time when people think of Joe Pesci and a Martin Scorsese movie they think of the exaggerated and over-the-top character that's what Al Pacino gives us in this film which is similar to what he normally does but Pesci plays a very more subdued character he's kind of the guy in charge this time and everything runs through him and I really like seeing that side of him not that we're going to see him again in the future because he's been out of the game for a while he came back for this film and oh my gosh does he not absolutely kill it so those two actors were on top of their game but my favorite performance may actually be Al Pacino even though he is playing a similar character to what we've seen him play before Jimmy Hoffa is a different person with different intentions in this guy man any time he gets let off of his leash he goes crazy he talks so much in this movie and he's always talking people out of how they feel and talking them back into how he feels that's just the kind of guy that Jimmy Hoffa is and they even say in the movie not a lot of young kids are going to know who Jimmy Hoffa is after this film if you all get the opportunity to see it even if it is on Netflix not on a big screen everyone know who Jimmy Hoffa is because Al Pacino is phenomenal in this movie just incredible and Scorsese's Direction is as good as you anticipate it to be now it is a different feeling film it even looks different from his previous more recent efforts you compare this to something like wolf of wallstreet it's like wolf of wallstreet has a very specific color palette and has a very specific over-the-top exaggerated look to it I love that movie so much this is very different this is a movie starring older gentleman it's not necessarily going to be for the young crowd if they just look at it watch five minutes ago it's not for me give this film a chance because even though this is a movie intended for the older crowd or intended for Scorsese fans like myself I think everyone can get something out of this film even if you don't relate to our main character in Frank who does you know make mistakes in his life and then at the end of the film he is reflecting upon this and saying what did I do wrong and I love the way that this story is told I love how they go about his relationship with his daughter even though they don't flesh it out in the manner even from what I'm saying you expect them to flesh it out but they do it very very subtly now if I have one complaint about that story it's the fact that Anna Paquin who plays his daughter the older version did not get a lot of screen time with De Niro now there is a reason for that but I could have used more with that story maybe just one conversation or one moment with her to speak a bit more because we did not get a lot from her but that storyline was integral because you continuously feel how he feels those looks just those really subtle moments that he's giving his daughter all throughout the movie you feel that and that's what I'll say about this film it makes you feel it makes you reflect even if you're not that age and we'll talk about the de-aging here in just a second you're thinking about your entire life this movie makes you think about death and the consequences of death not a spoiler it's a mob movie but it's a very different mob movie a lot of people are going to compare this to Goodfellas maybe before they see the film and it's an understandable comparison because they are two mob based movies with someone kind of telling us the story as we go along in a non expositional way it's important exposition there is a difference between bad exposition and good exposition and this was very necessary for this story but they're two very different films this one's more subdued but when the violence happens oh man does it happen and the way that it's filmed every single time it's just so shocking and we talked about the intense moments and there's one scene in particular and oh my gosh man edge of my seat we're already so far into the film it's already been the span of what two other movies combined would be and I'm still locked in I'm still focused because of the way score says he tells the story and it's also funny in the same way that Goodfellas was funny the unexpected humor there are some lines of dialogue and that are just hilarious from the smoke breaks that they have to take for their wives on their road trip to the way that Jimmy Hoffa gets frustrated because a guy shows up to a meeting in shorts and 15 minutes late it's just constantly throughout the movie you're sad you're intrigued you're a bit upset you're curious as to what is going to happen next and then you're laughing it's everything that you want in a theatrical experience now to the d aging there are some moments in here first sure where you're gonna look at it go I I don't know if that was perfect and yes it has to do more with the CGI but I think it's more of the fact that you are D aging the face of course but you're putting that face on the body now they're obviously going to the hands and stuff too but on the body of a person who is a bit older so even though they look younger when they start to walk they're a bit slouched and they walk like an older person and that's nothing against an arrow it's nothing against Pacino but you could just kind of tell every now and then that he's obviously not that young and I had trouble at moments trying to figure out what age he actually was but I do have to give kudos because the de-aging is so subtle at points that I didn't even notice it and after about 10 minutes of watching this with a really long runtime you don't care anymore because you're so locked into the story and you want him to keep going back throughout the years and tell more of his relationship with Russell of his relationship with Hoffa and De Niro is so captivating I mean obviously the best performances any of these guys have given in quite some time Ray Romano as well and I know I mentioned him before but I was just shocked at how subdued everyone was in this movie and then delivering on the jokes when they had to and a lot of people are going to ask since this reached the heights the level of what a Goodfellas did it's a very different film that movie focused on one thing this film focuses on morality and legacy and what did my life mean in the grand scheme of things and how do I handle the passing of time there are moments throughout the film where people start to not recognize those that have passed away a long time ago man and it makes you ask yourself these questions too it's like what does it all mean and all of this from another Scorsese my movie this film was epic I'm gonna encourage everybody to watch this seek it out in theaters but don't worry if you can't find it in theaters it's coming on Netflix like I said now it may be may be difficult because I feel like a lot of people are going to try to split this film up into like episodes because it's so long and I encourage you do not do that sit there locked in get some surround sound or whatever you need to do to get invested to get locked into these stories and I promise you it will be worth it and I hope it will captivate you I need to see the film again for sure because even though it flew by I do think it was a tad bit too long and like I said I did question some of the D aging effects otherwise I just I was so sucked into this film I have to go really high with my score if you guys enjoyed this video you liked this review hit that thumbs up button it helps out this video and this channel back to the score 196 percent for the Irishman my goodness what an
