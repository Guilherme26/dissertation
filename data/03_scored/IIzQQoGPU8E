alongside this orphan girl that he recently met (Paulette Goddard) because of two reasons: one,0.17187572
being the tramps usual bad luck and two being how work industries were changing possibly,0.29751065
for the worst at that time; businesses were replacing manual labor with machinery for the,0.1338098
sake of saving a profit and the machinery that did require manual labour had so,0.05089611
many advances that it became tough for labourers to handle the machinery in the first,0.06039278

I'm covering classical movies and I've always wanted to check out more silent movies anyways,0.060825396

on Netflix and it was my first and thankfully not last silent movie I'll ever,0.08959014
"see because ""Modern Times"" was such a huge surprise in so many ways-the biggest surprise",0.11385086
of course being with the with the physical comedy- with the slapstick! You hear it,0.30772242
all the time that Charlie Chaplin was a comedic genius in the silent era and,0.065166816
I was hesitant to think that way because I'm not really a big fan of,0.0616465
"labeling directors as 'geniuses' or 'hacks' but having seen this movie, Charlie Chaplin really was",0.12088518
a comedic genius because of how great he was at selling a laugh without any,0.15455174
words whatsoever! It didn't matter if the gags were forced or obvious or so predictable,0.10258368
"that you could see them coming a mile away, what really matters and what was",0.07018835
Chaplin's greatest skill was his comedic timing and delivery because he and the other actors,0.10277737
have these exaggerated facial expressions that tell you everything you need to know about these,0.22572689
people without any dialogue whatsoever but never to a point where it felt cartoony or,0.12368224
"unrealistic, if anything the stunts in this movie seen as plausible as you could possibly",0.13840559
get and that's because the gags and the reactions to the gags were (for the,0.054978665
"most part) done in one single take which made it feel real, made it feel",0.06499623
impressive and made us understand these characters as people while still laughing at them because,0.15074797
"that's something that slapstick comedies often don't really understand: these sight gags, the reactions-especially matters",0.24468994
so much to the characters and in many cases the reactions matter more than the,0.042639595
pratfalls because the Tramp has 2 recurring reactions that really sum him up as a,0.3047875
character; one is this dumbfounded look of confusion that happens for two reasons-one of which,0.34248808
is when he's in the wrong place in the wrong time and he's in he's,0.14955646
"an innocent person who doesn't understand what's going on and he suffers for it, or",0.26224533
the second one being when he has intentionally caused someone some problems and he just,0.13132875
"doesn't realize it, and the second expression is this very coy, guilty smile that says",0.08114556
"that he understands the trouble that he's in, that he didn't mean any harm to",0.09797221
anyone and that he's willing to make amends with these people as opposed to just,0.14985992
lashing out at each other and that's kind of the reason that makes the Little,0.10699309
"Tramp such a likeable character; he is gullible, he is naive, he does make a",0.5520385
lot of stupid decisions but he never means any ill will of anyone and if,0.86694825
"he realizes that he made any mistakes, he'll feel guilty about it-he'll want to help",0.10802658
anyone as quickly as possible and it's what leads him to making so many lasting,0.15768316
friendships in each of his movies. It's a character trope and it's a character personality,0.18416859
that I think any casual audience can really understand and relate to; we've all made,0.026702516
"dumb mistakes without the intention of hurting people and if we have, we feel guilty",0.66354835
"about it, we want to make amends and that's what really makes him such a",0.061804183
"realistic and likeable character, it makes it a lot easier to laugh for him and",0.101382695
at the people that he's causing trouble and mischief to and it also makes us,0.1488698
feel a little sad whenever the slapstick happens to him because we've latched on to,0.25263107
him as a character so much! But one of (for me) the best qualities about,0.14512557
this movie and something that I think gets overlooked about silent movies 'cause I don't,0.10193294
"hear people talk about this that much, the music! Chaplin was one of the few",0.0769052
directors who actually did the musical score for his own films there's been some complaints,0.08365541
"about the assistants he's worked with who some feel have contributed more to the music,",0.05504212
"but his primary assistant on ""Modern Times"" and I'm gonna try and get this guy's",0.339746

"writing a musical score; Chaplin knew how to play piano, violin and cello... what he",0.07896743
didn't know how to do was read or write sheet music so whenever Chaplin knew,0.14079481
what each scene sounded like in his own head he would improvise some notes on,0.24234188
a piano or he would humming out loud and Raskin would write down exactly what,0.19489747
he was humming and put it to sheet music so that they can get a,0.22489536
clearer idea of how to record the music and more importantly synchronize it to the,0.062482364
movie to each scene-to each pratfall because the music really does elevate the over-the-top expressions,0.15217076
that these characters give or the much more somber and sad moments in the movie,0.08683642
"a lot more depth & tension whenever there's a pratfall, the music makes it seem",0.20289218
so whimsical & cheerful because what we're watching is funny but with the dramatic scenes-especially,0.0858252
"with the song ""Smile"" which he wrote the music-he didn't write the lyrics, the lyrics",0.048536483
came around the Nat King Cole times when that song became popular but especially with,0.09712865

"Tramp, they have this abrupt romance but you still buy into it because they do",0.40333524
have a lot of things in common ;they have no one else in their lives,0.15931173
"to depend upon-no friends or family anymore, they make a lot of morally questionable choices",0.09603774
"for really no reason other than survival. They don't do it because they want to,",0.062013417
they do it because they feel as if they have to and in some cases...,0.06475267
"yeah, they probably did and they even do have some greedy moments-especially when they're crashing",0.20797026
"this department store and they're trying on these new shoes and sleeping in these beds,",0.05642114
I noticed very closely that most of the characters in this movie wear black on,0.19423918
the outside and white on the inside to symbolize that they're poor but at one,0.31089434
"point the orphaned girl puts on these white bedsheets and lies in this all-white bed,",0.50608265
"these silk cushions and these very furry blankets that symbolize their fantasies, their temptations that",0.27365372
they want for their own lives and then once they snap back into the black,0.65789706
"on the outside, white on the inside it's that difference between fantasy and reality that",0.28448308
makes it really hard to contribute colour symbolism to a black-and-white movie but Charlie Chaplin,0.16662672
really did find a way to make it work! Now as for problems I do,0.08237656
feel as if the orphaned girl (while she was still really good as an actress,0.17488354
and as a character) there are some things about her backstory that I thought were,0.07359218
"gonna have more involvement with in regards this story but after a while, after this",0.044602998
"really shitty occurrence happens in her life that changes everything for her, everything else that",0.8929414
matters to her- every other person that she's met they become practically non-existent and then,0.18526645
all she can think about is having a life with the Tramp (she has fantasies,0.3879363
that are exclusively him and none of these other people that are in a worse,0.35575235
situation that she can't depend upon) but I was under the impression that she would,0.0975925
"later come back to help them out but that wasn't the case, maybe she thought",0.09418638
"that it was too late for her to do something like that and if so,",0.08993013
I can completely understand that because the morals are about how the world is a,0.08021444
really unfortunate place and there are always going to be consequences whether you're innocent or,0.15116887

"modern actors... I'm not entirely sure if they can do just as well anymore, they",0.06976949
can obviously do well on their own but compared to actors who did it because,0.080275856

"this this genre of silent era might become popular again, who knows? So for all",0.058604565
