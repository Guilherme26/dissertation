now what I would call archetypal story from a slightly different perspective over and over,0.11597229
and over again after all when it comes to things that we as humans share,0.061897323
there is something incredibly unifying about the rite of passage that we experience when we,0.068812504
move from our parents house out into the big bad world from high school onto,0.15550207
the next chapter of our lives from childhood into adulthood and it's just kind of,0.122124344
fun to relive and just revisit an experience through cinema and so again just looking,0.05159725
at the narrative beats of book-smart we do indeed see director Olivia Wilde and screenwriters,0.15498158

newfound levels of maturity but what made all of these now classic moments work so,0.076066576
well and book-smart didn't just come from the screenwriters ability to craft them well on,0.1372093
the page it also came from a really wonderful group of actors when I think,0.1511335
back on my favorite films in this genre that has always absolutely been an essential,0.08728363
ingredient for them again films like American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused those films would,0.16021714
not have been half as memorable as they were without brilliant actors like Richard Dreyfuss,0.1110147
and Matthew McConaughey and can you even imagine the film like Ferris Bueller's Day Off,0.15077077
with an actor not quite as charismatic as Matthew Broderick and the same can absolutely,0.16206537
be said for something like Superbad as well and if you did find yourself liking,0.2232375
and laughing at and identify with either Michael Cera or Jonah Hill and that film,0.1503538
in book-smart you'll more than likely adore benny Feldstein who's actually Jonah Hill's little sister,0.40311894
and Katelyn Deaver speaking of the performances and yes I do realize that I do,0.06080723
find myself repeating the same sentiment every single time that I see a film from,0.08264679
an actor turned director but every single time that I do it's just so clear,0.081188425
that the person behind the camera the person in charge of guiding those performances has,0.0720711
so clearly been in an actor's shoes before and here it was indeed very clear,0.09921343
that Olivia Wilde in her new role was able to pull from so many of,0.15485482
her own experiences as an actress to help guide her performers in this film to,0.051253285
uniquely excellent places but it wasn't just that she got good performances out of them,0.12632176
I thought she also quite expertly threaded the very difficult stylistic and tonal needle coaching,0.10949433
out of her actors performances that in certain moments felt very authentic and very real,0.089051045
and another is appropriately heightened and just fun but now I actually saved my very,0.04749628
highest praise for this film for last looking at something like Superbad I really watched,0.10839469
that film and think wow what a phenomenally directed film what an impressive piece of,0.07832297
cinema where the director really showed a mastery over the medium ensuring that he was,0.0654484
using the camera the lighting the color and the music to always immerse me in,0.15018784
the film and to be fair I shouldn't just pick on Superbad either really when,0.052431878
it comes to all of the kind of Judd Apatow comedies very rarely did they,0.10849136
do anything that heightened in the directorial department they're rather cut and dry meat potatoes,0.1534487
they just rely on the comedy found in the script and in the actors performances,0.07941847
to really draw us in and keep us engaged throughout the film but not so,0.041504495
with book-smart and Olivia Wilde's direction this first-time feature film director was absolutely on fire,0.25124094
so clearly out to demonstrate her brilliance as a visual storyteller in this new position,0.18972497
and she did so and did so beautifully there were so many sequences in this,0.08018767
film that were appropriately as heightened and as fun and as colorful as a brilliant,0.08546795
music video just sucking me once more into the excitement and heightened importance of something,0.8392705
like the last day of school which is exactly how I as a high schooler,0.1125206
viewed such things just that much intention and creativity was fantastic to see in a,0.19268824
genre that so often overlooks it so even while book-smart didn't ultimately break that much,0.12253063
new ground from a narrative standpoint olivia wilde as a director was still able to,0.10064758
breathe so much fun fresh and engaging life into it with some excellent direction all,0.27393794
this to say i will definitely be keeping my eyes on this director as your,0.25885212
