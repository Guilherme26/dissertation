we so here we go with the positive so my pontiff's with the film our,0.046104543
first being I do think the acting for the most part is really good in,0.027002465
this movie Elsie Fisher is definitely I think the best element of this entire film,0.09067916
in my opinion I really do think she gives a really great performance as Kayla,0.05078145
she's fantastic she gives a lot of you know emotion and a lot of you,0.07074095
know a lot of quirks that you would see in you know a kid like,0.07804201
this around this time you know I mean because that's what I think I really,0.036734767
liked about this movie too is that it's kind of really relatable because I think,0.03733543
anybody can kind of relate to being like a shy kind of almost awkward teenager,0.061298
around this time and you know I will admit I was very much like that,0.04683159
hell I can still be like that sometimes to be honest just for you kind,0.2046085
of be a little bit awkward than just you know not knowing what to say,0.08205705
and stuff like that sometimes I found the labra relatability in that I think Elsie,0.036185324
Fisher Wooley bling brings that very well into this I do think she gives a,0.031022836
really great performance in this movie and you know definitely one of my favorites of,0.022424672
the year for sure she is fantastic in this and definitely probably my favorite element,0.018913167
of the entire film Josh Hamilton is also great in this movie he plays Kayla's,0.0172828
a father and he was great too like my favorite scene in this entire movie,0.02414018
is like a personal conversation between the two of them it's really fantastic like really,0.047666393
how Josh Hamilton you know kind of gives his performance in that team that's fantastic,0.03924251
I really loved you know um oh you know I'm kind of tried to be,0.034658063
the cool you know kind of quirky dad and you know Kayla's kind of not,0.056113563
like you know please stop but I actually like that you know I mean I,0.10772583
thought it made it well with each other I thought they actually had some good,0.02959003
chemistry with each other like I like their back and forth whenever they would interact,0.0755948
with each other like I thought Elsie Fisher and Josh Hamilton actually had some really,0.014896123
great chemistry with each other you know like whenever they had seamed together I was,0.10688836
actually really great to be honest because the two just had some great chemistry with,0.034787107
each other so yeah Josh Hamilton I thought was really fantastic in the movie and,0.08307279
I would say most of the rest of the acting is very good here -,0.06516139
you know the movie does have some really good acting here you know I do,0.025466556
think of the most part everyone does their job very well um no I like,0.023966568
this kind of just this character study of like like I said before this teenager,0.05373154
going through the last week of eighth grade you know going into high school cuz,0.053937748
you know and can kind of be a bit scary you know I mean because,0.061917953
it's high school you know big big deal whatever you know I mean so it,0.068001725
kind of puts a lot of pressure on Kayla and you do see that in,0.039187964
the film I do like that a lot and you know like I said gives,0.033804633
a lot of great length ability cuz I'm pretty sure everyone can kind of relate,0.029463645
to this and really can you feel this and I do think the movie does,0.022317577
a very good job of that I like how it presents itself with that in,0.03833786
the film I thought they did a very nice job of that in this movie,0.032387126
and yeah I thought they did a really good job with it on the soundtrack,0.047666393
is really good to hear I thought the soundtrack was also really good in this,0.017129809
movie I quite like the soundtrack a lot definitely some of the best use of,0.018569931
music I've seen all year to be honest like I really liked the soundtrack a,0.022610923
lot here um the humor now it's not like a straight up comedy or anything,0.079349756
but there is some humor that is implemented into this movie it's the most part,0.018422926
I do think it's really really good especially one scene in particular that I'm now,0.03340885
go okay I'll just say her dad walks into onto something it's pretty funny to,0.14688054
be honest like I was literally like dying of laughter like I wrote I loved,0.07771407
you if I was really funny so yeah there are some times where the movie,0.03467669
does use some humor in the film I thought was very well handled to be,0.018466828
honest the writing is really great to hear I do think the movie has a,0.028425293
really great screenplay in my opinion I did like the screenplay a lot with this,0.033374257
film the directing is really good here too it's very well shot the editing is,0.08059831
also really good as well and the cinematography is very good here too like I,0.025274983
do think the cinematography is actually really nice in this movie so yeah I would,0.036758713
say the directing overall is very good here and I will say for the most,0.035221472
part the pacing is pretty solid I do think for the most part it does,0.025386734
move and a nice solid pace you know so yeah I did think the movie,0.02285837
did move at a nice solid pace for the most part now there are some,0.015492127
negatives I do have with this film and the negatives are first being I do,0.014928051
think some of the acting can be a little bit stiff that points are some,0.042369537
points where I do think the acting can be a little bit stiff especially from,0.062525935
this one character that's supposed to be the L the typical mean girl and you,0.08778694
know I thought her acting was kind of a bit stiff and I can go,0.21655586
for some of the other people at times during this movie as well and yeah,0.051962152
really I thought just some of the acting like I said for the most part,0.018734897
really the acting is very good here in this movie but there are some points,0.028899569
where I did think he kind of got a little bit stiff some of the,0.084876105
humor doesn't really work for me I know there's this one scene that involves a,0.013583715
banana that everyone's talking about and really thinks it's hilarious to me I thought that,0.11384352
was just kind of and like I thought that was just kind of very like,0.014552223
poorly executed in my opinion I just didn't think it was all that done well,0.12585674
to be honest like there are some points where the humor just didn't work for,0.018480131
me I thought I was kind of like okay and lastly my biggest issue with,0.08375527
this movie is that some of the pacing when it gets slow it gets like,0.032439012
really really slow there are some points where kind of drags it out a bit,0.04190923
in my opinion Mike except for the most problems very invested into the movie I,0.042966872
thought the pacing was really good but there are some moments where the would the,0.022815134
pacing kind got a little bit slow and you know it can drag out a,0.13123143
little bit for me so yeah that's all I really got to say in terms,0.07409414
of negatives with this movie overall I would say eighth grade is a very good,0.07519901
movie in my opinion I did quite like the film a lot there are some,0.019592984
really good elements that I did really liked about this film a lot to be,0.027449468
honest um and overall I would honestly recommend it to everybody I do think it's,0.050174803
a very solid film and I did quite enjoy a lot so it's time for,0.038756926
my first grade on eighth grade and my first grade on eighth grade is a,0.040993936
b-plus like I said very good movie I quite liked it a lot maybe I,0.07108352
didn't love it as much as maybe some people did but I am glad the,0.026995149
idea to enjoy it overall there are some really good elements to this like I,0.030275833
said Elsie Fisher and Josh Hamilton gives some really great performances just the way it,0.013459991
kind of explores how a teenager feels during like you know going into high school,0.032321274
and stuff like that it was very good overall honestly I really liked this movie,0.046840902
a lot it's a very solid film of my opinion another really good coming-of-age movie,0.04726662
will be getting a lot of good ones likely to be honest and this is,0.015458203
another one of those examples so yeah I quite liked a lot definite deserves a,0.033971593
