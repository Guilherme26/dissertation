quite frankly I'm shocked that Avengers endgame is this good but then again I didn't,0.011764438
expect the Russo brothers to go Spielberg quite brilliant what do you think about it,0.07226755
and that not only they thought of going Spielberg in but they actually kind of,0.033551197
pulled it off it's not like it's not like a I wouldn't say it's a,0.051962815
ripoff of Spielberg but I'd say it's as much like Spielberg films as some of,0.07972159
the films that Robert Zemeckis has made and don't worry we're definitely going to talk,0.02767696
about back to the future welcome to my non-spoiler review of Avengers endgame and don't,0.024384968
worry I've gone through my notes for this review several times to make sure that,0.024585852
there is not a hint of a spoiler so it is safe to watch but,0.019221812
we are so much to talk about when I get to the spoiler review pretty,0.033731464
soon I but don't worry I'm gonna be very careful when I post that as,0.041992377
well all right so as I tweeted hours ago Avengers endgame you know I tweeted,0.024629755
this right after the press screening Avengers endgame truly is the greatest superhero movie of,0.017729806
all time and some of you were like you just got out of the movie,0.10240635
grace well it's been a few hours as I said and I still feel that,0.02901398
way now also some of you said you know your immediate reaction was also what,0.023911357
about insert superhero movie name here and my answer to that is those movies are,0.036230557
still great in fact Avengers endgame couldn't have happened without those movies because Avengers endgame,0.046006095
is truly the evolution of superhero filmmaking and someday I know it's gonna be hard,0.044603225
to believe after you see Avengers endgame but I guarantee you that someday and even,0.0245945
better superhero movie than this will come along but boy have the Russo brothers Kevin,0.041420322
Feige and the cast the cast is so good here across the board they have,0.030923722
set the bar very high and boy by the way speaking of the cast and,0.05622132
bringing it I cried so much during this movie like for the first two-thirds I,0.07466487
was like so far so good haven't shed any tears you know I can take,0.061435696
it it's not it's not that sad cuz you know people going into this for,0.052290753
like oh I know I'm gonna cry a whole lot but I was like oh,0.04620831
that's just the hardcore Marvel fans I'll be fine third act BAM I was bawling,0.069218345
tears of joy and sadness but like I cried all my makeup it was crazy,0.09162905
it was rude and I even actually kind of teared up a little bit after,0.143526
the movie thinking about it someone also tears of joy and sadness there as well,0.031841677
now I would say the biggest inspirations for avengers endgame movie wise are the following,0.025194496
the first Avengers the magic of that film which perfectly captured not only what a,0.03118647
team-up movie can be but what it's like to read a comic book I often,0.070473544
particularly in the third act felt like I was looking at comic book panels even,0.03984317
actually throughout the movie we very much had that feeling Logan and what it's like,0.015505431
to draw upon years that fans and actors have spent with characters and then back,0.012703678
to the future Wow reference several times in this very movie Avengers end game is,0.026999138
as good not better than back to the future when it comes to time-traveling storytelling,0.038228106
by the way those of you re watching all the MCU movies to prepare for,0.027445477
this one you are not wasting your time I didn't watch them though but I,0.059819967
you know I still was able to enjoy this movie because I did recall a,0.02530425
lot of the things they were referencing it still was really full of really great,0.022863692
surprises an Avengers end game on that notice I said has strong hints of Spielberg,0.057131957
just as the mecha has worked in in that trilogy really strong hints of Spielberg,0.020496303
when I think about it I think that's why it works so well Spielberg has,0.01812825
that that lightness that magic that sense of drama theme a little bit of a,0.047814067
theme park you feel to it that's the best way to describe Avengers and geib,0.12438469
Spielberg in now speaking back to the future don't worry this isn't a spoiler I'm,0.023201605
just trying to describe a sensation so now remember at the end of part 2,0.016720721
when Marty learns that doc has been transported back to 1885 has been and has,0.022925554
been living there right that was an amazing moment in cinematic history Doug again as,0.016738681
I said to worry this is not a spoiler and audiences when they saw that,0.024912458
had to wait an entire year to see what happened next well here you don't,0.01894975
have to wait they play that second movie it's almost as if adventures end game,0.026109789
is two films but two films that fit together it's a joy instead of like,0.019259727
oh you cheated instead you're like thank you for letting me watch it now now,0.07303051
remember also speaking of other films when I said that I was watching The Incredibles,0.042655565
- I felt bad that I you know the sense of dread came about you,0.09225299
know towards the end knowing that it would end well Avengers endgame again on that,0.033041667
note did not really end right I got so much story so much wish fulfillment,0.03134678
but yeah at the same time so many surprises and all ton by the way,0.02017103
in a very masterful way don't worry I'm gonna give the screenwriters their own shout,0.06549398
out a little later on in this review but when the movie finally did end,0.06524387
with plenty of teases for phase 4 by the way there are no end credits,0.026357237
scenes but it doesn't really need them again they do a lot to set up,0.03179112
what's gonna happen going forward but I not only felt sad is fine but I,0.026889384
have complete faith in the MCU going forward I mean I'm sure they'll make a,0.024152152
couple of mistakes here and there but overall I feel Kevin Feige is as seasoned,0.038661804
as the Avengers themselves now something I was not prepared for going into this movie,0.026074534
was how strong the representation is when it comes to women oh man we talk,0.056074318
so much about representation these days and I guess you know we have had a,0.0117438175
lot of talk about representation for women but this stuff felt really good I mean,0.07995308
that also brought a tear to my eye several times and while I criticized Avengers,0.04946106
infinity war for fridge and Gamora which they totally did Avengers endgame does right by,0.08639738
so many female characters so many of them if you like any female character in,0.058508225
the MCU I think you're gonna be pretty happy at the end of this movie,0.050844643
and there's also a third act surprise that took my breath away I'm not kidding,0.025604248
I gasped in the theater I was like are you gonna do this and they,0.15881127
did several times actually with female characters come to think of it and the women,0.06639331
and Avengers are simply that they're Avengers fellow warriors with as much on the line,0.0412507
and just as committed and just as at risk no Mary Sue's here as their,0.019953514
male counterparts and I could not be happier now speaking of representation while the door,0.14325461
is closed on Stuckey alas a window has been opened with Captain Marvel just opened,0.048438672
a smidge mind you but distinctly opened not overtly opened there's just a slight rainbow,0.06671127
breeze but I think it's definitely there I think brie Larson has made some strong,0.026785616
choices here particular you'll note well I don't want to give anything away and I,0.032770272
like to realize some alot here by the way she is a team player but,0.019022921
still a big gun she had some really cool moments and I think taking her,0.25385812
character in this direction works with her performance here and the other choices that Larson,0.0232189
has not only made on camera but I would say off camera as well I,0.042501245
think this is gonna work out real well for her now every single character here,0.043272194
gets a chance to shine thanks to a very strong script by Christopher Markus Stephen,0.011767099
McFeely and in addition to character moments and development this movie has it all there,0.016886352
are also some very clever story elements as well and I was very impressed with,0.013887039
where I was like oh really I didn't even see that coming that's so smart,0.035573356
there's also real danger which I appreciated that something I feel has been missing from,0.03321528
a lot of Marvel movies again I gasped several times from concern I actually I,0.059100904
was on the edge of my seat for a lot of the movie but I,0.0317113
actually was biting my lip for part of it I was like oh no oh,0.09427581
my god it was great I loved that stuff and there are also real consequences,0.04238151
and Markus and McFeely feely are asked to do so much with the script and,0.02368586
they do it all and they do it organically very very impressive now as for,0.023149721
my favorite characters it's tough to do without spoilers but I'm gonna give you a,0.033344325
quick list here again without spoilers Chris Hemsworth just when you think there's nowhere else,0.02772685
he can take Thor he he blows us away again he's got that thor ragnarok,0.09517647
magic and momentum going hardcore oh so good my dad is a particular Chris Hemsworth,0.044938475
fan I know he's gonna be thrilled when he sees this movie Scarlett Johansson I,0.04310523
can't talk about it Wow Paul rah I mean I know that was very loud,0.026506238
if you're listening to this on headphones but that's the best way I can communicate,0.047744885
how amazing so the Scarlett Johansson stuff is here Paul Rudd and Mark Ruffalo Mark,0.09515385
Ruffalo Wow Wow the stuff with the Hulk Wow but they also really do a,0.023448389
lot to bring some some humor and balance it out you know with the with,0.02943371
the with the seriousness of the movie both of them are incredibly funny Karen Gillan,0.13128597
Wow nebula has quite the meaty storyline and is involved in some of the really,0.03424565
clever plot points like again Wow as for Robert Downey jr. and Chris Evans I,0.020786325
can't give really anything away here so it's hard to talk about them but let,0.036087543
me just say perfectly poetic Wow again Wow Spielberg Ian and Wow that's those are,0.02854037
the terms for Avengers end game now finally I'd also like to add there were,0.043771744
many times watching this movie that I wished I could hit pause or rewind to,0.09971303
take it all in to see my favorite characters charging into battle in detail I'm,0.0349401
like if this was a comic book panel I could take a moment and look,0.08834703
at each character and be like oh they look so cool and that's totally how,0.017122492
they would fly or go into battle so here I'm looking forward to seeing it,0.03498866
again I have my tickets on Saturday but I you know even that won't be,0.026597368
enough I really want to get my hands on this and pause certain frames and,0.070730306
then also there were amazing moments that I wanted to see again immediately because I,0.02993659
just couldn't believe my eyes and in some cases my good luck that it was,0.025782518
actually happening I was like wow again wow I think the rewatch ability of this,0.043912098
movie is off the charts as I said I have my tickets for Saturday I'll,0.035769586
definitely be watching again with again with you guys and watch along when it comes,0.014562201
out on streaming but I couldn't even see myself seeing it a third time it,0.09417337
has instant classic scene after instant classic scene and the scenes also mean something which,0.02851975
is just incredible I don't think avengers endgame is going to win any Oscars outside,0.02705701
of maybe VFX maybe you know some of you were asking me all is this,0.055556804
Best Picture material but you know what Back to the Future didn't really win any,0.015432261
Oscars either just for sound editing but that doesn't mean that avengers endgame is not,0.01046866
a truly special film and it highlights how unique it is what Feige has built,0.03234788
with the MCU over ten years but not only its uniqueness the fighting art not,0.023803597
only recognizes the strength of what he's built but has the ability to actually do,0.022563694
something with that to spend that capital it's just amazing it just shows you know,0.023693176
that AMC was running a marathon not a sprint and what a juggernaut they have,0.076807424
truly become and I always say that they are a juggernaut with strong business decisions,0.06849263
but I hear I feel here they're creative decisions match the strength of their business,0.016532475
decisions and when you have strong creative and business decisions you're pretty much unstoppable which,0.044829387
is where I think the MCU is right now and on that note I think,0.03267249
that this movie is a worthy challenger to Jane Camryn's films at the top of,0.04876927
the box office the all-time box-office and I think Avengers endgame deserves the honor of,0.034577575
being the highest-grossing film of all time and I truly hope that it breaks into,0.0346268
the three billion dollar club I think it's worth that and that's how it would,0.044858653
stand out instead of an Oscar totally deserving I suggest seeing the film in 2d,0.051573683
that's how the press screening was they didn't even let us see it on a,0.01750963
big screen it was like a tiny little screen in 2d and I still love,0.08663751
the thing just make sure you see it see it as soon as possible to,0.020419808
avoid spoilers because I also tweeted it's an impossible movie not to talk about because,0.035592645
it's just so exciting so someone might give you a spoiler but they can't help,0.036951616
themselves so as I said if you come up to someone who is or a,0.12926115
couple or run into someone online who has seen Avengers endgame just politely excuse yourself,0.094550535
do yourselves both a favor don't let them ruin the film for you and don't,0.091908425
put that on them because they don't feel bad but they get up themselves again,0.057070095
and so oh by the way oh so there are no good bathroom breaks that,0.041502137
you're just sorry you're out of luck every look every inch and every minute of,0.10216688
the movie is important you can't miss it I'm sorry so who took just make,0.02072313
sure you don't have to go to the bathroom during this movie so good luck,0.037365362
avoiding spoilers and I'll see you back here very soon for the spoiler review until,0.095366046
then leave your thoughts down below no spoilers I will be trying to monitor the,0.04431786
comments as best as I can and deleting spoilers don't do it and if I,0.0672341
see you putting spoilers I will block you as well so but enjoy a spoiler,0.35583404
