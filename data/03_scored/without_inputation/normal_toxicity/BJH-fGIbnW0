hi everyone and welcome back to roll the credit my name is Hana,0.05547499
and this is a channel for everyone,0.06459279
who's interested in film TV and pop culture today we are gonna be talking about a play that is currently running at the null coward theater in London,0.5154597
and it is all about Eve starring Julie Madison,0.037161373
and Lily James in the main roles,0.081756815
I saw this performance about two weeks ago now for my birthday and I was actually quite surprised how good it was,0.060188826
and I'm someone who doesn't really go to the theater a lot but I love love love Gillian Anderson,0.15001073
so it was a guaranteed success for me,0.05919169
and I'm just really happy that it didn't disappoint me because sometimes when you have a favorite actress or after a director and you watch something that's a little bit different to what you've seen them in before,0.10619302
sometimes you do end up getting a little bit disappointed but Gillian Anderson is a master at theater,0.13175659
she is absolutely stunning when she's on stage and doing her thing,0.26951784
I have previously seen her in streetcar named desire but I saw their like national theater and live performance and not actually saw it in the theater,0.06124446
and she is amazing,0.076129995
so we're gonna talk a little bit about Gillian understood and her amazingness and also discussing obviously the entire play and the ensemble and just the scenography and everything about All About Eve,0.104145944
before I get going to that if you do enjoy this video and you want to see more of my reviews and live reactions to watching TV series of films for the first time then make sure that you hit the subscribe button down below and if you do enjoy this video make sure you give it a thumbs up,0.115188636
so yeah let's get into discussing all of my Eve,0.08560058
so I can't wait into this play and performance only knowing that it was about this woman and her understudy that was all I knew and that is pretty much,0.18734989
what the play is about,0.055454824
so it is called All About Eve,0.038179465
and Eve is played by Lily James and she he comes into the life of Margo,0.075448096
I can't remember her last name Margo Channing she comes into life on Margo Channing who is a Broadway star and a sensation,0.1501999
she comes in to her life after one of her performances Eve has been standing at the stage door and has been to every single performance that Margo has done and she starts telling her the story about her life on how she aspires to be Margo and it just it kind of takes on from there,0.09288296
Margaret kind of takes eat under her wing and lets her come into her home,0.32206014
she stays in her house and comes to the theatre with her to work there and eventually she becomes Margo's understudy,0.12984155
so in the beginning you kind of just feel that okay,0.094932206
Eve is a huge fan of Margo,0.09931714
and she just aspires to be a good as good of an actress that Margo is the further along in the play get the weirder it starts getting,0.08221628
Michael has a boyfriend who is a lot younger than her and Margo is actually in her like prime years so she is getting a little bit too old or she feels that she's getting too old in her world or in her like in her career and uh seeing Eve coming up and kind of flirting with her boyfriend,0.24281727
she does get a very very insecure,0.37275004
and when her boyfriend comes back from a gasps la they throw a big birthday slash welcome home party for him,0.24163993
and it's just a very odd situation because they have all these friends and family over,0.0599152
but Margo just doesn't really spend time with him,0.08559711
she gets meeting any junk and she doesn't like the life that has become of her since Eve entered her life,0.6364068
and I think that is pretty much the main trigger for her look since Eve came in and started becoming like more and more attached to her and starting to take a bigger role in her life or in the lives of the people around Margo she starts feeling very very insecure,0.15244496
and eventually just spirals and she doesn't really trust anyone and she sees how Eve just takes and takes and takes more of what is Margo's life and she starts to and doubt the people around her and also doubt herself in who she is,0.09679048
now I'm terrible,0.20849845
I remember things that happened while I watched them so that is pretty much,0.06494724
the like rundown of the story all about each is based on the film that was all about Eve back in the day I think it's like from the 60s we're gonna read a little quickly from Wikipedia,0.06903576
yeah so let you it is pretty much,0.075911514
what I said Margo Channing is a highly regarded but aging Broadway star,0.0765154
and Eve Harrington is an ambitious young fan who insinuates herself into Channing's life ultimately threatening Chinese career and her personal relationship and I just felt that I don't want to give anything away from people who haven't like watched the previous film or read the script or anything like I don't want to spoil the ending,0.12109868
but such a good ending I just thought it was like the perfect theater ending,0.18570472
in a way because I don't really like with theater ends and like a happy like a happy ending you usually doesn't it is usually like it leaves you sat there and received with something to think about and this play definitely definitely definitely leaves you tons to think about before I get into my praise,0.14930576
for,0.028156295
Gillian Anderson I just want to talk about the scenography and the production design of this because it was a little bit different from any other theatre performance I've ever seen,0.10487737
I think the only other play or like adoption of a play I've ever seen I was very different was 1984 that I saw in Cardiff once and I just having read the book and seen the film seeing it on stage was just such a contrast,0.029834768
and it was a very minimalistic performance in that way and and all about II was very interestingly like placed so so the stage looks pretty much like a room we open up and it's an empty room,0.09208473
it's got three walls,0.07561842
so obviously we are the fourth wall as always and eventually once the first opening like monologue is finished,0.08931362
all the walls come up and we get to see there's a door at the end and on the Left,0.08331803
there's something that looks like,0.06121985
and there's a door there too and then there's a door on the right side the walls hug dog come up now become video screens which I thought was very very interesting and it took me a little while to understand what was happening because I was very confused,0.086398944
essentially the video screams allows the audience to see what is happening in other parts of the play,0.09132093
the main stage is either her dressing room or her apartment and by her,0.12358384
I mean Margo's in the back is the bathroom and on the left is a kitchen slash like entryway,0.30969006
so during the big party when her boyfriend comes home there's a lot of action going on in the kitchen,0.16248553
so everyone's hanging out in the kitchen drinking while all the action is happening on the main stage,0.26631123
but then there's also action happening in the bathroom,0.07423002
there's a scene that I completely missed which are very excited to see when I go back to watching it for closing night,0.07590127
but literally the entire cast is on the main stage,0.07341887
and for some reason everyone was laughing,0.10895598
I couldn't figure out what everyone was laughing,0.09458124
but in on the big screen we see Margo in the bathtub,0.09938591
she is wasted out of her mind and on the big screens they show Margo in the back in the bathroom like falling into the bathtub doctors added another dimension to what is usually seen in a theater,0.15528037
and I just thought that was quite a clever way of allowing the stage to be extended in that way and also incorporating a little bit more video,0.15195477
they also used it in a fantastic way by by putting a camera in the mirror that she has in her dressing room,0.22874421
so when she's like looking at herself and being like oh my god I'm old blown up on a big screen on the stage,0.15473478
and we get to see like up close and personal with her and then just like it adds a little bit more dimension to a stage play,0.1298181
and I thought that was quite clever,0.11059277
yeah I thought that was quite a clever way and a nice touch as someone who very very very infrequently visits the theatre,0.15358375
I also liked this set design and how it was all one color so the bed and the sofa and carpet and the walls,0.2595957
they were all the same shade of like a dark pinkish burning me color,0.30553174
I just like when it's simplistic,0.08509022
I like when they don't try to add too much and like just lets the story tell itself but I also liked how it opened up to everything that was backstage that that also like the backstage area was a character of itself,0.069364056
and that just really interests me a lot if we go into the acting it was just like an all-around stellar cast,0.09198522
I don't think that anyone really disappointed me I am gonna talk a little bit ma'am,0.15090935
I am gonna talk a little bit about Lilly James I'm probably not her biggest fan,0.13533093
and I haven't really seen her in a bunch,0.10745395
I'm literally just seen her in Mamma Mia I wasn't the biggest fan of her performance in this show I just felt that she was kind of bland but it could just be that her character's not very interesting,0.23484203
even though the play is called All About Eve,0.03576009
it's literally all about Margo,0.09477928
and I don't know maybe that is like if without giving away,0.10598032
the ending,0.09388477
maybe Margo was the same person Eve,0.0675306
was what she was young and she went to the theater,0.09148536
and she saw this big star,0.17310543
and then she became her understudy and kind of took over her life I don't know maybe that is what that is,0.13556755
maybe why it's called All About Eve,0.041248355
but it's literally not All About Eve,0.052660674
and I'm quite happy that Margo has the biggest role and that Julie Anderson actually gets to like thrive in her role as Margo Channing because it's just like it's such a stunning role,0.09757427
and Gillian Anderson is as I said amazing in this role and I'm so happy that she took on this task I am very excited to go back to the null character and see it on closing night because it is possibly,0.17378306
one of the best plays I've ever seen,0.064226195
and I haven't seen a lot and it isn't just because Jillian Addison's fantastic in it the entire cast is fantastic writing is very witty,0.070242874
and I loved the stage setup even though in the beginning I was very confused and kind of didn't like it,0.05112687
it was fantastic,0.09903128
now that I think about a little bit more Eva Von Hoff just like did a really good job in directing the ensemble like everyone had something to do with all times and the people in the back while things were happening mainstage the people are in the kitchen,0.15139225
they were going full out,0.07093142
and it was really very impressive just to see like it created the life of a party even though the party was in the back room and on the main room the party wasn't really there it just added so much dimension to the play,0.065249614
I also kind of joy when they do break the fourth wall and they do break,0.12118594
the fourth wall quite a couple of times in this play there is a lot of talking to the audience,0.06495623
but it's more like the audience of the theater that they're doing,0.034732204
I can't remember which character or what significance her KarenT has I think she's like Margo's manager or something like that,0.12920895
and or the producer she talks directly to the audience kind of updating us on what's going on and what's happening,0.07146735
it kind of like Annie's way in in a sense and I did quite enjoy that I do enjoy when they break the fourth wall and through that making the audience feel like they are the audience like they're just spectators they're not part of the play they're just spectators and but still being able to address the audience in that way if that makes any sense I don't even know I said but I think that made sense anyway yeah Judy Madsen is fantastic,0.08403834
she was just nominated for an over here all olivia.olivia award I can say that,0.098861225
so I'm very excited to see that all of you your oliviere awards I'm definitely not a theater person as you can tell so I'm very excited to see that,0.35175666
and I have my fingers crossed for Jillian Addison because she is stunning and as much as I love everything that she does I want her to do more theater stuff and also more comedies,0.27411786
so imagine her doing a comedy play that would just be amazing,0.14905645
so that is my review and my thoughts about Oliver Eve that you can catch at the mill coward theater right here in London so make sure you go see that I think it ends on the 11th of May I could not be more excited to see it again,0.45936924
because it is stunning and every seat in the house is amazing even the cheap seats up at the top where I was representing go see All About Eve,0.07465466
if you do have a time to come to London,0.12200162
otherwise make sure you catch it on the National Theatre live performance that is on the April the 13th,0.07167463
I believe anyway that is all for this review I hope you liked it,0.08228457
and I hope I didn't just random up,0.083978504
I think I made sense,0.067793414
I hope I made sense,0.109367214

if I did make sense or not I'm sorry if I didn't but I just really liked All About Eve,0.05501409
