welcome back to my channel today on my channel,0.11329672
I'll be reviewing a quiet place a quiet place is a 2018 American horror film directed by John Krasinski from a screenplay by Brian Wood Scott Beck and Krasinski based on a story by Woods and Bek the film follows a family who must live their life in silence while hiding from creatures which hunt exclusively by sound despite all the film's praise I tried my best to keep my expectations low this was mostly because I was fearing it turning into another don't breathe scenario where everyone loves it,0.035874594
so hard that I'm expecting something amazing,0.11425366
and then when I finally get to watch it I end up hating it with a fiery passion that being said there were many things I enjoy about this film though ultimately I was not nearly as enamored by it as much as the public seemed to be from the moment the film began I found its filming choices quite for hitting,0.09929201
I knew I was going into a film that moreso the time was going to lack sound but even though I knew this I wasn't expecting the extent in many films even when there is an absence of dialogue,0.07233963
there is still background noise or even a score to keep the audience engaged when this film begins there is nothing it is,0.06189772
so quiet,0.06926055
I honestly felt something was wrong with the copy I was watching but everything was just fine,0.10110539
it was impressive to see how far in they were willing to go and how far they would take the concept the slightest noise even so much as a pin dropping means death and for that reason they take every precaution to avoid any and all sound watching this inaction was deafening it was a shock to my senses and made me very uncomfortable which meant it was doing its job,0.119311124
and for that reason I was hooked when the film surprises you with the burst of sound you feel the level of alarm and panic and induces and it is perfectly acted out in our performers faces that instant feel where your mind races with all the ways this moment could turn out but the most important being will you survive,0.099551186
I felt these moments,0.118155986
were inserted very smartly and sporadically they weren't one after another which would have been overkill and not fit the tone of the film the cinematography,0.17878966
I found was quite simple,0.07688002
but in this case simple works perfect for what maybe is you're already doing something incredible when it comes to sound you're so strongly focused on how to utilize one sense that I think if they had amped up the visuals it would have just become a sensory Emily Blunt for me is the standout performer of this film while I felt,0.12183832
everyone did a phenomenal job,0.089607865
she of course took it to a whole other level,0.09245848
there is a lot of range to her character fear pain determined protective loving and seeing her act out each of these things was just incredible,0.04093145
I was truly blown away by what she brought to this film as for Millicent Simmons while her breakthrough role was in 2017,0.11086084
so wonderstruck her role in this film and what this film represents when it comes to the hearing,0.18043748
impaired community is a breakthrough all in itself,0.31089434
it's really great to see minority Act as being given more roles,0.06182526
and what I liked in this film is that usually when you see an actor with an impairment on screen the character is very obviously part of the minority,0.057000123
and they stand out from everyone else and are almost depicted as abnormal but amidst despite her condition she's not depicted as abnormal at all due to the circumstances she's very much like everyone else while she can't hear and doesn't speak,0.12097899
she's not made to feel different because no one else is able to speak,0.18803014
and therefore there is nothing to hear,0.0631066
most of the time I found that quite interesting to witness I was surprised by how many people were killed in this movie I honestly wasn't expecting everyone to die,0.40323246
I was thinking it would be one of those movies where it's all about the suspense and the anticipation of death but no actual death,0.24894418
so when it happens I was quite stunned and again impressed however I was not impressed with the creatures themselves and I did feel we were exposed to them true soon and that took away a lot of the suspense for me,0.06634985
I felt their appearance was true over the top for a film with such a simple style,0.103025444
the final confrontation with them,0.1017781
did remind me a fair bit of signs you think everyone screwed but in the last second they figure out the one thing that can kill them that,0.74482197
no one was able to figure out their appearance,0.1449305
I was expecting something I'd never seen before that these creatures honestly look like a venom and the truth fairies from Hellboy had a baby,0.37289137
so because it felt reminiscent of another,0.050881088
I wasn't very impressed by them there was some what I would consider convenient plot points that were inserted into the film,0.15304202
and I personally find it aggravating when anything is done for the sake of convenience especially in a horror movie it just lowers the quality for me because it feels lazy,0.21390203
for example the scene with the nail,0.07454556
I felt was unnecessary,0.105328634
we already have the character going into labor and trying to be quiet about it which is next to impossible,0.15084682
and this was Blunt standout moment of the film for me,0.049537156
I imagine that's much like what Scientology is like point,0.08925424
is this moment was stressful enough and I'm sure could have still led to making noise,0.11379866
so the addition of the nail bit,0.102408364
I was unimpressed with the silo scene I felt again added an unnecessary moment to the film the entire circumstances of the film are intense and dangerous enough,0.13788858
so inserting this scene that was about how can we up the danger factor,0.15384577
again,0.048684232
I felt was pushing it my other issue was found in the final scene when they realized the creatures weakness and they use it to fight back this I also found a bit convenient,0.10460571
I'm not sure how all the scribbles on the walls,0.23369098
and the newspaper articles everywhere allowed her to piece together what their weakness was and how she could utilize it,0.103736125
she did seem to figure that out abnormally fast and piece it together in a way I just don't understand so while the logic of what their weakness is I think is perfect and makes total sense how they discovered,0.0955454
it in that moment,0.057699885
I didn't find believable I'm also trying to piece together where the creatures come from from the newspaper clippings I assume they appeared from a meteor or asteroid that was mentioned,0.10316522
but I'm not sure if so that would again make them aliens and would once again,0.16159438
remind me of science overall there was a lot that I was impressed with,0.074531466
and I am certainly blown away with how this film uses sound and the absence of sound to create a story and how they depicted it was incredible,0.07413295
and as I mentioned the performances were stellar but there are still things about this film I was not impressed with it being a horror film I never felt scared or even really felt that suspenseful and when moments reminded me of other films what little suspense,0.091432154
I was feeling was instantly diminished,0.15073213
so these elements had zero impact on me,0.15904543
I honestly only jumped once and it was because the dad popped up out of nowhere prior to seeing it,0.17891133
I felt a sequel was ridiculous having now seen it,0.5295279
I do see how the ending lends itself to a sequel but I personally don't feel it needs one after the success of this,0.14973377
I don't believe a sequel will match what this has done and will just end up as another staple,0.16331376
that is there to make money but contributes absolutely nothing ultimately still a solid film,0.0973051
thank you,0.039406788
so much for watching this video,0.114006065
