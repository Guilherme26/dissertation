Pixar itself must be a bundle of emotions as the animation studio tries to reclaim its former glory,0.10305225
you're watching beyond the trailers review of inside out,0.16421373
I'm joy,
this is sadness,0.07526646
that's anger,0.14018686
yeah this is disgust and that's fear we're Riley's emotions these are rice memories they're mostly happy you'll notice not drag,0.23756924
I wanted to maybe hold more what happened sadness,0.07626952
she did something to the memory is everything,0.10112878
okay,0.050967906
Thank You Pat Joey great joy no the core memories,0.060953967
can I say that curse word,0.49793342
now yes,0.051385034
ironically the studio which claimed it would never make a sequel got sidetracked by them,0.1240752
in fact Pixar has a dicey history with sequels as it was the threat of making Toy Story 2 without them that force then-fledgling animation studio to stay in business with Disney,0.13913114
even though the two companies weren't getting along eventually in 2006 Disney fully acquired Pixar,0.04881382
and even though Pixar insisted it was still semi-autonomous,0.0741507
it became sequel centric after the acquisition Toy Story 3 Cars 2 monsters University and coming soon finding dory Toy Story 4 and The Incredibles 2 the box office numbers for these sequels are pretty impressive with Toy Story 3 Pixar's most successful film ever but their new focus on sequels has cost Pixar some of its prestige allowing,0.07897359
its step-sibling Disney Animation to make some big moves frozen,0.112475894
in big hero 6 not only dominated at the box office,0.15296398
but also won the last two Best Animated Feature Oscars,0.051124927
in fact frozen surpassed Toy Story 3 to become the most successful animated film of all time,0.08021151
but while Pixar set out 2014 Disney Animation is sitting out 2015 giving Pixar just the opening they need they're releasing two original films this year the good dinosaur for Thanksgiving,0.08615324
and this summer inside out and true Pixar fashion inside out is an ambitious project that hopes to be both intellectual and mainstream ironically calling to mind,0.11485841
some of the classic animated shorts from friendly competitor Disney Animation on how the mind and body work and let's not forget that the sitcom Herman's head already laid the groundwork for this idea as well speaking of television inside add is a little light on star power for a Pixar film going with mostly TV,0.05904482
talent,0.05425793
there's former Saturday Night Live performers Amy Poehler and Bill Hader the offices Phyllis Smith and Mindy Kaling now over on Hulu with the Mindy project books Comedy Central's Lewis Black and alas who would seem that even here sequel itis is at work as Pixar already has a short plan for the blu-ray release of inside out entitled Riley's first date,0.020386476
but everyone might be able to relate to being highly emotional,0.028669635
well these personified versions of emotions ironically keep us for making an emotional connection with Riley herself so inside out is an interesting case,0.13815492
because while I think it succeeds wildly as an introduction to psychology 101,0.0925162
I think it fails miserably as a film now this is my non-spoiler review,0.31089434
my spoiler review will also go up today,0.05902276
so I'm going to try and explain what I mean by that without giving anything away about the film and I guess the crux of my argument is that this is a message first an entertainment second and with filmmaking,0.060559656
it's supposed to do the other way around basically inside-out swaps it's a and B storylines but even worse than that I mean that implies still some kind of structure and inside out is is out of control creatively as the emotions in Riley's head and logic isn't just missing from the filmmaking process here but from the movie itself literally yes,0.08439082
while I was watching inside out,0.108927794
I was like something's missing here this isn't a complete picture of the human mind,0.12501289
I just I couldn't put my finger on it,0.24233174
I was like this is not a complete picture,0.076607786
so I thought about and I thought about it,0.055393577
and I just couldn't crack it,0.11311046
so I was googling emotions I was like what are they give me the list of emotions because I know that someone's absent and lo and behold,0.17707925
I found an article talking about inside out,0.09844372
and how they had originally intended to have a sixth emotion in Riley's head and that would be logic,0.07968724
and I was like Eureka,0.053890437
it was a really bad idea to cut logic out of this movie because emotions are governed by logic,0.10905773
and I think the logic could have represented Riley,0.04793568
heck more than represented her,0.44256103
I think it should have been Riley inside her own head,0.50806886
you know the voice in our head,0.23544788
when we're kind of like when we talk to ourselves we're thinking things through because Riley was really absent from her own persona which made it very difficult difficult to not only emotionally connect with the character,0.054675527
but the film itself there just was this detachment,0.06487332
and I think it's like you know the really popular idea of an angel and a devil on your shoulder right which is I guess kind of like the origin of this idea this idea evolved from that,0.3036091
but the fun thing about the angel and the devil on your shoulders is that you talk to them they talk to you there's a dialogue,0.4122654
you are wrestling with your emotions,0.23288071
as I said logic governs emotions,0.079253346
but here the angel and the devil are talking amongst themselves and you are just left out,0.3533746
and I think that ultimately doesn't ring true as representative of who we are I mean we all we all are emotional,0.07681968
but we are that's not all,0.0542941
we are right,0.03191957
there there's like a I guess a soul missing like emotions are reactionary,0.07653681
what was where is the driving force of Riley that wasn't in the film and when we're not we're not all Yeager's controlled by an argumentative,0.076501265
team of five desperately in need of a team-building exercise,0.14949918
now that said uh what I think is the fatal flaw of the film I still did enjoy a number of elements in the movie for instance I'm again,0.07957499
no spoilers here,0.08766107
but I really liked the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film they were brilliant,0.06522189
and I was very happy,0.060823485
I was like who looks like I'm gonna like this film after all and then it just totally fell apart I'd say when joy and sadness start their little road trip again,0.08903645
I don't want to give anything away,0.104729705
that's when the movie starts to go off the rails,0.110234626
but the beginning of the film is excellent Pixar at its best,0.05273585
and I think when you start watching this movie if you haven't already you'll be like that grace is crazy this movie's great and then you'll be like oh yeah it is it is kind of boring more on that in a moment,0.40324634
now I also really liked the world-building which I think does good a job as possible when trying to depict such a complex and difficult and abstract subject as the human mind,0.11018217
I also like the world-building of San Francisco but that was very well done,0.08887859
- I thought it was very well,0.056310266
realized so I liked that I also liked the animation you know we talked recently about the good dinosaur and how the animation looks really wonky there with the,0.15258834
dinosaurs but here this was classic Pixar everything was beautifully realized in the mind and in the real world but the best of all was by far and,0.21142866
away,0.17579179
joy joy is offense pastic,0.10959986
character i love how she,0.06884618
glows I love little pixelation of her skin and Amy Poehler to such a wonderful and nuanced job providing her,0.26170778
voice and I also thought the expressiveness of joy was really good,0.0796819
it was just it was the full package that character more than anybody,0.06987527
else in the movie just really came together,0.06448884
I was like that's a winner,0.061046064
and then I also like Riley even though I think that Riley because I want to get to know her better but what was very odd about Riley,0.079380065
and this occurred to me after I watched the film was that really is like not emotionally where she should be as a tween,0.1331699
she actually I think had the emotional capacity and maturity of like a six or seven year old and I don't want to give anything away,0.22861414
that's you could imply,0.086669
that's part of the message of the film,0.055766053
but she just seemed um you know a little bit not developed enough for the age that she was supposed to be in the film,0.17442393
and I think that also made it hard to emotionally connect because she didn't seem like a real fully realized character I mean I know the joy had to be uh but I think that Riley needed to be as well and cuz it just kind of created the idea that joy was Riley and I'm like wait a minute are you saying I'm not my own self,0.13923371
I just again I applaud Pixar for trying to depict the human mind no easy task,0.18969226
and I think that they gave it a decent shot but all the dots don't connect I'd also say that I think this is not a good film for children,0.23474324
why,0.05168617
well I think that the messages of the film won't be appreciated by children,0.121438146
I think they're a little bit too adult I also think the middle of the film is just downright as I said boring,0.37021986
I mean they're gonna be like I'm super bored,0.07545603
I mean I was like oh man,0.13091686
maybe,0.038781885
I should like go get another snack from the concession,0.10862909
stand like I was really like oh I'm not having a good time,0.10375853
and then also it wouldn't be a Pixar movie if someone didn't commit suicide,0.34228295
ah pics aw you just can't help yourself we'll talk about that more in the spoiler review so at the end of the day,0.11699061
I guess I have to say that inside out is certainly on provement on some of the films that Pixar has been making lately,0.11069093
but at the end of the day they're just a little bit too inside their own heads on this one alright,0.43125144
that's my non-spoiler review,0.07007341
I look forward to talking about the movie with you down below in the comments,0.320881
this is the non-spoiler review,0.07875931
