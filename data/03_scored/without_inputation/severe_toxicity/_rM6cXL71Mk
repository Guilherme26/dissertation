hello and welcome to episode 235 of the epic film challenge to a thousand one,0.06290043
movies you must see before you die from 1950 All About Eve I really wished,0.30441996
I'd made this review in fact I think they did film a version of this,0.06129468
many many weeks ago I've sold this film for the first time six weeks ago,0.027987601
and the heatwave hit it was just impossible to film a video I tried and,0.051614925
it was just a terrible video and there have been so many reviews and videos,0.12678799
in this series where I thought you know I'm really happy and proud of that,0.013139373
review what I said about the film I articulated myself on why I liked it,0.056418218
why I didn't like it had never been plenty of videos where I feel like,0.041734952
I've done a really bad job and this is a film I feel like I,0.04331277
need to do at least a decent job well because it's it's worth it it's,0.05787896
one of those films that's really special and I need to try and convey that,0.03776181
in the best way I possibly can so hopefully I can still do that even,0.02602531
though it's many many weeks since I've saw it but I will say that you,0.023928652
know what six weeks ago since then I've probably seen twenty thirty films maybe more,0.03984716
than that and it's more fresh in my mind than most of the films I've,0.040943384
seen since then it has that impact it has that staying power I've never seen,0.020114489
it before had heard about it one of those classic titles all about Eve Bette,0.023867454
Davis and I was assuming that Eve was going to be a character played by,0.008066017
Bette Davis but it's not and this film was hugely successful when it came out,0.04477883
in 1951 the Academy Award for Best Picture Best Director best script Best Supporting Actor,0.009413014
for George Sanders it's it really just swept the board and was nominated and one,0.029337924
other kind of awards as well and it's interesting to me that this film came,0.030888468
out in 1950 the same year as a little movie called Sunset Boulevard which they,0.027081622
can draw a lot of parallels between those two movies they're both about an aging,0.039936297
actress and you know that there's similar themes they're very different films but there's a,0.038297947
there's a thread of similarity that that kind of joins them together at least of,0.10335224
all the fact that they came out in the same year anyway Bette Davis stars,0.024509357
as Margo Channing a theatre actress a very famous stage actress who's in her forties,0.06157073
now and she's kind of feeling it you know she's one of those women who,0.12818089
are kind of her presence fills up the entire room she's a very boisterous very,0.11187391
kind of a strong strong-willed a strong personality one of those types of people and,0.07605178
but at the same time she does have that kind of sensitivity to her and,0.03300242
she does have that kind of jacked out of you know am I getting too,0.16301323
old to play these same parts over and over again you know she's still successful,0.05813306
but as far as her own eyes are concerned and what she sees in the,0.030384924
mirror she can tell that she's getting old or getting older at least and Eve,0.04976771
is a young doe-eyed woman who is besotted with Margo Eve Harrington she goes to,0.2742409
see Margo at the play that she's currently performing in every single day multiple times,0.03417514
a day you know she'll see all the performances and she gets taken in she's,0.06984096
outside of the theater at the beginning of the movie she gets taken in by,0.03763875
Margo's friend like come and meet her you know if you're such a big fan,0.04828701
we'll come and see her backstage oh no no I couldn't possibly you know Eva's,0.09820705
very meek but she goes backstage and she meets Margo who kind of takes takes,0.08361624
a bit of a liking to it we kind of get to hear Eve's backstory,0.028495802
about losing her husband and she kind of you know tells him where she is,0.079577915
now in her life and it isn't a very nice story so Margo takes pity,0.115948826
on even says come with me and you can be my assistant and so Eve,0.035325907
is very happy and very glad to take on the the mantle of assisting Margo,0.08299297
in any way she can now Margo already has an assistant kind of called birdy,0.088984944
played by thalma Ritter and birdy doesn't really trust eat when she comes into the,0.029151672
fold and you know very much takes a quick distrust stance to Eve and everything,0.035635885
that she seems to be standing for she kind of comes into the you know,0.08496324
in into the that the family of actors and this this theatre life Thelma Ritter,0.06242549
is an awesome actress I love her in everything I've seen her and she has,0.012746914
such character to us she has such a strong essence and I see things in,0.027125524
her that I've seen in women I've known growing up my life and I'd be,0.15715297
very surprised if they'll maritza and real life wasn't what you would call maybe a,0.14932707
tough broad you know she she just has such character to her and it's no,0.059057
different in this film to she's such a joy to watch and I liked how,0.047091678
birdies kind of you know kind of just looking around the corner you know kind,0.05914547
of so to speak even and what Eve is doing in the household anyway so,0.015506761
this the story is about Margo and it's about Eve what I love about this,0.020646635
film such a great move we open with a scene at an award ceremony a,0.016253097
very kind of upper-class kind of posh kind of award ceremony for theater actors you,0.110574804
know very posh stuff and we see these people sad the tables we see Margo,0.08149431
we see the character played by George Sanders I forget his name and he's kind,0.013223851
of a theater critic and he's a very very vital character in the story and,0.0273304
we kind of hear this narration that's setting up what we're about to see which,0.015025834
is the this prestigious award being given to Eve Harrington so the film kind of,0.018884564
spoils at the beginning the Eve goes on to being actress herself and so I,0.037530325
think the real crux of this movie as it progresses and as it goes on,0.044633158
is you thinking as the audience what are Eve's motives what is she really in,0.02352555
this for you know it's birdie right to distrust her you know or we just,0.055131085
thinking the worst along with her - and I love that about it and I,0.11151271
love that really Eve isn't in the film that much I mean she's in it,0.035831448
plenty but if you were to take that to our running time and really look,0.024239957
at how many minutes she's on screen it's not I don't think as many as,0.03860127
you would expect for someone whose name is in the title of the movie I'd,0.024130868
say Margo gets the lion's share of screen credit of the screen time and I,0.00735161
guess screen credit but it's more about it it's it's in the title All About,0.015924497
Eve let me tell you all about Eve before she gets up to the stage,0.023359254
to accept the award that they make the beginning of the film before we've even,0.009517448
seen her on screen we flash back to to Eve outside the theater and being,0.01057775
brought in to meet Margo and we see the whole story progressed at the very,0.013955553
end of the film we see Eve except the award and so we get to,0.013527839
see how that's that kind of that sequence that that's that series of events leads,0.019811165
us to her receiving this award loves how they did it a really cool framing,0.043443143
device but also just how we really get a feeling of Eve through other characters,0.022229772
perspectives and how they feel about how what they think about what she's doing you,0.046921387
know she becomes an assistant to Margo and then you know things progressed from that,0.031682033
I don't to spoil too much more of what happens even though I kind of,0.035198856
told you what happens at the beginning which in in effect kind of tells you,0.024984963
what happens at the end but it's all about the journey to that destination and,0.015822059
how it happens why it happens and and what kind of gets destroyed in the,0.15538889
process Bette Davis is unbelievable as Margo Channing I had one of my favorite performances,0.0539138
I think she's so full of fire in this film you know there's some really,0.18379423
great incredible writing in the film which only lends itself well to insanely quotable lines,0.052638642
from the film one that really stood out to me that actually I noted down,0.018387007
just so I got a completely ripes I didn't want to paraphrase it and get,0.055687845
it wrong I have it here on my phone when Margo is having a particularly,0.07527218
kind of feisty back and forth with someone she says everyone has a heart except,0.03353124
for some people that's just a killer line that's such a great line and there's,0.11609783
some really funny witty moments in the film there's a character played by Marilyn Monroe,0.012764209
who's this kind of ditzy blonde an aspiring actress she isn't very good and you,0.1294933
know the George Sanders character says well you can just go to television you know,0.023954593
and she says tell me did they have auditions for television and he replies that's,0.028964091
all television is my dear she's just fantastic line there's lots of kind of funny,0.051427342
moments in the film but you're still really invested in this story and what happens,0.011235617
and and and and how the characters kind of combust and and into play and,0.032389786
everything and it's an incredible cast of characters and some great actors obviously Marilyn Monroe,0.03008426
I still haven't really seen anything in Maryland where I haven't seen her most famous,0.028876288
films I don't know if she a good actress I couldn't tell you anything about,0.087898694
her but the seer in this film was fun but she's a very small role,0.09394522
and Baxter as Eve you know knowing what happens throughout the whole course of the,0.010688171
film and what her character is where she's from why she's doing what she's doing,0.0438223
her performance gets even better once you can know all that backstory you know because,0.055563454
again she seems so meek and innocent at the beginning and and then to see,0.045863748
where her true her true intentions lie and how that manifests itself I thought was,0.12834851
was super bleep laid by Anne Baxter now apparently Anne Baxter kind of put herself,0.18345566
forward to be nominated for the the Best Actress Award and they were going to,0.0061083813
put her for Best Supporting but Bette Davis was also at for Best Actress and,0.029586038
so the the general consensus or the the belief is that by having both of,0.019465934
them competing for the Best Actress Award kind of cancel each other out and neither,0.032620605
of them won which I think it's kind of a travesty cuz I think Bette,0.27772298
Davis her name was all over that Oscar I think she did an amazing job,0.027376298
in this film she's so so good at being you know being angry and spiteful,0.24068378
but showing that vulnerability in a few moments you know you really see the the,0.026507568
hearts and the humanity of this woman I really thought the way the film was,0.13121612
starting she would be kind of a cold uncaring character but there is there is,0.03953652
a lot of heart to Margo and I think that Bette Davis really made that,0.014592798
character even better than it could have been if someone else had played it I,0.03318202
think and another great kind of little bit trivia that I noted down as well,0.14825414
was that her boyfriend in the film bill I think his name was the actor,0.032993108
Gary Meryl I'm not sure if they kind of hooked up while making the film,0.039924324
or if they were already together but you know soon after this they got married,0.026426416
and soon after the film came out All About Eve Bette Davis implored Joseph L,0.008916122
mankiewicz to write a sequel to All About Eve that would focus on the characters,0.06308003
of Margo and Bill it was built and played by her lover on and off,0.091067635
screen Gary Merrill many years later after she and Meryl had married and divorced Bette,0.016976817
Davis ran into mankiewicz at a party and said to him Joe you can forget,0.08325705
about that sequel I played it out and it doesn't which is another fantastic story,0.020115819
but you can really see the chemistry between the two Celeste home was very good,0.013277066
in the film too I think the only real weak link in the film is,0.020077238
Hugh Malo who plays Lloyd Richards the the the playwright who Rahu's who's written the,0.018127585
play that Margo is currently starring in he's okay but he kind of really stands,0.038029213
out like a sore thumb amidst all this amazing acting going on with everyone else,0.15575142
around him so he really does kind of stand out a bit as not being,0.09475741
as great as the other members of the cast great acting fantastic writing are really,0.023882754
tightly kind of paced and plotted and edited and and shot story that just keeps,0.09687535
you hooked throughout the entire duration I just was so intrigued to see how Eve,0.029642578
Harrington got to that point where she was winning this award and and I just,0.019295648
I loved it I thought was an amazing film is it fun we should see,0.046522945
before you die it absolutely is how you know criticism of art but also how,0.16375558
this character but played by George Sanders he he was using his kind of status,0.024800042
as a critic of the theater in the wrong ways you know for the wrong,0.038248725
reasons and and and looking at something like that and how people like that do,0.04974842
have power in situations in circles like for that because you're looking at these characters,0.023142405
in the old they all live in this bubble of the theater you know you,0.08522
have George Sanders he's a theater critic we have the playwright you know we have,0.017504308
all these people who act as the actors the assistants so I liked seeing just,0.050961714
that that world even though it doesn't really look at the the actual theater stuff,0.020694528
itself we never really see stuff on stage as far as the actual play is,0.01734666
concerned there's a brilliant scene set on this a theatre stage but it doesn't really,0.021718247
delve into the craft of that but more just the people who are involved in,0.017924704
it and their lives outside of it you know but how it's still the theater,0.03226806
is looming larger of everything they do it's it's their life but I like how,0.038005933
you know we saw the outside of that and just kind of that the human,0.095717266
interactions outside of this performance and also again as I was saying I love how,0.04970186
everything is framed from other people's perspectives and remembrances of Eve how they came in,0.021878555
to how she came into their lives and how she ultimately got to the place,0.076816075
that she is at the beginning and end of the film so I think that's,0.03857267
about as much as I can say I hope it's been a right again I,0.050289214
just feel like this film was so great that I just I really needed to,0.02988537
do a good job of reviewing it and maybe I'm just overthinking that it doesn't,0.02904724
really matter but you can tell I love the film obviously and I highly would,0.01988633
highly recommend you seeing I'll watch it on Netflix so if it's still on Netflix,0.02572132
go check it out you can it's a click of a button away and it's,0.08210362
