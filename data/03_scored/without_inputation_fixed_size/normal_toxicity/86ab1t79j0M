hey everyone i'm mariana and let's talk about one of my most anticipated films of,0.1187608
the year Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk I don't think there's a point in me describing the,0.063233055
plot it's exactly what it sounds like world war ii Dunkirk evacuation that's the whole,0.103003494
movie and Christopher Nolan really takes a different approach to a war film here compared,0.095809065
to what we're used to seeing from movies like this it's not a story of,0.057391576
one person's heroism or a story of a smaller group of people getting personal during,0.12730572
the war or a story that involves strategic planning it's none of these things this,0.07709834
is about survival in a very specific situation there is very little dialogue there is,0.061477922
essentially no exposition or backstory from the beginning you are thrown right into the action,0.14326732
and you are just stressed as hell for an hour and 46 minutes now if,0.44942746
you're like me you were probably a little surprised by the pg-13 rating when I,0.15303805
heard that that's what it was earlier this year I was a little skeptical how,0.052110642
is Nolan going to pull off a war film without an r-rating well he does,0.15563941
and it is one of the best war films I've ever seen he does it,0.13916175
with tension he doesn't was sound he doesn't with scale and to be quite honest,0.15057406
I was blown away by this film what's interesting is that no one makes a,0.13181177
very conscious choice not to get the audience familiar with the characters because Dunkirk is,0.04383964
not about any one person's story you don't get to find out what their friends,0.08371751
and family situation is you don't know what their hopes and dreams are because that's,0.10712612
really not the point where other directors may take an approach that is more personal,0.07300613
nolan really wants this audience to understand that on this beach while they may all,0.13365363
be different people they're also all the same waiting for ships hoping to get home,0.12365657
trying to survive another day he challenges the audience to root for all of these,0.09039658
soldiers because it's a terrible situation and because war is more than one person's story,0.11777899
we get three different perspectives beach water and air which helps us piece together the,0.044931
overall picture and while each of these perspectives has their own set of characters the,0.03888865
dialogue is very minimal because there's no reason for them to explain anything they know,0.08123265
what the situation is they're only going to talk when it's necessary and yet even,0.057898786
though we know very little about these people we still get a sense of what,0.100790136
kind of people they are the cast is perfect and I really liked that Nolan,0.15525107
used his stars sparingly while giving a lot of attention to less familiar faces Tom,0.0923277
Hardy and Mark Rylance are probably the biggest names here but they're not there to,0.094630234
show off their performances are beautifully subtle I really appreciated that personally I'm a big,0.07084598
fan of Killian Murphy and he has some great moments here too Finn Whitehead place,0.56152993
Tommy who's our lead character on the beach and though I haven't seen him in,0.06769868
anything else I'm definitely hoping to see more of him in future films he did,0.15123701
really really well and guess what who knew Harry Styles could act to be honest,0.05640599
I would not know that that's who it was that the internet wasn't buzzing about,0.10072734
it for months now because I know next to nothing about one direction but you,0.084578454
know if you are going into this film and you're afraid that you're going to,0.11977143
I roll throughout the whole thing because of Harry Styles he's actually pretty good in,0.075054444
it obviously this is a visually stunning film I don't think we would expect anything,0.099685185
less from Christopher Nolan at this point he knows what he's doing you absolutely must,0.10109337
see dunkirk on the biggest screen you can I saw it at IMAX and that,0.15192987
was some experience also the wonderful Hans Zimmer score is going to play a really,0.05598713
big role in how stressed out you're going to be while watching this movie it's,0.16007571
the ticking bomb type of score that's the best way I can describe it and,0.26781043
it just builds and builds as things are escalating on screen and as you would,0.10316337
expect it gets loud which along the fact that every shot and explosion you hear,0.24101423
sounds very crisp just adds to the overall tension this movie is all tension no,0.10550976
extraneous movie just tension I could talk about this movie for much longer but I,0.072575524
don't want to get into spoilers there were moments that were terrifying to me despite,0.07183395
the lack of graphic violence there were moments that had me tearing up there was,0.18991314
some beautiful powerful writing and there despite the very minimal amount of dialogue I was,0.066719435
rooting for all these characters and I was consistently stressed from the beginning to the,0.042007763
end of the film and I really do appreciate the different kind of approach Nolan,0.052495413
took with this dunkirk was a very memorable and impactful experience for me so here,0.13653497
