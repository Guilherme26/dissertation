um as you can see my reviews can be arthouse e as well what's up guys,0.14637984
and gals Jared here with another fancy-pants Oscar bait type movie review so Netflix you know Netflix wants to get in the game of kind of award-worthy movies and they just released a new one called roma roma takes place in 1970 and follows Cleo a maid for a household of Sophia her husband and four kids as the story continues it's an emotional journey for both Cleo who is dealing with her own personal stuff and Sophia who is trying to keep her family together,0.060941387
so as Roma all of the buzz people have been talking about,0.14958167
let's find out now before I get into my thoughts,0.27843198
let me know what you guys thought of Roma in the comments down below are you a big fan of Alfonzo her own and did you really kind of like this foreign film aspect,0.23103829
now let's get into some of the good things this film did first things first I'm gonna say that Roma might not be for everyone one,0.13748528
if you're not into black and white movies not gonna work,0.35588
if you're not into reading subtitles or it being in a foreign,0.11103677
language probably not gonna work,0.094187796
and this is a very much art,0.07241359
houseing personalized story,0.046559643
so if you're not into that Roma's probably not gonna be there for you,0.1520511
anyways getting the into Roma,0.07991385
this is a very beautifully shot film,0.17882815
I mean obviously,0.081766024
it was a bold choice,0.0919264
or the directors choice to have this all in black and white hold on a sec but you know a lot of the shots that he has in this film are really enhanced by that black and white color choice from the opening credits of having the skyline reflected on to like the wet tile of the floor or the closing kind of sequence of having this wondrous beautiful sunset in the background when they're on the beach through and through I personally think that Roma is one of the most beautiful films of 2018 and it's not just the beautiful shots,0.14867193
but there's also these really good or really satisfying tracking shots following Clio as she kind of her and her friend go down a street,0.2414488
and it follows them or when she's in the house of Sofia and she's going through and turning off all the lights before bedtime,0.07907505
it really the camera just kind of follows her throughout this sequence and it's really satisfying,0.058987636
also korone did this thing maybe he wants twice maybe three times in this movie where the main character or the characters that we are focused we're in the foreground and it's a very emotional time in those characters lives,0.046888653
but in the background there's kind of like light-hearted fun happiness going on so it's really this dual like emotional aspect,0.07469235
that's really almost like it's satisfying,0.071333244
but also cruel at the same time it was a little off-putting,0.15484472
the first time I saw but again korone knew what he was doing in this film and it really ties everything together as for the story in Roma,0.053695258
it really has this kind of main storyline it's very emotional,0.08550298
and it follows Cleo as she you know she's this made for this family of a wife her husband and four kids,0.15248121
but then as the story kind of goes on you get more in depth into her story you find out that she gets pregnant the guy isn't really the best guy she has to go through all of this emotional stuff by herself and it's just,0.08426013
it's a really heartbreaking story,0.03798303
I will say that right away it kind of felt like a cliched story where you know this one person gets pregnant the guy leaves her but then it does take these twists,0.09853045
and turns that again are very emotional very painful and it's just it's not something that you're really used to and next to the main storyline of Cleo,0.2408207
and what she has to really deal,0.08995978
with,0.024530113
there's also kind of this subtle it kind of takes more screen time towards the end story between Sophia her husband and the four kids and the family in general basically Sophia's husband is this doctor he obviously it's revealed that he's kind of cheating,0.1759039
he has a mistress,0.29923984
so that's really taking a toll on Sophia and the kids and it shows how she has to really struggle between keeping her life together or keeping her emotions in check while also you know kind of putting on this facade for the kids before she can officially tell them,0.0862406
it's these dual stories that really keep things interesting and makes the story kind of flow on and again Sophia and Cleo actually kind of come together at the end,0.09162865
and they're there for each other through honestly some of the emotional stuff that they've ever had to deal with in their lives,0.121904224
however I did not think that Roma was as perfect as some critics are saying obviously,0.11312823
it takes on this foreign film aspect,0.13843243
there's subtitles there's black-and-white you got to get over that stuff,0.33937222
but my lord this movie is slow and I mean solo,0.17972434
it's definitely more of an arthouse he kind of needs type movie and there's a lot of shots or sequences that are supposed to hang on you as a viewer and it does hang on you,0.36247492
but sometimes it's focusing or looking at certain things for much too long,0.053027608
and the shot just it just carries on also like I said that it's you know this art house the indie type of film there were some scenes that just felt out of place,0.08731474
I honestly I didn't even you know what just lets roll one of them over all Roma is this uniquely shot in emotional driven film with some beautiful shots korone really toying with our emotions and this emotional twofold story that floats throughout but with it unfolding very much slowly and some art housey type material I'd recommend checking out Roma if you have the chance I mean pretty much,0.17315537
everyone has Netflix so you know turn it on give it a try in closing,0.13613415
I'm gonna give Roma four point four out of five emotional black-and-white shots,0.31400785
