a slightly backyard wait a minute evenly hey everyone is Charlotte from pier weights and today we're going to be reviewing black clansmen which is directed by Spike Lee I was also produced by Jason Blum and Jordan pilling you know if we get out and then it stars a Jason David Washington Adam driver and Topher Grace and so there's movie centers around the true story of Ron Stallworth,0.019269345
this is based on actually a memoir that the real Bryan Stallworth wrote about about him being the first black detective in the Colorado Springs Police Department and also to how he was successfully able to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan job yes a black man when it infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan and didn't nobody know not a damn thing about it okay,0.4419351
so before I get into this can we go ahead and give a shout out to AMC any of seems really trying to come up in the world think I've been late EMC stubs letting people try to battle a movie pass and stuff and now they also all of their Dobies cinemas through are for the country,0.08087342
they actually screamed black Klansmen four days early you still have to spend them coins,0.5516788
but I was happy that I was able to go buy a ticket and support the college out especially since I went him right into the Free Press brain mmm but yes so you just want to give them a little shout out and know I didn't get paid for this thing,0.15047717
you running me no money they,0.23021804
ain't giving me no check okay,0.13819514
so I have to say that before I really get into the review of the film where I also want to address the release date of this movie so I know a lot of people for those of you who don't know the August,0.11175434
season is kind of the end of the blockbuster season,0.047215767
so blockbuster season ends tour ends in July and always they're kind of like the films where their studios are testing out working kind of go either way it could be a good movie or it can be a bad movie,0.08285481
and so it's like a paper like,0.16362791
why is this movie coming out during August like doesn't mean,0.06286925
it's not good,0.14892717
but I want to educate people let them know that movie has some significance to the timing of this release date,0.09008345
it comes out during the leaking of where the Charlottesville is that it happened from last year,0.04500485
and so I just wanted to let people know for those of you who might not have known of many of you may have already know just to give you a little background on the median and the significance behind this film and the timing of its release,0.07016273
so let's get into the review,0.08632351
yeah,0.040847696
so I have to say that I really enjoyed this film first of all I was watching this,0.06666275
am I just like damn way,0.43976647
I got just enough,0.041920092
- I was talking to two different people that like different times like they voices sound exactly the same,0.083863944
like,0.02861636
yeah I don't think nothing was up,0.11093815
like I'm trying to figure out what shall work routing process if I will see where I can take that much to get in the Ku Klux Klan but I'm just trying to figure out how to jog it who boozled,0.18467587
okay,0.05096789
so when they stand out for me would have to be John David Washington and also Topher Grace I'm so John Neville Washington,0.06597612
many of you who may know he is a son of Denzel one of the greatest actors ever and he also um is in the TV show ballers which is one of my favorites and is coming back on Sunday,0.123422086
yeah so um he was very entertaining playing Ron stallworth,0.14797115
and so one of the favorite things he's very charismatic on screen,0.1039741
he's very funny how he says the work,0.08291728
oh wait why I can't even say how he says it,0.12845947
but even when I saw in a trailer just like how does he say why won't they like quite,0.07484596
why kind of like I'm like I don't know I'm just but you know one of the things that I will have to say outside of it talking about racism,0.31089434
and one of the themes that had explored with his character was how being a black man and being a cop like how hard something like that will be in either something that many people go through today,0.18370439
and I thought it was a very important topic to touch upon I'm just because it is exploring his viewpoint as being a black man and seeing how african-americans are treated in America and him trying to fight for the cause but also to him wanting to inflict change from within by being a detective by making sure that he can kind of train change the perceptions of people by working on the others but how they could be stressful,0.42527288
and how it can also be trying because many of those who you are trying to give a voice to give the voice to the voiceless they now they feel like you've betrayed your own race,0.29425395
because you are working for the same people who inflict pain upon us,0.23255488
so I thought it was very interesting for them to touch upon that and kind of show a different viewpoint of what a black man will deal with while being a man in uniform,0.53490317
and so also - I think what Spike Lee does a well here is he talks about a very heavy and just a heavy topic and many will say that is a divisive topic about racism and how even exploring racism through the Ku Klux Klan and back in that time and kind of shown the parallels of how we're dealing with the same things in today's society I think that he does a very good job on educating both sides and giving a material that is kind of is,0.15644924
heavy but due to the comedy of the film of the satire in the film it kind of eases you into kind of that viewpoint or talking about that topic of,0.13954507
racism I was,0.40130603
laughing and then like in the middle me black because I was just like yo this is things stuff that be,0.26881817
happening but it's funny because they're like making fun of it then I'm like damn but this is I really,0.5154597
happening and there's a scene in the film where I kind of talked about like they would this would never,0.07068038
happen I'm like,0.05026776
bread but it's happening,0.097132966
right now sorry both,0.052826922
laugh,0.08497426
and then I was shook cuz,0.11481491
I was like whoa,0.18602668
why is this happening right,0.07618241
now just can't even believe this but I think that audiences will really appreciate how Spike Lee decides to tell this story through the satire but also putting in real reminisce and showing history through through movies through the organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and how some of these things that we may take lightly or may not even think of the effect that it had dealing with racism like how that is prevalent today and kind of how racism has evolved into a political landscape,0.16497137
and so I would say Topher Grace is the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan,0.15493576
he was a second to me,0.09379475
I'm just in this portrayal and his relationship or on stallworth the conversations that they had it's just crazy because you're laughing cuz you're just like this is so little Prince but people really think this way,0.3075966
and the fact that this is a true story like the whole time I just like yeah I can't even believe that this is true story man all this craziness happened,0.24551342
and so it shows even through Adam drivers character Flip Zimmerman who is Jews man who was playing Ryan Sauber it's in person when he was meeting with the Ku Klux Klan because obviously the real rocks are worth Kengo typical of his scheme but yeah so even showing his progression and how he never really paid attention to racism,0.36362565
but being in this type of society in his organization and seeing how they act in how they infiltrate all parts of society from being cops er just in the small towns and it's just crazy like watching this an entire film I really think that everyone did a very great job with the material that was given to them,0.44668728
now I will say there's a little bit of a peace an issue with this film it's a little bit over two hours,0.11948835
and at some point I could really feel that it was two hours,0.062273968
but for a majority of the entire film it was still entertaining and enjoying for me what I love is towards the end of the film how Spike Lee he takes you on this journey through satire and retelling this true story but then at the end he kind of ties you or kind of brings you back into your reality because the whole purpose of the movies are kind of to escape into a different world,0.066091225
but how he chooses to tie this in and bring the audience back to the reality of what we're dealing with today in today's society I thought it was brilliant,0.058302242
it was amazing,0.06680872
I got emotional torture in the film I'm not gonna spoil it for how he did that but I really enjoyed this film I think Spike Lee did a very very drive,0.31089434
I think that audiences are gonna enjoy this film,0.09969277
I think the timing for this film is perfect,0.062779725
and I think this is going to be a huge success,0.059216287
and this is really going to kind of happen,0.07724637
a lot of people been saying like Spike Lee bit off lately but he backed out even though he didn't really be back,0.15281403
okay,0.050967902
so for me for my Klansmen,0.094082445
I would have to say that you paid to see this film in theaters,0.16414182
I thought it was amazing,0.08123981
I absolutely loved it,0.055839743
I would encourage everyone to go support this movie to watch this movie and to learn from this movie,0.11568619
so as always those are my thoughts on black Klansmen,0.2599931
