Best Actress Award at the Golden Globes couple of nights ago for her performance as,0.022632873
Queen and Queen Anne you say who is Queen Anne well Queen Anne was a,0.033950973
queen of England yes funny enough in the early 1700s now I don't know very,0.13116091
much about Queen n when I was all about 16 or something I learnt a,0.07001856
mnemonic which is blong 4 6 8 9 which stands for the battles of Blenheim,0.04479413
families Luton odd and mal placa in 1704 1706 1708 and 1709 and that was,0.026989162
doing a war against the French during the reign of Queen Anne but I don't,0.07516309
know much about her apart from that now what happens in this film well this,0.046858862
film is about Queen Anne a not a mad monarch but certainly a monarch with,0.069744505
her issues I suppose is what we could so we'd say to it in this,0.02861354
in this modern day and she has a lesbian relationship with a couple of people,0.28187907
one of whom is lady MOBA who is the wife of John Churchill ancestor of,0.01135535
Winston Churchill the first Duke of Alba who was gifted Blenheim by a grateful nation,0.024357695
after his victories against the French now in this film lady Marber is portrayed as,0.065188
not just the power behind the throne but in almost you could say the power,0.017417168
inside the throne as she spends a certain amount of time nuzzling nuzzling is that,0.045627605
a good word nuzzling up to Queen Anne until she is supplanted in Anne's affections,0.060109984
by Emma Stone who plays a lady who has fallen from grace to become a,0.04764511
servant girl for some other complicated reason and then as a consequence of her becoming,0.081570804
the favorite of the Queen Queen Anne and develops a bigger place at court and,0.05349141
in an intense rivalry with Lady mor burr who is played by Rachel Weisz and,0.017622044
must-own plays Abigail that's the name of the other lady now couple of things about,0.021326452
this film that are wonderful the first thing is it's a film about women and,0.06715694
the three lead characters are women there are men characters who sort of dance around,0.09694719
them but they're not lead characters these are three strong interesting powerful women and if,0.12357582
that isn't a statement about Hollywood in these modern days I don't know what is,0.012386384
and let's have more of it guys the other thing is it's very funny it's,0.030833922
very rude the certificate is a 15 and when you see the certificate and at,0.062452763
the front of the film it's there's strong sex scenes so oh dear but there,0.24920212
weren't any strong sex scenes there's a little strong sexual language and there is a,0.22431521
lot of sexual innuendo and it is very well handled but there isn't a lot,0.19819745
of sex scene so you can take your 15 year old I think it's 15,0.52780306
you can tell your children this certain amount of what's the word lack of fear,0.07229681
they'd probably rather go and see spider-man in the spider verse but this is a,0.027867204
fabulous film now it reminded me very strongly of three other films the first and,0.03942211
perhaps most obviously is the madness of King George where Nigel Havers played George the,0.09901258
third in his descent into madness and it's film it's it's set in a similar,0.15820993
period not quite the same period but very similar period the second film it reminded,0.021047076
me of is Barry Lyndon Stanley Kubrick's film starring Ryan O'Neal of all people and,0.0459449
the reason for that is that Kubrick's film was shot entirely with natural light lots,0.07755842
of scenes lit purely by candles and large parts of this film are lit either,0.046582144
by candles or just by fly alight and it is beautifully lit beautifully filmed the,0.03482569
interiors are sumptuous the costumes are fabulous it is an absolutely wonderful piece of filmmaking,0.10008287
in that sense the third film it reminded me of is Peter Greenaway the draftsmen,0.032742336
contract which is about probably 30 35 years old now and and it reminded me,0.018569266
of that because of its episodic nature now though it's divided up into a series,0.037985977
of chapters eight chapters I think in each chapter has a little title and then,0.026709784
the scene follows on from that the music is also very similar to the music,0.011981953
that Philip Glass that was it Philip Glass that Peter Greenaway was it Phillippe loss,0.0717946
I think so I thought Peter Greenaway used or was it Michael Nyman actually I,0.023335308
think it was not from Michael Nyman sorry I'm getting a bit confused here anyway,0.041762225
the music is very similar to the music in the draftsmen contract I did find,0.029437702
at certain places in this film that the music was rather intrusive a bit too,0.052896734
loud and a little bit annoying so just a minor criticism there the other minor,0.20804217
criticism I would have is that one point one of the characters says from now,0.008885523
on it's okay now I not sufficient of a student of the English language to,0.10533383
know for certain whether the word okay was in common parlance in 1708 at the,0.03386184
court of Queen Anne but somehow I doubt I doubt it anyway back to the,0.021654388
film it is a wonderful film it is beautifully acted Olivia Colman is brilliant Emma,0.10463272
Stone is excellent Rachel Weisz is excellent the minor characters are all excellent it is,0.025982738
superb super hard to think of enough good things to say about this film one,0.13190126
does kind of wonder not well not wonder when kind of longs for a time,0.052020688
when our monarchs were mad can't really say mad can you but you want a,0.039708138
monarch that is absolutely and utterly corrupted and destroyed by power and our monarchs are,0.23949276
kind of you know they're becoming close to normal people I don't think we want,0.16398174
that and I don't think I want Prince Harry as a normal person I want,0.12296651
him as a mad crazed pal obsessed lunatic monarch I if I'm gonna be ruled,0.47787425
by a royal family and I did test the idea of being ruled by law,0.032862734
finally but if I'm going to be ruled by the wall family and it looks,0.0314113
like I am until death us do part I want it to be moved I,0.385499
want I want my royalty to be off the wall that's Queen Anne I mean,0.09733233
she's not mad can't say mad but she is she has issues she has issues,0.09256429
and the issues are not really resolved so the film is funny it is sad,0.01132209
it is tragic it is enlightening I have no idea how close to the truth,0.028098688
it is and I don't really care it is an master class in filmmaking and,0.03654519
filmmaking for adults it's not a children's film it's not a film for young people,0.07472939
it's a film for thinking that sounds a bit snobbish it's a film for thinking,0.21462284
adults I saw it as I always do at the dunnage picture house with my,0.1113411
darling wife Jane and we loved it we saw it on Monday Monday's cheap seats,0.050363716
day which means the cinema is full of people who have plenty of money but,0.04443227
like a bargain and there are a few things that annoy me more than somebody,0.12014481
who has money and likes a bargain and we were there on a Monday because,0.033259183
we like a bargain but if you want to see a great film and possibly,0.032669164
the best film of 2019 already close second spider-man in the spider-verse that only being,0.031245671
the two films that I've seen so fine 2019 go and see it see you,0.04105048
