really and yeah the third man you know talks about its briefly in my blu-ray collection video I believe so yeah if you've seen that video you maybe know what can't afford having this,0.15549256
film yes it's one of most um and you know claim films of all time of course and awesome roses in this film you know Joseph Cotten of course as well Trevor Howard out of Valley as well so it's got a massive cost even Bernard Lee's in the film and in quite small corner Lee role from him sorry and yeah basically one of my supreme films it's actually being named at one point the greatest British film of all,0.03797649
time,0.050087105
and of course yes very famous film and it's my third year of this film so yes frequently you know listed as one of the best films all time on the science sound such like that I'm DB it's in the top 250 I believe and yeah it's in Houston rotten yeah 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes,0.11554721
and yeah it's just a very very loved film,0.07386775
and I first saw this in 2015 around that time when I you know first watched Citizen Kane actually I kind of watch this in pretty very close proximity because yeah just for awesome Welles really wowed me with Kane,0.08121778
so I just I wanted to watch this and I really could say that these two films actually other most acclaimed ya see the most acclaimed overall films at Baltimore's,0.09344243
Orson Welles is involved in you know of course he didn't direct the film although that is actually controversial,0.0574977
you know some say I've said over the years,0.061441276
it's kind of you know rumors that he at least had a hand in some of the direction,0.15801789
but certainly it's confirmed that he did write along his own Alliance and basically a lot of the famous the most famous lines from the film actually once he wrote,0.036449008
but Graham Greene of course was the main writer you know off the film and he actually wrote a novella before this to prepare which is a really I think an idea that kind of really makes sense to me to write a novella and then adapt it into the script form,0.035403777
I think that's kind of that's the most logical way really,0.061482985
I think it's always one,0.06650616
I've always for you know of basically yeah this film,0.10967126
you know it's deserve a score as well,0.16771875
it's very very famous of course the e theme and just the theme music for our and Roger Ebert would say this is one of the top ten films of all time,0.08070151
at one point,0.059584003
I believe and yes I watched it,0.06060694
and after Susan Cain of course which I absolutely love,0.06956531

and what I think this film is it,0.09083886
one of the best ones all time absolutely this is one of my absolute favorite films a florist masterpiece and just perfect in its form in its tone,0.11037191
you know just everything about this film is mind blown one of the best fritters of all time and awesome Welles is on fire in this film Joseph Cotten an absolutely wonderful protagonist all performances out of alley,0.15199447
Trevor,0.030294156
Howard is just amazing in the film very charming and the whole film has this charm,0.057573896
yes about this Chandler's there and I at the same time very very cynical,0.34548175
and you know set in of course the main plot which I won't get into too much,0.08102213
you know it's basically Joseph Cotten the beginning the film basically goes to Vienna it's post-world War two Vienna so it's kind of war-torn country you know and all the buildings are different kind of element destroyed half destroyed,0.12220686
and of course there's loads of you know crime and poverty kind of that's true and Joseph Cotten plays Holly Martin's who's basically a pope Western writer,0.13475366
so that's very very interesting,0.058131624
I kind of loved films where it's always very interested in you know when done well and the protagonist or someone is an actual writer,0.09356567
it kind of just you know is really interested in and when they actually kind of discover things that are kind of play into the Conover stories they tell and known for okay it worked perfectly here,0.039241686
and he basically goes to Vienna because he's told by Harry Lime who is basically he's played by Orson Welles in a film and yes you know announcement,0.07805083
now of course I'll just say now and I'll put in the description possible spoilers because I can't really talk about film,0.10722529
you know essentially if you say awesome well is in the film and you know he's hairy like you know some of them of course,0.14980529
in fact that you know,0.059886497
he's not dead,0.2945733
so there's a spoilers of course put warning in the description and yes it's I suppose it's minor spoilers because how can you watch the film and know the lost mothers in it and who plays and not expect him to be in there,0.08195731
he is in the film of course,0.062299374
I didn't have to analysis very well but yeah he's in the film and basically though it's believed at beginning that he is dead and you know once shows of cotton,0.15452173
you know arrives it's learned very very quickly these dead and you know Harry Lime basically invited him in for a job,0.24414165
he offered him a job,0.121160656
and basically yes Holly Martin's arrives and he's shocked and the funeral,0.1356117
he then basically things I'm right you know it doesn't seem right,0.10717553
and you know very very just mysterious the way happened and coincidental and just just not right,0.24212632
so he kind of starts to investigate and you know that many many different leads and he follows,0.045743465
one of the main ones being the cancer that out of Valley plays and she basically she can't afford some but she was of course Harry limes the lover and basically a very very complex relationship you've,0.12781282
got this kind of triangle going on unofficial triangle and yes basically it's basically yes,0.16513883
Holly Martin's kind of discovering or you know all the different clues and seeing you know different characters that were involved with Harry Ron of course Anna of course who had a very plays,0.056979652
it's a big big big character there,0.05004866
and that's she's the one that kind of adds,0.11171716
a lot of depth to this film and the relationships is all in a feather from very complex,0.07962005
and it's all kind of ties in Trevor Howard of course is it is sergeant Calloway,0.06041643
and he basically he has a very big pot rollin film and he of course the gray masterful in the brief in the film brief encounter good she's all mine absolutely loved and wonderful here,0.0835246
I think he has so much to the film just kind of the charm the kind of the comedy that comes is a lot from him,0.09336925
and yeah basically you could say it's a bit complex on paper,0.27752364
but the way it's told the plot it's very very clear storytelling,0.0539047
and it's never convoluted in front of that and it's just one of the most engaging films I've ever seen and you know when I first saw it I was blown away couldn't quite believe it it really did you know many had said is one of the greatest problems,0.113345906
I just kind of straight away,0.40148374
I thought yes I agree,0.054142162
you know,0.07163658
it's one of them films it's just so perfect,0.15106528
you know in every way subset the main plot and of course about 60 minutes in or after that there is a massive reveal of course which I won't really get into too much other than what a masterful review or one of the best in cinema,0.08335053
and that is just it's just such an amazing moment the time in the end the build-up the atmosphere the little hints here,0.06385367
and there the involvement of course of the cats look out for that I can't afford shadow it,0.041228503
and you know just the actual reveal itself you know and the camera movements and the way that the music is used is just perfect that is just one of the best you know kind of most kind of worthy moments in cinema for me,0.055370636
I absolutely love,0.06867287
that moment I'm just so good an opportunist boy,0.36648294
and of course the film was just so perfect,0.054165907
you know it draws you in straightaway,0.16373672
I believe on this release Carol Reed narrated but I'm not too sure on that and there's two different versions Joseph Cotten and Calvary,0.065467894
I think it was Carol reading this one but yes basically Australia join in and you know editor to perfection the way the plot unfolds in this film,0.100933775
it's just masterful storytelling,0.086337835
it's just mr.,0.063188225
I was one of them thrillers that the plot it's not you know completely taken over the characters the characters you know in the atmosphere the city and all this gun stuff and the kind of emotion behind it the values and you know the kind of morals that you know kind of gets into it's all in harmony perfectly with the actual plot,0.1195937
you know,0.07163658
it's not filmed this completely,0.0749054
you know completely dialogue-driven the visual storytelling,0.07275435
of course is very prominent you know,0.067616984
and of course you've got the famous Dutch angles the very program in the film and it's just perfect the way that kind of creates this uneasy atmosphere,0.094260454
that's kind of look to the film all the close-ups as well you know of the kind of even the background characters really early on creates like an atmosphere you know an uneasy feel you know things,0.06315112
you just kind of think of us weird something's not right,0.5154597
and it's just for the visuals alone that is the direction,0.045649465
and cinematography is absolutely perfect in this film as well as just the lighting not just the angles,0.11824838
but the lighting is wonderful the zooms,0.07388734
you know the you know the pushings perfect,0.117633805
the timing is key and it's perfect,0.042457227
and of course adding to that you know the actual River score it's just so perfect you know it's just Lester films of flow and as forms of flows so wonderfully and it's just epic you know just you know every time you know that kind of score comes on and you've got the zooms that everything in addition,0.06547175
the kind of plot points in the film,0.11195902
you know they kind of the notes the kind of perfectly fit into the intro notes within the story,0.07127472
it's just perfect it's just yeah just kind of give you the shows at least it did for me,0.10085896
and you know the characters in the film,0.045168296
you know,0.07163658
I've actually got a film book that actually cites this you know these characters the relationships dynamics you know in a way that it kind of it's all part of this,0.060092974
you know this circle it's all linked in,0.059178267
and of course you can study that and just really know how to tell a story level,0.06277999
he way the cancers or of rolling the story and the way of all kind of they would have ripple effects you know,0.08702614
and what they do,0.05704116
in the film and all the different you know prop ones and it's just so genius all the cancers are so fully fleshed out even as well just the background characters,0.08965264
and there's always been some sort of comedy or just sense of dread as well at times and you know it's just it's just so perfect,0.1091422
you know I think the protagonist is amazing,0.088772774
it's gotten an amazing actor you know,0.06621175
I'm not fan of him Heaven's Gate but I'm a fan of most people in that film apart from Christopher Walken my family film but really nice you know shadow of doubt is great in that Joseph Cotten and Citizen Kane of course as well and of course,0.07202076
it's great to see you know Joseph Cotten an Orson,0.17371109
Welles back together again after Citizen Kane,0.077426866
you know acting in the same film because they're just great to give you,0.10938162
and I think you know as well the actual the actual characters from they play,0.035295393
you know Harry Lime and of course Holly Martin's I think that the parent is great and the dynamics you know kind of in the plays off,0.05633139
the exposition is from you know the backstory of you know how they were friends you know and they're younger and just just the one that the exhibition is told for dialogue just adds so much before the actual reveal happens and you kind of find out of course that Harry lamb is not dead when they're together on screen it's just it's all the more meaningful and just really massively complex relationship so much depth humanity to this from and especially you know through this relationships and they have and the kind of the yeah the backstory between a woman and the way that it kind of pans out as well you know this film has got of course great comedy,0.09641568
but it is also sad at times,0.06327961
and of course not meaty at least ER kind of thing,0.16340372
and I just think the dialogue was absolutely perfect,0.052398432
in this film just you know all the characters in Swan was just so good of course out of alley very very complex,0.071620435
and carrot sir and you know it's got some lifted moments between Aaron of course Joseph Cotton's character but it has got its moving moments,0.082505725
you know as well and ones have really really touched you know touchy and I just think the way it comes together at the end,0.31089434
it's perfect,0.0653506
you know,0.07163658
I think of course the end didn't was meant to be originally there's going to be a more happy ending and you know if you probably anyway if you've seen some of my reviews you know that I or maybe not I do Jenny for happy endings,0.115852185
but it's great when it director kind of writer goes for an ending where you know it is more daring you could say and you know in relation to the rest of tone in the film I think it is perfect really,0.08986782
but yes it is very very dark this film has got silikal moments and just fits perfectly to kind of the locations of course well and the way is trying to portray post,0.06344307
you know world or to Vienna and as well just a whole seediness of it I miss portrayed perfectly you know the atmosphere the tone just free through the visuals of course the angles and everything the uneasy feel the use of them,0.094491206
you know lighting shadows is perfect,0.10563047
you know it's just so good,0.068385504
and of course that plays a massive you know and any actual reveal itself and just it's just wonderful,0.03916509
this film,0.14966646
you know the edge,0.0856163
and as I've said is perfect and it kind of just this film just gets better and better and it's just from start to finish,0.109878644
one of the most thrilling films I've ever seen the chase scenes,0.0929145
you know it's just,0.074205264
it is perfect in this film,0.11082531
he's ever scored by a hands-on class just perfect,0.19156964
you know perfectly suits the action in this film I couldn't think of a more perfect use of music really for that just the way it builds and builds and it kind of you know it kind of hard to explain that there's ever instrument of course kind of it kind of the notes you know kind of sounds almost like tension in itself and the way that you use them in the action the way you know that as the you know tempo of the instrument builds,0.07231058
so does um you know works in harmony with the actual the action itself this is so genius,0.06778991
you know the way it builds,0.1006634
in certain scenes the chase scenes are all just wonderfully done,0.03496384
and you know the finals of 10 minutes of the film just mind-blowing really mixed emotions there you know so many emotions I felt but really at the end of day just just constantly on the edge of my seat and caring about these characters so much and that's you know great fillers,0.06001462
it's not,0.06844308
I can't just have a great feel of really interesting plot,0.086833864
you know I never because you never know care about the characters,0.18463793
and it's not Q manatee in the film it's not one that kind of,0.080966406
yeah these characters going along with this film unraveling the mystery behind something then I'm not you know massively interested,0.12739725
and there's never been a I further really were you know,0.10923557
it's not good characters in from but I love where you could say from most films really in general,0.12040928
but yeah I think this one just perfectly balances out all the elements in that sense and the atmosphere through this film there's almost a match,0.073513225
I think it's just wonderful,0.06110365
and so many things I felt you know as I say the end,0.10990273
it,0.046851434
really you know the ferris wheel scene as well of course,0.10791103
while one of the best moments cinema probably for me just amazing and everything leading up to that,0.05233477
and then you just cover the way you know awesome,0.10247197
I'll just walks into the scene,0.10262504
and of course the actual scene itself you know which just really it's very contemplative put so many things into perspective and it's kind of a clash of you know ideals and very shocking at times you know what the approach,0.15593742
you know this Harry lunch council you know what he reveals initially actually tensions,0.052221704
and he's really is the dark nature of his you know personality,0.17565978
and as well though it's just poetic,0.0581268
the way is told and the way this just shows all these people beneath you know the dots as I say and you know in the relation to the plot now it does get dark,0.08314235
you know the enterprise so a very very shocking,0.09556615
actually you know it involves of course penicillin and stuff like that,0.059790634
and racketeering of course which you shouldn't you soon you know find out you know and really especially once of course a lot most comes into the film you know there's many many you know reveals there but you know really really dark and cynical but it really is just too complex for a human film,0.21839607
and in the end you know just just a masterpiece of a film perfect from start to finish,0.116558686
couldn't flora fauna flora because there's nothing wrong,0.08003423
and just it goes way beyond that though you know this is definitely of course if you if you kind of push this review all of it you know that I love this film it's being very theistic about it,0.15804929
so of course it gets into my hundred percent plus tears now it goes beyond the tear free actually manages to get 107 plus t2 easily and actually very very close to tier 1 this from you know I think he's no,0.13622452
it's not really comparison,0.073944055
but Citizen Kane of course and god tier two,0.06480118
now this is ever,0.055913746
so slightly below sis and came from me I prefer Kane but you know I think both already almost in the level and you know both are very close to tier 1 something both have something absolute finest from his all-time,0.1355347
you know it's just this film is just it's quite dark moments,0.13655731
but it's guys its comedy,0.20106359
its width as charm and the perfect balance of that all the characters just perfectly,0.054793324
you know in terms of the way the design of the the actual you know the circle the kind of the way it intertwines kind of thing and you know be billed from the the slow kind of humble beginnings you know and very very gradual mystery,0.072360635
you know,0.07163658
it's the kind of peaceful stuff which as I've gotten you know,0.055140223
it's kind of you know Holly Holly Martin's you know just ways walking around discovering little things came there slowly injects this kind of atmosphere through the angles perfect placement the least natural the light and friendly shadows,0.122226104
and just the kind of just the way the characters are talking this film,0.110501006
you know very very dark and somber times and as well just how relatable you know Polly Martin's is you know,0.08798301
it's a very very interesting,0.06096542
I was a you know a pop western writer,0.11261676
it's kind of not that successful but then it kind of adds to comedy there as well you know Bernard Lee's character there you know kind of all the scenes there you know great comedy,0.07896492
and this is one of the things just such a funny film at times,0.06522575
but it never goes over the top or anything it's all very very restrained and kind of dry humor you could say and just the perfect placement throughout the film of all of the humor,0.057159428
but you know in terms of direction the cinematography editing perfect really,0.05680422
and this film just it moved me it just thrilled me constantly the action is just wonderful,0.069507316
some of the best action,0.04782985
it's in a more easily the score by a Karass is just perfect,0.25830665
you know zipper score really really it's beautiful and answers' con men and cornfields to film as well the ways used especially in the action scenes and the kind of reveals could not be more you know perfect for this film and just an absolutely flaws from from start to finish,0.13838284
and you know this is a screenplay in this film grain green of course,0.06143457
and of course awesome wells you know the kind of dialogue he added it in that it's just so so meaningful,0.05352521
but it just has such a flow that script just an ease and combine that with just the ease of the direction,0.05797272
you know in this film by Cal,0.14791626
read absolutely masterful direction just perfect,0.061653074
and just the one that yeah it's just all the way to the very end,0.1010138
you know it's just perfect for me,0.11153367
I would say that this is as Citizen Kane is just outside my top 100 films of all time,0.072052546
so really lists this nest is absolutely massive praise I would say it's very very close to my tier 1 and easily,0.077346265
yeah one of the best British films of all time,0.09694144
you know there are better ones definitely and you know it's been compared,0.0917959
you know in British films to the rights of brief encounter the Lawrence of Arabia,0.062009927
I don't think it's as good as in film,0.112147965
so there's kind of hints for when I do my David Lean director series how much I love him and his films especially Lawrence of Arabia yes but definitely one of the best British films one of the best noir films just one of the best films in cinema and highly recommend this film this is Studio canal release,0.09516774
and it's the steelbook recommend that just wonderful cinematic perfection,0.05942908
and one of my most loved films of all time,0.10023605
so thanks watching,0.05175748
my review of Cowell reads absolute masterpiece the third man,0.13799334
