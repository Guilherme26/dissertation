how's it going guys happy october 9th and welcome to my 31 days of halloween marathon today i will be reviewing a movie called you may have heard of it may have not i don't know i'm sure you've heard of it before if you're a hardcore horror movie fan but um it's called the cabinet of dr caligari and um yes it is in 1920 literally made in the year 1920 it's a 1920 german silent film and um yeah now personally i'm not a big fan of black and white movies or silent films of that matter but this one really got to me for some reason i don't know why but i really like this one this movie creeped me out black and white silent movies always creeped me out i don't know why it's just they're so freaky this one especially this is a movie i think if you haven't seen it you all need to see because it just it's such a great movie and you just don't need to see it horrifying or not go watch it the cabinet of dr caligari is about a man named francis and um this is actually one of the very first movies that has ever came out to have the the frame story effect where it's like um you've all seen movies where in the beginning there's like there'll be like two people talking or whatever and they'll say i'm gonna tell you a story and then the whole movie ends up being that story the person is telling the other person to and at the very end you know it goes back to them telling the story if that's what a frame story is and this is one of the very first movies like to have that and believe it or not this is one of the very first movies to ever come out with the twist ending and a very good one too i did not expect that twist any coming and i guess i could say it's one of the greatest twist endings in cinema history but yeah this film is about a man named francis and um he's talking to this like guy next to him and then like this lady in white just like kind of walks past them like looking very weird i don't know and then um dr francis tells the man he's talked into he tells them a story about the cabinet of dr caligari or dr caligari and um basically what happens is um what's his name francis and alan are two they're kind of two friends who are both competing each other to marry a woman named jane james or can't talk right now jane is a woman that they're both planning on marrying but like you know they're gonna find out later on and um you know francis and now they're both friends they're both gonna be friends no matter what no matter who marries who but um basically the film takes place at this carnival where um there's a man in the name of dr caligari basically he's like running this big event thing where he's telling people to come be a son ambulance which we know as today as a sleepwalker and that's just what they called him back then but he's telling people to meet this sleepwalker who apparently is hypnotized and he's been awake for 23 years and that's how old he is and um this somnambulist his name is caesar or as they would pronounce it probably back then cesar and um cesar he's again he's like a sleepwalker he's been asleep all his life and um you know at this main event he's like a crowd of people alan and um allen and francis are one of those people and basically dr caligari keeps this man named cesar in a cabinet not let's not not necessarily a cabinet but like in this uh i want to see like kind of like a closet i guess i don't know where he keeps them he keeps him hidden that's the point but and then he opens it up and for the very first time cesar wakes up dr caligari does like this weird thing where he makes him wake up and he's woken up for the first time and um he says to ask he tells the audience to ask cesar all these different questions so um allen goes up to the sleepwalker and he tells him when will i die and basically cesar tells him you will die by tomorrow at dawn and at that point i was like this just got a little interesting and then you know what happens is it shows allen sleeping at night and then just like a shadowy figure slowly going up to him and killing him and stabbing him with the knife which is a very frightening scene by the way francis and jane get married the next day and um they soon find out that allen is uh murdered and um they find out that this dr caligari and this man named cesar are up to something that isn't very good and that they're killing random people in this town and that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much sums up the story of the cabinet of dr caligari now the cabinet of dr caligari is again a very very creepy movie um a lot better than i thought it was gonna be honestly i really really like this movie a lot and um yeah it really surprised me again that swiss standing was just fantastic i loved every second of this movie well some parts got a little slow here and there because you know it's a silent film and you know it's just it gets very slow but the movie is actually only 71 minutes long or at least the version i saw was 71 minutes long so it's definitely not very long you could easily like sit through the whole thing and watch it the film is very creepy what makes it creepy is like just there's no sound it's just all very eerie music and there's just the whole thing is just music playing and it's just so very eerie and it's kind of disturbing in a way that really makes the movie very good the movie has also this very strange and creepy atmosphere to it that not a lot of movies have nowadays and it's just very creepy i don't know why but for some reason the scene where um i don't know what to call them caesar or cesar i probably have been pronouncing it wrong this whole time i don't know but the part where he rakes up just really disturbs me for some reason i don't know why yeah guys this film is very very good please do watch it um i know some of you are not a fan of black and white movies or silent films but please whoever you are watch this film it really is a great movie a movie that all of us need to see i'm going to give the cabinet of dr caligari a four and a half pumpkins out of five again i really like this movie um i was really surprised about it and um go ahead and watch it i'm sure it's free on youtube or somewhere i don't know but just whatever it is go watch it it's a great film all right guys i'm jacob palacio thank you for watching this reviews stay tuned for my next review and i
