what a lovely movie what a lovely movie it was pretty good so I just,0.11336196
saw Mad Max fury road and whoa holy hell I'm still processing everything this film,0.36622652
had so much time surrounding it even when Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 98% then,0.17768277
I'm glad I'm reviewing this film the following day because at first I wasn't sure,0.07559226
how to feel about it I watched the first two Mad Max films I never,0.155485
got around to the third one but watching this modern-day take on it was so,0.09520801
kinetic so fast paced it was so different that I wasn't entirely sure how to,0.07349247
respond but after thinking about it yeah this film it's pretty sweet what everyone's saying,0.11020901
about this film is that it's an amazing action film some are saying that it's,0.07888349
one of the best of years some are saying it's one of the best of,0.050832186
all time some are even saying it is the best of all time some are,0.06389493
even saying God doesn't exist but this movie exists essentially this film was I got,0.13484628
90 minutes a two-hour car chase but it's done like Mad Max style meaning you,0.15081103
get the awesome production design to get the incredibly assembled vehicles you get insane Road,0.2775869
thrashing so serious like brutal deaths sometimes watching death in a movie is so cool,0.49635604
it's never cool in real life but sometimes you know like watching people get killed,0.7396454
you're sick you're you're all sick but the movie was greedy it was haunting it,0.81582737
was violent yeah it's like not grotesque that's actually something I greatly admire about this,0.20811465
film it like feels more disturbing and violent than it actually is showing you there's,0.22206935
really not much core in this film when there is gore it's like so fast-paced,0.07407605
that you don't even remember what it looked like I loved it because this whole,0.20718591
plot this whole story takes place in the middle of this adventure like the trailers,0.085569136
don't give away the plot for you so I don't want to ruin it for,0.19072092
you either like a short synopsis for me Charley's Theron is on the road to,0.35054517
somewhere where people are trying to stop her and she gets the help of Mad,0.2401681
Max and hence the chase ensues it's interesting because this movie is mainly but it,0.056663767
does take time for character in like little moments you learned about the characters like,0.06292063
throughout the adventure through how they're responding to this adventure without having like expositional dialogue,0.07019948
you see when I first walked out of this film I was like that dude,0.16663666
did it have much character but that's I thought about it more I realized that,0.04150494
it just didn't have like expositional dialogue George Miller not Frank Miller you say Frank,0.061998654
Miller a lot of people are gonna kill you trust me but George Miller has,0.6048274
this like wonderful ability to like come up with a story and it's like post-apocalyptic,0.12033736
world driven by the power of fuel and water resources rather than making his films,0.083015606
like a big exploration of this world he always focuses on the plot and he,0.071065724
only allows his characters to say what they would say in that moment of time,0.09618829
so it actually wouldn't make sense for these like strangers coming together during this really,0.08752223
high intense chase sequence to start giving a bunch of expositional dialogue but if you,0.095686235
pay attention to story and the characters all they're like this film has a pretty,0.08147214
strong theme about redemption they're about three main characters in this and it's really targeted,0.072347656
towards redemption and it's interesting because you actually understand more of the characters and how,0.061220992
they respond to the violence how they go about the violent moments and in between,0.18007779
George Miller really allows his actors to provide that depth without having to tell the,0.09972132
audience exactly everything about someone's past or what they're currently thinking Tom Hardy as Mad,0.2648389
Max Mel Gibson played the original max and that was a legendary character and I'm,0.05525569
so glad that Tom Hardy wasn't trying to be Mel Gibson's max Tom Hardy's backs,0.15055136
actually seems like you might be older he seems very haunted by the wasteland on,0.2748308
to by his mistakes from the past he's like actually going a little insane at,0.4564109
times she sort of reminds me from that weird creepy boy from the road warrior,0.31089434
because Tom Hardy's Max is sort of like an aggressive boy like he doesn't speak,0.4648086
much she doesn't there's a lot of grunting a lot of that like you could,0.1766825
tell he's a really violent threat but you can still so see that he has,0.24162172
a heart but similar to how I sort of perceived a road warrior Max is,0.036251448
sort of used more as a character device to support the bigger picture of other,0.03940793
characters like Charlize Theron character the trailers didn't reveal who she really was so I'm,0.08033864
not going to she's fantastic in this film she's someone who's also haunted by the,0.15189053
demons of her past and some present-day mistakes too she's a warrior a protector just,0.22685058
like that Charlize Theron would be to me in real life if my girlfriend shaved,0.4442927
her head like Charlize Theron we would have serious relationship issues that would not be,0.2773967
okay with that she only has one hand the other is mechanical if I have,0.122829705
a mechanical hand you know what I use that for I don't know where these,0.13985865
jokes are coming from but she kicked some serious ass in this film this film,0.90175605
actually has a lot of badass females you got young badass females middle-aged badass females,0.6049634
and even elderly badass females it's like the fine brothers show except with kicking ass,0.9185949
instead of reacting with Charlize Theron I really bought her as his character you know,0.103993304
to see Charlize Theron on-screen I were usually like it's Charlize Theron she's really beautiful,0.14953378
and yeah she's a great actress but I'm still aware as you saw at least,0.15089227
there and I really liked how she went all out with this she was not,0.17407306
the most attractive in this film but her ability to like transform into this badass,0.46179533
one-handed lady was dope but the true scene stealer for me was Nicholas Hoult like,0.44823405
I keep saying I'm not gonna give much away they don't say whose characters in,0.0542136
the trailer but Nicholas Hoult performance man that's the one you're gonna walk away thinking,0.14720453
about like a plum introduction he seems like oh okay he's just another crazy Mad,0.6051848
Max villain with each scene he gets they give him more and more to do,0.23497964
and you explored him actually more than you would even explore max of this film,0.16448912
the film was great too for doubt the character's name don't know the actor's name,0.057587285
but I like the villains motives in this film it was different from the other,0.100096524
villains that's that's actually what I like about this whole franchise the first Mad Max,0.19019476
the gangsters are like serial killers on wheels the road warrior had villains that were,0.47924337
like tribal territorial savages in a way this one is more like a cult it's,0.4763566
like a civilization ruled by evil religious thinking so I like how the characters are,0.48598734
always like crazy but they always have a different type of thing about them the,0.361722
music of this film is wonderful it really does get your heart going I love,0.08808768
the editing of this film I love like the man craziness the kinetic energy that,0.2338085
just the camera angles and the editing bring to the film I'll be honest I,0.06512886
strongly do prefer the first half over the last half that's not to say the,0.07213726
last half is bad it's just the last half had like one or two small,0.179092
moments that seemed to drag a little bit and the actions started seeming a little,0.06942228
repetitive but then again there's just so much action that I don't even know actually,0.078540824
if it was repetitive it might have been different it's just so much in your,0.1187355
face that you know it's like what was that different than what I saw so,0.10225655
yeah if you don't walk away thinking about the characters necessarily you will not forget,0.108606905
the action in this film it's so cool because it's from the same writer director,0.08735388
of the original Mad Max but he like really updated it like he's been paying,0.14250098
attention to films over the last 30 years and I feel like in a lot,0.065884806
of ways this has some of the best moments of the entire franchise because those,0.07774362
action scenes are like cleverly choreographed at what school is that yes there's some CGI,0.12349557
here and there but it's mainly practical effects and like crazy stuntmen and at the,0.2509923
end of the day it has just enough character to provide the emotional depth to,0.05089997
support the action scenes let me get straight to the point here all in all,0.13097152
