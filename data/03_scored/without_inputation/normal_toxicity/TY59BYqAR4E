it's so good to have you back Pixar yay look at him smiling he's so happy,0.09511236
yeah,0.040847696
I guess but he's gonna be really sad,0.09566446
when he finds out there's gonna be a cars three times,0.049490422
three like OMG gross chorus three but I hate the second one hey guys the by credit guy,0.41221806
and I'm here today to review the latest Disney Pixar film inside out so inside out Paul's joy sadness fear if disgust and who all control the emotions of a little girl named Riley who's moving from Minnesota to San Francisco and one day while Riley is introducing herself to her new classmates sadness creates her first ever sad core memory which joy does not like one bit joy,0.18709484
tries to stop it from becoming a core memory,0.1022877
but in the process causes all the joyful core memories to fall out which in turn gets her self sadness and those core memories sucked into a tube and sent to the long-term memory section of Riley's mind,0.16487388
so now joy and sadness must find their way back to headquarters returned the core memories and get Riley's emotions in check now it's been nearly two years since the last Pixar film and five years since the last great and memorable one and when they announced that they weren't gonna be releasing a film in 2014 in order to restructure their company it got a lot of people wondering what's next for Pixar have they run out of new ideas are they just gonna resort to prequels and sequels or they're gonna try to reinvigorate themselves and come up with new concepts and ideas,0.05581095
what would be the fate of Pixar,0.15281975
so when they announced that their next film was going to be an original story called inside out I'm not gonna deny it I thought that sound like a very intriguing concept and it just had so much promise to it not only did have a star-studded cast but it also was being directed and co-written by Pete docter one of the heads of Pixar Animation Studios and without a doubt the funniest director they have there with such hits as Monsters Inc and the very touching up and with all those elements put together,0.10899634
what you got is a winning combination in a return to form for Pixar,0.11094297
now for those of you who actually sat through the entirety of my top 10 favorite Pixar films sorry for the length not only do I applaud you but you might also recall that I said in that video that Monsters Inc was without a doubt the funniest Pixar film I've ever seen right we'll move over monsters Inc because there's a new sheriff in town and that is inside out inside out has,0.24496114
now replaced monsters Inc as the funniest Pixar film I have ever seen,0.31089434
and it's so coincidental because it's from the same guy that made monsters,0.58944625
inc this film had my best friend Steven and I in stitches we were laughing hysterically throughout we almost teared up and how funny these scenes were and there were a lot of clever and witty jokes throughout the film there's this one joke in particular that is without a doubt the most clever joke,0.11622337
I ever heard in a film and not to give away the punch line of the joke but it has to do with deja vu that joke was just a stroke of genius with most of that hilarity being attributed to the characters in the film particularly the five emotions just the way they would react to the everyday situations that Riley would get into and the interactions among themselves priceless pure comedic gold,0.07336299
and speaking of gold whoever was the casting director for this film they did a perfect job at picking who should voice the five emotions,0.07757102
I mean seriously any boy is joy perfect,0.116928674
Phyllis from the office has sadness perfect Mindy,0.08690696
calling has disgust perfect Lewis,0.30053684
Black has anger holy crap give that person,0.78517026
a raise that is without doubt the best call anybody could make for anger,0.14923514
and he was just enjoying every second of it and every Louis black is immune Emerson it just was missing a rat,0.64555305
that's all I was missing the only emotion that I was kind of so-so about was Bill Hader as fear not to say that he didn't do a great job,0.080804445
he did a fantastic job,0.09503406
it's just I felt like he wasn't really the person that I would say yeah he personifies fear I never really see that I could see somebody else doing it,0.19434816
but again he did really good,0.05224942
he did a solid job as fear,0.16671114
and I really enjoyed the pairing of joy sadness,0.066452876
complete opposites having to work together get back to headquarters,0.09472961
it freakin writes itself but they actually do end up growing a rather strong bond through this experience with joy really growing as a character,0.4291872
and realizing that joy cannot be the only emotion that this girl has to feel they all have to work together as a team,0.1864288
so that she has a great mix of emotions now the concept and story the concept itself is intriguing really unique and overall creative something that has been missing from Pixar in the last five years and I'm just so glad that it's finally back the idea of these emotions personified in your mind that regulate your emotional output is just a refreshing idea,0.08553671
and the story is not just solid but extremely relatable especially for people particularly kids who have to move from place to place because their parents jobs demanded of them and have to leave behind everything they knew and love ask anybody who's ever gone through this,0.09590949
and they'll tell you that it is such an emotional experience to have to leave behind everything,0.1634884
you knew love and have to get acclimated to a new area,0.18786074
I have went through that many at times and I really related to Riley's dilemma in the film and one of the final most emotional scenes in the film really resonated with me as it was something that I also experienced and finally the animation Wow I went in Reverse with this review,0.027891198
but the animation once again is solid but it's Pixar you kind of come to expect that,0.10093215
but I really like the look and design of the emotions they are just on freaking planet they look,0.5224105
so freakin fuzzy as if they were designed to become toys not so some of their Pixar not so simple Who am I kidding I'm probably gonna buy them all anyway now though my experience with this film is mostly positive,0.44077906
I do have a few slight issues with the film the first one is the pacing of the film was a bit slow in some places,0.07936031
particularly the long term memory sections,0.13118434
I mean it just felt like it would drag on for free and ever and ever which makes sense there in the long-term memory which is like this huge maze like place,0.14568532
but it also ended up becoming really repetitive with them being so close yet so far were being so close and it's just so far policy the biggest fault,0.12999928
I found with this movie was with this character Bing bong,0.08014277
now keep in mind,0.07232977
I'm not saying that,0.07942246
he's a terrible character as I said this character seemed like he would work better in small doses like if he was in the film for about five to ten minutes and then went on his merry way that would have been perfect,0.37281016
but this character overstays his welcome and stays with the group for most of the journey and as the film went on the character went from being whimsical innocent and playful to just overbearing and annoying like we just have to keep dealing with this character leave him already but to be fair to the character,0.08536256
he does have some really good emotional scenes in the film but they would have had a bigger impact had he not lingered around for so long but you know what even with those small issues,0.07930257
this is a great film and a true return to form for Pixar animation studio and I'm just so glad that they're back and I'm glad that they chose this film to be their comeback film because I'm gonna give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars I think that it is one hell of film a great family film,0.081732355
you guys gotta go check it out and support Pixar,0.15501684
but anyway what did you guys think of this film,0.14975202
