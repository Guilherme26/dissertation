unofficial retirement and also a uniting the two legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino,0.020208348
for only the fourth time ever on screen all this definitely makes the Irishman one,0.07410024
of the biggest events in film dis year it's also the first time ever that,0.06302814
Scorsese worked with Al Pacino and also the Joe Pesci M Pacino I in a,0.06129481
movie together and if you haven't guessed it by now it surely delivers on all,0.07800194
the high price had already received it's pretty damn fantastic it has the story of,0.32140166

recalling the events of his life and in particular his connection to the union leader,0.064898446
Jimmy Hoffa played by Al Pacino the characters and the events of the Irishman are,0.027592357
all pretty much based on real people and their stories and involvement in American history,0.07998632
to what degree the film sticks to the truth can be debated and is getting,0.081656106
debated the screenplay was written by Steven Zaillian who has won an Oscar for screenplay,0.06927681
for Schindler's List and it is based on a 2004 book I heard you paint,0.07394936
houses but a former homicide prosecutor investigator and defense attorney Charles brand which chronicles the,0.057042435
life of Frank Dee Irishman Sheeran there has been disputes and counter articles to the,0.084981024
book which I don't really want to go into that much here I think for,0.10398517
the movie it's only important that you know that it tells a story that might,0.062259216
have happened this way or in a similar fashion but of course it's also told,0.03133174
through the lens of a poignant horror movie it's an epic crime film and in,0.14279969
the vein of most of Scorsese's films it's a drama that's also highly entertaining and,0.15240763
really funny at times with the running time of three and a half hours its,0.056344617
consensus longest film and I was a little bit afraid that it might turn out,0.15097472
kind of episodic because it is primarily distributed on Netflix and they might have unofficially,0.07918419
divided it in smaller parts so it's easier to watch for an hour and continue,0.10038532
the next day but in my very positive surprise the Irishman definitely feels like a,0.095778525
complete picture and as someone who's a big fan of tight movies that don't waste,0.26189166
a lot of screen time I was also surprised that I pretty much cherished every,0.045622144
minute of it I think you could possibly cut it down a little bit and,0.4815653
just left off some of the shown events but I also think that it all,0.04657426
adds to the feeling of a long travel and recollection of a man's life that,0.10725044
is unfolding in front of our eyes like I said I watched it on the,0.07629806
big screen the house was packed and the is rather narrow I guess for the,0.06549601
last hour so I kind of had to go to the bathroom but because I,0.10152427
didn't want to disturb anyone and also because the movie was dead captivating I just,0.10204918
didn't go and I really didn't mind that much because I was really glued to,0.05000026
the screen Martin Scorsese with almost 80 years old is still a filmmaker full of,0.06226254
energy full of passion full of wit and drive and he Irishman's 209 minutes a,0.22723217
packed with amazing scenes and it's not just the best off of his previous gangster,0.35911325
movies it's its own thing of course it revisits familiar but away it taketh its,0.08178256
story and also the way this whole project is coming together on a meta level,0.050442852
with the Niro Pacino and Pesci United and also portraying their characters at different ages,0.056425005
over the course of a lifetime and three and a half hours of movie time,0.06401017
is simply remarkable and in the hands of such a brilliant filmmaker this can set,0.037612233
you in a stage of absolute bliss the film is moving on three different timelines,0.0679087
which it is constantly and effortlessly jumping back and forth to in typical Scorsese fashion,0.06947971
we get one of those super long continuous takes but this time not through a,0.08087787
casino but through the hallways of a nursing home where the old aged Frank Sheeran,0.070240214
is sitting in a wheelchair and recollects the events of his life to the audience,0.20645861
we also have the younger but still very old Frank who is taking a road,0.09640149
trip to Detroit with his friend Russel played by Joe Pesci they are on their,0.09142383
way to a wedding and we know that there will be another very important event,0.034401033
happening at their destination then we have the third and I would say main timeline,0.076586634
which chronicles Frank's life in the Mafia this timeline sets in sometime in the 1950s,0.09933076
and then progresses through the years until we end up at the road trip and,0.061751004
then even later at him being in that nursing home there's another jump back in,0.09096026
time to Frank's time in the war but that's just a very small scene now,0.103132315
let's talk about a negative the Irishman is already very famous for its extensive use,0.15513444
of digital DEA agent technology or Uthoff occasion we see all three main characters as,0.045138445
well as many side characters at different stages of their lives but instead of casting,0.06670058
other younger actors it's really the Niro Pacino and Pesci who are playing the parts,0.14959237
with their faces digitally changed to look younger the first time we cut to the,0.18910581
Nero's Frank as a young man in his late 30s or early 40s I guess,0.07961469
is really off-putting I assume you've all seen the trailers for the Irishman and you,0.09095539
probably noticed the effect as well unfortunately it doesn't look better in the finished film,0.13836746
oftentimes it's not that easy not to think of the Nero's characters some kind of,0.071861856
video game character I think what makes it worse as the fact that they gave,0.15150145
him blue eyes because the real Frank had blue eyes of course it has always,0.095491044
been a common practice to change someone's iCal on screen by wearing contacts or by,0.15527026
digital effects but all the de-aging combined with those striking blue eyes of Frank it,0.10090563
felt really weird and your brain just instantly knows that this isn't right and as,0.5154597
a consequence I had a rather hard time for a very long time to fully,0.08614417
investigate into the Niro's character because it wasn't easy to even accept him as a,0.084085025
real person fortunately though the effect somehow works much better for Pacino and Pesci it's,0.08860123
also noticeable in certain moments but somehow they seem to be much closer to reality,0.08476173
and not in that uncanny valley De Niro's character ISM but I can also assure,0.07354913
you that the film is strong enough and that you get used to it maybe,0.07007387
because your brain just gives up at some point and accepts it so it's really,0.53565234
not a deal-breaker at all in the end and it also gets better as the,0.064477965
movie progresses because the depicted time period is allowing the Niro to get closer and,0.04093598
closer to his real age which means that by the time you should be invested,0.07874875
most into the story it's also the time he looks the most natural and even,0.07019592
though the nura look sweet in many scenes the whole first hour so well as,0.070467226
well as the rest of the film holds so many wonderful gangster scenes that reminded,0.13777323
me so much about my love for the grand theft auto video game series the,0.073336415
title of the book the movies based on is I hurt you paint houses and,0.07807807
this can actually be considered the unofficial title of the irishman as well because the,0.07646682
title the irishman only appears on screen at the very end but at the beginning,0.18927811
it's I hurt you paint houses in big white letters on black only that Frank's,0.4949019
painting houses with the blood of the people he is supposed to eliminate there are,0.32319266
so many little and bigger gangster scenes and the way the film portrays it's different,0.31089434
time periods is handled with such an eye for detail like I said it's a,0.06825041
pure joy and this is a movie that stuffed with great characters and great actors,0.08135301
from Harvey Keitel to Ray Romano everybody shines and what a gift it is that,0.051349286
we got back Pesce to portray the gangster boss Russell Bufalino this is a true,0.19157149
master performance unfolding on-screen and unlike other Pesci roads we have seen normally you would,0.079365484
expect him to play someone explosive unpredictable and overtly violent and yes there is a,0.21332842
glimpse of what Russell has done in the past but mostly it's him overseeing his,0.07299995
men and I was really surprised what kind of warmth this character was losing Pesci,0.19538891
brings so much gravitas to the film and it makes you understand how Frank was,0.029061241
drawn to him and this lifestyle but the one who is killing it the most,0.40338898
is Al Pacino he plays the union leader Jimmy Hoffa and it takes some time,0.07694669
and here we are being introduced to him this marks the first time Scorsese work,0.08913642
with Pacino and what an energy he is bringing to the table be prepared for,0.056979362
that Pacino rage the screaming the cursing the intimidation but also for a fully fleshed,0.49101982
out character who becomes the central point of conflict throughout the story in the hands,0.07154974
of the right people you simply get this special kind of movie magic and to,0.1553835
see the friendship between Frank and Jimmy form and where it goes is mesmerizing and,0.055486336
the West Coast says he directs his actors and how the scenes are unfolding is,0.08441927
so great these characters have so much personality and just to watch them talk with,0.06373524
one another is amazing and the Irishman always succeeds on both fields creating this highly,0.084316574
entertaining fun gangster film full of great dialogues about coming to lay two meetings what,0.19182612
kind of clothes to wear and the beauty of saddle or not so subtle meanings,0.08635532
behind specific words and then on the other side is since see a human drama,0.14961953
and distance deconstruction of this gangster lifestyle this is what Scorsese can do so well,0.35513288
and there are times where the Irishman can be the greatest romp and then there,0.11175426
are times where it's really mature and revealing how empty these lives truly are for,0.1489543
a long time I wasn't so sure who this Frank Sheeran actually is what are,0.08948682
his goals his real ambitions what is he seeking in life the film takes us,0.09322582
on a journey and we are always with him yet he stays kind of and,0.051782448
big years maybe it needs to repeat watches but maybe this is also kind of,0.068074025
the point we never really get to know him that closely I think a very,0.07434031
important aspect of the film is his relationship to one of his four daughters from,0.06289837
a very early age on his Peggy was always troubled by his obvious links to,0.11269911
the underworld and what her father is capable of doing and their relationship gets only,0.15653452
more difficult in time for some time I thought to myself that we really don't,0.0595607
know anything about her character and that she's just another female character who seems to,0.31089434
be very underwritten but I think again that that's exactly the point the whole film,0.06313188
is told through Frank's perspective and not really to get to know that much about,0.035494022
his daughter is only logical because it underlines that he was never really able to,0.24111734
create a meaningful bond with her his way of life was always in the way,0.08760151
and then for the film won't give us and won't give him the pleasure of,0.057131402
really getting to know her I really think that the Irishman is a remarkable film,0.08463692
and there's of course a lot more that I could talk about from the music,0.055469565
to the camera and editing from the period settings to the emotional finale to the,0.07978948
way the food portrays eating it's a super rich film that deserves your attention I,0.2925635
will watch it a second time for sure when it's out on Netflix and again,0.0681371
