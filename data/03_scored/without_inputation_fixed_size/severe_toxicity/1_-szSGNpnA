a above right now go back and watch those trailer review trailer reactions because I,0.08052846
talked a lot about it but my gosh she was better than I ever thought,0.08368542
she could be I never thought she would have that inner and and I mean,0.08143378
that was the most respect she was amazing she was Wonder Woman oh my gosh,0.075944684
the ladies and gentlemen the story was done so well guys you guys are let,0.0314113
me break this down watching gal on the island of the mascara was dope the,0.121066086
costumes won't point guys I really felt like I was there watching the sisters the,0.046981256
Amazon warriors care for that woman that girl that little that little baby was amazing,0.23522152
I love the fact that we got a chance to see the the the Amazons,0.038740296
and there were all different different cultures you know I mean they were all one,0.055899374
they were also super they're all different cultures I love the costume design I love,0.038565353
how they had like the black the sisters the black ones and their hair they,0.26645678
didn't they didn't they didn't look fake you know I mean they didn't look fake,0.09473812
at all I didn't they look authentic they had the thick hair but they put,0.042209227
it back till they combed it it was perfect I loved every bit of it,0.267845
dope gal though stood out like a sore thumb and I mean in a good,0.20015909
way when she spoke there at home that accident works that accident I never was,0.05375482
against accident now oh I love the fact when when when they stay true to,0.0407405
the character in that form that accent worked because it made her even more exotic,0.027645698
watching you you felt she was authentic she'll authentic Amazon and I loved every bit,0.07090924
of it she did her thing with that she truly from beginning from seeing her,0.036952946
from the beginning she truly made me believe that she's one a woman I believe,0.061240133
she was wondering when I was about to be Superman but when I got a,0.031491123
chance to see the origin of her I was like oh my god she's really,0.047685686
Wonder Woman because she stood for everything one of them instead for and it's not,0.06429532
just power just as in truth autocrat like that it's the woman she was young,0.049140442
but she was a sister she was a hunt she was a cousin she was,0.11014178
a grand mom she she was all the women in the world and you can,0.23880534
fill it off of her she was perfect perfect when she met Chris Pines Steve,0.11280916
Trevor it was I I kid you not guys it was magic it was magic,0.121872954
watching those two on screen together they had a great chemistry this movie has a,0.028690036
lot of good chemistry those two it was like I kid you not it was,0.03502591
like watching them from just watching this like watching this show and you see them,0.03443589
and it shows on for ten years and you watch them grow and have kids,0.062545225
in the family that's how it was that chemistry was perfect it was it was,0.03355652
innocent it was sweet it was funny it was caring it was sad it was,0.05321469
every emotion you can have and you can see him this has to be Chris,0.02059209
Pines probably the best role he's ever done because you can see the acting chops,0.021251287
he has I see two actors she's actor to actor is an actor that elevated,0.11093534
their skills to the max in this film and my gosh it worked I felt,0.0754571
like those two knew that they're going to show up the world and they both,0.017428476
on the same page with it and it worked that chemistry between those two was,0.0144497845
beautiful I loved every bit of it guys I mean it was so sweet watching,0.10920919
them it was dope was the same it was it was it was three scenes,0.06963608
that I will never forget and I loved I have to say a little bit,0.09324012
something it was a scene you guys see when they're not when when they showed,0.056558568
them in like a like a water room or something like that like a little,0.07480123
cave or something was probably one of the funniest things that I ever experienced in,0.03723964
a superhero I loved every bit of it because it wasn't necessarily meant to be,0.03648998
funny it was logical and it was dope at the same time because it was,0.05858738
real the movie felt real it felt real it was vibrant it felt real it,0.030619733
didn't feel like a comic-book movie it felt like it felt like a a Greek,0.08102136
mythology story that actually really happened it felt like a biblical story that actually happened,0.011912774
it worked guys my gosh it worked those two on camera magic shout out the,0.07888812
GAO shout-out to Chris Pine doing your thing that right there it's gonna be hard,0.0628552
to replicate that I've never seen that in a superhero movie never never beautiful beautiful,0.058315985
moments right there with them - oh my gosh I can't wait to talk about,0.06132461
him huh that was tight next the directing guys the directing oh my gosh this,0.15594766
uh you remember this the music the story chemistry the actors the actors and actors,0.026894705
chemistry the chemistry mixed with the story and the music this was a beautiful web,0.03149312
going on right now let's get into the director of the movie miss patty Jenkins,0.08022115
patty Jenkins outdid herself in this movie I remember we went back we went back,0.050344422
we go back let's go back a couple months right and I went to WonderCon,0.024200711
with my boys you know Judy Joe Savin Jackson you know ap5 we was there,0.032369167
it was a couple other people who didn't show up but we went we got,0.025811786
a chance to watch patty Jenkins and a couple of scenes of Wonder Woman I,0.08403598
was when I are your life when I saw that I was sold on the,0.06822057
movie when I saw a scene I was like oh my gosh this is tight,0.059060324
she explained what she was trying to do what she wanted to do with the,0.03218092
film she says she wanted to make a Richard Donner film she wanted to go,0.05332977
Casablanca and I see the Casablancas vibe with those two characters bad Wonder Woman and,0.13571543
Steve Trevor I see it I see it oh man I see it is there,0.021860596
she went that Lois and Clark bye I telling you guys is there it's beautiful,0.030119516
love right there so sorry so but when I got a chance to watch it,0.03741658
this woman I is amazing she knows how to capture the right scene at the,0.18989396
right time it's amazing guys from seeing the mascara the beautiful landscape watching the the,0.057316214
costume of the the Amazons and their costumes and looking so authentic such a beautiful,0.036997516
vibe the whole time watching young Diana as the issue is forget her name her,0.04610787
name is Emily something I can't remember but she played young Princess Diana she was,0.02970311
beautiful she's a little girl and she's a thorn her thing you could see the,0.21138074
the curiosity in her head you can see she wanted to be something greater for,0.044718966
someone to capture stuff like that that's amazing guys this project is that her thing,0.049080577
in this movie she directed so many scenes and they were all amazing I didn't,0.049026694
know she knew how to direct action guys I didn't know I was shocked the,0.039204594
action scenes in this movie are are on point I'm gonna be honest machine the,0.030944344
action seems to me personally and this is not being biased or anything the action,0.031556312
seems just basically say this take Winter Soldier right take Winter Soldier before Bucky takes,0.03319732
his mask off all that before Bucky takes his mask off take Winter Soldier and,0.13497041
then add it in with Man of Steel that's what you get you get a,0.017569495
complete believable facing because you know she's Wonder Woman so she gonna do things some,0.13341255
some things like Superman but the the the the choreography of the fight scenes are,0.027940374
like Winter Soldier so it works it works in the time frame it is dope,0.14305772
the actions she did her thing on those actions things the action scenes are on,0.028578285
point that right there was the shocker for me because before before I see what,0.03643344
I saw at WonderCon I was always worried about okay well she got a fight,0.06315453
how's she gonna get down you know I mean I know gal has a background,0.09636915
in military uh she was in a military so she has a background of that,0.0373188
military training all that stuff like that so I was like okay how they gonna,0.17169787
use her how are you gonna use her and they use their well she was,0.024770774
on point Wonder Woman action scenes were my god why I can't believe I'm gonna,0.061434366
say this this is real true spit was better than bad be Superman it was,0.11198566
better than the Batman warehouse scene it was better than that and let me explain,0.036567807
the reason why it was better than that is because it was God doing most,0.050713602
of that on some note some notes and then explained that the warehouse scene was,0.026191605
planned Batman planned that he knew I mean people was in a room he knew,0.062740125
this Wonder Woman was a warrior y'all she didn't count how many people on the,0.055907354
field didn't why didn't she just wait and served them all up that's why it,0.067089096
gets the edge of a Batman's fight scene for me because she went in there,0.06357426
with her eyes closed she was blindfolded and she handled business that's why she gets,0.038795505
the edge over the Batman V Superman fight scene now personally got all the Batman,0.039062243
scene I want the Fighting's I've seen when her soldier and that Batman warehouse was,0.026702467
on point no for real but wonder woman gets the cake on that y'all she,0.12070023
gets that that that fight scene was tight guys I was in the audience and,0.12649332
some stuff happened and I can I was tight and everybody's looking at me they,0.04537284
was looking at me I was like what you looking at that was trying I,0.030677605
was excited when I saw that man I was excited when I saw that that,0.03707534
was dope way anyway moving on actually sings on point hey Jenkins director dope that,0.17685837
was that was amazing I shocked shocked by how well this film was put together,0.02906786
in the chemistry base and it makes sense the director held his movie together but,0.010110126
casting didn't let nobody stop they helped they held it I felt like they held,0.055999815
each other together Chris was like you know God I know people hating on you,0.22939235
and I'm gonna help you out and she was like thank you and I'm gonna,0.081930004
make sure that what you do for me ain't gonna do it is it's like,0.04179149
that's how I felt like they were I felt like and I don't know if,0.037801057
this is true but I really felt like he was like a real friend to,0.05684327
her it was like look I know us a lot of haters out there but,0.14536059
we gonna make sure we give a hundred and thirty-five percent and you can feel,0.03983253
it you can see the way they looked at each other it was like a,0.035080455
real true friendship and they held each other together throughout this film with the support,0.015063749
of director and the story and the music shouts to Geoff Johns and the music,0.008328765
it was a great triangle guys it really worked this movie was tight I love,0.1516765
this movie guys this was a great film enjoyed it I can't wait to purchase,0.09989196
it I can't wait to watch it again I know personally I'm gonna watch this,0.058151018
movie at least ten times in theaters guys I ignore him because I'm a Dark,0.0471409

film is dope guys please go watch this movie we need these type of movies,0.21471396
to grow because if they grow now Warner Brothers knows that's for real they need,0.023107816
to know this is how you make a movie because this gives other movies hope,0.033439446
the hope that we need the the the the spirit of the comic book world,0.051249076
for real keeping the 100 now a lot of people were saying that oh let,0.027325079
me get your great before I do that I give Wonder Woman that's what I,0.1275636
give this movie this is the best superhero origin film of all time as of,0.053108927
