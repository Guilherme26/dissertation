main issue facing these characters which I thought was very effective in keeping the tension,0.050160833
constantly high the plot keeps us focused on the specific family you just enough substance,0.027927736
to really understand the ramifications of all the threats that they face but there were,0.113852836
some nicely placed tidbits that captured the fact that there is a world going on,0.030213306
around them and I thought it was a nice added element of mystery the storyline,0.047064405
keeps a swift pace it has a great overall focus it spends the right amount,0.05013223

the two of those which leads us into the character performances which I thought were,0.01133739
all very good Krasinski and blunt shared a strong believable chemistry with one another they,0.037003502
really had to rely on a lot of physical acting to capture emotions and moods,0.022124007

this film you really care about these characters through their performances and it makes those,0.0633155
more intense moments hit that much harder and the performances from the younger cast members,0.038889296

a film but over the past handful of years there really has been a strong,0.017309409
uptick in the quality of younger performers and this film was no different with noah,0.0281978
Joop and Millicent Simmons both bringing some very natural performances to this storyline now let's,0.042420093
talk direction and cinematography to more strong aspects for this film the direction was simple,0.023682533
but I really thought it was effective in capturing all the implied tones the settings,0.022024231
and backdrops were all perfectly selected for this plotline it felt very isolated and imposing,0.038264688
and with a nice use of lighting and camera angles you really can feel the,0.030904433
ominous routine of their lives and the intensity from that constant threat of attack I,0.29030457
thought the camerawork also used nice angles and very nicely times slow pans to build,0.06690683
suspense instead of using cheap jump scares which was fantastic this movie also utilized sound,0.087309346
or lack of it very nicely there were some long bouts of silence and when,0.049753077
it would implement sounds from either the musical score or from nature or sound effects,0.02925145
or some of the minimal bouts of dialogue it really would stand out there was,0.030780708
also some moments where the musical score really did a great job of amplifying the,0.028115982
moves of specific scenes very effectively and overall for a film that relied on his,0.02862751
characters to make no noise it really did use sound to its advantage so overall,0.032046553
