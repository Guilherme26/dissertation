hello I'm Christine and Avengers endgame has happened and game is out I've seen it,0.06538919
it's happened you've probably seen it I'm gonna start this off with my spoiler for,0.15228157
your view but then I'm gonna go into my five favorite moment my punch that,0.3817718
made me emotional like Parts I had little issues with all sorts and categories that,0.10117082
are spoilery so just beware get ready for the warning but overall thoughts I mean,0.19173987
what a feat these last 10 years have been for Marvel no matter what they,0.122845635
did it was gonna be really hard to wrap this up in a way that,0.06411738
made everyone happy but I think they wrap this up in a way that made,0.057407346
everyone happy I did like I said I had some issues that kind of nip,0.27040324
at me but I enjoyed the hell out of myself there are so many fantastic,0.37817633
moments I loved it and I can't wait to see it again and was it,0.090618685
as good as infinity war in my opinion No infinity war to me is perfection,0.24052228
but this is much harder than the first half of the end because the first,0.07428845
half of the end isn't the end and the end has to be satisfying in,0.08676946
so many different ways there's a lot to tie up and I think they did,0.05486937
a really great job with it there was bound to be a little fraying along,0.06816964
the edges because there's so many characters so overall I'm gonna give endgame a 90%,0.06811747
I think I gave infinity or a 98 or 100 it's still an a it's,0.059365764
just not an A plus plus plus plus spoilers are coming goodbye non-spoilery people okay,0.15173745
so I had to organize this video because there's way too much going on and,0.07827943
I definitely have more than five of each of these categories but I had to,0.082007326
narrow it down or this would be a three hour long video I thinks the,0.15540677
rider said that was genius Sun Linsanity war review I talked about how they can't,0.16145433
just bring everyone back you know we can't just use the time stone rewind and,0.06471487
poof everyone back in this movie but in a way it felt like some sort,0.2974923
of time travel was inevitable right here's a time soon but the way the writers,0.065731145
did it was beautifully biggest genius move that they made was coming us off from,0.08652675
the very beginning so will we start immediately they go after Thanos immediately we realized,0.24650964
the stones are gone poop they're gone he destroyed them so there's no stones and,0.49083906
we killed him Thanos is dead within the first 20 minutes the movie we're all,0.6650073
kind of thrown off kilter a bit like I thought that was gonna be more,0.24234046
difficult but already all our theories about getting the stones back from him are gone,0.10909257
there are no stones what do we do now and the second genius part of,0.10119754
that right there is five years later those five years made all the emotional loss,0.06971886
we felt from all those moments and infinity work pay off because there was no,0.07018217
proof they're back they had five years they had to live in this world without,0.11850241
them for five years the world had to keep going and that changes the ballgame,0.11285678
I don't know why I just made a sports reference our characters have to deal,0.035505734
with so much nlgger and have to evolve and become new versions of themselves gave,0.31089434
our character so much more of an emotional punch when it came time to get,0.15031262
the stones back three I was worried about Captain Marvel going to this movie after,0.09992805
seeing half to Marvel I'd feel like Captain Marvel is the son and Kartik how,0.1814961
is there gonna be any struggle in this movie you know I think it was,0.110023975
such a smart decision to have her all universe helping other planets our heroes needed,0.051752843
to try to fix this nlgger themselves whilst I don't really know why they didn't,0.34874403
ping her about they're going back in time play and they just you know what,0.045435455
I've had with it without her I still think it was better without having her,0.28205
there because everything would have been too easy she's such a force that you don't,0.14964128
get the same fight you know there isn't that struggle in that fear that maybe,0.06665644
we won't wait at the end when she was fighting Thanos there was still a,0.051432766
fight you know there was still struggle and I loved seeing that I loved watching,0.18524632
her have a hard time there but I still don't fully understand the limits of,0.133977
her power and I don't think we as a whole do because we've only seen,0.13392457
her in such a limited period of time and unlimited scenarios with her power thus,0.16021971
far and nlgger Tony Stark's character arc it's no secret that Ironman is my favorite,0.18566164
Avenger if you didn't know Ironman is my favorite Avenger he has been since the,0.06963028
very first Iron Man movie and his emotional art has been so beautiful I loved,0.14867248
seeing him and pepper settle down and have a kid I loved watching him interact,0.25788635
with his Caleb - that conversation he had with his father he's come so far,0.12964725
from that first movie the first time he talks to Captain America he's like you're,0.15474324
not the one to make that sacrifice play and then he does he makes that,0.07633099
cyber heist play for New York at the end of Avengers and then he makes,0.25219247
the biggest sacrifice you know he sacrifices himself for everyone for everyone in the universe,0.4394854
this piece of fan art says that all y'all top five favorite moments gotta start,0.07863928
with the best moment of the entire film oh my god I think everyone across,0.051487103
the land lived their shits this elation just flown through me and exploded out my,0.8606264
mouth when Thor's hammer rose off the ground in two caps awaiting had I couldn't,0.15052317
even contain myself he's just a magical moment at comedy and age of Ultron paid,0.19476901
off tenfold in this moment oh my god I will never forget this collective ten,0.115461856
seconds in the theater well we were all just losing it together they were like,0.08690694
two eight-year-old kids next to me and after like I screamed and whooped I'm pretty,0.36203045
sure I was just like next favorite moment is another cat moment this movie I,0.06690951
finally came around to cap the moment in the elevator when he gets in the,0.062860414
elevator in there back in time it's such a throwback to Winter Soldier and we're,0.07918733
all just immediately excited like they're doing it they're doing the Winter Soldier thing we're,0.06645887
all expecting a fight to break out he just leans over and goes it's okay,0.29971245
hail Hydra oh my god what excellent three the moment we seem pepper fly up,0.16750939
in the Iron Man suit my heart the tears the happiness coursing through my veins,0.13806456
just shot through the roof it was just so wonderful and rewarding to see her,0.46527895
there fighting for their world with everyone else mm-hmm for that moment when Captain Marvel,0.12693483
has hold of the gauntlet vitamins like I don't know how you're gonna throw that,0.24238928
alone and all the women show up behind her and they're like she won't be,0.29992622
alone and they just keep coming all them just keeps showing up in the Wasson,0.24026401
the Valkyrie it was just such a beautiful moment it was kind of a callback,0.08880683
to the moment where Scarlet Witch is about to be killed by one of fan,0.6572808
doses children in infinity war and they go you're gonna die alone and like when,0.79702944
I was like she's not alone and Michonne is there fives a moment where scarlet,0.11141634
wit shows up in front of Thanos and she's like you took everything from me,0.40310448
he goes I don't even know you she's like you will now ah and she,0.3602014
tapes him down that he was going to take him out Thanos was trippin the,0.24694069
only reason she didn't kill him right then and there was because the sky started,0.48089996
raining fire from his ship what a badass nlgger Wanda has had amazing moments in,0.60496837
these two films she doesn't get that much screen time and the other ones but,0.15161565
boy she just shines in these two movies and she's barely in this movie oh,0.18500173
well we see how we see her last one that scene or spider-man and Iron,0.17465027
Man reunite on the field and Peter starts filling in made on what happened mr.,0.054629445
Schad you wouldn't believe how I turn into dust and then I just woke up,0.4864159
and dr. strangers like it's been five years and Tony just gives him a hug,0.070641145
you know it's just such a full-circle moment from when we first saw them together,0.08754701
we'll be on to five times I cried I cried way more than five times,0.05819668
the second the opening scene started and it was Hawkeye and his daughter I was,0.08731286
like oh my god I'm gonna have to watch him watch his family who the,0.0657895
nlgger away I started crying right then from the very first moment they had me,0.29338378
and it didn't let up the entire time when I laughed it was like laughing,0.061195564
through teary-eyed miss moment - and Tony Stark was rescued and brought back down to,0.15747622
earth you know he basically had a mental breakdown and he takes the thing out,0.5223251
of his chest and I lost it - gasp it came out of my mouth,0.770163
it was brutal man three second I realized they were going to varam here I,0.24896917
know they don't know that they knows kill Kimura because he need to do for,0.65666735
the Soul so bone so frustrated that like no one even theorized but that could,0.19557105
have possibly been in it why would it be because none of the other stones,0.11841249
required that although I didn't think I was gonna cry it didn't really hit me,0.1212324
in the soul until Hawkeye jumped off and Natasha jumped after him and they were,0.18864293
like hanging from the thread and the same music was playing from when Gamora was,0.24117164
pushed just brought all those feel back it was the same shots and it's just,0.11058496
so upsetting and I'm crying again for that moment the big three are fighting Thanos,0.10948007
at the end and they're losing again it doesn't really hit you emotionally until caps,0.15209144
shield starts breaking Santos is breaking his shield it gets you so down but then,0.14874905
it makes moment five so much more rewarding the entire theater broke out in tears,0.080429696
I just started crying harder it was a happy cry when all the portals started,0.15512265
opening up and everyone came out of it you you just hear the Black Panther,0.2570775
army like I above bay and such a beautiful moment and they all just get,0.08275784
there kind of cameos as you go across all the different portals and it's just,0.10350873
such a fantastic overwhelming scene we feel all the things and they look at banners,0.044455457
and he's like nlgger I wasn't expecting that and six yes I have one more,0.3718656
at Toni's funeral when that little wreath floats out onto the lake and it's holding,0.109261796
true that Tony Stark has a heart okay my favorite jokes opposite end of the,0.079269834
spectrum here there are so many great funny moments in this film I did see,0.07508366
I wasn't expecting as many as we got but they were woven in beautifully the,0.06502482
first one for me as the first scene after the cold open with nebula and,0.071684696
Tony playing paper football at the table Tony trying to teach nebula how to have,0.09993047
fun it was really really nice - what a great moment it was we went,0.07165997
back to 2014 on that planet where star-lord started a guardians of the galaxy the,0.09576045
whole sequence is iconic now him dancing with the headphones on I got the music,0.06115784
rocket and then we pull out and see them nebula and war machines Andrew to,0.14988306
this very dangerous weapon on this planet so he's an idiot yes three here another,0.9021595
nebula moment maybe they really shine does the straight man and a lot of the,0.17733803
jokes movie and this one she in rocket just landing outside the avengers headquarters and,0.11641796
it manson there was taco taco blows away and she walks up and stops and,0.1531361
she's like rocket be careful this idiot us four is when Thor is catching the,0.8785311
Avengers up on his experience with the Infinity stones and everyone's just side eyeing each,0.1534505
other and then you go to ant-man and he's like oh yeah subtler nodding along,0.3922407
totally and do it it's just great everything that ant-man at this table was great,0.2785673
because he's so irrelevant and that brings me to the crowning moment of this whole,0.24145466
table scene where rocket walks over to ant-man and starts patting his head rock it,0.28150547
really shined comedic lee in this film he didn't have too many lines but every,0.086793974
line he had was fantastic I liked the moment in the beginning where it's so,0.05723297
dark and everyone's so sad and rocket speaks and Tony goes literally up to this,0.15232608
moment I thought you were built of air and rockets like maybe I am the,0.33508715
final category issues I had with the film hahaha it's very rare that a film,0.08267445
does time-travel like this one does and it doesn't step into any plot holes like,0.090086505
there's just too many direction my first issue with the film I'm accepting it it's,0.05239037
fine it's just gonna be something that floats around in my head because I love,0.16926292
time-travel stuff and I want to know exactly how everything works and I feel like,0.05855378
the roles of this time-travel universe were kind of blurry they were like Back to,0.124295406
the Future Back to the Future yeah that's not how time works you dink it,0.23640305
and then we're all like then how does it work how does it work and,0.05455826
they never explain it I need a lecture so I could just so we can,0.09516303
see it cuz there are moments where I just just don't see it I know,0.074515
hypothetically the idea that they take the stones way and then put them all back,0.36520717
makes it so nothing happens but in between the time where they're not there and,0.078152835
they're using them doesn't everything change until they put them back and it changes but,0.07833748
you know I'm saying what he's I need the parameters so I can visualize the,0.0892066
timeline is it just is it going off into the darkest I just need to,0.06133029
know it's not clear and I'm sure maybe they have it clear in their heads,0.47055927
but my head is blurring like what nebulous shot herself at the end oh that,0.5540749
that's past you why didn't she a battery why didn't she fade out of the,0.058116835
picture they go back to the future see this do the rule is that my,0.07625006
mind could comprehend I was just like whoa what what what it doesn't make sense,0.08690016
it doesn't make sense now that Gamora is in the present day what happened to,0.060080506
past good morning past Moore never happened what - this water juice I get something,0.080888
about it cats chill okay so cap has his emotional ball but at the end,0.13460237
and it refined of ruin the moment before me didn't ruin it but like it,0.15376931
made it less potent sounds like where did you get that shield cat last time,0.09931714
I saw it was nlgger broken it was pretty broken I was crying about it,0.24978516
okay and now he's just hot shiny brand-new one where did you where'd you get,0.28906587
that I just did you steal it from yourself in the past I mean because,0.31089434
he's still had to go through this moment I just wait I don't get it,0.110340945
like how is it shiny and new but also old but you're all the wood,0.27740982
bro have you got it from the past you still need to give it to,0.088385984
your few dips in your future self and you've hurt yourself broken did some either,0.5154597
new one I did Commission a new one but then it's not like his shield,0.10140941
it's just like a new shield I loved when he kind of passed the torch,0.14663105
to Falcon little of Falcon he's so cool I wish she was in the movies,0.13853602
more but hey I just where'd you get it we explained three lookey and the,0.07396721
tesseract look you picked up the tesseract yo and disappeared and how come this hasn't,0.092120595
change of timeline where are the ripples I just I can't comprehend it he just,0.07699722
goes off into a separate timeline cuz he was already in our timeline so why,0.07377011
didn't it change the time in the present Oh does that mean at this time,0.0512883
that we saw them fighting that Loki was also off with a third tesseract like,0.15661559
there's the tesseract in that time Santos is broken there's a tesseract that they have,0.091803946
in their glove and then there's also Loki off in another world land with his,0.053711493
tesseract like I don't how could they coexist what's happening what we never resolved that,0.08387977
so I'm assuming it has something to do with one of the various shows Disney's,0.040684048
working on but I don't understand how it didn't affect Avenger tae-hwan he's just saying,0.11948983
this always happened like did he always take it for this isn't a huge issue,0.07262004
it's just very confusing there's a touching moment when ant-man opened the door and his,0.108489856
daughter was there I teared up but also I was like why is this daughter,0.15158457
a hundred years older we saw her five minutes alone she's like 11 and now,0.11989639
she's like 28 I mean she's at my age I couldn't really compute like it,0.32817942
was five years so she should be like 1718 a most what happened there five,0.084782824
I where there I have a couple more than five plus five is there nothing,0.060901456
with the time and the age kind of making things a little confusing because spider-man,0.121741444
at the end reuniting with Ned they have this nice moment but at the same,0.053962007
time we all have to think that high school is less than five years so,0.11192343
either both of them poof in that case they hadn't seen each other since like,0.19246766
two days ago or something and they're having an emotional reunion or he didn't poof,0.17295547
and didn't age and is still in high school five years later it doesn't make,0.06569752
any sense and also so for this to work for spider-man to every one of,0.19146663
spider-man's people who is friends with has to have poofed so that they could still,0.27506158
be in school together or they're just all three falling it out of school and,0.14522988
there's still friends and that's why they're going far away from home I haven't watched,0.049615234
the spider-man trailers so please don't spoil me six this is the most annoying thing,0.29489818
for me first with Thor he's back in time and this is the only chance,0.063802175
you have to save the universe like not just one person or ten people or,0.18528403
a country the universe and Thor's like I had this I can't do this I,0.08302458
need someone it goes to you whine like this isn't a serious thing and he,0.31993732
just takes his sweet-ass time and like Rockets like no this is serious and he,0.8497582
walks off and Thor just like turns around walks the other way and disappears this,0.08000734
is no time for hijinks no of course rocket gets done because he gets it,0.3142588
done but it still was like really right now and then the other one was,0.051806178
really irritated with uncap walked into Peggy's office without realizing it he was like oh,0.11003777
what well officer accidentally stumble into nostalgically to look off into the distance Peggy and,0.072888486
then he looks through the window and we're on a time line people are noticing,0.08728267
that they don't belong here we need to get out of there he needs to,0.1539833
find Iron Man but he's just like oh look Peggy and he slowly looks through,0.19136672
the window and slowly comes really close to it et phone home me love Peggy,0.078421764
and I'm just dead you're like excuse me people need you nlgger get out of,0.7876319
there you have a mission what you're doing we'll come back a time you see,0.055546705
her later if you don't do this now you can never see Peggy but he's,0.27572435
just like LA and I get it we're supposed to be like Oh cap and,0.067405425
Peggy never really even started but like right now I don't care because everyone poofed,0.27863088
if you don't do this right now that's it I know everything works out fine,0.1476101
except for one thing and that that's my next number seven like we all saw,0.09634932
this nebulous thing coming a mile away I wish it was just like a little,0.149176
a little less obvious that nebula and I Bueller go switch places and the other,0.078555815
nebula would be the evil Nebula and then a little thing don't get me wrong,0.24195226
it was fun to have Shrek in the film but I just think it was,0.070916854
a weird tonal shift that happened very quickly look also we see Bruce Banner and,0.09694893
he's like a better Hulk and Hulk is gone after we just got to know,0.09518802
Hulk as a separate person in thor ragnarok a couple years ago it's just weird,0.15086918
that they gave him like a separate personality so we kind of got to know,0.096360885
both people Bruce Banner and Hulk and then Hulk was gone it wasn't a mess,0.14951092
should the two of them it was just bruised and it's kind of like okay,0.26025733
where did Hulk go and also how did this happen it's kind of a one-off,0.09673039
where he just says you know I exposed myself to more gamma radiation and then,0.105780385
we fused into one but really we just fused into Bruce Banner with Hulk's body,0.15134892
I just thought it kind of felt silly the whole time I like original Bruce,0.30375844
Banner that we meet in Avengers he just comes off much smarter and when Bruce,0.21003856
Banner looks like the Hulk he just kinda seems silly like you try to be,0.69542736
smart but he's really just a baby in a giant body when he's trying to,0.3926513
figure out how to send ant-man through time and ant-man is just like circling throughout,0.26651478
human lifespan that's how I picked you Bruce Banner when he's the Hulk he's just,0.4797117
so goofy I'd love to know your top five in any of the categories that,0.5612659
I went through I'm so excited that star might be in the Guardians 3 he's,0.098428726
gone my name is Christine my book comes out like next week for the game,0.060255118
but better it will be available wherever books are sold but if you're interested and,0.10219462
