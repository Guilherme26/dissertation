hello,0.054463096
there inside out is the newest movie by Pixar films or studios or whatever,0.078501016
I don't really know what it's called exactly and stars Amy Poehler Bill Hader the one chick from the office who played Phyllis Lewis Black & Mindy Kaling and it's about a young girl named Riley who's about 12 years old and lives in Minnesota and she said incredible life friends family plays,0.07976859
hockey everything's great until her whole life is upturned by her moving to San Francisco and the movie instead of just being you know drama about a normal girl as it is,0.15351728
Pixar we've got to do something,0.06001743
interesting we've got to do something,0.046720807
personified and so this movie is not about Riley so much as it is about Riley's emotions Riley's,0.07474124
brain the five emotions inside her head that our joy sadness anger disgust and fear and through this you could see how these emotions interact and how they influence one another which kind of makes up how our brain chemistry works and its really really interesting take on how we are able to make our own,0.24228516
decisions and how the memories that we have in our past affect,0.059590645
us and how we forget things and our imagination and just so many many incredible ideas that really make this film one of the best animated movies to come out in a long long time now I've been disillusioned with Pixar for a little bit because in my personal opinion I really haven't loved any of their movies since 2006,0.07398011
I think cars is an absolute masterpiece in every single movie they made before,0.12577248
that was an absolute masterpiece ratatouille was the first one where was like yeah it was okay and all the other ones really just weren't that memorable toy story 3 notwithstanding of course so when people were acting oh my god pit inside outs coming out in my mind,0.16470315
it was like this looks really great I love the concept and the premise and I was like you know what I feel like Pixar's back and my opinion,0.06242354
this is their comeback for me,0.08350158
I like they've had a dry spell for a while and I'm just as excited for the next movie the good dinosaur but to focus in on inside out,0.14696638
this movie is incredible it is so well done,0.11125256
I think it's probably at least in their top three of greatest films that they've made first off the animation itself was just beautiful,0.11877824
I love how the emotions in the film look like they're made out of like this sort of fuzzy sparkly kind of like imaginative you know brain matter or whatever the first emotion that dough that is in somebody's head is a shot that Riley as a child her mind is joy,0.36282924
and when joy shows up she only has one button the press and that's just flat because there's nothing else on this like this is tiny little control panel,0.14251904
and that's it didn't like little parts of her mind will start appearing,0.3006639
and it's like the brain is starting to develop itself core memories the things that really make you a person the train of thought which a meat,0.26231056
which made me chuckle immediately as soon as they said there was a train of thought I took a second and I got it the tracks disappear and literally that they is described by another character as oh it just kind of goes all over the place um besides the animation itself all the voice acting is great Amy Poehler just completely its best role ever I've seen her and she's so good as joy and her relationship with sadness was really interesting,0.07401555
Mindy,0.050441623
Kaling is really really entertaining is discussed liked her much more than I thought I would,0.07909351
and of course Lewis Black is just completely perfect casting as anger who i'm sure all the kids loved when he his head catches on fire my favorite character in the film was actually fear,0.24149874
i thought he was really really well done and kind of an underused player in all of this bill hader plays him expertly part of joy,0.09597935
and sadness adventure,0.076288976
takes them to dream productions which is at night,0.09667057
when Riley goes to sleep there's this movie studio that puts on these shows and they are watched by only one thing which is fear ever anger,0.11505654
disgust everything else is asleep,0.45823497
except,0.0738503
fear he stays awake okay,0.11012848
and he's just sitting there watching these things that basically it's just,0.08742432
it's just hidden reacting whether he gets afraid or not,0.09038532
and it's just like him gone,0.1496272
oh yeah this is boring,0.28172463
oh she's a bad actress blah blah and it was app,0.60495
that was my favorite scene in the movie by far it was not just because it was funny it was just so clever and the way they were doing it on how like everybody was being played by like a thought figment of her imagination and then they put on a rat reality distortion filter over the lens and it just looks like they're all people,0.17681451
uh and it was it was funny I also like how they have a little bit,0.2168272
they have a little joke about film predictability where they were fears just going,0.108008035
oh yeah her pants are probably going to be down isn't it,0.29113948
Oh yep fan sir down that was it's just the things that these people must have thought up when they were coming up with this movie,0.11407806
they must have had a ball with it,0.16298978
there is a really really powerful subplot or may perhaps the main plot which is the joys relationship with sadness,0.07423249
and how you would imagine those two don't get along and how joy just really doesn't understand sadness,0.12521093
she doesn't understand her purpose,0.31362614
why is she here of course and her mind said this should just you know not really exist,0.3350578
why should a person be sad and sadness also doesn't really understand who she is or why she exists and that whole relationship and the the coming to understand each other is a huge core of the film and that and that of course at a time in a girl's life where she is moving dealing with all these emotions joy and sadness are struggling with each other that's exactly what would happen,0.07160777
it's the exact point in time where an adventure such of this would occur in her head we're both joy and sadness kind of become lost to you know anger and fear and disgust and it totally makes sense during a fight between these two characters they accidentally become lost somewhere in the confines of Riley's brain,0.2692815
and they must work their way through,0.043212406
it try and find their way back to the control center where they can try and make Riley happy again,0.068854
some kids would see it as just a interesting fantasy adventure about these personified emotions,0.24239692
but it's actually a really really deep story and a really really interesting take on you know the way a person reacts to change,0.056056134
and the way kids sometimes have to act a certain way in front of their parents versus the way they would act in front of other people,0.15247418
what would cause certain things to happen such as why do you start crying in the middle of happy memory sometimes because it's nostalgic and sad because you just don't have the thing more and they explore all these different aspects of it,0.10200227
and that was really interesting to be honest a lot of the emotions were totally different than I thought,0.054960817
they were going to be a particularly fear,0.1528078
instead of you know just being afraid of everything,0.12686339
he's trying to keep Riley safe,0.09278218
no matter,0.09967093
what he's trying to help her he's not actually a very unhappy person her constantly afraid as I thought he would be,0.30872512
he just has a tendency to become afraid most of maybe he's just being cautious,0.14905927
he's just trying to be you know helpful,0.114315055
and I really really like that I thought that was really interesting similarly anger isn't just this villain,0.20897901
one of the best things about this movie is that they don't go that route and they don't take emotions like anger or sadness or fear and they make them villains there is no villain in this movie,0.09566174
and that is one of the best things about it,0.06306295
it's that the the real enemy is just life,0.15335605
and the problems we encounter like there's no enemy to fight,0.07005108
there's no bad guy to defeat,0.19271563
there's just a situation that you need to overcome which is that's the way life is there's no enemy,0.09439248
there's no no one,0.07261451
you can point the finger at except this is just the things we're going through,0.12172569
and I think that that's one of the most powerful things about it,0.06266658
and I love that,0.037727673
and of course where the story goes ends up being really interesting of joy coming to terms with sadnesses existence and satisfying a purpose and it was really really really beautiful and really really interesting and it just all came up and wrapped together in this little bow,0.11364017
and when I won't finish the movie I'm like that was perfect All Things Considered I would give inside out a nine out of ten thanks for watching,0.1579898
