I was watching a live-action movie there are countless shots in this movie where my,0.0930419
jaw just dropped because I couldn't believe that this is actually an animated film it's,0.10348395
just it's amazing what Pixar is able to do it every time they come out,0.036540534
with a new film whether it be a sequel or something original the animation just,0.03404809

absolutely no exception this is probably I think this might be the most beautiful movie,0.032852754

and the day they know in the land of the dead but there's so much,0.08390892
more to the story and so much they're not telling you which I actually really,0.03519021
appreciate it because we travelers nowadays they kind of just tend to spoil everything for,0.03140066
you and there's no really there's no surprises left when you actually go see the,0.02611511
film itself but in this movie the story is really engaging it keeps you guessing,0.026708454
like I said before or Pixar actually goes to a dark place when the big,0.0942818
twist of the movie is revealed I will say there is a twist in this,0.032848097
moment not obviously gonna tell you what it is but I think it's really well,0.042867094
done it's really well handled it's kind of multi-layer and I really enjoyed that Pixar,0.044722956
wasn't afraid to go to that territory wasn't afraid to go to that dark place,0.09024613
to create a more mature story not just for you know kids but for adults,0.013789922
to appreciate as well I really loved that you know Pixar not only caters to,0.044293914
kids but adults who are inevitably gonna be taking their kids to see this movie,0.068815246
I like that balance story is great I think there's a lot of great humor,0.017524263

I think that the humor in this movie really helps bring this amazing sense of,0.025570324
adventure to the proceedings I mean the story never felt stale or boring I was,0.028421966
never you know disinterested in the Smoky's never bored watching and not at all the,0.036453392
movie flies by the pacing is great the thing that 100% made me fall in,0.033476032
love with this movie is the heart the heart is the core of Coco and,0.03198868
kind of the core of Pixar in general when they do need their story's justice,0.034509726
and the heart just sells the crap out of this movie there is so much,0.31121844
heart bursting from this movie it's not melodramatic it's not haphazardly done it's done with,0.050794087
such earnest tea that you can't help but get completely involved with these characters get,0.015676383
completely emotionally invested in this story and there are multiple times where I teared up,0.020222249
during the course of this movie worried just you know those tears felt earned that,0.013154007
you know that drama felt earned and it's just I really loved that Pixar is,0.019167932
able to pull off that kind of drawing I mean there's a sometimes there's better,0.051423352
drama and Pixar movies than there are and live-action films it's sad to say but,0.026584065
it's the truth I mean the heart is what brings these characters to life it's,0.026377192
what makes this adventure so engaging in it was what ultimately makes this movie work,0.044311874
so well because you know having a fun adventure you know family felt is one,0.032344554
thing but having that with heart that's what makes it a fully rounded movie and,0.0410711
that's what makes it a fully rounded movie going experience because I'm the kind of,0.022688083
movie goer yeah I want to have fun but I also want to be emotionally,0.09821636
invested in the story and the characters you know and I want to I don't,0.015780818
want that story to end because I feel so attached to them and that's kind,0.032083802
of how I felt with Coco I didn't want it to end I wanted the,0.020632
20-minute frozen short that came before the movie to heaven because that sucked and I,0.40228552
like the first frozen I just didn't want to see that but this was really,0.013738703
a movie I could have watched probably two more hours over and just enjoyed the,0.027208671
I mean I really don't have any problems with Coco I think it's funny I,0.04894621

most culturally culture my god what are words it's one of their most culturally rich,0.10479104
movies I think that they've ever made and I want them to make more movies,0.053971004
like Coco if this movie shows that Pixar still has an imagination that we came,0.042855788
to you know fall in love with so long ago that they're still capable of,0.0727671
making great original films and you know if we get more films like Coco from,0.051446635
Pixar they're just gonna be a force to be reckoned with again I think this,0.053313803
is a step way in the right direction for Pixar I want them to make,0.03583078
more movies like this yeah we got the Incredibles - coming out next year but,0.053869233
I'm always more excited for the original movies because when they're like Coco they're mesmerizing,0.041574642
