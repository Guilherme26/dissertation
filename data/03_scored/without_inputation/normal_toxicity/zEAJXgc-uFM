hi welcome to Reza views today i'm gonna be,0.17400162
reviewing thor ragnarok this is the third thor film and the 17th installment in the MCU,0.052913517
so by now you should know they're not you're into these movies,0.19025724
there's been a lot of hype surrounding this film especially because its promotional materials seem to show that they're taking a completely different direction and a new tone when it comes to the Thor movies which was a welcome change for me because I felt that the previous Thor movie stuck themselves a little bit too seriously,0.05989786
this was directed by Taika Waititi who's not a very well known director,0.17026521
he's directed a small film called what we do,0.12902337
in the shadow which is a hilarious mockumentary that I definitely recommend and I'm a big fan of so I'm very happy to see such a small-time director get his big shot and do a big Marvel film,0.26895404
and I was looking forward to seeing what he's gonna do with it,0.08548369
and I think seen the film my first impression of it is that it was fun with a capital S,0.0906759
I generally liked Thor Ragnarok a lot and I definitely enjoyed it,0.09206897
but it has its ups and down,0.09621234
so I'm gonna dive in now and start talking about the ups the top three things that I liked about,0.08737734
thor ragnarok number three the visual style,0.09086103
I really liked how this film looked and felt this movie is extremely colorful,0.07852697
and it felt like it had this 80s cam to it which was really enjoyable,0.12871258
editing in the soundtrack together make up for this amazing visual extravaganza that you completely enjoy especially when it comes to the fighting season this movie has awesome fighting cease really cool stuff,0.14625183
the costume design is also very cool,0.053432267
so it gets his helmet,0.1431568
finally we get to see that and it looks pretty badass and the number one outfit in the whole thing for me was Hellas costume,0.1466295
it's so cool,0.059265897
I cannot wait turn that into a cosplay the look and feel of this film takes a huge departure from the first and second Thor movies it looks more like guardians of the galaxy than anything else in them see you and it really helps make you feel like you are somewhere out of this earth because come on our real world,0.09259144
it's kind of boring when you compare it to the extravaganza of the cosmos,0.18133622
the number two thing I liked about Thor Ragnarok was Valkyrie introducing a new character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is not easy because there's so many of them so it's very hard for a new character to make an impact,0.0843341
however Valkyrie played brilliantly by Tessa Thompson is an exception to the rule,0.078568645
she's funny she's cool she's but uh she's a great fighter she had really nice chemistry with Thor and everybody else and with the Hulk,0.10002454
I really liked her and I can't wait to see more the number one thing I liked,0.10373357
but Thor Ragnarok was expanding the MCU similarly to guardians of the galaxy,0.10826279
and also Doctor Strange this movie expands the world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a very nice way where it takes it outside of the human world and the human first world's problems and ties us into,0.15735076
what's coming which is infinity war turned out sweet in the previous floor films especially the second one Thor seem to always be compelled to come back to earth and interact with humans for some reason,0.10274889
it's like we can't enjoy the floor unless he was with other human characters,0.11230361
but this time he's completely free from those shackles,0.072700664
and he's out there in the universe interacting with crazy things and crazy characters and things that are as over-the-top and ask powerful as he is,0.24252528
and also this movie expanded the universe in terms of the mythos and it felt like it was very Nordic in nature,0.10227925
we really felt like the mystical world of the Vikings and their gods and their mythology really come through in this film more than any of the other films,0.14889476
I didn't enjoy everything about Thor Ragnarok,0.09187541
so here are the top three things I didn't like about the movie number three not all the characters work through,0.05009147
I really like Thor holic and as I mentioned Valkyrie and a lot of other characters that were in this film but there are two characters that didn't work for me at all,0.05973709
and one of them is Jeff Goldblum as Grand Master an apologist,0.086340375
Oh Jeff Goldblum fans out there,0.0981947
but I haven't really enjoyed most of his recent performances because they all really feel like they are the same thing,0.053840157
and in this movie it was no exception,0.074230745
I always felt like whenever,0.06317251
the Grand Master was on screen that oh look I'm watching Jeff go boom it's a movie it really took me out of the film and disconnected me from it completely which I never liked another character that didn't work for me is Keith Urban's skirt who I felt was kind of pointless,0.26593488
I didn't really buy into his story,0.04677356
I didn't really care about him,0.110840365
and I felt like he was kind of a waste of time,0.45497409
and now let's see even the performance wasn't that great,0.086074255
he felt like he was just there to be there,0.07893583
I really liked Ella as a character,0.059379846
and as a villain in this movie however I felt like her character was a little bit mishandled in the sense that her scenes seem to clash so much with general tone of the film and also we didn't spend enough time with her she was mostly there to be a mock piece for certain exposition and explaining her backstory to us when I thought that her backstory was so compelling I wish I actually saw it,0.112960435
so as a character,0.08050636
and as a concept was pretty cool,0.054516368
and as a performance catcher did an amazing job and she looked good in this movie I mean geez look at that woman she looks incredible however towards the end of the film I felt her role was not as expansive as I wanted it to be,0.18262038
and I felt like it was cut a little too short,0.24239962
and I didn't also feel like she meshed well with the rest of the film speaking of the tone,0.06811141
the second thing I didn't like about,0.073264994
thor ragnarok was the extreme tone change like I said earlier I am a fan of the change of the tone from the other,0.09319636
Thor films but this film felt like it went a little bit too far change and experimenting is a good thing,0.10594027
and I like seeing a fresh take on a character or on a franchise,0.0663613
however this film completely disconnected from the first and a second Thor so I feel like there is such a thing as too much fun or too funny,0.059281923
I didn't recognize Thor's character in this movie,0.050827585
he's so different from all of the other films sometimes in a good way,0.18317771
but sometimes it's felt like I went a little too far and the same applies to Hulk as well which leads me to the number one thing I didn't like about thor ragnarok which is the fact that the stakes were not high due to the overtly comical fun times thing that the movie was doing I never felt like any of the characters were in any real danger,0.059691075
and no stakes are never a good thing for a movie especially if it's action-packed because those action scenes lose their intensity,0.083433434
if you don't think anybody's gonna get really hurt,0.14861041
and the reason why I thought that's because everything was a joke even intense emotional scenes were overshadowed by jokes and people not taking things seriously,0.12683314
I mean if the characters don't take the situation seriously,0.06640981
I'm not gonna take the situation seriously,0.078802384
and I feel like this is gonna bother the comic book readers more than most people,0.080780946
but when you say Ragnarok Ragnarok is the end of days it's a disaster of epic proportions and that kind of Armageddon feel never really translated well it's like oh my god the most horrible thing is about to happen,0.1951965
oh my god this also girls would be a little bit emotionally disconnected from the movie and from the characters and also didn't leave me with anything to contemplate or think about in terms of themes in terms of character moments and character arcs,0.10480902
it's just felt a little too shallow which means I don't think this movie is going to leave a lasting impression,0.12236172
but only time will tell if I'm right or wrong,0.06929997
oh I had a good time watching this movie it's definitely my favorite Thor movie but it's not my favorite MCU movie but if you've liked the MCU films so far and you'll definitely enjoy this one as well it's a solid fun Marvel movie and I'm gonna give Thor Ragnarok and eight out of ten so have you seen Thor did you like it,0.08586663
let me know what you thought,0.0664153
I'd also tell me in the comment section what's your favorite Marvel movie today mine is still Civil War let me know in the comment section and as always like share and subscribe and don't forget to ask me what you would like me to review for you next see ya,0.07953733
