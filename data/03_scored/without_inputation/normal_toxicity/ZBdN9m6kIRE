hi I'm angel,0.05740235
and this is my review of the movie get outs written and directed by Jordan Peele most notably known for Key & Peele the skit comedy show on Comedy Central and the basic premise is that Rose wants to invite Chris to meet her family in the woods and he is just concerned that they might not know that they aren't of the same color she tells them don't,0.09646748
worry he goes along with it and horror movie comedy,0.24195662
ensues I have to say that this is my favorite movie of,0.076162346
2017 I have seen tons of reviews of the movie I watched it twice already with friends with,0.037993044
family I just wanted to add another review out,0.0653829
there but I don't know if I can say anything that hasn't already been said about this movie it is brilliant first of all,0.061460603
Jordan Peele are you kidding me is this the first time you're writing and directing a movie a plus incredible not only is it filmed,0.15566598
properly the pacing is,0.050705135
right there is symbolism,0.056024894
everywhere I actually had to read an article after watching the movie about little symbols and hints that you may have,0.089319825
missed within the movie,0.057465777
and there's so much going on you don't catch everything,0.14383568
there's a lot I did catch but a lot I didn't and that was what was surprising it's really thought out,0.03793568
and it is a funny movie it is the kind of scary movie that you watch with friends with tons of people,0.22027591
and all audiences I do not think,0.07073658
this is a movie for any audience,0.08297666
in particular there is a dynamic,0.0660973
there especially specifically black Americans and white Americans that is addressed under layers of comedy and horror thriller,0.31089434
there are some scenes that aren't even part of a war movie,0.08433253
they're just like real-life like the garden party scene at the Armitage his house where Chris is scrutinized and asked the most uncomfortable questions that's a reality for a lot of people in America and it's sad that some people don't know that,0.11890795
and that's what I really appreciated is that this movie started a lot of necessary discussions around the world when I watch this movie with friends some people didn't really like the way Daniel kahl√∫a played Chris they thought he was a bit too muted in his acting and I kind of agreed but at the same time I don't because we're so used to seeing big acting in war movies,0.08436037
and if you really look back especially the second time I watch this movie around there are subtleties in Daniels acting that really harm masterfully done just wow you see a multitude of emotions crosses face in moments,0.17884874
there's so much doubt and he's in a situation that makes a lot of people,0.06655329
when you are the minority in a situation like this you feel uncomfortable,0.30510893
you feel paranoid you feel crazy,0.7777244
it kind of reminded me of my experience at a resort in Cuba and the people around you make you feel like no you're seeing things that aren't there which is kind of what Daniel goes through with Rose I think your family's kind of racist the way they interact with me,0.2980943
and Rose is just like I think you're reading way too much into it Alison as Rose did also a fantastic job really well done,0.06564756
and it's hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it but I'm trying I'm gonna try not to say anything spoilery until I really get to the spoilers,0.134968
I didn't see the story going the way it did it really did take me by surprise,0.059058808
it's very well written Betty Gabriel as Georgina gave me chills,0.14922541
okay there are moments in her acting subtle but powerful and after you've seen the movie once I urge people to see it again,0.0853002
because you will see layers upon layers of acting there and you'll just be like oh my goodness girl Wow I'm talking James McAvoy split-level acting here anyone acting for me Marcus Henderson as Walter - the gardener did a good,0.111471504
job he really did my brain is going all over the place with this,0.3490814
movie there are scenes in the film that seem,0.046914037
random and that seem like typical horror movie,0.19373342
moments for example there's a scene where Walters just like sprinting at,0.07029519
night,0.045449704
and there's that scene in the trailer where Chris talks to Georgina and the meltdown,0.15060985
and the episode that happens up on Georgina's face is everything,0.29586655
and you understand at the end,0.083051145
everything comes together so cleverly,0.09993929
but I started coming actually,0.039567653
and when we get to the end when we get to the reveal when we figure out what's going on personally everything kind of started to click in my head,0.16980402
oh I think I know where this is going ok,0.054166093
but still even when you think you know what's going it,0.09831197
doesn't go where you think it'll go it keeps surprising you at every turn,0.15014106
and that's what I really appreciated the end is just phenomenal phenomenal ending for a movie not just a horror movie just any movie in general the twists the turns the little events beautiful loved it lil rel Howery plays the best friend rod Williams and he is such a necessary character he is the goofy funny best friend the TSA agent he is perfect in this movie he really balances out,0.35079557
he's like the sweet to the sour chicken,0.3242413
and the casting was just my excelente Bradley Whitford I just wanted to say as Dean Armitage as a father he's an actor that I didn't think could be scary and Stern but he brought it in this movie he makes you comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time Missy the mother played by Catherine Keener also in the same realm,0.0732214
she's like sweet french toast,0.17326713
you know a woman that you would just picture as just the sweetest but she has moments of seriousness in this movie that gave me chills,0.2019961
I have to say the sunken place is a brilliant invention and it describes,0.09189991
so many moments in life so perfectly being trapped within yourself not being able to speak up when there are things that you want to say feeling powerless that's exactly what the sunken place is it's when you are put in a situation where you feel powerless and it's such an accurate metaphor for how Chris feels in this environment look Keith Stanfield plays Andre and he is one of my favorite actors do Momo,0.085131854
he's a character in Atlanta,0.11125268
and I really love this actor and he was also brilliantly cast the moment with the flash and his panic,0.11754359
oh there was so much fear in his eyes so much presence the Keith man that is one actor to follow and I'm rooting for him all day okay now I'm gonna get into a real spoilery moment,0.17694192
so you've been warned,0.31468517
the ending spoiled apparently there was an alternative ending to this movie where instead of our man lil rel showing up the cops would show up and it was actually going to end a lot darker than it did,0.16428386
and I'm very glad that they rewrote the ending and made it light and heroic and we got justice in that moment because ah life is already sad enough we don't need that we need heroes in most horror movies the protagonist gets away he survives and he walks into the sunset usually with a woman on his arm,0.17856506
so I'm really glad that they treated this as such and gave us a breath of fresh air um TSA,0.06464212
yeah handle that I also thought that moment with Chris and Rose where he was choking the life out of her was interesting,0.31217197
she was smiling some people didn't know how to interpret that I felt like she was smiling at the fact that she felt she was winning in this moment like she was being proven right,0.07602795
that's the stereotypical angry animalistic murderous black man is in all black men and she pulled it out of him,0.83502066
I think that's what he felt,0.10476769
it kind of brought him back to,0.07793177
Oh I am sinking to your level right now,0.11136987
and I'm not gonna do that,0.09711196
and I don't know race had nothing to do with it if anyone gets treated the way Chris hasn't had been treated oh that girl had to go,0.20121288
I mean it would have been justified,0.119280666
I'm not on the side of murderer,0.5777954
I just want to make that clear I'm just saying it would have been justified,0.08401396
and it was funny watching this movie has a mixed person the black side of me was like no man get out get out um,0.40310097
I'm sensing danger,0.10670747
things are weird especially with Caleb,0.08303353
the younger brother after that scene in the dinner mm-hmm but the white side of me was like oh we should stay and investigate I mean you never know,0.15543044
maybe,0.038781885
he could uncover something,0.07831607
maybe Rose is right,0.056150056
maybe we should give her the benefit of the doubt you know,0.061232314
maybe,0.038781885
he needs to go into the crawl spaces into her room into that cabinet see what's going on um,0.23856705
don't go there don't open that cabinet leave,0.100079745
so yeah being mixed in a horror movie there aren't many of us but we usually die medium,0.40333098
you know not at the beginning but we don't make it to the end,0.07096578
I could go on forever and gush about this movie loved it so much,0.13180004
