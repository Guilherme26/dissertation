hi yes hello and welcome back to another millennial movie monday if you're new here hi my name is ashley and if you're a returner welcome back i'm a millennial that likes to take your classic movies and watch them for the very first time oh this reminds me in my p.o box a couple weeks ago in my live i got there's cat hair on it i got this hat and i was told i need to wear it when i watch casablanca now i kind of got i kind of got a big ass head but anyways so if you haven't read the thumbnail or seen the title or heard what i just said today's millennial movie monday is me watching the 1942 casablanca you know actually this might be the oldest let me look it up it would have to be a tie between this and it's a wonderful life oh this is officially the oldest because it's a wonderful life came out in 1946 i do believe this is the oldest movie on my channel i put a poll up between fried green tomatoes and casablanca they were neck and neck for the longest time i showed you in my fried greens tomato reaction that my mother was the end-all be-all she told me to watch and let me tell you something some people got butt hurt they were like we're trying to introduce you to a movie classic how could you listen to your mother and not watch possibility i'm getting to it now you just had to wait an extra week any time this movie came up i was told that it's an absolute movie classic it's pretty much a staple for movies and how movies progressed so i'm very excited to see the grandfather of movies i don't know if that's safe to say i don't know anything about it so far the only thing i know about it is fedora alright so this is what i am looking at and i clearly have too big of a head i don't know that's not the point the point is i'm wearing a fedora and so is this guy casablanca humphrey bogard which you guys told me he will definitely make it onto a list of people who could get it a very dashing gentleman a prominent fedora and a beautiful lady so i'm gonna assume that this is a love story it looks like we're gonna be into another classic black and white film no i didn't plan to do two classic black and white films back to back just how the cookie crumbled not mad at it but i am excited to get started in this 40s classic so enough little darling let's get right on into the 1940s casablanca [Music] wow look at that classic warner brothers logo was that person's name dooley like those little crocheted circles my grandma had all over the house lisbon became the great embarkation point but that's a beautiful opening shot i love that look at that little monkey little monkeys wow their pants go all the way up to their nipples that's so funny her hat is interesting this place that man is wearing a zebra print a tie and a mono a monocle monocle anyways he's bushy y'all were right a lot of fedoras [Music] smoking some hookah i love that look at his little bow tie he's a little cutie thank you but you have a drink with me no oh i forgot you never drink with any i don't have another please business why doesn't he drink with his customers how do i give you any thought i probably wouldn't but you know rick i have many a friend in casablanca but somehow just because you despise me you are the only one i trust i mean that makes sense i guess if you'll forgive me i'll share my good luck with your little just a moment i don't trust this guy is he setting him up to get arrested because he has the letters of transit when you are blue just knock on wood oh he hid it in the piano that's smart that's smart because it's definitely a setup what do you want for sam i don't buy or sell human beings good for you look at her she's gorgeous that shirt the hair the earrings where were you last night that's so long ago i don't remember i see you tonight i never make plans that far ahead i like rick out of my high regard for you we're staging it here it will amuse your customers our entertainment's enough we'll have dinner in a show i just paid out 20 i'd like to get it back make it 10. i'm only a poor corrupt official i can't wait to see somebody get arrested that's going to be fun yes will you please come with us certainly nice and that's why he gave rick the transit papers because he knew he was going to get arrested he's really trying to escape you go shoot oh my god do something you must tell me gonna risk his business for you buddy don't get it twisted rick knows where his bread is buttered and it ain't with you three times he slipped through our fingers in paris he continued his activities we intend not to let it happen again you know what they say fourth time's the charm oh my god she's so pretty is sam interested in her or does he know something that we don't know yet oh just everybody else is seeing how pretty she is okay okay okay victor i feel somehow we shouldn't stay here wait that's victor he's the bad guy they're not looking at her they're looking at him oh yes i'm very interested what does that mean the little game we play they put it on the bill i tear up the bill it is very convenient [Music] all right girl i love your tassels on your guitar that's fun like look at her profile she is perfect i found another one of god's favorites so how do her and sam know each other i missed it yeah you missed them by like five minutes surprised you didn't hear the gunshots two champagne cocktails please yes what is a champagne cocktail that sounds delicious some of the old sunsets this one so they go way back for old time's sake i don't know what you mean miss elsa oh my god her teeth are perfect her nose is perfect her eyes her hair and when two lovers move you okay girl i thought i told you never to play oh i don't know why it took me so long to get to this realization but here we are now finally i can't get over you two she was asking about you earlier rick in a way that made me extremely jealous it's so awkward at this table yes i don't wish to be the one to say it but it's late his last note is who is laszlo not catching up to the fact that elsa and rick got like a little thing oh i really can't say though i saw him quite often in paris saw him quite often i bet you did girl i bet you did oh man rick's torn up about it also i would not be sitting alone in that dark ass room ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future no you ever going to bed no no sir i'm staying right here sam's really trying to save you rick i would listen to sam women ain't nothing but trouble oh just a little something i'll stop it you know what i want to hear show me the memory that you're feeling show me i want to see you two in love show me they look perfect together i'm not gonna cry but it is very sweet is looking at you kid that's this movie i've heard that quote before that's one thing i wish would bring back it's like normalized dancing again he's dead what it's a very romantic answer for him sorry there's like this war footage and i'm sitting over here smiling at their little love story how do you pour champagne where it doesn't bubble he's looking at you kid oh we just said it so we're gonna say it again and that's why it's a classic quote got it the whole world crumbling we picked this time to fall in love yeah it's pretty bad timing but timing's a what was romantic until she spilt her champagne richard i cannot go with you ever see you again you must ask not ask why i just believe that i love you oh why yeah and that's when he became an ultra hard ass because he got his heart broken by elsa oh she for real didn't show up no look at that scarf that's fabulous wow rick she tried to explain and you're busy being a heartbroken you know the leader of the underground movement in paris in prague in brussels in amsterdam you know oh sell somebody else out for your exit visa you would find the conversation try for one-sided their socks i guess now you know how serious they are another visa problem has come up show her in who is it already how do you know it's her there's something i want to talk over with you these tall pants and short ties i don't like that oh no they're going to run into each other again ah did i say 700 francs you can have it for 200. small discount that's a huge discount why did you come back to tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station well if you would have let her finish last night you would have known that if we leave it that way maybe we'll remember those days not casablanca oh my heart no you say victor lazler is my husband and was even when i knew you in paris the plot thickened i thought he was dead if i had to stay and there were only visa for one would you take it yeah he would absolutely yes i would see you this is a dangerous place full of fighters invites us everywhere thanks everybody you mean to tell me he didn't feel that man getting at his buddha cheek julie you are getting to be your best customer you are getting to be your best customer that's hilarious to celebrate our leaving for america tomorrow yay good for you i thought you would ask because i brought the good friendly and the girl's glass good for him for being prepared my husband is with me too yes well caprano's getting broad-minded again so witty how long have you been married eight weeks oh congratulations and he is so kind he wants to help us yes i'll bet help go back to bulgaria oh but if you knew what it means to us to leave europe to get to america i don't know girl that's you gotta live with your own choices on that one play as time goes by i believe that's your favorite tune [Music] ah the tension kills me the tension kills me okay so he helps the deserving people i guess how are we doing tonight well a couple of thousands less than i thought they would yeah don't give it away girl they watch him i'll see you in the morning thank you so much okay so the captain is also giving people exit visas so he's not completely on germany germany's side yet carl's just trying to help rick you're going through it but i'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde and it'll make me very happy if she loses that that's dirty you know what it means to the work to the lives of thousands and thousands he's gonna leave elsa there must be some reason why you won't let me have them there is i suggest that you ask your wife oh threw elsa right under the bus i mean [Music] you're not as good as sam but whatever makes you happy i guess [Music] and then everybody else in yay good for you but everybody's having such a good time yes much to go to time close me up on what ground i'm shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here you're winning sir oh thank you very much [Laughter] observe that in casablanca human life is cheap you had to make a choice girl and i would choose rick did he give him a reason he suggested i ask you yeah girl you know were you alone in paris yes victor i was i know how it is oh yeah she was lonely i thought he said were you alone and i was like so that's why she said he was dead because she really didn't think he was because he was in the concentration camp of course i'd be careful so he's probably gonna die tonight is she gonna go see rick i would talk about a late night booty call richard i had to see it was richard again we're back in paris he is so sheisty i love it fighting for anything anymore except myself i'm the only cause i'm interested in that's what heartbreak will do to you girl you did that to him you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth i wouldn't believe why don't you tell him she has a gun i also didn't come to play all right i'll make it easier for you she won't no she won't do that ah she's pretty even when she cries uh can't relate and if you need proof go watch fried green tomatoes you knew how much i loved you well tell him how much i still love you oh they kiss it why weren't you honest with me why did you keep your marriage a secret it wasn't mice well she didn't keep him a secret she said that she had a man but he was dead all except one he won't have you oh they're back together oh i love this so i wonder if laszlo is gonna get the the transit papers and then he's gonna leave elsa like and it just all magically works out like that oh wait i forgot that laszlo doesn't know that elsa's there if we stop breathing we'll die we stop fighting our enemies the world will die good point it's perhaps a strange circumstance we both should be in love with the same woman oh so he does know we use the letters to take her away from casablanca do you love her that much yes i love her that much wow i didn't expect that from laszlo you're not very subtle but you are effective i i get the point i respect that you get something really big something that would chuck them in a concentration camp for years quite a feather in your cap wouldn't it oh would you really do that to him though but you were never interested in anyone she isn't just any woman i see he was in love with her before you don't know his story and by the way call off your watch dogs when you let him go i don't want him around this afternoon i'm taking no chances louie not even with you i mean telling him your full plan isn't that kind of taking a chance on him be rick's without them well so long you're not gonna take sam with you but sam was with you in paris i'll never be the same without you ricky i know what you mean but i've already spoken to ferrari you'll still win at roulette is everything man this is when elaborate set up quite often we'll tell him at the airport he hasn't told him that he's stealing his wife not so fast louie nobody's gonna be arrested not for a while what i didn't see this coming under the circumstances i will sit down good idea gun is pointed right at your heart that is my least vulnerable spot i wasn't ready for this plot twist i had no idea airport huh this is captain reynolds speaking there were two letters of trash and he called the german sheriff guy it all adds up to one thing you're getting on that plane with victor where you belong no what oh my god what what about us we'll always have paris but she's gonna miss you for forever just when i think the plaque couldn't get any thicker and the german officer is coming i would advise you not to interfere i was willing to shoot captain rhino and i'm willing to shoot oh suck it oh my god oh my god [Music] okay major strut has been shot round up the usual suspects and he protects rick wow i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship that's another famous quote it's over let's talk about it oh my god that ending what an amazing ending there was so many double croc oh my god it was wow the relationship between rick and the french officer louie they're best friends at least now they are i'm very sad that elsa and rick didn't end up together but it had to be hold on but it had to be that way so they could go to america and continue to fight the good fight and now rick's getting a little all inclusive vacation to lay under the radar for a while to lay low and he gets to keep his bar sam stays employed carl stays employed that's really a happy ending for everybody except the german officer who got shot but like you know history bad things were happening this movie had everything and i've heard that quote here's looking at you kid and i feel like we'll always have paris is another memorable quote and then i believe this is am i sweating that bad oh lord i believe this is the start of a beautiful friendship if i'm missing other any other famous quotes please let me know in the comments it had action it had romance it had suspense it had double cross and two time and no gooders but also double cross and two time and good gooders hold on which one was humphrey brogart i i hope it was rick because rick's a cutie humphrey bogart was rigged and let me tell you something humphrey bogart could get it that was such a good movie it's just a classic hollywood feel elsa was beautiful rick amazingly handsome and it was funny that's another thing i haven't touched on it was so witty the dialogue was so sharp and funny and i had a great time beans are we gonna have to get our hvac redone if you keep sitting on the ductwork i'm gonna give casablanca five out of five stars it had a little bit of everything wit humor gun violence two timing a cutie as the lead male acuity as the lead woman i couldn't guess the ending the plot got so thick i couldn't breathe oh the tension the tension between rick and elsa oh the timing was never right for them and you know what they say timing is a i'm so glad i got to it thank you so much for watching like subscribe stick around links to
