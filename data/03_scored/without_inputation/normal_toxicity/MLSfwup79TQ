hello everybody,0.04065282
and welcome back to robert's reviews before we get started i wanted to announce that my niece is being a little too loud today,0.062264014
so you might hear her in the background,0.089120656
so i apologize for that soon it will not matter because i will be not living here,0.24176106
so look forward to that i know i am um,0.08331488
but uh for those of you who don't know uh once again i am in a film club at oneonta suny oneonta and uh so this is my last review for them until next semester but uh they had me watch singing in the rain [Applause] sand of the rain was released in 1952 which is a long time ago it was written by betty condon and adolf green and directed by stanley donan and gene kelly uh quick little quick little fun fact first of all this is a non-spoiler review although it's singing in the rain,0.09137739
you probably know it already um,0.073852144
i was in um,0.060503326
i was in a production of singing in the rain,0.08170613
uh five years ago i played young cosmo,0.11139636
so if you remember from the first scene of the film when he when gene kelly and them are going up to the premiere,0.059591636
they have a little flashback sequence which shows don and uh don and cosmo uh in their violin dance and stuff at vaudeville and stuff and i did that for my production and i did a bunch of other stuff and stage crew and was also like literally stage crew for the show um,0.10386582
so it's a lot of fun uh so i've seen the show dozens of times um because i wasn't on stage,0.13936837
too long for this one um but boy is it long it's it's not long here,0.18975034
it's it really isn't but it's long for the show on stage,0.07963375
so it's even longer,0.07872933
so this felt like a nice little breezy dream in comparison to the show,0.24042201
but um essentially what happens is we're set in the world where there's black and white movies and they're only there,0.10987895
there's no sound right,0.08772989
that's ridiculous why we didn't have sound to a movie um,0.6050989
and it's about the invention of the sound that can go with the movies,0.05623864
and basically what happens,0.09127925
we have don lockwood we have lena lamont and lena lamotte talks a lot like this right which sounds ridiculous um and the issue is that they want to produce talkies right which are movies that can talk which is normal for us now but not back then and essentially what happens is they're freaking out because they can't have lena lamont in the film because she's going to sound ridiculous right,0.46899027
so what they do is,0.053479806
they dub the voice with somebody else,0.2426526
kathy selden who is this young attractive lady that don falls in love with and uh a lot of issues ensue particularly when liana lamont finds out and she gets all mad and tries to stop it excuse me uh but overall it's it's a fun little musical it really is and while it is a good musical,0.15483437
there are some issues,0.06975196
i don't talk about one big issue,0.09882227
right,0.04255815
now which was the long musical set says i stutter,0.031930458
i apologize sequence at the end of the film uh where we have this song it's like broadway rhythm,0.06766306
i think it's called um and boy is it long,0.09977569
it was like literally like 20 minutes long and i'm sitting here like it has nothing at all to do with the plot of the movie at all it really doesn't and it just kind of felt weighed down by like oh well we already wrote the music so we got to do it anyway,0.07706636
so in another movie somehow and honestly it just it didn't work very well i was prepared to give this a really good review and then that scene and i just i i tried to let one scene ruin it but it's a 20 minute scene like it's at least 10 minutes,0.110775515
i might be over exaggerating like it's 20,0.0821353
but it's at least like 10 minutes long and i'm like we didn't need it and the music wasn't that good either,0.081969544
that's another thing i do want to talk about,0.07359809
i don't really care for the music very much,0.11037086
here,0.053441145
there's sometimes i love like make them laugh,0.11644398
it's on my favorite songs or any musical um,0.057927735
and i do like good morning and singing in the rain is always a good one,0.050107263
but like the rest of it kind of felt meh and even in the musical there's a lot of extra stuff like um what's wrong with me which little lamont sings and a bunch of like that that i really enjoyed that wasn't in the film um which is good because the film was pushing with that 20 minute long dance sequence,0.06144854
i had nothing to do with the plot of the film at all um,0.074059844
but the acting was really strong here,0.06914467
that's like one thing that i really did like about the show was it is very well acted,0.099996135
i'm very impressed with with gene kelly here and of course um uh debbie reynolds and gene hagen and donald o'connor all of them are great,0.44753098
so let's go ahead and start talking about them because i think they're definitely the the attraction,0.06301772
that brings people to see this movie gene kelly as don lockwood i've heard working with him is is the worst thing you could ever do in your life um but to his credit he's very good,0.4245363
he really is um,0.07242403
he's really good at singing but his acting in particular is really really strong,0.10493825
he plays this kind of an arrogant actor who has started to realize that you know acting is kind of weird anyways,0.66832614
maybe maybe i shouldn't be as arrogant as i have been and like all that fun jazz that ensues in the movie really just it was great,0.4471729
i i did like his portrayal in this movie uh and i haven't seen any of them i think but maybe i'll look into looking at some other stuff maybe down,0.13537
the line we'll do a you know a series of him,0.071280815
i mean it is the 50s,0.06516006
so it was a long time ago but uh i do need to catch up on some old film noir stuff donald o'connor as cosmo brown cosmos my favorite character,0.124674484
i am a little biased because i was young cosmo in the show but he's also like he's really funny and he has that that make him laugh sequence that i really like um it really is great he like broke his ankle or something doing that and he had to do it like three times and he was he didn't like it but he did it anyway because he was supposed to and honestly it was really fun,0.10299177
and i'm really happy,0.054145392
they did the way they did it my goal in life one day is to one day recreate that sequence um that'd be a lot of fun like the exact sequence,0.072400905
i think that'd be really really fun debbie reynolds as kathy selden kathy selden is the young attractive girl that don falls in love with and she can sing and she can act and all that stuff but she's not on the big screen because she kind of thinks it's dumb,0.71521074
but then she realizes oh it might actually be fun to do that so that she does,0.111611366
and that's really the romantic part of the movie and i liked it,0.09246289
i think it was good,0.08142637
i think it was a good issue to have right where don likes kathy but kathy doesn't really like dawn too much or at least,0.066296086
she's not letting on that she does and it works here,0.24478094
because it's like one of the first times that it ever happened right because you watch movies now and it's like oh that's like every day,0.10748836
but like this is like the first time like it's one of the first times it's the 50s um but it worked,0.059150368
well it was it was a good excuse to have romance and i hate bad excuses from that's like,0.24171783
oh well it's a movie so it's gotta have a bunch of romance in it right,0.10992471
not necessarily,0.049961966
it doesn't have to i got this director's chair okay that's pretty cool um,0.13542771
but like it's interesting that they did that because it was like the first time like that's like basically an original idea right,0.059572697
there think it was really well done,0.055163838
and i did like it quite a bit and we have jean hagen as lena lamont lean on the monster great i hate her with a passion don't get me wrong,0.5876557
i hate her with a passion she's annoying as hell to listen to she's like ow but donny you're in love and it's like oh my god please he doesn't like you but she was great,0.71783084
i really that's the point of her characters to hate her so well done overall,0.5974957
i think it's a really really good movie,0.101219356
i really do i think it's fun,0.08223601
and it's it's it's a good movie to watch and to pay attention to um for at least the hour and 20 minutes and then of course it's like,0.048530046
oh but here's a really long dance number you get to listen to hee hee and it's like you just could have not had that and it would have been great,0.18606295
and i do have some issues with directing,0.11551459
we're not going to talk about it because it's it's hard to pinpoint,0.08789345
what is directing,0.05433402
what is acting at this point um and especially considering gene kelly did both of them,0.116949804
uh but there were just some issues that i'd like all right take for example the singing of the rain dance,0.080508254
that was really well done right really really good and they had other things that just felt way too structured right saying the rain felt like loose and gene kelly could just like run around and dance,0.067229666
and do awesome stuff with dance involved,0.074002266
and then do other things like say the good morning sequence which felt a little too over the top for me even though it's a good song,0.05069487
it's a little too over the top for me um,0.069557466
and of course the 20 minute long dancing because in the movie which is so freaking long it's unbelievable um,0.470121
i can't express my hatred for that sequence enough i was sitting here on my bed like watching this movie at like 10 at night and i'm like oh my goodness,0.35032633
i just want to go to sleep,0.12355374
now like i was totally engaged in the movie and they're like oh but this,0.09108988
and i was like why um,0.11125431
so that happened,0.054855056
but overall a really really fun movie if you guys want to give it a shot and take it take a watch it's in it's on hbo max um and just be wary that towards the end of the film it doesn't get a whole lot better,0.09136569
the ending is really fun,0.108611666
i do like the ending after the sequence is really good um,0.10325798
but the sequence itself is not very good um but i'm gonna go ahead and give singing in the rain an a minus really really fun movie it's a really old movie if you guys like old movies and you guys like musicals is one for you if you guys want something a recommendation for a newer musical that just came out a week away is now available on netflix it is a christian musical technically but it's a fun musical nonetheless i do have a review on it on the channel and uh honestly it's a movie that i've been watching sometimes for falsely because it's such a really good uplifting uh musical and it's not the best movie of all time no but it's fun to listen to and the soundtrack is nice,0.16158783
and the story is fun,0.047441468
so it's a fun show to watch and listen to,0.05625712
