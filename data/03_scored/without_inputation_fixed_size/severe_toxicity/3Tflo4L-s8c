hi my name is an angel and today I will be reviewing the movie ladybird,0.10917925
a 20-17 coming-of-age story of a young girl going through high school and dealing with,0.05959979
emotions family drama hormones all of that it was written and directed by Greta Gerwig,0.05287079
oh go girl I think this is like her debut and she was nominated at,0.059773404
the Oscars if you're like me you're not really into coming-of-age movies I've mentioned before,0.117563225
that it's like somebody moving a rock from one place to another where you see,0.03563256
a tiny evolution in the character it doesn't mean much to me that being said,0.01070613
I really enjoy Lady Bird I didn't expect to seeing the trailer and hearing about,0.041863333
it it didn't seem like I would be able to relate to it first of,0.012488823
all not only was it a coming-of-age story but it's also about this young girl,0.06439576
and the dynamic in a home with a mother that I could not relate to,0.018885229
are identify with because of cultural differences so I really thought I would just sit,0.030903768
there and be like oh she has nothing to complain about she's just gonna be,0.065056294
why me and the typical distressed teenager that were so used to seeing on TV,0.04029217
luckily I was wrong it's a bit of that but not that much this movie,0.040418554
is really about being a teenage girl being so wrapped up in your own life,0.23958041
and your journey to self-discovery that you don't realize how you are such a small,0.23141822
part of a larger scale called the world and how your actions can really affect,0.020674573
the people around you I was once a teenage girl and I know that for,0.06387226
a fact I was terrible I hope to never have a teenage daughter of my,0.12571372
own you are so much so in your head and dealing with so many things,0.23434506
especially if you're in a kind of toxic home environment that only adds layers to,0.043936044
it and a toxic school environment where you're being bullied or ostracized or whatever you,0.0617776
don't understand yourself and you're comparing yourself to others and you're just trying to figure,0.07689191
out who am i who are my role models do I look to the Bible,0.07582229
do I look to TV do I look to magazines do I look to my,0.038977765
own mother I don't know none of these examples seem to fit me and there's,0.09445741
just an inner frustration that fuels a lot of your actions if you're that type,0.037905492
of teenage girl not all obviously are that way but Lady Bird is and that's,0.11928273
what we see Lady Bird aka Christine played by Saoirse Ronan I hope I got,0.058518864
her name right is your rebellious teenager who is having an identity crisis in high,0.07743536
school she is also in a Catholic high school I grew up with a Catholic,0.0206473
mother I went to church it's an inflexible environment for a girl to really discover,0.066425905
who she is Saoirse did such a great job at portraying this girl so naturally,0.15832502
you could see her being frustrated and angsty and wanting to be loved and wanting,0.23130867
to be understood and not knowing who she is but she's got that cockiness that,0.30384806
young girls have like I know everything I've got this whole world figured out and,0.23692839
she's careless sometimes with her words and doesn't realize that they actually carry weights especially,0.033621706
with her parents for example and college is her Savior her saving grace we cannot,0.034740545
wait to go to college and leave her world behind and I can totally relate,0.121098675
to that feeling what makes this movie so sweet and endearing is the relationships between,0.03428822
all of the characters especially as they relate to Lady Bird Laurie Metcalf plays the,0.013512541
mother and she plays her so so well there are layers of complexity between a,0.04033208
mother that is reaching out for her daughter but also pushing her away because her,0.14833263
daughter consistently hurts her she doesn't always know how to take it without taking it,0.18008317
personally and understanding that she's just a teenager she's gonna say harsh things she's the,0.095989995
matriarch holding this family together she has so much on her shoulders a very demanding,0.15069403
job as a nurse financial hardship she's trying to get her daughter through college she's,0.08208765
also the spouse of a person dealing with depression and who has been for years,0.042370867
all of these things are super heavy for one person to carry on their shoulders,0.07021412
and that's what a lot of mothers out there do and then she has a,0.04382895
deal with her daughters and teenage news a daughter only sees her relationship with her,0.08961554
mother so she believes that everything her mother is feeling the way her mother is,0.12846026
a moaning it's all because of her and that's why the relationship can be often,0.24239212
combative and that's why she can come to conclusions like do you even like me,0.06121818
I felt so bad for my own mother when I watched the thinking about everything,0.11245395
she went through that was behind closed doors you know you don't know as a,0.04975108
kid all the layers of your parents lives but I'm not saying that the parents,0.16124052
are blameless I mean her mother's words are really harsh sometimes and as the female,0.20684084
role model for a daughter you were supposed to build your child up not cut,0.07573116
her down in such petty ways a lot of moms are like that they don't,0.12620662
realize it that all their compliments are backhanded oh I didn't know that you were,0.046149775
capable of such heights thank you helps with self-esteem the mom mentions that she had,0.032784242
a hard mother of her own so she kind of learned to be not so,0.18824764
caring that way it reminded me of Tonya Harding's mother in I Tania who also,0.053522673
had the excuse of I didn't like my mother so get over it there are,0.07395179
slight similarities between the two mothers but also vast differences I would say the only,0.06958952
similarity is that you see these mothers that are working so hard to create a,0.03712656
financially stable as much as possible environment for their families for their kids but at,0.012032507
the cost of an emotional relationship a bond time spent with these kids with these,0.02388874
teenagers especially and also at the cost of their own personal happiness they feel an,0.021748845
obligation to do certain things and that may be Noble but their unhappiness is kind,0.044265974
of heavy and kids aren't stupid they notice these kind of things they can tell,0.3340312
when mom's not alright and it affects them it was also interesting to see the,0.07351477
father/daughter relationship as opposed to the mother-daughter and father was played by Tracy Letts and,0.056424867
for quite frankly I loved him why wasn't he nominated for Best Supporting character at,0.021370355
the Oscars is beyond me he is such a sweet caring father he's gentle he's,0.042043597
patient human and warm and present for his family and going through his own things,0.03691104
you know his own struggles his own life issues and I love how he did,0.046731148
want to interfere he did not want to come in between his daughter's relationship with,0.24560344
her mother he seemed to respect boundaries although he tried to in subtle ways push,0.124169834
them closer together and help them with the gaps in communication that would exist he,0.04580122
was an exceptional father and we're so used to seeing either absent fathers or angry,0.048079476
fathers were bumbling Homer Simpson's of fathers it was a real person that's what I,0.22778204
love about this movie every character is a full person not just uni-dimensional like we're,0.042986162
used to seeing not just accessories to the main characters life behind them there's a,0.03487292
whole other movie beanie Feldstein plays Julie ladybirds best friend and I absolutely adored their,0.07151057
friendship it's so innocent and pure and silly they have an arc in their friendship,0.21900107
that is not uncommon at all it's actually refreshing to see that kind of arc,0.024380976
where sometimes in the journey to self-discovery we lose touch with our childhood friends or,0.035919253
very close friends they really had such a sweet friendship I loved it so so,0.046589464
much I loved the nun played by Lois Smith at the school she was so,0.031503763
sweet she had such a great soul and a great sense of humor this movie,0.03881679
is not making fun of Catholics or showing them in the typical stick up the,0.22231169
but super serious super judgmental she was warm she was exactly what you would want,0.044626504
a religious person to be tolerant light hearted almost like a therapist who can see,0.036869798
through your bowl and see the real you loved it and her line about love,0.029318634
is paying attention Greta mind-blown I had never thought of love that way and ever,0.042750023
since I've been trying to pay attention to the things I'm paying attention to and,0.018269934
the people I'm paying attention to to see if I am actually expressing my love,0.033927027
for people and things properly and when you boil it down that's basically what Lady,0.24847718
Bird and all teenagers want they want attention they want that love they want their,0.027420865
parents to notice them their friends to notice that they want to be seen and,0.027575852
what's interesting is that ladybirds parents do what a lot of parents do they work,0.12232794
really hard to create a safe environment for their kids and it's in this kind,0.029746348
of environment that Lady Bird actually has the luxury of time to overthink her life,0.13246201
her actions herself whereas there are a lot of kids around the world who are,0.08688828
illegally working also contributing to the family's finances or taking care of siblings or dealing,0.050537992
with situations that a kid should not be dealing with they don't have that privilege,0.07386132
of being angsty and broken and sorrowful they just so traumatized that they're just barreling,0.2317454
through life there is a privilege to being an angry teenager who can just mouth,0.12316407
off without the fear of repercussions ladybirds boyfriend Danny reminded me of the whole call,0.035887323
me by your name plots and again the movie portrays him with such love and,0.03828664
care and sweetness and in their dynamic they're both going through very different things and,0.028429285
Lady Bird takes his of evolution personally and she makes about herself because I what,0.055598043
teenagers do but then they have a sweet moment where she actually realizes oh I'm,0.042096145
in his story I'm in his narrative right now I need to be there for,0.029060543
him as a friend speaking of call me by your name we got team with,0.024533303
deshyla made makes an appearance yes Kyle and his group of friends I know those,0.028296247
kids they just are so blase blase I call them they think they're woke but,0.40364614
they're really just extra and those kids are usually like the cool kid that's cool,0.02982883
the people that just don't care and they're just themselves and they're so chill and,0.09127849
emotionless and just like yeah we do bad things I can so relate ladybird wanting,0.1252195
to be like them being approved and accepted by the cool kids makes you cool,0.013561099
and I like that she had the opportunity to get close enough to see the,0.032789562
truth that these kids are usually dealing with a lot also back home and it's,0.016744003
harder than them in a way they actually have a usually very absentee parents wealthy,0.08376658
but absentee I'm just gonna reference the last scene without going too much into it,0.038264025
but this movie did remind me of when I went away to college and how,0.03834584
happy and emotionless I was I couldn't wait to leave and how emotional my mom,0.21279691
and the tears and I was just like why are you crying I'll see you,0.067055166
in a few months I'll come back for the holidays I'm just excited to be,0.029260764
alone living on my own in a city with other teenagers my age going to,0.115812466
school and being crazy and having access to things i never had access to before,0.12597115
but over time coming and going leaving home evolutions in my relationships with my own,0.034386
mother made the departures a little harder every time until you get to the point,0.10886462
where you really do cry when you leave home luckily I got to that place,0.042750023
so when I was watching momma McPherson I could really feel her heaviness and running,0.17190342
away from that pain I thought it was nice that they also showed us a,0.04639656
little more and the last scene was sweet this movie really is kind of like,0.036374904
a love letter to mother-daughter relationships I'm so glad I enjoyed it and I really,0.07076756
hope that a lot of people can open their hearts to it and see what,0.027903123
happens it's enjoyable it's sweet it's funny it's consistently entertaining I never got bored and,0.034649417
that's saying a lot for a coming-of-age movie so yeah I recommend it Lady Bird,0.15364146
