was going on with this movie and maybe even catch a couple things that you,0.14671515

don't care about spoilers or if you have seen us and you really just don't,0.09799829
feel like paying to go see it all over again to get all this stuff,0.06912454
sit back relax and let's get into it we start off the movie informing us,0.10736604
that below the United States there are thousands of miles of underground tunnels and routes,0.14606366
that we just simply have no idea about what they are where they lead or,0.0980634
anything like that this sets up the groundwork for the movie to let us know,0.11011459
that something or anything could be happening underground without anyone being the wiser in the,0.107677065
very next scene we see a TV on with the young Adelaide watching we'll just,0.053565096
call her a d4 short for eagle-eyed viewers you might notice that young Adi is,0.17840862
using some scissors to cut up some paper we then see a hands across America,0.23967034
commercial which will play an interesting part later on into this story in the next,0.03858096
scene we're told that it's the year 1986 where young Adi is at a carnival,0.06393636
with her parents on the Santa Cruz Beach at this carnival Adi starts to wander,0.11207285
off and we get our first glimpse of a man holding a sign with the,0.07591507
Bible verse Jeremiah 11 11 don't worry we'll come back and revisit that Adi continues,0.19166851
to wander further away from her parents and goes into a Hall of Mirrors while,0.06761034
inside the power goes out and as she tries to find the exit she bumps,0.108857214
into another little girl that looks exactly like her the film cuts to a room,0.18518196
full of white bunnies locked in their cages don't worry we'll definitely come back to,0.53490317
this - as we fast forward to present day we join Addie now all grown,0.07080246
up with her family driving to their summer home for their vacation her husband Gabe,0.06405818
announces to the family that they will be going to the Santa Cruz Beach to,0.043685578
have some fun as Addie thinks back about the Santa Cruz Beach we start to,0.08822133
see some flashbacks we cut back to the doctor's office with a DS family and,0.11144364
the doctor is suggesting the he might have post-traumatic stress disorder see ever since that,0.1310618
event in the Hall of Mirrors addy hasn't talked at all so the doctor prescribed,0.05059829
to Addie's parents that they should encourage her to do more creative activities like drawing,0.05673032
or dancing with the hope that she'll eventually start talking again despite trying to convince,0.09311354
her husband not to go to Santa Cruz Beach Addie reluctantly agrees to go anyway,0.15374602
Gabe shows off his new boats of the family that he just acquired as the,0.11399954
family drives to the beach they pass an ambulance tending to a dead body turns,0.4460155
out that the same man from 1986 who was holding that Bible verse had passed,0.16713727
away the family meets up with their family friends at the beach and Addie is,0.07975813
still a bit on edge while she's there her younger son Jason goes to the,0.11237919
bathroom on the beach and sees a weird figure standing and looking off into the,0.0717538
distance with bloody hands Addie can't find her son Jason and she starts to panic,0.5559122
after finding Jason her family decides to leave the beach soon after Addie confesses to,0.060373224
her husband about the day in the Hall of Mirrors and little girl in the,0.1727204
mirror that she saw Gabe of course isn't understanding the real issue and brushes it,0.12722372
off that is until Jason lets the family know that there's a strange family outside,0.06951596
on their driveway Gabe goes out to confront them and the strange group just stands,0.06934816
there Addie calls the police but of course we all know that the police in,0.15246072
horror movies well they're pretty much useless most of the time the strange group manages,0.55737215
to break into the residence thanks to a hidden key and begins to hold the,0.053300824
family hostage it's at this point that we all realize that this group are actually,0.1552822
clones of the main family of course these doppelgangers have some differences the leader of,0.18749689
the group who looks exactly like Addie is called red red tells a story about,0.11022274
a girl who had a shadow in the story the girl would eat warm cooked,0.24568877
food while the shadow was forced to eat raw bloody rabbits during Christmas the girl,0.5558463
would get soft cushy toys while the shadow would get sharp coal toys that would,0.13284823
cut her the girl would marry a handsome prince while the shadow was forced to,0.41925812
be with another man mainly because that man was connected to the prince red continues,0.09043718
to recount that when the shadow had to give birth to her the daughter came,0.1017568
out to be a monster and when the second child was born the girl had,0.43379718
a c-section while the shadow had to cut herself in order to give birth to,0.29580215
her son the shadow named her son Pluto and said he was born to love,0.2089805
fire now red is obviously telling a story about herself and Addie with red being,0.1391034
the shadow and Addie being the girl in the story red continues to reiterate her,0.22939405
hatred for Addie and that her resentment has been building up for a long time,0.432639
red also makes a very interesting confession when she says that there was a day,0.068651184
that she realized that she was being tested by God Gabe interrupts red to ask,0.08909576
just what is it that they want and who are they red replies we're Americans,0.11453282
this is probably the point in the movie where we get the most clear and,0.06151541
obvious social commentary I will absolutely come back to this and this will probably be,0.079987414
the most important theme to understand in the whole movie but let's get back to,0.0688309
the story so chaos ensues as red has Andy handcuffed to the table and the,0.12745243
rest of the family is separated by their doubles we get a moment where something,0.09082216
is revealed to us when we see Pluto and Jason in the closet they appear,0.15509945
to be playing a sort of game and what is shown here is that both,0.03644095
of them are still connected together this will prove to be an important part in,0.06361272
the story later as well anyway so the family continues to fight against their individual,0.15167584
evil copies and after either killing some or evading some of them they eventually reunite,0.5884029
on Gabe's boat they head on over to their family friend's home to find refuge,0.15208296
however to their surprise their friends have already been murdered by their own evil doubles,0.48076108
- addy is captured by the evil friend doubles and held hostage Addie's children come,0.34497377
in and save her by whooping the hell out of those evil doubles as the,0.5069332
family regains control of the house they see on the news that this event seems,0.1415072
to be going on almost on a national level doubles are all dressed in red,0.08446508
with scissors in hand and starting to join hands once the family starts to realize,0.06578603
how dangerous this situation is getting they all decide to just hop in the car,0.09403939
and get out of town unfortunately they forget the actual car keys so Adi goes,0.13777924
back into the house to grab him as she notices one of the evil twins,0.46645495
that she thought she killed that she thought was dead wasn't actually dead because you,0.51755136
know it wouldn't be a horror movie without having someone you thought was dead actually,0.296847
not be dead so that they can do a nice little jump scare later on,0.32914877
anyway Eddie finds this evil twin and goes ahead and just kills him off as,0.68346965
this is happening her son Jason walks in and notices the gruesome mess that his,0.24835758
mother has left as Adi and her family go to the car to make a,0.25143933
run for it they're met up with their daughters evil twin named hombre after an,0.31089434
interesting game of chicken they throw her off the car and into the woods where,0.35726255
she's impaled and left to die Adi runs out of the car to go check,0.553122
on her and instead of trying to kill her off it would appear that Adi,0.8050628
has a moment of sympathy as this evil doppelganger starts to die as they travel,0.44341588
back to their home they noticed that Pluto has set their family car on fire,0.24806447
Adi gets out of the car to confront Pluto but Jason realizes that the whole,0.07620317
thing is a trap going back to an earlier point Jason recalls that Pluto and,0.12960939
him are still tethered or connected and uses this connection to make Pluto walk backwards,0.16951351
into the fire and die once again we get another moment where Adi does not,0.46564537
seem necessarily ready to hurry up and kill Pluto but instead she hesitates and has,0.6850139
yet another moment of sympathy for the dying doppelganger unfortunately there seem to be another,0.15396065
layer to this trap because Redd was waiting and took Jason down into the underground,0.21081641
area where all the clones were from Adi goes solo on this mission deep down,0.103313945
into the bowels of this underground area Jordan Peele gets some nice credit here for,0.10324647
setting up the atmosphere with this hellish setting it's kind of reminiscent of a sort,0.17127153
of dissension into Dante's hell mixed in with some Freddy Krueger boiler room scenes -,0.3621866
Adi reaches the classroom where red is cutting up paper into figures that are holding,0.13009822
hands during this confrontation and standoff Redd finally gives us a whole lot of details,0.09428107
and clues as to everything that's been going on so let's break some of it,0.078752585
down red tells Adi that all of the clones down there or the tethered were,0.13978602
just as human as the people above she continues by saying that humans built this,0.15973842
place and that she believes that the humans figured out how to copy the body,0.19187425
but not the soul furthermore she believed that it is the soul that is shared,0.1270801
by the two bodies which is why the clones are tethered to the people above,0.08767641
read then continues to say that the humans that created the tethered were trying to,0.0886849
control the people above so in a way I guess we could kind of think,0.15079036
of the tethered people as kind of like human voodoo dolls now this idea of,0.31089434
having people controlled from below goes back to a one-liner from a Dee's daughter Zora,0.19079408
earlier in the movie she casually mentions that she had heard that the government has,0.06413508
been putting fluoride in the water and using that as a means to control people's,0.043639906
minds while the government involvement is not actually confirmed in the movie it's the best,0.06206536
that we can go off of right now but anyway let's get back to the,0.08001946
story red continues on to say that the humans who created the tethered failed in,0.19092691
their goal to create human puppets and they abandoned them with no direction the tethered,0.31488487
went crazy red says that both her and Adi were born special and this is,0.48168975
the part of the movie where we start to see the camera go back and,0.09449906
forth from the above world and to the below tunnels with all the tethered people,0.22845308
mimicking the actions of those above red tells Adi that she believes that God brought,0.13891436
them together that faithful night when they walked into the Hall of Mirrors red confesses,0.055944696
to Adi how she's never stopped thinking about Adi and how Adi could have taken,0.19709696
red with her to the above world after a couple of years red tells Adi,0.13512634
that a miracle happened when Addie was learning how to dance in the world above,0.09013656
since they were both tethered together red also began to learn how to dance down,0.1261207
below and took that as being a miracle from God the other tethered people saw,0.139932
that red was very different and viewed red as their new leader and Savior so,0.06866765
red planned for years and years after so much obsessing not only to kill Adi,0.5596823
but as she said she also wanted to make a statement to the entire world,0.06722595
red wanted to lead a revolution and she was gonna use the Hands Across America,0.24378358
ideal as the basis at this point both red and addy start fighting each other,0.09375033
with red using the precision and agility that she learned from Addie's dancing in order,0.07046537
to stab her repeatedly of course like any classic villain red gets a little bit,0.7269403
too overconfident toying with her prey and Addie is able to stab her and choke,0.7681549
her to death Addie finds her son Jason hiding in a locker and they all,0.44278395
get into an ambulance to drive to safety as the family is driving away in,0.15357023
the ambulance we finally have the truth and the big twist of the movie revealed,0.060680162
turns out that when Addie went into the Hall of Mirrors and saw that evil,0.31089434
twin the twin choked out Addie crushing her throat the evil twin dragged Daddy into,0.69542736
the tunnel and handcuffed her down there and escaped the underground to become the new,0.15297136
Addie so we basically had a major switcheroo happen where red has been the real,0.07017567
Adelaide all along and the Addie that we've come to know has been the tethered,0.070758395
clone living in the above world so now we know the real reason why as,0.1525112
a little girl that tethered Addie wasn't able to talk because none of the tethered,0.3321597
were able to talk however this tethered version of Addie was able to learn how,0.115060106
to talk only after being exposed to all the creative activities like drawing and dancing,0.04345915
in order to express herself we also know that the reason why red was talking,0.08095256
so strangely was because of the strangulation during the encounter with the tethered Addie as,0.07872917
the family dries off into the country Jason takes a long look at his mother,0.16628106
and she looks back at him with a faint smile and he puts his mask,0.31451795
right back on we conclude the movie with the camera expanding out showing the large,0.096058
number of doppelgangers who have now replicated the Hands Across America emblem and have joined,0.15057468
hands across a large stretch of land well that was us and yeah that was,0.03702118
a lot that just happened right especially with the twist but there's one thing that,0.04936108
I think is pretty important with this movie and that is to understand the themes,0.0843532
that are going on and to understand the themes that are at work here I,0.065864325
do think that you're gonna be able to look at this movie in a whole,0.102404356
different way and just make a little bit more sense of it so to get,0.110078804
an idea of those themes let's just start off with Jordan peels own words this,0.10011799
movie is about this country we're in a time where we fear the other whether,0.13877365
it's the mysterious invader that we think is going to come and kill us and,0.79788244
take our jobs or the faction we don't live near who voted a different way,0.11116701
than us we're all about pointing the finger and I wanted to suggest that maybe,0.08148159
the monster we really need to look at has our face maybe the evil it's,0.43435782
us I think one of the most important things to do when you're going in,0.06860326
to watch the movie us is to kind of get a sense of like what,0.10661159
the themes are doing so one of the major themes that Jordan Peele is talking,0.052211434
about is the fear of the other and that's a very interesting fear that a,0.08182508
lot of us can have and it can range from a number of different things,0.042047057
whether it's miss 'ti politics immigration whatever people sometimes can fear what is other than,0.091615394
themselves and another working theme that is at play here is the concept of privilege,0.048294485
now one thing I do want to make clear is the idea that privilege is,0.061575852
not always a monetary or a financial type of thing I mean that can play,0.040915366
a part of it but privilege is always in the sense of being in relation,0.06490023
to another when you understand those themes and the intention that Pele was going for,0.030899348
you can see how they played out in the movie so let's look at some,0.1055673
examples of how privilege and the fear of the other are played out in the,0.0715601
film so in the movie the relation of privilege is between the people above ground,0.124620415
and the tethered people below red made that clear when she listed off those things,0.14891145
that she suffered from like having to eat raw rabbits not being able to choose,0.2402249
the person she loves to even having to deliver her own child red essentially demonstrates,0.115084864
that Adi enjoyed a lot of things in life in a much more comfortable and,0.07388018
privileged way the interesting thing about that scene was that we got our most obvious,0.08750224
social commentary during the scene where Abe asked who are you people and red answered,0.096725054
we're Americans I believe that Pele is using this dynamic to straight how some Americans,0.10267816
can live a privileged life and completely ignore or be ignorant to our fellow Americans,0.7196607
who are also suffering right under our noses what I like about this duality and,0.24119236
the themes is that it can be applicable to a number of different social issues,0.055387475
the quote unquote other and the fear of the other can be applicable to race,0.17679502
class wealth or even immigration we have American citizens that are literally afraid of other,0.19020034
American immigrants coming into this country trying to replace us you have people in this,0.3208041
country who have some of the best health care while other Americans can't afford it,0.09847836
or dying from the lack of it remember that scene were aid to Gabe's glasses,0.10217795
Gabe has had the privilege of having health care you know to go get glasses,0.097808436
and to be able to see clearly while Abe has never even experienced that he's,0.14769956
probably gone a lot of his tethered life walking around with blurry vision you also,0.31089434
have other instances of privilege when it comes to racial tensions when one ethnicity gets,0.14954981
disproportionately targeted and the other turns a blind eye all these situations if not more,0.15061985
are being echoed through the theme of other nests and the fear of it but,0.0653827
let's talk about that twist ending because I'll be honest I actually thought that the,0.06323244
twist ending was kind of unnecessary at first until I started to understand the themes,0.13682449
and apply them to what the movie was trying to convey I believe by having,0.10254605
addy and red switched places it proves something interesting for both the story and the,0.050647218
social commentary peel was getting at for the sake of the story read and formed,0.04159109
us that she believed that the humans who created the tethered could not replicate a,0.11578818
soul for them so instead they had to share one soul with two bodies well,0.08739755
it would appear that Addie's life in the above world proved that the tethered could,0.082283035
possibly live fully functional lives if they were given the actual opportunity access and the,0.050533053
resources we were led to believe that because the tether couldn't talk that they were,0.090026945
indeed soulless well I think Addie disproved that notion seeing as though she is a,0.24142039
tethered clone I think the same applies with the social message that Peale was trying,0.090800114
to come if we look at this from a class perspective let's pretend that Adi,0.11676656
was originally poor but then let's say she traded places with like a rich twin,0.13046047
from above well a deal earned how to dance find love have a family and,0.049534865
friends and lead a very productive life so I think what Pele is trying to,0.061654694
show with the twist in this movie is that if the people that we think,0.08916641
are others were given the same opportunities and privileges as the people above maybe those,0.08116905
others could also gain a soul of their own now it doesn't end there if,0.07075507
we stay focused on the twist ending let's also look at the other side of,0.05895757
that with Adi - Adi not only is one of the tethered people but she,0.17437308
sure as hell wasn't going to go back to that status either she was willing,0.3895114
not only to fight but to become a monster herself in order to protect the,0.42931357
privilege that she had already taken that goes back to peels commentary about how we,0.10067488
can become the very monsters we think we're fearing that monster could very well have,0.34999582
our same face or we could become the monsters - okay so now let me,0.31089434
just go over five of the most prevailing questions I've seen online and don't get,0.0808194
me wrong there are a lot of other questions that I can go over but,0.07354673
this video would be going on forever so I'm just gonna go over my top,0.09895717
five questions that I've seen out there and I'll give you my take on them,0.08861726
so let's get to it so let's get started with what was the deal with,0.06339011
the Bible verse Jeremiah 11:11 well the Bible verse goes as follows therefore thus saith,0.12521166
the Lord behold I will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able,0.5914697
to escape and though they shall cry on to me I will not hearken on,0.100257084
to them I believe that in the movie when read talks about miracles and signs,0.08056765
from God she essentially became kind of like a nat turner type of figure from,0.10061913
birth of a nation and what I mean by that is she essentially became like,0.1262494
a spiritual leader who wanted to lead a revolution that she believed was assigned to,0.11561157
her by God so in the case of Jeremiah 11:11 I believe that read just,0.100426994
saw herself as kind of like a vehicle of God's wrath upon the people that,0.31089434
she blamed for all of her suffer another interesting question is who exactly is behind,0.26612547
all of this well the movie does not explicitly say who did all of it,0.10797504
but that's more than likely an intentional move by Jordan Peele he stated in a,0.0711962
number of interviews that he wanted to keep things ambiguous so audiences can basically just,0.06974653
make up their own minds however the leading thought out there is that the perpetrator,0.14031526
in this film is actually the government or maybe some secret society or whatever read,0.09082942
says that humans were the ones that created the tethered and abandoned them for generations,0.11219988
we also got that line from zoara's saying that the government is controlling people with,0.09532454
fluoride in the water I believe that this is another bit of social commentary from,0.051124435
Pele I think what we can draw from this is that the real enemy in,0.12381594
the movie are the humans or the government that abandoned the tethered people it's almost,0.11897423
like if a government left their people with no clean water or something now as,0.19027644
a result of ditching the tethered they were left with no direction or purpose and,0.10371662
according to read they went crazy because of that the messed up thing here is,0.34791923
that the tethered people decided to focus their attention on their counterparts or fellow Americans,0.09563879
rather than trying to focus their attention on the humans that created them and left,0.13984826
them there to suffer so it could be that Pele is saying that we mean,0.17280553
to start shifting our attention to those people that are in power rather than fighting,0.09765754
one another because at the end of the day we're all connected ok another interesting,0.062436145
question was what's the deal with the rabbits now this is just my own theory,0.06385759
but I do think that the rabbits just might have started out as test subjects,0.08412323
for the cloning process that was going on down there of course since the tethered,0.066372074
were left to fend for themselves I think they released the rabbits allowing them to,0.07015264
reproduce and thus becoming a steady food source for the tethered people to eat there's,0.091907464
also the possibility that the rabbits were symbolic of the white rabbit from Alice in,0.0013487752
Wonderland you know seeing as though Addie kept traveling further and further down the tunnels,0.15040626
with a bunch of rabbits all along the way by the way a fun Easter,0.28519398
egg was that the daughters aura was wearing a rabbit on her shirt and when,0.21107544
she wore the shirt that said though that actually is Vietnamese the word rabbit and,0.15334003
another obvious question is what was the deal with the Hands Across America stuff well,0.114710815
don't feel bad like unless you grew up in the 80s you probably just never,0.110744774
heard of the Hands Across America but it was a big deal in the mid,0.09089871
80s it was a huge charitable event that involved a lot of celebrities and musicians,0.059454575
and big businesses that had a goal of trying to fight world hunger and homelessness,0.11802116
only problem is that it was a logistical nightmare I wouldn't say it's exactly the,0.059717145
same thing but I guess some people could say that it was kind of like,0.042368237
the fire festival of the 80s in one of the first scenes of the movie,0.07004535
we see the commercial for Hands Across America which a young red is actually watching,0.08164378
at a very young age before she gets captured and tossed into the tethered underground,0.14196554
so because this was like the last thing that red had really seen as a,0.081474744
child it's kind of understandable that this would make a big impression on her that,0.27212211
impression lasted even longer as red was left with the Hands Across America t-shirt and,0.11311431
she obsessed over it and Adi for years and years recalled that red said that,0.1405985
killing Adi wasn't enough and that sending a message to the world was also part,0.69542736
of the plan so red was only left with all that she knew and the,0.07951419
biggest most impactful plan that she can think of was the Hands Across America campaign,0.10713784
and of course seeing as though that the tethered people saw red as being very,0.15279183
special and unique and in a sense she's also kind of like their spiritual leader,0.15386848
they followed Reds plan to mimic the Hands Across America campaign in order to basically,0.1530261
give out a big statement to the world that would appear to be kind of,0.11754818
like a revolutionary statement okay so what's the deal with Jason so there's a lot,0.17752017
of questions that revolve around Jason's character some people are throwing out some wild theories,0.08207648
about him being switched with Pluto and whether he was a tethered person all this,0.23457414
time and all this other stuff and so on and so forth well let me,0.059929784
try and clarify this with my own opinion and some facts from the movie first,0.061978173
off given the big reveal with a DS character being a tethered person all this,0.1518526
time I think we have to understand the implications of what that means for her,0.09202043
family in the living room red said that she gave birth to Pluto and that,0.17117046
he had a love for fire so right off the bat we can eliminate the,0.2918703
notion that Pluto and Jason had been switched because red had clearly raised Pluto up,0.121966064
until this time that also means that Jason is a tease biological son too and,0.17387411
since the twist revealed that Addie is a tethered clone that means that Jason and,0.07595416
his sister Zora are in a sense biracial Jason is a byproduct of a tethered,0.2723293
clone mating with a normal person so this would actually explain why Jason seemed so,0.42821875
weird it would also account for why Addie felt the need to try and teach,0.104663484
Jason how to snap on beat during the I got five on it's song as,0.16551399
some people have noticed even Addie was offbeat herself when she was trying to teach,0.14936946
him how to get in rhythm but just think why would anyone teach their kid,0.1413835
rhythm unless they were born without a soul so now we can kind of go,0.19646427
back and look at that final shot of Jason looking at his mother and deciding,0.23327889
to put on his mask I thought it was a really interesting moment because throughout,0.09554493
the movie jason has always been wearing a mask and it's not like it's Halloween,0.115787655
or anything but even more specifically Jason's mask was that of a monster so when,0.31089434
jason has witnessed his mother doing some really gruesome things I think that Jason choosing,0.36889288
to put on a monster mask symbolizes how we function in society in a way,0.40323237
we may literally see the horrors and the ugly truth in society other people or,0.4778996
even in our friends and family but rather than confronting those issues we tend to,0.077337354
put on our monster mask and continue about our day this might signify the notion,0.4074704
that Jason knows just how much of a monster his mother can be but he's,0.7364161
willing to put a figurative and literal mask on to continue living life just as,0.2585552
usual and ignore that ugly truth well those are my thoughts on the movie us,0.5269823
along with my breakdown and analysis and I know that there are a ton of,0.090420544
questions and Easter eggs and way more theories that could be made about this movie,0.13619138
and there's absolutely no way I even have the amount of time to cover every,0.088506825
single one of them but I would love for you all to mention your thoughts,0.13528506
