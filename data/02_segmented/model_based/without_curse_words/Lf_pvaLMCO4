How everyone today? I'll be reviewing It happens one night
"So it happened one night, was directed by Frank Capra and stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, and Assume come out in 1934, which was only a few years into the sound era, but before the Hays Code era, which enforced lots of censorship on films"
"At the start of this film we see Call that Colver, She plays a rich woman and she's on this boat with her father and her father"
She's trying to convince her not to marry this man
"Say cold, call that Kolbert"
"She wants to marry this man, but her father basically doesn't agree with it"
"Really so cool at Hobart, She escapes in the boat and she basically tries to escape and go across to New York City to find the man that she wants to marry"
So then we see Clark April's character come in
"So Clark Gable, he plays a man who works for a newspaper"
"He's always looking for a good story, and he comes across, Call that colder, and he, then she realizes that she is on the blunt from her family in order to marry this man that she wants to marry"
"So Clark, they have always thinking"
"Okay, I've got a great story here"
"Maybe I can make something of this, so this film really does so well Is blend comedy with a romance"
"Well, a rom-com Really obviously, and this is one of the best well, as opposed to one of the best classic Long comes from the era"
"Now I myself, I'm not necessarily a big fan of romantic comedies especially for this sort of era, but I think this is very good"
this film
It's It's actually surprisingly funny
I found myself chuckling a few times
I thought it was very funny and lots of bits
I really like Clark Gable in this film
"I've only seen Clark Gable in one other film, Gone With the Winds and he was very good in that, but he's a lot funny"
in this film
He has lots of witty lines
A lot
the things he says seem very well timed and it's just very funny and I really like a chemistry between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert
Every scene they're in together is going to see quite a lot
The film
"They work off each other really well, and the two characters"
they're always trying to one-up each other in each scene
"So as I seen a star where Clark Gable was trying to get a seat on my bus, But all that Colbert takes a seat first and then the bus driver says it's first-come first-serve And then later on there's a scene where Claudette Colbert misses her bus"
"So then quite cables just sat there smiling and it's all these sorts of things which work really well in making us like these characters, and both these actors in these roles, they're both such likeable characters"
It's impossible not to like these two
and it just makes for a very light-hearted film
Though Are a few darker little bits here and there
"It's not happy all the way through, but obviously the overall tone of the film is very happy and very enjoyable"
Now this film did very well at the Oscars
"Actually won the five big main Oscars which are Best Picture, Best Director for Frank Capra Best Actor for Clark Gable, Best Actress for Pulled At Holder and Best Adapted Screenplay"
"Now there's only two other films or one those all those five big main Oscars, and that is one"
"Flow, The Cuckoo's Nest in 1975 and then the silence around in 1991"
"One of my favorite scenes in this film is when Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert on a coach together and then everybody on the coach is singing along to the spans that is playing at the back of the bus and is playing this song called The Man with the Flying Trapeze, and everyone on the bus kind of joins in with the singing and they all sing different parts of the verses And it's just a very enjoyable scenes"
It's a very like all scenery set on the film
"Really Well, Another scene which is really clever, actually is a scene where Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert trying to hitchhike, so staying at the side of the road, and Clark Gable, he thinks is really clever"
"He think he knows all the different ways to get the cars attention by waving her arms in a certain way, or stick a knightly thumb in a certain way, and all it's get the driver's attention and he tries lots of different variants"
It tries about six or seven times
"he throws every time, So then call that Kolbert"
"She comes up and she just sticks her leg out and it says, Go up above the knee, And then the first driver stop straightaway That's a very funny scene"
Another scene which is really famous Film
"Actually, when they're on the bus, there's his character called Oscar Shapley, who is sitting next to Cool Debt Colbert's character, and he's a character who talked to really quickly and he's obviously very attracted to pull that whole box"
so he gets
"So he's saying all these things that are trying, pressor, And he's just a very funny, quite annoying character And there's a few very funny scenes, which is in which stand out quite a lot"
"And his character was actually part of the inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny, And it was actually a scene where Clark Gable is leaning on a fence and is eating the carrot"
And that also was actually part of the inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny as well
"In terms of what I don't like about this film, I suppose the plot is a little bit predictable"
Especially the the way the film ends is quite standard
"Really, You almost expect it to end a certain way"
Well I did anyway
"From my point of view, I found ending a little bit predictable"
"Not that's a bad thing, but there are some other romance films, particularly ones like Casablanca, which end in a way that you don't expect"
Roses
Film ends in a way which I was expecting
I could almost see it going in this direction and I wasn't surprised by how the film ended at all
I was not to say that I didn't like how the film ended
"I did like the way it ended, but it just it wasn't that surprising, perhaps a little bit predictable"
"but again, that's not necessarily a bad thing"
"So all in all, I have to say that it happened one night is a fantastic romantic comedy"
I think most people should be able to enjoy this
It's It's a fairly easy film to watch these two characters
"quite a Bond call that, although they're both such likeable characters in this film, the on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic and overall it's a very enjoyable film to watch, so I'm going to give and one night a rating of 8 out of 10"
"I don't think it's a fantastic bill, but I do think it's a very good classic romantic comedy and probably one of the best romantic comedies from this sort of error that I've seen"
So there we go
So that is it happened one night
So what do you guys think? Have you seen it happen tonight? Would you like to see it? Let me know down in the comments what your thoughts are anyway
Thank you all very much watching
I'll see you in the next video
