the irishman martin scorsese the epic netflix saga that they slid out to theaters this,0.15142532
three it's three and a half hours long guys but it reunited him with Robert,0.071284235
DeNiro and Joe Pesci once again we all know they made magic with casino and,0.101672076
Goodfellas there's a straight magic Goodfellas is easily hands-down one of my favorite movies of,0.11472351
all time so it's my by default my favorite Martin Scorsese movie Robert DeNiro plays,0.054643128
Frank Sheeran who's a you know real life character who you know worked with mob,0.40327093
you know we're very closely with Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci who they brought,0.09915433
out of retirement for this joint Joe Pesci's been shelling he's been I'm out the,0.13874562
game this one I think I'm out they pull me back they blue leave a,0.18768407
key and they say like Robert and Martin had to really convince him to come,0.043784924
do this movie that must be nice man you when you're good you just walk,0.15210518
away from the game for years be like I don't know like you're settled you,0.15299371
said you don't need the money whatever and then you can demand whatever you want,0.10792789
if legs look give me seven million dollars to do this movie and Netflix like,0.29478517
we had money this movie costs a hundred and fifty million dollars to me a,0.05325677
hundred and fifty million dollars for drama this is ridiculous man man yeah I bet,0.69542736
you Joe was like give me 75 million dollars and there's our joke come on,0.22614148
please Netflix man we bottomed the Soviet baby man three and a half hours 150,0.3661794
million this is better be good excuse my language but man you know and the,0.09033093
critics loved it they was like yo this is a masterpiece oh and how can,0.13691677
I forget who else is in this Al Pacino so you got Alba Chino Robert,0.08988748
De Niro Joe Pesci in one move I'm saying the last time Al Pacino or,0.074120104
Robert De Niro all together real righteous kill we just go forget about that that,0.47889775
movie was hot guy hot righteous kill was a hot garbage it was like somebody,0.794439
took some garbage boiled it added some seasoning you know there's an old here the,0.53490317
garbage put in the bowl and served it hot but he that's the Pacino De,0.6739814
Niro combo that we all love so it's good to see them back again it's,0.11477592
really the story about a guy Frank Sheeran he's Irish and he starts doing like,0.114492245
you know jobs with mob-connected men he starts you know rising up the ranks doing,0.15020409
doing odd jobs or isn't it then kind of doing hits a little bit you,0.35273796
know I want to put a business out there but you know doing some real,0.10210488
dirt and doing what he ever had to do for them essentially it's like I'll,0.24924195
do it I'll do it I'll do it you know I mean and so you,0.16558968
still get that Scorsese you know people getting capped we've come to expect like you,0.30000016
know people getting shot up you know this in here well at three and a,0.35723752
half hours it's gonna be the slow pace it's a slow pace it's a slow,0.14887138
pace like because it goes through all these years ago it goes and so they're,0.059000235
using this special effects thing the D age you know the actors and make them,0.1425151
look older make them look younger so they're doing all of this and some people,0.1206509
thought it was distracting I really didn't bother me too much I was just like,0.08779109
okay I couldn't they never really made Robert De Niro look young no like he,0.15302409
was supposed to be mad long ago he was still looking old so they were,0.1888552
trying to make him look young and they kind of fumbled now I'm like he's,0.15829486
still look old but just smooth the skin that's all it was he was an,0.15965773
old man with smooth skin it's like yo this is me in my 20s and,0.2580883
he looked like Robert De Niro in his seventies with smooth skin that's the only,0.1544275
the only thing I really saw so basically is that and you know you you,0.08961567
get to see Robert De Niro's family how his daughter looked at him and I,0.11826632
thought that was a really interesting dynamic within the story is just how how his,0.03477619
kids viewed what he was doing because a lot of times you don't really see,0.14484534
that you see you know these guys have families of course but you don't really,0.077164754
see like a kid that really doesn't like what you're doing and knows it because,0.18936333
kids man we out here man we we we see what our parents do and,0.16332947
it affects us for them to really play on that I really enjoyed that aspect,0.11553533
of it because it was like yo I don't I don't like what you're doing,0.17900258
you know cuz a lot of times kids don't feel like they have any place,0.1937861
to say that to their parents or they just hold it in or they just,0.08782457
become what their parents were but it's good just to see like I'm not feeling,0.08542851
this from a little girl throughout you know understands just to see that transition Al,0.101343334
Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa he killed it in this movie he nailed it you know,0.5888176
a lot of times Al Pacino can go over the top he's been going over,0.07358816
the top you know in his later roles all right man just this dial it,0.1456085
back a little bit no I will not you know but in this it worked,0.17024666
because that's the type of person Jimmy Hoffa was but if you look up Jimmy,0.08053184
Hoffa like he was fiery like he you know he got the union's really going,0.1304672
like he was one of the main guys in the country like it was the,0.082101814
president then like Jimmy Hoffa and so what he was doing was really big really,0.11775671
important and so I felt like you needed that type of delivery for Jimmy Hoffa,0.08811657
and I thought he nailed it I thought he was a doe very stubborn but,0.34423625
a dope character to watch you were all in and you kind of respect how,0.40322152
he wasn't scared of the mob I like to see that even though most of,0.11063737
the people in movies they just bow down to the mob you know it was,0.16640668
it was interesting to see a character that even though they can hurt you he,0.15069062
still never really backed down and I thought that was pretty dope Joe Pesci's character,0.21700948
you know usually Joe Pesci in the Martin Scorsese movie he's the hotheads fireball short,0.36574584
Wolverine I kill you right now I kill you what's funny in my job to,0.94803387
you was funny you know just a hot Headz volcano now he's completely subdued quiet,0.46602887
you know still we'll get you cue but it's very like understated quiet but when,0.09704834
he's around you feel the presence of like you know danger like serious business I,0.29877654
can hurt you I can get things done and I love how Joe Pesci played,0.18683095
it very understated very chill very quiet and it's like yo it works and so,0.12228899
you know a lot of people are clowning it this long and slow but I,0.18611237
think they really just focusing on the wrong things like you know even though the,0.11809039
the age of fire didn't really work all right it didn't work but I could,0.07891752
still focus on the story and the performances and I feel like it was a,0.047020443
