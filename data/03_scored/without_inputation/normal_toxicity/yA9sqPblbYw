hello everyone and welcome to my review i'm so excited to talk about this movie this is the first pixar animated studio movie in two years,0.120071724
i can't believe it's been two years since we've had a movie from this studio,0.06450969
and they've entertained us for 20.,0.053789403
but before i talk about their brand new movie i just want to quickly talk about the short film that i believe premiered,0.10552992
this is the first time i think this short has ever been shown i could be totally wrong,0.16801946
i don't see all the shorts from pixar,0.1713287
but quickly i just want to talk about a short pixar short called lava as we get to hear this wonderful hawaiian song,0.07167531
and we get to meet this volcano that is just full of love and full of singing,0.0832709
and this short had so much amazing beautiful textured animation,0.1851315
i think this is definitely one of the best pixar shorts i have ever seen i felt so much emotion,0.08041309
and i almost want to see a whole movie about what i just witnessed it was just so magical and wonderful and beautiful,0.0488586
and i really loved the song what an amazing return for this great studio at least for this short,0.14169571
i'll get into my feelings of inside out in just a few seconds,0.32673734
but i just really want to focus just a little bit of energy right now and i'm almost done about that beautiful short talk about in the comment box below what did you feel about lava did it touch your heart it touched my soul and i actually clapped afterwards i was one of me and my friend we clapped we were the only ones in the studio clapping,0.15426023
and i know this the animators weren't there nobody was there to listen but i was just like wow,0.084382854
thank you,0.039406788
that was a amazing,0.046577156
short all right everyone let's talk about inside out,0.15089741
this is the brand new animated film two years of course we're getting more and more after this i'm a huge fan of pixar,0.08727388
i love their movies i think they're classics masterpiece great and good yes you probably know what i'm talking about cars too i like it,0.07651715
i don't think i'll ever watch it again,0.14508656
i'm not looking forward to cars 3,0.15882415
but for me pixar's really never ever disappointed me,0.1437153
they're one of the best animated studios,0.089283206
if not the best animated studios working today,0.06267618
and maybe work forever i hope they i just hope they live on and we get to see so many amazing stories and if they make mistakes so what they know they're going to rise up above any mistake they made and hopefully make something that is great,0.085868895
and that's what i was hoping for with this brand new film inside out of course,0.09949387
we get to meet a young little girl named riley,0.25180662
we get to meet her parents,0.113879375
but what's also important about this film is that we get to peek into her mind we get to meet anger and sadness and disgust and fear and joy,0.18042275
and of course all these little weird characters and emotions are played by people we all recognize there's no need to mention them of course,0.07558893
you know about them already you know all the voices,0.079374455
what is hopefully going to be important is that we're going to care about the characters we're going to care about the journey that happens between of course the humans and what is going on in their mind,0.078828834
and that's the adventure,0.07117688
we get we get to peek into the mind of what's actually going on in our head of course,0.15434663
we get to see this through,0.05283903
this little innocent little girl that's going to her first day of school because she's just moved,0.43473393
well she's experienced school before but of course it's a new area because she lived in minnesota with their family,0.13524814
and for some reason they've moved to san francisco,0.11112378
though i don't know if that ever is made clear but that's okay uh that's okay not not no no issues right there,0.092047416
but the movie kind of flashes back and forth as we get to see her and her struggles something weird is happening,0.08920329
thanks to the emotions in her mind and the journey that they go on to to hopefully bring her back home and bring her back to who riley is the person that she is uh emotions and feelings and joy and happiness,0.12613752
and fear and anger and all those things that we all deal with on a daily basis,0.12578087
but we never really i don't know if we ever had a fun,0.08583842
and entertaining insightful look into our own minds like this movie presented i had emotions,0.13195558
i don't know if i ever felt disgust,0.46706566
i never really felt disgust while i was watching this movie i never really felt anger while watching this feeling but i did feel sadness joy and fear i'll get into fear first because fear maybe can be some of my nitpicking complaints that i'm not going to go in grand detail because i don't want to spoil anything,0.15473203
but i do want to mention my favorite character in this film is bing,0.070590414
bong see the film you'll see bing bong is my favorite character,0.1085353
i love all the other people but bing bong,0.26998746
i can't wait to own,0.12905107
i know they're gonna that thing's,0.058592565
gonna sell like hot cakes,0.11754297
people are gonna have bing bongs,0.2841042
i'm gonna have a bing bong,0.23419447
i haven't had a i haven't had a stuffed animal forever,0.21415089
i want to get a bing bong,0.31089434
so see the film then you'll know where am i at okay um,0.06717515
so yes i had a little bit of fear watching this movie at times because we're enjoying uh this whole journey of going back and forth,0.07800068
but sometimes i was like where is this film going i mean,0.05175612
there's so much animation in this movie that i'm trying to control myself because i'm like wait what's going on over here,0.13653629
what's happening over here,0.07552457
am,0.030887341
i having any emotional connection to all the crazy insane things that are popping up and peering into the minds of what's going on in this little girl's mind and how she's dealing with certain things,0.53490317
and how this world might be coming down to an end because she's feeling so much anxiety and it's just i just yeah,0.1779279
so i i have to admit there were times in the film where i felt a little fear like i didn't know what to make of what was going on but i really cared about the characters specifically of course sadness,0.06159855
and joy because we go on this journey with those two characters and everybody gets a chance to shine in this movie of course the voice work is amazing,0.04626111
i liked the human characters i liked the emotional characters,0.085830614
i liked all the little surprises that we got to go as we get really into the mind of this character,0.094488434
i mean of riley and we get to peek into what she's passionate about what she cares about and that's where the joy and the sadness kicked in pixar is so good,0.28682542
and this is you know of course pete doctor the director of up and monsters inc of course probably some of the best animated films ever made just especially up up is one of my favorites of all time and every time i hear that oscar winning score i cry i cry i feel sadness and joy uh i just i loved the insight that this movie explored yes it's a family movie it's animation and stuff like that and kids will enjoy all the colors,0.13986036
and and the characters,0.057973344
and the bumbling things bing bong,0.27994317
yeah they're gonna i think they're just gonna eat up bing bong bing bong's like hero okay um but i think the adults will appreciate it too maybe on a nostalgic level of just like remembering the memories you had when you were a kid,0.14698875
yes,0.036876976
this movie focuses on a little girl but i think anybody who has a heart and a soul can connect to this story,0.19147605
that's what makes this movie so magical and i do like that it appears into the minds for a little bit of the parents and see what's going on and how it's kind of shaped their lives and how you know they're kind of set in their ways,0.17813064
but when you're a kid it's kind of weird when you're a kid,0.27899152
i guess according to this film joy and sadness are like feminine qualities also discussed according to this film at least,0.18758775
and then anger and fear are kind of more male qualities at least according to this film,0.31089434
so that'd be cool true,0.041335773
because i think i grabbed some of my joy and sadness from my mom and a little bit of my anger from my dad,0.25695994
so yeah that's yeah interesting,0.0884018
you know just in sight,0.07589027
that's what i appreciate this movie,0.07934784
so much why i appreciate this movement so much is the insight into the into the mind the human and how it works and how memories work uh i think after watching this film as a society we're definitely going to every time we have a thought or something go on our mind whether it's something that's important to happen to us or just a stupid song or commercial that's stuck in our head,0.6364068
we are going to think about inside out,0.091792986
and that's what's so great about this film what's so magical about uh the message of this movie,0.08574598
and this is a film of course and probably a lot of people repeating a lot of people,0.078426264
what people said this is a film that is definitely going to put pixar on the map again we're never going to forget pixar yes they've made some mistakes,0.08216533
but this is definitely a prime example of why pixar animation studios is the best they can bring out so much emotion and give us so many memorable characters,0.07631083
and then on top of that some of the best animation you're ever going to see i could talk about this movie for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours this is uh i predict right,0.15341693
now i i do predict that this film will win the oscar for best animated film,0.10601473
i'm gonna leave it at that because i think it's definitely worthy of it all right,0.15040255
