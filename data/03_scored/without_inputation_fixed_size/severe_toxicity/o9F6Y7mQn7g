completely Internet gone not streaming at all so don't get any spoilers of anything keeping,0.052608043

home at like 4:00 little earlier than four I'm I had nothing but Raisinets and,0.054926876
coffee for the past like 12 hours I'm my face is red I'm breaking out,0.05341092
I'm sweaty everything is going crazy I'm trying to catch up on work that I've,0.0906346
messed up on and and everything is insane but we're here to discuss a review,0.07311965
for Avengers endgame I don't do movie reviews at all so if you're new here,0.031064076
hi I'm Berkey I don't do these but they're fun sometimes so I occasionally do,0.068374224
them but we are just going here to discuss Avengers endgame because of course we,0.014650005
are because of course I gotta get that YouTube money but of course I want,0.056877192
to talk about it I did a review for infinity war back in the day,0.063541
as well and so I thought be a very interesting thing to go ahead and,0.020999847
talk about this particular movie because it's a big deal and unfortunately reviewing the movie,0.05030917
is hard as hell because the trailer showed maybe the first quarter of the film,0.16177133
and they showed you basically nothing and it has it's just not it's nothing they,0.029656548
shown you pretty much nothing and the trailers are fantastic they do a great job,0.057229076
at setting up the movie and setting up what you think you'll be getting into,0.0316521
when in reality there is so much more going on and it's pretty fantastic when,0.025816442
you actually do see it now what do I think in the movie it's great,0.054204486
it's phenomenal actually it is incredible it is in my opinion not as good as,0.060320847
infinity war however it has a lot of parts that are better than infinity war,0.16779724
and that's hard to entirely describe without going into spoilers which I will not be,0.048496544
going into today and it's difficult to really provide a good reason or discussion of,0.016871054
why I think part of it is really really good and better than infinity war,0.16102898
but as a movie I would probably consider it just slightly lower like if you,0.05660247
had a top-five list of Marvel movies if any war beer they're an endgame would,0.109289005
be right below it but overall it is a pretty phenomenal movie it is long,0.049501635
movie three hours long and there are no good bathroom breaks so just don't drink,0.02467898
water at all ever in that entire day dehydrate yourself I don't know just there,0.046149775
are no good time solely by the bathroom the three hours fly by I understand,0.026718432
three hours this is like interstellar length of a movie so it flies by but,0.060612198
it is still very long and it split up into three acts like most things,0.051909603
are and the first act that I could name each acts in their own ways,0.07112942
the first act is depression and sadness the second act is comedy and fanservice and,0.04608725
the third act is spectacle the first act is actually probably my favourite act it,0.040447157
deals a lot with what happens when Thanos does his snap what happens when half,0.065902404
the population is eradicated and how these Avengers and people are trying to survive afterwards,0.16758238
because it hurts it hurts pretty bad and these are all actors that are incredibly,0.12079402
good we kind of forget that the people who play these roles are very talented,0.013805222
actors and actresses Robert Downey jr. Jeremy Renner Paul Rudd skal Johansen etc these are,0.05973416
good actors you know I mean they may not always be in good films but,0.056918435
they can act em it's nice to have them finally acting finally showing pain and,0.1836266
and sadness and depression and it is extremely good in particular there is a lot,0.041301254
of Hawkeye and ant-man in this movie and they are actually pretty damn good Scott,0.23155601
Lang and Liz it was a Clint Barton last name Paul Rudd and Jeremy Renner,0.07824023
they do a great job in their respective roles they have a lot of screen,0.04137509
time and especially Hawkeye has a very good amount of time and he really has,0.02676566
a nicely developed character I thoroughly enjoyed him this movie focuses a lot more around,0.027416874
the six main Avengers so that's Iron Man's Hulk Thor Captain America Black Widow Hawkeye,0.02080495
and it does actually do a little bit of ant-man as well like I just,0.06381373
mentioned but those here main main ingredient players personally captain America is my favorite Avenger,0.015927156
and he has been ever since Civil War actually no no no Winter Soldier because,0.02986874
he seems like he went through a lot of arcs the first Captain America movie,0.033355635
it was pretty good but it wasn't anything overly fantastic and his character wasn't overly,0.07894932
interesting it was just I am small and weak and now I am big and,0.06385829
strong but his morals and his own personal personality didn't really change civil erb when,0.040086627
a soldier really kind of put the screws to that Civil War put the screws,0.10662828
to it even more and now I think he's a really well fleshed out character,0.0671177
and he got a decent amount of screen time he's actually very important in this,0.031053433
movie primarily Robert Downey jr. and Chris Evans so Iron Man Captain America do a,0.018375698
pretty phenomenal job in their in their retrospective areas em days do the show sometimes,0.051845077
and it becomes pretty damn fantastic going over to the second act it's a lot,0.15678245
more fanservice see is it too fanservice see maybe I don't know on a first,0.034686666
viewing I loved the hell out of it it was great both in terms of,0.12906891
emotional punches comedic punches and just fanservice in general however I do wonder if I'll,0.11466968
get tired of it on subsequent viewings I'll have to see it again in order,0.029764308
to legitimately think about that but the second act is actually my personal opinion the,0.023429098
weakest of the three acts not because it's bad but because of some pacing issues,0.053700276
it's a little bit - alright we're doing this and then we're doing this and,0.045348894
then these people are doing this these people are doing this then but but they're,0.02607919
doing this also and we gotta be careful cuz these guys are doing this and,0.019153964
we gotta cut back because we gotta save on time and it's still a three-hour,0.03303435
long movie you could probably make the entire film or you could make an entire,0.03642346
film we're on the second act and happen to be a full-fledged movie I think,0.04041057
the pacing was a little bit difficult there but it was still pretty sob and,0.063185126
the third act is just it's it's just insane it's it's ridiculous it is an,0.23810045
absolute spectacle it is fantastic crazy looking and I can't really describe it in any,0.0629603
way because anything that I could describe it with will be a spoiler and is,0.02598806
just too too crazy I can't say anything about it the third act is immense,0.1080052
one of the most impressive third acts of any movie I've ever seen it is,0.023172338
the culmination of 10 years of filmmaking 10 years of Marvel BAM right into the,0.046149775
last 45 minutes and it is pretty incredible it is it's undescribable I can't really,0.02425193
talk about it without you actually going out and seeing it or spoiling it so,0.05926121
I am just saying it's great it does have some downsides at least part I,0.03351528
mean throughout the full movie not the 3rd act in primarily but overall the movie,0.044259988
is phenomenal it is a very good final movie it is a great kind of,0.0332818
farewell to the first 10 years there's obviously gonna be more Marvel movies but it,0.037332766
is a solid end piece and game haha jokes jokes I'm just so funny but,0.029304
sorry sorry yeah it's a great 10 it's a great 10-year send-off and overall some,0.058368534
pacing issues I have also you can nitpick the out of this movie it's just,0.042928956
a warning if you're like kind of people that really care about specifics and and,0.119484946
certain continuity and wait if they did this in this movie how are they doing,0.041327193
this in endgame and how why don't they just do this and that you can,0.047216732
you'll do that and if you're that kind of person you will do that a,0.04054494
lot there are a lot of issues like that I can name a loft out,0.023773663
of my head and if that's the kind of thing that really bugs you like,0.118342824
this does this and I hate this because this was supposed to be this in,0.092618175
that movie then okay valid criticisms valid criticisms and I completely see that but expectations,0.035031233
are important in a movie and I'll say this like I said before in games,0.035751626
I don't play Uncharted and I don't expect Uncharted to be God of War and,0.13361943
I don't play papers please and expect it to be Metal Gear Rising you need,0.016858414
to know what you're getting into you're getting into a big spectacle comic book movie,0.09087406
yeah there are coincidences yeah there are easy things that work with the plot and,0.025813783
yeah there are plot points that are there just to do this thing of course,0.029129056
there are it's a Marvel movie this is what you're getting you can nitpick the,0.035850074
out of this movie but the movie almost kind of knows this it almost knows,0.030248562
that you can nitpick it and so it just doesn't care and at the end,0.033747427
of the day I'm kind of okay with that because knowing what the movie is,0.02620491
is more important than trying to fix all of it kind of like gari is,0.017373266
the galaxy right it's dumb and it's fun and it's silly and it knows it,0.30323863
is and because of that is a better movie because of at the end so,0.020456392
that's my review phenomenal not the best Marvel movie ever but absolutely great a fantastic,0.064399086
send-off some really great emotional beats big fan absolutely go see if you haven't been,0.11632798
spoiled yet or you haven't seen already tomorrow have any spoiler review as well if,0.04563027
