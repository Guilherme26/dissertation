hi I'm Andre I'm a black nerd with a review for you the new reviews,0.633415
Thor Ragnarok I'm gonna give it a good I'm gonna be the bad I'm gonna,0.18000726
be the nerdy so I'm not gonna spoil everything about the movie but I will,0.46828663
talk into detail about some of the plots in the movie so that could be,0.060615234
seen as spoilers I did a video earlier this week where I actually went to,0.047313895
the Thor Ragnarok premiere and I gave a little mini review at the end of,0.06906959
that video about how I felt about the movie in general so if you want,0.10483727
no spoilers I would recommend checking out that I would actually just recommend checking out,0.093020156
the video in general because Tessa Thompson may or may not be in it just,0.08136794
sayin and someone may or may not have met her just sayin I also love,0.09461819
the fact that I saw this movie incredibly early and yet I'm still one of,0.07566399
the last people to actually review it on YouTube it's even earlier that I see,0.122277886
a movie though later I review it I'm terrible at this I should just quit,0.15532582
I'm not gonna quit I can never quit you no matter what your comment say,0.14971435
what can I say about Thor Ragnarok let me point this out to you and,0.11428101
I mean this as a positive compliment let's say you took your favorite Saturday morning,0.06969536
cartoon from the 80s and 90s and you said okay Saturday morning cartoon I know,0.1107225
you're cheap and just made to sell toys but what if I gave you a,0.4031136
good director a good script and a good budget to do whatever you want and,0.06589857
make an awesome movie but still like a Saturday morning cartoon that's the Ragnarok this,0.103228815
movie is so freaking fun if I feel like Laura Ragnarok finally embraces and accepts,0.36043513
the world that it's in feel like now that we've gotten past the dark world,0.13993028
and Garn is the galaxy and dr. strange that now Marvel is like let's go,0.10562686
all out with magic and creatures and powers and all this stuff and thor ragnarok,0.17654938
just fully embraces that and it's fun i mean this is the kind of stuff,0.11592478
that i would have loved to see more of in the other two movies because,0.050773904
i feel like it was kind of holding back a little bit whereas now it's,0.08126962
like BAM just put it all out there you can definitely get a guardians of,0.101972304
the galaxy vibe from this movie like it clearly watch that movie and when mm-hmm,0.07420837
that's what Thor needs to do guys that's what the word he used to do,0.063151665
and a lot of it has to do with the direction tygo ytt is an,0.06666749
amazing director this movie handles a lot of different plots in subject matters some more,0.054939244
on a light-hearted comedic side and some on the darker dramatic side and he found,0.12292982
a way to take something like this with these different elements and still always make,0.07266132
it feel like one movie but when it is funny oh my gosh - the,0.11745434
movie is hilarious and again I want to point out the reason why I think,0.1091496
it's it's funny good is because it's funny in the natural element of the story,0.058123942
and the comedy came more from the characteristics of the characters in the movie and,0.047644712
what they were saying is their characters as opposed to like Marvel stand-up and we've,0.10492228
seen Marvel's standup you know what I'm saying this one I think they really fleshed,0.105944924
out Thor better they put a little bit more humor into him and they had,0.12620308
him really showcased a little bit more than just being I'm a god and I,0.13478602
can fight things Loki of course is up in this everyone loves Loki he's in,0.15249203
top form as always but the whole Thor I hope dynamic of course Thor ends,0.085291035
up in this tournament and he has to fight the Hulk meanwhile Hulk is in,0.10168893
this weird state where he can't change back to Bruce Banner and Thor has to,0.11512238
kind of help him out with that the dynamic of those two almost are to,0.066893734
feel like a buddy cop film we got to see a little bit more of,0.13639016
Hope in this movie I still kind of wish that some of these elements could,0.08420053
have led itself into a solo Hulk film but if this is what we got,0.082363345
to do to get the Incredible Hulk more on-screen and to see more of him,0.09323753
and establish that cared a little bit more I thought I did it in a,0.11241515
really good way and we got ourselves a good Marvel villain I really really like,0.16538331
Cate Blanchett as hella in this now warning here's where some spoilers come in so,0.22026606
hella is this evil goddess and we find out that not only is she evil,0.5335639
but she also happens to be related to Thor she's actually Thor's sister Odin's daughter,0.31089434
her and Odin used to be back in the day just crazy warriors taking over,0.61958086
other worlds just causing all kinds of damage and destruction as warriors and then of,0.31089434
course Odin was like well I got kids now so I can't do that no,0.27460012
more we're done and hella still wants to do it and oh it is all,0.17518541
like none not only are we done but since you still want to do it,0.08649348
I'm have to banish you you gotta go and I gotta say man I don't,0.46478274
really like Odin took this movie for me to really go you know what oh,0.24259484
it is kind of the big you know like he said some nice things the,0.05245901
word Loki - have a love for him because he's the father I get it,0.12562513
but he banished Thor in a moment Thor got cocky about being a warrior which,0.52257824
is the past of Asgard in itself he adopted Loki but never told Loki the,0.07411832
full story to where he always felt resentful of Thor because he was true Sun,0.11775001
and Loki was adopted son and now we got hella this daughter that was side,0.2771407
by side and battling him and then one day he just changed his mind and,0.20266825
then gonna try to tell her she's wrong for doing what they were already doing,0.21560323
before it's like when you were smoker and you're a drinker and you stop and,0.69542736
then you started point out other people would stop smoking this time dream like hey,0.15207905
you were there with me Oh didn't you got some issues man it's another one,0.254707
these complicated father relationships as Marvel Cinematic Universe if you're looking for the dramatic dark,0.1136424
stuff in Thor Ragnarok it all comes from hell she is not a jokester she,0.40325683
is not doing any one-liners her one mission is I am pissed off at Asgard,0.42010882
I am pissed off and Odin I'm pissed off and Thor and everybody in my,0.49436235
path got to die and I mean that literally like for a movie that's got,0.5154597
some wacky funny jokes in it there's some straight-up like just mean death and like,0.5505026
even with characters that you know like people that have been in the Thor storyline,0.08032193
for a couple of movies literally just walking on the screen to go hey what's,0.082085654
that remember me sick don't even show up she just disappeared she wasn't even in,0.4454577
the movie but everybody else in that crew you know that crude authorities hang out,0.08653155
with they are in this movie for like five seconds hell is like yeah you're,0.45102885
right now yep yep Callen just was a straight-up clean house of characters for the,0.05579281
Marvel Cinematic Universe and then Karl Urban's there and he's all like don't kill me,0.41700113
she's like great will you the executioner now I'm a command here to kill other,0.7322222
people he's like seriously I just got here he just elbows gotta go into hiding,0.16956866
em dogs gotta like take off his big old crown and get away from the,0.592472
the open date there the mariokart road and just be like in the for somewhere,0.06212163
like let me go wait I'm gonna stay alive because black panels coming up in,0.5383559
February honey if you can't make myself get a cameo don't kill me hella as,0.45237485
the worst aegis elbow impression by the way thank you very much but enough about,0.28036162
hella oh my gosh uh Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie good lord uh what can I,0.30357486
say I love her I love everything about her the moment she walks on screen,0.117443725
she is great she is strong she is powerful she is awesome but she is,0.06755731
also flawed because she is an alcoholic very first scene that you see her is,0.6146522
she's like what's up I'm here to fight yeah Wow okay that's an entrance her,0.24066615
character is just so amazing and so cool when there's all these cool shots of,0.08743857
her when she's walking and like explosions are happening when hotter like he's a freakin,0.78048617
Power Ranger she's just amazing man I just really liked her and then she has,0.08731054
this incredible backstory about her and this army of women warriors you get this backstory,0.34610406
or this is his flashback where heard a bunch of warriors of fighting hella and,0.28401864
their own freaking flying unicorns and horses of whatever and helis throwing stuff in the,0.69542736
air and it's all in slow motion and it's got these different effects I'm telling,0.09972507
you it feels like a Saturday morning cartoon with a budget and there's a whole,0.23688938
point of the movie where I'm like I need that movie like entirety like I,0.07300327
need more of that like can we just strip that out make a prequel film,0.18602799
or sideways movie and give me that I'm telling that shot oh man that was,0.3096029
so cool you know a lot of people always talk to rag on DC and,0.18478306
stuff but I'm gonna say man I feel like Marvin might've saw one woman I,0.17827736
was like yeah we were gonna cut that scene but I think now we're gonna,0.14881642
leave it in you you're right tiger look at this let's hold on to that,0.087694146
she's awesome she's just really I just I can't say enough about her she's just,0.15954728
a really cool character one of the strongest female Marvel hero that we've seen in,0.17999746
some time and again hopefully when she gets back on that ship again she could,0.099200845
take a trip to her condo just be like hey what's up I brought him,0.15422986
go with me to Falcon is riding shotgun war machine flew behind us Peter picked,0.31089434
up sand data from spider-man homecoming we all here go boom it's all I say,0.12236617
if you like go bloom you're gonna get some Goldblum in this gold boom is,0.13727091
at full Goldblum in this movie it's Grandmaster right cuz I keep want to call,0.1227913
him taskmaster for some reason but it's Grandmaster I also love that kind of turn,0.11185428
a little bit in Jeff go boom when I try to explain that you hear,0.124573275
me go uh a grandmaster if you know Jeff Goldblum and you know how Jeff,0.15150939
Goldblum is and that's the Jeff Goldblum you want to see thor ragnarok deliveries but,0.077790454
there's his new character Korg I really liked him and I found out later that,0.08580137
the director Tycho martyt was the voice of him he was really funny too I,0.057258166
really liked that character a lot he's trying to start this whole resistance and that,0.08958254
leads into Thor wanting to start his own group of superheroes called lore Avengers what,0.16267936
I thought was really cute and then even the ending of this movie man it,0.26291844
was not what I was expecting you know I had a whole idea what was,0.08490277
gonna go down and then I was like oh okay I mean you won but,0.1954512
that was a surprise his movie is just full escapism at its finest it's not,0.102408916
trying to connect what it's saying in a movie two things are happening in the,0.061700605
real world except for maybe a little subtle metaphor about immigration all the way down,0.11799761
to a song called immigrations on this movie issues all about going in shutting off,0.21040663
the rest of the world being in this fantasy world seeing all the action seeing,0.1748311
Thor fight scene Factory fight see and hope though crazy seeing all these action and,0.3025744
colors and and powers and all that kind of stuff this is a pure escape,0.080930516
film and you know what there's nothing wrong with that this feels like the types,0.092898354
of movies that they were trying to make as action films back in the day,0.05755289
but they just didn't have the budget or the story or no one cared enough,0.058838844
to try to make it good like seriously I want everybody that worked on Thor,0.097698554
Ragnarok to now make a Masters of the Universe movie like if y'all could do,0.09568644
he-man like you do Thor I would be a happy happy person and then get,0.29364055
on Thundercats while you're at it and SilverHawk to the finish of the trilogy now,0.066499844
for the bad like I said this movie is super super funny so funny though,0.1715752
that sometimes the more dramatic stuff kinda doesn't have as much strength as it should,0.0846359
it's really good stuff and an instrumenting stuff and what I do like about the,0.05395783
movie is that when it does get into some of the more heavier stuff usually,0.06597045
with hella it does kind of stop the jokey jokes it really makes it clear,0.19616508
this is bad and this needs to be stopped but I think that in a,0.14128958
movie that maybe wasn't as humorous that might have had a little bit more weight,0.18815175
to it than it does in this movie the tournament stuff it makes sense why,0.06254714
that super humorous and fun and action-packed because it's a tournament of Fighters and it's,0.1958604
the crazy world is and you got Jeff Goldblum what do you expect but the,0.35200095
hell of stuff I think is something that's also very good too in a different,0.26244748
way as much as I like it and as good as it is in this,0.08672797
movie in a weird way I kind of do wish it was a movie or,0.13208653
a character that got established in earlier Thor movies and luckily like I said with,0.062935546
the direction they were able to make it all seamlessly feel like the same movie,0.059676025
but I feel like there's something they could have done more with hella they really,0.15405819
kind of introduced this whole storyline because her story is interesting and her reason for,0.052920613
doing what she's doing is not only these cases with a villain kinda has a,0.23464471
point I was doing something that I was told was okay and right for so,0.0574395
long then all of a sudden I'm wrong and I'm banished so therefore I got,0.18198292
some vengeance to take out and I can respect that I mean I'm not saying,0.18515855
I side with the villain I'm just saying that I kind of get where she's,0.24085881
coming from a little bit so to see her story kind of go from start,0.14881949
to finish in this movie you know I wished that she was like Loki where,0.16975208
we would have met her early and we could have seen the progression of her,0.06899128
and her vengeance or anger towards Thor towards Odin along the way maybe there would,0.24120328
have been a moment where Loki and hella kind of teamed up and worked together,0.15023187
and then hella getting to a point where even look he was like I can't,0.15551488
roll with that and that could have been interesting you know for all that time,0.059371945
we spent with them elves that we're never gonna see again and Thor the dark,0.09835786
world that could have been a moment to be like hella could have been a,0.20873785
part of that you know that's what I'm saying I think maybe the second movie,0.07282634
could introduce or has something to do with hella that could have culminated to this,0.14910826
movie dealing with that as well as a tournament because I feel like that she,0.1648269
was a great villain that we're now kind of done with maybe who knows you,0.32490608
know Marvel will always find a way they need to bring her back but look,0.1458697
like she's pretty done like I said Schiff was nowhere to be found they don't,0.18889144
even explain why she's gone and Jane Foster Natalie Portman dang talked about just give,0.19714752
it up on something you had two movies where you made pretty much a large,0.107612476
part of the movie about Thor pretty much leaving his life to be with this,0.10027261
one woman that he loves so much and the third movie that he's like yeah,0.27374554
they broke up and that's it and it's not even for Mike lore or Loki,0.10068798
it's from like some fan some random person comes up the doors like oh you're,0.13613223
Thor can I take a picture by the way sorry did your girlfriend broke up,0.31089434
with you by I'm like that's it that's how you Andale somebody's you forced me,0.3321531
to watch you made me sit through that for two movies for the third movies,0.15271422
go yeah that's over why couldn't Ella meet her be like hey let's not Natalie,0.19755457
Portman yeah nothing that's wrong that's nice wrong that I shouldn't want Jane Foster dead,0.28312942
that's a really terrible thing to say but it'd be pretty cool Dov you want,0.15865697
it Helena get Thor upset that'll be a way to do it I'm just trying,0.053228788
to add a little bit more drama to your comedy where's kat dennings and now,0.1424339
by the nerd yeah God had that Stan Lee cameo it's a good one well,0.38330016
we also get another cameo from another Marvel hero that you might remember I don't,0.11157921
know that's a Doctor Strange song or the guild theme song it was fun to,0.085620895
see Doctor Strange and Loki kind of go head-to-head while in the battle Loki had,0.1324374
to go grab something for Thor and he's notices that tesseract is still under there,0.10163231
and they don't ever show him taking the tesseract but I think it's pretty safe,0.07927784
to assume he took it you know you can't trust Loki how in three movies,0.15632558
and the Avengers does Thor not realize stop trusting Loki I know he's your brother,0.117789835
but I got some family members and I love to but I don't keep my,0.08363035
wallet and plain sight around them cuz I know you get a funny after credit,0.1287128
scene with Jeff Goldblum at the very very end and you get a very interesting,0.119783625
scene in the mid credits where Thor and Loki they've got a bunch of people,0.08643173
in the ship everything is cool and then this much much bigger ship just shows,0.060727
up and they don't show who's in that ship but I'm gonna have a good,0.10434323
guess that probably involves a big purple being with a really cool blinged out gauntlet,0.06427591
I think the infinity war is about to begin I do like the movie I,0.1503005
really think it's fun in this movie being a little over hyped right now maybe,0.10336791
if you want to sense the best door yet I'm all about that I could,0.091021396
believe that but best Marvel film I can't go that far but overall this is,0.0904478
just a fun freakin film so those are my thoughts on Thor Ragnarok what did,0.45515448
you think if you saw the movie or do you plan on seeing the movie,0.086374074
