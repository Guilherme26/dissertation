[Music] either guys how are you so before we dive into the movie review of get out I first want to talk about a very sensitive subject racism because in one way or another this one we does deal with racism and I want to give you my quick thoughts on the subject in life people are people there's a lot of cool people that you meet along the way that come in every shape in color and there's a lot of [ __ ] heads that you meet along the way that come in every shape and color and to wrap up my thoughts my motto is people are like Sour Patch Kids they come in every color but no matter what they're all delicious did I just compare sour patch kids to racism at six o'clock in the morning let's talk about the movie get out a black guy meets his white girlfriend's creepy and mysterious family the movie get out as a horror mystery thriller so spent with a heavy dose of comedy and going into this movie I had no idea how heavy-handed this movie was with a comedy throughout and at times it is very subtle and I appreciate very subtle comedy because in my opinion that makes things even funnier letting the film get out there's very intense serious situations where one of the characters just makes an offhanded comment that's funny that relates and makes sense during the situation but you as an audience laugh at it because it adds a certain level of levity and I liked that about this movie but as far as comedy goes the main characters best friend named rod is pretty much the main comedic relief of the movie and there's three or four scenes where he references crazy white people kidnapping them eating their heads and using them as sex slaves and I was like yeah I that's funny so like I said before the main plot of this movie is a white girlfriend takes her black boyfriend home to meet her white parents and everyone in this family is very eccentric very weird and creepy and you just get this vibe that something bad is looming it's a very suspenseful film I was really on the edge of my seat at times wondering what's going to happen how's this all going to turn out and along the way you're laughing at the sad tires and the stereotypes that the movie is making fun of when it comes to the writing of this film I thought the most clever thing it did was you'd expect all these white old crusty people to be racist no one comes across truly racist in this film yes they do stereotype things but no one really makes a ray this remark the white family in the film actually goes so far as to say that black people are genetically gifted and they're almost envious of that and when it came to that approach I was actually surprised by that because I was expecting a very cliched we're old white people we don't like black people and I thought by flipping things around and making them envious of them for certain reasons which I can't spoil I was like yeah that's pretty clever I like that two thumbs up and I guess when it comes down to I'm just glad there's something slightly original still left in Hollywood and this movie is a breath of fresh air it blends a lot of different elements together to give you something unique and something that you haven't quite seen before but still giving you the things that you want to see in a film especially a horror film the thriller aspect the suspense with the sad tire in the comedy it's all these great things blended together to make an entertaining movie is it perfect no so let's talk about that for the first three forces movie I was really on the edge of my seat I was buying into the hype the suspense the build-up I enjoyed the characters in the story and I was really getting hyped for the climax of the movie and maybe it's because I've seen one too many movies in my life but just judging by the trailers of this movie I essentially guessed how the movie would end and it's not like I guess every single detail of the ending of the film but the general outcome just watching the trailers I could watch those and be like yeah it's probably going to go this direction and it does and is that necessarily a bad thing no but I was just hoping that the movie might have a twist to where you couldn't guess just watching the trailer like I said the first three fourths of the movie are very clever I really enjoyed the build up but once you get the payoff to everything I thought it came across a little bit silly it sort of has this made-for-tv sci-fi channel vibe going on I thought I got a little bit too convoluted for its own good and I almost feel like the movie took too much of a physical approach to the ending of the film I thought if it was more of a psychological approach with everything being inside of your head I thought that would have been a little bit more interesting and believable as far as action goes I thought the main actor who played Chris the main character of the film did a great job with playing this very subtle down-to-earth guy who is just he felt like a dude in this weird situation and I couldn't help but think hey if I was just this guy in this situation that's probably the same kind of things I would be doing too now my final flicking thoughts of the movie get out at times this is a funny comedy satire film at other times it's a very creepy thriller suspense aurifil and the biggest praise I can get this move is it blends all those different genres together to give you something new and original and it's also entertaining but as far as the overall writing and directing go I liked it this movie's self-aware at times I like the Kombi aspect of it but one of my favorite things about this movie is throughout this movie there's so many little intricate details that characters and sayings and events that happen that don't make any sense until the final conclusion of the film and I absolutely love when a movie gives you a payoff like that to where all these little minor plot details finally add up into something bigger and this is by far the best horror film I've seen on the theatres of 2017 yeah so I'm going to give get out and the more I think about it it is a very clever film it's very suspenseful I enjoyed watching the movie now here's my question to you guys let me know down below if you've seen the movie what did you think about it or what is your favorite twist ending from a horror film and like I said people are like Sour Patch Kids keep that in mind as usual guys thanks for watching and if you haven't already make sure you subscribe that way I can see you next time [Music]
