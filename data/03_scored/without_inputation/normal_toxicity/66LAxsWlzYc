hey everyone its Rihanna and welcome back to another video so today I am so,0.10347335
excited to be talking about giving mo de Torres new film the shape of water,0.10237619
which I was highly anticipating Gilliam auditorium is one of my favorite directors working today,0.041105762
he brings such new fresh creative ideas at to the film industry and they always,0.028799376
bring the original stories which is why I love him Gilliam Editora has never once,0.13274248
let me down as a director so let's see if the shape of water is,0.083438724
as good as his previous films once upon a time during the cold war a,0.11700775
mute woman named Eliza played by Sally Hawkins works in a scientific experimental facility and,0.17821334
one night they get a new asset in the facility and Eliza goes to investigate,0.05306361
and finds a c-like creature who is also very human-like in a pool tank now,0.29897568
Eliza finds a unique connection between her and the sea like creature the fact that,0.11748649
she can't speak in the fact that he can't speak gives her the much-needed communication,0.14299564
that she is craved for her whole life she's always felt alone as a human,0.26707062
and they start to form a friendship now the first thing that struck me about,0.1457604
the shape of water was at the world that Gilliam auditory sets his film in,0.06152074
obviously it's set during the Cold War there is tension between the Russians and the,0.1279277
Americans and it's a very fantastical world obviously we have a scene like creature living,0.5154597
in it and obviously in the real world we would not see that but also,0.08183008
the use of colors and music and just overall the whimsical atmosphere of the film,0.04527264
it definitely makes it otherworldly but also very much set in our time which is,0.041070323
what I've always loved about Gilliam Otara him setting fantastical stories in the real world,0.075749315
it's not such a complicated world that he has to build around it but it,0.117525905
is very very effective it's a very dark story but it's also filled with bright,0.103755
colors and whimsical music the world is obviously helped out by the production's line and,0.08599417
at the cinematography and overall the aesthetic of this film is just beautiful the deep,0.09624566
greens and blues that used in this film are just gorgeous it is very pleasing,0.15434559
to look at I would expect nothing less from giving a model tour Oh since,0.07525564
he makes nothing but beautiful films so let's get down to the characters of the,0.3086596
film our main character is in woman named Eliza Sally Hawkins gives a fantastic performance,0.11563511
here she's strong and powerful and emotional just by using her actions obviously she can,0.117408864
use her voice in her acting which I found phenomenal I could really sympathize with,0.18178207
and relate to the character of a live out which just is incredible I really,0.027103174
am rooting for her in next year's Oscars because obviously she's mute there's a lot,0.12901051
of use of sign language in this film which I really really like it's very,0.08805386
rare to see the use of sign language in such a big production of filmic,0.14885901
but I thought it was really really effective considering her and this creature could communicate,0.1532281
through sign language Michael Shannon plays the bad guy mr. Strickland who is incredibly scary,0.44974238
he's very disturbing and creepy but if anyone can pull that off it's Michael Shannon,0.29301524
he has one of those very creepy faces so we have a powerful performance and,0.31089434
a scary performance but we also have some married comedic performances here especially from a,0.08143681
Tobias Spencer who plays the character of Zelda who is Eliza's work colleague she had,0.058210127
some of the best lines that she was just hilarious it's very reminiscent of her,0.18582733
role in the help her characters are very similar and another comedic performance was of,0.032744423
Richard Jenkins as Eliza's neighbor Giles I thought he was great in the film I,0.07525046
really loved his character all of these characters were so well fleshed out that I,0.083491504
just think the writing for them is incredible and obviously as this sealant creature we,0.15126473
have Gilliam Editora alumni Doug Jones who always gives a fantastic performance even if he,0.077002145
is under a latex costume him and Sally Hawkins have this really strange connection and,0.13916512
they really bring it to the characters it's just fantastic I think the film looking,0.053287763
so beautiful wasn't enough the creatures line is something sent from the heavens above it,0.18437615
looks so real and realistic it is in competition with things like the Apes in,0.2665663
the Planet of the Apes trilogy I really do think Hollywood need to learn a,0.29337633
thing or two from Guillermo de Torres creature design because when he did the big-budget,0.127235
blockbuster film Pacific Rim the design of the kaiju sand the jaegers were incredible and,0.06834997
let's just face it things like transformers pirates the Caribbean anything that involves a big,0.21509624
huge monster thing needs to step up the game if they want to compete with,0.31089434
Guillermo de Toro with any other Gillian motor Tori films this story is one the,0.07472269
bazaar it's quite light-hearted compared to his other films especially Pan's Labyrinth which I think,0.11006022
there's definitely a similarity between the two because it is set in the real world,0.10735167
in a real time but the shape of water just has something very whimsical about,0.057872117
it I keep using that word but it is very very true because the film,0.07201892
is light-hearted and funny but also incredibly dark I think the film kind of struggled,0.0990733
with its tone considering there are so many genres here we have fantasy comedy kind,0.15404624
of thriller horror elements in here at the end of the film somehow Gilliam auditoria,0.106393084
has worked his director magic and weave them together perfectly Gilliam auditorio I just am,0.050358444
so in or of him he is such a fantastic director he can do no,0.14105348
wrong in my eyes the shape of water is another fantastic film by him I,0.11636463
can't wait to see what he does next I seriously think this is Guillermo de,0.106431
Torres best film it's since Pan's Labyrinth and I cannot wait to see it again,0.09657806
although I will not be seeing again till February next year because that's when it's,0.06917633
officially released in the UK oh that makes it sound like I illegally watched it,0.14886284
which I absolutely didn't I saw it at the BFI London Film Festival and people,0.05856375
clapped after and usually I would never clap after a film but I had to,0.049215615
clap for this it's definitely a cinematic experience Gillian wonder toy fans are going to,0.15439908
love it it's not gonna be a film for everyone it is quite bizarre and,0.08890104
