things about roma Roma is epic it is a gigantic and majestic film and it,0.04853579
has to be seen in the cinema this thumb was shot on the digital equivalent,0.07087798
of 70 millimeter film which is just incredibly wide and big and just epic and,0.050559945
watching Roma was really an epic and awesome experience cinema graphically this film had some,0.024827315
beautiful and captivating moments due to the epic scope of the shooting format some bits,0.29130507
were really beautiful and captivating in terms of staging and Scimitar fee and direction they,0.019075472
were really awesome like this party scene in particular and another scene in the fields,0.027429514
where the camera is panning some shots were very very beautiful but not old alfonso,0.2597545
cuar√≥n shot this film himself and the cinematography at certain parts was really beautiful as,0.18168427
i just mentioned but it's mainly panning shots or static shots and it's really no,0.05342622
Lubezki cinematography so the cinematography isn't particularly incredible or innovative as Lubezki would shoot but,0.11180939
some bits were really powerful and really beautiful apart from the epic nature of the,0.086462565
film itself the other best thing about this film is the sound work there's this,0.039642286
one scene that happens in the ocean where the audience is just fully captivated and,0.02853904
taken over by the incredible sound work of the waves and of the sea which,0.030603103
makes that moment such a real and visceral and scary experience really really amazing sound,0.02738029
work roma is not entirely an autobiographical film the film is based on Afonso Korins,0.013559103
childhood memories of Mexico City in 1970 and 71 and Fonzo had every last detail,0.008314131
reconstructed to as it actually was in those years however there is one moment I,0.022660146
think it's the hospital moment but I'm not quite sure that apparently is actually um,0.021800729
a digital special effect it wasn't actually built so it was digitally reconstructed but everything,0.024963012
else is apparently real and actually reconstructed too as it was at that time Romo,0.026415108
isn't fully an autobiographical film because although there are scenes with supposedly young Alfonso Cuaron,0.037254274
but no child in this family is actually called Alfonso so we just have to,0.02019564
assume that one of the children is Alfonso so there aren't many scenes with a,0.025957461
young Alfonso however the film's plot is really about the indian Servant of Alfonso's family,0.042362887
and most of the film is about her story so because Romo is mainly about,0.019884335
the story of this Indian servant except for Cleo which is her name we don't,0.060730603
really connect that well to the rest of the family and it's really only Cleo,0.03185631
who I actually connected with the other characters I sort of observed them from a,0.01930762
distance really so my main problem I had with Romo is that the film itself,0.035330564
is not that interesting I mean it does captivate you and you want to keep,0.08359429
watching but just the story is not the most interesting ever but some bits cinema,0.042877074
too graphically or narrative Lee were really powerful especially at the end it's really powerful,0.020870136
but overall as a full product it's not that interesting of a film to watch,0.047286574
in my opinion one of the biggest faults of Romo was that it was shot,0.11536746
digitally Romo which is all based on memories should have been shot on film to,0.11429651
have that warmth and that vintage magic feel which the film completely needed and it,0.008755147
being digital it just felt cold had it been shot on film Romo would have,0.060332157
been a completely different and breathtakingly beautiful experience the Russian critic Anton Dolan compared this,0.019680789
film to amarcord and said that it's as good as a Marc Ord for me,0.052075896
that is not so where Mr cord is fully perfect and brilliant in every way,0.024352374
in every shot in every scene Roma is really not like that Roma is just,0.13543405
a film that contains great moments but overall is not that amazing so Roma has,0.041889276
no time our court or even no murmur of the heart and no the squid,0.07972958
and the Whale however it is closer to Louis Malle's aurevoir Ellis on phone in,0.02079497
terms of power those movies are quite similar so in my personal opinion Roma is,0.017095884
not Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece his masterpiece remains children of men which is just absolutely perfect,0.14740536
in every way and one of the greatest things that the cinema has ever given,0.018812058
us so overall Roma is a great and epic product and a really interesting time,0.01912669
capsule of Mexico City in 1970 and 71 thank you for watching and see you,0.02057679
