who has not yet seen movie number six is the cinematography the third man won,0.06014258
the Academy Award for his black-and-white cinematography so of course it's a highlight it's renowned,0.025938837
for its use of Dutch angles shots in which the image is tilted director Carol,0.057787165
Reed did not invent the Dutch angle which first came into use during the German,0.06321506
expressionist era but he was the first to use it so prominently as a storytelling,0.039312355
and mood enhancing device chiefly to convey disorientation but when I think of how the,0.0342829
movie looks it's about more than the Dutch angles the black-and-white photography looks fantastic and,0.11472755

this is something that I never really noticed before I picked up on it this,0.036086213
last time that I watched the movie a couple days ago and I noticed it,0.039769333
right from the beginning the movie starts with an opening monologue featuring Carol Reed's voice,0.024134858
over talking about the old Vienna versus the new Vienna borne out of war the,0.090866745
succession of images we see moves very rapidly reflecting the voice-over but also supplementing it,0.030635698
with images that show the extra meaning behind the words the best example of this,0.027609112
is when read casually refers to amateurs who attempted to get into the cutthroat black,0.4045999

the camera itself doesn't move around much but the editing style of quick cuts and,0.018378358
alternating angles gives an impression of movement and rapid pace number eight is post-war Vienna,0.047458194
I've alluded to this already but it gets its own slot because Vienna is such,0.07653603

is the final scene this is kind of tricky to talk about since it is,0.01573891
the end of the movie and I'm committed to not giving anything away so I'll,0.027478736
just have to be vague I considered slipping a mention of this scene in under,0.060393352
another category but which one under writing because it was such a daringly unexpected realistic,0.02384883
note for a movie to end on in 1949 under editing because of the bold,0.082971014
absence of a cut that would have made the scene in sooner and robbed it,0.13893624
of its effectiveness under cinematography because it's such a beautiful shot with the tree-lined streets,0.13399127

one of the most famous recognizable things about this movie if you don't know what,0.05407278
is if there is here's a picture the story goes that while in Vienna Carol,0.018924475
Reed happened to hear Kara's playing his it there at a party and was so,0.023022005
taken with unique sound that he asked Harris to write the score for his movie,0.01893911
the resulting score was a huge success the third man theme was released as a,0.023937298
single and became a number-one bestseller in both the UK and the US the music,0.032691114
adds so much to the peculiar atmosphere of the movie there's the jaunty main theme,0.04453072
but also the slower more melancholy or pensive music such as accompanies the final scene,0.07285823
and the excited or frantic strumming at key moments like the story the characters and,0.019489216
the lopsided photography the music is slightly off-kilter and unexpected it's just the right kind,0.12240975
of music this movie needed the third man is one of my go-to movies I,0.08139453
