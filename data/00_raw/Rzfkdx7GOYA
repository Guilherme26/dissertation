how's it going everybody this is brian for pop culture crossing and today we are talking about the Philadelphia Story so this movie was released in 1940 and surrounds the story of Traci Lords wedding now Traci is a rich socialite from a very historic rich family in Philadelphia the film features memorable characters great dialogue a complex dramatic though humorous story and great cinematography all the elements that I think you know result in a great movie I think you'll enjoy it and you'll probably want to share it with your friends so the story of this movie is based on Phillip Barry's play and this portrays the final hours leading up to the to the wedding of Tracy Lord she's getting married to a man named George Kittredge and he unlike Tracy was not born into wealth rather he grew into well through his professional progression now the plans for the wedding however are complicated when Sidney Kidd the publisher of a tabloid magazine called spy sends reporter and a photojournalist Holly Connor portrayed by Jimmy Stewart and Elizabeth Embry portrayed by Ruth Hussey to infiltrate the Lord wedding which was being held on the Lord estate and to provide a juicy story for the magazine so because the Lord's are pretty strict and do not like the press especially the tabloids you know it's not easy to get in but the way that they get in is through Tracy's ex-husband CK Dexter Haven who has also worked for Spy magazine and their bonus ares bureau and he plans to introduce Macaulay and Elizabeth to the Lord's as friends of Tracy's brother who works in Argentina and you know knows Dexter as expected yeah all of the workings and elements here for a very dramatic and humorous story to unfold so Dexter's unannounced arrival at the Lord residence you know naturally irritates and distracts Tracy from focusing on the last hours in the last day before her wedding luckily for the lords Tracy her younger sister Diana and Tracy's mother Margaret are very sharp and astute and figure out pretty quickly what's going on here and that McCauley and Elizabeth are not actually friends of her brother genius but are actually tabloid reporters so once the Tracy figures this out she tells Dexter Dexter actually confesses and explains that he's being exploited by Sydney kid the Spy magazine publisher as part of a big blackmail operation that if spy doesn't write a juicy story about Tracy's wedding Kidd will publish a like takedown piece on Tracy's philandering father sets Lord so all this complexity is developing very early on in the movie the film's pace in general is very brisk develops really rapidly and this is largely due to the intricacies of the story and the film itself so because of these factors I definitely recommend if you're watching this for the first time that you watch it with no distractions because you know you want to pick up on all the story beats it's very easy to miss something and if you miss something you know it could you know really alter your perspective of the film as a whole so you really want to be of a sharp mindset when you're watching this now that's not to say that this movie isn't fun because it is a very entertaining maybe to watch you just want to be able to follow the whole story progression and you know keep track of all the details at play here as the story develops Tracy learns that Macaulay is a writer and you know he actually finds his book and really admires the poetry and the proverbs of his writing and this sparks a flirtatious relationship between the two and you know this coupled with the fact that Dexter just shows up and it's you know kind of obvious that he may still like her creates a full-fledged love triangle so you have Tracy in the middle and then you have George Kittredge CK Dexter Haven and Macaulay Connor so Tracy's new emotional state kind of when she starts flirting with Macaulay is really compounded by the fact that her wedding is the next day so not great timing not you know just not a good situation so that really compounds and dramatis Isis the story now the Philadelphia Story is narrative though it is complex is quite engaging as I mentioned briefly and the tone is fairly dramatic as a whole I would say though there are very fun light comedic elements peppered throughout so it's not just dry terse drama it is very light and entertaining so throughout the multi-faceted nature of the story and Tracy's love triangle there are several very important lessons that are clearly communicated and there's particularly see a sequence of several scenes in the second act where these important messages are really vocalized so I want to share these with you just briefly they provide some of this important messaging in the movie I don't consider them to be spoilers pretty much everything that happens following these conversations as spoilers and you know I'm not gonna talk about that because you should watch it but anyways so there three conversations conversation tracy has with Dexter a conversation tracy has with George Kittredge and a conversation tracy has with her father Seth so the first stop you know Tracy you know was raised in this wealthy family she's quite spoiled and frankly acts like a goddess so Dexter notes that because of this she's always had people get her out of her problems she's never had to fix her own problems or anything that she has caused she always has her family come rescue her so because of this Dexter charges Tracy with being a classic narcissist who you know in addition to be a narc to being a narcissist is very judgmental of others and other the mistakes of others and she herself has her own struggles but she maintains this veneer of protection and you know she acts like she's protected from everyone else and because of this she acts perfect and she thinks she's perfect and acts like this goddess now more importantly Dexter goes even further and says that Tracy will never be a first-class woman until she learns to accept human frailty and weakness now these are you know pretty pretty scathing critiques of Tracy's life here because Tracy just had this conversation with Dexter I kind of opened her eyes to how others perceive err and because of this she now views Kittredge a little bit differently and through kittredges conversation with her it becomes very evident that he does view her as a goddess and it's like perfect statue that he puts up on a pedestal and he has no intention of you know bringing down so this all slightly alters and kind of jars Tracy's perception of Kittredge and you know it becomes very clear that Kittredge well Tracy actually is very concerned that Kittridge may have actually fallen in love with her aura instead of Tracy the human now shortly after this talk you know these conversations are so sequential like boom boom boom and it's like holy cow talk about overwhelming insane conversation so this final talk between her father Seth and Tracy happens leading up right into this final party the night before the wedding and Seth just curtly and bluntly explains that Tracy possesses everything that she needs to be a lovely woman except an understanding heart and you know Seth's observation as well as Dexter's observation complement each other and that she's not understanding she's you know doesn't accept human weakness she kind of and because of that she thinks of herself as you know above everyone else and these observations from Seth and Dexter are clearly juxtaposed by kittredges just obsession with her being a goddess and him just like worshiping her however Tracy doesn't want to be venerated and worshipped she just wants to be loved like a human like everyone else keep in mind there's this love triangle going on and then everything else happens and the third act is full and replete with drama and humor so I'm not gonna spoil how the movie pans out here I'm just gonna set this up note some of these important lessons here and hope that you watch the movie and experience it for yourself because I think you're really missing out if you don't now the performance performance is of the entire cast is just terrific across the board so in terms of the principles Cary Grant CK Dexter Haven is very well done he's a very calm and collected character though he's sensitive and he communicates that very well you get a good sense of Dexter's past and his previous marriage to Tracy and Grant is great in communicating the emotions felt by dexstar you know very convincingly Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord is very skillfully acted now Tracy's developmental character art is great and impressive and notable and this speaks to both the writing as well as Hepburn's ability to accurately portray this James Stewart and Ruth Hussey hussies portrayal of Macaulay Connor and Elizabeth imbrie or in breed rather are very well acted as well and a sharp wit of these two characters especially and just the expert way in which they deliver them there is a very memorable they have a lot of great one-liners it's just you know beside observations that some of the audience may be thinking but they kind of say it now John Howard's George Kittredge is also very compelling performance Howard does a great job of showing the Kittredge was not born into the wealth like Dexter or Tracy rather he grew into it he was a coal miner and then he rose through the ranks became a manager of a coal company and because of this he is still kind of on the outside so he there's a lot of like the upper privileged class that he doesn't really understand and that he's learning that through Tracy and the Lord's and I think that this element helps make Kittredge a more realistic character if it weren't for Kittredge Macaulay or Elizabeth you know the movie would just be full of these super opulent rich people and the majority of the audiences don't have points of references or touchstones for that so these those three characters and you know Dinah's character the younger sister especially make it more you know more realistic and connects more with the audience themselves lastly virginia wheelers Dinah Lord is you know Tracy's younger sister is the most enjoyable character in the movie I think just dinah likes dexter she doesn't like Kittredge and she's not you know happy about this whole marriage thing at all and though she is young she's very perceptive very self-aware and she actually connects a lot of the dots of you know what's happening between the characters before the adult characters themselves are able to see and realize what's going on and you know this keen awareness coupled with her dramatic antics just adds to the characters charm and you know this type of the character actually really reminds me of Maura Wilson's Susan Walker in Miracle on 34th Street and that they are very young but they're wise well beyond their years and you know their observations and opinions go toe to toe with the adult characters and wheeler does a great depiction of this and a spot-on in her performance so the Philadelphia story's production design and cinematography are all so well done and you know they are worth noting frankly the set pieces particularly the pieces around the lordís state and residents are very well done and well realized and these set pieces complemented with the cinematography and the tight tight nature of the shots and just how the shots themselves are composed really make it immersive and make the audience feel like you are actually a fly on the wall on you know in the Lord residence watching this entire thing unfold it's actually really impressive how it's the production design and the cinematography are executed now George Cukor's direction of the Philadelphia Story is frankly nothing but masterful he is able to seamlessly translate this complex story and originally play into cohesive type film and the final product is just clear evidence of Cougars ability to expertly manage the production the cinematography the music and expert ability to bring about very very great convincing performances from his entire cast and as such tell a quite touching story so I've seen the Philadelphia Story numerous times and each time I see it it seems like I pick up on something new and this is a testament of robust storytelling and directing now this movie I highly recommend it I think it's a great go to movie if you're looking you know for something that's complex though touching and has you know romantic and dramatic elements mixed with light
