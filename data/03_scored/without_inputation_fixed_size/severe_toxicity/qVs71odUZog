take meticulous notes back then but there was just absolutely no way i was reviewing,0.018243326
a movie over a year after seeing it good news though one i did get,0.058220863
to see the movie again and even better news now the movie's still excellent you,0.02412089
all know how it can be with sequels especially when you have an original movie,0.02812729
that winds up being such a hit and success like that 2018 film you worry,0.05690247
that making a sequel could maybe be pushing it too far and it can't possibly,0.062404867
be as good as that first one right in this case though i really think,0.044100344
it is the bulk of the story here takes place immediately after the events of,0.018977689
that first film with the remaining members of the abbott family hitting the road after,0.13077244
lee's death while out there they wind up with killian murphy's character emmett and you,0.388852
know what i'm just going to leave it at that that's really all you need,0.06955692
and i don't want to come anywhere close to spoilers on this one focusing on,0.046634696
story structure first here i kind of can't get over how well krazynski made it,0.04648769
work and in so many ways too for example part two very much felt like,0.021375012
a major step forward for the main characters and also a big step forward in,0.021259269
the world building department and in how it fleshes out the state of the world,0.08495726
it is also very well worth noting here that krazynski opts to spend a good,0.034966044
chunk of time in the past and with that material i'll just tell you that,0.021857934
i jotted down a particular sequence in the film as a potential contender for one,0.026941268
of the best set pieces of the year and it doesn't feel like a a,0.041335177
hold on let me remind you what happened kind of moment it is exceptionally well,0.043111883
shot first of all and also perfectly paired with what we're dealing with and what,0.26819783
the characters are going through in the present the other thing i really appreciated about,0.015129602
how everything plays out here is how evelyn regan and marcus are are all on,0.023879427
their own journeys in a sense even more so than in the first film it,0.053931095
is a lot for one movie to handle but krazynski pulls it all off via,0.036255833
the script and then also in editing and i'll just tease that the editing really,0.02857895
shines in the third act there is one particular scene where you could just feel,0.02663994
the structural choice that they made making all the difference in that moment just bringing,0.016866397
together the themes of the film and the character growth and dare i say that,0.00880038
particular beat is kind of perfect i think it's perfect and then we've also got,0.12278093
to talk about the sound design here again i mean this movie better earn another,0.0140786115
academy award sound nomination if you saw the first film this won't come as a,0.041120987
surprise at all the design enhances all of the scares and also bolsters every single,0.07166156
character's experience it is just endlessly exciting to me when you can hear every single,0.014383931
stitch of sound in a movie used with such purpose i will continue risk sounding,0.08004887
like a broken record here by telling you that hey the cast is stellar yet,0.03097095
again emily blunt no surprise is wonderful but by design this is millicent simmons and,0.060325503
noah jups movie the two of them went through so much in that first film,0.045247786
but jupe in particular has some really gut-wrenching moments in this one and i felt,0.09811525
for him he is such an incredibly expressive actor who's giving so much every single,0.17345196
second he's on screen and obviously that ability well supports what marcus is building towards,0.031266958
in these two films and then i just can't give millicent simmons enough credit for,0.06306673
how good she is in both of these movies but here in part two she,0.03914672
is just a damn star i don't want to take away from the quality of,0.40692735
her work in that first film at all because she certainly wowed me there but,0.037695955
part two gives her even more to do that elevates her from being a very,0.041154247
important part of an incredible ensemble to really being a significant force driving the whole,0.03957111
thing forward as for the aliens you do see them more in this one and,0.051636875
while i think the design is really solid admittedly again i did have that moment,0.018138228
of going oh they kind of look like a demogorgon but i think that fades,0.11906854
in a flash because you do have some really solid vfx here and also a,0.040999923
movie loaded with super rich characters with an intensely powerful emotional core if those characters,0.038417682
believed in them so did i and that made a bit of a nitpick admittedly,0.0649186
like similarities and character design just a fleeting thought for me i'm going to go,0.023154378
ahead and give a quiet place part two four and a half dewey's out of,0.066562265
five on the dewey decima movie scale i think i am uh fully obsessed with,0.12709332
this series yet again i walked away from this movie appropriately exhausted some of the,0.028398685
scenes in part two are probably the most stress inducing scares i've seen in a,0.021957712
good while and you guys know me i do love my scares and my sky,0.0950441
high tension but the real standout quality of a quiet place part two and something,0.050195422
that i do think all sequels need is is how it takes a step forward,0.029147018
thematically and also with such purpose that first movie largely focuses on the immediate family,0.0060851
raising kids and giving them everything you've got and now this one shows the results,0.054082755
of a strong parent-child relationship and what a kid can do with the values passed,0.0226209
down by a parent or a guardian figure and then maybe how they can use,0.024584522
those values and those qualities to benefit others as well clearly i think this movie,0.035111055
was incredibly well done i highly recommend you see it and when you do hit,0.10728614
