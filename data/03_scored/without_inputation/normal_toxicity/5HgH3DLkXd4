it's a good week to be an Amy Adams farm,0.09176404
arrival is the latest film by Denis Villeneuve who previously directed prisoners a very good film and Sicario an even better film in my mind and the rather overlooked enemy which is also a very good film,0.0625035
starring Jake Gyllenhaal who appeared this week in another film with Amy Adams who stars in this film a very good film itself that film is nocturnal animals check it out if you haven't seen it but a rival as I say another very good film starring Amy Adams Adams plays the character of Louise banks who is an expert in linguistics and she's drafted in by the military when twelve alien spacecraft land on earth at various different places around the planet she's given the task of basically trying to decipher the language that is spoken by these alien creatures and find out the answer to the question,0.101818785
why are they here her character also seems to have this tragic past in which she was divorced from her husband and then her child contracted some kind of rare disease which eventually took that child's life,0.12214952
I'm just going to say a few things about this film what I thought about it,0.11221832
and then towards the end I'm not just gonna do spoilers I'm gonna feel like this is the kind of film,0.091990724
I need to in order to fully get to grips with the themes,0.06874812
and what what it's actually all about but don't worry I won't go straight into them,0.31282434
I will let you know when I'm gonna do spoilers,0.14917238
so you can turn off if you need to as I say right off the bat denis villeneuve killing it once more Sicario was in the top ten of last year prisoners as well as really great film,0.32600087
and I'm really looking forward to his take on Blade Runner but this is equally a great film to film about ideas,0.064087
and it's a film about humanity and pain loss and love basically and beautiful moments kind of mixed in with painful moments,0.15534088
and how yeah you got to take the rough with the smooth,0.14918336
it's a very slow-moving film it takes a while to kind of get to where it's going to there's a moment when they first get into the ship when Amy Adams character,0.15014555
and character played by Jeremy,0.036745343
he was a scientist who they team up with her to basically go in the ship and make contact with these aliens and that whole scene where they're getting inside the ship,0.17554814
it does take a while and I got to say it's a little laborious that is really my only kind of down on the film it's just it's just those moments,0.14470784
it takes a while to get going,0.08951827
but once you get into it,0.077093974
this is a film about ideas,0.10275456
as I say in about humanity,0.15772617
because these alien,0.23976782
ships have London to all these different places around the world different countries are dealing with them in their own unique way,0.10661826
so you've got like China whose are prepared to go to war,0.36528367
and then you've got four other countries who are like kind of following suit with them,0.06969481
they're they're prepared to follow China's lead and then you've got other countries who are trying to do it in a peaceful,0.0924978
manner trying to get to grips with what's going on and then you've got other countries that are too busy thinking about what other countries are doing,0.084519036
so that's causing a lot of political kind of strife,0.26948315
so yeah it's it's a very good film that deals with what would actually be the effects of aliens coming down to earth while we have all that while we have that kind of global scale about the film it's a very big picture story,0.10411693
it is also a very intimate film,0.21669278
and he's really all about this character played by Amy Adams,0.07043735
so we we kind of follow her personal story we see these flashbacks that she has to her child to losing her child to losing her husband and it grounds that film it grounds it in a very personal intimate story,0.14931919
this is a much warmer performance here by Adams than the previous week's film,0.08622459
nocturnal animals like I said with that film she had a bit of an uphill struggle because the character wasn't a very easy character to like on the page,0.16779858
but she did very well with it to actually make us sympathize with her here however right off the bat,0.25647134
we sympathize with her you know when you start a film with your main character losing their child,0.39494836
that's it you're on their side,0.08679795
so yeah she's definitely a much easier character to like here and her performance as always with Adams is absolutely spot-on,0.08490156
jeremy,0.050995983
renner also offers typically brilliant support is an actor who I don't often think of and I'm thinking of really great actors,0.080661975
but then when I look at his career when I look at some of the films he's done he is actually a really great solid actor,0.08780136
he does a very good job of showing this man who's falling for this woman that he's working with but because he respects her and it's not like an overblown kind of look story,0.2397123
we don't get into the typical romance tropes that you get in other films there's just a lot of subtle moments that kind of builds this relationship of respect between the two film does a really good job of holding the mystery of keeping you guessing,0.07660083
it's one of them films where you kind of get 2/3 of the way through of it,0.18742828
and then you start to kind of panic because you like if it just keeps on going this way and then just suddenly ends if it's one of those films where it's gonna demand a second watch and a third watch and fourth watch just to start to get to grips with it,0.109529
then yeah duck that was kind of worrying me because I just wasn't in a stayer mind to be honest but it does tie everything together in the in the last five minutes boom Eureka it all ties together,0.16731702
and you understand the ending,0.1559154
I think if you're not paying attention then it might escape,0.11161058
you you might go away from,0.40336788
yeah you are paying attention then definitely it's a film,0.11746981
you will understand it's easy enough to understand I think so if you're put off by that kind of film by the likes Twin Peaks,0.15403257
you're kind of David Lynch type stuff that is really hard to penetrate don't worry I don't think this is that kind of film I think it does hold mystery throughout but it's all tied up towards the end,0.40702862
ultimately it just feels very real,0.06170609
and I think that's the best way to play sci fi for me personally is is when you can when you can ground it when you can kind of know land ice hit so to speak it just makes it more personal,0.08847088
it makes it more relatable,0.065851286
it doesn't feel so high concept,0.0837396
so out there like I said I did want to go into spoilers and I'm gonna do that now,0.0859667
so if you've not seen the film and you don't want it spoil in go away,0.10701048
come back,0.049851928
later there's a line in the film when Jeremy Renner's character is on a conversation with Amy Adams is character,0.052364446
and they're talking about language,0.04962617
obviously this character Louise played by Adams she is a linguistics expert and she talks about her and Rena talks about how when you learn another language and you start to speak that language,0.10717251
it changes your whole perception of the world it can completely,0.0856345
reorient ate you into a different way of thinking because I did not because you're getting into touch with the way a particular culture speaks I guess that is deliberately set up so that we understand the payoff which is that as the film goes on we start to learn that these flashbacks that Amy Adams character is having that Louise is having and not flashbacks at all they are flash forwards,0.07590992
so she didn't lose her daughter,0.24003042
she didn't get divorced she is going to lose her daughter and she is going to get divorced so by getting to grips with this alien language by being able to speak it that is how she is able to see into the future she's able to look at time not as linear but as nonlinear,0.12603681
so she's able to see moments from all over the place,0.098271154
and know what's coming know what's gonna happen,0.08148593
so we learn at the end of the film that obviously this character played by Rena is the guy who becomes her husband he's the one she's gonna have this child with and he leaves her from what we can tell from the film because she knows what's happening,0.08798403
she's seen it,0.10892594
she knows that this child that they have they're gonna lose and he can't take that he really can't deal with it,0.24002716
and he leaves they they get a divorce,0.105777316
Villeneuve is definitely that we say preoccupied with the darker side of humanity,0.2414245
so I would say that this is his most hopeful film now I've not seen in Sundays I still need to see that film,0.061519638
but from the ones I've seen this is his most hopeful I think because as much as it has its darker elements this whole idea that Louise can see her future,0.078315705
she knows what's gonna happen,0.15535855
it's also filled with hope,0.07193641
it's also filled with beauty,0.0920779
because she essentially makes the choice at the end,0.08314707
they're actually all that pain that I know I'm gonna suffer is worth,0.5226277
it because of the moments of beauty,0.08758085
I'm gonna get with my child with my,0.1990475
unborn child is it worth it that that's the thing if if you know your future if you could wipe out the painful moments from your future and in order to do,0.42859864
so you would have to wipe out a lot of the beautiful moments,0.44214916
and that's the trade-off can you take the rough with the smooth,0.13129336
but there you go a really great film once again by Denis Villeneuve,0.07430157
I don't think it's his best,0.10564595
but when you're dealing with someone like Villeneuve that's not really a diss on the film because he's put out some pretty fantastic work,0.10694281
I still think Sicario is his best I'd probably put this second,0.08911279
I don't know enemy's still pretty good as well but yeah I would give this a 4 out of 5 I'm still torn,0.1506669
I'm I don't have to give it a 4 in half or a 4 I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5,0.081982076
if you've seen a rival please comment below and let me know what you thought about it,0.13523212
and tell me what you think is denis villeneuve best film until next time thanks for watching,0.07677316
