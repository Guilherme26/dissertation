I have always heard about the Marx Brothers I've always seen little parodies of them in a lot of TV shows I love like Animaniacs and pinky in their brain,0.40118405
they're just a part of American culture,0.1457746
and I had very limited exposure to them,0.081884824
and now that I saw a Night at the Opera I'm quite sad that I didn't grow up with him because they are so fun and there's a knee and their comedy you find bits of it here,0.14182271
and there that are dated bits that you know I just didn't get jokes that were over my head or referenced things that aren't part of our culture anymore but by and large I would say 99 percent of their humor is still just as good today as it was back then and especially they come from the Depression era and you know where we've just come out of this really really big recession,0.07091614
I think a lot of their their jokes about money and and things like that really really play to us now in a very similar way to the way it did to them to people back then,0.089603886
so one of the first things that you should know about the Marx Brothers is their movies are not for everyone,0.11165235
this is however one of the first movies that they did that really had some meat to it before their act was very vaudeville different little scenarios that they would put together and travel around with this was one of the first movies they did that actually had a significant plot real story to it,0.05531493
if you've ever seen Looney Tunes Animaniacs tiny to any of those types of shows you've seen references to this movie probably a lot of them almost every bit of humor in all of those cartoons comes right out of this movie they do everything you could even think to do with the Opera House as their playground,0.15887351
they go up the fly system,0.04992814
they fly on the backdrops,0.10234682
they do all sorts of crazy stunts on the set one of my favorite moments as they replace the music and all the musicians stands one of the things that I love about this movie and about the Marx Brothers in general is they each fill their own,0.19027384
niche,0.09853661
Groucho has a really sarcastic sense of humor do you follow me yes,0.14740905
well stop following me,0.15441036
all have your essence Chico really has all of his own his own little language his own little accent that he does and he can do puns,0.16383162
he can do just different plays on words and things,0.07837583
it's all right that's in every contract,0.08614282
that's what they call a sanity clause hahahahaha,0.11537834
you can't fool me there,0.4032992
ain't no sanity,0.103395924
clause Harpo does the physical comedy because he never actually speaks everything,0.14908803
he does is over the top physical overly comedic it's amazing something I love about the Marx Brothers is the speeches that usually Groucho miss although really any time he or Chico give a speech,0.06703548
it is hilarious come on I tell you how we fly to America the first time I we started we get a half way of course when we run outta gasoline and we got to go back,0.1395854
but joy be unconfined,0.08319425
let me be dancing in the streets drinking in the saloons and necking in the parlor,0.25435218
but one of the other truly significant things about these brothers is that they're all super talented musically,0.09240901
they all do really great things,0.061348815
they don't always utilize that in their movies,0.08650833
but they are amazing when you sit them down with their instrument that they're really good at there's a song that Harpo plays and I'm not a hard player but I've never seen the harp used the way he used it it was really really neat,0.1062427
there's a little gag number they do on the piano that again,0.105167866
it was just it was musical humor,0.049869344
it's in a way i'd never seen it's very very smart but it's also incredibly impressive they're not phoning it in they're not giving it half of their effort,0.09957292
they are totally bringing intense talent to every minute of those musical numbers and it's it's fabulous,0.10315269
one of my favorite scenes is the contract scene Groucho and Chico are talking about contracts for their clients and what to include and what not to include,0.06079339
and that's really where you get to see how well they're different types of humor connect how well they can play off of each other,0.0591635
while Groucho is being very dry and very sarcastic,0.15576284
you have Chico who is doing the play on words and that scene I've never seen anything quite like it where two people were doing two different styles of comedy and it was working,0.116712876
so well it was connecting so well a big favorite of most everybody who's seen this movie is the stateroom scene it's called that because he has this little tiny cabin on a cruise ship and it's a statement and so grouchos in there and both of the other Marx Brothers and this one other guy in the story they they snuck in in his giant suitcase,0.17796277
so they're in there and he orders dinner so then you get waiters coming in and you get somebody coming in to check the temperature,0.14056367
and then you get the assistant to come in and check the temperature and you get somebody coming in to give a manicure and every single person that comes you keep thinking Groucho is going to say no no we're full,0.1022649
but you keep saying come on in come on in come on in and by the time it's all said and done there's absolute chaos in the room,0.14301543
I think they said there were more than 15 people in that room all at the same time overall,0.106904745
I would give a Night at the Opera,0.09013418
five stars,0.03474367
it's really great fun,0.060455162
it has a really nice little story a really happy ending ties up nicely,0.16995186
I think overall,0.04989054
I think anybody can enjoy this movie as great as this movie is,0.13186668
it's not perfect,0.10506802
it's got its flaws,0.1642484
some of the more technical flaws,0.10788615
you'll see blips in the film from time to time just because that's the way movies were made back then and I guess they didn't have enough coverage,0.05843112
so there are several of those that happen throughout but as far as the content of the film it is just it's fantastic,0.05299669
I would give it between four and five stars,0.048617657
I'm gonna say four stars just because there's a few places right in the middle where it kind of was a little a little slow,0.18288894
and the story kind of disappeared for a few minutes but because of tomorrow's brothers the fact i had a story it all was amazing,0.05498452
so I give it 4 stars but i really want to give it 5 they went,0.051755317
and they toured this show as a vaudeville act first to see how audiences would react to it,0.0647127
and then they made revisions to the script as they went to see what what plate and what didn't play,0.04048332
and as you hear about scenes that were cut and scenes that were kept,0.06598983
it becomes apparent how effective that was as a way to sort of preview the show I in fact the state room scene which is again,0.062842906
it's one of the most classic scenes in the movie if not in all cinema was going to be cut,0.107621156
it just wasn't playing wasn't playing wasn't playing with the audiences,0.06481772
and then one night Groucho ad lived the entire scene his part of the entire scene and the audience just was dying,0.13652931
and that ultimately is the version that ended up in the movie they wrote down what he said this film is considered a classic even by our government,0.08777211
it's in the national film registry,0.06280756
it was actually adopted in in 1993 in case you don't believe me that this movie is amazing,0.15482105
even by today's standards it currently has a ninety-seven percent rating on rotten tomatoes that's better than probably most anything you've seen in years,0.1639718
the two leads in this movie who are actually the opera singers that the whole film kind of revolves around are not actually singers but they sing for themselves which was kind of unique for the day to get two people to sing such intense music who weren't actual professional singers one story that I heard before I ever saw this movie that really kind of sold me on the Marx Brothers humor was they made a movie called a night in casablanca and over a Warner Brothers they heard they were doing this,0.060598314
and they wanted to sue them because Casablanca and so they sent them this letter the cease-and-desist letter and gruff,0.14898941
Joe sent them back a letter,0.07296628
and he said I would just like to congratulate warner brothers on their acquisition of the town of Casablanca,0.10070794
I didn't realize you owned the rights to the whole city consequently we'd like to counter,0.10450969
sue you because we were the Marx Brothers before you were the Warner Brothers and we'd like to sue you for using part of our name in your studio and consequently Warner Brothers did not send any reply,0.19198228
and the suit was dropped many of you who enjoy the Marx Brothers sense of humor on the screen might like to know that they had kind of a similar personality off the screen when they were called in to their producers office for a meeting,0.1022426
and he was running late they ended up taking off all of their clothes and piling up all of his office furniture up by his fireplace like as they were burning,0.19551626
it to keep warm,0.12058086
he ended up being about three hours late for that meeting,0.10462285
but he was never late again,0.08982729
