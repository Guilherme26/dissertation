it's not a lot it's net,0.081471
I kept putting off and I was our needs to see this movie and I finally went to go see it,0.13100076
this is being directed by Guetta Greta Gerwig which I've never heard of before,0.09384346
she is mostly known as an actress,0.13197514
she has 40 acting credits as of dogs which is a Wes Anderson film which comes out next year 20th century women Jackie she did some other stuff but as far as directing a film and this is our second film that she's directed she did something called nights and weekend as I came out in 2008 and I did not see that either the main titular character in this movie is and I feel like I should know her name miss Ronan,0.15282899
I don't know how to serese,0.21297832
I don't know how to set and then Ronan and then you know we have a mother Lloyd make half play by marrying my first sin,0.24193773
yeah I'll just go ahead and say this this movie was not for me,0.115364335
it was not not sending us,0.06505594
a bad movie but it is not for me,0.14737125
and as I was watching it,0.06989704
I was just kind of sending myself okay,0.107957534
I really don't see what all the fuss is about why everybody is,0.067595616
so in love with this movie,0.091060184
but you know our films are subjective and just because somebody likes something and I didn't care for it as much doesn't mean anything and vice-versa,0.098570816
if you I didn't like I said I didn't read in the reviews,0.079646885
but if you gotta Rotten Tomatoes right now this has a 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and it's not just to people to felt the way well it has a 159 reviews on here whatever 159 fresh zero run,0.17708594
so what that means is that doesn't mean that everybody who saw this thinks it's a perfect ten ten ten because what's what's considered fresh on,0.05689643
Rotten Tomatoes is a six in above like a six out of 10 and above I believe it may be a five point five out of ten in the book but I think we're gonna just say six for this review,0.23988067
so that at the very least everybody liked the film and thought it was at least a six out of ten or above and of course I'll get tomorrow rating a little bit later,0.0956261
but what the movie is about is it just about a girl in 2003 to the 2002-2003 she lives in Sacramento California and she is just not happy with her life,0.10390131
she feels that it is boring,0.27831233
she feels that it is dull,0.3917997
and she just wants to get up and explore and she wants to go live in New York,0.07100507
that's where she wants to go to college,0.07639856
it's her senior year and she of course out of listen or whatever,0.13637562
so she's in high school you know they people start having sex and all that and the main driving force of this movie is the relationship that she has with her mother like I said it's being played by Laura MEC have no what the film did do right is giving a true interpretation,0.4921298
of what a teenage girl somewhere goes to in high school,0.1711347
I'll give I'll give the film that they did a great job their film,0.08666857
also did a great job with the acting did a great job there in the relationship that had that she had with her mother Christine lady Berg my fierson,0.20009667
she has the great,0.08458871
well I want to say a great relationship with her mother,0.37801003
but in the film it was a nice exchange between two or whatever because they they get along but then they don't get along it,0.06105796
this isn't a Shirley at one point,0.065068364
you know they're like arguing in like a thrift store or a store or whatever like blah blah my mom picks out a dressing like two seconds,0.31089434
I know I love it,0.055932507
and so they're just like a lot of back and forth right there,0.06601819
but for the most part I did not care for ladybugs character she was getting on my damn nerves because she was mean she was selfish she was inconsiderate and I can go down the list name and more characteristics to describe her but she wasn't thankful for anything,0.69542736
she was always complaining and stuff like you know her mom and dad like were bending over backwards for her,0.47049624
but she just you know just took everything for granted and we're just whine and complain uh I mean I mean seriously one scene,0.43378335
she didn't like the conversation that her mom was having I mean,0.5154597
and it was kind of something mean that she would say but she jumped out the car and broke her arm you know and I'm just like okay,0.31089434
I don't see the you know,0.1341755
that's a completely unnecessary unless you're in bodily harm or whatever you know but like this movie is only 93 minutes and I was so bored,0.22246735
I could not wait to leave it seemed like this movie was taking forever to end,0.117261514
and like I said the acting was fine you know the relationships was fine it felt realistic but I just didn't care I mean I mean I couldn't relate to any of these characters it wasn't nobody black in it,0.3036242
I mean they had its once talking black guy in it but he didn't even speak,0.68133557
he was in a brand new parking lot or whatever his back turned towards the camera or whatever you know not,0.08250968
and you know I see you know I see a whole ton of films whereas predominantly white people and I'm still able to relate to them,0.3416398
I was not able to relate to nobody in this whole,0.07156829
and this whole thing or whatever,0.06393879
I just I didn't care for her character,0.116218455

her friends brothers sisters people at school,0.12805387
you know she wants you this cat from school,0.25753805

we can't afford it,0.036910817

so I mean I did care for Julie,0.06504932
I yeah I care for Julie but I don't care for nobody else,0.15463112
