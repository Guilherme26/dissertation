I'll just start right off,0.07003355
the bat Wonder Woman is a triumph for the DC EU,0.2798106
and the best DC film since the dark nights no question Wonder Woman hits such a glorious homerun that I almost got out of my seat and started cheering,0.17005803
and this is the darn truth,0.7054748
how does the people of my theater gave the film a standing ovation when the credits started rolling but why well let me tell you when it comes to films that are centered around one character and a vast multiverse,0.12028527
it is imperative that the filmmakers get that character right Wonder Woman is written by Zack Snyder Allan Heinberg and Jason rush and portrayed by gal gadot superbly her entire dynamic screams fish out of water and those types of characters are the ones I find to be easily relatable as Diana Prince walks along the streets of London marveling at the fashion popular at the time or witnesses soldiers coming home from the war battered,0.09174002
and broken,0.058863144
you can relate to her she isn't some experienced veteran who's used to seeing brutality like this or some fashion supernova,0.22829293
she is a minnow in a pond chock full of piranhas,0.5871024
I made no capable of cracking open a can of whoop-ass whenever she feels like it,0.8524818
I might add the characterization of Wonder Woman / Diana Prince is unmatched in this extended universe and that's complemented by gal gadot colossal II charismatic performance,0.107588984
gadot exhibits OnPoint line delivery and excellent displays of emotion,0.11314585
and this is her best work to date in my opinion Chris Pine also put on a great performance as Steve Trevor and the romance between Trevor and Diana was satisfying me in vest and not sappy as the main romance is one of the most common areas where superhero movies fault flat,0.067903355
but not when it comes to this film everyone else put on really good or great,0.14272502
performances with Lucy Davis particularly shining on the flipside of substance the visual / CGI effects were top-notch although there were some parts that boasted uneven CGI specifically the fire,0.055765167
effects however one particular department I'm not single out is the stunt,0.098250866
work the stunts are amazing and something I can appreciate that patty Jenkins does not use varying camera angles to mask the not so spectacular stunt not that that's a bad thing because even the worst stunts were still good that tells you how dedicated Jenkins was to this,0.16865581
project and I dearly hope that she holds more films in the DCE you now back to what I was previously discussing the fighting sequences themselves,0.116594225
are something to,0.024525782
behold,0.043243073
unlike Captain America Civil War where there were some fighting scenes worth complaining about I can't recall one dole moment of action throughout this entire film the action and fighting sequences kept me on the edge of my seat throughout this movie's runtime while the drama rarely ever,0.09369228
lets up deign what agendas is its Wonder Woman just as great as the Dark Knight,0.10465987
no but it does come close,0.080858454
so overall Wonder Woman is a standout among the DC EU not just because it's colorful they're not a depression inducing shade of gray but the film's handling and representation of the iconic titular character is unparalleled one room,0.11096144
/ Diana Prince is both a fierce warrior and a curious individual determined to restore peace to mankind and learn all about the Rays of life as well intensely terrific action a conclusive plot a satisfying main romance and a colorful tone with serious elements all gelled together to form my favorite film of,0.10909179
2017 so far whether you're a longtime fan of the character or recently,0.08356146
introduced you don't get your money's worth and more with the DCE use magnum opus and hopefully this will set an example for the folks at DC and the years to come so with that being said I'm going to give Wonder Woman an eight point four out of 10 stars,0.15394892
