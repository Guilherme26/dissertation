the last like four days i was originally gonna make a video about trapped twitter,0.07903055
meltdown but i just didn't know if my brain cells could handle that so i,0.24260104
decided that due to these dark times of social isolation i would offer up some,0.13004981
some film advice some things that you guys can can watch and too many people,0.05836201
are just popping on netflix and watching the first thing that gets recommended like i,0.12033308
shudder to think about how many people have suffered through love is blind because it,0.13198505
was the first thing that netflix recommended to them and my friends life is too,0.07394743

really is in the tall grass and the kissing booth we definitely don't have time,0.11650297

my best of 2019 video i was on the intercut podcast talking about my favorite,0.08589647
movies of 2019 but i figured that this was actually a good opportunity to talk,0.055377815
about some of those movies because at this point a lot of them are now,0.07869692
available either on streaming services or through rental or even purchasing if you're feeling extra,0.076483935
into it also before we get into this like specific 2019 list i do have,0.08868387
an overall social isolation list on my letter box that i'll have linked down below,0.10225216
so let's start with my absolute favorite of 2019 portrait of lady on fire the,0.41211572
latest from french directoris celine siama this is an incredibly beautiful movie about a woman,0.29027432
who is hired to paint the portrait of another woman who is being unwillingly given,0.1132306
away in marriage it's a beautiful drama romance but it's also just a tragic look,0.15150969
at freedom and a lack thereof this movie essentially has three endings and each one,0.096815564
stabs me in the heart a little bit more until i'm left a crying wreck,0.65494806
in the bell lightbox theater room and the number 28 will never be the same,0.05033263
this is now freshly available on hulu and will be available for rent in april,0.063433714
with the criterion collection has opened pre-orders for it and currently have a 30 off,0.061482325
sale going i believe until april 30th this one might come as a shock considering,0.11813571
how much i do end up making fun of some of the teen related netflix,0.10900473
movies but i really think that this particular movie is very pertinent to our way,0.07609882
of living right now so we are starting off with one of the finest selections,0.06464353
in the teen death romance category it is the movies that make romantic stories out,0.10660703
of teenagers dying potentially started with a walk to remember but has been popularized by,0.09702554
such novels by john green that went on to become things like the fault is,0.095910184
in our stars and most of them are a little bit weird but i'm recommending,0.31089434
five feet apart because even in the movie they're supposed to be six feet apart,0.123167366
which is exactly the life we're living right now if you ain't six feet apart,0.15070178
from the people around you you ain't here to party because you shouldn't be anywhere,0.24836305
to party so it's basically just a story of teenagers that have cystic fibrosis which,0.3441779
is a very serious lung condition uh they can't share their germs so that's why,0.06529064
they have to stay six feet apart and i just think that maybe we can,0.08940015
all learn a little something and honestly in terms of this style of movie i,0.08810794
didn't hate it i actually had a really good time watching it uh before the,0.09121008
year really progressed itself it was like shockingly high on my 2019 list another one,0.10756331
that i thought was shockingly fun was fighting with my family starring florence pugh who,0.16463706
just went on to tear up 2019 and stole all of our hearts with such,0.19956438
heartwarming roles like danny and midsummer i'm not a fan of wrestling so i don't,0.070013665
really know the intricacies of the situation in this movie and the family being portrayed,0.088916786
and i've heard some people complain about it but overall i enjoyed this way more,0.08490174
than i thought i would i remember they announced this as like the secret movie,0.050829403
at last year's sundance and everyone kind of laughed but i had a really good,0.075963266
time watching it 100 would recommend apparently it's available on hulu and you can rent,0.069975555
it touching on some horror related flicks we're going to start with the nightingale which,0.35096622
i do actually have an entire video about my experience last year's sundance it was,0.072485395
kind of a very wild movie experience all things considered and that's actually my third,0.15101276
most viewed video of all time which is kind of crazy it's a very brutal,0.4031377
watch and has a couple of very very rough scenes and i do think there's,0.0791147
some people that aren't going to be able to handle it so depending if you've,0.09130436
kind of experienced different traumas in your life it might be something you want to,0.101453856
look into a little bit more before you watch it but the movie is incredibly,0.24405056
well made it can run a little long i feel like they could have shaved,0.099800214
off some of the time on it but it's definitely worth the watch and if,0.058675133
you want a little bit more spoiler-free information feel free to check my video which,0.2593215
i'll have linked up below this is available on hulu and of course you can,0.114189364
rent it and of course we would not be talking about 2019 horror unless i,0.14544539
took a second and talked about midsomar and if you've seen hereditary you might as,0.07205587
well just continue with arya's mission of putting grief to film and lingering on really,0.07438561
uncomfortable imagery this is probably not the movie to watch with a significant other if,0.086752206
you don't feel like your relationship's going really well or maybe it's like a really,0.13482918
good opportunity to like kick your life in the pants and get yourself in order,0.93232936
i don't know i can't judge you you know swedish summer festival disturbing rituals fantastic,0.22316875
acting stunning visuals beautiful cinematography no one is doing what arya's doing in film right,0.17404087
now and that's probably a good thing because i don't think i can handle any,0.101701565
more than one movie like this a year this should be available streaming on amazon,0.07647517
prime in the usn canada and it's also available through rental first foreign film up,0.048716348
on the dock we're gonna be talking about takashi mike's first love which i've mentioned,0.055305313
a few times before this is one of my favorites coming out of tiff i,0.17076121
absolutely loved it it's a fun over-the-top violent movie about the yakuza feuding with the,0.15552567
chinese gang over stolen drugs and this girl who gets caught up in the middle,0.51315594
and this guy who chooses to help her because he feels like he has nothing,0.31089434
left to lose don't let the title fool you this movie is badass now do,0.6715448
you want a movie with an academy award-winning actress threatening a disney star with a,0.27565226
shard of glass and that disney star then goes on to bite the ear off,0.2290855
a zombie child and the whole thing is happening at a petting zoo in new,0.44690332
zealand of course you do little monsters was one of my absolute favorite movies from,0.45812353
last year and hearing the director talk about his inspiration for making it made me,0.066487394
love it even more academy award winning actress lupe sandiango is trying to keep her,0.1550241
kindergarten class safe from a contained zombie outbreak while simultaneously trying to convince them that,0.24122307
nothing is going on and then the whole thing is just a game we got,0.06466061
blood we got comedy we got taylor swift on the ukulele it's just good fun,0.26127368
and this one is available streaming on hulu and you can also rent it now,0.0838493
the lighthouse is a movie that actually gets better every single time i watch it,0.07552911
another incredibly stylistic horror director david eggers who also did the witch or the vivic,0.5317411
brought us the height of cabin fever and the downside to social isolations and just,0.092406094
being trapped inside this lighthouse while the world outside you falls apart is it a,0.1290097
good idea to watch this movie right now is a little bit too real i,0.20249826
don't know it could actually just give you the perspective that things could always be,0.06562463
significantly worse i did a light review on this video while also talking about parasite,0.50711244
and zombieland 2 and i do actually want to make an entire video talking about,0.3032918
all the different research and the inspiration that went into the script behind this and,0.032309067
all the different work that he does as a director when he makes these stories,0.05518419
we'll probably still do that it'll really leave you wondering about these old sailor tales,0.23995948
how much is true how much is just bad luck and it's also significantly more,0.14940807
hilarious at times than it has any business being and plunges right through your gullet,0.16759665
bursting ye all right have it your way i like your cooking defoe was 100,0.49283367
snubbed by the academy i would definitely recommend the watch now we're going to steer,0.10685128
into some of the more quirky stuff or just the stuff that doesn't necessarily fit,0.057785936
a certain genre and we're going to start off with that with the art of,0.06336144
self defense i don't know what i was expecting going into this movie but it,0.109341905
was absolutely wild it starts jesse eisenberg playing a pretty meek guy who ends up,0.27151704
getting jumped at the start and then goes on to take karate lessons to learn,0.11162677
how to defend himself everything that falls out after this is completely wild but i,0.15358555
do need to do my civic duty and let you know that something happens to,0.061973535
a dog in this movie but there is vengeance i think it's worth a watch,0.17742245
overall if you're in for something a little bit different i believe this is available,0.085369356
to rent all over and it seems to be available on crave for streaming in,0.13379616
canada so maybe hulu in the us next up was one of the most talked,0.103994
of the town last year that some people might not have had a chance to,0.06892558
watch yet and it is uncut gems unfortunately i do think this was recently removed,0.14415553
from streaming on netflix in the us but it is still available in canada and,0.0720115
i think the rest of the world on netflix so you can still watch it,0.09010561
there i'm still planning to do a full video on this movie but my best,0.09882039
description of describing how it feels to watch this is that you think you're starting,0.09264319
a movie with a guy who's just digging a hole and his life's just getting,0.44378284
worse as he digs this hole but then you quickly realize that he was already,0.42766666
five feet in the hole before the movie even started and we're just watching that,0.15279
last foot go down this is an incredibly stressful movie to watch it's like two,0.15199383
hours of scott's tots there were two older couples in front of me at tiff,0.078514054
that had to leave halfway through because it was stressing them out too much and,0.11479629
one of my friends apple watches was alerting him to a heightened heart rate it's,0.08443071
easily one of the best performances adam sandler has ever given in his life and,0.10068931
it's a damn shame that he got no love from the academy for it it's,0.76867104
a wild ride next up is something that needs no introduction we're talking parasite no,0.4448809
surprises here won the academy award for best picture and it's well deserved this is,0.06253423
an incredibly well made movie by south korean director bong joon ho and it excels,0.27846926
everywhere the story is tight it juggles serious social commentary while standing on its own,0.09102797
as a great film something some other films have struggled with or downright failed at,0.08558167
in recent memory it goes through a multitude of themes from comedy to drama to,0.07200849
thriller with a sprinkle of horror the acting's incredible the shots are incredible the house,0.20723154
is incredible well worth getting over the one inch tall barrier of subtitles and giving,0.15097515
this a watch you should be able to rent this pretty much everywhere as right,0.09923478
now and for my last quirky recommend is under the silver lake which i actually,0.11259511
watched back in 2018 and then it didn't get any kind of push until 2019,0.055527456
and even then they still didn't push it this is an a24 movie the champion,0.07564884
of the independent film that does such a good job marketing its stuff and making,0.034420457
people fall in love with these off the beat films that usually wouldn't have gotten,0.1363573
any recognition otherwise so i have no idea why they failed so much with the,0.07678402
promotion and distribution of this movie because it does have a super dedicated fan base,0.06331916
this movie is basically a wild conspiracy driven film in which the main character sam,0.17507167
played by andrew garfield tries to figure out what happened to a girl that he,0.087312795
met at his apartment complex after she abruptly vanishes overnight it's wild it's got a,0.15263107
bunch of secret codes there's an entire subreddit dedicated to decoding all the different things,0.11635638
in the movie and trying to find secret meaning on things in album covers and,0.06564836
pizza boxes and symbols on walls absolutely love it i believe this is available on,0.08098762
amazon prime for streaming and if you have to rent it i personally think it's,0.123503305
definitely worth it especially if you're looking for something that's just a little bit less,0.2600894
conventional so now we're going to kind of get into the comedy drama related stuff,0.10817658
and we'll start off with one that i know is just added to hulu in,0.08390928
the united states big time adolescent starring griffin gluck and pete davidson again this was,0.2744819
one of my favorites from last year's sundance this is a coming-of-age story where a,0.06005709
teenager is looking up to an older guy as a personal hero and that older,0.102391146
guy loves having the teenager around because it makes him feel cool pete's character obviously,0.123396724
isn't the best role model and ultimately starts to corrupt griffin's character so really i,0.18457212
think this is a really solid hilarious yet at times very depressing coming of age,0.2523693
story y'all know i love my coming-of-age stories but if you have hulu no reason,0.112935394
not to pop this on but i would recommend the rent if it's available for,0.059923213
rent onto another coming of age no surprise we got book smart on the list,0.24857189
if you haven't managed to catch book smart yet i highly recommend it i love,0.18908441
the fact that this movie has nothing to do with friendships being ruined because a,0.14031298
guy gets in the way it has nothing to do with petty jealousy or competition,0.25364903
which is so refreshing obviously there's conflict but it's more to do with differences in,0.05940518
personal growth and becoming their own people it also does a really great job showing,0.11020324
that just because you think you're better than other people doesn't mean they're not going,0.109580554
to be successful the nerdy kids can be jerks too and the people that were,0.78928626
mean to you aren't all destined for failure the person who bullied me the most,0.32420406
is the heiress to an entire shipping corporation her life's gonna be fine this is,0.07791355
available on amazon prime another one that i have a full video for knives out,0.19508785
i love this movie we got good ol whodunit wrapped in a thriller it's such,0.31089434
a fun watch incredible performances from everyone involved i think it looks beautiful as a,0.09478935
movie and there are so many little easter eggs throughout the house and throughout the,0.08974542
film in general that you'll catch on repeat viewings very very fun watch next up,0.0774877
is jojo rabbit which is another academy award nominee and screenplay winner again get a,0.01980487
full video about this on my channel but it's essentially a satire taking a look,0.18397474
at how easy it is to indoctrinate people in hateful ideologies and how pertinent that,0.24377346
still is today and how easy it can be to change those views when people,0.09635452
are given the chance to confront the things they think they hate not many people,0.15004714
seem to dislike this movie so it's definitely a recommend for me another big nominee,0.24016623
at the academy awards we got once upon a time in hollywood tarantino's love letter,0.05623849
to hollywood as well as what might have been a meta look at his own,0.10673729
career and legacy movie follows washed up actor rick dalton as he stares down the,0.13611585
barrel of his own obsolescence at the turn of the decade this is another one,0.09816767
of tarantino's flipped history movies changing the events from the manson murders but unlike the,0.07895161
hunting of sharon tate this doesn't just turn into a weird exploitation horror on a,0.149261
real tragedy and ultimately lends to a greater commentary on tarantino's own critics who constantly,0.118425325
come at him for the violence in his films the slower burn for most of,0.40758204
the movie but my god does he make up for that in his final act,0.118586786
now my favorite video on my channel remains to this day to be my shia,0.12394964
labeouf video and in that video i talk about peanut butter falcon so if you,0.1850175
haven't seen that video you should go watch it because i love it and it's,0.10812966
my it's my baby i love that video so much but peanut butter falcon specifically,0.20149517
is this amazing journey of a movie it's so heartwarming i went out of my,0.121157944
way to watch it in la and i'm from canada dakota johnson stands i know,0.13274585
you're out there watch this movie it's it's just great it's just so nice keeping,0.09611941
on that train we're gonna go into honeyboy which you guys should also know was,0.07886206
basically my movie of 2019. i've got i just got my alma jorel shirt she,0.14889163
directed it i've got like two different honeyboy shirts i fell in love with that,0.09574525
movie at last year's sundance made sure to prioritize it at tiff last year to,0.05017162
watch it a second time and i'm patiently waiting for the day that i can,0.070113294
buy a physical copy of this movie this is largely an autobiography on shai's life,0.08924569
as a child star while dealing with the abuse from his attic alcoholic father and,0.3599639
learning to let go of years of the pent-up pain that led to his own,0.31089434
breakdowns in life this is a beautiful movie i love it if you were in,0.30382717
the u.s this is available on amazon prime and i urge you to watch it,0.06267027
also watch my shia video i worked really hard on it another of my tops,0.25112388
from last year's sundance the farewell this is an excellent film by director lulu wong,0.046906117
starring aquafina whose family moved from china to america when she was about six years,0.10474815
old it's revealed that her grandmother is dying of cancer and rather than telling her,0.36425474
the family is staging a fake wedding in china to get everyone together one last,0.24091983
time in china this is seen as an act of kindness so the person doesn't,0.062535934
spend their last days worrying this is obviously difficult for billy who feels the pull,0.06811785
from each culture it's a beautiful movie and for something with such seemingly depressing subject,0.18166384
matter it's actually very funny i know this is available on prime in canada so,0.082190335
it's probably available on amazon prime in the us definitely worth your time now i,0.044467025
mentioned this in my oscar discussion video but i relate to nothing in marriage story,0.07613162
but my god what an excellent film that made me feel so much for an,0.06909996
area of the world that i just have nothing in common with it's such a,0.1497382
well-made well-scripted well-directed and well-acted movie about a family struggle during divorce adam driver and,0.042552553
scarlett both did such an amazing job here i've said it before but i wish,0.071970224
this movie had come out in 2020 because with the steep 2019 competition it just,0.062719196
struggled to pick up awards that it could have easily won any other year obviously,0.03981986
this was funded by netflix so it is available on netflix and should be available,0.056929123
on netflix worldwide then some newer ones that should be rolling out into rental little,0.13074726
women in which greta gerwig actually managed to make amy likeable character and allowed each,0.24040021
of the sisters motivations to shine as valuable which is kind of amazing considering how,0.07763538
many times this has been attempted i love the way they implemented a non-linear storytelling,0.11046111
and i really love that it infused some of what louisa may alcott might have,0.09289247
been truly trying to express but wasn't able to because of the time that she,0.13872005
was living in 1917 i know just came out this week and while i realized,0.0620523
it's definitely something better suited to a theater experience i do think it's worth the,0.09154672
watch at home it's a pretty simple story pretty simple script but the enjoyment comes,0.06647642
from the fluidity of the whole movie being designed to feel like one take i,0.07632743
think they do a really good job doing that amazing cinematography as expected the gentleman,0.11640445
i know it's a 2020 movie and i know that people are like it's like,0.111994356
if someone was pretending to be guy richie but it's actually guy ritchie but i,0.3398097
loved this movie i had such a good time watching it and then a few,0.101501875
other ones would be last black man in san francisco happy death day to you,0.76887125
the report loose waves ready or not and the velocipaster there are so many amazing,0.0884478
movies that came out in 2019 these are some of the ones i recommended that,0.08519929
i figured people might not have saw or i just felt like i wanted to,0.09660606
talk about it again so thank you so much for watching have a fantastic day,0.067707494
stay safe out there wash your hands maintain your six feet of space don't go,0.15140682
out if you don't have to have a fantastic day and we'll catch you all,0.16278344
