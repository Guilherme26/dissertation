a Steve I can't remember a way it's no ruin all feminists Keira eyelid I,0.49513006
think we've seen this in the trailer she finds him resuscitates him but he resuscitates,0.16384208
himself basically the amazons find out from him that there is a war going on,0.17986895
and now Diana wants to help stop the war she believes that Ares is the,0.15011281
cause of this war if she's heard of a special weapon on them as scare,0.37436485
and she wants to take this women weapon and she wants to slay Ares to,0.7093121
stop this war and to stop all these millions of people from dying around the,0.400116
planet and then we have our story I would like to say that as far,0.07630367
as this movie goes I thought that all the actors were good I thought that,0.10977188
all the actors were good I did I didn't have a problem the acting whatsoever,0.12810265
and I thought a gal gadot did a great job as being one whine the,0.25337458
banter between her and Trevor Steve found the lie and keep mixing up the names,0.2498773
but I think it's Trevor could be Steve I think is Trevor for all you,0.027705941
psychos out there they're like oh the name of the guy wrong you okay so,0.44215202
what oh so I thought of acting was fine I thought Gallagher and I did,0.1287199
a great job the banter between them too was good during the movie there was,0.09626401
a lot of I'm not of your world what is this type of jokes what,0.24852316
does that mean type of jokes you know for stepping my bounds as a woman,0.29912382
the only things that'll want to doesn't do in your world a lot of those,0.18059757
jokes in there visually it looked very similar to a Zack Snyder movies to color,0.15873373
grading and the grit and just the way everything looked looked like something similar to,0.05533422
his Boonton his you know movies okay I know it wasn't directed by him but,0.24162199
you could see that they were made trying to make everything seamless in between these,0.09514797
movies that are in the Snyder verse they all have a particular look his look,0.06749609
and I could see that I would say that the movie was slow-moving the first,0.09633035
half but not boring that makes sense you slow but not boring ah the action,0.113635994
was good when it was getting good one thing in particular I had a homosexual,0.5600247
couple that was sitting to my left right next to me and they one of,0.0708418
them in particular made it very hard need to concentrate on particular action sequences because,0.067350544
when the action sequences got on particularly the first major action sequence it's in the,0.049795352
trailer which breaks the gun and all that stuff this dude was killing me I'm,0.6894528
kidding you're trying it really goodness he's okay kept doing it was just driving me,0.11259915
nuts but wet so anyway um our action sequences were good um movie was longer,0.42184338
than I thought was going to be certain people died I anything with us docking,0.3523614
and uh I would say that she was wonder what throughout the movie she was,0.116832
she was funny she was sexy she was strong she was powerful she was fast,0.53490317
she was basically everything that I wanted her to be so I can say that,0.13285106
I'm very happy with the Wonder Woman character pretty much in how they portrayed her,0.09736684
the movie has comedic moments a little campy sometimes but it had its moments had,0.094757035
action pretty much a lot of what I was looking for you know there's like,0.070361875
an X Factor did they tell you make someone great what is it X Factor,0.086285554
here down that is keeping me from absolutely loving this movie I'm not sure exactly,0.09767055
what it was I don't know if it was the pacing or I told you,0.10867997
it was slow but not boring like I don't love it but I don't hate,0.11753237
the movie either I'm ok with it that's how I feel you know I'm going,0.071411155
to give it three out of five wolves and uh this is going to be,0.14201151
mullet style so let's start talking mullet which means spoilers ok review in the front,0.10877364
spoiler zooming back that's my mother's style I ain't expectin the dude to die I,0.54666567
expect that but then again it was all those years ago she's a god so,0.102137946
okay well that rep set up next to me known as Han um Ares was,0.083287686
Magneto don't tell me he wasn't he was magneto magneto okay a funny-looking type of,0.17281061
magneto because he said you know Scotland Yard bushy mustache like it's like he totally,0.44620618
threw me off and way this was the God of War the Lord the God,0.31089434
of War looks like um she did fly a little bit her Nerys did their,0.52947295
little levitation thing I think if we saw her levitate like twice especially when she,0.24990839
rained down and you know took his power and send it back to him she,0.31089434
was she was in there floating levitating that flight as far as I'm concerned and,0.18774363
at the end she was flying I'm sorry that was flight that wasn't a Hulka,0.08922926
jump anywhere she's flying wherever she wanted to go uh y'all can argue with me,0.26067215
all you want I don't give a you know I'd oh so I guess the,0.18035024
true test will be when Justice League comes along we see her fly in Justice,0.06556233
League then we noticed she's able to fly we know that's how she dropped in,0.10466678
front of Batman that's how she dropped it from him she flew there I don't,0.08541242
care she flies on planes when she's doing business she used her superpowers to get,0.17282341
over there and she flew okay oh I did like just I did like that,0.08053014
first scene I like that first scene where she got into the war the first,0.25356227
part was a little extra theatrical I mean when she stepped up the ladder zpn,0.08870852
and pin and the gay dude messed it up for me again about oh well,0.8301801
you just can't do hopefully man you are killing this for me so I guess,0.5097093
he's a diva watching addy but so he was happy so um I'm watching this,0.19030996
and you know she's gonna do peeling Peru now was it - personally I just,0.07705411
normally was over the top for me over-the-top theatrics you know whatever you may think,0.08435252
of what I like I don't care because it's like there's certain things that work,0.10188469
for me and certain things I don't some of you will hear me give a,0.14214821
review on something they label you didn't like this but you like this that has,0.10581282
nothing to do with this he's even I'm saying so I'm talking about Wonder Woman,0.23960929
right now and certain things in their context and how they were done in other,0.032998875
movies we ain't talking about that with this movie and yeah I know some of,0.08063297
y'all do that with certain things and you know you don't get it you know,0.09333269
think properly you just relate one thing the other a little superhero sir if you,0.0826142
like this that means you have to like this that's not well how how life,0.21944116
works that's not how my minds work anyway so once she started getting on the,0.08504716
field and she had the shield and everything that was a cool sequence you know,0.091812775
in Trevor or Steve Trevor got on there with his mentor took out the Germans,0.094063625
and then when she got in there and she started all them soldiers up that,0.08325325
was very very reminiscent of the warehouse scene with Batman very I live really did,0.08563192
that was that was her that was her Batman warehouse scene lonely you know ones,0.1805656
and um as far as the crowd I'm going to talk about the crowd I,0.07395214
would like to say other than the gay dudes next to me go low whoo,0.8377732
I didn't hear anything throughout the movie I didn't hear any cheers I personally didn't,0.033987623
cheer myself until be it I think everyone was happy with the product and with,0.050373208
the movie and you know they were like damn at least you made it you,0.69542736
know yeah I think everybody you know yeah but I gotta say when I'm thinking,0.13687181
of the movies where you know I'm thinking of the vvvv DC universe movies that,0.041996494
I've seen start from Man of Steel I don't remember hearing any cheering in Man,0.060590267
of Steel until the end also although I was chairing doornail I thought I was,0.04977572
doing my crazy maniacal laughter whoo certain things I was watching I was grinning ear-to-ear,0.48560107
watching a lot of that and then um that may be Superman I remember three,0.08237882
times specifically people cheering during the whole Batman V Superman fight the the Batman warehouse,0.11956365
fight and when when Wonder Woman showed the up and at the end and at,0.17444983
the end sorry so four times I remember the crowd cheering during that movie okay,0.071920834
Wonder Woman it wasn't till the end and Suicide Squad none there's no cheering at,0.32530397
all I ain't hear any cheers at all so I'm now it depends on where,0.058254186
you go you know certain places you go people and give a you know and,0.18814161
all that so you know I understand in my area I'm telling you my movie,0.11709114
going experience okay if I had to rate all the movies together I'm going to,0.105614915
go with all the the the the DC Cinematic Universe movies not counting Green Lantern,0.10836248
of course I'm going to go with Batman V Superman first for me um then,0.07233691
man is steel and then Wonder Woman and then Suicide Squad so those all the,0.3564833
three of those are my top three I enjoyed watching all three uh but um,0.07092025
you know it's you know the I told you I just did not like Suicide,0.31089434
Squad at all Wonder Woman it gets a pass for me if I really great,0.14752172
it would be a see you know it's just something about it it wasn't great,0.16019732
to me but I thought it was still a good job but I'm not I'm,0.071817495
not exactly calling it average maybe I will call it a C+ you know what,0.20415157
I mean I'm not I liked a lot of it but some of it I,0.0772237
sat like this fool out of the movie I did they were just certain disconnects,0.7798283
that didn't exactly work from me but I was still pleased with the product I,0.051837556
was still pleased with it but I wasn't overly happy like I was you know,0.102742165
um you know with like a remaining steel and then when especially Batman V Superman,0.091817774
I was very pleased very pleased but uh I don't know I just I think,0.18314749
they did a good job making our Wonder Woman for today and I'm happy and,0.1456267
I can't wait to see her and the Justice League and mr. Snyder please put,0.098812886
the rest whether she can fly it not okay I don't care what who said,0.1421411
in an interview or not okay because we know they did movie makers and actors,0.075354576
be with us in interviews and then eventually stuff Adams in the movies in like,0.06248082
wait a minute I thought you said so um she was lying on to me,0.42259592
levitation is flight okay far as I'm concerned levitation is flight okay like you floating,0.23000307
for alright and at the end it was no slow motion jump that was a,0.08484752
