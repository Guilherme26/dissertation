hey everybody today I'm reviewing spotlight which is directed by thomas mccarthy this is his,0.11846965
fifth film i believe this film has an incredibly talented cast that has enough sophistication,0.10871639
to be able to act in a very understated manner nobody here is really being,0.120961905
showy with their acting which to me really matches the very minimalistic and understated style,0.16563846
of the film you have Michael Keaton Mark Ruffalo Rachel McAdams Liev Schreiber stanley tucci,0.21144247
and the list goes on and this film is based on true events that happened,0.052695297
in Boston in the early 2000s 2001 actually and basically it's about the investigative journalism,0.05880406
unit in the Boston Globe and they come across a story about allegations made against,0.034956943
the Catholic Church and a few priests in the area were accused of molesting 80,0.26463997
or more boys throughout the years and of course nowadays it's more common knowledge but,0.056594126
at the time it was considered quite shocking it was scandalous especially because Americans didn't,0.09773888
know how to deal with this kind of information because you know the church is,0.0987561
deeply embedded in the ideologies of American culture and it's hugely fundamental in terms of,0.096407995
how the country was built in the first place just like many of the corporations,0.10151405
that have been built over the decades over the centuries religion and and the church,0.14916098
has become a dominant conglomerate in its own right that's the dilemma of the film,0.09303761
and it's not only just an overall dilemma but it's also a lot of internal,0.070947535
conflict with the actual characters the main characters themselves because many of them were raised,0.13651468
Catholic as children it's about lifting that veil so to speak on this puritanical society,0.24080074
whatever that means and something that people thought that they knew and that they trusted,0.15398514
and revealing this dark underbelly of society that you know so many terrible things are,0.31089434
happening that people do not acknowledge I loved this movie I thought it was a,0.19573826
wonderful piece of filmmaking it works on so many different levels it works as a,0.104284704
great investigative piece it works as a social commentary and it's also a very grippy,0.066129364
suspenseful piece of filmmaking and it never over does a single aspect of what it's,0.24025647
trying to convey this film is extremely reminiscent of a lot of those very minimalistic,0.16986345
raw 1970s films like All the President's Men that's the easiest comparison i can make,0.21698648
because they both are very very similar and then of course i felt like as,0.09074363
i was watching this movie I was watching this great Sidney Lumet films like Dog,0.24964255
Day Afternoon Serpico spotlight works right along with those films almost perfectly because there's almost,0.17886373
no fat to trim here I mean they get right down to it it's very,0.15465494
direct there's nothing at all that is superfluous and it's not a glamorous Hollywood movie,0.08633341
in the slightest everything feels very very real the office settings are very bland and,0.17518213
ordinary and the wardrobes of the characters feel just very mundane and they don't draw,0.0696251
attention to themselves not in a boring way but they're just trying to capture the,0.10556234
details every little thing that makes you feel like you are living in this world,0.18701266
every single tints in immediate moment that these journalists are feeling you feel like you're,0.15055935
right along with them in this movie really celebrates professionalism and it celebrates what investigative,0.09897178
journalism can be so you don't see much about what's going on in the characters,0.13168125
lives other than what's in their professional lives but the film always just gives very,0.081289545
subtle hints of what's going on in these characters personal lives so that you are,0.13664345
able to build enough sympathy as a viewer and they are never overt about it,0.14944506
it's always just kind of a little thing here or there you know in a,0.05907467
lesser film probably a lot of the characters would have you know pause the rest,0.13138126
of the film and gone into this very wordy anecdote and that just would have,0.07756924
really detracted I think as these characters are discovering all of these really troubling facts,0.0801531
about all these priests and as the facts start to build and build and they,0.16970743
find more and more information you just get sucked into it right along with them,0.8038494
one thing that really makes the movie work is that it really does pay attention,0.053981714
to the time period it takes that time period of 2001 and makes it a,0.056904696
major focal point which is something that raises the stakes 2001 was a major turning,0.050784416
point not just for Americans but for the entire world I mean it was the,0.11930789
start of a new millennium and of course 911 happens right in the middle of,0.09730926
when these journalists are trying to gather all this information on the church and priorities,0.10888532
start to shift very in a very different direction and the world becomes a lot,0.13336019
darker and a lot more cynical as a result also we start to see the,0.31698525
internet becoming a lot more prominent a lot more relevant as the 2000 start to,0.06258957
progress so the old world of the newspaper and journalism is starting to die out,0.43768004
and these characters at the Boston Globe they're not only trying to expose a very,0.05338902
dark scandal but they're also trying to save themselves and try to gather those readers,0.12256686
that they might be losing so that they can continue doing important journalism a lot,0.1136054
of the characters you can see as they're trying to find out more information on,0.054230373
this story they are constantly going through you know physical archives books and and pages,0.07980352
and pages of information and there's very little digital work going on in terms of,0.034625977
the internet and not only does that show you how much times have changed since,0.09706443
then but I think that's very deliberate on the part of the director because you're,0.12416071
seeing all of these characters teetering right on the edge of the old world and,0.1167987
this breakthrough into the digital world and now we live in a time where nothing,0.102379486
is secretive almost anything you can find just by the click of a button it's,0.10293072
easier to find stories and to discuss them and to expose the system for what,0.03503479
it truly is these journalists are right on the cusp of that and it's almost,0.09536829
as if they're introducing symbolically the world in in the story at least to a,0.05988364
different world we're digging for stories and having to go do all this underground work,0.06254961
is going to start becoming far more mainstream that's just one reason why I think,0.07684981
that they'll have so many great ideas going on and they're pulled off in the,0.10065722
most effort list of ways and the drama comes from underneath which is very rare,0.07850762
in a Hollywood film there are a few things here and there that I would,0.075652085
change just to give the film more polish more sophistication one big thing for me,0.07069069
was the score by Howard sure I just I felt like it came off as,0.093552195
very kind of cookie cutter detective music I thought that the film deserved a lot,0.1766292
more I wish they were able to get somebody like David Shire you should look,0.11964373
up his music for another 1970s film that this film reminds me of the conversation,0.07890389
he did that score and he also did zodiac that would have been the perfect,0.07497336
way to enhance it for me but I mean I'm nitpicking what's more important is,0.06574908
the power that this film has just a story and as something that is a,0.0656431
social commentary it's very relevant and it needs to be told and you should absolutely,0.06792632
see it it is very entertaining it is well made it's it's a really really,0.08036753
great film i'm so glad that i saw it so that is my review thank,0.082846776
