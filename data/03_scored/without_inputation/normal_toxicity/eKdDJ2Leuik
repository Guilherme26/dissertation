it's time to talk about a movie here,0.09340983
and for this installment,0.1050573
it's The Godfather,0.058644168
I was really really excited to see this one,0.086308874

now on with the review the godfather was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and came out in 1972 as it stars Marlon Brando Al Pacino Robert Duvall James Caan Diane Keaton as it headlines a star-studded cast for what is an incredible movie there's a reason why this is a classic,0.12975515
and I think we're gonna get into it,0.08472664
but it is just so well done and Francis Ford Coppola Bravo to you sir,0.108975604
because this movie is a hit and I can totally understand why now the film follows the Corleone family was part of the Italian mafia in the 1940s in New York and the power struggle that goes on with the other families in the Mafia during this time period is very prevalent and a big part of this film,0.17811966
but also the characters that really stand out in the family specifically have to be Vito played by Marlon Brando,0.07439504
and Michael played by Al Pacino their characters are integral to the main plot of the story as they're highly involved together but it's interesting because since Michael was involved in world war two he comes back and is not really a part of the family business and was kind of not dealt in on things,0.050730772
but since he is Beto's favorite son Vienna really wants him to have the business and really run things,0.13588881
but Michael really isn't into it at the start really important quote that Michael says in the beginning of the film it's during the wedding scene,0.061684232
he's talking to Kay,0.11585207
in case asking him are you a part of this,0.15331973
do you know what's going on,0.055137053
and he says that's my family kay,0.058001596
it's not me,0.1028195
this is the important one,0.06489225
this is the one that shows,0.087908626
that's where Michael is in the beginning and then his transformation to the end of the film is really the most intriguing part,0.058263306
I saw a movie a couple weeks ago Goodfellas which was a great movie the mob boss is the guy that you should be feared,0.28002617
he should really respect him,0.08554115
and you know he's the guy who gets stuff done and that I just felt like he was doing his thing he's grilling sausages and just kind of they're in this one Brando really has that figure and that aura about him that just commands respect and commands attention because every time he has a scene you pay attention and you know better because if you don't then you're in trouble,0.11987713
I think it's interesting to kind of show that even though he has so much power and even though he's done so much,0.086535245
he's kind of off his game,0.18174036
he's kind of at the tail end at his career and that's a turning point for a lot of families that are in the Mafia at that time and they kind of want him gone so they try and do anything that they can to take him out and try and supersede his power the Corleone family,0.15217806
they're not gonna let that happen,0.15619391
they're gonna try and do the best they can to preserve that power and Sonny the oldest son played by James Caan it was most notably also in ELF playing Will Ferrell's dad does everything he can to try,0.07904644
and preserve the family business,0.06556831
he's kind of like a wild card,0.26341426
maverick sort of type deal he'll kind of do what he wants and on impulse,0.19583812
but he kind of won't think things through,0.10086925
and that's I think where Vito saw,0.054355968
Michael was a little more rational and can kind of do things by thinking them through instead of just kind of like,0.08702546
oh this happened,0.0751587
I better retaliate,0.091624774
and I think that's what makes Michael's characters so engaging,0.056270532
and so relatable is that in the beginning he's kind of like oh I'm not involved in this like I shouldn't be he's just enjoying himself with Kay and he's you know living his life,0.1573289
but as soon as certain events happen Michael starts to really change,0.07178521
and I think that that turning point is the scene in the restaurant where he deals with,0.019502552
so the other head of the Italian mafia family,0.49921864
and the chief of police michael has a choice to make and ultimately that choice is what changes his character for the rest of the film this movie is really paced well and for it being almost a three-hour film for that to happen is a pretty extraordinary feat and it's really a tale of two halves,0.07785524
you have the first half where Vito's character is in control,0.04750586
and then the second half after he's attempted on by the selasa family it's Michael's time to shine,0.100402676
and I think that that's really well done in a sense of showing how they're different,0.070165694
but also it's very similar,0.056130648
and I think that's why Beto liked him so much because he was so much like Michael was so much like him,0.14423013
and the ending is just great because it sets up that line that I mentioned earlier in the beginning it shows how Michael has come full circle from kind of going to I'm not involved,0.062306225
That's not me k2,0.09843809
I'm in this this is my life,0.07124408
now I've accepted the family,0.03366223
I've accepted the family business,0.036614858
and Kay asked him to tell him the truth,0.048765182
and he straight-up lies to her and that not only sets up more tension down,0.45678243
the road,0.04209195
but it also builds for another installment which we will get into next time as I want to be a part 2 of The Godfather but overall as a score I'm gonna get the Godfather a four point eight out of five,0.061235037
that's the highest rated score I've given a movie so it's a pretty good accomplishment to the Godfather,0.0638506
thank you all so much for watching,0.050267864
it really means a lot to me the support that I've gotten over the past month and a half since I've started this channel and I'm gonna keep going I'm gonna create more and more content for you guys,0.09457213
and put out fun stuff that I like to do and I hope that you enjoy watching and part two will be coming for the Godfather soon so stay tuned for that and I'll catch,0.107817285
