oh okay,0.066223346
hey hey what did what a couple of dates,0.14929861
right,0.04255815
dodging,0.041331682
spoilers,0.07093216
going completely Internet gone not streaming at all,0.2458521
so don't get any spoilers of anything keeping radio silence I I saw it at midnight I left the theater at 3:30 got home at like 4:00 little earlier than four I'm I had nothing but Raisinets and coffee for the past like 12 hours,0.07522075
I'm my face is red I'm breaking out I'm sweaty,0.29615515
everything is going crazy,0.34232438
I'm trying to catch up on work that I've messed up on and and everything is insane,0.24429807
but we're here to discuss a review for Avengers endgame,0.04876408
I don't do movie reviews at all,0.093474925
so if you're new here,0.06939934
hi I'm Berkey,0.11184815
I don't do these but they're fun sometimes,0.14376682
so I occasionally do them but we are just going here to discuss Avengers endgame because of course we are because of course I gotta get that YouTube money,0.059213776
but of course I want to talk about it,0.064392455
I did a review for infinity war back in the day as well,0.12686548
and so I thought be a very interesting thing to go ahead and talk about this particular movie because it's a big deal,0.08243462
and unfortunately reviewing the movie is hard as hell because the trailer showed maybe the first quarter of the film and they showed you basically nothing and it has it's just not it's nothing,0.18579608
they shown you pretty much nothing,0.40332955
and the trailers are fantastic they do a great job at setting up the movie and setting up what you think you'll be getting into when in reality there is so much more going on and it's pretty fantastic when you actually do see it now what do,0.055876225
I think in the movie it's great it's phenomenal,0.07571217
actually it is incredible,0.043154538
it is in my opinion not as good as infinity war however it has a lot of parts that are better than infinity war,0.28950626
and that's hard to entirely,0.08057582
describe without going into spoilers which I will not be going into today,0.092060566
and it's difficult to really provide a good reason or discussion of why I think part of it is really really good and better than infinity war,0.14810744
but as a movie I would probably consider it just slightly lower like if you had a top-five list of Marvel movies if any war beer they're an endgame would be right below it,0.18254183
but overall it is a pretty phenomenal movie it is long movie three hours long,0.13589105
and there are no good bathroom breaks,0.11756319
so just don't drink water at all ever in that entire day dehydrate yourself,0.18134911
I don't know just there are,0.13025089
no good time solely by the bathroom,0.12967917
the three hours fly by I understand three hours,0.08630423
this is like interstellar length of a movie so it flies by but it is still very long and it split up into three acts like most things are,0.096809
and the first act that I could name each acts in their own ways,0.16441737
the first act is depression and sadness,0.120019704
the second act is comedy and fanservice,0.109950006
and the third act is spectacle,0.09665305
the first act is actually probably my favourite act,0.07170768
it deals a lot with what happens,0.07842737
when Thanos does his snap,0.17721094
what happens when half the population is eradicated and how these Avengers and people are trying to survive afterwards because it hurts it,0.23563792
hurts,0.14460315
pretty bad,0.24015146
and these are all actors that are incredibly good,0.13876851
we kind of forget that the people who play these roles are very talented actors,0.04843885
and actresses Robert Downey jr. Jeremy Renner Paul Rudd skal Johansen etc these are good actors you know I mean they may not always be in good films but they can act,0.16721089
em it's nice to have them,0.098284155
finally acting,0.048720032
finally showing pain and and sadness and depression and it is extremely good in particular there is a lot of Hawkeye and ant-man in this movie and they are actually pretty,0.21131825
damn good Scott Lang and Liz,0.6045239
it was a Clint Barton last name Paul Rudd and Jeremy Renner they do a great job in their respective roles,0.13539349
they have a lot of screen time and especially Hawkeye has a very good amount of time,0.061811566
and he really has a nicely developed character I thoroughly enjoyed him this movie focuses a lot more around the six main Avengers,0.079350576
so that's Iron Man's,0.07172631
Hulk Thor Captain America Black Widow Hawkeye and it does actually do a little bit of ant-man as well like I just mentioned,0.09364363
but those here main main ingredient players personally captain America is my favorite Avenger,0.051655665
and he has been ever since Civil War actually no no no Winter Soldier because he seems like he went through a lot of arcs,0.11772603
the first Captain America movie it was pretty good but it wasn't anything overly fantastic and his character wasn't overly interesting,0.15398611
it was just I am small and weak and now I am big and strong but his morals and his own personal personality didn't really change civil erb when a soldier really kind of put the screws to that Civil War put the screws to it even more,0.23223726
and now I think he's a really well fleshed out character,0.15516503
and he got a decent amount of screen time,0.090348005
he's actually very important in this movie primarily Robert Downey jr. and Chris Evans,0.05697495
so Iron Man Captain America do a pretty phenomenal job in their in their retrospective,0.15430194
areas em days do the show sometimes and it becomes pretty damn fantastic going over to the second act,0.30353725
it's a lot more fanservice see is it too fanservice,0.094085254
see maybe I don't know on a first viewing,0.089129835
I loved the hell out of it it was great both in terms of emotional punches comedic punches and just fanservice in general however I do wonder if I'll get tired of it on subsequent viewings I'll have to see it again in order to legitimately think about that,0.24110927
but the second act is actually my personal opinion,0.073562376
the weakest of the three acts not because it's bad but because of some pacing issues it's a little bit - alright we're doing,0.14132525
this and then we're doing,0.05402367
this and then these people are doing,0.07997819
this these people are doing this then but but they're doing this also and we gotta be careful cuz these guys are doing,0.055533014
this and we gotta cut back because we gotta save on,0.12869576
time and it's still a three-hour long movie you could probably make the entire film or you could make an entire film we're on the second act and happen to be a full-fledged movie I think the pacing was a little bit difficult there but it was still pretty,0.08543108
sob and the third act is just it's it's just,0.11116029
insane it's it's,0.20412272
ridiculous it is an absolute,0.6293827
spectacle,0.008917308
it is fantastic crazy looking and I can't really describe it in any way because anything that I could describe it with will be a spoiler and is just too too crazy,0.40316567
I can't say anything about it,0.07129037
the third act is immense,0.08130495
one of the most impressive third acts of any movie I've ever seen,0.09561034
it is the culmination of 10 years of filmmaking 10 years of Marvel BAM right into the last 45 minutes and it is pretty incredible,0.06793837
it is it's undescribable,0.07844005
I can't really talk about it without you actually going out and seeing it or spoiling it,0.15286618
so I am just saying,0.058476824
it's great,0.06999714
it does have some downsides at least part,0.069754824
I mean throughout the full movie not the 3rd act in primarily but overall the movie is phenomenal,0.08155492
it is a very good final movie it is a great kind of farewell to the first 10 years there's obviously gonna be more Marvel movies but it is a solid end piece and game,0.08909911
haha jokes jokes I'm just so funny but sorry sorry yeah it's a great 10 it's a great 10-year send-off and overall some pacing issues,0.08879561
I have also you can nitpick the out of this movie it's just a warning,0.18313119
if you're like kind of people that really care about specifics and and certain continuity and wait if they did this in this movie how are they doing this in endgame and how why don't they just do this and that you can you'll do that and if you're that kind of person you will do that a lot,0.117947794
there are a lot of issues like that I can name a loft out of my head,0.24020377
and if that's the kind of thing that really bugs you like this does this,0.26385537
and I hate this because this was supposed to be this in that movie then okay valid criticisms valid criticisms and I completely see that but expectations are important in a movie and I'll say this like I said before in games,0.17422946
I don't play Uncharted and I don't expect Uncharted to be God of War,0.27205464
and I don't play papers,0.06804857
please and expect it to be Metal Gear Rising,0.09795135
you need to know what you're getting into you're getting into a big spectacle comic book movie yeah there are coincidences,0.24016097
yeah there are easy things that work with the plot and yeah there are plot points that are there just to do this thing of course there are it's a Marvel movie this is what you're getting,0.1233231
you can nitpick the out of this movie,0.14250708
but the movie almost kind of knows this it almost knows that you can nitpick it and so it just doesn't care and at the end of the day I'm kind of okay with that because knowing what the movie is is more important than trying to fix all of it kind of like gari is the galaxy right it's dumb and it's fun,0.49600488
and it's silly and it knows it is,0.4934347
and because of that is a better movie because of at the end,0.087581456
so that's my review phenomenal not the best Marvel movie ever but absolutely great a fantastic send-off some really great emotional beats big fan absolutely go see if you haven't been spoiled yet or you haven't seen already tomorrow have any spoiler review as well if you want to talk more about the nitty gritty go ahead and check that up up here,0.11452005
and my name is Ben brick you're all beautiful people,0.12942348
and I will see you later as I get some goddamn water in my system bye bye,0.65941864
