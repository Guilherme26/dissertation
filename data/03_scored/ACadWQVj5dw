that have won awards all across from TIFF to Venice to all around and there,0.063113555
was one film that was probably one of the first films that I saw @mf,0.17851128
of 2019 I really want to talk to you guys about I'm talking about the,0.08301006
portrait of the lady on fire this film it was actually directed by Celine Saima,0.19238274
I apologize for pronunciation of the different names Claire muffin was the cinematographer and the,0.05477994
cast range from I make sure I get all the cast and get all this,0.06863457
out of the way Noemi Marlin play the role of Maryann Adele had no play,0.087611236
the role of hey Louise and they are the two stars of this film now,0.056622107
this is the synopsis of the story on an isolated island on Bettany at the,0.072740465
end of the 18th century a female painter is obligated to paint a wedding portrait,0.12067466
of a young woman simple premise right but I was looking and I was like,0.11776865
I see so many amazing different scores and reviews cinema scores I think right now,0.04189937
currently out of 93 rating so I was like what is it about this story,0.06736129
what is it about this film that has elevated people's response like this and I,0.086321704
will tell you this is one of the best films I've seen all year this,0.07453085
probably is one of the best foreign films I've seen in the past three years,0.060304664
to be quite honest with you now break it down and tell you why so,0.17171577
breaking out from the cinematography what they were able to do with a lot of,0.07445038
the shots we're just mind melting because it opens up on the the ocean you,0.2420967
have Mary and is going to the island and kind of going with her painting,0.046437398
materials and try to do everything she need to do and the first thing that,0.06573099
happens she has to go over for some unseen reason but the camera never leaves,0.13086185
the atmosphere what I mean by that is mary-louise again is an artist and they,0.085563384
take so much careful detail to the way she paints the way she draws the,0.07095635
way that the characters interact they are very personal istic there's an amazing moment by,0.06206482
a campfire that there's this Harmonist ik like noise is happening where people are singing,0.22546422
people are dancing but the way that this actually shot is just so it pulls,0.24259105
you in on so many different levels but at the same time there's an elegance,0.122484945
behind it because a big part of this film is the love story is the,0.0734447
the essence of art and the beauty behind like painting and drawing and just the,0.047562268
art form in general and it goes from different ranges of that it can go,0.039756987
from at a certain point there was a moment where hey Louise and Mary Andy,0.025210055
are going at a piano and Mary Louise starts to play this interesting tune and,0.054882742
like you're just immersed into that now one of the biggest key points about this,0.19911456
is the sound the score there is technically no rhythmic score throughout the film it's,0.06538602
very silent film but their attention to detail whether it's the waves whether it is,0.041945335
the the paint Brussels hitting against the canvas whether it is like the interaction like,0.09947199
the human touch whether it's like this unseemly moment where it feels very uncomfortable and,0.12071662
like you hear like the scratching of like a chair or like something going on,0.14047109
in the background or like at a campfire you hear the popping of the the,0.068465136
wood or the materials or the the leaves this crackling the sound design is perfect,0.07739876
because it lays the atmosphere for everything that's actually happening what other film kind of,0.07067013
did something similar to that which was a lighthouse where their atmosphere was one of,0.062126733
the biggest catalyst for the film but there's there's technically not a real big score,0.066588804
throughout this it's just the sound design is just perfect now let's go to the,0.042268593
platform of the actual actresses and the people that were played in it fit with,0.07742909
this so within this of course you have Adele Hansel know me Marlin with the,0.073168606
main two leads but you also have apologize for I'm not even gonna try to,0.06897382
name her her last name but Luna plays a role of Sophie and Valeria garli,0.072190054
no plays a role of like Humpty's who is hey Louise's mother and really that's,0.16682044
it there is no other cast there's really not any male characters that are primary,0.1333348
leaves or secondary leads the only time you actually see male figures in this film,0.16073276
are they're going and carrying luggage or their the background or people are talking about,0.05742342
what their connection is with this now again this is a very this is a,0.046951346
French film English subtitles but there was never a moment that I have missed the,0.06529111
step there was never a moment I felt like I had to pause because that,0.06653563
was going to class it's very paced very well matter of fact I would say,0.13561982
its pace perfectly because the the tension builds with the relationships that are had because,0.056727923
when Mary Louise when not Mary Louise when Mary Ann gets there like she's kind,0.15334918
of like put in the situation where like okay nobody's helping me to get here,0.18448919
I need to get where I need to go but she's very independent she's very,0.09087892
you know passionate and the actress that plays the role of Mary Ann is so,0.053279955
perfect because she comes across very crass and yet passionate and very artsy but yet,0.122433245
standoffish but then she like consistently kind of drinks wine consistently you know smokes her,0.24010731
pipe and so you know she's kind of like trying to think trying to process,0.09926491
trying to get into her own headspace but keeping people to a distance where the,0.11316931
other side of that the parallel to that is hey Louise who really just doesn't,0.080523014
want her face to be painted I'm not gonna say the reasons why but she,0.30050635
doesn't want to be painted she kind of like wants to be on her own,0.08736777
and she's had tragedies before her life that's platformed her to the way in the,0.18909034
direction she goes now then they are connected together and these actresses are so amazing,0.07428474
because the thing about it is yes they can act there's in their scenes and,0.077285044
the moments just by themselves they can act very well but when they are together,0.0647294
like it is some of the most amazing imagery of art and compassion and empathy,0.11385594
and stress and worry and concern and empathy that are stretched through all different levels,0.09790025
in the short amount of time in the gap of this film and I was,0.07438306
like there's so many different raw emotions that are so efficiently done that I was,0.13109702
I was captivated I'm gonna be very honest I was very much so captivated and,0.09078074
then they interact with the younger person who Sophie who kind of like you know,0.08959158
taking care of the place and kind of not undertake it but she has her,0.24003398
own store she has her own atmosphere that's going on but there's never a moment,0.09101674
where you feel like all this so dreary and so drought that's one of the,0.11311547
things about favor up that towards the the third half of the film I was,0.08808357
kind of mean isn't the present man is is rough there are moments of levity,0.16309097
not just comedy but just like natural progression of characters like they come to really,0.05505364
come into their own come into who they're meant to be who they are to,0.22951439
each other and this all different ranges of emotions that are effortlessly effortless effort Leslie,0.036748786
done and displays through the screenplay because the screenplay I think plays the most part,0.05063083
of it I'm not sure how much of this was improv but it felt like,0.07399009
the script was just tight and I mean I have to give credit where credit's,0.035308965
due when it comes to the directing for this one because the movie knew exactly,0.051111683
what it needed to be it didn't try to reach it didn't try to go,0.054842394
super natural we didn't try to go too artsy it was the perfect blend of,0.06213624
every one of those different dimensions of genre and again Celine Saima I give her,0.11497872
a lot of credit because this right here to me should be and would be,0.071661584
in my personal opinion up for Best Picture nomination not just best foreign film I've,0.06530324
not seen parasite I've heard great accolades about that I've also not seen what was,0.18765822
the other film was a farewell I haven't seen that but this film right here,0.039254013
to me could be a contender for best picked and for me I give this,0.09845673
nothing less than a ten out of ten I know I didn't go too much,0.14300583
into the story I think that the the mood and the movie in himself it,0.078113675
immerses you enough that you are gonna make this story in and out what you,0.09458354
feel it's gonna be and what you feel behind it and by the end of,0.14075604
it you know I was in tears I was laughing I was taking it back,0.11060765
with every single moment and I think that the the the cast were amazing the,0.05620881
sound design was excellent the cinematography was immaculately beautiful and the essence behind art form,0.06496214
mix with camaraderie friendship love is the spread throughout this entire film and they just,0.06924141
glistens perfectly it is the perfect painting I think that's the best way of kind,0.10649564
of complementing this film hopefully you guys enjoyed this review make sure you go and,0.1524977
