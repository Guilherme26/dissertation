how everyone today,0.04405367
I'll be reviewing it happens one night,0.0949472
so it happened one night was directed by Frank Capra and stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and assume come out in 1934 which was only a few years into the sound era,0.08834587
but before the Hays Code era which enforced lots of censorship on films at the start of this film we see call that Colver,0.09054049
she plays a rich woman and she's on this boat with her father and her father she's trying to convince her not to marry this man say cold call that Kolbert she wants to marry this man,0.2422043
but her father basically doesn't agree with it really,0.0981594
so cool at hobart she escapes in the boat and she basically tries to escape and go across to New York City to find the man that she wants to marry,0.08410149
so then we see Clark april's character come in,0.038428687
so Clark Gable,0.052030105
he plays a man who works for a newspaper,0.1179932
he's always looking for a good story and he comes across call that colder,0.083585456
and he then she realizes that she is on the blunt from her family in order to marry this man that she wants to marry,0.25177252
so Clark they have always thinking okay I've got a great story here maybe I can make something of this,0.054435484
so this film really does so well is blend comedy with a romance well a rom-com really obviously,0.0850151
and this is one of the best well as opposed to one of the best classic long comes from the era,0.09347828
now I myself I'm not necessarily a big fan of romantic comedies especially for this sort of era but I think this is very good this film it's it's actually surprisingly funny I found myself chuckling a few times I thought it was very funny and lots of bits,0.15077817
I really like Clark Gable in this film I've only seen Clark Gable in one other film gone with the winds and he was very good in that but he's a lot funny in this film he has lots of witty lines a lot the things he says seem very well timed and it's just very funny,0.05261234
and I really like a chemistry between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert every scene they're in together is going to see quite a lot the film they work off each other really well and the two characters they're always trying to one-up each other in each scene so as I seen a star where Clark Gable was trying to get a seat on my bus,0.061419513
but all that Colbert takes a seat first,0.08522781
and then the bus driver says it's first-come first-serve and then later on there's a scene where Claudette Colbert misses her bus so then quite cables just sat there smiling and it's all these sorts of things which work really,0.07195745
well in making us like these characters,0.09606405
and both these actors in these roles they're both such likeable characters,0.15430883
it's impossible not to like these two and it just makes for a very light-hearted film though are a few darker little bits here and there it's not happy all the way through,0.1346935
but obviously the overall tone of the film is very happy and very enjoyable,0.08039403
now this film did very well at the Oscars,0.06295585
actually won the five big main Oscars which are Best Picture Best Director for Frank Capra Best Actor for Clark Gable Best Actress for pulled at holder and Best Adapted Screenplay now there's only two other films or one those all those five big main Oscars and that is one flow the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975,0.060335554
and then the silence around in 1991,0.11518795
one of my favorite scenes in this film is when Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert on a coach together and then everybody on the coach is singing along to the spans that is playing at the back of the bus and is playing,0.060626436
this song called the man with the flying trapeze and everyone on the bus kind of joins in with the singing,0.20511015
and they all sing different parts of the verses,0.06462748
and it's just a very enjoyable scenes,0.10407554
it's a very like all scenery set on the film really well another scene which is really clever actually is a scene where Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert trying to hitchhike so staying at the side of the road and Clark Gable,0.085120566
he thinks is really clever,0.14901948
he think he knows all the different ways to get the cars attention by waving her arms in a certain way or stick a knightly thumb in a certain way and all it's get the driver's attention and he tries lots of different variants,0.09876083
it tries about six or seven times he throws every time,0.085288465
so then call that Kolbert,0.0908211
she comes up and she just sticks her leg out and it says go up above the knee,0.3723362
and then the first driver stop straightaway that's a very funny scene,0.13159694
another scene which is really famous film actually when they're on the bus there's his character called Oscar Shapley who is sitting next to cool debt Colbert's character,0.09457672
and he's a character who talked to really quickly,0.09534166
and he's obviously very attracted to pull that whole box,0.15517959
so he gets,0.0646239
so he's saying all these things that are trying pressor and he's just a very funny quite annoying character,0.31089434
and there's a few very funny scenes which is in which stand out quite a lot,0.09263462
and his character was actually part of the inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny,0.0837069
and it was actually a scene where Clark Gable is leaning on a fence and is eating the carrot and that also was actually part of the inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny as well in terms of what I don't like about this film,0.085627526
I suppose the plot is a little bit predictable,0.16893359
especially the the way the film ends is quite standard,0.052929223
really you almost expect it to end a certain way,0.10998413
well I did anyway from my point of view I found ending a little bit predictable not that's a bad thing but there are some other romance films particularly ones like Casablanca which end in a way that you don't expect roses film ends in a way which I was expecting I could almost see it going in this direction,0.0953354
and I wasn't surprised by how the film ended at all,0.06579487
I was not to say that I didn't like how the film ended I did like the way it ended but it just it wasn't that surprising perhaps a little bit predictable,0.09715645
but again that's not necessarily a bad thing,0.05591898
so all in all I have to say that it happened,0.06925893
one night is a fantastic romantic comedy,0.15273048
I think most people should be able to enjoy this,0.07842087
it's it's a fairly easy film to watch these two characters quite a bond call that although they're both such likeable characters in this film the on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic,0.084728785
and overall,0.049466502
it's a very enjoyable film to watch so I'm going to give and one night a rating of 8 out of 10,0.22571445
I don't think it's a fantastic bill,0.07918046
but I do think it's a very good classic romantic comedy and probably one of the best romantic comedies from this sort of error that I've seen so there we go,0.08896607
so that is it happened one night,0.07185943
so what do you guys,0.07728548
think have you seen,0.07203299
it happen tonight would you like to see it,0.11041377
