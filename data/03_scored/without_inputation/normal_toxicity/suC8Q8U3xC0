oh boy what's going on that day YouTube,0.18223198
this is SEL zero feature zero representing James yes I'm about to review the most anticipated movie of the year 2017 Star Wars the last Jedi here we go all rights to go first off Ron Johnson de directed looper came on talked about how he was like vicious and wanted to change the scope of how this movie's gonna be worked as far as the Star Wars franchise as far as this guy Walker Stan fries then opposite from what they've been doing with anthology films,0.15481688
and then on top of that he's been confirmed doing his own trilogy from what he was able to do with this,0.12156213
I'm very intrigued what he's gonna do with his own trilogy because he would do if he was ever the directors very well,0.15719032
but let's go ahead to the different things about the movie from the set pieces from the set designs to the practical effects to the practical creatures,0.058828775
and the lifelike things throughout the entire movie this was a very well made sci-fi film like as far as just the production design the scope,0.059794083
it was beautiful,0.08522255
some of the moments like really surprised me everything with the temple the Jedi Temple location on the island I thought was just amazing some of the imagery they were able to do with ray and with Luke and different time jumps and different thought processes of how things are happening,0.052904464
what things are happening are just amazing like they're very much so inspiring to actually watch and see towards the third egg there's this one moment on this planet is basically made of salt,0.13881333
I've never seen anything like this in a Star Wars film that off the gate,0.068443604
I can promise you you're gonna be like wow,0.09737962
the very opening of the movie there is amazing,0.054242555
like battle sequences,0.08064397
some of the probably the best battle sequences they've ever had in any Star Wars movie and throughout the movie like a the way they actually able to do the cinematography there were moments,0.045339502
I was like yo what's about to go down,0.17840958
the sea this movie is excellent,0.08634914
it's actually superb,0.088552244
it certain difference extends from the way they would do certain things,0.06083025
I'm trying not to say too much,0.10979578
this is a non school to review of course as far as the soundtrack the soundtrack to me was better than the force awakens,0.074975684
but it doesn't elevate it to that upper level,0.05777503
you know to where I've seen John Williams go,0.07292334
but this is definitely a step up and in the right directions,0.082722835
there are certain moments where the music you change the shifts when there is dialogue between two certain characters,0.035214838
and definitely the sequences wherever is on the island whenever is actually in space and whenever like supreme Snoke is brought into the fold into this movie,0.08176041
I'm not going to talk to you about anything what the characters are doing,0.081514575
but I can definitely say from a performance standpoint,0.054275423
this is definitely Mark Hamill's possibly his best since the Empire Strikes Back performance of Luke Skywalker like he nails the sky work,0.105665006
if you've ever doubted you know what he was able to do what he should be,0.11013917
what you think you should go regardless of what direction Luke is being platformed into this movie Mark Hamill nails it Daisy Ridley again powerhouse the sings that it was weird there was one scene in the dark that surprised me because they really just acted it so well like that motion was just dripping and it was like a dark sequence,0.15030669
I don't think I've ever seen like a well cried out moment like that in the dark this actually been filmed um Adam driver was given a lot to do in this one as far as acting and ability physicality,0.15239312
they gave him a lot to work with in this one um John boyega towards the third act,0.08356359
I really loved what they did with him,0.075768866
but as far as what they do with his character that is where I started getting to nitpicks and possibly negativity standpoint just because of the way that they platform his arc as opposed to Wade they platform his art in the force awakens,0.100653015
I don't like necessarily what they did with the connection of his character to everything is happening,0.06803165
but I did enjoy the entertainment value of him interacting with this new carryin rose and what they had to do and him his self-assurance about who he's supposed to be,0.16310832
Pro Dameron had to me a better arc than what they did with Dom boyega's character and Finn in this one because I can see where Poe is going you know I'm saying,0.098709814
and oh my gosh r.i.p to Carrie Fisher because see I don't call her goddess,0.3998311
but what they were able to do with her,0.05987876
it was beautiful,0.08522255
it was beautiful,0.08522254
there is a negative that I can say about what they did with her character in certain instances that I feel like this is where I get into the negatives of the film I feel like the film is so ambitious has so much potential of story weight and elevation that I felt like they pulled back,0.06277068
you know I'm saying the punch like there,0.28196514
were certain moments in this movie that like I never saw coming,0.07024803
there are certain revelations that I was just like what but at the end of the day from the storage standpoint of this movie it was everything that I wanted it to be from the battles from the action to the process of what the Skywalker's have been dwell with this whole entire under lock of you know the first order and Snoke like you get all these boasts of information and these great performances and these consequences that are built in literally you can see them like right in front of you right in front of your face,0.11459048
but in the end of the day when I leave the movie there are questions that,0.04984518
I'd literally marked on the page of paper like five different questions,0.1505337
only two of those questions got answered,0.05300107
and when I was hoping for and those two questions weren't what I wanted what what I thought were gonna be,0.06866626
and then the other three never got answered it's stuff,0.105805755
oh I left the movie with more questions,0.0810326
and because I left the movie with more questions I don't know where to rank this movie,0.08245671
I don't even know if I necessarily can give this movie a rating but I'm gonna try my best with that because I love business of this film I love the way it was directed,0.10108005
I love the way the performances were in his movie,0.08396222
I love the fights,0.24011874
I love the battles,0.095622644
I haven't told you guys anything about the meat of this when I get to my school review there are certain Easter eggs are certain moments dude,0.10735264
they I just cannot,0.074013084
Oh but at the end of the day I can't say that this is the best a kid,0.06941211
I just I personally I personally cannot because of some of the questions the answers I got to the questions didn't merit of positive reinforcements response,0.06213107
and then some of the questions I happen of course witness didn't get answered and now there's more questions because now I have no idea where this is going to go,0.05845622
and at the end of the day I put myself in the shoes of those you know back in the 70s when they looked at between a new hope and Empire Strikes Back or in-between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi where you just kind of just like what happens,0.094119616
now like that is how I feel,0.067228
and if you're able to do that and convey that as a director you've done your job,0.0864256
that's why I say that he is merited a franchise because go ahead give me another trilogy and make me think make me want to have questions,0.12208108
but I think that if some of those questions would have just wait for that gut punch and just went there and took it specifically there are certain moments,0.17507018
in the third eye,0.0492698
I felt like that should have went a totally different way because there are two different characters,0.05738105
and the way that they're gonna be platformer,0.07024642
no next is four different characters and the way they're gonna be platformed,0.054020096
next,0.028648289
I don't know that it makes sense,0.08173929
and that's all,0.048579313
I can say I'll give this move a point five out of ten I want to give it a nine but I'm gonna wait on that so I'll rest out of nine but I'll pull back and say eight point seven it was a really good movie,0.07199219
I really enjoyed it thoroughly,0.096158855
I cannot wait to watch it again,0.11599284
this is my most anticipated movie this year,0.060117695
but I think that I shouldn't have had as many questions as I do have,0.07105395
and that's not to discourage anybody you're gonna go into this movie,0.12458343
you're gonna enjoy you,0.1067519
we see this movie and IMAX the visual effects are great the performances are great you're gonna get so much out of this and the richness of it you know especially if you've seen the force awakens and if your songs been this definitely elevates you moving forward but you're gonna ask yourself a lot of perplexing questions about things that happen with certain characters things that don't have my certain characters,0.080092125
and then questions about the background of certain characters where I feel like if a little bit of background a little bit of foundation was kind of like late in this movie for certain characters dude,0.07473126
it would merit anyway,0.088067375
you want to take any of these characters personally so that's all I gotta say hopefully y'all,0.10794812
enjoyed this review keeping a lot JVs Wingstop there will be a full review coming very soon in addition to that on the 17th we're gonna be doing a spoiler discussion keep it alive JVs,0.07726344
we ain't gonna stop may the force be with you these guys,0.10355873
