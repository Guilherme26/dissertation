the big thing that the short story and the film have in common is the,0.008672664

wife after forming his theory Jefferies spends most of his time searching for clues by,0.022292964
spying through his camera lens to eventually uncover the sinister truth however the more interesting,0.07219105
part to me is where these two stories are different and that's the element of,0.007324337
romance as we've touched on already a lot of the characters in Hitchcock's film are,0.021272574
involved in a relationship of some kind notably and most importantly our main character lb,0.0094349645
Jefferies who is pretty much ready to give up on his dating relationship with his,0.07970364
girlfriend Lisa you'd think that since this element of romantic love is such a prominent,0.054455925
part of the film upfront there would be some semblance of it in the short,0.028386712
story right but that's not the case at all in fact the character of Lisa,0.019557064
is completely absent from the short story which instead leans completely on the thrills and,0.021384323
suspense of Jefferies playing private investigator and of course Cornell Woolrich the author of the,0.050778788
short story executes this to great effect in fact I included a link to the,0.023103824
free PDF version in the description if you'd like to check it out yourself but,0.06744363
the absence of romance in the short story is all the more telling that it's,0.011395261
inclusion in the movie was a very deliberate choice by Hitchcock so what kind of,0.053769454
love story was Hitchcock trying to tell here well let's take a look at the,0.022211812
first act to learn what kind of relationship Jefferies and Lisa have at the beginning,0.023649273
of the story we know from what we see in the opening shots that Jefferies,0.052031994
is an accomplished and well-traveled photographer and prides himself as a free spirit and an,0.01097553
adventurer in fact the reason he broke his Lake in the first place was because,0.02575458
he put himself in harm's way to get that perfect photo but when it comes,0.09592946
to Lisa he doesn't seem to think she's very interested in getting her hands dirty,0.23234296
with a mess of adventure she's just not the girl for me yeah she's not,0.2854239
me perfect she's too perfect she's too talented she's too beautiful she's too sophisticated she's,0.11486325
too everything but what I want while this relationship dynamic is being set up Hitchcock,0.030412197
periodically gives us glimpses into the lives of the neighbors including one who seems less,0.027821306
concerned with his surroundings than anyone else a musician now in the beginning of the,0.03326517
film we can see and hear that this guy is beginning to compose a piece,0.033931684
of music on a piano we only hear bits and pieces and kind of get,0.05883416
the impression that there's still a lot of work to be done before the song,0.022987416
will be complete as he fishes around for a melody the inclusion of the musician,0.041487504
might initially seem like just another part of the neighborhood flavor but before we explore,0.026109124
exactly why this character is so significant let's bounce back over to the relationship between,0.018290555
Jefferies and Lisa a few scenes later we see that a lot of Geoffrey's doubts,0.040399265
about their future seem to be justified although they clearly have affection for each other,0.060879603
lisa has high-class tastes and seems preoccupied with things that are frivolous in the eyes,0.12885538
of Jefferies both of which contrasts with his modest and down-to-earth personality can you see,0.05167612
me driving down to the fashion salon and a jeep wearing combat boots on a,0.07353006
three-day beard this disagreement sends an already tense relationship into further turmoil and we feel,0.03613078
the frustration between them both now it's at about this time that Hitchcock guides our,0.051707387
attention back to the musician who's continuing to work on his piece of music but,0.02461512
we see that he's dealing with some frustration of his own at this point we,0.04382496
can start to connect the dots that the progression of the musician's songwriting is developing,0.02037524
in tandem with the relationship of our main characters following it from a vulnerable place,0.016523162
where it was still new and clunky to a place where it's on the verge,0.10603626
of falling apart this connection between music and character becomes even more apparent at around,0.040062014
the story's halfway point when Lisa has finally accepted that thorwald is acting suspiciously and,0.02608318
she decides to break into the man's apartment to dig for clues and evidence herself,0.08649982
as Jefferies watches helplessly from across the courtyard we hear the musicians piece of music,0.036096856
more prominently than ever before and it's now starting to show signs of growth and,0.026573421
progress this resonates directly with the progression of our main characters relationship because this is,0.011196371
the moment when Jefferies realizes that Lisa is willing to take a step in his,0.023610694
direction and embrace risk and adventure to things that he didn't see in her before,0.024899155
and then at the very end of the story after the terrifying face-to-face confrontation in,0.06952965
which Jefferies is thrown out of his apartment by thorwald who is subsequently arrested we,0.03470995
hear the completed version of the musician song play in all of its glory and,0.031025495
what do you know the name of the song finally becomes clear I can't tell,0.020560162
you what this music is meant to me while this reinforces the idea that the,0.053117573
relationship between Lisa and Jefferies has now fully blossomed we know that it's just the,0.017851533
beginning for them as if to acknowledge this Hitchcock gives us one final image Lisa,0.03540839
dressed in more casual clothing reads an adventurous book about the Himalayas indicating that she's,0.050818034
changed and is now embracing some of Geoffrey's values but the shot becomes more interesting,0.037691966
when she eventually puts her book down in favour of a fashion magazine yes she's,0.062282477
now embraced a lot of what Jefferies is passionate about but she's also preserved an,0.016147332
important part of herself in the process so many elements of this film managed to,0.01957968
say so much without a single word being spoken the opening shots of Jeffrey's apartment,0.061141685
informing us of his normal world and values the progression of the musicians song reinforcing,0.03507048
the ups and downs of our primary character relationship and our final image of Lisa,0.022823116
