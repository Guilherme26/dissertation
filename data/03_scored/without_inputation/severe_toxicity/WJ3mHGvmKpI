and Amy and they're the two main characters and they are very studious they're very,0.013755333
serious young women and the film starts on the second last day of school so,0.04923157

whatever they're gonna be doing after school and Molly and Amy have spent all of,0.010288395
their school career you know studying hard be very serious about it not being distracted,0.03319466
by parties by anything that was going on that other people were getting up to,0.044350453
because they wanted to get the best grades and they wanted to get into the,0.020096527
best universities and kind of set themselves up for you know their adult life which,0.02153399
is really cool and they're very happy with this they're their best friends they have,0.016670832
a really kind of sweet friendship they kind of do everything together and they've been,0.026488278
very happy with this and in fact I would say Molly um kind of Lords,0.057870314
a little bit over other people and she she's off you know I think it's,0.08507233
Yale that she's off to and she kind of just she's very kind of proud,0.122657865
as you should be for getting into a good university and you know she kind,0.13060349
of looks down a little bit on some of her so-called like slacker or party,0.26872146
kids in the school and this is all fine and dandy until on the last,0.08926432
day uh they kind of make a shocking discovery so they discover that in spite,0.07023142
of the fact that some of their classmates have had a great time they've partied,0.024168117
they've done what they want they've also gotten good grades and gotten into good universities,0.021106277
and this is just a shock and a revelation to them Molly and Amy particularly,0.03147117
Molly and they decide that what they're gonna do is gonna have one night and,0.029605994
they are going to kind of make up this four years of where they've not,0.02568274
gone to parties they've not had this sort of kind of teen high school experience,0.06387426
they're gonna make it up in one night and they're gonna go into the coolest,0.022813138
party and they're just gonna you know be teenagers for one night now kind of,0.04106711
as you can imagine hilarity ensues on this night because nothing really goes to plan,0.04960607
and it is a it is a very funny film I laughed out loud and,0.039603703
there were people in the in the theater with me just laughing out loud at,0.057920203
lots of points some of them are hilarious it's they're very kind of it's very,0.06598688
high and I love kind of teen I'm gonna put my hands up I love,0.11291226
kind of teen American high school films anyway but this one is very funny what,0.0556027
I love about this one as well is that the main character Molly she isn't,0.037792407
your stick-thin model type and then Amy she is a lesbian she's out she's proud,0.55952704
she's been out for two years she's trying to find a girlfriend um and the,0.045862418
block does not hinge on coming out either and then you've got you've got some,0.048093442
great queer up in this book so you've got Amy and then you've got Amy's,0.11374574
kind of love interest then you've got two side characters they're gay guys they're fabulous,0.23698483
they're kind of theatre and they're interested of doing these theater performances very flamboyant dresses,0.053466797
so there's some really great queer rep as well the parents are hilarious Lisa Kudrow,0.09765229
as Amy's mother is hysterical it's like a really small cameo but it's very funny,0.14613952
and I just kind of I loved the film I just thought it was fun,0.038480874
it was sweeted at heart to it it just it was it kind of talks,0.10626176
about friendship and first love and there's just so many wonderful wonderful elements of it,0.033588447
and I highly recommend it the other thing I love about this film is that,0.034669373
you've got two female leads which is fantastic and most of the storyline focuses on,0.04686086
female characters as well as well as the director so I'm trying to make a,0.03098492
conscious effort to not only watch films that have queer representation but also films that,0.0031722607
have female directors because unbelievably um it's not good Hollywood you still have to actually,0.13176756
look for films and this is this is slightly more of an indie film and,0.023256816
Olivia Wilde is the director she doesn't awesome job I think she's really created a,0.12739997
gorgeous kind of I think like a cult classic teen film that I love and,0.0463633
it honestly is and the reason why I'm actually sitting down and talking about it,0.07442939
is because it's it's my favorite film that I've possibly seen all year on in,0.01521408
a very long time really really really enjoyed it loved this film and I would,0.044822734
say so as if you like this you might like that if you like book-smart,0.085769445
watch it please if you do and you like it you might enjoy it slightly,0.08354972
older film crumbled 83 and I probably do a separate video batch of cat3 because,0.119506225
it's one of my all-time favorite films but you know look it up online it's,0.029437037
kind of got that same vibe that friendship that finding your way there's a queer,0.23596688
element and that as well so yeah I definitely think if you enjoyed book smart,0.09117273
you'll enjoy gypsy 83 so kind of those are my thoughts so what I'm gonna,0.124841005
do with my film reviews is I'm gonna give you three of my favorite things,0.02563884
about the film and then I'm just gonna tell you what the film makes me,0.017638674
feel so my three favorite films about the favorite things about this film is that,0.023671225
it was directed by a woman you've got an out-and-proud lesbian main character and the,0.11348166
story's not about coming out or her being a lesbian she just is and then,0.36004943
you've got a very strong female lead cast and a beautiful friendship and very positive,0.055034634
female friendships kind of Pro women um which is awesome to see and then for,0.11104775
me this film kind of looks like a it's kind of a Mardi Gras meets,0.24824247
clueless and this beautiful cinematography the colors are lovely and then the outfits and some,0.04427928
of the clothes are just really cool and quirky and fun then it kind of,0.03507846
