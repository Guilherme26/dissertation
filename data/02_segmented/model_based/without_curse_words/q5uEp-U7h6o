"What up? Peeps Tony Baker, Here back with another movie review? This time I'm reviewing The Irishman Martin Scorsese the epic Netflix saga that they slid out to theaters This three"
"It's three and a half hours long guys, but it reunited him with Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci"
"Once again, we all know they made magic with Casino and Goodfellas There's a straight magic"
"Goodfellas is easily hands-down one of my favorite movies of all time, So it's my by default, my favorite Martin Scorsese movie"
"Robert Deniro plays Frank Sheeran, Who's a you know real life character who you know worked with mob"
"You know, We're very closely with Russell Bufalino, played by Joe Pesci, who they brought out of retirement for this joint"
Joe Pesci's been shelling
He's been
I'm out the game
this one
I think I'm out
They pull me back
"They blue, leave a key and they say, like Robert and Martin had to really convince him to come do this movie"
"That must be nice, man you"
"when you're good, you just walk away from the game for years"
Be like I don't know
Like you're settled
You said you don't need the money
"whatever, and then you can demand whatever you want"
If legs look
give me seven million dollars to do this movie and Netflix like we had money
This movie costs a hundred and fifty million dollars To me
A hundred and fifty million dollars for drama
"This is ridiculous, man, man"
"Yeah, I bet you Joe was like, Give me 75 million dollars and there's our joke"
"Come on, please, Netflix"
"Man, we bottomed the Soviet baby Man three and a half hours, 150 million"
This is better be good
"Excuse my language, but man you know, and the critics loved it"
they was like Yo
this is a masterpiece
"Oh, and how can I forget who else is in this Al Pacino, So you got Alba Chino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci In one move, I'm saying the last time Al Pacino or Robert De Niro all together Real Righteous Kill, We just go forget about that"
That movie was Hot Guy
"Hot, Righteous Kill was a hot garbage"
It was like somebody took some garbage boiled
It added some seasoning
"You know, there's an old here, The garbage put in the bowl and served it hot"
But he
"that's the Pacino De Niro combo that we all love, so it's good to see them back again"
It's really the story about a guy Frank Sheeran
"He's Irish and he starts doing like you know, jobs with mob-connected men"
"He starts, you know, rising up the ranks doing doing odd jobs, or isn't it then? kind of doing hits a little bit"
"You know, I want to put a business out there, but you know, doing some real dirt and doing what he ever had to do for them"
Essentially it's like I'll do it
I'll do it
I'll do it
"you know, I mean, And so you still get that Scorsese"
"You know, people getting capped"
"We've come to expect like you know, people getting shot up"
You know this in here well at three and a half hours
It's gonna be the slow pace
It's a slow pace
It's a slow pace
"like, Because it goes through all these years ago it goes"
And so they're using this special effects thing
The D age
You know the actors and make them look older
Make them look younger
So they're doing all of this and some people thought it was distracting
I really didn't bother me too much
I was just like Okay
I couldn't
They never really made Robert De Niro look young
"No, like he was supposed to be mad"
Long ago he was still looking old
So they were trying to make him look young and they kind of fumbled
"Now I'm like he's still look old, but just smooth the skin"
That's all it was
He was an old man with smooth skin
It's like Yo
"this is me in my 20s, And he looked like Robert De Niro in his seventies with smooth skin"
That's the only
the only thing I really saw
"So basically is that and you know you, you get to see Robert De Niro's family how his daughter looked at him, and I thought that was a really interesting dynamic within the story is just how how his kids viewed what he was doing, Because a lot of times you don't really see that you see"
you know these guys have families
"Of course, but you don't really see like a kid that really doesn't like what you're doing and knows it"
"because kids, man, we out here, man we, we, we see what our parents do and it affects us for them to really play on that"
I really enjoyed that aspect of it because it was like Yo
I don't
I don't like what you're doing
"you know, Cuz, a lot of times kids don't feel like they have any place to say that to their parents or they just hold it in or they just become what their parents were"
"But it's good just to see like I'm not feeling this from a little girl throughout, you know, understands just to see that transition"
"Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa, He killed it In this movie"
He nailed it
"You know, a lot of times Al Pacino can go over the top"
He's been going over the top
"you know, in his later roles, All right man, just this, dial it back a little bit"
"No, I will"
"not, you know"
but in this it worked because that's the type of person Jimmy Hoffa was
"But if you look up Jimmy Hoffa like he was fiery like he, you know, he got the union's really going Like he was one of the main guys in the country Like it was the president, Then, like Jimmy Hoffa, And so what he was doing was really big"
Really important
And so I felt like you needed that type of delivery for Jimmy Hoffa and I thought he nailed it
"I thought he was a doe, very stubborn, but a dope character to watch you were all in, and you kind of respect how he wasn't scared of the mob"
"I like to see that even though most of the people in movies they just bow down to the mob, you know it was"
It was interesting to see a character that
"even though they can hurt you, he still never really backed down And I thought that was pretty dope, Joe Pesci's character, You know, Usually Joe Pesci in the Martin Scorsese movie He's the Hotheads fireball short, Wolverine, I kill you right now, I kill you"
"What's funny in my job to you was funny, you know, just a hot Headz volcano"
Now he's completely subdued quiet
"you know still, we'll get you cue, but it's very like understated quiet"
"But when he's around you feel the presence of like you know danger, Like serious business"
I can hurt you
"I can get things done and I love how Joe Pesci played it very understated, very chill, very quiet And it's like Yo"
it works
"And so you know, a lot of people are clowning it this long and slow, but I think they really just focusing on the wrong things like you know"
"Even though the the Age of Fire didn't really work all right, it didn't work"
but I could still focus on the story and the performances and I feel like it was a good time
I don't
I don't agree with what Martin Scorsese said about comic book movies
I'm not here for it
"You know, I think comic book movies are great cinema"
"You know you getting emotions, You go in there, you're crying, you're excited, you're on the edge of your seat"
you're laughing
What the hell else do you want From movies? You going there for to feel something? And you know Marvel movies have been providing that you know Martin every day know I had to be all serious
"and like you know, drawing from real people's it's about what you connect to"
the Hell
"if that's the case, you know Shakespeare, you know the stuff he wrote Romeo Giulia"
"There weren't real people, but everybody's been connecting with that format long"
"so Martin, just chill man"
Let's get these comic-book movies
"Man, We having a good time out here in these Marvel streets, Dc, you know, - Joker and the Dark Knight, not not the Justice League, because we all fumble"
"See, but man, we having a good time with these Marvel movies"
"Martin, Man, you watch it for the last Marvel movie Martin Scorsese watched Cuz, I guarantee you if you watch Infinity War and Endgame Man, you gonna feel something you know"
I'm gonna watch him watch it and see how can you not feel this dunk
"How can you not connect anyway? man, y'all want to know the Smooth jazz review, An Irishman here it is"
Oh yeah
I'm giving the Irishman four saxophones out of five
"four again, four saxophones again"
"What y'all gonna do? Self is quality, though its quality out"
"I think Martin was just mad, Cuz Marvel made a three-hour movie"
He's like I'm the one that's making the three-hour movie
"Oh, I can't call Alright, a piece"
That's my review of the Irishman Let me know what you thought of the Irishman in the comment section below
"Can you get through it? How long did it take you to watch it? Let me know in the comment section below, what you think of the performances from the from the lead actors And did you? were you able to just you know, get the longest of it out of your mind"
