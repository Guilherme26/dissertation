[Music] [Music] hi straight pass and welcome to my review of The Philadelphia Story this movie stars a Cary Grant Katharine Hepburn ugh Stewart this movie is big was based on a play Katharine Hepburn was apparently doing at the time and she decried the routing rights to it and she had it you know she she course stars in it and it's basically the story of Tracy lowered by Katharine Hepburn she was once married to Cary Grant's character CK Dexter Haven and you know they had a tumultuous marriage you know and of course he began to drink and of course because he had to deal with Katharine Hepburn's character her for perfect her need for perfection and he he said yeah yep old so they basically you know break up and they get divorced no matter Johnny I think that's like two years so in the past the story opens she's about to get married to another young man named George Kittredge and a newly rich guy gentlemen and of course this marriage is getting and I get covered by two characters James Stewart who plays Macaulay Connor and with hussy who plays Elizabeth Penn receive the photographer and he's the writer okay and the day before the wedding they come in as supposedly friends of the her brother of Traci Lords brother to cover the way and this is one of those comedies of manners and errors where things are things are under the surface that that things want to know baby CK Dexter Haven played by Cary Grant you know he you can tell he still has an affection for his wife even though his ex-wife in this case and she's getting married and he basically brings all he gets makes he blackmailed into bringing this the two reporters in to to cover this and of course Jimmy Stewart's character of Macaulay Connor he he's a writer and he gets blackmailer to covering it he doesn't really want to do this he wants to be a serious writer he really wants to quit the magazine and he works really a magazine I think they call it spies we like a tabloid magazine he really doesn't really want to work for a thing but he kind of has to you know he does it to appeal to survive and eat and this photographer I played by represses he plays Elizabeth Henry you can tell us he sort of has a crush on you know she has a torch for Janie's you know Jimmy Stewart's character and you know see this long-suffering and you know assistant he of the photographer and you know she goes along and he basically tells me yes you have to take this assignment you a crush you don't have to eat you know so they go along to this and during the course of its base B of a day-and-a-half guess Oh kind of things are unfold like I said Scott yeah that's good comedy but it's also a romance and it's also a drama about things that people say and simply about Catherine's got the Hepburn's character Tracy Lord for you basically getting to know her true self through her interactions with her ex-husband with his knit with this writer Macaulay Connor and also with her fiance played by John Howard who plays George Kidder's her newly rich fiance and like I said you have her little sister who's the old smart as a whip and you ever her father and she has this kind of it a strained relationship with her father so she I she has daddy issues and stuff and I which I think drives her a need to be young put the perfect okay which kind of drives away kind of I think kind of drove away or ex-husband played by Cary Grant and this is the young sense comedy that's really well done and again Jimmy Stewart won an Academy Award I think her Best Supporting Actor in this and he's really good at this because it is a guy who gets to know her and gets to you know gets a kind of henchman character to reveal her true self and so you see them interact so yeah it's a good chemistry out throughout the movie between Cary Grant of course and Katharine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and Katharine Hepburn and even Ruth has a huge ego the long-suffering photographer who's the assistant to a genius to his character and like I said it's a comedy and but it's also a drama and and it's really are well done Candice in Philadelphia story because that's where the marriage is taking a place and of course they're covering it so it's called the Philadelphia Story but it's really well done it really well acted and Katharine Hepburn just a really great actress and I don't know honey Academy Awards he won but she is really good in this and she plays the part to perfection and again Craig Wright you know it's not this movies much as a biggie is but he does play a fire role in this okay and of course you need to what is is excellent this is uh now cynical writer who's currently being forced to cover this you know this wedding that he really doesn't want to do but he comes to get to know you know Tracy's ordering and hurt his it and their interaction really kind of opens the character up so it's really uh a really well done movie like this screwball comedy but it's to me it's more of a drama a little romance and then the comedy is in there as well and I definitely really enjoyed the Philadelphia Story great back and forth between two characters so I'm gonna give the Philadelphia Story a nine out of ten it's really a really well-done movie I think they remade this as high society which I haven't seen I think that's the movie with that Frank Sinatra I think being Cosby and I think it's four named Grace Kelly I think that's I'm not sure about it but I think they remade it the Philadelphia Story as a musical cause because you know Frank Sinatra and they're and uh Bing Crosby I haven't seen that yet but this will be is really good I definitely highly recommend its criterion version and it has a ton of special features on this but I definitely highly recommend a Philadelphia Story one of those great classic poll you know Hollywood movies and you know I really love old Hollywood so definitely highly recommend this Philadelphia Story definitely see it anyway
