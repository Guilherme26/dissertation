hey everybody today I'm going to be reviewing of a favorite this film came out in 2018 it was directed by your ghost Don Tomas this film was a bit of a departure for Lent the most because it was the first film I think in his filmography that he did not write himself or or co-write his films tend to be very heavy on abstractions and the stories themselves and the themes are expressed a lot through metaphors and such and they aren't very literal and of course he has typically has a very distinct style of dialogue in his movies where the characters everything kind of goes against the rulebook where his characters really lack dimension and yet there's something very appealing about that in terms of the way his films work and he's exploring humans from the outside and a rather cold sort of sterile way rather than the more cerebral aspects that were used to the dialogue is very exaggerated very banal and very awkward highlighting kind of the satirical satirical aspects of social norms and honestly I know a lot of people think that this film is very different from the rest of his films and that it is a much more straightforward more literal story where it is kind of focusing more on the characters and their motivations and the more I guess you could say stereotypical way but honestly I think that at the heart of it everything is so similar even to his films that do have that more exaggerated more abstract style with the dialogue I think that it easily translates into this just in a more subtextual sense to me this film still carries a lot of the signatures and the things that we know and love about Al anthemic film this film just like his others is studying behavior and contrasting that between this kind of careful attention to etiquette and artifice and then contrasting that with just brutality and then idiocy really and using this particular narrative to highlight all of these ideas all of these themes we were looking at it depicted as a comedy of manners or kind of an absurdist piece where the humor especially in the screenplay and the humor just naturally Atlanta Moses works in terms of his vision I think meshed perfectly and they translate beautifully to screen film is is gorgeous to look at very immersive in its style a lot of fisheye lenses a lot of wide-angle lenses and deep focus all of this to create kind of a richness in a depth but also something that is slightly off so it sort of eases us into the surrealism because there is a bit of surrealism and there are a bit of abstractions in this film but it's very very subtle it's like the dissonance is like this needle that's just kind of slowly kind of creeping into the film just ever so slightly it is exquisite of course the set pieces and the costumes and the lighting and everything does remind me a lot of Barry Lyndon actually just in terms of the the cinematography but it is picturesque but I would say also in a way very grotesque almost gothic and it does help to emphasize that weird contradiction that people have between this sort of ignorance to the things that are really important the things that are paramount compared to emphasizing what is gratuitous there is a war going on but you don't really see any of that at all the opulence and the excess is at the forefront of the film because that is what is more important to these characters seemingly there at these elegant parties eating these exquisite hors d'oeuvres and yet they they aren't talking about the matter at hand the the country's well-being and I like the flow of this film there's a hypnotic quality to it and you sort of through that you see the elegance highlighted and contrasted with the violence and a lot of very kind of cheeky very fun ways like watching Abigail and Anne and they're they're dancing they're doing some sort of dance but you can hear the gunshots in the background you see Sarah getting dragged through the dirt by her horse after she's been poisoned by Abigail and that is contrasted or I should say it's cross cut with this this naked man inside the palace then they're throwing fruit not him in slow motion and just laughing I also like that they're emphasizing the personal relationships particularly between the three women rather than the politics whatever decisions you make in politics tend to come from things that happen internally and behind closed doors and this film really likes to show you a bit more of what happens behind closed doors and how it fuels those external aspects of the the characters but also what is most important is how what happens behind closed doors is used to manipulate people and to bend others towards your will this film is about women and all they're very complex shades it's about their strength and their power but also their their duplicity and their scheming and even at a certain point really resorting to violence there's an injury to the film you notice particularly in the clothing but with the women you're seeing how all of those things that sort of blend into different aspects of the emotional spectrum whether it is through sex or through love through hate or through deceit sex is a huge component in the film it is used in a myriad of ways when I look at the character of Sarah played by Rachel Weisz she is somebody I think that is very loyal and and very blunt to the Queen but she does it of course out of love because they've known each other so long so she can be brutally honest with her when she needs to but I think that there's more to her she's got a real a real strength to her a real sturdy core innocence that I think she relishes in having power I think that she likes to be the one making the decisions and sort of condescending a bit to the queen pampering the queen really she should probably be the one running things she might she should be the one who is the queen she is the one quite literally when you look at the costuming she is the one wearing the pants in the relationship so to speak but I think even though that she even though she loves the Queen she does use sex in order to gain that power she uses it as a way of maintaining her control and her dominance this film is so similar to one of my favorite Hollywood films of all time it came out in 1950 and that is the lady eve and abigail played by Emma Stone is Eve essentially this girl who has fallen on hard times and has clawed her way back to civility and will do anything she can to obtain regain her her status as a lady she's indulging the queen in the way that Sarah no longer does she is romanticizing everything and in a way that maybe the Queen isn't used to hasn't been used to in a long time and the Queen brilliantly played by Olivia Colman has the most pivotal role here to me she is absolutely true heart of the film the true emotion because she is so painfully lonely and pathetic and she is rotting at the center and is somebody who has lost a lot in her life and it has caged her it has made her incapable of living especially physically she has like gout in her legs the food that she's indulging in makes her sick all the time she's just become this physical manifestation of pain she needs love so desperately and it is so it is aggressively apparent she's nearly like a child and in the way that she behaves she needs attention and she can't accept truth or honesty anymore she doesn't want to accept love in its most real form anymore she wants to address and package in a more palatable way in the way that abigail is presenting but she too finds her way to discover her power amidst this triangle between Abigail and Sara they're fighting for her affection the key of course the symbolic key in this film being the rabbit of course the rabbits in the film are a huge metaphor that threads the film's internal I should say emotional logic together as the Queen says in the movie each rabbit represents the children that she has lost and she's using them to fill a void that can't be filled Sara recognizes that in her own way she sees how sad it is how she's using these rabbits to replace something that cannot be replaced she really refuses to pet the rabbit to acknowledge and acknowledge them she says no I won't do that it's my Cobb whereas with Abigail Abigail has that sentiment and that love that nurturing quality to her in terms of the way that she's caring for the rabbits and that is the key that is what draws those two together Abigail and and they find that common ground of emotional reason that Ann left is on to very ignorant Lee and of course eventually things escalate and Abigail eventually does turn and against her best friend Sarah when I think about that at first I found that to be a really deeply sad thing and it is a sad thing don't get me wrong but the more I think about it especially after seeing it the second time I find that Sarah is the one who might have the more happy ending here she is the one really when you think about it who is most free in the end yes is her political power yes she loses her status and more importantly her best friend but perhaps it will be a learning experience for her then again maybe not but I do think that she has a better chance of finding happiness than either of the other two the whole point of sapphires like these and absurdist comedies like these and you can even say the same in a way for All About Eve I think that they all reveal people trying very hard to cover up their flaws with with makeup and fancy clothes and expensive jewelry that they start to lose themselves and lose their identity yeah I know that's a very obvious thing to say but it's so easy for that to become trite because we do see it quite often but with this film I just think the art direction the embellishments the meson scene everything about it as beautiful as it is and as alluring as it is it is also like I said something grotesque about it it works with the characters but it also attracts them there are many facets within the art design within the dialogue of the characters that makes this film enticing but ultimately very eerie and haunting final shot is my absolute favorite moment in the film without question it's definitely the most surrealist the most abstract part of the film and to me is the closest to what length ammos actually say it's closer to lent the most as earlier works and his philosophy philosophy for me just as an artist it's a complicated image but it's a really powerful one it reveals exactly what I said about Anna not Abigail that they do end up prisoners caged by their own desires which does eventually cloud their judgment abigail worked so hard to finally be seen as a lady again to be a woman of royalty but she ends up a slave to and wants and needs just as she was before she is still a slave just this time she's in a palace and deeply unhappy for me and has the most tragic end of all because she wanted love and she saw that Romanticism at that nurturing aspect in Abigail but she realizes too late that Abigail doesn't care about her and sees Abigail squash the little rabbit with her heel and that's the moment when she realizes that this girl is a and she's somebody that couldn't be trusted all along but rather than recognize that and sent her away her loneliness her need for a love kind of again clouds her judgment and she asserts her dominance as one does to protect themselves and she asks for sex from her I shouldn't say she asked for it she demands it of her she's trying so hard to maintain that control and her face in that last moment is absolutely heartbreaking there is nothing you phoric or sexy and in this climax instead you just feel her pain and her loneliness and she's more disconnected than ever before and then Abigail - she has been reduced to the lowest of the low the way that their face is the way they transpose the faces over one another I think allows us to see how they are the same they are both prisoners they are the rabbits that are caged trying to fill their voids with one another and it is not working they lost themselves in the hunt for something true and even earlier in the film when abigail first admires the rabbits and says that you know again they represent the children that she lost and that a little bit of her died with each child and now all she has is the rabbits seeing all of those rabbits sort of oval overlap is a very creepy image it's claustrophobic feeling but it completely works this is a very well-done film I think I think it's one that accentuates lanta most strengths as well as proving that he has a level of maturity and slice of textual maturity and I didn't really expect that much from him as he is deviating a little bit from his comfort zone it's exciting it's exciting to see I'm a big fan and I look forward to what he does next and that is my review thank you all for listening all of my social media information is below you can watch more
