hey everybody today I am going to be reviewing rear window this film came out in 1954 and it was directed by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950s where Hitchcock really hit his stride where he had the most creative control and he really didn't work his way through the ranks people tend to forget that but he had been working a long long time you know he had one or sorry Rebecca the film Rebecca had won best picture at the Academy Awards I think 14 years prior and little by little he built his signature style and then it kind of came to fruition became most prominent in the 50s at this point he was making movies like strangers on a train which I love and films like dial M for murder which is quite similar to this film in the sense that it is about a murder and it all for the most part takes place in one area like a play and it also stars Grace Kelly I don't think it's as mature thematically as rear-window would absolutely worth your time and then along comes through window which is of course one of his more memorable works any time that somebody I know somebody who maybe has never seen a Hitchcock film I usually tend to recommend this one for them to start out with just because I feel as though it really encapsulates everything that hitch is about in terms of what he wants to say and many of us don't have that thematic thread that carry throughout a lot of his films but I feel like this one is is kind of going a little bit deeper and in yet it's still very entertaining it's still very mainstream rear-window is in many ways just a commentary on the act of viewing a film a commentary on the audience as warriors and I think that the movie brings those ideas out in in ways that are very sophisticated just in in terms of the storytelling and of course building that slow tension in a way that only Hitchcock really could at that time the idea itself is an ingenious premise having your protagonist be immobile the James Stewart character has broken his leg and he's he's stuck in his apartment in the middle of the summer to pass the time he watches his neighbors in his apartment complex with his little binoculars he sees all of their different stories makes judgments about them and all of that and then he begins to suspect that one of his neighbors might be involved in a murder but he doesn't have the concrete evidence to back this up it's just great it's the perfect mystery thriller set up the film opens with one those classic Hitchcock shots where he sets up all you need to know in one single shot he's really really good at this we see the entire apartment complex we get a very good indication of who each neighbor is just in this one shot which is also mirrored in the last shot of the film as well where it comes full circle and then we move into the apartment where we see James Stewart and we see that he has a broken leg that he's confined to a wheelchair and this is all in one shot everything is set up exactly everything you need to know and again this is all in one shot you know we see everything that we need to see there's nothing superfluous there's nothing to break it up and we don't need any other information other than that it's pretty perfect one thing that I really love is that the majority of everything that you hear in the film is diegetic it's all within the world of the film most of the music and all of the sounds and all of that so the characters are always conscious of it and you don't see that very often in movies you usually hear like a musical score I'm very used to hearing this big sweeping Bernard Herrmann's score when I you know see a Hitchcock film of course that was kind of before that point but still but here you don't get that you know hear you all the sounds that you hear for the most part are from radios they're from cars you hear the piano being played by the the composer the pianist on the bottom floor you hear car honks and sirens and the way each sound is employed right at the perfect moment to build the suspense is quite ingenious they put a lot of effort into the sound design and that's quite evident because the sounds are really aligning with what happened on-screen and not in a way where it's like hammering you over the head it's not overwrought in any way it just kind of paints the perfect backdrop for the subject it just all adds to the the immediacy it really immerses you in that world and you know as I said I love the Hitchcock scores they are iconic a lot of them but this one does not need a score and in the same way that the birds really didn't need to score either it's a way to play with the tension a way to play with the expectations of the audience when you have like a diegetic music and stuff like that in place of a score there's a lot less of the manipulation going on of course there always is going to be manipulating manipulation when you're watching a movie but this one is a little bit different scores purposely help to guide the viewer and they help you to evoke certain emotions our times and here you just don't really have that luxury so a woman can be getting strangled you know in the window across from the James Stewart character and you'll likely hear something like smooth jazz or something that is very out of place and it's it's disturbing but very realistic and of course that makes it feel a little bit wrong a little bit more disturbing and constantly throughout the movie all the different characters around the protagonist are off they're always asking him why are you doing this and you know are you sure you should be peeking into these people's lives the way you are at what point does it go too far James Stewart is the perfect protagonist to play the the Geoffrey's character because he is and I mean he was at the time one of those guys that everybody loved he he stood for the everyman so it's it's perfect casting he represents the audience in the same way that like Kyle McLaughlin represented the audience in Bluebell but as lawyers it's the person who gets to sit back and watch everything take place no matter how disturbing and they are in complete control whereas everything outside is not and as lawyers we can vicariously live through the characters on the screen in movies right you know we project our own feelings and our own stories on to them and to me that's a very powerful thing about movies and just about art in general I think that sort of thing has the power to change people's lives in the way that they view the world and even in this movie seeing all the different neighbors through their windows it's like each window is its own little movie screen or they even look like panels in a comic book and I think that's really cool because you know really movies are sort of windows into a different world aren't they and so that really illustrates that idea I think that the perfect example of the voyeurism here though would be with the Miss Lonelyhearts character she's a woman who lives on the bottom floor she's middle-aged and she's a very lonely person and we start to see progressively throughout the movie that she is suicidal she's aging and she doesn't have anybody special in her life Jeffries feels sympathetic of course but maybe at the same time he might see what he might become because you know in the movie there's that dynamic between him and the Lisa character played by Grace Kelly the idea of will he marry her won't he and I think Lisa also when she sees Miss Lonelyhearts she also kind of feels the same way it's that fear of of being sad and alone but they get to peek into this person's life without her knowing and they get to project their own story their own feelings about their own relationship on to her but then there's that tinge of sourness that comes with that as well you know because it's it's at that point that Lisa begins to question whether or not she should be watching this sort of stuff because there is that kind of sadistic quality of getting to see people go through such anguish but it still gives you that control getting to see somebody else and live their life and all of that and while you can feel for them you don't have to directly be involved in their lives so it gives you that that great control and we want that feeling without experience that experiencing it directly and you know classic horror tropes of people being butcher humiliated tortured all of that it's for us as viewers it's cathartic it arouses our emotions in such a way but again it's it's in a controlled environment we know we're gonna be okay at the end of the day we're not gonna get butchered ourselves and I think that's perfectly normal to a certain extent but at what point does all of that start to become gratuitous and when does it become unnecessary it starts to reveal a certain level of cynicism and darkness within us that we may need to examine another thing that I really kind of think is cool about this movie and I didn't really think about until watching it this last time is just the way that the characters as they're watching the neighbors how they make assumptions about them and it's the same with us you know the way we judge people as boyars Jeffries sees all of these people around him but he doesn't know their whole stories all he can do is really infer based on what he sees beyond that his knowledge is unreliable as is ours as audience members we only see what we're shown and we don't really know these characters and that's part of why the murder is so interesting because we really don't know whether or not he's truly seeing what he thinks he's seen and there are moments in the dialogue where we see all that reflected naturally you know like where the Thelma Ritter character says that we should look inward sometimes for a change and and their Grace Kelly a character saying that you know it's really kind of disease that you've got all of these opinions about these people that you don't even know and you know it's a good thing that she's not alive in the millennial generation all of these factor into what we perceive as viewers ourselves and how that can that can be kind of dangerous so of course hitch is very conscious of the way he's manipulating us he always has been he's always kind of seen that is as funny to him he's amused by the way he can pull the strings with audience members it gives him complete control but I think here is kind of the first kind of tip into a different direction where he's starting to really explore that idea more and we see that go way further in films like like vertigo which came out a few years later he started to make those connections about artists as commentary on society not only does this movie implement those devices really exquisitely but it's also just I mean it's just really entertaining on a basic level and you know I think that the script like a lot of the films around this time that he's making the script is just really witty the characters are are so likeable and relatable which is is key everything is choreographed and so meticulously well built as I said and I love that he's pushing himself a little bit more and I do think this is one of his better films for sure and yeah if you've never seen a Hitchcock movie this is a great place to start and that is my review thank you all for listening all my social media
