I never knew I needed to see a dark romance featuring The Creature from the Black Lagoon but then again if I can get behind a dark romance featuring a cat dude and Sarah Connor anything is possible I guess you hey then movie chick here and today reviewing the shape of water Guillermo del Toro is quite possibly one of my all-time favorite directors his hauntingly beautiful and gothic designs and backdrops though relatable and quirky characters the grand and fantastical spectacles each film exudes while still maintaining its own individuality very much akin to Kubrick's filmography whether it's a straight-up horror movie a coming-of-age story a comic book hero flick Bronte s ghost story or a beat-em-up kaiju film I adore how del Toro is not afraid to let his freak flag fly and how he isn't afraid to change it up with each film while they do still carry very similar themes honestly if I were to nitpick any of his films I real only have a short list and that would be crimson peak and Pacific Rim and for the same reason the main actor playing central protagonist ends up giving the weakest performance as well as being the most least interesting character amongst a very colorful cast I have nothing against Charlie Hunnam but if you pitted him against eager Salva I would pick Elba every time also Rinko Kikuchi had a way more intriguing an emotional backstory and was the true underdog in the narrative and then you have Mia Wasikowska I don't think I've ever seen the girl emo I don't blame her for the Alice in Wonderland movies but she's got no excuse in films like Jane Eyre and crimson peak when she's supposed to be clearly terrified or in love she just looks like she's doped up on valium or popped a couple of xanies off-screen I can't stand her acting and she really brought the film down for me but you should still give it a watch for the gorgeous set design and Jessica Chastain being [ __ ] amazing as per usual so the shape of water first sparked as an idea that Deltora had at six years old when he first watched Creature from the Black Lagoon and wondered when actress Julie Adams would shack up with the creature unconventional romances are nothing new for Del Toro but Hellboy didn't get me nearly as emotional as shape of water the story follows an orphaned mute girl Eliza who works late hours at a science facility as a janitor with her best friend of ten years Zelda however her simple and uneventful life is turned upside down when Colonel Richard Strickland shows up with a mysterious entity in a large container unable to suppress her curiosity Eliza discover Strickland has an ethereal sea creature help captured four painful horrifying experiments the unlikely duo form a bond inspiring Eliza to risk everything to try and break the creature free but how long can she keep him safe before the obsessive entwisted Strickland uncovers the truth Sally Hawkins as Eliza is probably the best performance I've seen this year I'm sorry Franco but you come at a close second I've seen Sally Hawkins and a few other projects including fingersmith though personally the handmaiden is a far superior adaptation and you should check that out and said but I digress regardless she is superb in this movie to be the only character without a voice takes a lot of nuance and talent she's not simply some demure innocent sheltered girl she's a grown woman who has been made to feel left out by society and that she is an outcast and unworthy of love she is unabashedly a woman with relatable needs and desires Sally Hawkins also learned sign language for this film and personally I feel she pulled it off very well I mean I'm no expert of sign language I I've only seen children of a lesser God but for me she was pretty damn convincing however her characters only further enhanced by those around her so let's start with her gain a burn confidante Giles played by Richard Jenkins he is probably the one who got me the most emotional in this film he's an older man who's a recovering alcoholic who's trying to get his life back together but also rediscovering his new self as a gay man in the 50s at first he purposefully closes himself off from the world and will only live vicariously through his obsession of film and music it's something I can heavily relate to back when I was in my early 20s I suffered from depression I never left the house I became a complete shut-in and the only thing that kept me going was my love of film it was sort of that escapist fantasy that took away the pain that I was feeling Jenkins actually has a scene in this film that got me the most upset and teary-eyed not only does he have to face discrimination at one point but he watches other people who he finds are just as much pain as he is he's through that taught to be brave and selfless Brea's Eliza already having these qualities she learns self-worth Michael Shannon as Richard Strickland creep me the [ __ ] out a strict religious man who's very prejudiced and only knows the rules that he's been taught to live by get married have kids buy house get an expensive car and a cushy job and yet he is very dissatisfied and it really starts to mess with his mental state especially when he comes across the creature and meeting Eliza I think Shannon is an enormous ly talented actor who can play an eclectic variety of roles but I always feel he's at his best when he plays a villain not just because of his unique look but because he knows how to add layers to that kind of character and give them a really great doctor hofstetler portrayed by Michael Stolberg it's also a very surprisingly layered character and I feel very vital to the themes of this film especially for today's audience he is a Russian spy pretending to be one of the scientists at this facility so he can also study the creature for his country however he develops a strong conflict between serving his own people and having this genuine admiration for the said creature I was constantly on edge whenever he was on screen because I was never sure what fate had in store for this character I was really surprised I felt any kind of empathy for him at all like it's not usually the case in these type of movies Octavia Spencer plays Zelda the best friend and co-worker of Eliza while she doesn't get much to do for the central plot what seeing she does have she knocks him right out of the park she gets the funniest lines but she also gets some really great tense moments especially between her and Michael Shannon lastly we need to talk about Del Toro's longtime partner in crime Doug Jones what can i really say about his portrayal that i can't say about his other incarnations just like andy serkis this man has made a living out of playing characters solely in elaborate prosthetics and makeup and he's damn good at it his character just like Eliza is also without a voice but his body language and facial expressions speak volumes he also exudes a much more sexual energy about him and has a lot of romantic charisma with sally hawkins it was handled in a very poetic and mature way but yeah I can see people finding this a bit strange for me this isn't anything new I love beating the Beast for example no not that one look god no there you go I'll be at a very dated and oddball edie show I really bought the chemistry between Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton it probably also hoped that I was obsessed with the TV show gargoyles at a much younger age god I was a rude kid also for anyone who's familiar with del Toro's work this is a very Brady ture movie lots of tits and ass and some squeamish gore it's not as like overblown as say Eli Roth's films are but he knows how to set up a gore scene to make you just feel uncomfortable and stressed out to the point that it sometimes is hard to watch I still can't watch the face slicing seen from Pan's Labyrinth this is a film if I had to put it in the simplest of terms is basically a gothic mashup of the Iron Giant and splash like a really rated R in all seriousness this is definitely Gil Armel del Toro's best word right up there with Pan's Labyrinth everything fits together there's not one stale performance in the bunch the cinematography is creative as well as a set design music feels like an updated haunting recreation from classic Hollywood scores I really dug the hell out of this film and I could watch it again and again and catch what are you still doing here go see this movie as soon as you can but not before subscribing to my channel and liking this video
