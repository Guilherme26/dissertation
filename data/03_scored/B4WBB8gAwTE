island with Luke it was great is as gruff and grumpy as Luke was he,0.27771485

the last movie I'm glad we saw a bit more of him in this movie,0.11402488
we saw a lot more of him actually there were a couple things that moved,0.09888347
it straight of reminded me of Battlestar Galactica's like Rian Johnson was like oh I,0.11718291
love Battlestar Galactica I'm gonna put that in a Star Wars movie that sounds awesome,0.11526921
right because they weren't they were cool and I will say this about the movie,0.08215302
when a character is in danger you do feel that danger I love that how,0.09192116
many movies out there the characters in peril you're like yeah whatever I know they're,0.07956177
fine there's something about the craftsmanship in this one Rian Johnson was like this is,0.053445984
how you should make a movie like there's that feeling of security is gone so,0.064249866
few times does it happen in a film which the movie has a lot of,0.07603563
humor in it too there's no thing quite a few times the last time the,0.08113208
human didn't land as much as they probably wanted it to point is if that,0.107105166
JJ Abrams humor irritated you in episode 7 it's still in episode 8 so probably,0.10528248
irritate and visually speaking Ryan Johnson is on another level of directors less lens flares,0.24218918
I could say that the action sequences are great just space battles look fantastic the,0.058190417
ground battles look fantastic the movie just looks beautiful there is one scene in this,0.12870042
movie in particular that it's just it's such an orgasmically gorgeous moment it happens and,0.48346442
it's there and you're watching it you're like I want that poster or screensaver or,0.11952906
wallpaper on the phone another scene I'm talking about the movie will go on you'll,0.08142894
be like is that that and then it'll happen a bit like that's exactly what,0.08980847
he's talking about the Finan what's her name rose i think her name's rose finn,0.12590691
and rose that arc is the one room like and it just didn't really work,0.059435792
for me this is actually it's the arc i can talk about that's not a,0.051730968
spoiler and the fact that it's not a spoiler the fact that i feel like,0.056356445
i can talk about their arc but i don't feel like i can talk about,0.07142012
a lot of the other arc shows how just insignificant their arc is they go,0.24119091
to a dump planet that bores me and just when they're on their mission rest,0.35729516
assured you can leave the theater to take a piss you're welcome internet i mean,0.37118298
it has a lesson behind it and that is animal cruelty is bad i have,0.12783197
an animal lover right I'm there for the message I smell like did you bring,0.38218078
them to that planet to have that message in a Star Wars movie because it,0.08800251
really does detract from the movie as a whole it's clearly when the movie bogs,0.08360338
down I've seen a couple of people on Twitter say the movie feels too long,0.10880111
it's that scene if you take that out you could shave off a half an,0.21757041
hour off this movie I mean when it got to that that was cool for,0.14178488
him but that then brings me to phasma who is in this movie and it's,0.41585448
not like it's some big comebacks not like they were like oh we didn't really,0.11353344
use phasma in the last movie now here's her chance to shine that's like we,0.17411326
didn't use her in the last movie and she's just as useless here's the bum,0.7093121
phasma underwhelmed me snoke underwhelmed me yeah the big super baddie that was built up,0.33271918
in the first movie now we're gonna see more room here the movie and I,0.07591623
mean this in the most complimentary way goes in bold new direction unexpected directions things,0.09306712
that Star Wars really hasn't done and when you do bold directions in Star Wars,0.050563354
with established lore that nerds like me can kind of quantify sometimes you like mr.,0.6364068
Spock fascinating sometimes you're like han Solo that's not how the force works narrative Lee,0.12976375
speaking I cannot think of another Star Wars movie taking the same flight path proverbial,0.054842006
flight path the last Jedi Tech there are some things I love about that and,0.054767728
there are some things I just didn't like and that's why this movie's definitely one,0.06382513
of those movies it's like you might you're gonna have to watch this twice and,0.1364394
I really want to watch this movie again so I can really see if the,0.068655126
flaw still stick with me if I forgive them time fades everything time fades greatness,0.1619947
and time fades flaws all depends on which side of history and movies on guys,0.09431078
in the end the last Jedi is admittedly complex but there are a couple things,0.07368586
in this movie that leave you feeling unfulfilled Luke was great Rey was great kylo,0.11764018
Ren really everyone who was great in the first movie they're also great here but,0.08565938
I like about the movie is his deeper tones and its themes and the message,0.043243546
about heroes and people in general I really like that definitely enjoyable it's positive you,0.0669902
should go see it this movie has moments of greatness like character moments that I'm,0.08083069
going to remember this movie also has judgment calls that leave me feeling underwhelmed and,0.074294634
unfulfilled and it's all about how much the frustrating things frustrate you did they frustrate,0.15385124
you as much as they frustrated me I'm gonna do the responsible thing here as,0.2960276
I feel this movie is a two time wash before I write it up not,0.08073265
giving a rating yet because giving a rating ultimately would be unfair to both of,0.07494291
us this is why this review was so nlgger vague that if I give a,0.31089434
rating now for you guys you'll be like you gave that rating but you didn't,0.09706101
give a good reason as to why I got that rating the things you love,0.07458232
the things you hated where it why does it stand there so you'll feel cheated,0.30744576
and unfulfilled I just think in a world where YouTube's like a ruins got to,0.15493155
get it up now did you see your feet at 9 a.m. this morning 9,0.15535778
a.m. Tuesday morning yeah that nlgger went nlgger bananas because we all of us YouTube,0.4500752
people like we got to get the reviews up right when the embargo lifts so,0.050382636
we all do it at the same time we all have to mad scramble I,0.19288346
feel like I haven't processed this movie enough to actually write it up so I,0.058616467
feel like the responsible thing to do we just hold off on the writing let,0.07498735
you know how I view the movie on my initial run-through that's done yes here,0.12993659
we are neither of us benefit from a rating today so if I'm going to,0.070770845
write this movie I will write it in my spoiler video which I will upload,0.16373958
