school are still getting into college they realize this and they decide that on the,0.07594848
eve of their graduation it's time to cram four years of partying in the one,0.11993635
night film was truly one of the big surprises of South by Southwest and easily,0.045422852
one of my true favorites of South by Southwest all in general waiting to do,0.061236296
a review on this film until it got closer to release they due to the,0.07911004
fact that I really want you guys to have this film stuck in your membrane,0.2471152
and not forgotten smart is an instant classic and I actually think ten years from,0.2503004
now we will be calling this the Dazed and Confused of our time even though,0.12422196
it does have a lot of similarities to super bad just with girls it's a,0.27632472
meld of both these films put together but also with its own twists and turns,0.15193847
with inside of it due to Olivia Wilde's directorial debut on this film she directed,0.211777
this film it was her directorial debut and it's a fantastic one out of all,0.15142813
the films i saw at South by Southwest this is probably one of the strongest,0.10513577
directorial efforts that I did see it's energetic it's fast paced but she captured a,0.05992213
lot of the great things that made me go back and think about high school,0.09934259
a lot of the things that very much anyone can relate to because one of,0.020649636
the things that she dived in and focused on in this film wasn't the raunchiness,0.14575575
or the humor of it all but in fact it was the relationship between our,0.04219282
two main characters there are multiple scenes in here where it dives into their relationship,0.06007324
and touches on that friendship that I never thought the film would actually dive in,0.07634776
deep into but Olivia Wilde decided to tackle into that with a brilliant script but,0.10785546
the direction is what elevates that relationship to a whole nother level you know what,0.18105927
else elevates it out to a whole nother level is the performances in deeper and,0.10039404
beany failed scene have some of the best chemistry that I've seen truly in a,0.121655434
film and so long it got to the point where I truly forgot I was,0.05852773
even watching a movie it truly felt like I was there with them watching their,0.09382578
friendship develop overall this one night and all the insanity goes through actually one scene,0.115349256
in here that is pretty much one of the top 10 best moments of 2019,0.061248433
in film and cinema in general it is a moment that I'm not gonna get,0.049979005
heavily detailed into but it is just it's a scene that if you've seen the,0.08870448
film it happens at a party and Olivia Wilde decided to take out all the,0.16812022
audio and just go back and forth on the two girls talking and discussing and,0.31089434
the emotion that's pouring out of their face and their facial emotions is what got,0.28408924
the film striked the strongest and it very much dive deep into my membranous is,0.08166008
stuck there for the rest of the days yeah I'm like I said you will,0.11625174
know what that scene is if you've seen the film or when you do see,0.06272554
the film it is one of the most powerful moments in the whole entire movie,0.05607331
and one of the things that I really appreciate about book-smart it doesn't just go,0.10758593
for that raunchy comedy it isn't just a raunchy humorous to it there is a,0.10193814
lot of emotion to it there is a lot of care taken into this film,0.09901391
and that's what really dived me into because comedies in fact if they're making me,0.10288801
laugh I'm all for it but when they have a really good story and really,0.06248801
good characters to it as well that even elevates the film to another level even,0.068883225
when I try to compare it to both these two it's not fair because this,0.07028257
film is completely different to be honest you know what I'm saying that I'm comparing,0.15176658
it to these two films I would even go as far to say they're probably,0.27054384
better made films than both of these did you carry the same kind of dynamics,0.11553821
between them when I looked in say that it's kind of like Dazed and Confused,0.09495948
but just ten years later a lot of these cast members in this film are,0.071285315
absolutely phenomenal but I look in ten years down the road these are our new,0.10702356
stars that we're gonna be looking forward to and you looking back at Dazed and,0.06705628
Confused when you go back and we watch it you're like oh my god I,0.12972434
forgot Ben Affleck Milla Jovovich and even Matthew McConaughey are in this film and I,0.1471997
think we're gonna say the same thing about this I say it's kind of like,0.07435206
this film just with girls you look at it from the perspective of it's like,0.13331878
Michael Cera and Jonah Hill's friendship in here their relationship is very much tested but,0.05800321
I think book-smart tackled and delved into that a little bit stronger it's fantastic humor,0.15718192
all the way around and performances that are off the charts great I mean I,0.11719197
mentioned Kaitlyn Dever she's great beanie fill teens excellent Schuyler jazz Ando who I think,0.27060828
is a big standout in this film as well from all these different cast members,0.07786864
in here Jason Sudeikis has a very hilarious moment in here as well but truly,0.09775716
one of the big standouts of this film that I cannot wait to see what,0.12668063
she does next and I've been saying this every time I see her in a,0.113061324
film or TV show that is Billie lourd she stole a every single moment in,0.30972654
this whole entire film and every time she's on screen I was dying of laughter,0.15235956
I got ton I got an ab workout from this film and that's what a,0.102985896
great comedy does look smart is one of the best films of this year it's,0.14415336
a great directorial debut from Olivia Wilde it's energetic it's fast paced and it's contained,0.10018736
but she knew what she was going for and I just fell in love with,0.10253739
that whole aspect of the entire film I think it's again a great directorial debut,0.06437532
a great territorial effort and I can't wait to see what Olivia Wilde does next,0.13635649
some excellent performances throughout the whole entire film great script all tightly wounded into there,0.0781579
and I cannot wait to see what this whole cast does next I mean again,0.1524169
at South by Southwest they brought the whole cast out and watching them onstage getting,0.11337991
interviewed I just fell in love they're all gonna be stars and this film is,0.05285097
a star in its own with all that said I'm gonna get book smart and,0.12114248
