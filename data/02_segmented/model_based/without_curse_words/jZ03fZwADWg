"All right, the favorite, not my favorite"
"Hey, what's up, guys? My name is Steph Koza and today I am reviewing the favorite"
"So the favor destructed by Y Argo slant the most I could 100% be pronouncing that incorrectly, But he did the killing of a sacred deer, the lobster dog tooth, and he's like a pretty well respected director like he's done some good stuff"
"This movie also stars Olivia Colman, I'm a stone, Rachel Weisz"
"And if you watch the trailer, you will 100% realize that this is Oscar Bait To the nines"
Like 100 percent Oscar Bait movie
"It's set in early eighteenth-century England, till about the Queen and her slaves and rich white people, and Parliament, Parliament, Parliament"
"So you know Oscar bait? No, I have no problem with that"
I enjoy Oscar movies
"Obviously they win awards for reasons, but there are often times some of them to come out, and you're just like this was just created for the Academy and nobody else, But basically it's about the Queen of England, who has this very close friend, Lady Sarah, and she kind of runs things for the Queen"
"The Queen is just sort of like a figure, and her friend Sarah basically governs the country in her stead"
"Then Emma Stones character Abigail comes into the picture as a servant, and the Queen begins to really like her, and Abigail kind of tries to win her over"
"So it's Abigail and Lady Sarah kind of competing to be the favorite of the Queen, And like it's interesting, There are some great scenes"
"There are some really great moments, some really funny moments"
"This movie was surprisingly funny, and Emma Stone is of course wonderful, and completely blew me away, And I would not be surprised if she got an award for this movie"
"Sam goes for Rachel Weisz, who plays Lady Sarah"
"She was fantastic and Olivia Colman who was the Queen and 100% stole the show Like she just embodied that like, kind of disgusting, sort of stupid queen figurehead who doesn't really do anything and just like eats all day long"
She was very complex
"Very interesting to watch, and I, I did enjoyed that part"
"Like the characters I enjoyed, I loved watching them interact with each other"
They had a lot of very interesting unique scenes
But I did not really like this movie
You take out a couple of the good moments
"and like, yeah, I had fun watching those, but as a whole I did not like this movie"
"It was very, very long"
or at least it felt super long
It was also very boring
like In between those good moments were huge stretches of just like really boring
"Talk about the English government, and like literally just Parliament, Parliament, Parliament"
"This part of it that I was like, I don't care about what you're saying"
It's so boring
"Also, I know, I just said I liked all of the characters, but I'm gonna take that back"
I enjoyed the complexity of the characters
I did not like the characters
"Like when I watch a movie, This could just be a personal preference, but I like to have a character to like root for"
like
I want to be on someone's side
I want to like cheer someone on Like that's what I want to do when I watch a movie
I need someone to lead the way for me
This movie is just a movie about terrible disgusting people And you like think you like one of them and then I'll turn around and do something ridiculous and I'm like What is wrong with you? I don't want to watch this movie anymore
"It's just a bunch of, and I get it like Okay"
"It has a lot of merit and like, as a film critic, it's beautifully shot and the music is lovely and the acting is great, but it's just boring"
It didn't enjoy this movie
It didn't make any sense
"I have no idea what the purpose of this film was, other than to be like, Look at these really rich, annoying fat white people"
I think the cinematography was a little bit pretentious
"It was like, also kind of weird"
There's a lot of like fisheye wide-angle like really distorted wide-angle lenses
And I know it's like they're trying to make these like people feel very alone in this huge mansion
"And like I get it, it's all about like isolation, and I get the metaphor, but it just looked like a Sum 41 music video from like 1993, And I was not about it, just a very disorienting upsetting film and I don't ever want to watch it again"
"It was also one of those movies where it's like Yeah, No wonder everyone hates white people"
Do you see everyone in this movie sucks
They're all a bunch of
but one tell that really gives away
The fact that I did not enjoy this movie is when it ended
"First of all, it ends very like abruptly, and very weirdly like the whole movie"
Up until the end is like you could follow it like it's fine
It's a movie and then there's just like this weird weird scene and I don't
it was supposed to mean something
"I'm sure if I like sat down and like truly analyzed it, maybe I would figure it out, but like I don't want to, because I don't care, But it was just very weird and then it just ends and I was just sitting there looking up at the screen"
"I was just like What, just verbally just screaming at the screen"
What? And I'm not alone Because there were a lot of people in my theater and every single one of them also said what they were
all
Just like
What? What? what? what? what? What? Just what just happened
Do you know? Is anybody know what just happened? Sometimes movies like that are fun
This time
it wasn't because I didn't really care
Sorry
there's someone in my roof blowing leaves and a whole bunch of leaves just fell in front of my window and I got really scared
We didn't know what it was
That's a fun sound
Okay
I'm just gonna try and wrap up this video before all these weird sounds keep happening again
"Uh, yeah, the favorite"
not my favorite
"If you liked it, that's fine"
Let me know in the comments why you liked it
I would love to hear your wonderful analysis of this great movie and I'm sure it's gonna win a whole bunch of awards
"Like the costume design was beautiful, the music was beautiful"
"the acting was wonderful, like everything was great"
Also definitely just kind of like
100 percent
"Forget, this movie even exists in like a month from now, and not even recall what it is"
It's one of those movies
"so yeah, I'm gonna give the favorite a 2 out of 5"
Lincoln had good stuff in it
It just wasn't good
I didn't like it
"I'm sorry, not a fan"
So there you have it
There's my review of the favorite
Thanks for watching this video
"Seriously, Let me know if you like this"
"I really would love to hear someone defend this movie and like, tell me why it's good, Because clearly people think it's good and it's been nominated for a lot of things"
I just don't ever want to watch it again
That's it for this video
Thank you guys so much for watching
"I'm stuffed, Koza and I will see you in my next video"
Bye
