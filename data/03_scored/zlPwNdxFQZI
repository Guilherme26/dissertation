to listen to the soundtrack on for over a year it felt like I'd crossed,0.08035788
over into a circle of hell just during a preview before this movie hey that,0.44599563
movie chick here and today reviewing Koko and apparently also Olaf's frozen adventure I mean,0.30115825
fine the Olaf Shore is harmless it's stuffed with more songs than quest for Camelot,0.114639364
but harmless nonetheless just kind of wish it wasn't in front of the movie I,0.12496928
was about to watch although it did make it all the more apparent how good,0.069749005
Coco is it's a surprisingly dark and gothic yet heartwarming and sweet tale about what,0.11904131
it is to diverge on a different path separated from everyone else but to never,0.053113773
forget about those who have loved you and stood by you the title even symbolizes,0.073102824
to never take for granted or discard the memories of those who have passed on,0.06509965
and to never turn away those who still remain with you the story Falls Miguel,0.14537132
a young kid who dreams of being musician much to the chagrin of his family,0.13134658
who believed music had cursed them all and will only bring misery and shame to,0.82913226
their lineage desperate to prove himself as a true musician at a local competition Miguel,0.09653664
steals a guitar from the grave of famed singer ernesto de la cruz however in,0.31089434
a weird twist of fate miguel cruises himself to the afterlife now he must receive,0.15512827
a blessing from his family to re-enter the land of the living before the Sun,0.10773616
sets and he's stuck there for eternity the cast here is great there's not like,0.14996108
one bad apple in the bunch the kid who even plays Miguel usually when I,0.20619583
see this in a kid's movie they're whiny and bratty and very self-centered and just,0.7122891
kind of are rude to everyone but in this movie he's so sweet and good-natured,0.31089434
and he just wants to be himself and to love music and his family at,0.035096627
the same time he's a hopeless dreamer who feels in the end conflicted with the,0.20925044
strong wishes of his very controlling family especially the stubborn matriarch Abuelita if the movie,0.29535937
wanted me to hate her with every fiber of my being then mission accomplished oh,0.6364068
my god she was dreadful all her blind heating music because she was told to,0.36850962
and never fully understanding why or even questioning it just killed me I understand having,0.44736138
a strong sense of tradition and loyalty for your family but when you are asked,0.037148554
to enforce something so ludicrous you just got open your eyes you know my final,0.6330819
straw was when she destroyed something not only held dearly to Miguel's heart but something,0.21877912
that he made himself I legit almost cried when I saw the grief-stricken look on,0.11431368
Miguel's face it was more traumatic than the King Triton scene from the Little Mermaid,0.117700554
now most of this movie is spent in the afterlife and that's where the amazing,0.0990894
imagery comes in that had left me absolutely awestruck the attention to detail the use,0.09077156
of colour just simply gorgeous this is where we meet the rest of Miguel's family,0.09372226
who have been long since deceased mainly we focus on mama Imelda where the family,0.22440967
curse originated from at first I thought she was gonna come off as a black,0.768091
character and merely just an obstacle for Miguel to face but really you end up,0.09880435
sympathizing her and really understanding how she came to hate music and that's the great,0.31089434
thing about this film the longer this film goes on more and more layers are,0.0682433
added you'll learn a lot about the characters and nothing is ever simply painted as,0.03894366
black and white and not everyone is as they seem Hector the Forgotten ghost and,0.25101995
he's definitely one of my favorites here at first he appears to be a trickster,0.53490317
and very roguish but really by the end I'm like crying tears of joy to,0.12844077
this guy it has revealed very very gradually how different he actually is and how,0.15097302
much heart he has you end up really feeling for him in his dilemma also,0.10499102
I still can't believe that Benjamin Bratt was in this movie he plays the deceased,0.15485638
singer de la Cruz even though it wasn't his voice singing all the parts I,0.42531326
was still thoroughly impressed that I couldn't recognize him speaking of singing the songs are,0.09096484
not too bad either and that's coming from someone who's not a huge fan of,0.13100019
musicals for one the songs feel out of place and they had a purpose and,0.07215233
meaning behind them they weren't just merely cluck and when you learn the true meaning,0.19407654
behind the lyrics towards the end it just ends up becoming even more heartwarming and,0.06017365
this film definitely gets you a little bit misty-eyed especially by the end I found,0.34559542
myself caring for the characters and rooting for them there's also a pretty good twist,0.039609
for a kids movie that I didn't really see coming at first that happens in,0.09447852
the third act there's actually quite a few fresh twists and turns in the story,0.03733168
that kind of makes it difficult to thoroughly discuss without giving anything away and I,0.0784942
really would prefer not to give anything away for this movie I really think that,0.092008926
people should support it and go out and see it although can I say I,0.15103178
was not expecting this movie to be as dark and open about death as it,0.39033788
was they did not hold back and I applaud them for that I think it's,0.08058956
important to show children the meaning of death and that it is not something to,0.15160665
fear and that it is simply a part of life and it doesn't mean that,0.07024439
someone is gone because your memories of them still exist also there was a lot,0.16504623
of skeletal mat dismemberment in this movie til like a very gory degree if there,0.15282327
were blood it kind of gave looked like a Tim Burton - style to it,0.31089434
but without being as bleak and sarcastic oh and can I say the dog Dante,0.15185781
it all he did was make me miss my dog more who still back in,0.18023133
Jersey I wasn't able to take him with me on my trip he is currently,0.27025062
living with my parents and he's basically Dante just - the really long tongue I,0.10331175
kind of made me wish I had a another dog right now my place isn't,0.13356598
allowed pets so my only real complaint is the end they tie up the loose,0.18178952
ends a little too neatly and most of them off-screen also there was no retribution,0.08309366
for how cruel Miguel's grandmother was to him like she did some awful things to,0.31089434
him and they just kind of brush it off and it's I realized that's kind,0.15225714
of realistic especially with this type of family but I don't know I was kind,0.102183945
of hoping like to see some sort of groveling I mean I'm sorry I I,0.3593047
know there's tough love but then there's also being a stubborn asshat regardless I really,0.85679233
dug this movie I went through so many emotions my heart and throat felt sore,0.15089653
from trying not to cry during this film it probably didn't help that I am,0.089981966
spending my first Thanksgiving without my family so watching this movie really brought out those,0.08220465
fields however this movie did teach me it's okay to follow your dreams like I,0.24161677
did moving here to California as long as you never forget your family and those,0.12251598
who love you this is a genuine family film with a bit of a gothic,0.094271414
side and showcases a beautiful culture that should be taught and embraced by all ages,0.0979186
and yes well it has a similar premise to book of life it shares a,0.06415024
bare-bones likeness at best and sorry to say but Coco did it better in my,0.15363158
