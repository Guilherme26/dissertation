what is up guys do here,0.11566688
and this weekend I went out and saw Lulu Wang's affair well which is,0.05940887
finally out here on UK screens it's been a little while as usual a good film comes out in the US,0.12525755
everyone goes a little bit nuts for it gets low as it buzz and we just sort of sat there waiting waiting on our little British arses,0.8060606
but before we get into the juiciness of today's review,0.075072445
I wouldn't be a youtuber if I didn't ask you to subscribe,0.08509191
so if we can do that for me right now cheers mate,0.044926442
now that's out the way I guess we can talk about some films film singular,0.073762864
it's only one film,0.09206585
it's the farewell,0.06165215
so as I said it starts by Loulou Wang I've not seen any of her work before as far as I'm aware this is like her second feature film and essentially it's sort of based on real-life events that have happened to her and her family premise of this one being is a family in China's,0.055605512
grandma finds out she has cancer or rather the family find out but don't want to tell her because and I had absolutely no idea,0.18920071
this was a custom in China but apparently it's seen as a bad thing to tell someone of that age that they're going to die they just rather let them live their life to the fullest until they absolutely have to know,0.22959134
so you have this weird kind of fake wedding they have to set up to get her to come and see them home it's an interesting premise,0.28154764
and it leads to a very interesting film I was a big big fan of this one it starts awkwafina in the lead role here,0.067538925
and I mean she crushes it she really does I've not seen a whole lot of Aquafina x' work,0.10564981
I think I saw her last in ocean's 8,0.15987422
and then a couple of supporting roles here and there and so I'm not too well-versed on Aquafina as an actress but she really did a good job here,0.10662016
it's a sort of performance which works best because it's not going for all these crazy big moments,0.43432522
there's no huge breakdowns or anything,0.10034038
I hate saying it,0.4423922
but it's a very real performance which is the strongest compliment I reckon you can give to a performance in a film like this,0.0838392
because ultimately it needs to feel real to work,0.060860846
and it does,0.03807706
so yeah aquafina did a great job,0.14848551
and the rest of the cast of the great job as well and it's also a testament to the writing of Lulu,0.050292052
Wang here who also writes as well as directs and the biggest compliment I can give to the film is it a hundred percent feels like I'm watching a real family interact the relationships on screen unfolding in exactly the same way,0.07732204
I'd expect a real family's relationship to unfold and that makes it just incredibly interesting and engaging to watch it's always fun watching characters interact on screen it just feels like the normal way characters wouldn't it doesn't feel like a very flashy out-there screenplay and doesn't need that it's not going for that I have to give special props to the Nana in this film,0.0649466
I think I kind of fell in love with her and I would like her to be my own Nana in real life,0.189179
I want her to read me stories at bedtime goddamnit she's adorable and you immediately sort of fall in love with her which in itself makes the whole rest of the film just work because I can't help but feel like this film would have fallen a little bit flat,0.63207334
if you were thinking that grandma's a but the concept of the film this whole idea that they don't want to tell the grandmother that she's dying so they have to come up with this,0.09244882
fabricated wedding to get away with getting everyone they know together to say goodbye to her,0.16538699
it's a really really interesting one and it works really well in the film it's naturally kind of bittersweet premise in itself and you can see how immediately that narrative lends itself quite well to being almost kind of farcical with a lot of laugh,0.25471884
and humor there and you can understand how it's inevitably going to start hitting the fan and you're gonna start getting a little bit teary,0.42589146
I did both of it for me,0.07464133
I found it to be funny when it needs to be I also found it to be incredibly poignant and quite moving when it needs to be as well,0.09935654
and I think it comes down to the fact that even though we're watching a Chinese family and it's set in China for the most part and it's talking about Chinese customs,0.14530562
and traditions,0.0529679
the characters are written well enough and the relationships are real enough to feel like you can relate to almost,0.032050163
anyone in this family because a granted depending on life experiences in age I'm sure there's not one person here that hasn't ever worried about,0.10244732
some of the love passing away,0.12166891
let alone had to go through some of their love passing away,0.17773353
I don't feel like it's a bit of a cop-out to criticize this film for not ever being as amazing as other people making out to be but I do feel like there are certain moments which could have landed better,0.10432743
there are certain aspects of it which I maybe wrongly was expecting to be a little bit more,0.13850886
I don't know flooring,0.13382904
I guess it's probably not the right word at all a certain moments,0.078672156
I think could have been executed a little better and being a little bit more effective,0.56531054
for that one of those being the ending,0.13983425
I really liked the ending I thought it was a really strong ending and actually sort of that the bit leading up to the ending,0.22615413
I thought was really really well done I was crying so it did something right,0.11520486
but the very very ending of this film left me in two minds,0.1528821
don't go into too many details cuz,0.13901056
I don't wanna spoil anything about the film,0.1511239
but one half of me thinks yeah it's really sweet the other half of me thinks kinda a little bit cheesy a little bit obvious but I've said it before and I'll say it again,0.18002735
I don't really have a huge problem with cheese,0.08666954
I guess if it worked it worked and and Who am I they didn't work because I had tears streaming down my face if it had cut maybe a tiny bit earlier and and not showing us a little bit more I think it would have been more beneficial,0.31859276
for that I'll leave it at that it's a really really solid film a laughed I cried enjoyed watching these characters on screen consider me a loo doing fan now I'm totally on board for wherever she ends up doing in the future and I will be there watching your next film also Aquafina,0.07892304
