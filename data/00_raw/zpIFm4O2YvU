what's up guys welcome to found flakes on this inning explained I'll be looking at the new alien film arrival not to be confused with the mid-90s powerhouse the arrival starring Charlie Sheen this has nothing to do with that and despite this movie featuring Lois Lane and Hawkeye teaming up to deal with aliens there are no giant aliens with laser cannons or anything like that bummer a rival is kind of like the antithesis of the Independence Day sequel whereas that was an overblown spectacle this movie is a much more subdued dramatic take on humanity's first contact with alien life so there's a huge question at the core of this movie why are they here it's even right there on the poster so we'll answer that but in addition to the ending itself there is a theme throughout the movie that helps explain the movies concepts further and gives a better grasp of what the ending means I'll get to that as well so let's get going shall we our story begins introducing linguist teacher dr. banks and her daughter Hannah we see several scenes as Hannah grows up to be a teenager and then unfortunately succumbs to cancer these appear to all be in flashback and take place before the main story we also get our first clue to the core of their idea with Amy's daughter's name Hannah her name is a palindrome which means it said the same four words as well as backwards in a sense there is no beginning or end as both ways are correct now we catch up with dr. banks in present day where during a class the world is shocked to learn that 12 shell-like spaceships have descended from the sky and planted themselves at random locations around the globe a few days pass as everyone anxiously awaits to find out what the ships are doing here are they here to attack or to help colonel weber then enlist banks to help them decode the alien language playing our tape of strange noises heard from the aliens so at this point the government already has been able to communicate in some form with the aliens but they can't translate the sounds and they need dr. banks along with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly to help them understand what the aliens are actually telling them every 18 hours an area at the bottom of the ship opens up allowing the team to temporarily access inside the vessel and interact directly with the aliens the aliens are known as hepta pods due to their seven tendrils or legs they kind of look like a hand cross with an octopus and the way they tend to communicate is via inky circles shot from the end of their tendrils a majority of the movie is dedicated to the team learning more about how to communicate with the aliens on each and understanding more about their intentions along the way they do have two languages via the sounds they make and the circles but most of the focus again is on the circles the way their language works is within each circular shape they form there are distinct patterns and shapes and each of these has a related meaning in our language like this one here might mean technology this one weapon and this one cetera we are also told their language is nonlinear which is well represented by the circles they create again there is no beginning or into a circle just an infinite loop independent of the linear structure of our own language and as dr. banks understands more of the aliens language she starts having more and more of what are essentially visions of her deceased daughter and what we don't see Hannah's father there is mention of him being a scientist hmm wonder who the father is let's look at the cast here [ __ ] government guy don't think so Forest Whitaker no that's a white baby what about Ritter well yeah obviously since he's the only scientist with any lines in the movie but how is that possible if they haven't even met each other before the arrival guess we don't have that one figured out quite yet once they're able to communicate back and forth more successfully they translate a message that seems to indicate that the aliens are here to give them a gift or perhaps weapon of some kind now fearing an attack from the aliens the government sends our team home and now it's up to the military to sort out these alien buggers but dr. banks isn't willing to give up yet and has another interaction with the alien now revealing their purpose for coming to our planet essentially in three thousand years they need humanity's help and in order for us to help we have to understand their language as you learn more of their language your brain is essentially rewired and once you can totally understand their language you unlock its true power which is the ability to travel through time yep that is one powerful language but this isn't time-travel in the traditional sense this is all mentally so the traveling seems to be more of her accessing visions from a sort of unconscious astral plane of time which now upon understanding the language she is allowed to see also potentially her brain rewiring has unlocked a dormant part of her mind allowing her access to these future visions and now that dr. banks fully understands the language she is even able to manipulate the ink herself to make words she has now fully tapped into the time travel abilities from their language with almost no time remaining before China launches its offensive on their respective ship dr. banks flashes to herself at a gala she runs into the military leader of China general Shang the man who has his finger on the trigger back in present day he says to her he is appreciative for what she's done and knew that he could trust her when she told him what she did on the phone his wife's dying words which he now whispers into her ear cut back to present time and dr. banks is able to use this information to call The Dictator and get him to stand down from his attack saving the ships from destruction so that scene at the gala and in fact all of the scenes that appeared to be flashbacks are actually taking place in the future after the events of the arrival so Louisa in the future got the last words of the dictators wife which she's able to use in the past to stop him from attacking but how does she get to that point in the future without already having the information in the past well that's because this is one of those pesky time travelling paradoxes but also because of the way time travel is treated in the movie there is an explanation in this case as we've seen throughout the film there is the concept of the circle or that things are the same forwards as well as backwards and even their language itself is nonlinear so that to me means that even if something is happening in the future time is an eternal circle so the concept of the future or the past is meaningless time to them is handled in a totally different way conceptually that it would be normally considered to us puny humans so that's why it might seem like a paradox but in this case there is an explanation for how it can still make sense it's also interesting because the aliens even knowing about the future threat is another paradox due to the power of their language they are aware that the threat is impending and have to go through this process in our present time to teach their language to humans as they're doing what they are supposed to do in order to make the events in the future happen but how do they know in the present about the future just like with the general it's all due to the circular nature of how they consider time and not really a paradox in this universe the other side of their version of time-travel is nothing can be changed things are always going to happen in one way no matter what we do this is applied directly to dr. banks and our unborn in the present daughter she is already aware of exactly what is going to happen to Hana dying at an early age so now she knows about it but again has no control over this inevitability though she does choose to appreciate the time she has rather than dwelling on the depressing outcome which is quite noble of her and without sounding too sappy a pretty powerful overall message what you have because it won't last forever it's also clear now that dr. banks is special in the sense that she is the only one that can first unlock the languages code the aliens already know this due to their powers that she is the one that will translate the code in the present leading to teaching the others and helping them in the future and even before dr. banks meets the aliens she is already having future visions of her daughter and they are sort of subtly guiding her on the path to further understanding their language and now the ships have left our planet dr. banks and Rin er will go on to have Hannah unfortunately Ritter does eventually leave before the child's death I have a feeling that dr. banks eventually revealed she knew what was going to happen to their daughter the whole time and didn't share it with him until way later down the line it's a pretty miserable way for things to turn out honestly one thing I really am curious about though at the end dr. banks publishes a book about the aliens language so now everyone around the world can understand it too but does that mean that everyone would be able to access the same time travel ability of dr. banks I'm not really sure but it does seem to be the direction they're implying so apparently the entire human race needs to understand their language for that threat coming thousands of years in the future we don't know what the threat is exactly but it is still bizarre to consider everyone around the world fluttering in and out of different time periods in their life all the time there you go folks the quite confusing ending of arrival explained whatever time-travel is on the table it's always going to get complicated but what did you guys think of arrival any other lingering questions you have that I missed and if there's any other movie endings you want me to explain let me know in the comments below thanks for watching found flicks see you next time
