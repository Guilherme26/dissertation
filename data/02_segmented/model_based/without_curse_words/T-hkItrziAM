"Let's do this, so the last Jedi picks up right after the events of the Force Awakens, Rey is seeking out Luke Skywalker in hopes that he can train her and return to help save the resistance"
"Meanwhile, the First Order is attempting to end the resistance once and for all, And that's all I'm gonna say about the plot and the setup, because this is a spoiler free review and I will be putting out a spoiler full review on Sunday"
"with that, said The Last Jedi was good, but it left me with so many mixed feelings Now before I dive into my full thoughts, Be sure to put your thoughts down below in the comment section"
"Tell me what you liked what you hated about it, but avoid spoilers In the comment section On this particular video also stick around to the end of this video to learn how you might be able to appear in one of my future videos"
"Using the start of staff with that said, Let's start talking about the best things about this movie"
"The best thing about this film is it's a character based film where each of the characters have a journey thereon of discovery, and there's a great performance backing that journey that they are on"
"This might be the best we've ever seen Mark Hamill in this role, and maybe ever in his entire acting career"
Carrie Fisher gives another amazing performance
It just has such sadness in the character as she's seeing the world around her as she's fighting for hope
"once again, Daisy Ridley is charming as she's ever been"
Has met
all these characters seem to be pretty charming and likable
"In these roles, Brian Johnson brings possibly the most unique and distinct directorial style that we've seen in any Star Wars movie Thus far With angles"
"He uses the look of it, and this is a gorgeous looking movie"
The action is shot with wide angles
You can see what's happening in the lightsaber battles
"There's little distinct things, and our space battles and our land battles that just give them a unique look"
And that's all Ryan Johnson's action
And this is a movie that avoids the tendency of most sequels to just go bigger
"Better, bigger equals better"
it doesn't do that
"And while the stakes are more dire than ever, and you feel the danger of everything happening, it's not because they're just making everything bigger"
"Whereas in previous Star Wars movies, planets what star systems are destroyed, there are death stars and Star Killer bases"
This movie doesn't escalate stakes by just going bigger and makes it more personal and it's directed in such a way that you actually fear that something bad could happen throughout the whole movie
You just feel like the resistance could fall apart at any time
Our good guys could turn to the dark side at any point in time
It
"in that regard, it's very much like Empire Strikes Back, in that the story's not gigantic, but it's personal and it matters"
"in that regard, it's very much like Empire Strikes Back, because the scope is smaller"
"It's more personal, but for some reason the stakes seems so much greater than they did before"
"From there, let's move on to the parts that I had mixed feelings about this film constantly goes against your expectations, and then at the movies very unpredictable"
but it feels like it's unpredictable for the purpose of being unpredictable for the sake of being unpredictable
"In that regard, Sometimes it feels hollow like moments will happen where you think there's gonna be substance to it"
Something really unpredictable happens and you don't feel the emotional weight that you should feel there
The audience had a reaction like
"Oh, That was shocking, but you didn't feel substance to it"
"It just felt like they were actively trying to go against whatever you thought was gonna happen or what could have happened, just to make sure that the movie was unpredictable, and in that I appreciated that it didn't play into what we expected or what we wanted"
"Then who took twists and turns, but at the same time they didn't pay off the way I felt like they should have"
The film also plays a good bit of homage to the Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi
Now what it doesn't do is use those films as a template like the Force Awakens did
But there was a lot of stuff that felt a little bit too familiar
"Some of them was good, perhaps, and some of it felt a little bit too much like Okay, We have to have an element like this from one of these two movies and you could just feel where scenes were going because it was playing so much homage to previous films"
Also the humor in this movie was a little bit mixed
"Certainly, I laughed out loud"
It added a levity to a movie that had a lot of weight to it and a lot of Arcanist to it
But the jokes didn't land as well as they did in the Force Awakens
"A lot more of them felt forced, some of them felt like they were callbacks to the previous movie"
It was like I don't think we need to do this
I'm cringing a little bit at how much you're trying to be Jj Abrams type
Funny
"speaking of Jj Abrams, some of the mystery box type stuff that was set up in the previous film, This movie doesn't embarrass itself by trying to give answers that don't work"
But it feels like it kind of shifts away and avoids answering some of those questions
"And so is the level, pretty mixed bag on a lot of different things"
With this move It wasn't like I hate this
It's not that loo
That's really bad
"It was just kind of like Okay, That doesn't fully work as well as I think it should have, and with that said, from there, let's move on to the worst aspects of this film and by far the worst thing about this movie is a plotline involving Finn that just feels unnecessary"
Now
"In one sense, it is necessary because it kind of links together a few plot points in it"
but you feel throughout the whole thing like ooh
you could have found a much smoother way to do this without having this gigantic rabbit trail
"That's the least interesting thing about this movie like every time that we go off to cutaway to this other adventure, you're thinking, man, I wish I was back with Luke and Rey"
"Man, I wish it was with Kylo, Ren right now, and it's not interesting"
"Even the the design of the world where things kind of take place, and the characters there is some of the most bland stuff in any Star Wars movie ever"
You're just like
"Wow, this feels so La"
"and possibly because of this subplot, this movie is way too long for the type of story that's being told"
"I mean, the movie has a fairly straightforward narrative"
"In the movies, the longest Star Wars movie that's ever been put out, and that's because you've got a few too many subplots going on and some of them are way too long and unnecessary for the type of movie that's being told here, and you feel that weight as the movie goes along, and since so much stuff is going on, it feels like the movie takes a long time to get started, and while the stakes of the movie give a sense of urgency to it, the environments and shots are used make the movie feel like it's not moving forward like there's several points in time where there's establishing shots that feel like"
Haven't we seen this exact establishing shot four or five times already? as it cuts back and forth between the three kind of plot lines that are going on
"Also, the script frequently uses miscommunication or bad communication as a way to kind of move the story forward and create conflict, but the end result is feeling a little bit like if people had just communicated information that they could have communicated, you could have avoided big, gigantic, dire consequences, And that's not really addressed within the movie"
"And so it kind of popped out to me like shouldn't that have been addressed? or should we come up with a better reason that they didn't have certain information? So overall, this is a movie that I did enjoy"
"I do think it's a good movie, but it is a movie that leaves you with all kinds of feelings that are all over the place"
that kind of demands additional viewings
and for that reason I'm not gonna put my rating in the movie just yet
I'll put a rating on my spoiler review that I'm gonna put out on Sunday
"I have a pretty good idea where it's landing amongst all of the Star Wars movies, but it's giving a score to it so that you guys will hold me to in the future"
"I want to hold off just a little bit until I have a second viewing, and if I'm being honest, you need to go see this movie"
It is a Star Wars movie
It is a good Star Wars movie
"It's not one of the best Star Wars movies, but it's a solid addition to the franchise"
"Then we'll definitely elicit a response from you, and in my case, I need to see it a second time before I can fully decide how I want to score this one"
So those are my initial thoughts on the movie
Here's what some of you guys are saying about it
This was fantastic
"I mean everything, the tension, the suspense, the humor"
"If I'm being completely honest, after one viewing, I'm slightly underwhelmed and don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but for me it just felt like a series of really great moments that never quite came together to form a cohesive story"
In a word
Last Jedi is unpredictable
"Um, I loved it"
Definitely go out and see it this weekend as soon as you can
Whoa

I loved every minute of this movie
This movie went in completely different directions than what I was expecting
