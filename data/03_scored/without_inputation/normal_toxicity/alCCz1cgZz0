I'll check it out,0.061354306
you know two hours and fifteen phases three-hour movies smooth is fantastic,0.19189978
it's absolutely fantastic where do I start I don't really know where I can start,0.07816004
it's just a great film all the way across the board the performances are mesmerizing,0.07969194
and why I say they're mesmerizing is just how what I love about these films from the 70s is that these movies are so free from vanity or star type of acting like,0.15008342
it's really just actors up there living and breathing the characters,0.16806643
these are real people James Caan is Sonny Al Pacino is,0.1003866
Michael Marlon,0.079264365
Brando is the Godfather,0.090891115
you know what I mean they are these people in this movie when tired Shire is giving into it with her with her abusive husband that woman is losing her mind,0.4441428
for real that ain't no acting,0.08677424
that is the real deal,0.060371246
in this petition like I will say when I get into the business professionally and I become a fully working professional actor and do films this is the type of level I'm talking about like I'm talking about getting up there living it for real in front of the camera I ain't talking about no you know I'm gonna hey I'm gonna come to the store see you later type of acting no or no or Bill Russell Miami by season 2 style acting,0.0926271
when you say the words on the paper,0.1488705
no no I'm talking about living and breathing the characters in that moment where I'm feeling it we're in it,0.07801434
we are in the moment great great great stuff,0.047789235
there's there's so many anything is I had never seen the film,0.05719317
but now I see where all the movies all the gangster movies have stolen,0.27043465
from this film,0.10105957
you know that the famous quote,0.057338696
I'm gonna give him an offer,0.098732755
I can't refuse in a you know Marlon Brando would you come to me come for,0.2152764
now one thing,0.069932975
I will say about Marlon Brando when I was in acting classes back in the beginning of my college career,0.07946221
one of my acting teachers moves like a Broadway guy from New York kind of thing um his opinion of marlon brando was not the greatest because he was an actor or stage,0.16224726
actor he didn't feel Marlon Brando was as exceptional as everybody else thought he would he also had a couple knocks on Kevin Costner where he said he did they Kevin customer was a good actor I'm not getting it all that but I'm just giving you guys opinions of like people who are tourists stage,0.104115605
actors,0.060476456
versus,0.07488881
you know people who are like actually stars character actors or whatever you get different opinions,0.10697918
I also remember digressive also back,0.055420734
I think was 2002 or 2001 a filmed Antwone Fisher in Cleveland I went up for extra work on that movie I never got a call back which is fine 19 to 20 men but either way I knew a woman who worked on that movie and she was an actress local stage actress in the Cleveland area and I know that she had some scene - Denzel all I know is direct quote from her life this ain't me this is,0.07022149
her she said well we was just making him look good take it as,0.14939359
you,0.10154687
may I don't know if that's being bitter or,0.11734603
whatever that's what the person,0.094595015
said so you have different opinions,0.0907076
upon you know people who are stage actors and how they feel about movie stars and their,0.12249285
acting hey,0.036672093
look my opinion is somebody who loves to act and loves to perform and loves,0.088816136
films I can only go off how I feel and what I see and what I get from the actual,0.106361896
performer you know I would be a part of all,0.09263444
this you know this person is bad and that person is,0.4890013
bad although we all have our,0.15301634
opinions,0.049626563
but whatever but anyway back to the Godfather this does exist the kind of acting you see in this movie you just you just don't see anymore,0.13533786
you just go it's just pretty much non-existent unless you watch like some movie some independent David Lynch movie streamed on online or something like that that's the only time you get to see this kind of acting the cinematography,0.15463027
and this thing also stolen years later with that very kind of I saw the net that Joaquin Phoenix movie we own the night words,0.15969455
it's very kind of muted kind of brown kind of tones and kind of a brown kind of look she almost and hit my car because I asked him know how to drive,0.6059828
hi sorry oh um but he's very muted kind of brown kind of colors or gritty kind of look you also saw that movie the yard with Mark Wahlberg walking for you to remember,0.15228087
I think it's the same director but I really love the cinematography but I and I see how all the gangster kind of movies have stolen from this movie,0.24086243
and of course again I love how the camera scenes take their time,0.13452867
that's the difference with the 70s movies the scenes take the time with the when the camera sits there you feel like you're in the room with them observing real people it's not like now we're like cut cut to close-up angle,0.16348094
you know there's a little bit of that in there but it doesn't feel,0.104447186
so choppy it doesn't feel like the movie is forcing you to pay attention to certain things that they want you to see the movie really just feels like it's sitting there in the room and you as the viewer make the choice of who your eyes who you're going to look at you might be looking at everybody,0.08541683
your eyes could be drawn to certain people in the room,0.41014028
70s movies give you the option of picking who you're going to observe in this room of people while you're watching observing what's happening in front of you are they just on beneath and scenes take they take their time,0.15110978
they say no rush,0.087082475
we don't have to be rushed,0.15291563
we take our time take our time,0.08046917
now yes,0.051385034
all these movies this the deer hunter taxi driver tons of movies from this air that are very very long,0.064304024
I think the big difference being is just everything that I just stated with an observer real life does not go as quickly as we want it to when we apply for that branding job you'll get that callback when we want to it could be six or seven it could be months before we get a callback it could be months before we get approved for our house whatever this is real time,0.06900734
that's how it goes,0.050154407
you know it's not like this new filmmaking where hey I applied for a job,0.12852873
and I get the job tomorrow no no,0.08178377
no,0.06626663
this is happening,0.06774679
I'm with them,0.058444813
as this happens when I went out I'm with Al Pacino over in Sicily,0.09776959
and I'm just observing all of this and I do love that scene where his wife in Sicily just gets blown up,0.54671407
that was the funniest thing where I love how he's like he's like hey man,0.19211233
what you doing,0.077281736
I thought,0.03942445
she's supposed to be helping out my wife in the car he's like where you going,0.2614958
this guy back,0.13359846
I mean my man took off in the car was like boom,0.15003648
that was the best I love that see it was the best it never has a firebombing been so funny in the movie I'm sorry I loved that scene but this is just great now um a criticism criticism I Marlon Brando okay I understand that this is an iconic performance I get that and I do get a little butthurt when people talk about movies that I grew up with and I love I did not grow up with The Godfather this film came out way before I was born but I knew of it my entire life Marlon Brando's performance to me is slightly excuse me slightly hammy slightly slightly I'm not knocking it but it only seems to get hammy when he kind of I think there's like a scene where like the guy who is the singer is talking about how he can't get this role in the movie and he wants them to do some pool for him,0.18921825
so he could get him a job in the movie and he goes like we're crying,0.18073153
he kind of made fun of them there those kind of moments where he kind of go over exerts,0.17747551
I kind of feel he's hammy but when he really just Marlon Brenda just chills and acts,0.1894646
he just goes like oh I think he's very good,0.11155062
I really like the scene oh that's his real life son but where he scares the kid with the teeth before,0.27785492
he has a heart attack,0.38307407
I really like that team I really like a lot of things between him and James Caan and I think there's the one in particular that sets off the war between the different families,0.117966495
but we're the guys like Caleb wants you to get in on this drug trade with me and you know Marlon Brando's like I'm going to no you do what you do I'm not really feeling that James Collin kind of jumps,0.23969363
in I really like that scene I thought there was a really good dynamic of highlight the father is kind of more like you chill,0.10739939
you don't be disrespectful,0.33053148
you know you don't let another man know what you're thinking you just chill be like,0.14874919
no,0.06626663
I'm good you do,0.0990705
what you do,0.07365151
I do what I do,0.06724793
and James Caan is just kind of like nah man I'm not feeling this dude at all but I like how you got that little dynamic there,0.14945747
you can really see that that character of James Caan Sonny was like stolen from a lot of movies you know the you know the Joe Pesci is old dog for menace to society jeremy renner in the town that style character of the off the handle family of friend member has been just stolen a million gangster movies but um,0.31089434
this is just a great movie,0.057025198
and I also love how they show that the women in this world to quote John bender from The Breakfast Club need to shut up and go fix me a turkey potpie stay in your place,0.6327167
you know it's crazy man,0.6626284
I love out of the city the movie with Diane Keaton and Al Pacino,0.09517648
and one thing about Pacino in this movie is he starts out just kind of like an observer of his family's activities but he'll want no part of it and has he and as he grows in the family and becomes you know become the new Godfather,0.070660256
I love how you can see how that infects him,0.20993344
you know he's kind of more starry-eyed and naive at the beginning of the movie and by the end he's just like the rest of them,0.5154597
you know and he's just as cold,0.18506779
and calculating like the rest of them but you have to be in this business,0.15181693
but I love how when Diane Keaton comes to him goes,0.06203066
that's not true,0.05556465
what you did to such and such my man looks right in her face and lies and goes no and she goes,0.59438163
I need you,0.06292943
but the thing I love about the scene is that's the lie of when these women are with men,0.44952244
were part of organized crime,0.22814892
they don't want to believe that the person they love is the fly,0.10835796
they don't want to believe that the person they love is organized crime,0.2511423
so he tells it which she wants to hear no but they both knows BS fantastic scene thumbs up the video subscribe to the channel share the video hit the bell to be notified when I have new videos and leave comments down below about this classic classic classic our update more reviews I see you guys,0.1349253
