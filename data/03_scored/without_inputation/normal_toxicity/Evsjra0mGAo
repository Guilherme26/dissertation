I know it's difficult,0.050422467
but I don't know it's a review of the movie inside out Pixar movie that just came out,0.10089296

I enjoyed the movie just not as much,0.09065549
as I um thought I would I thought it was a good movie just not as good as I thought it would be heard a lot about it,0.09678016
a lot of people seem to like it,0.10613182
and I thought I would too but I don't know I just gone to a couple reasons,0.15199111
why I'm having this conflict with it with with the movie why may not have enjoyed as much as I did the first reason is um,0.08265973
I don't know it was sort of like watching my own private struggles played out on the screen um you know this battle between sadness and joy um and just trying to see you know who went out um,0.053578284
and then there was just like little parts where they kept talking about this memory where she missed the goal and everybody came and chilled her up and that was a happy memory,0.11843772
and I kept like the whole time he talked about it thinking you know why wouldn't she be sad about that also um which I guess led into the overall lesson of the movie that you know sadness can be bring joy and really the story of um moving from you know childlike emotion to more complex emotions and things growing and expanding and um,0.0938648
yeah just watching all that i know i just had conflicted emotions about it um and you know I I guess it was a huge movie talking about Kayla motion,0.1140865
and I'm sure to pass that and it's just something that I know I guess we all struggle with it,0.074403904
and I just I don't know I had issue with it I didn't have issue with it just I find it distracting,0.0661882
it's probably the best um way to describe it,0.05783235
I found it distracting um the other thing that I knew a cop,0.08681321
I kind of had issue,0.143867
with was that the emotions were sort of in complete control that Riley didn't really seem to have any say,0.05735687
and what she was doing it was just all the emotions at the controls directing everything it,0.06281311
maybe it was something that i missed something I didn't quite understand,0.081556335
but I just I didn't see like her as an individual propelling anything it was just always doing the emotions and then um,0.15313525
I don't know maybe I was trying to reach much into it um and I mean I've heard really good things,0.112213336
I've come from the movie I heard a story on NPR where some kid had trouble jumping off the high dive for his class and then one day he when he did it and they congratulate them asking how I did he said that um that he thought that fear had been in control for too long and that he decided but that just to meet goes into saying that you know that we as individuals have a little bit more control her emotions that our emotions how controlling us and again it made me something that I'm miss reading that I'm not understanding um,0.08053912
maybe it's something that comes with complex emotions,0.0781464
I don't know that's the basic review go ahead with the movie it's a good movie,0.07904772
I encourage everybody to go and see it um nothing I will say is I think it might be cool,0.08030291
if they do a sequel to the movie and instead of just luring growing up or something like that they do somebody with a mental illness and how you know out of control their emotions can be or I don't know be something to explore although it never happened,0.29862812
so yeah if you see tell me what you think,0.08214721
and if you haven't seen it I encourage you to go see it love peace,0.08918131
we do my is my my,0.0646971
