II and let me let me like specify this movie is very very very nlgger,0.3604372
weird um like when I saw this I I I honestly don't know how mainstream,0.18838783
audiences are going to react to this because like in the trailer trailers there's a,0.06836017
lot of action but like they have touched on none of the weirdness like this,0.13748471
movie has some weird disturbing kind of gross nlgger in it and it's awesome I,0.44600078
love it it's fantastic if you love mad max you're gonna love it but like,0.2583272
I don't know mainstream audiences can get on board for like the amount of like,0.059244487
weird crazy nlgger um you got Nicholas Hoult who plays knucks who's kind of one,0.7337272

it is just one long action scene the cinematography and this is beautiful beautifully beautifully,0.06333137
shot and what like compliments like the just beautifully shot film is the fact that,0.25851858
almost I'm gonna say like ninety percent of this movie is practical effects a lot,0.106117666
of the color yes color has been corrected so when you look at that you,0.12754026
like yes that's not natural but like that's pretty much it all the exploding cars,0.13531183
the flipping cards the crashing cars the stunts it's all real um it is and,0.09943367
it is just wild it is absolutely wild the stuff that they do in this,0.13283795
movie it is unlike anything I hope this movie makes a shitload of money so,0.6047076
they can make a sequel because George Miller said he already has a sequel written,0.15551923
and it's ready to go if this is profitable which oh it is great it,0.09654677

the main character um max is in it but Tom Hardy as Mad Max he's,0.27434716
great he maybe has 20 lines of dialogue the entire movie he does not say,0.0773125
anything at all he's just kind of there and he's good and he's grunting and,0.15405628
