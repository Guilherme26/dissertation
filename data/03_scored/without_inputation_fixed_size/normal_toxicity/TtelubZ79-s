brain brain brain brain hi my drain I'm a black bear with a review for,0.69542736
yeah the reviews inside out I'm gonna give you the good I'm gonna give you,0.15743494
the bat I'm a give me the nerdy remember that 90's television show Herman's head,0.35242507
on Fox you ever thought yourself what if like years later they made that a,0.13275886
cartoon best synopsis ever first the good Pixar has had a couple of rough patches,0.11406401
we usually have seen them as the studio that made quality movies but a couple,0.022728996
we were like yeah inside out I am happy to say is one of the,0.10661396
good ones it is a really good movie and what really helps this film are,0.07310839
the emotions themselves they're really good characters and what's great about them is they could,0.06783766
have easily been OneNote one-dimensional characters but they aren't they definitely display their specific emotion,0.0684578
their specific characteristic but they have moments that go against that characteristic sometimes they are,0.08461207
able to be fully fleshed out characters inside the brain of this little girl riley,0.5568915
particularly sadness like you're just thinking she's gonna be a sad sack the whole time,0.4262439
but about the end of this movie i swear to you you will be in,0.23845313
love with sadness she's just a great great character Phyllis Smith puts a dynamite performance,0.14508334
on that character and easily one of the greatest characters in this movie but everyone,0.061701223
does a great job in is Amy Poehler perfect choice for joy Mindy Kaling the,0.030749435
perfect choice for the disgust Bill Hader perfect judge my fear it was black her,0.6364068
choice for anger it's like they really nailed down the right actors to play the,0.14876483
parts of these emotions I also love the creativity in this movie of how they,0.19964497
show you how Riley's brain works how memories are stored how she has core idea,0.40336168
that she is interested in and those turned into these islands what happens to her,0.10668939
memories how they get lost all the different types of things that happen when your,0.11332768
brain they put some kind of creative spin of how it works through the animation,0.1508664
or through the storytelling and it's just phenomenal the movie is not a laugh riot,0.066319205
but when it does humor it's actually good humor and what's nice about this movie,0.070569105
is that it has the jokes that the kids are gonna enjoy but it has,0.07893443
a lot of like really so humor because it's talking about the brain is talking,0.35100877
about neuroscience there's different kinds of jokes and references that it makes to that sort,0.056286957
of subject matter that adults are probably gonna get more than kids so I always,0.096081346
love it when a family movie has those kind of layers but you know for,0.10537938
every comedy when it comes to Pixar you gotta bring those pigs are tears man,0.5950614
there's certain parts of the movies gonna make you a little sad make you cry,0.15533188
there's gonna be one particular character which they don't really show on the trailer so,0.040301036
I'm not gonna say what it is or who it is but there's a character,0.09829878
that you'll meet along the way in this movie and you're gonna be like okay,0.15010409
this is like a cool character oh he's bringing some humor to it it's kind,0.085880175
of funny and the way they switch it on you you better watch this movie,0.117459364
in 3d and cover your eyes and glasses because it's Gumby it's gonna be some,0.19317307
Pixar tears man a little lamp and like so make everybody cry I talked about,0.32285938
another Disney movie earlier this summer that came out and said that this heart was,0.06414335
in the right place with its moral but it just kind of told you more,0.08388929
than showed you this movie doesn't complete opposite the moral of the story they want,0.09584528
to tell you but you take away from this thing which i think is a,0.15469855
very important message they show it in the movie through its storytelling they do it,0.0616693
through very quintessential important scenes that show exactly what they're trying to showcase to you,0.08026525
if they make it crystal clear what they're trying to convey it's gonna be hard,0.07318661
to say some bad about it not necessarily bad just more like something you shouldn't,0.100259796
know like I said this movie does have some jokes but it is not a,0.05414241
beginning to finish laugh riot and the only reason why I said that is because,0.10539329
when you see names like Amy Poehler Bill Hader Lewis Black Mindy Kaling pills from,0.06834363
the office when you see all these names you're gonna be like oh man there's,0.08507338
gonna be the funniest movie ever comedians particularly improv comedians they're able to bring these,0.16358842
little quirks and nuances and different parts of the character so again not make them,0.15078984
one-dimensional since their emotions so just know that going in there will be funny moments,0.05658771
there definitely be some parts will to make you laugh out loud but just so,0.07252969
you know they're picked more for the characters that they can convey out of these,0.06350745
emotions not necessarily because of the quote unquote comedy and again while they do have,0.06363004
a lot of jokes in here that are gonna be for adults this is definitely,0.058757376
a story aimed for the younger set you could sorta see this movie as an,0.07960237
introduction to how your emotions are and how they work and how to deal with,0.09983178
them therefore there's gonna be a couple of times it is definitely gonna be aimed,0.100174665
towards younger people but at the same time still enjoyable and I know they only,0.10165037
want to have the core emotions in here but it would have been nice to,0.058523946
see a few more emotions even if just in cameos this movie kind of sets,0.0793127
itself up for a possible sequel and given what they would have to go to,0.09466454
next with the sequel which would make perfect sense I could see that sequel possibly,0.14472137
popping out a couple more emotions that we would get in an inside out too,0.14177778
so maybe that will happen enough of the nerdy most of the time you are,0.3882134
in Riley's brain but there are certain points in the movie particularly during the Critias,0.31089434
at the end so at least watch the first part of the credits where we,0.06019444
get to see the emotions inside the brains of other people and that's funny it's,0.36271405
some of the funniest parts in this movie that's a really good jokes in there,0.09451398
and I hope again if they make a sequel to this that's something that they,0.116476886
play around with in the second one and make sure you get there early because,0.07748352
before the movie you're actually gonna get a pixar short called lava and let me,0.26996595
just say at the end of it you're gonna want to hug a volcano don't,0.08101473
hug an active volcano about that would probably kill you this is a very good,0.5943938
quality movie that's imaginative that's creative and it has a lot of heart and definitely,0.03598795
one of the best films to take your family to it's gonna give you some,0.19290502
joy and it's gonna give you some sadness and the only anger disgust or fear,0.25365436
that's gonna come from this movie is dizzy and Pixar looking at the box office,0.1021589
to see if it'll be Jurassic world and if Jurassic world beats it they're gonna,0.09731378
be very angry and very disgusted let me know if you are planning on seeing,0.23634118
inside out and if you have so you don't let me know what you think,0.18336959
of it and make sure you're subscribed to black dirt comedy so you can see,0.6364068
all my movie reviews as well as other videos I love you like to play,0.07480671
