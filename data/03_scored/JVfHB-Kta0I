the film where I also want to address the release date of this movie so,0.05421955
I know a lot of people for those of you who don't know the August,0.20887965
season is kind of the end of the blockbuster season so blockbuster season ends tour,0.029838389
ends in July and always they're kind of like the films where their studios are,0.090943
testing out working kind of go either way it could be a good movie or,0.07463466
it can be a bad movie and so it's like a paper like why is,0.1537338
this movie coming out during August like doesn't mean it's not good but I want,0.08762246
to educate people let them know that movie has some significance to the timing of,0.07360748
this release date it comes out during the leaking of where the Charlottesville is that,0.06443213
it happened from last year and so I just wanted to let people know for,0.03243674
those of you who might not have known of many of you may have already,0.33792847
know just to give you a little background on the median and the significance behind,0.104255386
this film and the timing of its release so let's get into the review yeah,0.058501296
so I have to say that I really enjoyed this film first of all I,0.07888178
was watching this am I just like damn way I got just enough - I,0.4033488
was talking to two different people that like different times like they voices sound exactly,0.098902576
the same like yeah I don't think nothing was up like I'm trying to figure,0.10158654
out what shall work routing process if I will see where I can take that,0.05336127
much to get in the Ku Klux Klan but I'm just trying to figure out,0.15170687
how to jog it who boozled okay so when they stand out for me would,0.33899793
have to be John David Washington and also Topher Grace I'm so John Neville Washington,0.038128998
many of you who may know he is a son of Denzel one of the,0.19189963
greatest actors ever and he also um is in the TV show ballers which is,0.08793055
one of my favorites and is coming back on Sunday yeah so um he was,0.05700858
very entertaining playing Ron stallworth and so one of the favorite things he's very charismatic,0.11755736
on screen he's very funny how he says the work oh wait why I can't,0.07369869
even say how he says it but even when I saw in a trailer just,0.071747
like how does he say why won't they like quite why kind of like I'm,0.09053153
like I don't know I'm just but you know one of the things that I,0.10385202
will have to say outside of it talking about racism and one of the themes,0.23894727
that had explored with his character was how being a black man and being a,0.06213307
cop like how hard something like that will be in either something that many people,0.12534225
go through today and I thought it was a very important topic to touch upon,0.15030278
I'm just because it is exploring his viewpoint as being a black man and seeing,0.403137
how african-americans are treated in America and him trying to fight for the cause but,0.4927019
also to him wanting to inflict change from within by being a detective by making,0.15405594
sure that he can kind of train change the perceptions of people by working on,0.117427796
the others but how they could be stressful and how it can also be trying,0.056737583
because many of those who you are trying to give a voice to give the,0.058562748
voice to the voiceless they now they feel like you've betrayed your own race because,0.35483184
you are working for the same people who inflict pain upon us so I thought,0.24128862
it was very interesting for them to touch upon that and kind of show a,0.106774114
different viewpoint of what a black man will deal with while being a man in,0.5782181
uniform and so also - I think what Spike Lee does a well here is,0.064268574
he talks about a very heavy and just a heavy topic and many will say,0.17536418
that is a divisive topic about racism and how even exploring racism through the Ku,0.24261723
Klux Klan and back in that time and kind of shown the parallels of how,0.2906628
we're dealing with the same things in today's society I think that he does a,0.06485277
very good job on educating both sides and giving a material that is kind of,0.06428318
is heavy but due to the comedy of the film of the satire in the,0.11055097
film it kind of eases you into kind of that viewpoint or talking about that,0.27119416
topic of racism I was laughing and then like in the middle me black because,0.53826886
I was just like yo this is things stuff that be happening but it's funny,0.0615607
because they're like making fun of it then I'm like damn but this is I,0.6068961
really happening and there's a scene in the film where I kind of talked about,0.058839772
like they would this would never happen I'm like bread but it's happening right now,0.10761213
sorry both laugh and then I was shook cuz I was like whoa why is,0.118910156
this happening right now just can't even believe this but I think that audiences will,0.079579294
really appreciate how Spike Lee decides to tell this story through the satire but also,0.0840102
putting in real reminisce and showing history through through movies through the organizations like the,0.1032489
Ku Klux Klan and how some of these things that we may take lightly or,0.25923207
may not even think of the effect that it had dealing with racism like how,0.31089434
that is prevalent today and kind of how racism has evolved into a political landscape,0.24013864
and so I would say Topher Grace is the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux,0.15176378
Klan he was a second to me I'm just in this portrayal and his relationship,0.15554063
or on stallworth the conversations that they had it's just crazy because you're laughing cuz,0.32175988
you're just like this is so little Prince but people really think this way and,0.2724626
the fact that this is a true story like the whole time I just like,0.035699688
yeah I can't even believe that this is true story man all this craziness happened,0.34562448
and so it shows even through Adam drivers character Flip Zimmerman who is Jews man,0.3548699
who was playing Ryan Sauber it's in person when he was meeting with the Ku,0.064835295
Klux Klan because obviously the real rocks are worth Kengo typical of his scheme but,0.31089434
yeah so even showing his progression and how he never really paid attention to racism,0.34205353
but being in this type of society in his organization and seeing how they act,0.13999371
in how they infiltrate all parts of society from being cops er just in the,0.31645915
small towns and it's just crazy like watching this an entire film I really think,0.49486074
that everyone did a very great job with the material that was given to them,0.050104145
now I will say there's a little bit of a peace an issue with this,0.107956745
film it's a little bit over two hours and at some point I could really,0.08257723
feel that it was two hours but for a majority of the entire film it,0.073262595
was still entertaining and enjoying for me what I love is towards the end of,0.08224121
the film how Spike Lee he takes you on this journey through satire and retelling,0.14911763
this true story but then at the end he kind of ties you or kind,0.058146052
of brings you back into your reality because the whole purpose of the movies are,0.0951466
kind of to escape into a different world but how he chooses to tie this,0.09157076
in and bring the audience back to the reality of what we're dealing with today,0.0284865
in today's society I thought it was brilliant it was amazing I got emotional torture,0.44834277
in the film I'm not gonna spoil it for how he did that but I,0.0754335
really enjoyed this film I think Spike Lee did a very very drive I think,0.12787528
that audiences are gonna enjoy this film I think the timing for this film is,0.049934406
perfect and I think this is going to be a huge success and this is,0.029286334
really going to kind of happen a lot of people been saying like Spike Lee,0.1445772
bit off lately but he backed out even though he didn't really be back okay,0.22316302
so for me for my Klansmen I would have to say that you paid to,0.18170248
see this film in theaters I thought it was amazing I absolutely loved it I,0.07417089
would encourage everyone to go support this movie to watch this movie and to learn,0.12314007
from this movie so as always those are my thoughts on black Klansmen my name,0.30465373
is Shauna from Peter wayton if you liked what you saw today make sure you,0.08004109
