what's up guys it's well back again and today's view is the fantasy drama film,0.28194353
the shape of water co-written and directed by Guillermo del Toro the shape of water,0.08377762
takes place in the 1960s and primarily follows Sally Hawkins character Eliza Esposito Eliza works,0.076565415
as a janitor at a Research Center in Baltimore and begins interacting with the strange,0.03380998
creature that's being studied by medical professionals at the research center as time passes Eliza,0.11614705
finds herself at odds with the scientists and government officials as she begins getting attached,0.10168639
to the creature and the rest of the film spent watching their friendship evolve as,0.07971397
the government attempts to simply understand what this animal was alright so I can't exactly,0.19337574
say I was looking forward to the shape of water I mean I definitely wanted,0.07127573
to see it because it's guillermo del toro but it wasn't something that I was,0.08478152
like dying to see you know like when the trailers came out I was interested,0.18161163
in it I wasn't blown away by what I saw in those trailers I didn't,0.060595833
feel like I had to rush out and see it but like I said since,0.05767316
Guillermo del Toro's name was attached to it I felt like I kind of had,0.061538443
to see it and I saw the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes like I said don't,0.152064
I don't ever read reviews beforehand but I do look at scores a lot of,0.05446991
times because you know I don't get any early access to these movies I see,0.10393888
him most the time the same time do you guys do really I was so,0.08460426
really disappointed with this one I was very disappointed with the shape of water because,0.085145
it feels if I feel like I had no emotion to it I felt no,0.09154049
connection to the characters and it wasn't really entertained it was just kind of a,0.029324442
very boring movie and that's probably gonna be upsetting to a lot of different people,0.20483246
out there who probably loved this film but it was very boring I found myself,0.14312671
checking my my watch on my phone a lot just because I just felt like,0.08295269
there was nothing really happening it felt like I wasn't engaged in the story like,0.051496223
things were progressing but it eventually just kind of felt like a collection of scenes,0.09556444
kind of you know mashed all together into this force kind of awkward romance story,0.17866394
and that's you know it is unique it's a very unique movie and I think,0.083229974
that will resonate with some people this love story it's a very unique very different,0.07911182
type of love story very different type of romance story than what you've probably ever,0.05738338
seen before or at least very different from what you've seen before and that's cool,0.07372652
that Guillermo del Toro took that direction but you still kind of gotta have you,0.24091868
know good character and the story that's actually entertaining and you know makes sense to,0.048709676
me this story doesn't make sense there's a lot of things that happen to feel,0.08384143
very forced like I said it feels like the romance is the biggest part of,0.094787635
the story and they make sure that happens no matter which direction the characters are,0.03173032
going and no matter which direction things are headed and when it comes to the,0.06828272
entertainment factor that's a really really big issue for a movie like this I mean,0.110798046
any movie really I mean there's a lot of things that movies can try to,0.077716574
do they can try to help you learn something help you feel something but entertainment,0.08212372
is the primary focus for a lot of films and this film is not an,0.07507972
exclusion from that and it's not a very entertaining movie like I said I was,0.109141685
very very bored this is by a lot of people considered one of the best,0.046690073
movies of 2017 and for me it's one of the worst because it was so,0.24129193
boring there was like I said there was no engagement no attachment for me it,0.19067346
felt like a very hollow experience very hollow and like I didn't care about anything,0.14407153
I didn't care about the characters I didn't care about anything that was happening that,0.058934998
was going on in this story and that's a big problem because if you're feeling,0.07955013
that way and you're feeling that cold towards the story and towards the characters that's,0.034162745
that speaks volumes for how much you're enjoying the movie because if you're not you're,0.10022257
not engaged in that way you know you're not doing much and it's not like,0.12326585
I'm a huge Guillermo del Toro fan of his that I've seen is actually Pan's,0.09135064
Labyrinth I don't think I've seen any other his films I mean I have to,0.15363243
go down his IMDB page and check but I was more interested in his work,0.25174892
because he has that kind of credibility as a director a lot of people consider,0.14532316
him to be one of the best a lot of people love his work and,0.07286205
love his films and I think expectations were very high for this movie and that,0.135864
maybe that could be why people are judging it so favorably I don't know maybe,0.075730555
they actually enjoyed it this wasn't a movie that when I went out to see,0.08407839
you today that I was going out there and really hyped really excited to see,0.113036685
it sound like I was going to see Star Wars or Avengers or even a,0.049947314
trail that really wowed me like moonlight or lala land last year arrival those movies,0.1146703
were movies I was really excited to see going into the shape of water not,0.093629695
so much I mean like I was going into it expecting it to be good,0.12128828
I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as I thought it was but I,0.10824688
didn't expect it to be great either because I feel like the trailer their story,0.043206625
just didn't act with me I didn't feel any sort of emotion from the trailer,0.07591589
I didn't I felt cold like I did throughout the entire movie and besides a,0.045692872
few scenes I think a lot of the reason or the biggest reason that I,0.09291978
felt so cold was because there's no build up to it there's no build up,0.06393304
tinea scenes things just happen things just happen like so the collection of scenes that,0.082576066
lead to events that are in the script and they have to be there that's,0.05391756
how this feels to me it feels very contrived and that's a big problem for,0.07917344
a movie that's you know supposed to entertain me and supposed to make me my,0.24075764
heart warm basically I'm supposed to have a heart warming to an extent experience from,0.059277724
this because it is a romance story it's a romance story it was sold as,0.052577965
romance story it is it's a very odd one but it is that and that,0.054019358
may be part of the problem too I mean it's a romance story like I,0.056558494
said and the romance is between a sea fish monster and a woman and it,0.4670356
just feels weird it just feels weird and like I can't really connect to the,0.05705681
story no matter how much outcasts they are how abused they've been how neglected they've,0.17605135
been in society or you know wherever this wherever they've been that didn't really change,0.12738371
the fact that I couldn't get invested in their relationship I couldn't get invested in,0.066968866
their evolving relationship and that was something that you know is gonna if you can't,0.05967177
either if you feel like this movie is gonna be too weird for you and,0.16298324
you're not gonna be able to get invested in this unusual romance to say the,0.10997682
least and you're not gonna enjoy this movie I'm guessing a big reason people really,0.17993306
enjoy this film or some of the critics really enjoy of this film is because,0.10839867
of the characters the characters are outcasts almost all of them and they all interact,0.060970325
and identify with each other in unique and outcasts like ways they've all kind of,0.11457449
been shunned by society in some way they all kind of feel unaccepted or unappreciated,0.15240146
in some way and that's something that does resonate throughout this story and that kind,0.054740056
of identifies and goes with the creature that Sally Hawkins character you know has a,0.11936022
romantic connection with because they're similar in that way but it's just it's just weird,0.28188035
I think if you're really into artsy really unique films which I am to an,0.16301729
extent then you probably will enjoy this I think this is very specific to a,0.085922346
very specific crowd very film buff very hardcore movie lovers artsy film lovers those kind,0.12961476
of those kind of crowds that's this movie is going to appeal so and otherwise,0.075003736
if you're not in that crowd I think you won't like it but there are,0.14664643
a few things I liked about this film I mean the shape water does have,0.09360224
some redeeming qualities I mean I think sally hawkins is really great in her role,0.18408054
as Eliza I think she's probably the best thing going for this film I liked,0.09687615
her character the most but I was more impressed by the performance I mean this,0.09589369
is a very difficult role to pull off considering Eliza is a mute she has,0.16525418
to speak through sign language she has to relate a lot of emotion to her,0.073839135
facial expressions and body language and just general tone without actually speaking anything that's a,0.10766667
very tough role to take on very difficult role to take on not a lot,0.09930456
of actresses could do that role and I thought she pulled it off really really,0.08272518
well Michael Shannon is also really great he's great in a different kind of way,0.08746698
he's intense very creepy it's a very Michael Shannon s kind of role I plays,0.30330408
a government official and he's very serious about this asset this creature I thought he,0.25024945
was really great to him and Sally Hawkins were great activity Octavia Spencer was also,0.082860604
really good she was good as well so the acting is good it's just weird,0.3718541
to me that I liked all the performances but I hated all the characters even,0.18112735
the good guys and the bad guys I hate I didn't like either didn't connect,0.13182077
with either of them that's kind of weird that so that's a rarity for me,0.27552408
and I think I can you know most people can separate the difference between a,0.034061465
good performance and a good character or bad performance and a bad character here good,0.11412778
performances bad characters that's kind of how I do it the movie also looks cool,0.13220923
I mean the CGI looks cool there's a lot of really slow-mo shots a lot,0.4031865
of pans and zooms a lot of great cinematography work a lot of interesting lighting,0.14790535
lighting efforts letting work in this film it's a very pleasant very easy film to,0.09479462
look at it has that 1960s vibe and feel and tone to it visually visually,0.051676244
this film looks great a lot of underwater shots that look we're really really cool,0.23966876
very artistic looking it's a very easy film to look at just not a very,0.09139336
easy film to engage with emotionally alright there's one more bad thing I have to,0.18549174
say about the shape of water so the ending the ending is very out there,0.0634293
like the rest of the film but it makes no sense I was very confused,0.06306177
and very frustrated but not surprised because the rest of the movie kind of does,0.10502588
the same thing and it very much left me underwhelm very cold I walked to,0.09377107
that theatre very disappointed that was you know the whole movie kind of felt that,0.10385687
way to me but the ending was just you know the icing on the cake,0.10621578
as for the pros cons though the shape of water had very nice acting performances,0.12509124
from Sally Hawkins Octavia Spencer and Michael Shannon they were all really good and it,0.050580356
looks cool the visual experience is very nice CGI looks cool the cinematography the lighting,0.09085756
all looks very good as for the cons the story was very uninteresting it lacked,0.070165396
emotional resonance and didn't have much of an entertainment factor the pacing was a little,0.05225866
bit of a mess there were a lot of collections of scenes no build-up not,0.14915508
not much tension to experience in this film the ending was very anticlimactic and the,0.101008296
characters as a whole were also very very underwhelming I'm gonna give the shape of,0.14493144
water a 4.5 out of 10 I know that's very disappointing to hear for a,0.10008596
lot of you and I'm gonna recommend that you pass on this one in theaters,0.17928514
you might want to see it if you love Guillermo del Toro and you're just,0.10806663
looking for a very out-there romance story but otherwise for most audience members the vast,0.057023652
majority of you I feel like you could really pass on this one so did,0.07663388
you guys see the shape of water yet what did you think of it and,0.07179686
if not let me know why not and also let me know your favorite gear,0.105766304
mando Toro film I guess mine would be Pan's Labyrinth I don't really have much,0.098030195
of a choice that's all for now though this is wolf Aqsa fication signing off,0.07533464
