hey everybody it is october obviously the month of halloween so i figured i would,0.09280243
review a few horror movies and today i'm going to start with us this film,0.13940254
was it came out in 2019 and it was written and directed by jordan peele,0.042621642
jordan peel had a really fascinating rise to prominence in hollywood he began of course,0.052015364
as a comedian as a writer and an actor in sketch comedy he got a,0.05126437
start more in mad tv and then eventually he rises up the sketch comedy ranks,0.028556334
once he partners with keegan michael key for the sketch comedy show key and peel,0.021830661
and then out of nowhere he makes his directorial debut with get out which i,0.12634498
don't need to tell you was a huge hit and it was widely critically acclaimed,0.16423583
it really touched a nerve with audiences because of how it delved into social commentary,0.031239685
in a way that people weren't used to in mainstream horror commentary on class and,0.05101227
racism and identity but from the point of view of a black man and i,0.57858807
think that's what jordan peele wants to be known for at least for now he,0.035438325
wants to take the idea of horror which is of course an iconic genre for,0.055897377
audiences and then subvert those expectations by giving us an unlikely point of view and,0.038236085
as a result he has a lot of power now he's considered to be one,0.021190755
of the big rising auteurs it's a meteoric rise for sure and i think a,0.08774105
lot of people were just really thrown off they were surprised that some guy that,0.071078196
was known for acting and sketch comedy and writing and stuff like that could suddenly,0.040277533
write this this horror movie but for me i didn't think it was that much,0.064498864
of a stretch because get out is more of a social commentary it's kind of,0.016427375
satirical but it has horror elements but i always saw it more as like a,0.053255934
hority and i always loved his philosophy he always believed that there's a really thin,0.069867566
line between making somebody laugh and and making somebody scared and i think he's absolutely,0.116305366
right they're you know totally different reactions at the end of the spectrum but often,0.013052898
humor can be blind with it you know like humor can be used as a,0.027533947
defense mechanism for fear or sometimes in really tense terrifying moments a strange humor can,0.016636243
come out of it so when they kind of bleed together that's when things get,0.123017736
really interesting especially when you can't differentiate the two that's where the crux of the,0.027818644
horror lies for jordan peele and i think he's wonderful at expressing it if you,0.20513399
watch sketches in key and peel you can absolutely see that element of like eeriness,0.028030839
and horror elements where the humor takes a kind of a sharp turn into unexpected,0.12284944
dark territory i'm thinking personally of course of sketches like megan and andre they're hilarious,0.082754835
but there are major elements of of tragedy and darkness there too like a you,0.04178218
know manipulation and abusive relationships and and megan is a terrifying but realistic villain and,0.091086924
i don't know i felt like get out kind of was an extension of that,0.0613898
just more fully developed and more interesting of course it's one of the few american,0.053764135
mainstream movies in recent memory to be really well structured as in i see almost,0.0245792
no fact to trim the payoffs are clear the arcs are really really strong overall,0.05648806
and there's just something very refreshing about that however when i watched the movie i,0.036588427
liked it but i felt like there was something missing i i felt like okay,0.08701799
this is a good start but i'm very intrigued to see what you're gonna do,0.030676274
next because i felt as strong as the story was there wasn't a real style,0.051050182
and a sense of tone that matched that i wanted something more cinematic so he,0.037148513
follows that up rather quickly with us and you know i think that he it's,0.03420973
kind of a tough thing when you make a movie that starts off so high,0.037019465
you have a lot of expectation behind you how do you recreate a cultural moment,0.08440116
like that can you recreate it to me i think you should just move on,0.09748267
and try to do something different and not get kind of crippled under that expectation,0.060000896
but when i look at us i kind of wonder to myself did he truly,0.026450362
succeed with it i mean i think it depends on how you look at it,0.039126102
i think in some ways yes he did improve on certain aspects of get out,0.056878522
in other ways he didn't we have another horror movie here that is like get,0.039869778
out it's very socially politically aware where it's focusing more on the divide between classes,0.032925926
and like assimilation and trying to discover your identity when it is so attached to,0.029856103
your skin color or rather maybe how your skin color is attached to the environment,0.3211224
you grew up in is maybe a better way to say it conceptually on a,0.06542813
basic level i think us is really intriguing and really interesting i really like the,0.025607575
concept behind the tethered having these doppelgangers these copies of the original person that represent,0.08661423
the lower class and how like the privileges of the rich are always depriving the,0.06088692
poor also that guilt haunts the rich and the privileged and just the idea you,0.10096024
know that like every bite that you take a child somewhere is starving and there's,0.22487265
always that underlying thing that we know but we rarely face the consequences of that,0.030758757
but unfortunately when you have like the upper class and you have like you know,0.08318055
reality the world as it exists on the outside all of that is is fine,0.04277264
it exists as it does but then i look at the world of the tethered,0.03649929
which is of course underground and again i like the concept but i feel like,0.018029803
it doesn't make a lot of logistical sense and it doesn't feel nearly as fully,0.023663908
formed as as as this world up here however stylistically i think this movie is,0.050051745
really cool it's definitely very cinematic compared to get out and there's a lot of,0.038168903
detail in the aesthetic that i appreciate and i just love the color palette it,0.022906264
has this rich almost like aged technicolor quality there was a lot of thought clearly,0.044880606
that went into the mood of the film and how they decide to build the,0.013374847
suspense elements and all of that really captured my attention particularly in the opening sequence,0.024288516
i love when adelaide is on the beach and she's going into the fun house,0.06405053
with the mirrors and you know having the mirrors be that metaphor for that snap,0.034119263
from reality into those metaphors is something that we see a lot and i mean,0.023943951
yes you could say that it is quite cliche but i felt it was really,0.017479695
well directed here and peel seems to be taking a lot of recycled cliches and,0.0973157
again subverting them using familiar tropes but from a different point of view the score,0.01968877
is fabulous and i rarely say that about modern movies today especially modern horror movies,0.071033634
uh and you know has that coral quality to it which is very kind of,0.032648545
spiritual and soulful and haunting but then there's this weird texture and a kind of,0.0826657
an edginess to the instrumentation throughout and i think at times the way that he,0.09921946
explores humor in this movie is really really clever and when everything in his world,0.07148063
just feels a little bit exaggerated it makes everything a little bit more creepy like,0.15086165
david lynch in a lot of ways you know like the tethered they're like these,0.30946293
resurfaced harlequin dolls or something or like clowns from the 1950s out for revenge against,0.122143015
the people who maybe dismissed them lupita young while i don't necessarily think that her,0.18059403
performance here is especially amazing or anything like that i just think she has an,0.13395135
extraordinary face and body that is just pure power and it's very very cinematic she,0.07289814
has just such beautiful skin but these eyes that pop out and really express a,0.08787209
lot of emotion and that is perfect for the horror genre but as the tethered,0.030866517
version of herself or whatever you want to say there she does a fantastic job,0.046494342
her eyes are bugging out and she is so terrifying and everything is very accented,0.23982663
where it's right on the edge and you don't know what she's going to do,0.059938367
at any moment that feral quality to her movements is very interesting and she's she's,0.11832154
got a great physicality and clearly she's a very good dancer and it's really brilliant,0.09541195
to watch i think really that's lucid and young's strength a lot of times is,0.015736915
her physicality and the voice she uses you know it's it's like this feels like,0.08754881
it's croaking she's trying to croak her dialogue and there's a real tragedy to that,0.04279459
she's fighting and there's a pain to it but also this vengeful nature to it,0.30902806
as well it's very over the top it feels like like i like to say,0.050693646
a lot of times right on the edge of farce like kabuki theater or something,0.12531728
yet it thrives in this particular world in the same way that you know like,0.024652371
jack torrance thrives in in the shining in kubrick's universe elizabeth moss is the highlight,0.10574026
for me but she she always is i just love her i i enjoyed that,0.07656929
aspect of the movie having this small insight into another family the white family's point,0.15830772
of view how adelaide or lupita younggo's husband in the movie is you know he,0.043879505
wants to be the man this paternal force he's trying to provide for his family,0.025244385
yet he feels this competition to have all the nice things like you know elizabeth,0.034880236
moss's family and i enjoy that aspect of assimilation that's where it really comes out,0.02494239
and connecting the families based on that but when you look at elizabeth moss and,0.021184104
her family do they seem happy at all no they seem much less connected than,0.105035156
adelaide's family they all seem to hate each other they're and their their privilege has,0.30884013
made them weak and distant and just ungrateful they think they're above little inconveniences but,0.16161768
i really like moss also as her tethered version of herself i really don't know,0.20075841
how to how to say that but you know what i mean it's really really,0.026374532
creepy i like it because it is a twisted version of the real version of,0.153847
herself and all the elements of that come out in the conversation at the beginning,0.0362718
of the movie when they're on the beach where she's having that discussion with adelaide,0.036160048
she talked about all the things that she wished for had she wanted to be,0.07337441
an actress but then she ended up getting married and having kids and she's just,0.06703056
bitter about the life that she chose she's one of those women who feels like,0.13342986
oh the best years are behind me like she's some sort of like tennessee williams,0.082247294
southern heroine there's a line where she says she got plastic surgery and she says,0.0867007
to adelaide oh no but you you don't need plastic surgery and you know maybe,0.03734075
there's a little bit of jealousy there because you know lupita nyong'o is kind of,0.10253074
a like a one-of-a-kind beauty that jealousy that we saw in get out is kind,0.07911894
of resurfacing here i think but i think it all comes out through the very,0.04345179
distorted tether version of her and how she is still theatrical where she's literally a,0.12378935
laugh away from a tear and that might be one of the most haunting images,0.06489598
in the movie for me she goes over to cut adelaide you know with the,0.036940973
scissors and she has the taste and she just can't do it and then she,0.11399651
goes over and does it to herself i'll awesome sort of like black dahlia thing,0.22072522
and i love it i love it and i guess i just really find that,0.016586354
interesting just like the bridge between the doppelgangers and their personality traits their their subconscious,0.21933833
but the whole threat of the unconscious mind for all of us is that we're,0.100761354
afraid that you know certain toxic angry aspects of ourselves are are going to take,0.073514104
over the parts of us that are more healthy and balanced and here all of,0.017337346
that is represented through the metaphor of just anarchy and and the idea that class,0.034361392
separation is becoming wider and wider between the rich and the poor based on the,0.053641073
powers that be and the real threat is the people who are experiencing that and,0.05871177
are images of the tethered and how they're standing and they're ready and they're holding,0.04377374
hands as though it is some sort of protest that's really powerful and yet when,0.011132513
you look closer it just doesn't like i said before it doesn't make logical sense,0.047068395
especially in the third act the reveal of this experiment that's gone awry is just,0.024954364
it's it's half baked unfortunately i love the look of it it reminded me a,0.044982377
lot of the third act of i'm thinking of ending things just this idea of,0.09861015
of uh this weird sort of surrealistic void where the self-actualization is going to take,0.11860091
place the melding of two aspects of consciousness finding the whole in this case it,0.020922687
would be adelaide and then the tethered version of her when there is the switch,0.055000044
which is of course you know like the big twist of the movie where we,0.023649273
realized that the real adelaide is the one that got switched and then her tethered,0.045519847
version is the one living among us why would she feel the need to mimic,0.081671245
what's happening above when she's the real person that wasn't really explained why is the,0.021003174
mirroring happening at certain times and then not at others so i think this is,0.037127227
something that maybe maybe peel thought about in his mind but it just doesn't really,0.024058362
translate is he trying to infer something and maybe i'm just i'm just not getting,0.030547895
it or is he is this more kind of a lazy way to create a,0.07754977
plot convenience and don't get me wrong i love the twist i really do i,0.045018964
think it's absolutely fantastic i think it's absolutely tragic in concept but it doesn't work,0.037218355
fully when you think about again the logic behind everything and therefore it loses a,0.04266355
bit of its power so it feels like just kind of a device that's used,0.043964647
more as a specific twist to change the story up in a way naturally i'm,0.021697626
less logic driven just as a person just that's how my mind works and so,0.02827496
i'm a big believer most times of suspension of disbelief in movies but when you,0.04551918
have a world like this that depends so much on logic and how your underground,0.045428716
counterpart is is feeling the repercussions of things and how it's all connected i i,0.04247796
think you really need to be kind of clear about that world the world building,0.1054509
that way the payoff that big twist at the end could be fully realized and,0.02944635
be opened up because as it stands the twist doesn't take us in any interesting,0.08299563
direction it just kind of solidifies the point about you know what it means to,0.021089647
you know have to break a few eggs to make an omelette and it's really,0.18227562
frustrating because there's so much here that i really enjoy and that i'm naturally just,0.10008021
just drawn to and i i do think this could have been great i think,0.049530905
it could have been as good as get out i think it could have been,0.059437484
better than get out but key aspects of it crumble under just the whole nonsensicalness,0.024372328
of what's going on here overall i still like it i do think it's a,0.05581423
cool movie i think it's an entertaining movie i think it's got style and it's,0.0939512
got passion and it's trying to say something more i love peel's world i love,0.067862034
the tone of it and i'm excited to see what he can pull out of,0.05927518
it whether he you know explores more in the horror genre or whatever so while,0.033416167
it is very uneven i still think it's worth your time i definitely do recommend,0.07671563
it but i will say that same year parasite came out and i think if,0.2124244
you want to watch a movie that really takes the ideas of class struggle and,0.04671319
like privileged guilt and lack thereof and and the vengeance of the lower class watch,0.123774715
parasite it takes those ideas in a much more clever direction and it's just a,0.19751896
stronger stronger more fully realized film but get out is a really fun movie especially,0.04091478
for halloween but that is my review thank you guys so much for watching i,0.032862734
