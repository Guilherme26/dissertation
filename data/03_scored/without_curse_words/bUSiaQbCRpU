these you're gonna get four because there's part for tight let's talk about the directing,0.09833945
/ visuals this film is directed by Josh Cooley and I have to say his,0.085356966
directing style mixed in with these visual was on point probably the best visually looking,0.07251508
choice stories I've ever seen hands down do to 2019 this is keeping one honey,0.08023786
we're not a ninety five but this film just looked so good the CG was,0.10410977
just phenomenal the movement was crisp the the colors were popping it was very vibrant,0.092443
it just looked that damn good and shout out to you Josh because you did,0.7093121
a good job directing this movie and I really appreciate it the way you directed,0.13260405
it you you did your best to make the Oder audience feel what the younger,0.05883745
audience is about to feel you know I mean we're older now I was there,0.036685616
95 baby you don't say it and for me to come in and still get,0.18686616
some of that direction where it feels familiar I like that and I appreciate you,0.04737884
for doing that the visuals on point it's Toy Story for baby Oh point let's,0.09986185
talk about the music Randy Newman came back to do the music for tour story,0.06869354
for and I have to say with the much up respect for any look me,0.0840929
because no one could do it like this clearly I will go say no more,0.10317976
no one could do that like when you Norman Newman but this music was whack,0.39681068
in this film did not care for him at all in this movie he was,0.10921735
a shell of what that in 95 was it just did not feel organic new,0.10007263
vibrant it felt like let's throw him in to make people feel like the old-school,0.40315565
Toy Story and that's what the much up respect no disrespect to him at all,0.14890413
but it was just like shut up I'm done this music does not this film,0.45267144
does not deserve Randy Newman in this at all it's not a Randy Newman type,0.21303664
of movie it just did not feel right it felt forced it was like alright,0.10848588
we get it we get it you want to bring up a familiar voice music-wise,0.07633859
to this to the story I did I understand it but wrong movie for this,0.07717345
music I just I was like honey shut up goddang stop singing I felt like,0.520453
Family Guy on apocalypse episode y'all know back then it was like stop it huh,0.18425773
gosh freak alright let's talk about the story let's talk about the script story this,0.3068605
story was created by eight individuals yes eight people had their hands in the cookie,0.11401541
jar and it felt like eight people had their hands in the cookie jar this,0.1493071
was a terrible disrespectful spit in the face story and the reason why because it,0.5154597
felt like these eight individuals didn't know where they were going and why they were,0.08261851
doing it and what Toy Story really meant to the viewers I don't compare films,0.11063044
but this is a fourth installment of previously being one of the most epic franchises,0.09980789
ever one of the most epic trilogies ever and because of this story it has,0.053455338
tainted this epic Toy Story franchise for me this story was rushed pointless and disconnecting,0.4072425
to me as a viewer I've watched Toy Story and adored the stories of Toy,0.06666054
Story since 95 and I'm keeping one honey cuz I don't want to get emotional,0.087019086
but Toy Story is very emotional to me because I collect toys I love toys,0.15516579
and since 95 it has always been one of my favorites I go and watch,0.060921397
Toy Story when I feel is sad when I'm angry alongside with Land Before Time,0.07036466
I love those movies and when you when you watch it and you see the,0.08082953
trash and the disrespect that they give them characters like wait and Buzz and they,0.53490317
just sit on them and just put their fit and a step on those characters,0.23970868
oh it's disrespectful and I hate it I hate it and I'm pissed off because,0.6797539
I didn't ask for this movie but I was willing to give it a chance,0.051494602
because I honestly was like yo you know it's cool let's find out what happened,0.10798526
to Bo Peep I'm okay with both peeping in his movie I'm gonna carry with,0.13495286
Bo Peep in his movie but the disrespect to woody my favorite character and how,0.07219956
they set him back in this story and just pushed agenda after agenda I couldn't,0.06394401
I didn't understand you I'm like why I didn't go in this movie looking for,0.12071662
something I was just giving something and how it just disconnected with me I just,0.1153103
felt bad for me and the future of kids this story was terrible this is,0.17369005
not a good movie when it comes to story and script they try to force,0.1193048
emotion in this movie they got emotion they got anger not happiness or sadness I'm,0.14182192
pissed off by this trash story Toy Story 1 myths under to me it meant,0.77146125
something because I understood it the development of how they came up with this movie,0.07472903
was phenomenal a toy gets replaced let's tell a story about how a toy feels,0.097450644
when they get replaced and how every other everything around it enjoys the new you,0.2773467
know I'm saying they enjoy that sheet and seeing woody get replaced and having to,0.19143748
overcome that and going with witty through his journey to become friends with buzz I,0.092019886
thought was tight yo I'm like that's real life that's how it happens you could,0.14652337
be the top dude in school and somebody cooler comes and everyone loves that cool,0.09063238
guy and they kind of put you in the back and you're like I got,0.19100425
it I'm cool too don't remember me and how you two become friends after all,0.12820631
that she and become best friends it's beautiful Toy Story 2 becoming a collectible that's,0.14686905
a life span of a toy you get so old you become a collectible as,0.578884
beautiful seeing woody my favorite character become a collectible item not knowing where he came,0.08754421
from figuring out all this stuff and accepting the circumstances and his friends coming to,0.054343686
rescue him because they know he was stolen and then not just that they go,0.15028635
through an epic journey I'm playing catch with my dad they go to a toy,0.1587172
store just beautiful and then it is with it is with it ends with part,0.10213916
three what happens to a toy when you grow up most toys get thrown away,0.2719369
so we're giving away they gave the toys away to a freaking daycare and seeing,0.574145
how the toys interact from being number one to being wrecked by little kids spit,0.53456336
on toe up just tow the toys up and lots o to bear bro just,0.15357414
being a hater seeing the journey find a way back to Andy's house and then,0.15667102
what are you doing you just grow out of your toys you find another little,0.37382194
kid and you give your toys away you give your toys away to somebody else,0.31143308
because you cherish that I still got my first teddy bear sitting right there I,0.3089369
9ne call me selfish I'm doing a sheep but I understand they give they towards,0.2221433
the bunny and she loves the toys and then we get this trash story and,0.48055217
part 4 where she makes a fork spoon 40 sport whatever and she loves the,0.17640151
sport more than those toys and he doesn't want to be a toy he keeps,0.15321195
running away and what he keeps putting himself in lost danger to keep retrieving this,0.11915107
stupid fork this is stupid fork it has nothing to do with anything Toy Story,0.8598538
related this was a disgrace and despicable trash story /script i enjoyed by a bow,0.7093121
peace journey but goddamn what about woody they sad all over witty he took the,0.73992044
back seat in this new world we live in and I'm gonna say and I,0.12399478
try not to say because I try to see the brighter side of life but,0.0872407
this whack sjw that we dealing with I'm sick of it I am sick of,0.53490317
it I am tired of it they set woody back wait he is a leader,0.19909728
and I would have loved to see winning a boat people eat together not him,0.25568405
sit in a backside this man this toy has found his way home three films,0.5189371
and alone TV specials and now he just wrecked body needs us body Fred Barney,0.44676366
men trash story trash script I can't believe that Disney milked a cow like this,0.60465133
is so hurting I was there in 95 yo I was there when it all,0.15429902
began me and my little brother VHS the mobile big old dick man Toy Story,0.8785311
had the best line of stories anybody could ask for and Disney this is the,0.048728064
third and this is a third franchise they have ruined with their agenda based films,0.16309291
trying to please an audience who don't even watch these films who don't even buy,0.31398147
these toys who don't even care about these characters stop appealing to people who don't,0.19528008
even have we don't care about this and it hurts when you hear when you,0.14868924
watch and you see what they have done to Toy Story God leave and I,0.1446908
told dr. C and I told David I was like why I gotta be to,0.052397713
win cuz it just sucks that no one is speaking on this crash Toy Story,0.8226378
4 story is script it just just pissed all over what they had they brought,0.31089434
to life and I hate it this is the worst toy story film period it,0.49216953
has good elements but overall Toy Story meant something it wasn't it didn't mean something,0.051704455
visually it means something just by the acting the voice act nah it was the,0.050416492
story that made you feel something in the way part 3 ended with that story,0.058580138
man then it came this trash dan let's talk about pros let's talk about cons,0.591781
the pros of this film is the voice acting I thought the voice actors did,0.12291835
a phenomenal job vibrant like I said Keegan stole the show from me he was,0.2802921
funny breath of fresh air I wish they had you're keeping the Jordan Peele and,0.16363314
keegan-michael key and the other toy stories I thought they would have brought something magical,0.06493246
to that because I felt like out of everybody else even even though I love,0.15030265
Tom Hanks I felt that they took a backseat and key and Peele really cared,0.15013005
about being in this movie more than any other voice actors to me everything they,0.11481066
did hit hard it was like okay all right just everything about them from that,0.3205854
voice was just there and you could tell that the way they came off they,0.0953711
really wanted to be part of this and to me it felt like to them,0.08496398
it wasn't just a job it was let's let's try to make this tight I,0.119997054
think I could put my swag on this and be tight let's talk about the,0.12965481
cons the story the disconnecting factor of this story is a con for me hearing,0.24007408
all these these people raving over this movie oh my god it was so hard,0.4033806
Phil oh my god I feel so bad miss me with that trash this story,0.52720565
was garbage and it messed this whole movie up I don't want to spoil anything,0.5540915
but there were certain scenes in here that I was like why did you do,0.044601664
that why would you do that why would you frickin do that that doesn't make,0.546895
any sense who does that we live in a world that is falling apart and,0.1476
I'm seeing it through film first we cannot keep appealing to people who don't even,0.27281085
care who just want to be seen who don't care about anything else but just,0.08800518
being seen this agenda based stuff and these movies look every every film even back,0.07948961
in the day everything had an agenda but you know what there was one thing,0.06353898
about class and agenda this film had no class with his agenda we got very,0.11232114
little of the crew another kind I come to see woody buzz Rex slinky Jesse,0.2498203
bullseye I came to see my favorite characters and I didn't even get them I,0.084852174
got all these new characters which I had I liked the duck in a rabbit,0.24055979
but damn what about everybody else we spent too much time on a spork a,0.69542736
trash eating loving land in dirt spork that was the spit in the face disconnected,0.561664
immediately I just can't take it I am very sad what they have done with,0.07273096
this let's give this film a grade I love the voice acting they did a,0.08967887
phenomenal job the directing was cool visually dope you know I'm saying 2019 they got,0.1544525
the money they got the works it's gonna look tight but this movie doesn't base,0.09877647
off of action and tight looking boys acting means something but the story is script,0.08733785
and the musical just was not there it just wasn't there and it hurts because,0.062056936
you need music to build the climactic scenes so you can feel the emotions you,0.11472599
need a good story to blend in with the music so you can feel the,0.046036147
emotions that's the beauty of Toy Story because it doesn't matter how old you are,0.22006111
what color you are what race you are what we're living you believe in we,0.31089434
all had toys before that's the beauty of Toy Story it's one of the one,0.122696005
things that everybody can appreciate a love for toy and watching that journey and they,0.0575263
just sit it all on that cebra and I can't believe how they did them,0.13612004
just milking the cow like what the Freak why would you do that with that,0.49099916
said y'all I'm gonna give this movie got my hands moving in so you gotta,0.14365268
hear I'm trying to hold it in I'm gonna give this movie a c-minus is,0.13268696
