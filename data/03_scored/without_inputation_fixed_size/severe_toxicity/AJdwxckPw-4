what is up guys do here and this weekend I went out and saw Lulu,0.056849256
Wang's affair well which is finally out here on UK screens it's been a little,0.05669826
while as usual a good film comes out in the US everyone goes a little,0.028088044
bit nuts for it gets low as it buzz and we just sort of sat,0.1967886
there waiting waiting on our little British arses but before we get into the juiciness,0.59683716
of today's review I wouldn't be a youtuber if I didn't ask you to subscribe,0.019661497
so if we can do that for me right now cheers mate now that's out,0.027509335
the way I guess we can talk about some films film singular it's only one,0.035587326
film it's the farewell so as I said it starts by Loulou Wang I've not,0.03248158
seen any of her work before as far as I'm aware this is like her,0.051914923
second feature film and essentially it's sort of based on real-life events that have happened,0.030818623
to her and her family premise of this one being is a family in China's,0.02414284
grandma finds out she has cancer or rather the family find out but don't want,0.09629132
to tell her because and I had absolutely no idea this was a custom in,0.032032583
China but apparently it's seen as a bad thing to tell someone of that age,0.060989358
that they're going to die they just rather let them live their life to the,0.36253446
fullest until they absolutely have to know so you have this weird kind of fake,0.14789294
wedding they have to set up to get her to come and see them home,0.09442282
it's an interesting premise and it leads to a very interesting film I was a,0.023194954
big big fan of this one it starts awkwafina in the lead role here and,0.03737933
I mean she crushes it she really does I've not seen a whole lot of,0.039926317
Aquafina x' work I think I saw her last in ocean's 8 and then a,0.04681895
couple of supporting roles here and there and so I'm not too well-versed on Aquafina,0.01668081
as an actress but she really did a good job here it's a sort of,0.06850726
performance which works best because it's not going for all these crazy big moments there's,0.1715329
no huge breakdowns or anything I hate saying it but it's a very real performance,0.09394655
which is the strongest compliment I reckon you can give to a performance in a,0.024924431
film like this because ultimately it needs to feel real to work and it does,0.02769093
so yeah aquafina did a great job and the rest of the cast of the,0.06578733
great job as well and it's also a testament to the writing of Lulu Wang,0.016887017
here who also writes as well as directs and the biggest compliment I can give,0.05448253
to the film is it a hundred percent feels like I'm watching a real family,0.015683034
interact the relationships on screen unfolding in exactly the same way I'd expect a real,0.024101598
family's relationship to unfold and that makes it just incredibly interesting and engaging to watch,0.044498127
it's always fun watching characters interact on screen it just feels like the normal way,0.017841555
characters wouldn't it doesn't feel like a very flashy out-there screenplay and doesn't need that,0.019203186
it's not going for that I have to give special props to the Nana in,0.030865187
this film I think I kind of fell in love with her and I would,0.0951053
like her to be my own Nana in real life I want her to read,0.12017607
me stories at bedtime goddamnit she's adorable and you immediately sort of fall in love,0.6091841
with her which in itself makes the whole rest of the film just work because,0.024094947
I can't help but feel like this film would have fallen a little bit flat,0.075417854
if you were thinking that grandma's a but the concept of the film this whole,0.018389001
idea that they don't want to tell the grandmother that she's dying so they have,0.14088391
to come up with this fabricated wedding to get away with getting everyone they know,0.056261897
together to say goodbye to her it's a really really interesting one and it works,0.045358207
really well in the film it's naturally kind of bittersweet premise in itself and you,0.039759357
can see how immediately that narrative lends itself quite well to being almost kind of,0.03404144
farcical with a lot of laugh and humor there and you can understand how it's,0.15598424
inevitably going to start hitting the fan and you're gonna start getting a little bit,0.4387785
teary I did both of it for me I found it to be funny when,0.030451441
it needs to be I also found it to be incredibly poignant and quite moving,0.055423766
when it needs to be as well and I think it comes down to the,0.039367564
fact that even though we're watching a Chinese family and it's set in China for,0.04480544
the most part and it's talking about Chinese customs and traditions the characters are written,0.022803161
well enough and the relationships are real enough to feel like you can relate to,0.010017
almost anyone in this family because a granted depending on life experiences in age I'm,0.028666755
sure there's not one person here that hasn't ever worried about some of the love,0.03660572
passing away let alone had to go through some of their love passing away I,0.069549605
don't feel like it's a bit of a cop-out to criticize this film for not,0.048944212
ever being as amazing as other people making out to be but I do feel,0.08560714
like there are certain moments which could have landed better there are certain aspects of,0.016904311
it which I maybe wrongly was expecting to be a little bit more I don't,0.06966202
know flooring I guess it's probably not the right word at all a certain moments,0.024821993
I think could have been executed a little better and being a little bit more,0.5311385
effective for that one of those being the ending I really liked the ending I,0.053160146
thought it was a really strong ending and actually sort of that the bit leading,0.1848552
up to the ending I thought was really really well done I was crying so,0.03813897
it did something right but the very very ending of this film left me in,0.064285345
two minds don't go into too many details cuz I don't wanna spoil anything about,0.1167404
the film but one half of me thinks yeah it's really sweet the other half,0.033297762
of me thinks kinda a little bit cheesy a little bit obvious but I've said,0.12809907
it before and I'll say it again I don't really have a huge problem with,0.028276958
cheese I guess if it worked it worked and and Who am I they didn't,0.009862013
work because I had tears streaming down my face if it had cut maybe a,0.24107186
tiny bit earlier and and not showing us a little bit more I think it,0.11703374
would have been more beneficial for that I'll leave it at that it's a really,0.08076993
really solid film a laughed I cried enjoyed watching these characters on screen consider me,0.056992933
a loo doing fan now I'm totally on board for wherever she ends up doing,0.03935692
