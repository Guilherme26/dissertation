If you Smile through your fear and
sorrow, Smile and maybe tomorrow, you'll see the Sun come shining through, for you, light up your face with gladness, hide every trace of sadness, although a
tear may be ever so near, that's the time you must keep on trying, Smile what's the
use of crying, you'll find that life is still worthwhile, if you just Smile!
You'll find the life's worthwhile... If you, just Smile! "Modern "Times" is NoPerfectMovie! "Ha-Cha-Cha-Cha-Cha"! Hats off to anyone who actually understood that
reference by the way, I'm sure there's at least one or two... anyways, I'm hoping-
Grandma, Grandpa, you know what I'm talking about-don't you? Anyways, "Modern Times" was Charlie Chaplin's last film as the Little Tramp, who in this movie is
living in the Great Depression, he's struggling alongside this orphan girl
that he recently met (Paulette Goddard) because of two reasons: one being
the tramps usual bad luck and two being how work industries were changing
possibly for the worst at that time; businesses were replacing manual labor
with machinery for the sake of saving a profit and the machinery that did
require manual labour had so many advances that it became tough for
labourers to handle the machinery in the first place, which of course leads to
some of the best physical comedy in this movie! I was really excited to check
out "Modern Times" because I've actually never seen a full-length silent movie,
I've only seen clips from Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies
in video essays as examples of really good sight gags and I agreed with all of
that-I thought they were funny but I never really had the urge to check them
out, plus streaming services have few to none in regards to silent movies
because there really isn't that big of a demand other than huge, hardcore film
aficionados but since I'm covering classical movies and I've always wanted
to check out more silent movies anyways and with all the free time that I had, I
gave "Modern Times" a view on Netflix and it was my first and thankfully not last
silent movie I'll ever see because "Modern Times" was such a huge surprise in so many ways-the biggest surprise of course being with the with the physical comedy-
with the slapstick! You hear it all the time that Charlie Chaplin was a comedic
genius in the silent era and I was hesitant to think that way because I'm
not really a big fan of labeling directors as 'geniuses' or 'hacks' but
having seen this movie, Charlie Chaplin really was a comedic genius because of
how great he was at selling a laugh without any words
whatsoever! It didn't matter if the gags were forced or obvious or so predictable
that you could see them coming a mile away, what really matters and what was
Chaplin's greatest skill was his comedic timing and delivery because he and the
other actors have these exaggerated facial expressions that tell you
everything you need to know about these people without any dialogue whatsoever
but never to a point where it felt cartoony or unrealistic, if anything the
stunts in this movie seen as plausible as you could possibly get and that's
because the gags and the reactions to the gags were (for the most part) done in
one single take which made it feel real, made it feel impressive and made us
understand these characters as people while still laughing at them because
that's something that slapstick comedies often don't really understand: these
sight gags, the reactions-especially matters so much to the characters and in
many cases the reactions matter more than the pratfalls because the Tramp has 2 recurring reactions that really sum him up as a character; one is this
dumbfounded look of confusion that happens for two reasons-one of which is
when he's in the wrong place in the wrong time and he's in he's an innocent
person who doesn't understand what's going on and he suffers for it, or the
second one being when he has intentionally caused someone some
problems and he just doesn't realize it, and the second expression is this very
coy, guilty smile that says that he understands the trouble that he's in,
that he didn't mean any harm to anyone and that he's willing to make amends
with these people as opposed to just lashing out at each other and that's kind of the reason that makes the Little Tramp such a likeable character; he is gullible, he is naive, he does make a
lot of stupid decisions but he never means any ill will of anyone and if he
realizes that he made any mistakes, he'll feel guilty about it-he'll want to help
anyone as quickly as possible and it's what leads him to making so many lasting friendships in each of his movies. It's a character trope and
it's a character personality that I think any casual audience can really
understand and relate to; we've all made dumb mistakes without the intention of
hurting people and if we have, we feel guilty about it, we want to make amends
and that's what really makes him such a realistic and likeable character, it
makes it a lot easier to laugh for him and at the people that he's causing
trouble and mischief to and it also makes us feel a little sad whenever the
slapstick happens to him because we've latched on to him as a character so much!
But one of (for me) the best qualities about this movie and something
that I think gets overlooked about silent movies 'cause I don't hear people
talk about this that much, the music! Chaplin was one of the few directors who
actually did the musical score for his own films there's been some complaints
about the assistants he's worked with who some feel have contributed more to
the music, but his primary assistant on "Modern Times" and I'm gonna try and get
this guy's name right here, let's see... David Raskin described his creative
process when it came to writing a musical score; Chaplin knew how to play
piano, violin and cello... what he didn't know how to do was read or write
sheet music so whenever Chaplin knew what each scene sounded like in his own
head he would improvise some notes on a piano or he would humming out loud and Raskin would write down exactly what he was humming and put it to sheet music so that they can get a clearer idea of how to record the music and more importantly
synchronize it to the movie to each scene-to each pratfall because the music
really does elevate the over-the-top expressions that these
characters give or the much more somber and sad moments in the movie a lot more depth & tension whenever there's a pratfall, the music makes it
seem so whimsical & cheerful because what we're watching is funny but with
the dramatic scenes-especially with the song "Smile" which he wrote the music-he
didn't write the lyrics, the lyrics came around the Nat King Cole times when that
song became popular but especially with that romance theme, it has this somber
but bittersweet sense of hope because the thing that I didn't anticipate going
into this movie was that "Modern Times" was kind of a comedy-drama, especially
when they introduced this orphaned girl and when she comes across the Tramp, they have this abrupt romance but you still buy into it because they do have a lot
of things in common ;they have no one else in their lives to depend upon-no
friends or family anymore, they make a lot of morally questionable choices for
really no reason other than survival. They don't do it because they
want to, they do it because they feel as if they have to and in some cases... yeah,
they probably did and they even do have some greedy moments-especially when
they're crashing this department store and they're trying on these new shoes
and sleeping in these beds, I noticed very closely that most of the characters in
this movie wear black on the outside and white on the inside to symbolize that
they're poor but at one point the orphaned girl puts on these
white bedsheets and lies in this all-white bed, these silk cushions and
these very furry blankets that symbolize their fantasies, their temptations that
they want for their own lives and then once they snap back into the black on
the outside, white on the inside it's that difference between fantasy and
reality that makes it really hard to contribute colour symbolism to a black-and-white movie but Charlie Chaplin really did find a way to make it work!
Now as for problems I do feel as if the orphaned girl (while she was still really
good as an actress and as a character) there are some things about her
backstory that I thought were gonna have more involvement with in regards
this story but after a while, after this really shitty occurrence happens in her
life that changes everything for her, everything else that matters to her-
every other person that she's met they become practically non-existent and
then all she can think about is having a life with the Tramp (she has fantasies
that are exclusively him and none of these other people that are in a worse
situation that she can't depend upon) but I was under the impression that
she would later come back to help them out but that wasn't the case, maybe
she thought that it was too late for her to do something like that and if
so, I can completely understand that because the morals are about how the
world is a really unfortunate place and there are always going to be consequences
whether you're innocent or guilty of something but it's no reason to not move forward, it's no reason to give up because you don't know what lies ahead
of you and leads to a fantastic ending, a fantastic final shot that is iconic
among Chaplin fans and I completely agree! If you've never seen a silent
movie before, definitely seek out "Modern Times" on Netflix! iIt is really funny, it's
also really sad, the music is top-notch, the actors all do fantastic work just
with their facial expressions and body language in ways that modern actors... I'm not entirely sure if they can do just as well anymore, they
can obviously do well on their own but compared to actors who did
it because they had no choice, I'm not entirely sure but who knows, maybe in the
future this this genre of silent era might become popular again, who knows? So for all those reasons, I'm gonna give "Modern Times" 4/5! Guys, thanks as
