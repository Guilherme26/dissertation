rumor is Jordan Peele wants to direct a live-action gargoyles movie like why hasn't that been greenlit like right now doesn't really have anything to do with us I'm just saying it's a good question to ask why not so us is the new movie written and directed by Jordan Peele which can we just address the fact and appreciate the fact that we're there now we're at the point where it's like oh the new Jordan Peele movie most directors it takes a couple movies to get there took Jordan Peele one took him get out that was that now we're here good job to him so us follows a family of four they're on vacation they go to the vacation cab and the wife the mother is a group to starve the entire movies played by Lupita Nyong'o and the husband and father of the families played by Winston Duke yes that is mbaku I love that dude I love that he didn't get you know let's just say and while they're at their vacation cabin they basically get terrorized by this other family by other family I mean some evil version of their family same actors played the good ones and their evil opposites at first I was like cause it's like a home invasion movie at first and that's what I loved about Jordan Peele the guy transcends the horror movie genre a lot of people critics reviewers fans myself included watch a lot of modern-day horror movies and were like ah it doesn't really have it I'm looking for I hope someone brings something new to the genre I'm just saying we've seen it all cuz it's not just horror its horror it's thriller I would call this movies thrillers more than horror there are definitely horror movie elements in it like a first I was like home invasion movie then it goes on to kind of feeling like a slasher movie then it feels like a horror chase movie this is the plot progresses it evolves and it gets bigger and everyone did a great job in it like Lupita Nyong'o we know she's good we've seen it be great so it's no surprise that she's great in this movie just kind of it frustrates you to see that other movies that have her just kind of waste her come on Maz Kanata you're wasting Lupita Nyong'o I'm usually young actors that dislike well are they gonna pull it off mmm and that's without them having to play a good version in a bad version of themselves what is everyone in this movie pulled it off and I pulled off something that's not easy to do and Winston Duke I haven't seen a lot of movies with him in it other than Black Panther but this is totally a different role than Black Panther he shows that he can just be a normal family man is funny and by funny I mean the Jordan Peele hits a good zone here a lot of people are like I'm gonna interject humor but doesn't always fly with Jordan Peele most of the time he hits a good zone where it doesn't compromise the horror in general or at least the thriller element couple of times one in particular if anyone asks me for an example this senile bring up it was a scene where I'm like you're being way too humorous way too light-hearted for the tone they're going for right now which is intense and you're about to die why are you having this conversation why are you having this much too long humorous conversation that's much too long and much more humorous than it should be for the situation really Jordan Peele shows that he is the man he's the new guys the new face of thrillers in cinema he isn't know what I'm saying here he's the new Shyamalan like the early days of Shyamalan you know when it was like oh my gosh an M night Shyamalan movie he made a new movie I'm gonna watch it like right now that's Jordan Peele for this generation in fact please don't compare us to get out it would be like comparing unbreakable to the sixth sense couple of times in this movie I was like oh my god that's hard to watch nothing anything particularly violent was happening in there but it was just it was intense that's what Jordan Peele apparently understands about thrillers and horror movies is that it's not they're just for gore you're telling a story about characters in this case a family if you want things to be thrilling and or scariest not with blood you need the audience to make them feel like they're just in mortal danger and when he goes for that he hits the bull's eye in the end I really enjoyed us it had what I was looking for for a movie like this where I get out and I'm like I like the Outer Limits I like The Twilight Zone this reminded me of that and or black mayor haven't seen black bear seen a couple episodes of black mayor but every time I compare a movie to the twilight zone or the Outer Limits people in comment section are like and black mayors all right taking it on faith and black mayor I walk out of us saying that was a great time worth watching in theaters and worth buying on blu-ray at the very least taking your friend to embittered you want to say pretty sweet movies let's go definitely support this movie if you like good movies and or if you want to see the gargoyles movie that he wants to do I mean it's worth supporting without the option of gargoyles but you know what I'm saying right so us have you seen it why did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you liked what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more [Music]
