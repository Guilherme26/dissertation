get out get out get out is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele you may know from Key & Peele a very very,0.06246943
hilarious sketch comedy show that I've been a big fan of I like the movie,0.09152835
Keanu I didn't love it but I really think this guy's talented as well as Keegan they're both,0.3086624
hilarious so I was very curious to see where Jordan Peele could bring to a horror,0.17458959
film and this is definitely told from a very unique perspective we don't commonly see in genre filmmaking at the center of the film is a Mantid in the middle of an interracial,0.12372314
relationship and he's told by a,0.041611683
girlfriend,0.061882567
he's about to meet her family for the first time although they are unaware of the fact that he's black and so that really makes him feel awkward when he gets there though all seems okay for a while until he begins to realize there's some sinister stuff going on behind the scenes I'm a big fan of horror you guys know that I've loved these movies in my entire life and when a good one comes along it gives me the chills it gives me the tingles it gives me something to think about and talk about and it inspires me that's why when I saw the trailer for this movie I was particularly enticed because it's definitely a courageous viewpoint you don't commonly see films like this told from this perspective,0.2681703
and I got to say walking out of it I'm really impressed with Jordan Peele and I cannot wait to see what else,0.13151568
he does this is a very special debut because not only does he show that he understands how to direct genre films how to make a horror scene interesting or fun,0.12579952
particularly the fantastic opening scene that to my knowledge was one take which I really liked but also that his singular voice can be maintained and come through your stereotypical genre filmmaking because yes this film has a lot of horror tropes jump-scares things popping out of you people walking past the hallway corridor accompanied by a loud jolt of music,0.18640004
but all through that it maintains,0.05939252
its originality because of its central story and that unique perspective is told through quite a bit of racial commentary and satire because this film definitely has a satirical edge to it,0.11171605
and there are a lot of moments throughout the movie they cause some serious laughter to come from the entire audience,0.05440303
because it understands that although this is a over the top for a movie with some very sinister elements behind,0.17219727
the scenes,0.060921486
there's definitely something to be said about the awkwardness that one feels when he's in the middle of something that he's not entirely used to,0.06066017
and in this case Jordan Peele had said that he does sometimes feel very awkward,0.22497517
when he's the only black person around,0.6296683
and so we wanted to tell a story from the perspective of somebody dealing with that see I grew up in a very mixed race environment,0.10766846
I had tons of friends of color,0.24185358
so I never really saw this myself personally I grew up in a very all-inclusive family that believed that everyone is people we're all human and like it doesn't matter and I still feel that way and I'm really really grateful for that upbringing because I've since learned as an adult that that's rare,0.11483356
so seeing a film like this can sometimes get under my skin,0.14457087
because I genuinely don't understand racism and that's because I never was really exposed to it on a full scale,0.19016266
so when I see it in movies like this,0.06891664
I have a hard time connecting with it,0.07878438
and that's why I am,0.05156854
so glad that Jordan Peele wrote and directed this movie because he has taken,0.11194413
this aspect of the story that could get under a lot of people's skin and made it so refreshing from his viewpoint because he has some amazing comic relief from lil rel Howery who stole every scene he was in this guy-- look for him man he is going to be in so much now he was so fricking hilarious in this movie he had cane stitches in virtually,0.43386078
every single sequence so Jordan Peele understands the seriousness of this subject matter,0.08423004
but also he is able to find considerable humor in it and that was so refreshing daniel Kaluga plays the lead character and i apologize sir if I said your name incorrectly I thought he was brilliant in the film I didn't realize until after I saw it that he's actually from London,0.06121375
his accent is perfect,0.096278794
I didn't even know for a second,0.07326068
he was from the UK fantastic performance Bradley Whitford is also really funny and good in this film really all around the performances are very strong,0.056732554
there's a good sense to the horror as well towards,0.15371238
the third act that builds to some really satisfying moments that had a lot of people,0.084878854
in my audience cheering as for issues with this movie,0.06934137
there was a shot in the trailer of a roaring deer skeletal monster,0.44628778
and I was really enticed by that and I was excited to see where that would play into this film,0.100011244
it's not in the movie though I hate when trailers do that when I insert things in their trailer that end up just being on the cutting room floor road one excuse me that was a still getting over that cold sorry also sometimes the pacing does suffer,0.18107098
there are a lot of sequences that are just very weird that are meant to make you feel like you're watching a very awkward episode of The Twilight Zone,0.1459018
and sometimes it works,0.052462883
but there are other times where you jump between tones a little too quickly,0.10293861
also there's some scares in the movie that,0.06668179
in retrospect don't really make sense,0.097451165
there's one sequence where this guy is just running at full speed towards our main character,0.13962089
and then he just kind of darts to the right instantly in retrospect once I know what's going on under the surface,0.15540941
of this movie,0.08450597
I don't really get what's happening there,0.053890422
it seemed like it was just a scare meant for the audience,0.100144766
and it doesn't really do much for the story I think you'll enjoy yourself I'm impressed with the way Jordan Peele handled this directorial debut his voice is still heard while also being a very entertaining genre film for horror fans the pacing does suffer sometimes it's not a perfect tone,0.13569738
and sometimes the humor does feel a little tacked on and I'm looking forward to seeing it again,0.10618715
