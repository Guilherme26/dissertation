hello,0.054463096
everybody Steph Koza here welcome to my channel check out my fancy new chair whoa,0.26871565
I'll be talking a little bit more about this chair at the end of the video so stick around if you want to know about my new friend here but for now it's time to talk about Toy Story 4,0.14961243
so I'm a huge Toy Story fan who isn't a huge Toy Story fan we all grew up with it we all watch the movies and they're all just so great honestly probably one of my favorite Pixar movies of all time is the first Toy Story cuz it just gives you those those warm,0.15166229
bubbly,0.084767155
you know makes you feel nice inside until they made Toy Story 3 and they ripped my goddamn heart out but when they made Toy Story 3 it kind of closed up the whole story nicely wrapped it up with a bow and everyone was kind of like alright toy story's over they grew up with Andy,0.5534026
and he sent them off and the journey was complete and it was done,0.06489895
and then they were like hello Norman Toy Story 4 and everyone was kind of like ok nobody asked for it nobody thought it was gonna happen it happened here we are and I'm gonna tell you that I am really glad that,0.11767979
it happened,0.054381996
I was kind of against this movie even though I love Toy Story,0.12860143
I was like this just feels like a cash grab like it's not really a necessary film the series felt very complete to me,0.069543414
I don't really think Toy Story 4 was necessary however I had a really really really good time watching Toy Story 4 in fact I think Toy Story 4 might be my second favorite of the toy stories,0.052698746
I do need to rewatch number 2,0.07766794
it's been a while but I did like it better than twice Tori 3,0.07753561
I really did nothing will ever beat,0.09081156
the first one come on come on but Toy Story 3 for me felt very I don't know it had some good moments,0.121358484
and it came at a good time in my life and it felt very final and it it had a really big emotional impact on me,0.093810275
but as a film I would say it's probably the worst of all of them it just got a little of weird for me got a little too extreme and very dark,0.24147855
they took a dark turn with Toy Story 3 and I think they realized that in Toy Story 4 because it's much more lighthearted it's very fun,0.12573531
it's definitely the funniest of all the Toy Story movies like I was laughing,0.09328631
the whole time I had a smile on my face constantly it wasn't very like heart-wrenching,0.10777639
I mean it has it has some heart-wrenching moments,0.08723955
it's a Pixar film come on but of all the Pixar films and of all the toy stories,0.16447292
I think it's the one that made me cry the least I actually didn't cry at all,0.11516807
there was like one moment where I was like I was like almost getting a little there which was a little bit surprising but honestly kind of nice and refreshing because it just felt very light-hearted,0.06794031
and it was a different kind of journey and it was fun and adventurous and I didn't know where they were gonna go,0.055069923
and I just had a really good time,0.05038676
so the story of Toy Story 4 is essentially after the events of Toy Story 3 and Dee grows up he goes to college and he gives his box of toys away to this little girl named Bonnie,0.11231878
so bonnie is like the new Andy,0.15303141
I guess so she has all these toys they'll have Bonnie written on their shoe,0.3487814
they live in Bonnie's room now that's their whole world,0.07231747
and it's a bit of a shock for woody because he was so used to being the favorite toy and now Bonnie wants pretty much nothing to do with him,0.11531594
and he's just shoved in the closet all the time,0.43145418
so this is very much Woody's story sort of a personal growth sort of thing,0.05690797
I guess they're all kind of Woody's personal growth,0.076697715
but this one especially is all about woody and kind of figuring out himself which sounds weird,0.1317599
when you say it like that but it was very well done,0.07131989
there's also a lot of Bo Peep in this movie she is a huge character in Toy Story 4 which I was a little bit iffy on at first but no Bo is not here to mess around bo is the best I love Bo Peep,0.10144365
she was one of the best characters in the movie she was incredible her and woody their dynamic together was so great she was so fun she was so badass never thought I'd say that about Bo Peep Keanu Reeves is in this movie he plays a Canadian stuntman named Duke kaboom if that's not enough to sell you on this movie,0.13456732
I don't know,0.1431935
what is he's so great,0.0996707
I everything that he does it's it's just,0.086066864
so great along with Duke kaboom we have some other new characters we have forky who is just hilarious,0.28274274
I loved 4q so much,0.061524436
I can't wait till they start selling little plush toys of for ki because even though I could easily make a for ki,0.26233414
I'm gonna buy a for ki,0.114652276
we also have key and Peele who played two carnival prize stuffed animals and just they can do no wrong key and Peele can do no wrong pretty sure they improved every single line in this film and I'm a hundred percent,0.10159492
okay with that I always get a little bit worried when they introduce new characters into Toy Story or into series like this but honestly they really carried themselves if anything they were introduced really smoothly they didn't feel like,0.058098223
they were overpowering the old characters like they're very much around they added a really nice element,0.060329974
they made it feel a little more fresh,0.0576758
and they were just really fun and funny and very enjoyable to watch there are also some new toys introduced that are like the villain of the story,0.09908852
I guess no spoilers but my god they are,0.088949636
so did the stuff of nightmares the stuff of nightmares,0.18236795
I just hmm,0.04702357
and I think the animation has like really stepped up since the last horror story movie which makes it so much more visceral and you really feel like you're in these like tiny toy sized environments,0.15230653
and all of the toys really look like toys that have come to life like Bo Peep has this very shiny porcelain look to her there are some other characters that are like terrifyingly accurate like they truly felt like I was watching a live-action showcase of these toys just like walking around and talking,0.13388747
I guess is the point of Toy Story but it was very convincing,0.082488626
I had a smile on my face honestly the entire time,0.15638973
I was watching this film I've I remember when I when the credits started rolling I was like I can't it's stuck,0.07697747
my face hurts cuz,0.4033573
I was just smiling the whole time and literally my face hurt from smiling it was really fun,0.07599615
I would 100% buy this watch it again I think if you love Toy Story or if you love pick sar or if you just want to see a good movie go see Toy Story take kids go by yourself,0.16751175
I don't care,0.2042832
it's just great like,0.036796533
I said I need to watch the other ones again because it's been a while but I think I would rank them Toy Story 1 Toy Story for Toy Story 3 Toy Story 2 truthfully it's been forever since I saw the second one so I I don't know maybe it's amazing,0.0710286
I don't know I'm reading of Toy Story for a 5 out of 5 been a while since I gave a 5 out of 5 but I truthfully have no complaints I had a really good time it was really cute,0.068129085
it was really heartwarming it had a really beautiful message fun for the whole family so that's it for my review of Toy Story did you see Toy Story,0.08658664
