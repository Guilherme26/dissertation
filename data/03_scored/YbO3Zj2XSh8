mark and I'm amazed at how accessible this movie makes alternate realities for non comic-book,0.07948742
readers I mean I am a comic book reader and I love me some alternate,0.11147186
realities but I've never liked it with spider-man but here rapt attention I think my,0.18847461
favorite thing about the movie is that it takes itself so seriously I mean it's,0.0817093
animated so it can be highly stylized and closer to its comic-book roots right from,0.087081045
the get-go and you even see the way this movie opens with the credits you'll,0.11359871
be like I think I'm in for something special and you are but it's very,0.104266584
much still it seems very much like a live-action movie you've been hoping for in,0.12518534
terms we know when it comes to the evolution of animation but I'm talking about,0.06987036
scope depth action scenes and what's at stake this is the Beauty and the Beast,0.18576267
of superhero animated movies I'm also in awe of this movie's authenticity this is Miles,0.087183945
Morales this is Peter Parker Spider Gwen but it's also miles this extended family such,0.05380471
great characters Kington Aunt May and well there are some surprises here yes while the,0.037878547
trailers have been amazing I am so impressed with how much they've been able to,0.055425197
keep hidden about this movie and I mean I can't find the running time anywhere,0.07628108
online and I checked my invitation and even Sony didn't provide it whoa this is,0.05940101
a long movie but in like in a really good way where you're like I,0.15545344
can't believe we'll be still going I never want it to end keep going keep,0.07779956
going yes give me more I really I hope hope they're working on the sequel,0.17492646
right now although I have another idea which we'll talk about in just a moment,0.046220314
but for those of you first of all worried about getting miles just right oh,0.07922698
boy do they he even speaks Spanish for instance I know a number of you,0.09534953
were worried about that but most importantly he feels is real and unique as he,0.048928093
did when he was first introduced in the comics because in the comics recently and,0.05728955
I think this has to do with Brian Michael Bendis his attention being drawn elsewhere,0.12845168
first within Marvel and then leaving for DC but miles has lost his way as,0.07155678
a character over the past couple of years I've bought every single one of his,0.09880031
comics always enjoyed them even though it's been waning a little bit recently and I'm,0.13814074
hoping that this movie reminds Marvel and Sony what a great and valuable character he,0.1425606
is I would love to see shameik Moore very talented actor should meet more fans,0.31089434
since um since dope but he does the voice of Miles Morales and I would,0.13562128
love to see him appear alongside Tom Holland in a future live-action spider-man movie and,0.10193237
you know I'd actually say the same for Hailee Steinfeld who I don't usually enjoy,0.105114296
but she is perfectly cast as spider-gwen I really liked her too come to think,0.20670387
of it they animated these characters to look a little bit like the actors so,0.10435033
they could do it they could jump to the live-action but there will always be,0.09433988
a special place in my heart for Jake Johnson spider-man I have waited so long,0.12567993
for an adult spider-man to appear on screen and it was worth the wait he,0.12847535
is perfect I also want to warn you at the beginning of the movie like,0.15721783
myself you might be like where's Jake Johnson's voice did they cast a different voice,0.07245479
don't worry he's coming it's just part of a twist in a movie full of,0.14327507
twists then as I said truly true believer best Stan Lee cameo ever no shirt,0.067576095
to be fair coming right after his tragic passing it does pull on the old,0.1179515
heartstrings just a bit harder but I still think even if you take that element,0.14871714
away it's the best Stan Lee cameo because I think for one it's associated with,0.08333459
spider-man the character he's the most associated with and then he's given such a wonderful,0.08693179
line that he says to Miles Morales it's like almost as good as the one,0.07704001
he wrote for spider-man in the comics with great power comes great responsibility and I,0.09780139
think it even plays on that a little bit it was just it perfectly captured,0.072375715
Stan Lee and on that note this is a really well-written movie so kudos to,0.073418655
