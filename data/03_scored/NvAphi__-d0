city lights was released in 1931 and was written and directed by Charlie Chaplin it,0.03852995
also stars him this was a major passion project for him and something that he,0.07113158
worked on for many years if you guys aren't familiar with Charlie Chaplin he was,0.073100045
one of the biggest stars of the silent film era his character the sometimes known,0.008931335
as The Little or he would sometimes refer to him as little man this is,0.0991317
a character that's synonymous with the silent era was one of the most famous at,0.05651745
the time and one that Chaplin had portrayed in various films and short films and,0.07534886
Chaplin's choice to make city lights as a silent film despite the fact that Hollywood,0.04661059
had begun to move towards the talkies was a divisive one because people felt at,0.13868228
the time that talkies were going to take over and of course they did but,0.06797648
Chaplin was of the belief that silent films were really what filmmaking was all about,0.12144883
in the talkies they would die out in a few years but I think his,0.32011807
real motivation for making this a silent film was that he wasn't very comfortable with,0.09516344
the idea of this character that he created existing in a talkie he didn't think,0.18039359
that the character would be as funny because it's a character that relies a lot,0.0843849
on pantomime and expressions it's very physical lots of sight gags a lot of things,0.09611284
that he does in this film are a bit like a dance so he was,0.30864862
afraid that this character would not work in a talkie and he may have been,0.1230253
right and nevertheless we have city lights as a silent film and I would say,0.06840222
it's probably my favorite silent film this is a movie about Chaplin's famed character the,0.05660866
who meets a blind woman who's selling flowers he quickly becomes infatuated with her and,0.3083203
has to try to court her without her finding out that he isn't rich and,0.14965647
when the befriends someone who actually is rich a drunk man who's trying to commit,0.4487812
suicide and he keeps him from doing that their roles switch quite often and he,0.5876557
gets the opportunity to have access to things that only a wealthy man at the,0.08473072
time would have like a car or money to buy flowers from her and so,0.11276144
now we have a moral dilemma he loves this girl she likes him back but,0.31089434
she thinks that he's rich and he's really not city lights is one of my,0.23877051
favorite romantic comedies if you were to call it that in many ways it has,0.10789649
influenced all romantic comedies that have come since then especially in its final scene I,0.1224155
have seen countless films with a moment so similar to the way this film ends,0.0821129
that you can understand why so many people credit Chaplin for showing Hollywood how to,0.06872732
make films or how they can make films that are financially successful while also being,0.08029311
critically successful because this film was both of those things Albert Einstein came to the,0.06460836
premiere and we still have a photo of that today and so you can tell,0.073717475
that Chaplin was definitely someone that people were paying attention to at the time he,0.072264485
was already famous by the time this movie came out but the idea of making,0.088125885
a silent film once talkies had been introduced reminds me of how Alfred Hitchcock decided,0.09499707
to make psycho black and white in 1960 even though colorized films were popular at,0.05170036
the time he wanted to make a film that was black and white because he,0.02958972
felt that that approach to filmmaking had more merit behind it had more suspense to,0.08502299
it he could get more things out of it than he could from a film,0.15202793
that was shot in color but what's inescapable about this film when you watch it,0.14909808
today is just how damn funny it is from scene 1 I'm laughing my ass,0.94992846
off there are so many sequences that are so simple the things that he's able,0.10028657
to do with this character a boxing match in particular this dance that everyone's doing,0.12208657
highly choreographed and very well rehearsed it's just so goddamn hilarious and that's Chaplin he,0.66964513
was such a perfectionist a lot of people when you think of a perfectionist filmmaker,0.12958427
you instantly think of someone like Stanley Kubrick who was definitely a perfectionist Chaplin may,0.3340135
have been even more so history has shown us through various interviews with cast members,0.07313035
of this film people involved in the production and documentaries about it that he would,0.14321709
shoot sequences far more than other people would he would do shot after shot take,0.65561545
after take to try to achieve something that was in his head he would sometimes,0.24077383
jump into other actors roles and perform the sequence exactly how he wanted them to,0.117330655
do it there was quite a bit of on set tension between him and star,0.17381288
Virginia charile because the way Chaplin worked he shot this film over the course of,0.32043725
a couple years and he was such a perfectionist about making everything as good as,0.10236898
it could be that some of his actors including Jarrell were getting antsy and he,0.14706965
actually fired her at one point reshot parts of the film with someone else before,0.19379535
eventually rehiring her again this is not the type of filmmaking that could be done,0.08451197
today Virginia charile today in 2018 would go on her Twitter and say Charlie Chaplin,0.15122646
just fired me and it's horrible and you know Charlie Chaplin would be faceless with,0.24190345
so much pressure from social media and the news world to be a better person,0.0726951
perhaps that's a good thing but in the long run his incredible OCD perfectionist brain,0.43608928
made one of the best films of all time and so you have to wonder,0.10615818
just at what point did Charlie Chaplin go overboard or did he go overboard by,0.067637235
firing people and rehiring people and then firing them and rehiring someone else did he,0.542956
go overboard or was he just trying to make a perfect movie in the way,0.14487693
that he felt he could it's interesting to view old Hollywood versus new Hollywood and,0.08103972
I read about the production i watch interviews i watch documentaries and I realized that,0.07218449
if this exact film was being made today it would be very controversial in the,0.07342399
way he handled himself on the set but it resulted in a great film and,0.0522667
one that is timeless because nowadays there's a bit of apprehension when you sit down,0.0891482
and watch even a black and white film kids today they don't want to watch,0.27467266
movies that are old like that even some adults don't want to watch older films,0.21506076
let alone a silent film one that is told entirely through pantomime music and some,0.08268191
sound effects this actually does have some sound effects there's a hiccuping whistle scene there's,0.09850951
some sort of like almost like Charlie Brown talking in the background where some people,0.1499662
are like a crowd in the beginning are chanting and it's like it sounds like,0.13752657
almost like a kazoo that was actually Charlie Chaplin making those sounds which makes it,0.11425014
the first time Charlie Chaplin's actual voice was ever heard in a film they're going,0.05525677
back to that apprehension that people have about watching a silent film I think it's,0.15807267
gonna be boring or that it's not going to have any action sequences or anything,0.13507582
to invest you in but from the beginning of this movie consistently I'm laughing in,0.08762527
particular the scenes with Harry Myers who plays the eccentric millionaire this guy only recognizes,0.18612882
the when he's drunk when he Sobers up in the morning he's like who are,0.27278513
you get out of my house it creates some really hilarious sequences one of the,0.19016336
best moments in the whole movie is watch how you're driving him by driving the,0.06700426
guy is literally behind the wheel Chaplin and his cast have crafted a silent film,0.31089434
that is drastically funny extremely well shot and still holds up today as a film,0.11182035
that has clearly influenced tons afterwards his sight gags the slapstick his stunt work his,0.37980732
actors are all fantastic this film is a labor of love for sure if you,0.14165837
ever read into the production and a lot of people argued and it was a,0.0799829
long time coming for Chaplin but the end result is a classic that has stood,0.056021836
the test of time and if you've never seen city lights or if you've never,0.094663784
seen a silent film before this might be a really good one to start I'm,0.048798498
gonna give city lights and a plus guys thank you so much for continuing to,0.08451547
watch my series of pre 1970s reviews I went way back with this one that,0.04233369
I wanted to talk about a silent film for sure this year you guys are,0.08370231
the best thank you so much as always for watching and look forward to more,0.03420886
