"So, plot: most Pixar movies are relatively like short,",0.12871778
so it never really felt like it dragged on or anything.,0.12165563
"It was a decent length,",0.013614411
"I didn't feel like it needed to be any shorter or longer really. I think the concepts, especially within her brain, were super thought out and well constructed.",0.21430616
"Now I will mention that this film does touch on some, you know, deep-ish issues.",0.10038494
But I also think they could've gone just a little further and it still had been passable as a family film.,0.05340359
So characters:,0.036791883
"I mean my preteen years are kind of an embarrassing blur of me wearing Ed Hardy and Bobby Jack shirts. But I'm pretty sure Riley was relatively relatable. No spoilers but the parents also had some pretty funny material too. Even if it kinda fed into the whole family unit type joke system. You'll know what I mean when you see it. The emotions were all well acted, none of them stuck out like a sore thumb.",0.10988596
"There was none of them that when they would start talking I would be like, ""Ughh just go back to the other one."" None of that,",0.10831267

"Although if an ""Inside Out"" fandom on Tumblr exists, I do see some ethical debates between the characters and the stands of them.",0.031886376
"If that exists but I mean it's Tumblr, so everything exists on Tumblr. The animation: it's Pixar,",0.07002742
"so of course the animation looked great. Again, the world building inside her head,",0.42313054
and even outside was fantastic.,0.079399146
"I do wish they had made it seem a bit larger scale,",0.07636742
"if that makes sense. The writing: I really do like that this film touched on some issues of growing up. And especially how sometimes you pretend to be happy when you're really not, and you're just trying to force yourself to be happy and it doesn't work.",0.10647845
"Sometimes you just gotta let yourself not be happy,",0.2657736
essentially. This also seemed more like a preteen slash adult movie to me than it did a kids movie. And I don't know if that works or doesn't work in the movie's favor,0.112943105
"but I think that made it more enjoyable for me, at least.",0.08220948
"I was also pleased to find that this movie has the same director as my favorite Pixar movie,",0.076489024
"and one of my favorite all time movies, ""Up"". Which probably explains why this movie isn't nearly as awful as some Pixar movies of recent have been. I mean it was just a slippery slope for some time. Representation: this unfortunately was a sore spot of the movie for me.",0.13848202
I dunno if it's because I've become more socially aware or what,0.058729365
but I just think there were,0.033518903
"so many missed opportunities where they could've slid in some diversity, be it racially, or from the LGBT plus community, into this movie. Where this movie left off a sequel would definitely be intriguing to me, but really only if they added some representation because that's definitely an area where kinds movie nowadays are slack in. Overall: this movie had great concepts, designs, and final pay off, in terms of characters and world building. Like its Pixar predecessors this movie is definitely severely lacking in diversity",0.18693414
"and I hope if there is a sequel it amends that. I recommend this movie to hardcore Pixar fans, if you need to see a movie with family, or someone who can't go into movies that are PG13 or over. Or if you enjoy crying over things like emotions and imaginary friends, like me. For an animated family feature I give ""Inside Out"" a B+. Also, for all my movie reviews, I will be putting trigger warnings down in my comments section so that you can be forewarned before you see the movie. So you can go check those out down below, as well as my other links blah, blah, blah, you get it by now. As always I'm The Filminist and I'll see you soon.",0.11325657
