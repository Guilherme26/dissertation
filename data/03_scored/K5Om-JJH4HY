and directed this joint and producer I always wonder how producer critics work in terms,0.091135114
of how much they have to put up for the movie and how much they,0.067224786
get paid when it does well I'm always wondering that like you know when you,0.14353345
when you produce so I know you're getting that bread but how much are you,0.11767112
putting up like the budget is 20 million did you put up to 20 million,0.101295024
oh you put up a fraction of that and then the other studios absorb some,0.09008315
of the calls too I always wondered that anyway that's neither here nor there that's,0.042990874
a different conversation yeah Jordan Peele man and Jordan Peele has everybody excited yeah he's,0.18113098
the new it director right now and his warranted get out was fantastic everybody loved,0.149287
it it was a game-changer you know the follower wheel a yes follow up let's,0.05689944
go an original idea in the original concept and since I'm doing the review late,0.07560293
it made 71 million dollars over the weekend which is the note to Hollywood people,0.057476755
want original stuff you don't have to remake everything you know say you don't have,0.11859015
this you'll have to give a sequel to every movie that made a little money,0.16931199
man original concepts can work as well that's not a shot to Halloween you know,0.19295223
I wanted to see Michael Myers again he was disappointed but still I respected him,0.08199617
coming back in the conjuring movies I would like to see another one but I'm,0.10060459
just saying like you know the original concept can work this this movie I don't,0.0840473
want to give too much away this is very like anything can spoil this movie,0.11508457
so it's gonna be a weird review but it's about a family that comes across,0.08570545
their doppelgangers and like the doppelgangers are you know they're not here on good terms,0.19324683
so it's like you know you're chilling with your family and then you see these,0.15096855
people that look exactly like you but they told you no saying you were out,0.1389474
here looking fresh to devil your doppelganger looking raggedy and look like he got ruffled,0.46293828
up in a coffee machine and then he just standing there looking at you and,0.09099141
it's like yo man this is creepy it's creepy man and that's what it's all,0.3283754
about how does this family survive the encounter with their you know raggedy doppelgangers or,0.108407155
in the movie they called the tether that's essentially what the movies about without giving,0.05945303
too much away it stars Lupita Nyong'o I don't know if I said her name,0.12430624
right she's an Academy Award winner she was in Star Wars she did voice work,0.07423651
for and she was also one of the stars and black panther and also her,0.0045282426
co-star that plays her husband in this play about Winston Dukes he was also a,0.11670751
scene stealer in black pants and it's funny those two met in college and acting,0.4009063
workshop so it's dope that they got to work together again on the professional to,0.15455495
making that money it was just dope to see from an acting standpoint us is,0.14244083
dope one of the takeaways from this movie is Lupita's acting skills it was just,0.2765822
incredible to see her play two different versions of herself and it's funny like when,0.08600834
you watch the movie the effects were so seamless on that you don't even notice,0.16556314
it you don't even realize it's the same people interacting with one of them like,0.15025383
I legit forgot no that's the same people you know say remembering Back to the,0.08401266
Future to when it was a big deal well they always bit-bit but you could,0.19088322
kind of see the special effects at work haci you know like when he threw,0.08398377
the the Almanac to the other side of the car you saw how fake the,0.24166214
Almanac looked on the tall silver but now you know they stepped it up a,0.0590504
little bit and in us is seamless and you know it was probably probably easier,0.122618824
because you know a lot of those scenes were darker so you can hide the,0.27338096
special effects within the dark scene but it was still dope but the acting though,0.10602959
Oh Lupita's act it was like two completely different people was the same person so,0.06568167
a lot of you know a lot of people compared to Toni Collette you know,0.08202465
performance in the red interior last year which I feel like she should have got,0.059427213
an Oscar nomination for I don't know why she didn't I started watching the favorite,0.08060955
with the lady that won Best Actress and I was like I turned it off,0.100824766
but did something like the the time period in the wardrobe with a favorite the,0.076811954
corsets and the big ridiculous hair and the women walking around like this just this,0.7742088
is some castles and just shooting ducks die anyway that's neither here nor there her,0.590372
performance was fired another takeaway from this movie man Jordan Peele it's just a shout,0.34985164
out to you know people that started in comedy like rooted in comedy improv comedy,0.19845082
sketches I just like to see that it just shows the versatility of funny people,0.08244941
like from the mind of Jordan Peele which many were introduced to him by a,0.062327776
sketch show like MADtv can't feel and now he's wish there was like creepy moving,0.3606723
this like yo the transition is dope now he's about to do the twilight zone,0.3217857
and it just goes to show that you know put your ideas forward man you,0.16920933
know don't worry about like nah nobody's gonna get it just do it just do,0.091344684
it and I hope he pops off is one of the major directors in the,0.14203344
game like you know like when tan Tito - the the n-word every five scenes,0.1508515
you know st. Quentin no st. you see it too much you write it too,0.15418768
much I should say so my review I can't really nitpick as if I mean,0.10335556
if I nitpick I'm a spoiler so I really need to do a spoiler review,0.0940031
for this movie but I'm not gonna do it but I enjoyed it like they,0.0992671
were creepy moments there were tense moments the acting really drew you in and then,0.18115267
this move this movie's gonna be polarizing a lot of people not gonna feel it,0.12987506
so if he was gonna feel it the people can get the underlying messages which,0.06527379
may or may not be there like this is a movie where you can kind,0.14981562
of interpret yourself and normally I'm not a fan of that but I went in,0.10132169
knowing that I went in knowing like it's probably gonna be some deeper level stuff,0.05349012
did we get a piece together ourselves so I was like all right okay I,0.08735367
was along for it I feel like it's a lot of Easter eggs within the,0.10616684
movie that will make you watch it again which is genius in itself so I,0.09597324
cared enough to watch it again you know what I mean so that's a plus,0.123737216
I'm like go for the acting man just go for the acting the creep factor,0.34051552
like it gives you something to think about when you leave the theater like when,0.1441487
I was driving to the airport I was thinking about the movie I was like,0.060795795

four saxophones I don't find ah what if I turned around I was like the,0.05536027
doppelganger of myself the tethered version of Tony Baker I just turn around like Joe,0.09062532
if you guys see movie yoni doing something that's alright man movies movies that have,0.086657934
like dual double characters of doppelgangers or whatever it's not that many movies that come,0.079867125
to mind I remember a movie with Drew Barrymore in the 90s called doppelganger and,0.07082835
