This movie started up so well and crashed and burned right in front of my face
"Oh goodness, so first offer after bad"
Anyone who tells you that this movie was amazing was great
"Um, they're lying to you"
I was expecting this wouldn't be good and it wasn't This is probably one of the worst Marvel Studios films that I've seen
"I would probably give that award to to Thor Ragnarok, But the redeeming Grace about Thor Ragnarok is that you know, Add the millions of jokes they had on display"
There were actually a couple that were funding that
"I kind of giggled that this, however, has all the bad of Thor Ragnarok, but without the humor there's the"
"I mean, there's like bits and pieces of humor where they tried, but it was just like"
"No, it was a Miss"
So let's get into it that the movie starts off amazing
"They tell the history of of Will Condign, how the Black Panther came to be, and all the five tribes and everything"
I'm just like Yo
this
This is
it was amazingly done
"I was like, You know, they managed to wrap all that up in about a few seconds"
I was like this movies about to be good
Marvel Studios comes on
So the movie starts off right
"It kind of like in the middle of of Civil War, where he hid where his father dies, and now he becomes king"
"Starts off with this scene, the process of process of how he becomes king, and it's very much kind of like how it's done in the jungle with the lines where you know if he had the headline and if no one challenges the headline"
"Well, he remains the headline"
"If someone challenges him, and you know, and he went well, This guy's a new"
"The new headline, The head of the head of the head of the the tribe, Or if he concedes well, then he remains the headline"
"It's usually to the death, based off the you know the Discovery Channel"
"So what happens is they ask all the tribes Bhiwandi, You know, Do we have a challenger to Chawla? Everyone concedes No, we don't have a challenge"
"No, we don't have a challenger, and one the other"
"When the other tribes are the mountain, they have a challenger, so they fight it out, and T'challa ends up winning just by an inch by inch"
He wins and he becomes king
"Now when it comes to the costume, I know I was bitching and moaning about the costume and you know what it? After seen the movie"
I don't have a problem with the new costume and the reason why is because we barely see it
"There is a problem with Marvel films, and this was most pertinent in the Spider-man series is where they have every five seconds, they have to remove the super ass"
Remove his mask
I'm like Yo
I didn't come here to see the actor
I came here to see Black Panther Every five seconds
You know his
"He's taking off his mask, whether it's digital or he's constantly removing it"
"So when it comes to the action in this movie, you would think for a movie titled Black Panther, we would see more of the Black Panther in action"
"Um, sadly we do"
not
I think there's like maybe four for action pieces
The first part is the one where he's in the jungle that was horribly filmed
"I understand that it's black and that his suit is black, so that makes it hard for bad people to see him, but as an audience member that makes it hard for me to see him as well"
So it's black on black on black
"Literally, and I'm like I don't know what's going on in the theater"
I don't know what's what's happening on screen
I can't see anything
One thing I do like about the film is that you know everyone is strong
"Everyone has a sense of pride in a sense of character, Like he goes in to save this girl that he likes, which, in the trailer they said you know, don't freeze"
"He, of course freezes in front of her, you know, like his crush or whatever, but she, you know, as soon as she gets that second to escape captivity, she does and she's paying on Bam, like these women are trained"
"As a matter of fact, My favorite character throughout the entire movie wasn't even to Chala"
"It has to be his his guard, the the bald headed woman, who's like the protector, like she is more dedicated to Wakanda than he is, And she's more of a strong and justjust a strong and powerful character"
"Like how she's I don't even say how she's written, but how she's portrayed on screen how she does it"
It's like help You do not want to mess with this woman
"I'd rather see her as Black Panther Ten to Charla, and I'm gonna tell you why, As I go on in this review, So the whole story arc of Black Panther is surrounds about Jordan, P"
Jordan B's character in Jordan
"These characters, essentially two Challahs father on his brother, goes to America, sleeps with a woman"
Apparently the white woman
"Because Jordan, he's pretty light and has Jordan B's character"
"The child's father comes, comes to America and confronts him because you know Jordan B's father was selling vibranium and Jordan B's father his whole ideas"
"You know, we need to rise up, You know, we need to supply all the blacks with weaponry that we have, and we need to control the world, and then by our hand we give out justice"
That's what he wants
He wants to control the world
"So long story short, Andy's character makes his way back to Wakanda"
"I'm not sure how he makes his way back to Wakanda, Because who he was dependent upon on finding his way there? Um, he kills"
And that was Andy Serkis character
"The claws he straight, kills him before he even gets the directions to Wakanda"
Whatever will bypass that she
"Jordan B comes back to a condom with Andy Serkis, his character, The Claw, I'm dead"
"He lays it at the the doorsteps of Wakanda, So the big thing about Andy Serkis is character claw, is that T'challa was supposed to be going to America to get Claude to bring him back in order to serve justice"
"It's in order for his trial to be had, And you know he promises one of the other members of the tribe who Klaw killed"
He killed
"I think of is his family his mother, father or something like that"
He's like Yo
"Are you gonna bring him back Because every one every black panther, including you is said, They're gonna do something"
They have it
"And to tell us like I got you, I got you"
I'm gonna bring him back and he's gonna serve you no justice
"I promise you that he comes up in D, empty-handed Right"
he comes back
"Sorry, he slipped through my hands"
"Um, which is why it makes it so important that Jordan, be"
He ends up killing him and brings him back to a kind of like
"You know, I brought him back"
Your King can do it
I did
"she draw in B's characters like I want the throne and I want to fight you in order to get the throne, because that's how it's done and you know touch Allah accepts"
"Thing is, Apparently you can challenge the king at any point in time, regardless of when they're having the tournament or not, but whatever that's neither here or there, so they get to fighting right, and in Jordan B's character he wins"
"Now, listen to me, he wins"
He ends up killing T'Challa
"He's them, picks him up and throws him off"
He went
He's rightfully the king
everyone's devastated all
"Oh my God, he's the king"
I can't believe this
We've got to do something about
"We got to do something about this and I'm like, Wait, what do you? What do you mean? You have to do something about this by your own rules that you have in place"
He rightfully won
I'd understand a few
"Was he did something fair, He be had the you know Black Panthers power prior to the fight, Um, but no, he fair and square one"
So I don't so bake
"They're completely about to undermine everything, Old Black Panthers history, the culture, the heritage, All that undermine it all because they don't like who rightfully is in power"
"Not only that but Jordan, B"
"You said you know that the flour that they take it in order to become to get the powers of the Black Panther Jordan Be is like he'll burn it, burn it all, and she's like, Look, we can't do that"
"He's like you know, Don't you ever? holes are up"
"bad throws like, Don't you ever tell me what I can and can't do? I'm King, You burn it all so they burn it all, and I'm thinking to myself, you want to tell me, the most advanced country on the face of the planet has no contingency within their constitution in regards to stopping or thwarting a dictatorship"
That's what you want to tell me
"Ok, then I start thinking about it"
"I'm like, Hold up all the kings and power"
All they've managed to demonstrate that they
they have a physical ability of physical superiority over everyone else
That's it
That's all you
"That's all it is you have to do, nor they continue to become a super hero"
Is Orange is the the fight
That's it
"There's no, you know, tests of mine, No wisdom, none of that, just you just have to"
"you, just have to be physically more domineering than everyone else"
I'm like Yo
That's this Point Blank game
"stupid and the reason why it's stupid is case in Point Gordon, B's character"
"So moving on, the mountain tribe defines a two Challahs body and they have them in preservation"
"The family, you know, Chitara and the sister and everything, and his girlfriend all leave and go to the tribe"
"Go to the mountain king, and they, they offer him"
"They offer him the the powers of the Black Panther, So they are really just crapping on everything That what Wakanda in the Black Panther stands for"
They're about to offer a rival tribe of the powerful Black Panther
so the dude is like Yo
come here
Let me show you like
Here's here's your king
Here's the child
"This is who he is, So they give to child, The The, the medicine of the super powers of the Black Panther, And he wakes up and everything he's like"
Yo
"okay, Simon"
Settle things
"I'm like, Hold up"
Hold up here
You can't give him the medicine of the Black Panther because he lost
technically by law he should be dead
That's that's it
So this whole idea about what Condor forever we understand from Akanda
"it's all bull crap because you don't care about what Conda or the laws that they have in place, or the culture, because you don't like it that the man that you wanted to win when the win, the fight, and all that is now dethroned, is now essentially dead, so you guys are willing to to bypass everything history, history of your people, in order to put this man to Chala back in power"
And T'challa isn't really that big of a king
He's not
even
He's a weak King
"In my opinion, they managed to cut to China, because throughout the history throughout the film they're battling with this"
"this idea of you know, I move a condo or more advanced"
"We should be able to help people of other countries, help our people who are in the country, And we're 2 tallis, like y'all know, that's that's not our job"
That's our responsibility
I am king of two
I'm king of Wakanda and my job is for the Wakandan people
I have no problem
I get that he's absolutely right
"But even if he did want to help other people, war, or less privileged than him, then he, you know there's other means to do it"
"You just don't cuz in the movie In the movie, I know I'm jumping ahead so so going back to where I was, T'challa comes back and join me, Peterson"
"He's like Yo, did the fight"
all of that determining who's King
That's all over
To tell us I go
I'm still alive and I didn't concede I didn't concede
"So the battle so long, So they did the Queen, that, not the Queen, The the the warrior"
"Later, She's like Yo"
Did
The fight is still on
Technically by the law of the land
"By our law, the fight is along"
Jordan B's character looks to the dude
Remember the the tribe guy who got his parents killed by cloth? He looks at him as like Yo kill T'Challa The Duke goes and does it
"I'm like there's nobody care about the law or what Conda in the Black Panther tribe like, Oh, this is just like just a free-for-all All it takes is one person"
I'm just like this is crazy
"This is Magnus, Because technically the fight should still be on"
They should have their fight and make it happen
"This do goes off and starts fighting Uh, T'Challa and their tribe, So there's absolute craziness on-screen So because you had this whole tribe trying to fight a T'Challa and to Charles, defending and trying to stop the ships from going out, Because Jordan B is like Yo Sind"
Send the weaponry through Vance wedding ring to these people
We have spies in every country
Send them out and let's get this revolution started
"and to child's like, No, you can't have that"
So he's trying to stop them while fighting the tribe and all of this And then I'm just like then they have
"I kid you, not, they bring out Cgi rhinos and they have rhinos attacking their own people, So I'm like Yo, did the director - the scriptwriter"
Do they not think this through? They had black people attacking black people
I'm like even Oma conduct this black-on-black crime
"Come on, so the fight slows down and - child's sister starts fighting torn beasts, character in the child sister and as his love interest, and Jordan B is in the middle of about to kill - child sister T'Challa, That's when he jumps"
"He's like No, and he stops him and then we"
we are
we are
just words can't describe
just that
The the weakness of this film
It is so all the hype that was put behind this film
This climax scene between Jordan B's character and T'challa It's just that it was so just just we cuckoo came up with this
This is this fight scene was garbage
"I was severely upset watching this fight scene, so wrapping this all up"
"Jordan, Be a character ends up dying how, I have no idea, Cuz, the last time I checked the Black Panther potion tears you of any of any harm or any bruises or scars or wounds"
"It cures you, so I'm like you have superpowers so I'm not sure how he dies"
Whatever they let him die
"We wrapping this up, We're wrapping this up and T'Challa comes out"
He goes to the Un
He's like Yo
we're here
We're gonna help
"Basically he's talking about build bridges, not walls"
"All this whoopty whoop, all this crap"
I'm like
hold up
"No, no, no, no, no, no, No, you want to tell me because his girl, his, his love in trees is like"
Kill Makanda
Is fall enough to protect ourselves and help others
I'm like
obviously the hell you aren't
You had one person drawing these character
one guy completely undermine everything completely
"Oh, just turn your whole country upside down on its head"
"One person you want to tell me that a country that the entire nation finds out that Africa has this vibranium, most, one, the most powerful, and you know, allies resources of the world, don't the planet, And then you're just gonna sit idly by and let what conduct hand it out"
"Well, you get this and we're gonna help you here"
"No, of course, not, that's gonna start a war"
"So like the hell with Wakanda and all that, And as I was saying about the child being a weak-ass leader, he is a weak-ass leader"
"They, they freaking cocked"
I can't believe what I'm saying
"They come, they manage to cook the Black Panther, they manage to cut one the strongest most Alpha characters in the Marvel Universe"
They manage to cut this man
"This dude was all about him and his people, and making sure they survive And they cut this dude because he's not even a strong enough character"
A he barely wins the first fight
the second fight he dies
he loses that fight
"The only way even comes back if it was through the power of of them, just completely crapping on the laws of the land"
So I'm like I eat all of this and then he goes and just leaves open his people
"talking about bridges, not walls to two possible attacks, inevitable attacks"
"This movie was garbage, just straight garbage"
"Anyone who talks about this movie being great and everything, you have no sense of taste, you have no respect for yourself and you're just saying it because it's Black Panther Anyways, guys, that's the video limit"
"Oh, you guys see one that I"
You enjoy the film or not? You thought it was garbage
like I did
"Um, either, Or hope you guys enjoyed the video"
"If you did, please feel free to like share"
"comment, subscribe all that fun stuff till next time guys be amazing"
Even OMA conduct this black-on-black crime
Come on
