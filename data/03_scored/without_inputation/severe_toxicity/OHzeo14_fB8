cast was really great and includes four Oscar winners Robert DeNiro Al Pacino Joe Pesci,0.030741462
and Anna Paquin I really like Anna and I was expecting to see more of,0.025423318
her she I think has one line in the entire movie and she mostly just,0.052266806
kind of looks and stares so that seemed like a waste of talent for her,0.1888024
but anyway it was still nice to see her in the movie and the other,0.073889926
three that I just mentioned phenomenal and I hadn't seen Joe Pesci in anything in,0.030066965
quite a while so I just loved to seeing him other standouts are Bobby Cannavale,0.21102685
E Steven Van Sant Harvey Keitel Ray Romano Jesse Plemons and a million more Italians,0.046324056
in Hollywood rumor has it that Joe Pesci actually refused this role more than 50,0.026110454
times because he didn't want to come out of retirement but I'm so glad he,0.019925576
did he is just outstanding I already said that Ray Liotta however is missing in,0.021595187
the movie I don't know if he got an invitation or not but he should,0.054698717
have been I really liked him and he would have been perfect in this movie,0.047692336
it was also really fascinating to learn about some of the real-life people and how,0.12856337
everything was connected and how things might have gone down of course we still don't,0.020717809
know the facts of everything so it was just an interesting perspective and it could,0.01229858
have easily happened this way I'm always in summary impressed with the technology that makes,0.012475519
actors look younger so the special effects were just amazing they were provided by Industrial,0.034325473
Light and Magic and that was half the fun was watching some of these older,0.038488857
actors go back in time they're actually Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro actually speak,0.073722966
Italian in the movie with no subtitles or at least than the one that I,0.06879396
saw there were no subtitles they talked about the war and then they quickly transition,0.05268853
to English but the Italian sounded pretty good and gave a really nice authentic flare,0.055476315
I thought it was super interesting to read on the screen how various people in,0.031112636
the Mafia were found dead not at the very end of the movie although there's,0.21717049
a little bit of that but during the movie as new characters are introduced it'll,0.014786367
say on the screen found shot dead 14 times in the head or the heart,0.50108033
or whatever and I was just like whoa so that was kind of a really,0.041999694
interesting and actually kind of a cool element that I really liked it the music,0.024279868
was perfect set the tone although there was one song that they played over and,0.022620235
over again whatever now some things that I didn't like and this list is very,0.0137453545
short first of all the movie is really really long too long I think some,0.051899623
things could have easily been cut out some people say oh not a minute was,0.07342164
wasted it was perfection and actually there was some talk that they were going to,0.031016849
turn this into a two-part series which I think would have been good or better,0.034791764
for the average viewer it's just really really long this is actually the longest film,0.032619275
ever directed by Martin Scorsese and the longest feature film released in over 20 years,0.008815679
it took 106 days to film also the longest shooting of Scorsese Scorsese's career and,0.067341864
so another item was that there's some jumping back back and forth quite a bit,0.038039193
from past a present that might confuse viewers and then the only other pro are,0.014406547
the only other thing that I didn't care for was just so much profanity for,0.047713622
me it's just exhausting to sit through all of that I want to see the,0.06735184
art and of course it represents how they they would have spoken back then but,0.024543947
