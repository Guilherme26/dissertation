according to the library of congress the wizard of oz is the most watched movie,0.059476603
of all time which makes sense because it's over 80 years old was one of,0.050164513
the first movies to be released in color and presents a timeless story with iconic,0.044756472
characters and songs it reminds me of the animated features that would be released by,0.041632462
walt disney which is a reasonable comparison because this was made as a direct response,0.070363425
to walt disney's snow white in the seven dwarfs for something that had production troubles,0.18274093
and a less than stellar box office performance it's amazing that the wizard of oz,0.10213979
has remained in the pop culture discussion so as a person who constantly talks about,0.09600364
movies it's about time i talk about this 1939 victor fleming classic that everybody has,0.09921741
already referenced at this point you've always had the power to go back to kansas,0.14576422
excuse me why didn't you tell her before because she wouldn't have believed me are,0.16381834
you out of your mind and i think i'll miss you most of all scarecrow,0.6388895
oh okay it's kind of an odd thing to say yeah sort of a weird,0.31089434
comment right in front of all of us kind of thought this was a team,0.07980605
effort yeah dorothy is accompanied only by a batch of what can ultimately be called,0.08522168
fully emasculated male figures a fragile impotent lion an effeminate scarecrow a fae tin man,0.6364068
a brain a heart my own apartment and what was her sister a princess the,0.24936162
wizard of oz and like i said at the beginning everyone has already watched and,0.05075033
talked about this movie before every person has seen this important cinematic triumph right i,0.116676114
feel like this makes an appearance in everybody's childhood but there's not too many who,0.06585915
return to it with a new perspective as an adult my journey to oz has,0.08979519
changed over time obviously i loved it as a kid it had its creepy moments,0.28091547
the unforgettable songs the memorable makeup i lived near the judy garland museum in grand,0.08994492
rapids minnesota and visited it more than once one time the living munchkin actors were,0.2786994
signing autographs and meeting people the ruby slippers would be given to the museum every,0.09091048
summer until they were mysteriously stolen they've since been found but the fbi still hasn't,0.1306395
released the full details of that story i vividly remember when scooby-doo came out in,0.104259424
2002 we were at the theater in grand rapids and a terrible tornado-like storm was,0.08560022
rolling through reminiscent of the movie and just across the street there was the judy,0.07326862
garland house i really felt like we were going to be taken away to oz,0.15530367
like a lot of viewers i held on to my early memories but never gave,0.07484961
it another watch until we did a section on populism for a civics class in,0.07309008
high school because it's been argued that the whole film is a populist allegory watching,0.07363199
it again it feels like things dragged a lot more than i remembered some of,0.09847042
the effects felt pretty cheap and some things felt plain stupid like at one point,0.7047873
the lion gets a second solo song number but the scarecrow and tin man only,0.19309828
got one but what's that all about was it part of bert lars contract was,0.056132134
he that impressive of a singer well 80 years later it just leaves people puzzled,0.11629012
the monkeys were dumb the run time felt long and the whole charade felt like,0.61109316
a huge plot hole why didn't glenda just tell dorothy to use the shoe's magic,0.24060304
to wish herself home all along this was a kids movie for sure and it,0.11518211
was only intended for kids i wasn't as cynical as a lot of teenagers become,0.26282737
but my reaction to the wizard of oz was a low point for me i,0.07867481
have revisited it multiple times since if not yearly in fact it happens to be,0.08061393
on my fiance's list of favorite films and our first date was catching a re-release,0.07506364
of it in theaters so i know this one very well from knowing that the,0.047018517
actor who was going to play the tin man was replaced because he was allergic,0.28285047
to the makeup to the gun the scarecrow is holding in one shot now in,0.44266325
crystal clear high definition and before you ask no i don't think an actor playing,0.0902233
a munchkin hung themself that was caught on camera it's a crane a living bird,0.47540662
on set you can easily see it on anything that's not a vhs from a,0.09916587
technical standpoint the wizard of oz is a marvel to look at so many interesting,0.051478058
techniques were done to bring this world to life but to push themselves even further,0.18447024
they expanded the use of the technicolor process while making it an integral part of,0.055334605
the story the opening scenes take place in kansas in sepia tone a stylized looking,0.06063904
black and white but in oz everything becomes color and to achieve this shot they,0.020343728
actually had a stunt double in a sepia tone dress in the house painted in,0.06254892
brown and white and when she opens the door to us judy garland walks into,0.045527242
frame as a fully realized color dorothy it's moments like this that make you appreciate,0.10886247
the work that they went to for what amounts to about 10 seconds of screen,0.10219826
time especially when they have this silly edited cut only a few minutes later they're,0.6842851
gone the makeup is still out of this world i can't believe this is only,0.11682231
1939 because i somehow perfected the look of these characters so much it makes me,0.07525896
wonder why even modern cinema can't make the fantasy designs look as good as they,0.06055162
do here the scarecrow makeup in particular looks almost like a potato sack you'd see,0.55462855
in a real life scarecrow i still can't comprehend how it was done the story,0.17920567
is classic the traditional journey where out of this world personalities are met along the,0.078085124
way it takes a simple idea and invests all of its worth into telling it,0.09428593
well everyone has distinct charisma this was at a time when hollywood was really into,0.054020904
the waltz and tap dancing popcorn flicks which oz takes a lot of inspiration from,0.059322633
yet with the backgrounds and this set design things never feel dated even some of,0.062911585
the cheesier effects have a charm to them that fit the tone of everything else,0.11462915
and even if it's noticeable there's at least 10 other great special effects to follow,0.0605282
it up with that will blow your mind this utilizes pyrotechnics miniatures forced perspective animatronics,0.24072981
wires and so much more it transports you in a way that very few movies,0.10667652
have been able to replicate the songs are good but i have a few comments,0.06229485
the opening number has become a staple of american culture but i probably prefer nearly,0.14870578
every other cover of this song rather than the original judy garland is good don't,0.07222174
get me wrong but this is the only performance that feels of the time the,0.11530689
munchkinland melody is rapid and bouncy hopping between different styles and vocals as a huge,0.11229055
portion of the backstory is explained through song it's the moment where the munchkins really,0.11346769
get to shine and for becoming such big icons in their own right you kind,0.11209432
of forget that this is the only scene where they appear if i only had,0.06513953
a brain works for the different characters who replaced brain with heart or nerve but,0.35838228
i'm not really a fan of king of the forest like i said just feels,0.06291259
a bit overblown for an actor in a movie that wasn't really about showcasing the,0.15154684
famous actors and their talents at the time we're off to see the wizard is,0.036471795
of course the most addictive piece ever created and must be saying anytime you're with,0.15037951
a group of friends walking in a horizontal lineup the witch still freaks me out,0.6597433
to this day there's something about that extremely green skin and the voice that terrifies,0.17343669
me more than any horror villain would finding out that margaret hamilton was a schoolteacher,0.24202152
doesn't really help to improve things think about it would you want this actress disciplining,0.11013502
you in the 1930s the wizard was really disturbing as a kid too even with,0.22291246
the reveal of the true man behind the curtain i still couldn't forget that floating,0.098300084
alien looking head where did they even come up with that design surprisingly a lot,0.18024965
of the humor still works today and there's even a few things that only an,0.071926326
older audience would notice like the fortune teller in kansas who's obviously duping dorothy into,0.06245972
running back home you also notice that the kansas farmers look an awful lot like,0.24048983
the actors who played the main characters in oz there's things that just make you,0.05407385
laugh that may not be intentional like how matter-of-fact glenda is after the wicked witch,0.589134
of the east is killed she has such a bubbly personality even though a murder,0.5907678
just occurred when they get out of the poppy field this old timey boppity music,0.117857136
starts up and the characters stop and start dancing along as if they can also,0.07971862
hear it is it's not just for the audience or does the music play for,0.02849599
anyone who's entering the city of oz it's not as funny when you realize that,0.10634605
that snow in the background is actually asbestos and of course by far the best,0.07383666
part is that epic window jump the lion does he runs down the longest hallway,0.10880388
in existence breaks through the glass of the window and it fades to black we,0.10330142
don't even see what happens or if he gets injured they just cut to the,0.25411344
next scene i'm kind of surprised this turned out as perfect as it did it,0.111952856
had quite a few interesting production tidbits like the tin man actor who got replaced,0.2483242
dorothy starting out with a blonde wig and margaret hamilton sustaining third-degree burns from a,0.24016942
failed pyrotechnic stunt the craziest part is the number of directors they went through they,0.3779863
started out with norman tarag who did some of the test footage he was replaced,0.15908445
by richard thorpe who only shot for nine days and shot the only footage of,0.37855563
buddy epson as the tin man he was replaced by george cuccor after mervyn leroy,0.40311077
was unhappy with the footage but kukor left after only making a few creative choices,0.10226031
at this point most of the finished shots had to be redone and victor fleming,0.1188287
came in so kukor could go back to working on gun with the wind fleming,0.24252497
is the final credited director but to my surprise as of this writing i discovered,0.047333617
yet another director came on after fleming left to replace kukor again on of all,0.09065162
things gone with the wind king vidor only directed some of the kansas scenes but,0.1096075
in total the wizard of oz had four directors they should make a movie just,0.046726845
about the making of this movie regardless this is a 5 out of 5 star,0.13184799
movie if you ask me and the themes are effective even today i guess you,0.06498015
can call it simplistic with its morals but i think that's why they remain timeless,0.091135316
the gifts received at the end are not what the characters were specifically seeking but,0.05180695
they represent everything gained from the journey including knowledge kindness and courage the gifts are,0.034280185
only tokens possessed by the types of people they aspire to be but along the,0.15016198
way they already achieved them the idea of there being no place like home has,0.09609504
become a comforting sentiment i don't think it really means that a person should never,0.082827196
go beyond the world they've grown up in dorothy already went on the journey even,0.07713723
if it's considered a dream but after all the excitement it's good to relax in,0.052288033
a setting you're familiar with how do i recommend something that everyone's already seen well,0.092338316
if it's been a few years i say go watch it again you might be,0.12561421
surprised by just how good it still is and there might be a few things,0.07659095
that you catch that i haven't even caught yet some of those smaller details if,0.1443261
you're a fan of cinema that uses special effects to tell its story this is,0.13061911
a must watch just like mary poppins blade runner willy wonka movies that utilize a,0.10620193
wide range of different special effects wizardry they have a huge debt to pay to,0.05480305
