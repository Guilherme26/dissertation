Welcome back to my channel today
"On my channel, I'll be reviewing a quiet place"
"A quiet place is a 2018 American horror film directed by John Krasinski from a screenplay by Brian Wood, Scott Beck and Krasinski based on a story by Woods and Bek"
the film follows a family who must live their life in silence while hiding from creatures which hunt exclusively by sound
"Despite all the film's praise, I tried my best to keep my expectations low"
"This was mostly because I was fearing it turning into another don't breathe scenario where everyone loves it so hard that I'm expecting something amazing, and then when I finally get to watch it, I end up hating it with a fiery passion"
"That being said, there were many things I enjoy about this film, though ultimately I was not nearly as enamored by it as much as the public seemed to be"
"From the moment the film began, I found its filming choices quite for hitting"
"I knew I was going into a film that moreso, the time was going to lack sound"
"But even though I knew this, I wasn't expecting the extent in many films"
"Even when there is an absence of dialogue, there is still background noise or even a score to keep the audience engaged"
When this film begins
there is nothing
It is so quiet
"I honestly felt something was wrong with the copy I was watching, but everything was just fine"
"It was impressive to see how far in they were willing to go, and how far they would take the concept"
The slightest noise
"even so much as a pin dropping means death, and for that reason they take every precaution to avoid any and all sound"
Watching this inaction was deafening
"It was a shock to my senses and made me very uncomfortable, which meant it was doing its job, and for that reason I was hooked"
"When the film surprises you with the burst of sound you feel the level of alarm and panic and induces, and it is perfectly acted out in our performers faces that instant, feel where your mind races with all the ways this moment could turn out, but the most important being will you survive? I felt these moments were inserted very smartly and sporadically they weren't one after another, which would have been overkill and not fit the tone of the film"
"The cinematography I found was quite simple, but in this case simple works perfect"
For what maybe is you're already doing something incredible when it comes to sound
"You're so strongly focused on how to utilize one sense that I think if they had amped up the visuals, it would have just become a sensory"
"Emily Blunt, for me, is the standout performer of this film"
"While I felt everyone did a phenomenal job, she of course took it to a whole other level"
"There is a lot of range to her character, fear, pain, determined, protective, loving, and seeing her act out each of these things was just incredible"
I was truly blown away by what she brought to this film
"As for Millicent Simmons, while her breakthrough role was in 2017, so wonderstruck, her role in this film and what this film represents when it comes to the hearing impaired community is a breakthrough"
all in itself
It's really great to see Minority Act as being given more roles
"And what I liked in this film is that usually when you see an actor with an impairment on screen, the character is very obviously part of the minority and they stand out from everyone else and are almost depicted as abnormal, But amidst, despite her condition, she's not depicted as abnormal at all"
"Due to the circumstances, she's very much like everyone else"
"While she can't hear and doesn't speak, she's not made to feel different because no one else is able to speak, and therefore there is nothing to hear most of the time"
I found that quite interesting to witness
I was surprised by how many people were killed in this movie
I honestly wasn't expecting everyone to die
"I was thinking it would be one of those movies where it's all about the suspense and the anticipation of death, but no actual death"
"So when it happens, I was quite stunned and again impressed"
"However, I was not impressed with the creatures themselves and I did feel we were exposed to them true soon, and that took away a lot of the suspense"
"For me, I felt their appearance was true over the top for a film with such a simple style"
The final confrontation with them did remind me a fair bit of signs you think everyone screwed
but in the last second they figure out the one thing that can kill them that no one was able to figure out their appearance
I was expecting something I'd never seen before
"That these creatures honestly look like a venom and the truth, Fairies from Hellboy had a baby"
"So because it felt reminiscent of another, I wasn't very impressed by them"
"There was some what I would consider convenient plot points that were inserted into the film, and I personally find it aggravating when anything is done for the sake of convenience"
Especially in a horror movie
It just lowers the quality for me because it feels lazy
"For example, the scene with the nail I felt was unnecessary"
"We already have the character going into labor and trying to be quiet about it, which is next to impossible"
And this was Blunt standout moment of the film
"For me, I imagine that's much like what Scientology is like"
"Point is, this moment was stressful enough and I'm sure could have still led to making noise"
So the addition of the nail bit
I was unimpressed with the silo scene
"I felt again, added an unnecessary moment to the film"
The entire circumstances of the film are intense and dangerous enough
"So inserting this scene that was about, how can we up the danger factor again, I felt was pushing it"
My other issue was found in the final scene when they realized the creatures weakness and they use it to fight back
this
I also found a bit convenient
I'm not sure how all the scribbles on the walls and the newspaper articles everywhere allowed her to piece together what their weakness was and how she could utilize it
She did seem to figure that out abnormally fast and piece it together in a way I just don't understand
"So while the logic of what their weakness is, I think is perfect and makes total sense how they discovered it in that moment I didn't find believable"
I'm also trying to piece together where the creatures come from from the newspaper clippings
"I assume they appeared from a meteor or asteroid that was mentioned, but I'm not sure"
If so
"that would again make them aliens, and would once again remind me of science"
"Overall, there was a lot that I was impressed with, and I am certainly blown away with how this film uses sound and the absence of sound to create a story, and how they depicted it was incredible"
"and as I mentioned, the performances were stellar, but there are still things about this film"
I was not impressed with it being a horror film
I never felt scared or even really felt that suspenseful
"and when moments reminded me of other films, what little suspense I was feeling was instantly diminished, so these elements had zero impact on me"
"I honestly only jumped once, and it was because the dad popped up out of nowhere prior to seeing it"
I felt a sequel was ridiculous Having now seen it
"I do see how the ending lends itself to a sequel, but I personally don't feel it needs one"
After the success of this
"I don't believe a sequel will match what this has done and will just end up as another staple that is there to make money, but contributes absolutely nothing"
ultimately still a solid film
