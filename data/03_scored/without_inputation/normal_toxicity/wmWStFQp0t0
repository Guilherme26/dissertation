hello and welcome to the flick advisory today we're going to review Logan now Logan is directed by james mangold Logan is said to be the final portrayal of the character Wolverine by Hugh Jackman,0.070044115
this is the ninth time he's played the character I'm starting with 2000s x-men action was really the first time at least 20 Century,0.100668274
Fox kind of took the comic book movie seriously x-men kind of redefine the comic book genre,0.16222245
they're the first ones who really put a lot into the comic book movies I've seen they could actually be more than just silly comic book movies if you go back to that first x-men that I protection actually touched a lot about the political and social issues,0.49314976
I'm all being under the veil of mutants versus people,0.2968782
but the whole movie is really a civil rights movie,0.07484552
you know,0.07163658
if you think about civil rights communes,0.10663876
so starring hugh jackman Patrick Stewart returns as Professor X Xavier and introducing Daphne keen as Laura I'm also knows x-23 hey why not okay x-23 is a clone of Wolverine that they got wrong 22 times then they decided to try to make it a female,0.19455592
you know playing around the chromosomes and filing the 23rd attempt to make a Wolverine clone it works,0.09701616
oh I can't much like you know one of the things you want to take note is that this movie is loosely based off of the the comic book old man Logan,0.25106716
it's loosely based because there are elements that the movie can't take away from the soy,0.08503973
and then the elements of the movie doesn't take away from that particular story that story has the all the Marvel,0.07278497
now all of a model,0.0656298
but that story has Marvel elements and Marvel properties that 20 accessory box cannot use such as the whole Hawkeye those things belong to Marvel Studios you know in their original series and stuff like that and so 20th Century Fox took the old man Logan feel and adapted it into a story that they could actually use with their properties I'm so you know there is no Wolverine finding the hoax you know children those things don't happen in this sir,0.1090393
there's no blind Hawkeye driving wolverine around,0.091816
so in that sense is there an immediate adaptation of old man Logan,0.24898171
it's more of a rethinking or loosely based off of that,0.06477757
so here,0.058199726
you have Logan he's an old man,0.45911327
he's an old man,0.44132847
you know,0.07163658
imagine,0.04992532
you know Charles Xavier now a really old man,0.24081784
this matter of fact he's kind of going see,0.08938428
now he's got dementia or Alzheimer's,0.44658768
he has a degenerative,0.49188492
you know the kind of brain disease here,0.72935104
and Logan is taking care of him,0.1109473
they have so like a father-son relationship,0.17508674
almost all the other x-men are gone,0.27809158
they kind of a little to a reason about why that's happening we'll get into that later,0.10033612
so it's really just Xavier and Logan full of full majority,0.09056357
the movie until lower comes along Laura needs help getting to this other place with these other kind of upcoming mutants are like a safe haven for them anytime,0.15105033
you are come on come on everyone has come along,0.2489286
now a lot of the things in this move we work really really well as talk about those things the direction in this movie the tone they decide to take,0.07169374
this is a this be first rated,0.08181978
our x-men movie are you can say Deadpool,0.13532752
if you want through Dipple is a raid on comic book movie and he is kind of an excellent Your Honor me,0.4069709
but this is actually something that we've been waiting for for a long time it was nice to see Wolverine on the screen back in two thousand it was just it was just a neat thing and it has been cool ever since but you kind of wanted a little bit more you kind of want of the edginess of that particular character to really come through and they tried it a little bit before with 2013 the Wolverine with james mangold also directed it tries to bring you a more ground in a more serious a more mature wolverine character,0.10599867
and after the release of Deadpool which was rated r 20 Century Fox decided they could take a chance and tell a more mature adult Wolverine story and so here they had to take that and run with it at a rated r level and for that the movie doesn't hold back,0.056808397
and let me give you everything you something,0.11416765
we've been waiting to see you know for the last,0.07777913
what 17 years you know when Wolverine you know stab somebody you're selected that somebody with this cause,0.4512275
you know finally actual blood comes out,0.31089434
hey you know,0.059623145
it's not that clean clip they clean cut album,0.1541773
you know what would you slice it you cut all right of the wound,0.35614723
at the exact same time,0.055523068
we got to a point where I was almost like insulting our intelligence,0.38697165
so we finally get the blood on this,0.37206882
and another thing this movie just hurts there's movie physically and emotionally hurts,0.15469329
they bring you along with these characters,0.07005919
you know you've already known you know Wolverine Logan you already know professor extra,0.10834459
now you get to really spend a lot of time with them because it's mostly them before the other x-men movie here you're sharing screen time with real storm Jean Grey rogue,0.2155399
you know Cyclops,0.09586548
do you know all these other characters,0.07212942
finally we get to sit down with really the characters we've enjoyed the most and to spend time with them and fill for them and let them take you along the ride,0.15064904
if some when bad things happen to them,0.108484216
and there's allows bad things that haven't told in this movie when bad things happen to him you'd get there and it hurts you,0.10977889
it is sort of an emotionally draining movie almost like,0.16280803
I said with my princess review as even as a movie you're just high you need somebody to help you out of the seat because you're exhausted and it's a good thing,0.19907369
I mean it's effective storytelling,0.08423345
it's good acting,0.06679665
it's a good direction,0.056921043
I was good writing Hugh Jackman against us as well he's got to know this role by the bathroom,0.2020873
you know like the back of his hand by at this point,0.117430456
you know plane is character nine different times but he actually brings it to a whole nother level this time because Wolverines out of place in his life that he hasn't been before there's no more glitz and glamour,0.11008125
there's no more team,0.08539442
even though he wasn't the biggest team players,0.08913314
there's no real team to fall back on none of that is just hear,0.06972701
my professor actually trying to take care of them and Professor X,0.24039093
you know Charles Xavier and you know Patrick Stewart playing him again gives another outstanding performance um,0.09692179
he's an old man even-even older man,0.5530119
he's beginning to go see now so but you know somebody who hazards of you know uh who's going through this,0.14846487
you understand what a bad day is for them,0.4032382
you know they don't remember you were you trying to tell them,0.091900505
hey you know this happened back in the day,0.06253249
they're like,0.046801094
I'll remember that,0.021384029
but no when Charles Xavier has a bad day you know with the mind that he has when that mine such a deteriorate,0.14967147
it's not just a bad day for him,0.15141742
that's a bad day for everybody in like a five-mile radius when I try to think about things that don't work in this movie I really I nothing really comes across you would,0.15352678
think maybe the thing you know the child actor Daphne King,0.24030434
you'll think maybe you know sushi or the one below and the movie she works really,0.13701336
well she gives things across a lot of times without dialogue you do believe her as this savage now know now you know somebody confronts her you're kind of expecting they might have something for her,0.3417658
but nah nah you know when she goes off,0.09288991
she goes off and then Wolverine almost almost have to catch up to her you know because you know it's his movie too so no,0.12087284
she absolutely does a great job as well I really had a tough time thinking anything bad about this movie in any kind of points to dr.,0.11889447
down and really the only thing i have i have two things,0.19372188
i kind of wish,0.0702218
they had they wish,0.056434993
they had expounded upon one and movies Wolverine sick,0.34794638
you know he's not healing i wish,0.15062518
they kind of told you hate this is what's wrong with them,0.24290745
this is like not healing this is returning them but they take the mature they make they take the more mature,0.08156692
well you know you know it gives full out of Schilling and they kind of allude to it and they say hey take that for what it is and run with it,0.072272316
and also what happens to the rest of the accident,0.1581975
you know in the movie it's Caliban Wolverine and Professor X,0.1498785
and there's no other mutants really the speaker and you wonder what will happen to the other mutants weapon to the x-men once again they allude to it,0.18921112
they tell you how you know just this is probably,0.066094324
what happened here,0.06645716
but we're not saying it definite when I'm saying in indefinite terms I again at the moment shear out I understanding your audience is talking about all the time you know like things,0.06929867
you know spoon-fed to you I kind of wished they have spoon fed me this one,0.60466737
but I can live with it,0.051643126
it's the more mature around,0.059964724
it's good storytelling,0.06018361
I get it because this movie is essentially 17 years of the making I have to give it a night out of 10,0.08987084
this is something,0.058599096
we've been waiting for for a long long time,0.053559057
they finally delivered it to us in a near perfect package,0.048686616
it's like when we first seen the spider-man in in civil wars like this is what we've been waiting for,0.15022048
and so that's why spider-man stole that show,0.4477245
we learn that whole movie this Logan is what we've been waiting with you know excellent fan comic book fans have been waiting for for a long time,0.090234414
and they gave it to us and uh nicely wrapped bowl so what do you think of Logan do you think maybe it was too sad,0.055274628
you think those two series for a comic book movie do you believe that this has to do with Deadpool success let me know,0.08414145
