I'm telling you Wars of Commons Knights of the Ku Klux Klan that's us Stallworth,0.24195424
brothers so I'm a big fan of Spike Lee I am I am he's directed,0.0913058
some of my most favorite films of all time but in 2003 sir you tried,0.091287725
to adapt this film right here all boy something that I found in 2013 it's,0.10162002
a Korean film and I did not like your adaptation at all but you came,0.17688529
back in 2015 with chiraq I love that film a lot of people actually tried,0.068359785
to crap on it but I appreciated everything that you were trying to portray in,0.82323027
that movie and your adaptation of your own film she's got a heavy that you,0.31089434
did in the 80s and read the elation on Netflix that was pretty good too,0.087869346
but now we have black Klansmen where you are calling out the KKK is this,0.5154597
gonna be one of your greatest films of all time or is it gonna be,0.29804263
kind of mediocre less find out my name is Brenna keep Avery and this is,0.53299636
just my opinion hey what's going on everyone thank you so much for tuning into,0.10577715
my opinion slash review for black Klansmen I really do appreciate it now like I,0.32191703
said in my intro of this video this feeling bless Klansmen is being written and,0.12438424
directed by Spike Lee I am a big fan of his I love do the,0.055362433
right thing inside man Malcolm X especially I pretty much love all of his films,0.29345626
except for that adaptation of oh boy which I'll talked about and this film is,0.090409115
also being produced by Jordan Peele I'm a fan of Jordan Peele as well he,0.06588117
first popped on the scene for me just kind of being a comedian and that's,0.1523763
how I say he popped on the scene I really wasn't a fan of his,0.16748263
but I really became a fan of his because you know Jordan Peele wrote and,0.06732605
directed get out which came up with like February 2016 and he or excuse me,0.10537291
February 2017 and he won best I think it was Best Adapted Screenplay for that,0.04861967
film and it was very well deserved actually when I first heard about this film,0.10176522
I thought Jordan Peele was gonna be the director but Spike Lee ended up being,0.06782784
the director now this film less clansmen is based on a true story that happened,0.07697353
in the 70s we have a black American by the name of Ron start work,0.16457382
there was part of the Colorado Police Department that was able to successfully infiltrate the,0.060726847
Ku Klux Klan in that chapter and actually become the leader and when I first,0.30532485
heard about this story pretty much just like everybody else I was just like oh,0.0677119
just you know kind of taken aback like is this is this real is this,0.12485078
kind of like some fiction fairy tale or something like that like Django Unchained or,0.12022259
you know like like is this some type of fantasy but no this is like,0.11760757
a real true story now they did Spike Lee did take a few liberties with,0.068991594
this film like in real life it took place in 1979 but in this film,0.13332133
he decided to put it in 1972 and that's just because you know he wanted,0.06801822
to take advantage of like you know and showcasing like all the trendy blaxploitation films,0.19799334
that came out at their time and it was just a number of other reasons,0.1029336
too now what's crazy about this film to me and I'm gonna say crazy in,0.41666478
a good way is the mixing of all sorts of tones I mean this has,0.07239109
a very extremely strong political message of course it deals with racism I mean that's,0.2572491
blatantly obvious and just this with a lot of serious issues but at the same,0.07315129
time this is not a film they just kind of beat you up and beat,0.4490557
you over the head to where you're walking out and you're exhausted like oh my,0.24000981
gosh man like oh I can breathe now that was tough I mean I'm glad,0.17354792
I watched it and it was tough no no it is nothing like that it,0.08565999
is nothing like that movie Detroit which came out last year that Kathryn Bigelow did,0.14936048
that also starred starring John boyega which I really did enjoy the film but I,0.056786202
kind of said to myself like okay this is a great film and I enjoyed,0.050673652
it and you know our like that I got a little sense of history but,0.07490712
I never want to see it again you know unless you some type of homework,0.106108084
assignment because you know this as a black American myself you know you don't really,0.49106938
like seeing your people getting their ass beat and raped and tortured and killed and,0.95911455
all that good stuff so but the good thing about this movie is that it,0.09726168
is not like it is very serious tone at times but at the same time,0.08291065
this film has a ton of levity to it I mean I you know some,0.18142547
people are something I never really do before I give my review before I give,0.3593452
my opinion is we'll watch other people's reviews because unnaturally you know you will sometimes,0.09606389
mimic what they say and put it in your review but for blacks Klansmen you,0.7676813
know I really couldn't help it and there are other people just saying you know,0.07747634
hey you know I don't want to call this movie a comedy you know but,0.18045633
it does have funny mom I said I'm just gonna go ahead and go therefore,0.12689742
and call it a comedy two of me it is a biography it is a,0.12525907
crime story a little mystery in there too but it is a comedy as well,0.1493785
and I just got to give Spike Lee some kudos there's some accolades because I,0.054407995
just really think he just did a great job of balancing the serious things you,0.10106192
know in this movie as well as the comedy and mention it together you know,0.13178746
not in the microwave but in an oven long cooked meal that's just been soaking,0.18173495
for hours and hours and hours he did a great job there now Ross Starr,0.089814775
worth is being played by John David Washington if you did not know already this,0.1043894
is not John this is Denzel Washington's real biological and I reacted to this trailer,0.10541909
a couple of months ago and when I first reacted to the trailer I did,0.05189128
not realize that that was that was Denzel Washington son or whatever I cut it,0.27670372
I was kind of watching it and just kind of thinking to myself you know,0.056881662
you know that's I don't know that was kind of some similarities there but actually,0.06842711
when I turn the video off and was doing my editing process that's when I,0.148919
realized there and John David Washington he did a great job in you know he's,0.03975773
actually been in a number of Spike Lee's films before work or Spike Lee dear,0.08028579
macro mix which came out I believe in 1992 off the top of my head,0.18757647
I want to see the 94 or 92 I feel like I should just note,0.03860943
it off the top of my head but John David Washington was actually the little,0.07643711
boy in the in one of the classrooms and they're seen but now he's a,0.058189876
grown man 34 years old just had a birthday in July 28th and he did,0.035382513
a great job I mean the guy it was just fantastic on screen there was,0.113484144
times to where he sounded you know you can hear his father coming through his,0.11846501
through his voice you know at different points in the film and of course that's,0.05186716
you know only natural I mean you know there's a father-son relationship but when the,0.14263651
acting did get intense in this film you can just hear all Denzel you know,0.09577455
I was just kind of smiling and intrigued at the edge of my cell okay,0.08539449
get pumped up in the mood I feel you my brother you know and you,0.21778785
know it's John Dave Washington but you hear you hear heard nothing on but Denzel,0.07095179
but besides that I'm and I just started to say hey you know if you,0.09432126
are fan of busy Washington and you like his movies I mean that's just another,0.13744539
reason for you to come see this movie - because Denzel is a great actor,0.092105806
and so is his son and I'm definitely going to be paying attention to this,0.04975284
man in the future just some other films that he's been in or other material,0.1919251
I believe he was in ballers when I looked this up Earl and I'm just,0.0821724
yeah he was in ballers he was also in the Book of Eli and I,0.051070407
don't remember him in the Book of Eli or maybe no he was not in,0.056618474
the Book of Eli he was a Malcolm X love bees roms Monsters and Men,0.27592126
months Black Panther and he has something that's coming out there was an arrow it's,0.052142564
completed the old man and the gun and I don't know anything about that I,0.29209608
just learned about it as I'm clicking this shooting this video but I'm definitely going,0.36212048
to be looking him up from now on but he is great in the film,0.06011243
I love this character it you know this is a real life character you know,0.10199164
I saw a side character I love this portrayal of the character he can you,0.07990184
know act his ass off also in the films just something that I liked about,0.88373685
him and I don't know if this is a liberty you know he was just,0.086002655
kind of like a smooth-talking brother just very confident of himself and there's something that,0.09754088
I can respect and you know he looked great on film and somebody does that,0.037612677
he looked great on film with his Adam driver you know they the Adam driver,0.10154493
played somebody by the name of flip let me see the yeah flip Zimmerman a,0.15026613
real Jewish person in real life of course because this is based on a true,0.36773574
story Adam driver is great you know he is kylo Ren and the Star Wars,0.07952261
films he also played and I'm ton of other things I'm a big fan of,0.04928664
Adam driver too the chemistry between these two characters on screen was just perfect there,0.035343517
was one scene and like we said guys when others film this with politics and,0.057669993
racism and hate and bigotry and a bunch of stupidity from the white supremacist and,0.9328839
the white extremists okay so you have a black man and you have a Jewish,0.69542736
man two of the most hated groups on the planet I would say black people,0.7444439
more but there was just a scene in between these two you know a black,0.35886
man in the Jewish man just like you know hey not the kind of comparing,0.48693106
their plight and how they're gonna deal with the white supremacy this scene right here,0.49284267
was just kind of one of my favorites because it was just kind of like,0.031611547
a wake-up call to me and it'll be a wake-up call to everybody that's just,0.11507661
like I mean look man you can't just keep going through life you know being,0.2808837
in la-la land trying to ignore things acting like everything's okay there are people out,0.15444866
there that hate me they're people I thought I hates you and they want to,0.5154597
kill us for no damn reason why don't you act like you have any skin,0.92514867
in the game I mean this was just a very powerful scene in me and,0.07082101
I really like that I really like it besides all the comedy that was going,0.10593748
on the screen because I was just laughing my ass off out loud at a,0.79066616
number of points in this movie some of them that were actually in the trailer,0.0980532
when you see them in the trailer they're not as funny in the movie that's,0.18863015
not the case here I was still laughing so bob was laughing and ron Stallworth,0.19539468
and adam driver i was also just really just kind of rubbing my chin like,0.1180185
man this is a deep-ass scene right here not like this you know give me,0.76921636
more yes yes yes yes yes something else that you know I hear people complaining,0.114395805
about not with this movie just with movies in general is that they don't like,0.06955128
it when a movie is too preachy but this film is preachy but I liked,0.1044193
it in a good way and it felt organic and just another character in this,0.058085065
movie another actor that just kind of like brought that to the forefront and this,0.08893719
did a great great drop excuse me a great job is Corey Hawkins who is,0.17838359
playing a qualm mates hooray who is a Trinity I keep saying a real-life person,0.30368668
everybody in this movie is real so I'm gonna try not to say that anymore,0.13480142
just have someone saying I'm kind of excited he wants array is a here's one,0.14133954
of the people that helped with the civil rights movement you know decades and decades,0.063299604
ago he's a global pan-africanist born in Trinidad you know they had Corey Hawkins playing,0.26634762
him in this movie Corey Hawkins played dr. Dre in the Straight Outta Compton film,0.16919918
directed by Edgar Greta came out in 2015 and he was also play in the,0.055699516
film Kong Skull Island I think that came out March of 2016 with Jason Mitchell,0.09872683
was well who was instructed to Compton did a great job did this seem right,0.08986619
he was another part of singing you know I mean and we've seen movies before,0.102567054
they talked about you know black liberation and freedom and black power and i'm black,0.4755516
y'all and i'm black y'all and i'm black and black and you know we've seen,0.19049263
that before and i'm not saying that i get tired of it but you know,0.1668429
in this particular scene and just really this horror movie they kind of just take,0.17170747
it to another level you know and i'm just gonna go ahead and talk to,0.053396363
my black people right now you mean you know we you know we really just,0.3572255
kind of messed up in the head you know we have self love for ourselves,0.37493274
but at the same time you know there's still a lot of self hatred you,0.4506881
know that we have to deal with you know because was the brother Kanye get,0.14683956
out the single place from birth they made us hate ourselves and loved it well,0.40324643
for me and that is just still a problem that we did with day but,0.06438181
in this fear on man you're just gonna be looking at yourself just gonna be,0.40330932
so proud to be black you know I'm saying and I'm not saying if you,0.604932
wired are you brown on you yellow or whatever they are red that you only,0.35318622
got to be proud of being that too but I'm just saying I mean this,0.07316157
right here is kind of just focused on black people right now and it's just,0.55932236
kind of just so unapologetic you know I'm saying Spike Lee is pulling no punches,0.27366188
he is fearless and getting his message or crossing his movie he don't give a,0.11801694
goddamn about what anybody got to say and you're just gonna be just like when,0.7767162
Corey Hawkins is in this movie doing his thing and I don't want to spoil,0.15495469
it for you you're just gonna be like hooking yourself like oh yes black man,0.5876557
but like woman I love you yeah I mean that's how I was gonna make,0.23493025
you feel and in the way that he did that with the visuals and telling,0.05897264
the story when this is going down I was just really spoke to me you,0.0989686
know I'm saying and I'm just like you know why this brother is talking to,0.10487363
me you know I'm saying he waking me up I know I already thought I,0.10471999
was somewhat won't because like we are all at different levels of consciousness you know,0.06991318
as we were going through life and learning this and learning that and with this,0.06863017
the political climate that we have going on and I want to go ahead and,0.06309972
give a shout out to a field scout with the advice show because he going,0.11125589
around town by man I'm so glad the president Trump is an office right now,0.15440436
and the benefit of it is that the truth is coming out and you know,0.06994495
black people are waking up and doing research and just going back to their roots,0.5246064
and things like that you know so just like all that I had another point,0.07639569
to make but I'm just going a million miles a minute right now I I,0.06383232
kind of forgot what I was gonna say but that's okay cuz I still have,0.1317892
much more to say but like just a way like there was something that he,0.08530062
was just kind of doing like there was like the speech going on like you,0.11532017
know with these floating hair saying I just really like the way that was depicted,0.079610035
in this film and it just you know like really spoke to me so Corey,0.07663744
Hawkins did a great job of course John David Watson did a great job Adam,0.11450235
I loved him as well Lord hairier now she was somebody that she's a black,0.5022968
panther and fear her name and this real-life name is Patrice Dumas she did a,0.17623004
great job too and I did not know at first until after when I was,0.06225651
trying to do a little research after film that she was the least character in,0.09662482
spider-man homecoming which came out last nlgger and at the same no she's a I,0.412688
think she's a black and white beautiful mulatto young lady I think she I think,0.52903694
when I looked it up she's 28 years old I did not know that and,0.117624424
so I was looking at this film right here loved earnest him I really wasn't,0.07887699
paying attention to her like that in spite of me at home come on cuz,0.15411788
she was playing a high school student so I'm like okay you know cute girl,0.12585449
but you know you leave at that you know but she looks like a grown,0.26649082
woman in this you know being super black or whatever now I loved her in,0.32351243
this film is with her portrayal she did a great job I have a lot,0.096566215
of respect for her as an actress and you know she will be on my,0.14674181
radar too as far as casting a son I'm just talking about black people or,0.42200556
the protagonist of this hand but we also got to talk about the KKK because,0.076693095
this filmed is with Ron style worth infiltrating them in there becoming the leader meeting,0.15136403
up with David Duke or whatever let's talk about David Duke who is being played,0.11449762
portray about Topher Grace who was in that horrible spider-man 3 is venom he also,0.5154597
done a 70 show did a great job as David Duke I mean really great,0.14939336
actor this is like perfect casting and there are some other actors that I want,0.080288865
a mission is where by the name of Ryan Agarwal and Jasper I'm not even,0.09860865
gonna try to pronounce his name I just wanna say Pat come on but I,0.17928772
know that's not right he's from Finland I don't even yeah they just did a,0.17860986
great job as well too and I just really liked what Spike Lee was able,0.06767302
to do with this film is that we really just got to see in a,0.05321248
good sense you know the inner workings of the KKK the Ku Klux Klan nothing,0.31089434
to know the filmmaker has ever done that before but it even got as deep,0.062583774
as you know we get to see them you're doing pillow talk in just with,0.13516657
the KKK I mean they go around with regular clothes on you know but -,0.31089434
how the robes and things like that but I mean you just never know you,0.2429164
can be at the grocery store at the gas station and you know you need,0.046487667
to see a white supremacist you may not know that because they have on regular,0.6338574
clothes but you know at night they like to burn processes it's like that when,0.2545029
I what the point I'm trying to make is Spike Lee did a great job,0.0743499
and I'm not necessarily saying I'm happy about this in in a real sense but,0.06794263
it did a great job of just kind of showing how the white supremacist and,0.6246054
the KKK can hide in plain sight and how they're not all the same I,0.14270313
mean you know you will probably want to think that a neo-nazi or take a,0.4354258
care of some stupid knee Angela neanderthal just gonna roll oh well you know drunk,0.8606264
all the time with no teeth to things like that no I mean you have,0.19478899
somebody in this field I mean like I was like is this a real person,0.16952746
I mean every word that came out of mouth whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo and I'm not exaggerating at,0.25052375
all like I'm just like me you are really just pathetic Nelson had a KKK,0.83181864
person ever just crazy I always just ready to fight but then they also had,0.4557419
just somebody that was just kind of clean-cut and just kind of calm and collected,0.2423713
or whatever so they all did great jobs and their performance but I just like,0.026931908
to dynamic there of how you had all these KKK people you know portraying the,0.29766002
roads and it was all they all had the same cause which was nlgger racist,0.62451625
bigot Rachel racist bigoted hatred but they did a great job in the role and,0.70777416
that's just you know something I like this so across the board the casting is,0.0763872
great and I really did love all that this film dresses a lot we have,0.105426766
Alec Baldwin you know how in the very beginning of the film there's kind of,0.06069531
like a little shorten oh I don't want to spoil the feeling for you I,0.16578239
don't want to do that but you know there was an address to the nation,0.077503175
and this this this family's really kind of dives deep and breaks to the ocean,0.15209147
floor through the Mariana Trench just to kind of get down of destructive ridiculous you,0.8247878
know insane mindset that these people have to have to think that you know they're,0.5018722
righteous I mean that they're just just insane and they found nothing wrong with it,0.52323735
I mean you have some crazy people that know they're crazy but you also have,0.76867604
some people that are crazy and they have these views and they they really think,0.55753845
that they are the sane ones or whatever you know that was portrayed great through,0.20594902
Topher Grace's performances David Duke Alec bomb and Alec ball Alec Baldwin is will something,0.15264106
else that I really just loved in this film is the soundtrack okay I talked,0.06602401
about earlier how Adele kind of kind of gave some accolades and Shawn some butter,0.06314787
on all blaxploitation films rah got some old 70 songs too I've got some temptations,0.085817665
in there got this and that I thought I wrote down the person that did,0.12177666
the music and I guess I did not write that down here in my notes,0.09536459
so I do apologize but I have to look this person up real quick because,0.12708418
they did a great great job I saw this film Thursday night and Friday all,0.08222765
day and work at my day job I couldn't I will keep playing the song,0.07633503
over and over and over in my head just I'm not doing a great job,0.19196776
they're trying to you know put all the melodies together but it would it would,0.06453594
it just it's in my hair right now just a great great soundtrack but the,0.07563021
gentleman's name is Terence Blanchard I just had to mention him oh he's a brother,0.12358076
as well yeah I just had to mention him cuz I he just did a,0.060249705
great great job and apparently he's what he's worked with Spike Lee in all his,0.12655048
films as I'm finding out right now he's a composer he's blacks cleanse man shot,0.7093121
wreck Red Tails that wasn't directed bus that was director Bob was a George Lucas,0.16254266
of the George Lucas right that feeling let me see real quick okay Anthony Hemingway,0.053158835
directed that okay maybe I don't know what I'm talking about but let me get,0.1494288
back on point and let me find my cursor real quick but anyway this brother,0.24037324
right here Terence Blanchard you know look him up or whatever YouTube you know he,0.10780496
did he did a great job with the music score you know I love that,0.053526912
of course this film has the n-word in it they say nlgger whole bunch so,0.2646404
if that makes you uncomfortable you know this film probably won't be for you but,0.125514
you know you probably should have known that already of course the SuperDuper Pope back,0.04222648
something that really spoke to me is when they uh there was a mention of,0.05075551
w/e beat the boys and how he talked about double consciousness and how if you,0.1617605
are a native black in this country a black American a descendant of slaves how,0.24114032
you can grow up with a double consciousness you mean you have your black self,0.55660325
but then you have yourself that tries to cater to white society and the and,0.3046749
that accepted that was a scene in that that talked about that double consciousness and,0.06953714
it just really spoke to me and I'm just like man but with this family,0.09016333
my hip man I woke up like 12 times you don't I'm saying like open,0.33596018
over and over again I mean while I was laughing at the same time there,0.06669509
was times where I was they set the edge of my seat just kind of,0.0529942
eating all of that in editing in this film is superb Spike Lee is able,0.18828507
to mix things together and transitions him very well especially with the score I mean,0.14931886
you have one scene ending but you bring in this music and hear all this,0.22089459
dialogue and sound effects and sound editing from something that is not applying to you,0.10110087
visually but then and and you're loving what you're seeing but at the same time,0.073619775
you know you're kind of salivating at the mouth like waiting for the next thing,0.28715783
to come because he's kind of pulling you in and this is something that I,0.18762203
mean I've seen that before but the way he stretches it out you know in,0.096784614
this film particularly is just something out okay you know astrick right there that is,0.13865788
something that I'm going to be talking about when I'm giving my review when I,0.07042951
get my opinion as I'm doing right now what else what else what else something,0.091662295
that is just very difficult I talked about is this mixing serious moments was funny,0.09205083
comedic moments and they did that very well I talked about that yeah across like,0.088562556
you see I've talked about a good number of things I don't want this thing,0.15474817
to be too long but Oh fun facts let's talk about the fun facts in,0.054857545
this me so this film debuted at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival they said this,0.07209398
sparkly got a six minute standing ovation well deserved they're also the real David Duke,0.22700252
actually called Ron star worth not too long ago because he was concerned about his,0.1279704
portrayal in the film and yeah the real David Duke called the real one Stallworth,0.120175265
was about say Oh David Duke also the rostov also said that David Duke tell,0.07018031
him that he has a respect for Spike Lee I was like well I wouldn't,0.11007372
expect I would inspected and contrary to popular belief rust our one start worth actually,0.1522481
used his real voice he didn't fake you know he didn't you may we all,0.116354354
know about coal swishing things like that we black people trying to get a job,0.5154597
and I ha yes I'm Brandon Avery uh-huh my email is yada yada yada yeah,0.14889887
we all know about that or whatever but in this film here and in real,0.05822891
life you know he said he did not use his he did not use his,0.1477366
real I mean he use his real voice he did not try to offer his,0.19214809
white voice and what's also funny isn't there justice in the film no no I,0.15548348
don't want to spoil anything it because it's just great it's just be better for,0.08647109
you if you just go in and not know anything um another interesting thing was,0.3025362
yeah I don't wanna spoil that now I'm not gonna say that because that's just,0.1063734
a good moment toasting him but the real David Duke did not realize that he,0.14362256
was infiltrated until 2006 that's you know I guess he did a great job there,0.05087261
and yeah I talked about how the film actually took place in 1979 but also,0.065166354
took place I mean in real life it took place in 1979 but in the,0.116327636
film they brought it up to 1970 so but guys I was kind of teasing,0.09060615
out the intro of my video talking about is this movie's gonna be good man,0.1824918

one of my most favorite Spike Lee films easily in the top three is up,0.07846127
there with mónica mix and do the right thing I like inside man too but,0.53490317
not as much as this right here and then the ending of this film is,0.08478077
so great we also got to see Spike Lee's signature trademark shot I was waiting,0.09401077
for it too but it came right at the right time I don't know if,0.07482673
it's a if this is the technical name but I saw somebody call it the,0.056094646
person moving shot I kind of called it the glider you know and and and,0.13637787
our two directors especially like sparkly they all have the signature that they can put,0.075222716
on something and you know he did that you know with this shot I like,0.09001414
that I also really like the very ending of this movie it was so real,0.0880327
it was so unapologetic it was so necessary it was so like I said necessary,0.1402936
and in relation to the climate that we have today and people that are in,0.04949127
power and things like that I mean this was a fantastic film um I don't,0.08253752
know if I'm gonna go as far as to say I liked it better than,0.083944745
Malcolm X I may have but at the same time Malcolm X has one of,0.10350735
my most favorite scenes in movie history when they beat up the black dude and,0.6364068
he's in the hospital and Malcolm s get all of his Muslim brothers and sisters,0.5876557
or Muslim brothers in this particular film they all suited and booted and then marched,0.105162084
down to the hospital all in unison and he's like the white cop is like,0.45360824
you know he's all right get him out of Aaron you know Michael he holds,0.12191774
hand like this and points or whatever they alternate me and that's a call that,0.09016148
