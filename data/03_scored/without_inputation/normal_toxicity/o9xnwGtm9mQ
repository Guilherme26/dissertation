what's up guys,0.10309564
it's well back again,0.06963989
and today's review is the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,0.08427723
Thor Ragnarok Dora bagging rock the third installment in the Thor franchise directed by Taika Waititi kicks off when the evil hella invades Asgard hella the goddess of death seeks to rule Asgard and many other lands in an attempt to establish her dominance over the nine realms and bring death to those that defy her Thor after his failed attempt to protect Asgard gets stranded on a strange planet where he's captured by Valkyrie and forced to become a gladiatorial fighter against his friend and fellow Avenger The Incredible Hulk before long though Thor assembles a team and the rest of the film has spent watching the team or crew attempt to escape this strange planet and take back Asgard from the Ebola,0.2557945
alrightso,0.040347837
thor ragnarok had a pretty interesting marketing strategy in contrast to the previous two Thor films that were decently serious overall the third installment was marketed as a more lighthearted silly and fun popcorn flick and honestly that's exactly what this movie is Marvel's marketing efforts,0.32795754
we're not misleading in the slightest and overall I enjoyed thor ragnarok but I think the more the time passes the more hollow,0.119804904
I find the entire experience to be a lot of people are claiming to this film sets a new standard for the MCU,0.06335604
I really could not disagree with that more this isn't one of Marvel's worse films,0.15445048
but I wouldn't say it's one of their best either,0.046627037
I think it's somewhere in the middle of the pack,0.099155426
this is not a film that's ever going to bore you,0.23973082
it moves at a very quick pace and I found myself pretty entertained for the vast majority of it there's some exceptional visuals some really nice comedy very solid performances across the board but I gotta be honest,0.051988702
I'm not overly fond of the goofy at all cost approach that Marvel is currently taking with their films,0.44497517
this is two films in a row now and spider-man homecoming and Thor Ragnarok that I felt missed great opportunities to be something much more than just a silly albeit entertaining superhero film the problem here lies in the fact that Marvel seems fairly intent on making every film with the same tone as guardians of the galaxy,0.3761105
and there's not a tone that aligns naturally with some other heroes in their stories,0.08314809
Marvel was always injected bits of humor into their films to add varying elements of lightheartedness to make the experience more family-friendly,0.110044025
that's totally fine,0.062495492
I think the vast majority of people have always been fine with that now it seems that Marvel is intent on taking the comedic route above all else,0.10098657
and I think that's gonna be something,0.059543252
that's not gonna resonate with a large segment of their fanbase,0.077657044
Thor Ragnarok is a very entertaining movie that I very much enjoyed watching,0.11160844
but I feel like it's the kind of experience that won't resonate with viewers in the way that Marvel films of the past have,0.082006566
I think the primary reason for that is that the film oftentimes refuses to take anything seriously,0.07072315
most people probably won't even realize this when they're watching it,0.08024942
but I think when you leave the theater and start thinking back on your experience,0.11769709
you realize that it could have been so much more,0.062420804
if not for the tone that just seems off,0.09628893
there's several very funny moments,0.06896042
but there's this inescapable feeling of emptiness,0.10675651
I felt when reflecting back on how little character development takes place over the course of this two-hour film I consider that a huge missed opportunity,0.08716316
because these characters have sort of become parodies of themselves and that's kind of sad to me because I've become very attached and very invested in these heroes and their stories that it kind of made me feel like I've been betrayed a little bit by Marvel with how little they're progressing those characters Marvel has always had a formula to their films,0.10753639
but now the formula seems to have shifted heavily in favor of comedy,0.1426302
Thor Ragnarok a lot of times feels like a comedy film with superheroes in it more than does a superhero film with some comedy in it,0.11461289
and that's probably something,0.040137164
that's gonna resonate strongly with the family-friendly crowd but I think will disappoint a lot of the more hardcore Marvel fans that are heavily invested in these characters and their growth because there isn't much growth here for any of the characters really like,0.056740258
I said,0.051518872
it's not like the movie isn't funny it certainly is but there has to be a certain point where the filmmakers sort of rein things in and refocus the audience with the serious issues at hand Ragnarok does really well with its comedy but it doesn't do so hot with its drama and it occasionally doesn't know when enough is enough and to put it serious face on hell,0.3573324
even guardians does that guardians struggles tones pretty effectively Thor Ragnarok doesn't really this is starting to become like a vent session but I just feel like this direction that Marvel was going feels like an over commercialization of their product and attempt to be overly family-friendly above all else even telling a compelling and well-thought-out story some people will love that for me,0.03736193
I don't I miss the attempts at serious character development,0.11680992
but like I said there are definitely some things,0.054282036
Thor Ragnarok does really really well the visuals are outstanding and this is right up there with guardians from Marvel's most vibrant movie yet the costumes the planets and the battle sequences,0.054891996
they all look really colorful and really great visually marvel hit another home run here,0.07811204
it's a beautiful film to look at performance wise,0.060026232
I think everyone's really good Chris Hemsworth is good,0.05453798
and the row is always albeit a little more comedic this time around Tom Hiddleston returns as a new more family-friendly albeit still mischievious,0.12252947
low-key Mark Ruffalo is good as Bruce Banner,0.1405542
aka the hog but don't get your hopes up for development,0.26993123
there's basically none to be found for him,0.083623216
Cate Blanchet is solid as hell,0.44967127
if she's not a great villain but she's certainly serviceable and Tessa Thompson is a nice addition to the team as the strong-willed Bao Cree their performances are all pretty good,0.18146805
I also really enjoy the action there's a lot of style to be found in the battle scenes that lends itself to the strong visual offerings,0.05812612
Marvel has always been good with action,0.15723804
and they continue,0.065288074
that trend,0.08416933
here by delivering some really cool fight scenes,0.19495241
they don't quite rank near the top of the list but are still fun lively colorful and exciting nonetheless but overall,0.060597137
Thor Ragnarok is a fun experience,0.07005182
but I really do believe it's important that you go in expecting comedy and light-hearted superhero fun above all else because that's what this movie is I thought it had solid performances across the board some nice comedy vibrant and lively visual offerings and some strong action sadly also felt the film didn't Joe tones well and felt overly silly,0.3415665
and the character development was lacking pretty heavily regardless i'm gonna give thor ragnarok an 8 out of 10 and generally recommend you check this one out in theaters if you enjoy Marvel movies or you're just looking for some fun,0.11377602
in general make sure fun is your highest priority though because that's what this movie offers first and foremost so did you guys see Thor Ragnarok yet what did you think of it,0.046124835
and if not let me know why not,0.08687735
and also let me know your favorite Thor film honestly I'm taking Thor 1,0.094952196
I think it has the best story and characters that's all for now though this is will Fox if occations signing off see you in the next,0.05788364
