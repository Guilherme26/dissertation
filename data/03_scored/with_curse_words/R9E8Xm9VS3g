puts the car in reverse and he turns around it's just that shot right there,0.19259784
is a shoo-in for like all the Best Supporting Actor Awards this year and if,0.079219654

and Cooper is off the charts I mean these people feel like they're in love,0.105899565
this doesn't feel like acting it feels like one of those films where the cameras,0.111165166

like what what there's other moments where sometimes time has passed but you don't really,0.068048134
realize it and then you realize the time has passed but it didn't really feel,0.04287729
like it past you know the narrative isn't always perfectly flowing there's little character beats,0.080583945
like that that could be a little more fleshed out and some more emotion given,0.06362726
to them but the way you watch an artist taken by the industry and turned,0.08318575
into something that she isn't and a man another artist who's been in the industry,0.31089434
