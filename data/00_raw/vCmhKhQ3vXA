sure max has a grueling gauntlet to run but he should see what creator George Miller had to go through to just get this movie made you're watching beyond the trailers review of Mad Max fury road oh what a day what a lovely day wanna get through this it would seem that the only thing standing between George Miller and cinematic glory is 150 million dollars yes that's the budget for Mad Max fury road and if Miller delivers he'll provide a strong argument that Studios should have more faith in creative talent and let them loose with hundreds of millions of dollars to play with then again while Miller isn't a sure bet he's still a solid bet the creator of the original Mad Max trilogy Miller has since impressed with The Witches of Eastwick babe pig in the city and two Happy Feet movies speaking of Happy Feet for a time Miller toyed with the idea of making Mad Max fury road an animated film along the lines of the legendary Akira an out of left field bid to get the movie made after 25 years in development Mel Gibson had dropped out long ago and was it welcome back after making the wrong kind of headlines Plus for a while all the shooting locations Miller had in mind were considered a security risk but while animated films aimed at adult audiences are quite popular in Asia perhaps Miller felt fury road was risky enough without the added hurdle of trying to convince Western audiences that animation could evolve beyond family entertainment too bad especially because Mad Max fury road might be a tough sell even as a live-action film emulating the work of legendary mainstream photographer Pete Ehrlich whose galleries are a Vegas staple Miller's fourth Mad Max film certainly is pretty to look at but as Neill Blomkamp found out with chappie and his David Ayer might find out what Suicide Squad goth Punk alternative doesn't play too well with American moviegoers in fact pitch perfect - opening the same weekend as expected to beat out Mad Max fury road for the number one spot and further complicating matters is Gibson's replacement tom hardy Hardy signed onto the film just as he was becoming a household name thanks to inception in the Dark Knight Rises but then that star power never materialized but Warner Brothers still has high hopes for Mad Max fury road not only making it a focal point during their last comic-con presentation but citing Hardy for three more movies that's right these days Hollywood finds itself in the movie version of an arm race with each studio trying to lay claim to as many franchises as they can but while Warner Brothers wants Mad Max to compete as a blockbuster meaning a movie that's commercially viable our Mad Max movies commercially viable George Miller just did a major solid for artistic filmmakers everywhere I mean this movie isn't just great it's like AFI top 100 films of all time great it's so grotesque both visually and emotionally that it becomes something beautiful and straight up as this movie demonstrates if the apocalypse ever does come and you're not a white dude run for your [ __ ] life however to be honest the civilized world isn't much better and I think a lot of people trying to make their way in this world regardless of ethnicity or gender will be able to relate to Mad Max fury road I certainly did but then some people will not and I say that because at the end of the film there's a quote that comes up on the screen and at the press screening I attended when that quote came up some people laughed at it dismissing Lee which was unfortunate because it was both unimportant and brilliant waked and the movie and we'll discuss that in my spoiler review but here I will say that it makes me a tiny bit worried about the box-office prospects for Mad Max fury road because it's definitely a blockbuster with a high art sensibility and there's a reason that high art depends on a few buyers with deep pockets rather than mass appeal but then again Apocalypse Now was a very big set of commercially so maybe there is hope for Mad Max fury road and yes I did just compare Mad Max fury road to Apocalypse Now I would say by way of Cirque du Soleil and I mean that I mean that the Cirque du Soleil aspect in a positive way however if you don't appreciate Cirque du Soleil well let's just say that at the press screening I attended there were two types of people in the audience those that applauded the movie and those that laughed at the movie and I'm not just talking at the end of the movie I'm talking during the actual film that's how engaged people work even if it was sometimes in a negative manner people laughter applauded after scenes and action set-pieces also speaking of watching this movie you must must must must must must must see it in 3d seriously if you don't see Mad Max fury road in 3d then you are not seeing it as it was intended to be seen and the 3d is spectacular now I'll go into details in my spoiler review but here I want to just go over some broad strokes first off the world-building in this movie is amazing not just in its attention to detail but its realism how well it's thought-out George Miller has done a fantastic job you know realizing the infrastructure of this you know post-apocalyptic situation that he's created and also its military prowess I mean it's really really impressive and I think some credit goes to his screenwriter who is a UK comic-book writer and I think that you can definitely see that DNA in the film both UK comics which are pretty distinct and also the post-apocalyptic genre and comics which actually the UK tends to specialise in so that's very impressive now as for the actors we're going to discuss here are two leads and we'll discuss everybody else in the spoiler review now Charlize Theron Wow if Tom Hardy wasn't so good-looking this would 100% be her movie she is amazing what a fantastic role not just for a woman but anyone and she nails it watching this movie I was said that she's not Wonder Woman I mean gal gadot really has the bar raised substantially by Mad Max fury road and Charlize Theron performance but maybe she'll be Captain Marvel or somebody if some studio doesn't snap her up after this for some kind of franchise it'll be I think they will but it would be a major missed opportunity this should be the film that makes Charlize Theron finally an action star she's been trying for a while with Aeon Flux and Prometheus but this is her moment this is it she is just spectacular and then Tom Hardy is very good and it's so nice to see his face he often hi he hides it for a good deal of this film actually so when it does come back it really makes an impression and not just because he's good-looking but because it's a powerful acting tool for him I mean he has a very rich a rich and expressive face and he shouldn't hide it all the time and speaking of hiding things you get the feeling that Tom Hardy is almost afraid to let loose with his full acting prowess which is weird I don't understand why he does that and you know you could argue that Mad Max is holding back but I think it's more than that you get the feeling that like Tom Hardy is afraid of his own acting ability and I don't understand it I think it's weird I wish someone would say unleash your inner acting beasts Tom Hardy don't be afraid you know your inner movie star even I mean he's clearly a movie star I would say the he and Ryan Gosling actually have the same problem and they could start some kind of support group for guys who should be at the top of Hollywood but for some reason I keep tripping themselves up and now I want to end my review coming back to George Miller because it's just so wonderful to see a filmmaker who's paid his dues I mean he started out with Mad Max but then he went to Hollywood and he was a part of the Hollywood machine he made his big you know solidly commercial successes you know he put always his own twist on it but you know he had his happy feet as we discussed in the opening he produced the babe and movies he directed this the sequel witches of eastwick he did all that and he was able to pay his dues come full circle just like we're coming back to him in this review and finally take his place as his rightful place obviously based on this film as one of the great filmmakers of all time it's just such a wonder to behold and it's just it's like seeing a butterfly emerge from its cocoon it's just like wow now let's see if he can do it again all right so that's my non-spoiler review of Mad Max fury road my spoiler review will go up later today I hope you'll check that out you know once you've seen the film or if you can't help yourself you might be like me and love spoilers I look forward to continuing this conversation with you down in the comments below and you can check out some other episodes right now [Music]
