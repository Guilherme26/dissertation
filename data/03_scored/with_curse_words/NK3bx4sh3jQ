eighth grade is a new film by Bo Burnham and as hacia absolutely gorgeous movie,0.09801068
that really captures the essence an awkwardness of being a teenager in middle school but,0.08936099
unlike any movie have ever done before most quiet tale of day I don't talk,0.09340725
about at school but if people talk to me and stuff they'd find out that,0.09077143
I'm like really funny and cool and talking by the way I like your shirt,0.15161143
a lot like so cool so there have been a plethora of like high school,0.11301452
movies and all of varying degrees of success and that there really aren't that many,0.036160845
for you know middle school and there are some that maybe have character set in,0.0359491
it but it's not really about life in that time and that's what this is,0.06552685
all about this is like a week in this the last week in this girl's,0.17943244
life of eighth grade well as she's getting ready to graduate grade and getting ready,0.20815665
to move on to high school and this character is portrayed so excellently by isla,0.17711228
Fisher that's just it feels so real that it's incredible I mean you'll know like,0.067436576
I mean if every bit of it it feels so real and it feels so,0.08297898
awkward at times I feel it feels scary at time it feels like if funny,0.15415235
at times if so well crafted by a bo burnham and mainly his first movie,0.13115327
and he's directing and writing it and really he got his vision on the screen,0.1290866
so perfectly and I really again the from a 24 they let him do whatever,0.08229392
he wanted like I've read some some interviews with him talking about the process and,0.10025662
but he's like a you know he he wanted to get your real eighth-graders he,0.36488113
want to have you know 13 year-olds on screen and you know because he wanted,0.13466835
to be real we didn't want some 20 year old playing them and even though,0.12938732
when you have a 13 year old you have to work around the child laws,0.26917857
like he's only filmed for egg nine of the day or something like that I'm,0.23967163
sure you also have to have liked to have had that I think they have,0.086477324
to have like schooling for them to like so I mean they have a lot,0.07144068
of complications with doing this but he it was so much so worth the end,0.108257554
product that you know it's just amazing that he was able to to do this,0.090260684
in the first film finally Fisher plays Kayla and she is again an eighth grader,0.10704029
and she is kind of an introvert but she wants to be you know popular,0.29260412
she wants to hang out with everyone but you know she has a lot of,0.31844217
anxiety but like she does these YouTube videos in their bedroom and they I when,0.16416793
I first saw the trailers I'm a little worried about how they would incorporate the,0.05482709
YouTube videos into the movie but the he does it really masterfully because essentially when,0.13775629
she's going through these events in her life she's going to like her first pool,0.15324792
party or she's meeting up with older kids from the high school that she met,0.15009804
when she was shadowing the one at the mall and there's a lot of different,0.08250986
things that she does and you see like almost like the video kind of playing,0.08688311
like you see in the background there like along with what's going on in present,0.05578539
day and like you see her like almost talking to herself like she the video,0.15765126
was like her giving advice to other people about things but really giving advice to,0.03880042
herself and they she sometimes unable to take her own advice and if it provides,0.113098845
like an inner monologue to because a lot of times stuff to do like and,0.101682924
not be obtrusive and a movie but this is so well crafted that it just,0.070434146
is perfect for it and like you see these moments that like the other kids,0.1423823
like the popular kids I really mean to her and like they're all it's so,0.09039946
well done especially I love because I'm like a lot some she's like it is,0.112153016
a modern take like even at the same time though I mean if you're me,0.10629577
like if you're a guy you still I think relate to her and if you,0.15645398
were like a 7 year old woman I think you'll still relate to her you,0.24228556
know even though you didn't have to deal with the social media and the phones,0.067499496
yes and I think that some of the stuff in this movie could be outdated,0.11815747
after a fear of time but I've seen because like oh it'll live in this,0.11489972
moment and I'll it's like preserving this moment forever and like I love that theme,0.050845094
when she's on the phone or on the laptop like you know in movies most,0.07841444
the time screen images are stimulated because they can do weird things with the lighting,0.11654868
you know from but you know when he was making this he wanted that glow,0.08990617
you get if you ever see if you like if you ever looked at someone,0.15834658
like looking at a phone and darkness like there's this glow that kind of like,0.074029975
envelops their face and this like almost kind of like an eerie sort of glow,0.29779577
but it's it's kind of cool though and like there's no way to get that,0.050403584
without actually having her like have a phone up to her face and you know,0.2908632
when they do that they like she's on Instagram she's on the different sing than,0.07453958
they they made like fake Instagram accounts like I did to make it real to,0.15501958
make it like she's they all these kids are real and you see her like,0.09249592
she has a crush on this hot hot popular guy and like every time they,0.4033874
do that they play this like techno music that if it's really I mean that,0.07510924
it's almost like it's objectifying this kid but I mean that's you know it's all,0.15083407
from her eye her her viewpoint and like the score as a whole is really,0.15444754
grex hland they throughout the movie I loved the score but you know you get,0.058041085
this character like she is trying to deal with things than she's trying to like,0.18516615
and I've also there's a lot of hormones and I think another movie another director,0.116979174
may have like tried to stay away from some of that stuff however in doing,0.09396408
so it would kind of lose the reality of of that of the time like,0.11483779
when you're that old like their hormones are raging even though like you get really,0.3894209
really awkward like you have those hormones and like eoq because you don't know what's,0.44677505
exactly going on and there's some really funny and some cringy moments from this well,0.1570817
probably won my favor most of the whole movie with the girl a banana and,0.34019536
the dad coming in and like because she doesn't she hates bananas but she is,0.39440724
she was going to try to try out something on the banana but it's like,0.2784922
so funny and awkward and I really think Josh Hamilton adds the dad he was,0.15381469
amazing like I I hope that he gets a nominated for you know Supporting Actor,0.117774084
because he is so perfect like I mean so awkward to be the key of,0.321576
the single parents raising a daughter and he doesn't know exactly what's going on but,0.10602792
he wants to be there to help her and like this somebody who's like funny,0.11532715
behalf of horrible moments with them and like I he was always kind of there,0.2601103
for but like also same time like she doesn't want him to be there they,0.11710644
really tackled that relationship so well yeah that that awkward with like she's on the,0.29703417
phone then she just wants to be on the phone and there's a lot of,0.05838265
stuff that is if funny it's a good movie of Washington Cedars because there's so,0.109139554
many different moments that like people will have different reactions to it like it's a,0.06619839
very vocal crowd like cringing or good oh my god like in some scenes and,0.15575509
laughing some laugh like I know live a group a group of girls behind me,0.5120884
laughing really loud like it's some serious some see some sequences and there are like,0.086075574
and there are some things that you know there are some nuts throwing things but,0.2871229
there are some scary sort of moments at one point and in those moments another,0.07113791
movie may go over the top with it or make it like they go too,0.060127117
far but this one it doesn't go far all but then like it's still impactful,0.08307558
to the character you know horrific ly like it's really an interesting take on like,0.18230514
something that can happen like that and that I mean I don't know if ever,0.10763476
seen anything quite like it but if this so like really a horrible moment but,0.18501657
you know you almost don't want to watch like if it's how no it's tough,0.1126841
to describe without like it's boiling icing yeah but it's really just such an amazing,0.102796994
movie there does so many interesting things throughout the whole length and I mean there's,0.031813804
a lot here and it's just like you keep wanting to go with it you,0.18627527
want to see where happen what happens to how what ends up with her character,0.076464154
but then like you also don't want to know like you wanted to let her,0.11783716
have the experience of moments herself so I'm like you want to have her the,0.10996545
camera follow every moment but I really liked everything that this movie did I'm just,0.06995631
so glad that I took a little bit of a road trip to see this,0.084615216
like it wasn't playing in her around me I know like this past week they,0.14377046
upped it to like a hundred theaters but I was actually able to go like,0.05714122
one in State College the theater had there had it like an hour away so,0.061660644
we made the trip and saw that and gotten got some steak afterwards so I,0.041475132
mean it was a great movie to see you well worth the trip so if,0.1439927
you have it look around them Fandango so if you would feel like the nearest,0.35907552
theater that's playing it like it's worth making a trip to go see like we,0.08873851
have essentially support a movie like this and then the film that is so powerful,0.061011292
and so it's so well crafted I I can't wait to see what Burnham does,0.097574905
next this is an amazing film and I would highly recommend it I probably give,0.054660518
it like a nine point seven five out of ten maybe even the ten out,0.10965979
of ten now if I have to see if then one would be like to,0.062376704
watch it again but I don't know if you'll have the same impact like in,0.10242704
repeated viewings but I loved it and if you can go see it you really,0.084456384
shouldn't go see it but thanks for watching and if you got every place on,0.07704186
my head or the scratch me on that see over there and you know if,0.15440641
you liked the video feel free to like and comment and do all that stuff,0.0640036
