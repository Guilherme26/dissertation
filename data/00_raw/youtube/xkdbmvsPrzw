hi guys welcome to a video and this week I just wanted to talk about book-smart because I saw it last minute at the cinema and did not regret it I wasn't sure what to expect really going in I just sort of hype about it on tumblr I'll be honest that's just look lesbian tumblr doesn't get credited enough for how powerful it is in deciding who watches what because the migration starts there I'm telling you I saw a bit about it I decided it appealed to me enough that I was gonna go and watch it in the cinema and yeah let's get into it so book-smart is directed by olivia wilde so it has a female director witches thank you and it's about these teenagers called Amy and Molly who are these overachievers and as graduation looms near they realize that they both sort of missed out on being typical teenagers so cut long story short they resolved to go to this party but they have various comical setbacks before they actually get to the party they need to be up basically I would go as far as to say this is the female version of super bad and it is just as good as super bad and it is just as funny as super bad there were a lot of laugh-out-loud moments I am an elderly bitter lesbian it's quite hard to make me laugh so if I found this film humorous you know its humorous whilst the narrative isn't exactly groundbreaking it brings a fresh look and feel to an old formula basically someone also said that amy was my twin apparently which I'll take because I would offer babies so yeah I'll take that as a compliment the character of Amy is gay the film doesn't revolve around her being gay her being gay is just an aspect of it which is great I don't have any criticisms or any dislikes in this film I just I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and as I say it's not exactly groundbreaking but it's so fresh and funny and well made that it's like who cares basically it's gay it's good it's great it's the best film I've seen this year I am gonna go see Godzilla just because Sally Hawkins is in it and we all know how I feel about Sally Hawkins I don't feel like Godzilla is gonna be as good as book-smart but just Sally Hawkins that's that's anyway completely two very different things okay guys thanks for watching don't forget subscribe for instant ice appointment add I'll see you guys soon bye
