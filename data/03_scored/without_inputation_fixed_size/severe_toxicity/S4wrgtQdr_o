hello everyone today i will be reviewing a night at the opera so a night,0.117293164
at the opera came out in 1935 and was directed by sam wood and this,0.03157627
film is a comedy and stars the marx brothers this was actually the first marx,0.047393005
brothers film to not star zeppo so this film has the three main marx brothers,0.04440234
in it who are groucho chico and harpo and this film is actually about these,0.11551579
two opera stars rosa and rodolfo and they go aboard this ocean liner on the,0.027069649
way to the united states of america and in fact most this film is actually,0.021210711
set on board this ocean liner we also have this other opera star who's known,0.021735542
as ricardo and he is in love with rosa but obviously when all this is,0.051948182
happening we also have the marx brothers in the situation as well so groucho marx,0.09563412
he plays this rich man who is um in love with this lady who's played,0.10138463
by margaret dumont and margo dumont actually appears in quite a lot of the marx,0.09323946
brothers films we also get chico marx who plays ricardo's manager and then we get,0.034509726
harpo marks he plays rodolfo's dresser and since rodolfo is not a very nice guy,0.061568066
poor harpo gets treated quite badly in this film so this was the first time,0.07508925
i'd ever seen this film and it's actually only the second marx brothers film i've,0.040254254
seen the other marx brothers film i've seen is duck soup and when i'm comparing,0.053581875
this to duck soup in all honesty this isn't quite as good as duck soup,0.06580329
though it is a very funny film duck suit is very wacky and crazy and,0.19769524
the plot in that film is a bit ridiculous to be honest whereas the plot,0.24741578
in this film is actually fairly realistic and you can really see this happening as,0.014311426
a proper story even if the markzwares weren't in it but nevertheless the marx brothers,0.026135065
do bring a lot of humor to this film and it's a very enjoyable watch,0.06321174
and there are loads of brilliant jokes scattered throughout this film particularly with groucho marx,0.09537137
he has lots of witty one-liners as he does in all his films he really,0.12778378
is the vocal comedy aspect of the film in terms of actually tenon jokes obviously,0.011980623
harpo marx is a mute so a lot of his comedy is very physical with,0.25167698
the way he is acting and chico marx is always there in the background or,0.026650583
at the front um having a laugh and making a few jokes and being an,0.055687178
excellent presence on screen so all together there are actually lots of funny bits throughout,0.05467344
this film i think possibly my favorite scene in the film is when they're aboard,0.045636255
the ocean liner and poor old groucho marx he is stuck in this tiny room,0.2374212
and the room just has a bed and and a giant suitcase and that's about,0.099601276
it and a tiny sink in the corner and all of a sudden it turns,0.14768939
out that chico and harpo and also um ricardo they have smuggled into a suitcase,0.05963571
and then they all appear in the room so there's these four guys in this,0.031205095
tiny little room all of a sudden someone knocks the door an engineer comes in,0.07298129
then and then afterwards a manicure comes in and then some waiters come in to,0.054938182
deliver the food and all of a sudden this room is really crowded everyone is,0.03895116
jumping on top of each other climbing everywhere it's a really funny scene and then,0.10775909
margaret dumont's character knocks on the door i open it and everybody spills out onto,0.10535112
the floor and obviously it's it's a very physical joke so it's very funny as,0.05997961
you watch it on screen and it's certainly one of the highlights of the film,0.035546083
another brilliant scene is when this man is searching for chico and harpo because they're,0.073550686
basically stowed away illegally and they're hiding and he's looking around these rooms everywhere trying,0.10634557
to find him and all of a sudden these characters they are having to move,0.046623386
the beds out of the way and go outside on the balcony and come back,0.03640417
in again and just the way this whole sequence is arranged is really clever and,0.014678608
it must have been really well thought out you can certainly tell when you're watching,0.016330259
a marx brothers films that a lot of the jokes are actually very intelligent and,0.08085108
are all just put in the exact right place and they'll end up working together,0.04191655
so well in in the context of the story so like i said earlier the,0.020976566
the story in this is actually fairly realistic and it's quite clever the way they,0.013098796
manage to work these jokes in and also create a very believable story with some,0.020293422
excellent humor in it now as i did say i do prefer duck soup and,0.06258047
i think the jokes in duck soup tend to just stand out a bit more,0.13472763
in my mind there are so many funny jokes in duck soup in this film,0.10258662
there are lots of funny jokes there's just not quite as many big jokes or,0.037623454
not um not quite as many memorable sequences as there are in duck suit from,0.05681267
what i can remember watched it last night i enjoyed it quite a bit however,0.08439052
it just didn't have that extra push that duck soup has and although if i'm,0.086988725
being honest although zeppo was in duck soup he didn't have a massive part in,0.057345483
that film anyway so perhaps this film wasn't necessarily missing zeppo and it certainly had,0.029534154
lots of jokes in it and this film also tries to do the um romantic,0.01682449
subplot as well like a lot of the marx brothers films do but this film,0.11110363
actually manages to work their romantic subplot um into the story very well and in,0.036398184
fact there are actually quite a few scenes in this film that don't have the,0.034463163
marx brothers in at all they just have rosa and ricardo and they're actually singing,0.06919174
to each other while one is on the boat and one is down below and,0.046842232
these scenes are obviously opera which obviously comes from the title night at the opera,0.0842648
in general the marx brothers films do have musical elements to them there's this excellent,0.036657605
sequence on the ship when ricardo is singing this song um kosikosa and it's a,0.031033479
very catchy song when everybody is singing along to it so overall i have to,0.039285082
say a night of the opera a really good comedy um one of the best,0.049768373
classic comedies of all time really not as good as duck soup in my opinion,0.1007833
however still very amusing and still a very good comedy i always am surprised by,0.040738508
how well the jokes and marx brothers film hold up nowadays bear in mind this,0.02776676
film is 85 years old so obviously some of it will seem dated obviously but,0.027772082
actually a lot of the jokes they still made me laugh and i had a,0.026687168
very good time having said that it's probably not necessarily one of the films i,0.03066297
would come back to straight away as a classic comedy for some reason doesn't quite,0.13244937
stand out in my mind as much as ones like duck soup nevertheless i do,0.15145832
recommend it and it's an excellent comedy so i'm going to give a night of,0.12777513
the opera a rating of 8 out of 10. it's a fantastic comedy and well,0.061858755
worth seeing so if you enjoy these old classic comedies this is definitely one that,0.04917237
has to be watched so there we go so that is my review of a,0.023395173
night at the opera so what do you guys think have you seen the night,0.031780478
