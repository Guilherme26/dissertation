hey there this a match once again what about to another review this time of,0.07029208
a quiet place which got a lot of good reviews huge box office seems like,0.063626096
everyone loves the film and to be straight up I didn't mind the film but,0.071350016
that was okay that was alright I don't think I'd never see the film again,0.09196813
but I thought I had good acting it was a short film I mean you,0.15364769
take out the end credits it's like an hour and 24 minutes without the inbred,0.1817592
so it's not that one of a flake the premise is intriguing what if you,0.13136515
lived in a world would ya be quiet because these creatures hunt by sound intriguing,0.31089434
premise I like the idea that most of it is done with sign language made,0.04518486
for a different kind of movie prepare two movies of late so it separated stuff,0.08341003
a little bit by doing that I liked Emily Blunt as an actress I thought,0.10409765
she was really good at you tomorrow she does another nice job in this as,0.11244066
the lead John Krasinski he did fine as the husband / father he was also,0.13304746
the director of the film there are some good-looking shots showing the the farmhouse they,0.083682664
live at and I can't really say it's balli directed it is some good-looking shots,0.24140306
it wasn't tons of shaky-cam or too much piss-poor editing or anything of that ilk,0.44391134
so I did credit to the direction in the cast the ideas I mean compared,0.057428908
with horror films and leads I would easily put this above the new it movie,0.10766436
which are nlgger hated with that shitty new penny wise who did his nlgger Futterwacken,0.9100856
dance where the hell was I diesel II put this above something like nlgger sinister,0.5611887
there was a sinister sack of nlgger an easily put this above don't breathe which,0.5876557
if it had likeable characters and didn't have BS like the turkey baster full of,0.2782814
nlgger where you stick up a couch if you didn't have crap like that maybe,0.8606264
I will like don't breathe more when I was really mixed on but if I,0.1379184
had to choose I say I would dislike it more than like it but I,0.11059195
would put a quiet place above that then have funny turkey basters won't come and,0.49821386
villain that was pretty much daredevil but there have been films in the past that,0.15188786
dealt with hunting by sound you had tremors love tremors when my favorite films ever,0.18455933
and that was vibrations from the ground so to really don't make noise or you'll,0.12525943
die love tremors to death you had the descent when they went to the cave,0.70225275
these monsters didn't really hunt by sight he lived in a cave they hunted by,0.56003433
sound and I would easily put tremors into the scent above this now the simple,0.13823922
descent part to didn't go nlgger itself nlgger scene where literally a monster shits on,0.8785311
its main characters so I know that's faint praise a quiet place is better than,0.071546726
the descent part - it's one of those things where I didn't the cast and,0.07639945
they were good but something about this movie just seemed so uneventful to me I,0.10299397
don't know what it is like some parts of the phone remind me a lot,0.11924054
of signs by M night Shyamalan and I was there brother watch signs despite the,0.12685993
bolt the stupidity of the water but why the nlgger where they come to a,0.85195225
place if water was acid to them although here there's a thing one Mike really,0.10338338
okay I'll get to that but I don't know just for some reason it just,0.078308456
didn't feel that it's hard for me to get stared at movie or anything I'm,0.10759915
not saying that's the pump myself up it's just one of those things and I,0.12701093
just found a sort of uneventful I don't know why it monsters on a farmhouse,0.17056306
I mean I could watch nlgger critters for that order will watch plenty of other,0.53490317
movies for that the monster designed and doing it for me they almost seem like,0.35408127
the liquors from resident evil which they hunted by sound to Ashley because they have,0.13776922
eyes so there was only shitty liquors from Resident Evil games so the monsters did,0.823485
impress me the the end beam was kind of it wasn't downbeat it was just,0.08828821
like wait that's how you don't end it like you're waiting for like 10 15,0.24007334
more minutes apt and and then it ends you're like what though that was lame,0.6339871
I did it's an okay alright movie I do feel some overrated film to CERN,0.10692025
how much prep praise and it's one of these things I'm getting nlgger tired of,0.2849401
this this bullsh and what every nlgger horror film comes out this is tears movie,0.7058474
ever and I fainted and I had a heart attack oh my god stairs every,0.38482085
nlgger in two months they did they went for the witch the babadook for the,0.3479107
witch nlgger that movie you Baba dude I didn't see to be fair but they,0.50928503
different city is they did that for sinister which I'm like nlgger this police I,0.4069065
did they were stinking in every horror file that comes out now but yet I,0.5620582
if I go on Netflix I saw this one called the ritual last not too,0.07314797
long ago it came out last year on Netflix I liked the ritual a lot,0.1030417
I would easily put that above something like this I liked the story more I,0.05905527
like the the ending more I liked five I came out on Netflix like the,0.11140745
ritual put above this mmm but that's a film no one knows about zero you,0.13687126
know conversation well I I saw him when we recently called exists which I reviewed,0.091186054
it's a final footage bid for a movie sure but I like that feel much,0.08445015
more than this and FM that nlgger on my critics and no one saw us,0.42431676
about that film but that one I felt more events and felt more I would,0.047837626
just felt more like this one that and some of the nlgger that happened bud,0.36714727
me analyst let me die money on spoilers just discern how much money made it,0.34444034
seems like everyone saw the film and all is not a rant believe me if,0.08566444
I wanted to rant on it I'll rant on something Steve means it which everyone,0.151205
praised from last year I nlgger rant on and cuz I thought it was a,0.24669103
nlgger show a nlgger sandwich I didn't want to eat but this one there in,0.40316677
this empty town and it's three kids Emily Blunt and her husband John Krasinski granted,0.12563533
I don't know why the nlgger they're bringing their kids around in the town why,0.33925647
not just leaving the nlgger home with the husband and the wife go out or,0.22109668
leave him with the wife and the husband go out I don't know why the,0.1488628
nlgger you would take your kids the Walgreens or where the nlgger you got one,0.71921533
just just knows it'll be trouble it seemed like they went out there for some,0.07553398
supplies and medicine and again I'm thinking why the nlgger are you taking everybody out,0.5154597
you have this home and they even have this like basement where well I guess,0.11014327
technically ones like day 89 yells like a 400 something so maybe they didn't have,0.075847425
the house yet I don't know maybe that's why they didn't have the house yet,0.08158223
I would assume they did is there taking all this other electronic I don't know,0.10257404
maybe they didn't Alamo they didn't really give me much detail as to whether they,0.081335075
had a house or not it just seemed like we're like you're leaving your kid,0.18512246
doing all this nlgger keep more of an eye on your nlgger kid yeah or,0.7683046
if you have a house nlgger stay there so what happens the kids playing with,0.19959284
this nlgger toy he just killed and the tiles come up because the parents nlgger,0.8355208
up it's Dave for enduring something they talked with sign language so no dialogue not,0.07482797
much dialogue in the film entirely that was an interesting idea I like that it,0.02947569
made it unique compared to again like I said compared to films recently that was,0.05247926
cool they have their dinner they play Monopoly the kid accidentally knocks his lantern over,0.15475403
and there's wandering and things coming for some reason this couple decide decided to have,0.07474047
another kid I guess oh my so wait a minute what this way that nlgger,0.52883255
is going in the world you decide to get pregnant again I'm like all right,0.22391437
does it make me ask twice about this world when you nlgger do you have,0.5041448
silent nlgger or do you put like a daddy in each other's mouths now maybe,0.51943654
people nlgger with no noise but or maybe they fought in the basement with the,0.38565764
soundproofing I don't know what does it make people why don't everyone just go and,0.15070868
the soundproof all the time like when you have dinner while you have dinner in,0.096195616
the soundproofing basement so you can get more leeway for dishes like why you want,0.15157355
to do everything the soundproof basement I'm just asking a question if this soundproof basement,0.055946473
you worry about noise just do everything there play your games there you know brought,0.05523822
in technically live in the basement of a soundproof but but then do you have,0.06857497
sign on 14 do you nlgger with no noise it'd be hard to do and,0.4534487
how you don't know you know they do kind of quiet a babe I mean,0.27996618
how the hell they don't quite a baby and then later on there is a,0.59189135
baby oh you put a nlgger mask on it and you put on the nlgger,0.7093121
box I'm like well nlgger man you should have had the baby in the first,0.6128218
place then if you don't give it a little nlgger mask and put it in,0.3165559
a nlgger box as if you put away your nlgger video games or something this,0.3868294
little box but I might well this kid's gonna cry a lot so in a,0.2870969
world that you don't want noise I don't think being pregnant should be you know,0.19268952
something you should do especially within like the first year of the nlgger going on,0.21169253
do you think it was like Davey nine so that's almost like three months and,0.08515212
that's a year later given you know maybe five years and then maybe try to,0.057933025
have a kid just saying no just some stuff I'm like so the dad tastes,0.11090834
the kid to fishing and he says something like well we can made noise here,0.07387338
and he does a whoo-whoo because this waterfall I'm like this waterfall okay why don't,0.13814683
you just live by the nlgger waterfall then when you just live by the waterfall,0.470625
live in a nlgger K by the waterfall or something but so they have this,0.21527234
apparently with the waterfall they they can't be heard because I guess the waterfall I,0.07406383
and the river is well not just a waffle but the river stops there they're,0.042084575
noise mainly the waterfall so this weird random what the nlgger scene honestly should have,0.42197537
been in the movie my opinion the dad Center coming back from fishing and the,0.044638734
waterfall scene and this random old guys there with this with and his wife is,0.24239868
dead the dad grows this literally the old god mace like lady ate some bad,0.5364658
like bad food oh he smelled like a ranked fart he's even like he's an,0.7682262
old man he's trying to find his teeth do I have teeth flat like he,0.5193871
made like a weird face that made me laugh like and then just how blue,0.25047788
this guy told me to shut up about he wasn't saying anything until the guy,0.46829554
went and then it's like and then of course they run and the creature kills,0.44222
the old guy the nlgger was this scene about I didn't he was staring out,0.31052172
that was pretty funny like what the nlgger I was right and um Emily Blunt,0.34254083
she's by herself she's ready to give birth prematurely she tries to get down quit,0.32217315
she steps on the nail something falls she has to hide creature stalking her Emily,0.40749025
Blunt does a good job acting wise cinematography is nicely done she turns his faint,0.25339898
on red light to warn people the girl who play the daughter she felt bad,0.3296719
for what happened to her brother long ago and she's like at this little grave,0.4033305
thing sort of a spot to memorialize him and like bits that they do without,0.1513597
dialogue I still didn't they still gave the emotion of the characters - idea of,0.0370409
that's one of the things I could say that made me like the film ok,0.08032474
overall was the cat was the group of actors the use of sign language being,0.07033266
that sort of dealing with silence and having not much dialogue in it in the,0.15399179
entire movie at all I mean if there's ten lines of dialogue in the film,0.07464826
that'd be a surprise and I didn't that's one of the things that's intriguing about,0.05349762
it but then kids run around the cornfields I don't know that just made me,0.071324736
think of the film signs which I did I'd rather be watching signs she did,0.05288606
birth in this bathtub the father comes in they're alive the baby's alive they put,0.5274369
this little mass and they put the baby in a box turn the baby again,0.35641724
the basement is being flooded these kids are in the silo the dad tries it,0.1553613
on for the two kids he gets wounded he made some noise for self-sacrifice and,0.284186
I'm thinking I know you're wounded but why are you at least try running or,0.17113084
just throw something don't run just you have a you dropped an axe why don't,0.15343331
you throw the axe that'll make some sound enough for the kids I get out,0.19594572
of there I mean it's gonna kill you in 30 seconds if you throw the,0.8355208
actors don't get there in 30 seconds so the self-sacrifice only was needed I get,0.24018814
for the emotional idea cuz the father the daughter when I seen eye to eye,0.09743448
and he sign languages I love you so I and emotionally I the emotional idea,0.08315055
of the story I did but it was like you just dropped a thing you,0.17263041
try thrown for the creature that go over there when these kids were in the,0.2554502
silo they were trapped and the creatures attacking them and when you see throughout this,0.31089434
is that the the little girl the girl has his hearing aid thing as high,0.24133392
frequency nlgger with the creature so after the dad's killed by so sacrifice that a,0.43566656
mic I think you've heard down something else in those the two T's did to,0.14888428
the mom they get to this place where the dad would try to radio or,0.15337333
at least see if there was any frequencies working the creature comes in again I'm,0.08729253
not a fan the creature design it was just very mediocre I'm not an original,0.38490218
again it looked like a nlgger shitty liquor from the resin Resident Evil games again,0.93232936
they do hunt by sound - just a generic look that's the worm what is,0.4101867
a generic looked on the creature I'm where I'm waiting for Jill Valentine to come,0.104096726
out and shoot the nlgger or Chris Redfield really I should say Chris Redfield or,0.53490317
no well yeah res evil five he fought them oh sure said Leon Kennedy and,0.17344312
Claire Redfield was the first time my son wasn't evil to see IRA I'm talking,0.084754884
more about that yeah she said Leon Kennedy but she nlgger with the frequency and,0.27507225
that messes up with the creature I guess it makes part of its head exposed,0.30323616
so that when Emily Blunt shoots it with a shotgun a blows the head up,0.47257742
CG I was in kind of wish they'd gone for a more practical route cuz,0.14891538
I know they had a somewhat lower budget so the CGI wasn't on the creature,0.14025119
and then I know my friend Michael Keene mentioned this like how the nlgger is,0.24047202
it that none of the scientists in this world knew this frequency thing would work,0.11367183
yet this little girl figures it out fairly quickly and within one night and I'm,0.36040807
like that would have been one of the first things that scientists would have done,0.067358896
like they hunt by sound oh nlgger frequencies of course should have had us and,0.44401124
then we've seen a lot of movies why movies I deal with sound whether it,0.0527358
be alien invasion movie suddenly usually does were frequencies hell even Mars Attacks did that,0.32121423
where they that yodeling music made their heads blow up so alright just seemed like,0.5154597
a pretty quick easy answer to the problem and then the ending is that really,0.07496169
an ending it's almost as if there should be a to be continued because multiple,0.1265301
creatures come in there are coming the little girl gets the frequency you know equipment,0.38222578
loaded up Emily Blunt costs the shotgun and then the movie ends and I like,0.15594988
so what now like what that's it so I know it seems like I've been,0.08277804
ranting a lot but I'm just throwing out my nitpicks in there you cold nitpicks,0.42569804
yeah but I'm just the one on my nip it's in there and I think,0.31089434
this Athene is that yeah every film is without sin every film has their nitpicks,0.1262808
it's just uh there's not gonna be rant people don't say well you just don't,0.15092601
want to ranches you don't want to get in trouble please me I've got in,0.24017735
trouble a lot many times in the past and many times in the future I,0.095424294
will this it wasn't like a terrible time watching it wasn't like a board to,0.11442801
sit through it wasn't oh my god I hate these characters the characters were fine,0.385651
the acting was good the idea was intriguing the directionless handled competently the lack of,0.096861094
dialogue made it more interesting than the norm and overall it was a enough movie,0.037619647
that didn't feel like it was a huge waste of time eighty some Menace boom,0.14378993
you're out you know it's worth a watch absolutely I just don't see why would,0.18649767
ever we watch the film and I would the idea not to put I would,0.10381364
put tremors above it I put the dissent above it overall it's an OK but,0.10079516
I feel overrated film I didn't think it was that Styria didn't think it was,0.0574766
that suspenseful I didn't think it was terrifying I thought the creatures were generic designs,0.089167304
I know our pian this the third time but they seem I'm lickers to me,0.26022574
parts of the storyline huh and the ending was just sort of a almost a,0.061308723
nlgger ending anyway okay movie saw wands probably never see it again that's a quiet,0.24253875
place so either way thanks for watching take care and we'll see you later bye,0.06782274
