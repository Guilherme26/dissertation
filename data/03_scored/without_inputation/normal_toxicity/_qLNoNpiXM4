as someone who said his fair share of Moving's mentality difficulties and ethnic clashes in the family,0.18490937
I very strongly believe that the complexity of multicultural families is a very difficult thing to tackle in any audio-visual form let alone a one and a half hour feature of course,0.07369768
I can't possibly speak for any expat family but mine and I most definitely cannot compare my frankly very privileged position to the experience of chinese-american families yet somehow Loula Wong's The Farewell manages to capture that unique charm of being stuck inside your own strangely cosmopolitan identity although while unfolding a universally congenial story that is both profoundly sad and endearingly hilarious the film is a true account of Wong's experiences with her family and follows her or Billie as she's called in the script after she receives the news that her grandmother 9'i has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and has only three months left to live,0.10905445
ironically that isn't even the most tragic fact due to Chinese tradition cancer patients don't always receive the news from hospitals or their families,0.18426721
and are left in the dark up until their very death,0.6615251
so using her cousin's fake wedding as a ploy to visit the grandmother Billie and her parents traveled to China to bid,0.24067944
nine a farewell,0.06723412
let me just say this right off the bat,0.2418332
the farewell is a remarkable work for a multitude of reasons,0.08908707
but one that has to be mentioned,0.066545196
at the forefront of this review is that Lula Wang managed to direct this entirely personal incredibly heartfelt film well the fully chinese-american cast and around 80% of the dialogue being in Mandarin for a crowd-pleasing PG rated film like this,0.086312845
and hopefully 8:24 give it a decently sized domestic release,0.09385679
this truly is a breakthrough,0.14992884
in indie cinema of course,0.07680195
we had crazy rich Asians last year but that film had the backing of Warner Brothers and a somewhat established book fan base,0.41386575
so the quality of that comparison is zero to none if you're watching this video when the farewell is already out in your country,0.15212414
please show your support,0.059116732
it's an extraordinary film okay and now that I'm done with publicity let's talk about why the farewells bleak subject matter is soba Musa Lee delightful in the context of our grim everyday reality at the heart of it,0.15506153
we have a timeless elegy that's rats in this darkly comedic package of cultural traditions identity confusion and moving authenticity the farewell walks on that thin line between comedy and tragedy,0.23087724
there is a scene here is during which a congratulatory speech,0.07576057
turns it to what essentially is a eulogy a person breaks down,0.10607432
crying the camera slowly pans out to reveal the confused audience and the only thing left for us,0.1583422
the viewers is to laugh while trying to suppress that overwhelming sense of sorrow,0.15754952
the genuineness of the constructed narrative,0.055567533
and the way she presents it is what truly makes Lulu Wong suffer more efforts stand out she mentioned during the Q&A that she was slightly inspired by the works of Roy Anderson and Ruben Auslan but honestly I would argue that in the melancholic satirical works of those directors there is always a conspicuous sense of detachment which is a stark contrast with Wong's direct openness with a viewer she's ready to be vulnerable in front of the audience while sharing a chapter in her book of life,0.10140176
and I think that's a rare occurrence in modern non documentary cinema in a way it kind of reminded me of the light sanyas Varda and her approach to storytelling so effortlessly assured yet delicate and wise and the fellows about tight-knit relatives and family values,0.051191922
it's always crucial for the entire production to be as invested in the script as your writers and your directors because otherwise the work would just lose his distinctive sense of identity and that is usually what the films of that kind of subject matter go for,0.08874191
thankfully that is not the case for the farewell because the end sum will cast and the crew pulled off something miraculous here,0.056836475
and I mean truly truly remarkable you not only believe this seemingly preposterous for the Western society story but you also feel through every emotion that the character Billy played by Aquafina ghost - it's a vividly spiritual experience that not only says a lot about one's relationship with their family but also with themselves and it is truly enhanced by awkwafina's remarkably tender,0.09678634
performance she goes through so many emotional states throughout the film it's very impressive to see what she did,0.06530985
here it was surprising to see her tackle such an emotionally,0.42914543
challenging but she proves to be much more than just the quirky character that Hollywood try to pitch her ass,0.91035473
admittedly,0.050913516
she does have great comedic timing but she also has a very impressive dramatic range that I hope to see more of in the coming years Lulu long mentioned that the casting process was a very important aspect of her film and that she fought many many years with many producers who did not want to fund a fully Asian cast feature clearly after seeing the film I cannot possibly imagine a different outcome,0.024978373
I think that when I was watching the film it almost felt like every single character,0.033586174
and the actor blended in together it feels like they lived through their respective roles,0.07997063
and I think one of them actually did the nice sister in the film was played by Wong's great on so it is the family feature really in every sense of the word ones attention to detail is also evidence in the film's visual and musical choices grays and blues dominate the film's color palette reflecting the characters emotional states occasionally breaking into the hopeful orange and greens during the dream sequences that roaring borderline amusing sadness is further intensified by Alex Weston's outstanding score that only amplifies the mournful ambience of a wedding bouquet and the perplexing laughter that follows,0.005208433
it's a scrupulously detailed film that makes me wonder how come this is just one second feature a less skilled director would have definitely gone for more flatulent pathos or emotional manipulation or maybe even visual exuberance yet what Wang achieves here is,0.22634037
so muted yet so effective and the emotional qualities of the film reach their Apogee only at the very very end of the film with a beautiful final shot,0.32448792
now I know that I can be entirely objective,0.0516358
in the case of this film the portrayal of a character struggling with cultural identity and belonging is something that hits very close to home,0.055929895
I come from a multicultural family my family members are scattered all across the world and right,0.22167793
now I live in the UK a country where I have no relatives whatsoever,0.24072865
so the question where is my home arises practically on a daily basis yet underneath all of that there is a very very special film,0.08396616
and the one that will resonate with anyone,0.058161616
it's a love letter to every single person in our lives who keeps us going who keeps us pushing through and ultimately isn't that the most important connection,0.121353604
