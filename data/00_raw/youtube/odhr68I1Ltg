what a lovely movie what a lovely movie it was pretty good so I just saw Mad Max fury road and whoa holy hell I'm still processing everything this film had so much time surrounding it even when Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 98% then I'm glad I'm reviewing this film the following day because at first I wasn't sure how to feel about it I watched the first two Mad Max films I never got around to the third one but watching this modern-day take on it was so kinetic so fast paced it was so different that I wasn't entirely sure how to respond but after thinking about it yeah this film it's pretty [ __ ] sweet what everyone's saying about this film is that it's an amazing action film some are saying that it's one of the best of years some are saying it's one of the best of all time some are even saying it is the best of all time some are even saying God doesn't exist but this movie exists essentially this film was I got 90 minutes a two-hour car chase but it's done like Mad Max style meaning you get the awesome production design to get the incredibly assembled vehicles you get insane Road thrashing so serious like brutal deaths sometimes watching death in a movie is so cool it's never cool in real life but sometimes you know like watching people get killed you're sick you're you're all sick but the movie was greedy it was haunting it was violent yeah it's like not grotesque that's actually something I greatly admire about this film it like feels more disturbing and violent than it actually is showing you there's really not much core in this film when there is gore it's like so fast-paced that you don't even remember what it looked like I loved it because this whole plot this whole story takes place in the middle of this adventure like the trailers don't give away the plot for you so I don't want to ruin it for you either like a short synopsis for me Charley's Theron is on the road to somewhere where people are trying to stop her and she gets the help of Mad Max and hence the chase ensues it's interesting because this movie is mainly but it does take time for character in like little moments you learned about the characters like throughout the adventure through how they're responding to this adventure without having like expositional dialogue you see when I first walked out of this film I was like that dude did it have much character but that's I thought about it more I realized that it just didn't have like expositional dialogue George Miller not Frank Miller you say Frank Miller a lot of people are gonna kill you trust me but George Miller has this like wonderful ability to like come up with a story and it's like post-apocalyptic world driven by the power of fuel and water resources rather than making his films like a big exploration of this world he always focuses on the plot and he only allows his characters to say what they would say in that moment of time so it actually wouldn't make sense for these like strangers coming together during this really high intense chase sequence to start giving a bunch of expositional dialogue but if you pay attention to story and the characters all they're like this film has a pretty strong theme about redemption they're about three main characters in this and it's really targeted towards redemption and it's interesting because you actually understand more of the characters and how they respond to the violence how they go about the violent moments and in between George Miller really allows his actors to provide that depth without having to tell the audience exactly everything about someone's past or what they're currently thinking Tom Hardy as Mad Max Mel Gibson played the original max and that was a legendary character and I'm so glad that Tom Hardy wasn't trying to be Mel Gibson's max Tom Hardy's backs actually seems like you might be older he seems very haunted by the wasteland on to by his mistakes from the past he's like actually going a little insane at times she sort of reminds me from that weird creepy boy from the road warrior because Tom Hardy's Max is sort of like an aggressive boy like he doesn't speak much she doesn't there's a lot of grunting a lot of that like you could tell he's a really violent threat but you can still so see that he has a heart but similar to how I sort of perceived a road warrior Max is sort of used more as a character device to support the bigger picture of other characters like Charlize Theron character the trailers didn't reveal who she really was so I'm not going to she's fantastic in this film she's someone who's also haunted by the demons of her past and some present-day mistakes too she's a warrior a protector just like that Charlize Theron would be to me in real life if my girlfriend shaved her head like Charlize Theron we would have serious relationship issues that would not be okay with that she only has one hand the other is mechanical if I have a mechanical hand you know what I use that for I don't know where these jokes are coming from but she kicked some serious ass in this film this film actually has a lot of badass females you got young badass females middle-aged badass females and even elderly badass females it's like the fine brothers show except with kicking ass instead of reacting with Charlize Theron I really bought her as his character you know to see Charlize Theron on-screen I were usually like it's Charlize Theron she's really beautiful and yeah she's a great actress but I'm still aware as you saw at least there and I really liked how she went all out with this she was not the most attractive in this film but her ability to like transform into this badass one-handed lady was [ __ ] dope but the true scene stealer for me was Nicholas Hoult like I keep saying I'm not gonna give much away they don't say whose characters in the trailer but Nicholas Hoult performance man that's the one you're gonna walk away thinking about like a plum introduction he seems like oh okay he's just another crazy Mad Max villain with each scene he gets they give him more and more to do and you explored him actually more than you would even explore max of this film the film was great too for doubt the character's name don't know the actor's name but I like the villains motives in this film it was different from the other villains that's that's actually what I like about this whole franchise the first Mad Max the gangsters are like serial killers on wheels the road warrior had villains that were like tribal territorial savages in a way this one is more like a cult it's like a civilization ruled by evil religious thinking so I like how the characters are always like [ __ ] crazy but they always have a different type of thing about them the music of this film is wonderful it really does get your heart going I love the editing of this film I love like the man craziness the kinetic energy that just the camera angles and the editing bring to the film I'll be honest I strongly do prefer the first half over the last half that's not to say the last half is bad it's just the last half had like one or two small moments that seemed to drag a little bit and the actions started seeming a little repetitive but then again there's just so much [ __ ] action that I don't even know actually if it was repetitive it might have been different it's just so much in your face that you know it's like what was that different than what I saw so yeah if you don't walk away thinking about the characters necessarily you will not forget the action in this film it's so cool because it's from the same writer director of the original Mad Max but he like really updated it like he's been paying attention to films over the last 30 years and I feel like in a lot of ways this has some of the best moments of the entire franchise because those action scenes are like cleverly choreographed at what school is that yes there's some CGI here and there but it's mainly practical effects and like crazy stuntmen and at the end of the day it has just enough character to provide the emotional depth to support the action scenes let me get straight to the point here all in all I gotta say Mad Max fury road got it manically right alright guys checking out my interview for Mad Max fury road you can go ahead and follow us on Facebook Instagram and Twitter last but not
