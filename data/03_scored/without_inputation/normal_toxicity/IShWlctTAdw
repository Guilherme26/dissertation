Nihao and welcome back to interpreting the stars where today we're taking a look at,0.13691641
another foreign film the farewell although I think it was a technically an American production,0.07831619
but a majority of it is spoken in the Mandarin language now the reason for,0.03703749
which I'm reviewing this film is basically the same reason that I reviewed parasite a,0.35227323
few days ago right because there is an overwhelming amount of hype surrounding this movie,0.06848485
for whatever reason and you know what again I would have to agree with a,0.05310388
majority of that hype I wouldn't necessarily say that I loved it as much as,0.052589715
everybody else because of technical things which I will get into soon but I did,0.14071082
think that it was masterfully performed and now let's get into it so the farewell,0.10200065
focuses on a Chinese family some of them live in China some in Japan and,0.07786446
some in America when they learned that their grandmother 9'i is dying soon due to,0.241457
stage 4 cancer they all come together to celebrate her life before she passes the,0.43382642
thing about it is they're all lying about why they're there in the first place,0.25447378
they claim to be visiting China because somebody in the family is getting married and,0.08480623
they choose to instead carry the burden of not his impending death so that she,0.26249728
can enjoy the time they have together the first thing I want to talk about,0.07622788
with the farewell is everybody's performance this is probably the best acting that I've seen,0.038856026
in any given foreign language film and to be honest it's better than a lot,0.10430057
of movies spoken in my native tongue it's all about how these people have layers,0.11816411
upon layers of hidden emotion at the prospect of their grandmother's diagnosis and how each,0.05759316
of them are deeply conflicted about keeping it a secret it seems wrong and possibly,0.123802744
even legal if it were in the US but they also want to keep her,0.088129446
happy and enjoying life as long as humanly possible it does such a fantastic job,0.11051045
breaking down the fact that everybody is different and experiences emotions differently some can keep,0.059037104
their cool better than others who have a hard time not breaking down a bit,0.18472208
every given opportunity acting like you're set and crying all the time is something that's,0.36688638
already difficult to do as an actor acting like you're hardly keeping yourself together on,0.34545943
the other hand is unimaginably difficult and everybody in this film pulled it off if,0.14322291
I was rating this movies solely on the perform and nothing else I doubt my,0.056759924
score would be anything other than a perfect 100% because everything about these people was,0.18076934
real believable relatable in a million different ways instead I want to talk about maybe,0.08247837
some things that I don't think always worked as well as it should have before,0.05764487
I see a movie I look at the Johnna online which I suppose might be,0.06421903
a bad idea because you can have expectations that won't be met this film is,0.15546621
listed as a comedy-drama and to be honest I think it was 97 percent drama,0.1510168
it is light-hearted and bittersweet because the lie that these people are living but it,0.24748076
was primarily dramatic above all else so I was expecting more of a balance between,0.07697709
comedy and drama and that's not what I got also narrative Lee speaking this film,0.14790216
follows a very simple plot which isn't a bad thing but the point was to,0.05009479
be near their grandmother which they all show up in the first 10 to 15,0.14411175
minutes or so so the real story goal is accomplished more or less in the,0.07714024
beginning the rest of the movie is carrying out the life and there's not much,0.098969236
focus on the wedding story to be honest so there's not really many obstacles in,0.059500564
their way there's really only one obstacle which is basically to keep it together for,0.06613586
nine I again this is a character study which is fantastic but there's not a,0.0655774
ton of narrative that being said the cinematography in the film was particularly impressive at,0.046204742
any given moment there were really beautiful shots in this film that invoked the emotional,0.14238758
response that you can tell that it was definitely going for as well as a,0.05558056
really impressive musical score that is light-hearted at times and haunting at others I was,0.046190213
even humming along with the score because honestly it's that good and I wouldn't mind,0.08303615
listening to it outside of the film itself so what did I rate this film,0.064214
80 percent 80 out of 100 possible stars grinning at the letter grade of B,0.088810876
- which is actually very similar to the score that I gave to parasite so,0.325008
it's a great year for foreign language Fell's because I also like fury which came,0.07452505
