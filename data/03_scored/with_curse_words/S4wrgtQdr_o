hello everyone today i will be reviewing a night at the opera so a night,0.14714037
at the opera came out in 1935 and was directed by sam wood and this,0.073711134
film is a comedy and stars the marx brothers this was actually the first marx,0.1260853
brothers film to not star zeppo so this film has the three main marx brothers,0.11128285
in it who are groucho chico and harpo and this film is actually about these,0.32752135
two opera stars rosa and rodolfo and they go aboard this ocean liner on the,0.07173486
way to the united states of america and in fact most this film is actually,0.062075485
set on board this ocean liner we also have this other opera star who's known,0.05967023
as ricardo and he is in love with rosa but obviously when all this is,0.1038631
happening we also have the marx brothers in the situation as well so groucho marx,0.27245414
he plays this rich man who is um in love with this lady who's played,0.24873237
by margaret dumont and margo dumont actually appears in quite a lot of the marx,0.27849478
brothers films we also get chico marx who plays ricardo's manager and then we get,0.096718274
harpo marks he plays rodolfo's dresser and since rodolfo is not a very nice guy,0.15268105
poor harpo gets treated quite badly in this film so this was the first time,0.17105758
i'd ever seen this film and it's actually only the second marx brothers film i've,0.09224219
seen the other marx brothers film i've seen is duck soup and when i'm comparing,0.14939727
this to duck soup in all honesty this isn't quite as good as duck soup,0.22170961
though it is a very funny film duck suit is very wacky and crazy and,0.5045439
the plot in that film is a bit ridiculous to be honest whereas the plot,0.586039
in this film is actually fairly realistic and you can really see this happening as,0.06006072
a proper story even if the markzwares weren't in it but nevertheless the marx brothers,0.09037187
do bring a lot of humor to this film and it's a very enjoyable watch,0.13747433
and there are loads of brilliant jokes scattered throughout this film particularly with groucho marx,0.19242583
he has lots of witty one-liners as he does in all his films he really,0.31089434
is the vocal comedy aspect of the film in terms of actually tenon jokes obviously,0.050524782
harpo marx is a mute so a lot of his comedy is very physical with,0.49114102
the way he is acting and chico marx is always there in the background or,0.095519796
at the front um having a laugh and making a few jokes and being an,0.12246237
excellent presence on screen so all together there are actually lots of funny bits throughout,0.0962
this film i think possibly my favorite scene in the film is when they're aboard,0.08509221
the ocean liner and poor old groucho marx he is stuck in this tiny room,0.5080346
and the room just has a bed and and a giant suitcase and that's about,0.18776871
it and a tiny sink in the corner and all of a sudden it turns,0.24700305
out that chico and harpo and also um ricardo they have smuggled into a suitcase,0.112301685
and then they all appear in the room so there's these four guys in this,0.084593035
tiny little room all of a sudden someone knocks the door an engineer comes in,0.15072247
then and then afterwards a manicure comes in and then some waiters come in to,0.12172743
deliver the food and all of a sudden this room is really crowded everyone is,0.0709681
jumping on top of each other climbing everywhere it's a really funny scene and then,0.18350525
margaret dumont's character knocks on the door i open it and everybody spills out onto,0.193655
the floor and obviously it's it's a very physical joke so it's very funny as,0.1537517
you watch it on screen and it's certainly one of the highlights of the film,0.085000746
another brilliant scene is when this man is searching for chico and harpo because they're,0.18062843
basically stowed away illegally and they're hiding and he's looking around these rooms everywhere trying,0.24192487
to find him and all of a sudden these characters they are having to move,0.092009954
the beds out of the way and go outside on the balcony and come back,0.079430595
in again and just the way this whole sequence is arranged is really clever and,0.06415418
it must have been really well thought out you can certainly tell when you're watching,0.06258973
a marx brothers films that a lot of the jokes are actually very intelligent and,0.18578629
are all just put in the exact right place and they'll end up working together,0.07182561
so well in in the context of the story so like i said earlier the,0.047054995
the story in this is actually fairly realistic and it's quite clever the way they,0.060881283
manage to work these jokes in and also create a very believable story with some,0.050016414
excellent humor in it now as i did say i do prefer duck soup and,0.13439603
i think the jokes in duck soup tend to just stand out a bit more,0.2413498
in my mind there are so many funny jokes in duck soup in this film,0.24191439
there are lots of funny jokes there's just not quite as many big jokes or,0.082575105
not um not quite as many memorable sequences as there are in duck suit from,0.17644
what i can remember watched it last night i enjoyed it quite a bit however,0.14686413
it just didn't have that extra push that duck soup has and although if i'm,0.18266438
being honest although zeppo was in duck soup he didn't have a massive part in,0.15566796
that film anyway so perhaps this film wasn't necessarily missing zeppo and it certainly had,0.075696185
lots of jokes in it and this film also tries to do the um romantic,0.051702216
subplot as well like a lot of the marx brothers films do but this film,0.17833866
actually manages to work their romantic subplot um into the story very well and in,0.07334909
fact there are actually quite a few scenes in this film that don't have the,0.0813943
marx brothers in at all they just have rosa and ricardo and they're actually singing,0.1479959
to each other while one is on the boat and one is down below and,0.11467982
these scenes are obviously opera which obviously comes from the title night at the opera,0.15392224
in general the marx brothers films do have musical elements to them there's this excellent,0.084381
sequence on the ship when ricardo is singing this song um kosikosa and it's a,0.08137396
very catchy song when everybody is singing along to it so overall i have to,0.0868536
say a night of the opera a really good comedy um one of the best,0.09533351
classic comedies of all time really not as good as duck soup in my opinion,0.27087346
however still very amusing and still a very good comedy i always am surprised by,0.11275567
how well the jokes and marx brothers film hold up nowadays bear in mind this,0.082417704
film is 85 years old so obviously some of it will seem dated obviously but,0.07971554
actually a lot of the jokes they still made me laugh and i had a,0.08541147
very good time having said that it's probably not necessarily one of the films i,0.07798886
would come back to straight away as a classic comedy for some reason doesn't quite,0.3038865
stand out in my mind as much as ones like duck soup nevertheless i do,0.27870184
recommend it and it's an excellent comedy so i'm going to give a night of,0.24250942
the opera a rating of 8 out of 10. it's a fantastic comedy and well,0.11184609
worth seeing so if you enjoy these old classic comedies this is definitely one that,0.12223929
has to be watched so there we go so that is my review of a,0.059864778
night at the opera so what do you guys think have you seen the night,0.07113591
