without beeps Tony,0.10694106
Baker here back for another movie review and this time we're reviewing a quiet place co-written and directed by John Krasinski from the office Jim from the offices making horror movies out here man and he got his wife and there's the coast on man Emily Blunt how cool is it to make a movie with your spouse,0.16251276
and the reviews have been great about it made fifty million dollars opening weekend way over expectations they were expecting it to do 30 48 kept climbing throughout the weekend fifty million dollars a good premise,0.030967511
and a good review goes a long way back the story is about they don't really give too much on the origin of these creatures but apparently they I don't know how much of the population they wiped out they leave that pretty vague but these creatures are extremely sensitive to sound so if you make a noise they're coming for you and these creatures come for you fast,0.19405031
you make a noise you better run hide and just lay down is it looking for you you know horror movies have been doing that lately and like they've been doing the less is more approach,0.21632227
let's terrify the audience by not really showing them too much,0.10188871
I'm done with that let me know how it happened,0.079194434
when it happened,0.051794693
and what they look like stop hiding these creatures,0.31089434
I hate when they hide the creatures,0.2822222
I'm done with that just because it worked for Jaws doesn't mean it's gonna work for every horror movie Jaws isn't working,0.10218252
I know why they did it for Jaws it's cuz,0.07138698
it was too complicated to show you this mechanical shark they had brewing so they kept everything under the surface cuz,0.11754612
I watched the first 10 minutes of the Steven Spielberg documentary and he told us that's why you see less of the shark and luckily it paid off a lot of filmmakers like let's do,0.06302414
let's do the Jaws approach,0.0677387
it just terrifying with anticipation,0.1143222
I'm done with it show me these monsters show me the money yeah a quiet place,0.41401237
they show you the monster they show you the money,0.57342786
yeah there's some anticipation they'll do right away,0.10061682
but they show you the monsters which I unlike thank God and it's just about the family,0.35620943
you know Jim and Pam I'm calling Emily Blunt Pam in this situation,0.11491897
it's like the office spin-off,0.08294703
they said different actresses playing Pam now they got kids and they living kind of like you know in a nice home in like a little country house the Dayton set up for themselves you got a family you're just trying to stay alive you're just trying to stay quiet stay alive so these creatures won't get you and your family he did a good job and just creating tension creating that if we were in that situation what would we do,0.11941412
and there's not a lot of dialogue as you could expect,0.12599084
they can't talk,0.091620065
I appreciated that I appreciate a movie that's quiet,0.092736766
the only thing is you can hear people snacking people were snagging to do,0.180563
but whoever was behind us was really digging in that popcorn like if the monsters that it truly existed and they couldn't hit a movie screen,0.13830262
but they could hear the audience oh he would have got scooped up mid,0.05735342
port of popcorn in your hand if the movie is mad silent,0.1945302
okay,0.050967902
we heard every crunch every bag did or just that one person everybody else on the would they were doing,0.16721646
but it was the guy behind it god,0.1192241
I think he was nervous even though I got a dig at this bag me and my girlfriend we snug anja Poulet hopefully AFC's not watching this review we snuck in some Chipotle,0.2161077
I ate it fast in the beginning because I knew it was gonna be quiet,0.120497786
so you know when the trailers started and then in the theater,0.053041916
god,0.064331464
am I gonna get my rice beans and guacamole I ate it fast and plus you know I didn't want,0.11962477
I don't want people looking is that that's not regular movie tomato Chipotle ain't well nobody,0.2356585
seeing nothing,0.08343544
you know,0.07163658
I was looking at the person next to me the old time like that he doesn't see here,0.101617895
ain't nothing to see here,0.15398803
but back to a quiet place you cared about the family that's all I ask man let me care,0.08744842
about the people in peril,0.06799517
then we good to go,0.05734889
yeah I got an order the couple characters but you know this it comes with the territory the monsters that they do show they were scared like the monsters were scared,0.28965718
and if you're gonna have a movie you gotta be scared of the creature,0.27537337
and hey and I was like man,0.12401371
these preachers are scary to look at alright,0.43825158
now the question is a lot of times when when horror movie set up this this lovely premise in this awesome world and they run out of steam at the end is that the case for quiet,0.099437155
please,0.054873075
I was satisfied with the end because they explained the situation and then you know you got to figure out how to do what you got to do to survive once they figured it out,0.060986396
everything else made sense,0.06209136
the question is we don't know how big the world is,0.094635084
so there's room for you know more but I don't know,0.092119865
but I was satisfied with it,0.064944476
they didn't run out of steam,0.074854255
at the end takeaways from the film,0.07959086
I don't need a lot of dialogue to enjoy a movie I don't need a lot of talking man,0.24204348
so movies they over talk and when characters talk too much you start not to like them,0.12955424
and then you don't care if they live or die,0.69542736
if everybody is pretty much quiet,0.07525119
you're kind of kid you can't feel sorry for them,0.40339145
it's like how you feel sorry for your dog,0.31089434
you can't,0.11261664
they don't talk,0.0995628
I mean dogs bark annoying with your life,0.670844
but they don't talk,0.082114376
so you always kind of like them,0.10980294
yeah I like these creatures,0.118867144
because they don't talk,0.096831076
they don't say the wrong thing then they'll say racist stuff,0.31089434
they don't say sexist things to you know really piss you all they don't diss your religion,0.7093121
it's just your companions,0.12574227
and this was silent movie characters the light didn't like pets like man,0.15214741
I really hate for something happen to you guys then with some happy,0.37022597
you like my dog,0.53391355
another take away show us the goods show us these monsters,0.56036144
and we'll like it,0.070491835
you don't have to do the jaws,0.23972507
and the jaws approach doesn't work for every movie,0.06735837
especially if you're gonna hide the creatures like say signs or like even they were doing with the latest Godzilla movie hide,0.12362736
if you're gonna reveal the monster the payoff better be huge don't wait and reveal them,0.27350548
and then they look like some CGI a middle school kid created for his computer class it better be worth the review I'm just glad that paczynski shoulder Steve monster so much yes thank you put us in that situation in situations man,0.33301955
