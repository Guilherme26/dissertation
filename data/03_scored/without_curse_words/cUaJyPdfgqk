wow what a time to be a horror fan I'm not even a huge horror,0.32530528
fan but you know what I'm gonna come over and join you guys because these,0.15563905
smart high-quality productions are not only impressive but wildly entertaining I'm talking about get out,0.1639888
it and now a quiet place and you know what I'm gonna throw 10 Cloverfield,0.4604011
Lane and split in there too and you know who produced a quiet place Michael,0.063334465
freakin Bay he actually produces a lot of horror movies he's behind the purge franchise,0.5020904
now he does that one with Jason Blum and you might think well it's all,0.073384024
blum but this is Bay you know you know Bay's the main producer here through,0.088512644
his company Platinum Dunes so clearly creatively there's more to him than meets the eye,0.1059185
but the person who is really going to benefit from this movie as they should,0.08613363
is Jim from the office he's directing he's co-writing he's co-starring and well I wouldn't,0.10488771
say he's an auteur director I wasn't aware of his creative vision so much while,0.14427468
watching the movie but after having seen it you realize his ability to deliver a,0.08171389
slick complete and profound horror package that's right profound is mighty impressive and I would,0.23983416
actually put his movie on par with those other films I just listed and I,0.15402009
hope that it enjoys the same success and recognition and I think it will because,0.106082
the buzz from this for this movie coming out of South by Southwest where it,0.10485545
premiered has been anything but quiet however when the movie starts you're going to think,0.14609589
that I have lied to you because the first half of this film is super,0.29952574
slow and by the time John Krasinski and his real-life wife Emily Blunt were slow,0.34306714
dancing in silence I was like those South by Southwest people lied to me but,0.24087688
then after the movie is over you might think well I don't care how good,0.17990755
the second half is grace that first half should have been so boring but here's,0.22058098
the thing you realize that slow quiet first half of the movie was to prepare,0.16807637
you for the roller-coaster ride that is the second half of the movie which is,0.09295203
honestly one of the most terrifying movies I have ever seen I know I don't,0.12933771
have a high threshold for being able to take scares to be honest with you,0.07863688
but this is this movie I couldn't even look at the screen most of the,0.07012589
time I was like I'm just gonna listen to it I was so scared I,0.11355162
can't stress how much this movie had me in its grip and I loved it,0.10503557
I had a very good time now for instance I couldn't understand how this family,0.08600533
was able to keep quiet especially from the jump scares in the movie like John,0.109339304
Krasinski was like oh I'm gonna go look out this window and see if there's,0.12616512
a monster outside of it now I was like how are you gonna keep from,0.38138303
screaming when his head pops up right I mean I would just have duck I,0.4378133
would just duck and cover and like a little hole and be like what I,0.44454768
don't hear them anymore I'll come out this family had amazing self-control I mean I,0.16452238
guess under the circumstances they had to but I mean the movie really really will,0.07245177
make you think could I keep quiet these circumstances but again that's how much it,0.12156733
got me now why is the movie so successful why is it self to have,0.07002959
fine well I have three reasons that I think is the answer now the first,0.064809635
is that the monsters that are hunting them are not only very well designed but,0.41328654
also fairly well realized VFX wise this movie costs just 17 million to make and,0.062219873
I'm convinced that a very large portion of that was spent on visual effects they,0.048616555
are in the caliber of the highest blockbuster and like you really get to see,0.08550677
them on screen - this isn't like oh there's a monster elbow I mean they,0.38944978
do that too but eventually like you get full monster and well some of their,0.4435954
behavior doesn't make sense when you think about it and we'll discuss it in the,0.0781336
spoiler review it never occurred to me while I was watching the movie I was,0.116552204
really impressed and blown away I mean it was great stuff and even now that,0.14566693
I realized some problems with it I still wouldn't take points off the movie because,0.08111379
it didn't occur to me while I was watching it was really good alright then,0.088349216
- this movie uses the domino effect brilliantly like a seemingly small mistake triggers a,0.0935057
series of increasingly bigger ones and bigger problems very much like real life this family,0.13343027
made a lot of mistakes we'll talk about the family momentarily so the first half,0.07011461
is a lot about setting up those dominoes to fall for the second half so,0.06613586
think about that setting up dominoes boring watching them all fall quickly exciting that's how,0.24042715
you have to feel about the first half of the movie they needed to do,0.07188381
the work now three the quiet the quiet actually works because I think it pulls,0.08973344
you in closer to the story it's like when someone's like come closer and then,0.09129765
they go boo and you jump because you know put you in that in that,0.4975822
moment I think that's why I think that's what amplifies the scares because you think,0.10520098
about it you're like I've seen scary movies kind of in the same vein before,0.43064943
where monsters are chasing people around and on a farm but the quiet I think,0.20546202
just makes everything so much more heightened so you're more vulnerable to eventually being scared,0.15498163
out of your damn mind now luckily nobody in my theater because it was a,0.88824683
press screening and they had security watching us like hawks not to have our phones,0.07663128
on so nobody made any noise but there was a crucial moment during the movie,0.074498154
when John Krasinski and Emily Blunt were actually able to have a conversation and a,0.07326159
whispered conversation and some people outside the theater decided to have really loud discussion I,0.06905258
mean it wasn't their fault they didn't know it was playing inside and I think,0.0939675
you know they were just talking normal normal voice well actually they were a little,0.11262506
bit loud but you know a regular movie had been playing inside our theater it,0.2657698
wouldn't have been a problem but here they were kind of like background noise during,0.080801874
this crucial moment so I worry about people having a good viewing experience with this,0.0870755
movie like going into it I thought it would be fun if people made jokes,0.12921838
and chimed in and said a bunch of stuff during the beginning of the movie,0.060774382
but now that I think about how important it is to get you to that,0.06932249
place to experience the the second half maybe that one to keep you keep that,0.0789994
from happening so I think that if you when you go into this movie and,0.12530822
I of course highly recommend that you do you might want to consider a matinee,0.13552953
or even a morning show and maybe even paying extra for a premium theater just,0.049445305
doing whatever you can to make sure you're with an audience that's going to appreciate,0.07779613
this and want to have the experience as it's meant to be and not you,0.16333511
know mess it up just because you know they're not taking it too seriously so,0.110467106
that in addition to this movie being terrifying here's another warning for you it is,0.15381199
extremely sad Wow like it actually made me burst into tears what's really surprised me,0.22247538
I was like am i crying what does I didn't like the family very much,0.11685688
but in fact I almost was like this is too sad like I was really,0.08708084
sad but you know what if you're gonna list it if John Krasinski can elicit,0.14872596
that kind of emotional reaction for me again for characters I did not really like,0.057724483
well then I have to say kudos to him now why didn't I like the,0.05755946
family again no spoilers but they not only did they make like we're in a,0.06454011
horror movie mistakes like if they didn't make mistakes there'd be no movie obviously right,0.18136185
you know like oh yeah and they did everything perfectly good job family but all,0.06745706
so there are very bland and devoid of defined personalities like so often you know,0.14880992
one thing I'll say to you is that you know there's an argument about what,0.095007755
child can do what chores on the farm and it there do they seem to,0.080161795
be dividing it along gender lines and you would think that you know in a,0.25446856
modern film you know this is supposed to take place in the near future that,0.108740106
the daughter would be like really post-apocalyptic gender rules are you kidding me with this,0.26104537
you know look like the only people practically left on earth who cares don't worry,0.32803532
I didn't spoil anything so you know you would think that the conversations never went,0.07578204
to that kind of real personal level like the characters didn't feel like real people,0.07126847
in many ways and then also for instance emily Blunt's character at the beginning of,0.009952555
the movies pregnant so again not a spoiler and you're like well why would anyone,0.19696245
have a baby in this situation but they never discussed the pros and cons like,0.12514903
I would have loved for them to be like maybe this is a John Connor,0.05088351
baby and we hate we have to have it you know but the you know,0.31089434
the more we'll talk about this all a lot in the spoiler review but thinking,0.117082424
about it after I saw the movie last night I think that maybe that was,0.06739731
intentional as well though to make the family more ciphers so you can imagine yourself,0.1487716
in this situation and I did do that as I said I was like could,0.045136962
I stay quiet in this situation and I think maybe giving them more personality would,0.14963329
have made the experience less intimate and kept the audience at more of a distance,0.06664531
so I'm still breaking this movie down in my head as to why it worked,0.37004992
so well why it's so effective but what I am sure of is that it,0.06436048
is incredible it is an incredibly well-constructed movie like Wow probably not since inception has,0.075719394
a film been able to manipulate me emotionally and mentally to exactly where it wants,0.2716479
me now inception for instance made me question reality for a few days that's impressive,0.078849055
but I didn't love the film because ultimately I thought it relied on cheap tricks,0.093912385
but a quiet place I think because maybe it's a smaller film it created such,0.16254753
an emotional intimate experience and it both terrified and made me very sad that it,0.11687148
really got me I think this is just a really well made film I mean,0.102629565
crits like almost like a magic trick I'm not impressed with that so yeah don't,0.15424033
miss this movie it's very special and protect your movie going experience with this really,0.084098786
think ahead be like this family how are you gonna make sure that you learn,0.089051254
oh you're in an audience it stays quiet I almost wished they would make an,0.07339075
announcement being like you might be tempted to chime in but you got to trust,0.24247177
the movie and go with it or you're not gonna really experience it the way,0.15309395
it's meant to you're not gonna you're not gonna be able to experience that magic,0.18747005
trick and yes John Krasinski is definitely a triple threat to keep an eye on,0.19128957
going forward hey Jim I'm so happy for him look for awhile like he wasn't,0.13858645
gonna make it let's see how his uh his uh Jack Ryan serious is on,0.15449266
Amazon but anyway that's my review of a quiet place be sure to share your,0.0874031
own thoughts down below if you've seen the movie do not spoil it please again,0.09419823
what people experienced that magic trick save your comments for the spoiler review and of,0.060318574
