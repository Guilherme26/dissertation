widely referenced films of all time it's so popular and so influential that it's essentially,0.036671575
become a phrase well you know that movie was pretty good but it wasn't Citizen,0.02954014
Kane or anything or you know I wasn't expecting it to be Citizen Kane it,0.024965672
was alright or that film is the Citizen Kane of crime dramas it's so well,0.042926297
known that it's become a part of our pop culture it's become a part of,0.04196843
the way we speak Morrison Welles directed the film he stars in it he took,0.026768321
part in the screenplay and the producing the production of the film was historic at,0.008504373
the time because he was mostly known for his theater work and that's where he,0.018512726
felt most comfortable and that's where he really wanted to maintain himself but Hollywood kept,0.0147710685
trying to court him and get him to make films for them and he took,0.09213591
part in a very controversial contract that essentially gave him complete creative control final cut,0.02013777
everything they couldn't have people on set despite the fact that RKO Pictures would sometimes,0.029153004
try to get people on set to see what they were doing he had so,0.022209818
much control something that was unprecedented at the time especially for someone as young as,0.043777067
he was this film in every way could have been a complete financial and critical,0.037572235
disaster and yet it has endured as a classic of our times for some though,0.056263894
Citizen Kane can be a very daunting film to watch or talk about in fact,0.032691114
for me sitting here it's rather imposing just to just make a review of it,0.03226407
because so many other people have analyzed this film from back to front for decades,0.028372744
there's really nothing new that I can say about the movie I can simply tell,0.025130639
you my experience with it and how I've come to really love the film because,0.033583127
when I was younger and I saw it for the first time I just really,0.018867934
didn't get it it didn't really mesh with me you hear so much about this,0.021181444
film and so many people hype it up endlessly it's constantly on lists as one,0.03681193
of the best films of time or the best film ever made many well-known critics,0.06042794
have named it their favorite film and so you sit down expecting to be transported,0.099363804
away to a world in which you are so blown away that you can no,0.17673863
longer speak and you're so hyped and you're so ready and it's just a really,0.085758135
technically well-made film that's masterfully directed and so impressive for what Orson Welles had going,0.030118851
for him at the time in regards to what he had done before or what,0.048131358
he had not done before on a technical level cinematography music this being Bernard Herrmann's,0.027531287
first film score acting story structure it's unprecedented for its time and easily my favorite,0.020849517
film of the 1940s it's such an incredibly well made movie but I can totally,0.05065839
understand how anyone would watch this and say I mean it's good but like why,0.03720572
is everyone say this is the best movie ever made it's kind of boring like,0.045820512
I can totally see people thinking that because it does not follow common story structure,0.046753097
it's not like a enthralling story so to speak it's not like you sit and,0.08011073
watch like 12 Angry Men and you get so invested in these characters despite the,0.06770705
fact that it is an excellent character study and you can look at its story,0.010970874
and its depiction of that excess and see it so many times today a thousand,0.047714952
times over in various celebrities as I was watching the film most recently a couple,0.023443732
days ago to prepare for this review I thought a lot about Michael Jackson and,0.027793368
his Neverland Ranch filled with animals his pet chimpanzee all of the money and random,0.49973372
things he would buy he would buy statues he essentially was a modern-day Citizen Kane,0.031550325
but it's understandable that anyone might watch this film and just not appreciate it because,0.07335778
it's been hyped so much and it's very dangerous for a film to to gain,0.05816033
such notoriety because you watch it expecting to be transported to another planet or something,0.089558996
and it's just a really damn great movie that was far ahead of its time,0.21068694
in regards to what it was trying to do Orson Welles later said one of,0.042507894
my favorite quotes about filmmaking ever when someone asked him how he was so audacious,0.027849244
enough to make a film like this at that point in his life he said,0.047391675
ignorant sheer ignorance you know there's no confidence to equal it it's only when you,0.48253766
know something about a profession I think that you're timid or careful which is so,0.0401292
true when I was a kid making short films we didn't think about the meaning,0.054524437
we didn't wonder what people might think of what we were making because we just,0.042120095
wanted to make it and we didn't care as much about like a response to,0.029533489
it we weren't psychoanalyzing every little thing to make sure that what we were doing,0.048680134
wouldn't potentially be awful we just really wanted to get our vision out there even,0.05095373
if it was really amateur and bad Orson Welles though coming from that theater background,0.08720425
knew how to tell a story and knew how to put something together and he,0.031197779
knew how to make something different that Hollywood hadn't seen at the time I mean,0.025056137
just the fact that the film allows the audience to become a part of the,0.016568394
narrative like early on with the news on the march sequence where we're learning about,0.013024961
the life of Charles Foster Kane we're hearing about his background how he was raised,0.0224566
his Millions his various relationships this was a very unorthodox approach to storytelling and story,0.018603856
structure people I think at first were kind of confused by the movie and it,0.06403324
took a long time for the world to realize how influential the movie actually was,0.026162338
now yes there's a major plot hole in the film that has been discussed a,0.04118152
lot the fact that the film opens with Charles Foster Kane dying and saying the,0.021303171
word rosebud and then starts the entire basic story of the movie this reporter who's,0.04873069
attempting to figure out what rosebud means and so he's visiting all these figures that,0.042026967
were integral to Kane's life trying to figure out if he can get a great,0.044440918
story to publish about what rosebud means the plot hole being that he died alone,0.15109913
and no one was around and so we're kind of left to believe that perhaps,0.029202227
hit one of his maids or Butler's may have heard him say this and there's,0.16430235
elements to the movie that you can say well that's not good that's not good,0.050613824
there's too much exposition for instance or maybe some of the performances are a little,0.010583072
hammy at times but you just cannot deny the fact that this movie was leaps,0.07758037
and bounds ahead of every other film in its time this movie does not feel,0.03688909
like a movie that was released in 1941 it feels like a film that could,0.026128413
have been made today if you strip away the obvious technical stuff the black and,0.21560797
white and some of the sound and things that obviously identify the time period the,0.062670276
filmmaking the precise cinematography use of cross dissolves the way everything flows so smoothly the,0.035436995
way he moves in the camera in someone when they're having an angry moment or,0.06234633
pulls back when there's a softer moment on display Orson Welles was ahead of his,0.03894717
time he was a perfectionist like all great filmmakers one of his great annoyances with,0.052899394
the movie was that during the snowy scenes early on despite the fact they look,0.026900027
really good you couldn't see the actors breath because it was shot in a studio,0.2711789
and that pissed him off because he's a perfectionist he wants it to be as,0.3057729
good as it can be which is a sign of an excellent filmmaker and and,0.021400288
you can watch this in Kane today and say well I didn't really appreciate that,0.019623583
that wasn't for me and I would understand that because the first time I saw,0.057199806
it when I was younger I didn't really get it it just wasn't for me,0.03672745
but as I got older I kept being drawn to it and I wanted to,0.023219565
see it again I had similar experiences with Blade Runner for instance didn't really appreciate,0.0152972285
the movie on first viewing but it just kept festering in my mind and Citizen,0.05492621
Kane is one of those movies and you really can't deny the importance and the,0.020728452
impact fulness of this film I'm gonna give a Citizen Kane and a-plus guys thank,0.07968235
you so much as always for continuing to watch this series of pre-1970s reviews I,0.038522117
have one more to do in December look forward to that as always if you,0.030777382
