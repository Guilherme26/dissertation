what is up guys Stewie and welcome back to another review from the London Film Festival which is feeling even stranger and stranger to say as a month keeps going up to November now,0.05229906
and I still haven't got all of my film festival reviews done I guess,0.06561368
it's a testament to my timekeeping skills which are not good and today we're talking about another film which has got a whole load of buzz where ever it's been shown at festivals in the year,0.095091596
so I naturally went,0.09207585
yep that I'm gonna I'm gonna see it,0.098111875
and that one is portrait of a lady on fire,0.47127095
it's a French romantic film directed by Celine Shama and my goodness gracious,0.029740583
yeah it's fantastic,0.090307444
it's an amazing film I'll keep it brief on the summary for this one but it's essentially the story of a woman who is tasked with painting,0.15213856
a portrait of another woman that doesn't want to have her portrait painted suddenly realize I'm doing a great job of selling this one they they have the love romance you're just gonna have to trust me on this one,0.20468342
and there's not a huge amount else,0.11919828
I can say about the story without going into too many details,0.058683854
which I think might ruin the experience for you just going not knowing much,0.27589178
that's all you need to know that this film is so incredibly effective at telling a romantic story and the relationship between the characters are just so perfectly executed,0.21889761
I mean Celine sciama let's just talk about her direction here which is just stunning,0.17093493
I don't have to throw my hands up here,0.26088253
and say I haven't actually watched any of her previous Direction work,0.0907342
she did a film called girlhood which is one of hers which got a lot of acclaim,0.15829778
when it came out ever saw it,0.07602066
though I'm terrible but she has written other films which I have seen she was actually the writer behind one of my favorite animated films the last few years my life is a cause yet if the name made you laugh just watch the film you'll be blown away,0.15014616
I guarantee it,0.05777714
but here there's not really anything,0.07157327
I didn't like about the way she approached this film from what I've seen of her writing work,0.11150888
she was a very effective way of approaching human,0.29670033
relationships and really getting at the heart and humanity of the story and that is absolutely present,0.06280727
here,0.053441156
it's a film which takes a lot of time to just let the characters breathe in their moments which I know can sound incredibly pretentious,0.15002179
but it's not the first pretentious thing I've said on this channel,0.17639275
so we're just going to go with it and it's quite a simple thing but I love the way that she uses a narrative of this and almost as a kind of tool to get at the characters as opposed to the characters being a tool to get the narrative and I just loved every second of watching these characters fall in love with each other and her performances from both the actresses in the lead roles are so so good here stars Adele hon L as the the woman that doesn't want to be painted,0.08965225
she does have her name still gonna say it because I'm not French even better than her roles in films like unknown girl and 128 beats per minute those are good roles,0.25900292
but here she's just something else,0.10513163
she really nailed this character that's got a lot of walls,0.16730413
up when we first meet her but we gradually see her come around to certain things throughout the film alongside her as the painter and I cannot give with the character names,0.05236854
there's no me Merlin,0.23993675
I probably butchered it,0.3132144
and we're gonna go with it,0.034757327
the top my head,0.12991576
I don't think,0.102524914
I've actually seen her in anything before,0.16338336
and she smashed this one she was brilliant and along side her nail the two of them just works,0.35978132
so perfectly in this film cuz you got a really great contrast between the characters one starts off quite cold,0.09135291
one of them is much more softer and warm just sounded like a serial killer saying now but that makes us such an interesting dynamic in their relationship,0.33244467
so as soon as they met I was like yes I want to see this happen it just feels natural and that definitely comes from the two performances,0.10435917
but it's again,0.053581424
one of the great things about sciama as a writer and director she just has a fantastic way of making all of this feel natural feels authentic it feels real it doesn't feel like it's doing anything gimmicky or anything,0.087095134
flashy,0.079836436
it's just a relationship that is perfectly explored through the means of film,0.06246449
and that's where it shares quite a lot for me with a film like call me by your name and I don't want to sort of dismiss,0.15774186
this film is just like a lesbian call me by your name I think to simplify it down to a statement like that it doesn't do this film justice it's so much more than that all that being said there are certain themes and parallels which which are the reason I love a film like call me by name and a reason why I feel like this works,0.535116
so well as well though for them deals,0.07664007
so wonderfully in quite different ways,0.12936692
but similar ways as well with that feeling of falling in love and it's kind of feeling like it's just you and this other person and it's just it's just you two in the world nothing else matters,0.10204498
in fact there's this incredible line in in scamaz film here which deals so wonderfully with that and encapsulate sit also perfectly at one point,0.15102156
one of the character says to the other do all lovers feel like they've invented something new,0.059086997
it's a line which is just stuck with me ever since I saw this film and perfectly encapsulates everything that is so good about this film it's that feeling you get when you're experiencing something so amazing,0.123108335
and so incredible for the first time with someone else how could there be anyone else that knows we're going through here,0.07054192
and I loved that side of the relationship in a way that's explored so perfectly in this film,0.06755683
and there's a certain point from this film in a similar way to call me by name where I realized I was totally in with these characters,0.10699592
I could watch them do anything,0.24933557
and I just feel like everything they're doing and saying to each other just feels so genuine,0.04751389
and I find that incredibly moving it made me feel all kinds of emotions this filled,0.1181628
but what I also found really interesting about this film is that on top of the relationship which is the main bulk of this,0.053631987
and the main thing is going for there are also some really interesting decisions made from a directing point of view which just sort of make a little bit spicy,0.092398785
huh there is moments that almost kind of Teeter on the brink of feeling like we're watching a thriller or some kind of horrors feel strange saying it but and I hope you know what I mean,0.062136758
if you see in a film there's almost this kind of ghost-like presence in a film which I wasn't a hundred percent sure what was happening at the time of seeing it,0.0892487
and then come the end of this film it all just makes sense,0.092302464
and there's a point in the climax where it all comes to a head,0.21193188
and I just I suddenly got why she done that throughout the film and it's just another layer to this film which just elevates it above your bog-standard kind of romantic film ultimately just film did everything right,0.100265816
I absolutely adored it,0.08336809
I can't wait to see it again,0.10559961
it's gorgeous to look at and just in terms of the way it's shot in its cinematography,0.42648685
but on top of that it is,0.05067319
so brilliantly performed and so stunningly directed and written it all just works perfectly it's totally deserving of all the praise it's getting and you have to make sure you go out and see this when it drops wherever you are but what about you guys have you seen portrait of a lady on fire,0.2560689
