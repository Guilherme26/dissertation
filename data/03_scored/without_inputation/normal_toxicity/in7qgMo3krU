thanks for tuning in Eskimo TV your home for icy and chilly movie reviews I'm your host Jason ischaemia and today I'm gonna be talking about one of my favourite films that I've got the chance to see recently eighth grade this film was absolutely spectacular,0.083739296
this movie is about a young girl named Kayla,0.18818408
she likes to record videos and post them online and she likes to talk about a lot of different issues and a lot of different things that she's thinking about related to life,0.12904641
she is finishing her last week of eighth grade and we get to see a lot of different issues that I would say lots of teenagers and maybe probably even adults face in real life issues related to confidence rejection sexual desires,0.51055604
and confusion are all talked about and discussed in this movie and I really enjoyed watching it I thought that Kayla was a very relatable and likable character she is she has lots of things to like about her but she's not perfect and I like that because it didn't make her seem fake all the kids that talked in this movie really feel like,0.10569951
they are the age that they are,0.06767182
there's a lot of movies like darkest minds which is also in theaters currently where you can tell that adults wrote the script for these kids and even though an adult probably wrote the script for the kids that are talking in this movie it didn't feel that way,0.05091648
I really felt like that's how an eighth grader probably talks for the most part it felt very realistic from all the characters from and and not just Kayla,0.13476765
but all the kids that are in this movie I did think the plot was very interesting,0.0951904
even though there's lots of issues that are dealt with I didn't feel like it was very random,0.045982067
I thought that the structure and flow of the story was very,0.030966777
well done the editing in this movie is done extremely well from the way it cuts to different things,0.078363016
while kala is talking on video we don't just see her face talking forever,0.43628344
while she's talking about something we see a scenario,0.10467386
that relates to what she's talking about it shows us something in her life that relates to what she's talking about,0.23981263
so for example she might be making a video on confidence,0.05808174
and instead of us just watching her face,0.17204025
we get to see a scenario where she had to step up even though she didn't feel very confident and do what she's talking about in one of her videos and be that confident person,0.097636335
so I liked the editing in this movie from the cuts and also from the audio editing,0.085673735
there's some very interesting times where the audio just cut in cut out,0.2452077
and I it was done very well that I took note of it I think that the only negative that I had with this movie,0.10971185
and it's not that big of a deal,0.13679661
but I did think that some of the characters that were not Kayla that were supposed to be like the main character weren't very well humanized,0.08903351
it felt like they were just mean for no reason,0.13824047
and I get that there's eighth graders that are gonna be mean for no reason or for a silly reason,0.31089434
but I would have wanted to know more about why they were like that because it just felt very forced,0.07327571
so that way the creators of this movie could push the plot in the direct that they wanted but other than that though I really enjoyed this movie I thought that it was an excellent experience,0.06284426
and I think that if you want to go watch a relatable character and get lost in experiences that I think you'll be able to look at and say man I have felt that way before,0.10138328
- or I know somebody that's felt like,0.08338262
that I think you'll enjoy this movie it's very,0.11313341
current there's lots of technology involved social media wise from Instagram,0.046990663
snapchat they even poke fun of how Facebook is for old,0.34442404
people and I think that this is a very to date,0.075139984
movie I don't know how that'll do viewing this in 10 years but as someone that might want to see a teenager that is going through a lot of things that are relatable as of today I think that it will be very hard to not enjoy this,0.08730234
movie I really liked,0.07243451
it it's a quick hour and 30 minutes that's very well,0.07727928
