the visual version of asmr because i literally   got vsmr right now oh my god tommy's dying though 
hey this is can you hear me oh for [ __ ] sakes   god i started out hating this man and 
now i've cried for him twice oh god his light went out oh god so i thought i probably better record a 
little greeting in the case of my timely death what a funeral i love you three thousand oh my god oh god proof that tony stark has a heart oh my 
heart really hurts you know why i hurt so much   because he did it all out of selflessness 
and i started off thinking that he was the   most selfish [ __ ] that i have ever seen in 
any film or tv show that i had ever seen and   he went out doing something so selfless for the 
rest of the world despite the fact that he has a   family and he and he wanted to he didn't want 
to give that up he made that abundantly clear   but when it came down to it 
tony stark has a heart he does oh man fury it's so good to see fury   oh god i'm such a mess i have no path i do 
have a ride though move it or lose it airbag   oh wow he's gonna go into space that's awesome i 
really want to know the galaxy back together again you should fight one another for 
the honor of leadership oh my god   it's not necessary i got some blasters 
you guys sorry please use knives on board there shall be no knifing one another 
everybody knows who's in charge right yes this is so awkward [ __ ] two one what the heck what the heck he's had oh i know i know what 
he's done he's going back to his skinny self or his child self or his old self i 
don't know anymore oh his old self   i said maybe uh try some of that life 
tony was telling me to get it's beautiful   oh i'm happy for you that makes me really happy 
to hear that's a really good ending for him he's gonna give his suit to him wow now it's bucky's turn to turn old again   then they can be old besties together 
you want to tell me about her no no i don't think i will oh oh oh that makes me really happy 
you got a second chance with a   oh god i love love there's no end credit scenes 
i'm not used to that what's happened that makes   me so sad so it's been a really long day 
it is now 9 53 p.m and i got my hair done   this very day and i got it in memory of gamora 
and i don't know a little part of me thought that   maybe a version of her would still exist but sadly 
gamora is nomura she's definitely nomura just like   the black widow and it does make me sad this 
movie was really sad the first two hours   was super depressing uh you could probably tell 
that whilst i was reacting to it i was in a pretty   somber mood the mood was definitely not 
upbeat i was definitely not feeling as   bubbly and as chirpy as some of the other films 
have made me feel and that was to be expected   because this film is the conclusion of this grand 
story that we've been following along for well   you guys have been following along for 10 years 
i've been following along for a few months now   um and it just came to a close so mixed feelings 
is pretty much a given i think for this one   um the first two hours was a little bit slow 
because we were just kind of catching up with   what was going on it was 23 days after 
infinity war and we were just catching up   on how everybody's feeling five years after they 
first approached tony they actually start making   movements with their new mission pretty sure we 
got to see pretty much every single mcu character   except for probably jane's friends it was really 
nostalgic i can't imagine how you guys would   have felt seeing all of these scenes because 
you had the actual weight that i didn't have   i saw these all very recently so it's not as 
nostalgic for me i'm sure i'll feel nostalgic   after a few more years if i decide to rewatch 
endgame there was definitely a lot to unpack   i feel like everyone including tony had a really 
nice conclusion obviously tony passed away he died   he is no longer a father to his beautiful daughter 
morgan he's no longer a husband to his beautiful   peppa but the way he went out was really noble and 
really honorable and i don't think that anybody   else could have done it he started this amazing 
world with iron man and i really couldn't have   imagined it to go any other way i mean sure maybe 
the hulk could have done it it wouldn't have had   the payoff as it did uh with tony because tony's 
character development has just gone full circle   i could not be more proud of tony and how far he's 
come i do want to talk about thor as well because   i feel like he had definitely the saddest story 
that we've seen he is on his own now he joined the   outcasts the guardians of the galaxy everyone in 
that crew doesn't really have a family or a place   to belong but they belong with each other so i am 
glad that thor got to have a place to belong in   the end because he lost all of his family members 
he lost all of his best friends sif included   and you know how i feel about sif and thor i 
wanted them to have a happy ending and a nice   romance but that never happened and his character 
definitely changed a lot throughout this entire   series we saw him as a very arrogant jerk in the 
first thor movie and then he found love and he   got to experience earth and what it was 
like to be amongst humans and he experienced   loss and he experienced family drama including his 
crazy sister heller and his chaotic brother loki   constantly testing his character i especially like 
how taika waititi made thought a lot less boring   in the third thor film so i certainly appreciated 
his style of directing in that one um i was super   sad to see natasha go the way she did but hawkeye 
has a family he has a wife and natasha as sad as   it is she doesn't really have any of that she was 
quite alone all she really had was the avengers so   i pretty much predicted that natasha would die i 
did not think originally that tony stark would die   i did see someone say that tony stark would die 
because i asked people to give me fake spoilers   i assumed it was a fake spoiler that was 
certainly really unexpected for me i really   liked seeing captain america's conclusion as 
well i really liked the ending clint god as well   and then also seeing ant-man and hope and cassie 
in the end as well embracing there were a lot   of heartwarming moments for sure i love seeing 
wanda again i love seeing captain marvel again   and doctor strange a lot of people showed up to 
do their bit but we didn't get all the screen time   with them so if they happen to be your favorite 
characters you might have been a bit disappointed   but for me i was quite happy with how everything 
panned out it didn't have the comedy element that   some of the other mcu movies have but i think 
that if there was comedy in this or if i had   laughed as much as i did in saito or guardians 
of the galaxy or even avengers the first one it   wouldn't have felt like the conclusion of a huge 
superhero franchise i must say that i didn't think   they would dive into time travel in the quantum 
realm but once ant-man made an appearance and he   came out of the quantum realm and he observed his 
findings and he learned and he came up with this   hypothesis i was like this is starting to make 
sense they might be able to time travel without   the time travel infinity stone and when i was 
wrapping up my infinity war movie reaction   video i was saying something like if there's 
a way they can go back in time or if there's a   way to go to thanos get the time infinity stone 
there might be a way to bring people back and i   wasn't exactly right but they definitely did use 
time to try and save their story and i'm glad they   did it in a less obvious way in a way that tied 
into everything very well and it made a lot of   sense i think the pacing could have been a little 
bit better if i were to rank the avengers infinity   war movie against the avengers endgame movie i'd 
probably say i was more invested in infinity war   just because i really loved the pacing and there 
was comedy there was action there were a lot of   emotional moments it was heavy it was deep and 
thanos won which completely shook me because it   skewed my perception of what a typical superhero 
movie is we've got the superhero genre that   tells us that the hero has a journey and this is 
the way it's meant to be and that didn't happen   in infinity war so it just shocked me to my core i 
was very thrown because i knew that after end game   there was spider-man i did know in my heart of 
hearts that the heroes will end up winning whereas   in infinity war i had no idea and that aspect 
threw me off i think it was infinity war where   i saw everybody dying in the first 10 minutes and 
i was like what the heck is going on whereas with   endgame i was a little bit more prepared and 
more well oiled for the tragedy so those were   my thoughts i'm sorry that it was kind of all over 
the place and so i might not have said everything   that i wanted to say but those were all of my 
thoughts at this very moment after i have watched   endgame they're quite raw i'll probably have more 
things to say about it as time progresses so yeah   let me know what you guys thought of this film
