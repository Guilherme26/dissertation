hey guys here's my review for the shape of water a film directed by Camila,0.12006896
del Toro a film that I was actually kind of very much looking forward to,0.06643708
because I still have a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth after,0.67129004
the crimson peak that was my attempt at sign language I looked it up I,0.05248235
apologized I couldn't find the translation for the book I am and so I apologize,0.063720085
to that but otherwise I actually really liked this movie del Toro was always known,0.06676187
for fantastically visual films he also is always known for very intriguing characters this film,0.11134028
is basically kind of like a quasi sequel but not really a more of an,0.2432749
Amash prequel to the character Beit sapien in the Hellboy movies as there is a,0.031908855
creature who is M phibian who can walk both on land and in water and,0.24146527
just so happens to like eggs but either way this film is actually very good,0.1457675
it does fall a little bit of stereotypes of Adele Toros previous works but the,0.050637554
thing I will also say is this is some of the best character writing he's,0.08132946
ever done Sally Hawkins is fantastic as a character the fact that she is a,0.12917015
mute does not hinder her at all in character development or expressing emotion it's one,0.08474975
of the things I've always loved about watching people who do ASL is that there's,0.07744292
no words physically our vocally being spoken but there's so much emotion that can be,0.05710087
conveyed just in how people move their hands and their faces how they express it,0.0668833
Richard Linklater who I originally thought was like gonna be her father or something in,0.14817302
this film he's not he's actually a completely very unique character the film takes place,0.09784
in the 50s and his character is a quite an interesting sort of situation as,0.029073251
he is a closeted gay who wears the toupee and he's an artist and what,0.58454275
is so interesting about this movie is that there are instances of racial profiling or,0.15267989
just racism with Octavia Spencer's character and other people as well as there is obviously,0.31089434
the homophobia towards Richard Linklater's character and the thing that I liked about it is,0.35411
it wasn't there more so as a statement but it's just how the characters are,0.05637144
written and I like that so much it's because I understand when political statements are,0.05991981
being said but Deltora wasn't really trying to say that he's just giving us really,0.18239197
good characters and of course Michael Shannon wins the award for creepy of the year,0.1175756
again holy he is so creepy in this movie but he's so intriguing his dialogue,0.44195467
is full of such bigotry but you can't help but be someone interested in how,0.3687796
he's going to handle things because the man just does not want to quit and,0.15102105
as the films moving towards this conclusion you can't really help but think he's committed,0.113448076
that's for sure really he's a fantastic antagonist in this film just his interactions with,0.15470923
Sally Hawkins and the rest of the cast it's just so unnerving he is absolutely,0.17133513
horrifying it's like if Buffalo Bill got to be the head of security but he,0.18504448
wasn't a murder at least you knew about it anyways but there are certain scenes,0.13014856
that are incredibly disturbing and very uncomfortable but some of the best ones in terms,0.08839022
of just character development as well is just like wow I can't believe they did,0.078149274
that speaking of which the opening of this movie I admit my eyebrows were raised,0.15359567
because we see how Sally Hawkins go through her normal routine and then she goes,0.15149237
into the bathtub and has a little bit of her time and they just kind,0.26204363
of nonchalantly go over that and is their routine they repeat it again later it's,0.085639246
like oh okay that's another thing I like about what del Toro does of this,0.12932579
movies he doesn't care about this stuff he just like shows it like it's a,0.15271297
regular day and I thought that was great again not forced it's just there and,0.084343486
again that's why I like these characters so much they feel real they don't feel,0.09178984
like stereotypes they don't feel like people who are there for us a message or,0.09077177
a statement they are just very well-written but the creature is pretty cool too the,0.12919173
relationship between him and Sally Hawkins is very endearing if not just a little bit,0.24001004
weird but it's really cool to watch two people come together in a way that,0.20827699
they can only express through themselves the music is fantastic Alexandra do pasta five saying,0.0857149
that correctly does a fantastic job with the soundtrack there's also a lot of classic,0.0760179
songs from the 40s and 50s that I played which is just fantastic del Toro,0.057825897
basically makes a love letter to the 50s with this movie but he does slightly,0.081147484
veer into kind of the stereotype of del Toro's writing mainly the last 20 minutes,0.074195854
I was able to basically call play-by-play while his movies are dark and always kind,0.15027523
of have a sad but slightly happy ending I still enjoyed it I think it,0.09961829
is definitely one of his best movies that he's ever done and it's a film,0.12696859
that should be watched it's pretty ballsy for some of the stuff that it just,0.098033205
not gelatin ligo's over so I enjoy that I appreciate that and I'm I've been,0.08841693
I feel a lot better now I was really kind of little about crimson peak,0.053260244
because that movie sucked in my opinion but this was much more enjoyable this was,0.7093121
very engaging the characters some of the best characters I've seen in film in a,0.032864086
long time Richard Linklater kills it sally hawkins kills it Michael Shannon kills it almost,0.60483414
literally and I just really enjoyed this movie so in the end I'm gonna give,0.08134329
the shape of water is six out of seven it's definitely one of the best,0.06374614
movies of the year I can't believe that both Molly's game and shape of water,0.05333499
