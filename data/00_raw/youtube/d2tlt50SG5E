the shape of water it's fairly common knowledge at this point that writer director Guillermo del Toro is a monster movie fanatic so it shouldn't surprise anyone that the genesis of his movie the shape of water was a childhood viewing of The Creature from the Black Lagoon decades ago as he was watching then six-year-old del Toro found the iconic image of the creature carrying away the woman to be beautiful not horrific and he actually rooted for the creature and woman to end up together spoilers for a 64 year old movie they don't and as he told the crowd when he introduced the shape of water at its world premiere and Telluride back in September and what I said yesterday on his choice it took me 40 something years and 25 years as a filmmaker to correct that cinematic mistake the mistake is corrected in the shape of water via a lonely mute woman named Eliza played by Sally Hawkins in 1962 Baltimore at the height of the Cold War Eliza works as a cleaning lady at a secretive government research lab where one day a no-nonsense government employee named Strickland played by Michael Shannon arrives with the mysterious humanoid and phibian that he captured in the Amazon another reference to the Creature from the Black Lagoon which also lived in the Amazon given her knack for nonverbal communication Eliza is able to build a connection with the fish man referred to as the asset by the scientists who hope to study it once Eliza realizes they intend to kill the asset she enlists the help of her dad on his luck closeted neighbor Giles played by Richard Jenkins to help her save him I think the most important thing to know about the shape of water is that it is a full-blown fairy tale and all that that implies it opens with narration and a visual prologue of sorts if I told you a moaner the princess without voice what would I say and from there it's a fairly traditionally told traditionally structured story basically if you're at all familiar with the typical beats of a screenplay the shape of water has a crystal clear inciting incident crystal clear act breaks a crystal clear midpoint climax and if we're being honest some second acts AG etc mind you there's nothing inherently wrong with this and in fact when you're telling a relatively bizarre story a relationship between a woman and a fish man that is unambiguously consummated it's a good idea to ground it with relatively traditional storytelling and yet I admit I still had trouble buying into the love story portion not that an interspecies of romance is ever an easy sell but particularly when it develops this quickly this isn't a movie about how a woman could possibly fall in love with a fish man it's a movie about a woman who does fall in love with a fish man now what it's sort of speeds past the Fong and love part as a bit of a given for this reason the fact that I had some trouble buying into the thong and love part is less of an issue than you might think it's just one plot point and not the whole point Eliza's pleaded Giles to get him to help her rescue the asset is a fantastic scene my favorite in the movie because regardless of whether the romance is believable her empathy sure as hell is Hawkins is incredible and this scene in particular but she's great in the whole movie as is most of the cast every performer brings a nice specificity to their character which saves some of them from teetering into caricature Michael Shannon in particular walks that line like a goddamn champ he's Malkovich in with his careful deliberate movements but somehow always seems on the brink of exploding though in special mention for Michael Stalberg who reminded me this year that he brings unexpected vulnerability and tenderness to every role even a Russian spy in a cold war movie and even if I didn't love the screenplay to go along with the great performances there's gorgeous cinematography gorgeous music from Oscar frontrunner and past winner Alexander display gorgeous costumes and production design but the two kind of go here because both are infused with a deliberate color scheme and with a touch of intentional artificiality everything in this world looks just a little fake for lack of a better word which both underscores the fairy tale aspect and I think is reminiscent of old Hollywood film sets eliza and giles both live above a movie theater and they're both obsessed with Golden Age Hollywood stars I'm gonna be synchronizing her watches just like they do in the movies from Fred Astaire to the creature from Black Lagoon old Hollywood is woven into this movies DNA which brings me back to Del Toro's original inspiration for telling this story to correct a cinematic mistake of sorts the movie was born in the spirit of revisionism not just of the creature story but also as it turns out of our value system from that time Strickland represents everything that was supposed to be idyllic about 1962 suburbia consumerism a traditional family dynamic deference to superiors and American exceptionalism with casual undercurrents of white / male superiority and yet despite doing all the right things of the time he's still a miserable son of a [ __ ] the movie portrays the things that we once off strived for to be unfulfilled contrast this with the outcasts the non-traditional family of the mute spinster and the lonely old closet case they live in an urban environment instead of a suburb and they're noticeably more integrated into their community the local theater owner is their landlord they frequent a local diner eliza takes the bus etc there are opposing forces at play here community vers isolationism preservation vers destruction and most importantly empathy versus fear as those are so often the two possible responses to encountering other nests in this movie proudly celebrates other nests guillermo del toro clearly has a very special ability to respond to other nnessee particularly if he can find overwhelming Beauty his words in this image the shape of water is a delightful trip inside del Toro's exceptional imagination and in some ways you begin to come around to how del toro sees things you may instinctively ask yourself how anyone could possibly ever fall in love with a fish man which is fair but it's clear del Toro sees love everywhere even in really unexpected places after all love like water has no shape but can cut through everything and take the shape of anything you need now I get it [Music]
