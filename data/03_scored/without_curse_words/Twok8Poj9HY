[Applause] the last Jedi was directed and written by Rian Johnson and it stars Daisy,0.050513577
Ridley Adam driver John boyega Oscar Isaac Carrie Fisher Mark Hamill and many many others,0.09907635
and since the force awakens we have seen the strengths of the resistance diminishing and,0.0418319
the power of the first order increasing and as rey is looking to learn the,0.06688516
ways of the Jedi from master Luke Skywalker the resistance finds itself in a race,0.11278955
against time to run from the grasp of the first order and Supreme Leader Snoke,0.16479929
the last Jedi is a film long anticipated for many and I will say this,0.06490594
this film will make the two generations of fans or maybe three very happy Rian,0.079149544
Johnson has written and directed a very ballsy risk-taking unconventional Star Wars film he directs,0.11283826
the out of this you can see a lot of the influences he has named,0.13821419
for this movie in the action sequences in the storyline in the character arcs and,0.020031596
he takes a lot of swerves just when you think you know where this movie,0.21589331
is going where certain characters are going to go he swerves you yet again hitting,0.35067016
you with surprises that will leave you gutwrench but he does this not at the,0.09337911
cost of story not at the cost of characters and how they were established not,0.042477075
at the cost of their progress of their evolution of their growth he does this,0.060731485
through having conflict and tension and dramatic way throughout the film from the very beginning,0.072995774
from the very beginning the resistance is between a rock and a hard place as,0.09189411
the first order and Snoke are hunting them down the last few remnants the remain,0.2398377
of the resistance and this tension this dramatic weight this running against time is felt,0.119267665
throughout every single storyline in this film as ray tries to learn from Luke they,0.029232062
do not have a very easy relationship and the movie takes its chances with how,0.07946886
we see and have the perception of the Jedi and the Lord and this character,0.040425297
of Luke Skywalker and just when you think that you understand the character the movie,0.09957386
yet again takes chances and changes your perception and this proves excellent writing from the,0.055493217
part of Ryan Johnson as he explores and expands the lore and our understanding of,0.03897213
it and of certain characters in this film in ways I never even imagined and,0.1345108
a way he shoots this some the way he directs there are a lot of,0.39333317
creative visuals in this film that I never thought possible a lot of his storytelling,0.13386123
is very risky particularly without spoiling with Rey and kylo Ren and now they mirror,0.11234468
each other and how they contrasts and how the force binds them together and now,0.072120026
it drifts them apart let's talk about Luke Skywalker because we did not get enough,0.18305717
of him in the last film this is Mark Hamill's best performances Luke and his,0.07544215
best performance in his career this character is going through a lot the minimal exposition,0.06713744
that was in the force awakens you got of Luke you understand that here through,0.05467443
his character development this character has gone through a lot he is still going through,0.087019086
a lot and most importantly and completely unexpected he is a completely flawed character and,0.16029261
that elevated the film for me a lot the way he teaches Rey and what,0.06858031
he has gone through as you find out in this film are very very emotionally,0.31089434
heavy they are very emotionally investing and they keep you on the edge of your,0.35490808
seat just like the tension that is felt throughout the film not only with the,0.037044164
first-order rent in the resistance but also the friction between ray and Luke and Luke,0.03562807
Skywalker does have some pants piecing moments in this film that are just nerd heaven,0.4030977
I I nearly pissed my pants in the movie theater watching some of the stuff,0.5154597
that Luke Skywalker goes through in this film and of course I will not spoil,0.15725002
anything but a certain cameo in this movie was like looking into the face of,0.15537314
God I'm saying nothing else Daisy really is impeccable as Rey once more a magnificently,0.10495622
written character not a Mary Stuart so I refer the haters out there and to,0.15200907
film me yet again takes its chances not only with her as a character but,0.11325184
the way you find out more about rate again the visual storytelling comes into this,0.065967664
the way Rey explores herself her connection to the force her past and other characters,0.07302808
as pasts are very very risk-taking and bold and they pay off beautifully John boyega,0.15057638
s Finn is funny SL once more and the film very well incorporates the funnies,0.24034138
into the sim the comedy is very well incorporated it doesn't feel like it to,0.10419617
Rails the story whatsoever it feels like something organic that comes out of the characters,0.066664785
and Finn is yet again the greatest example of that and his chemistry with Rose,0.08000611
is also spectacular Callie Murray Tran is also great in this film their chemistry is,0.04105757
excellent and both these characters really connect with each other because they are both going,0.060574576
through something very heavy emotionally speaking both Ameren is great once more coolest guy in,0.14962678
the galaxy with another cool jacket to add to this collection and he was using,0.07342205
a very surprising way for me I'm not going to spoil anything of course if,0.109601736
you like what you saw with the grey areas of the resistance in rogue one,0.31089434
you will like what you see from Poe here and let's talk about Carrie Fisher,0.080343224
it was hard watching this film I'm not going to lie there's one scene in,0.15492645
particular that we'll talk about in the spoilers review oh it was hard to breathe,0.14553523
in that moment and Leia as a character is excellent as well she's still a,0.062655896
badass she's still the general and that's one moment that I've always dreamed of seeing,0.3503262
with Leia in this film that just brought the happiest of smiles to my face,0.10515406
and we'll talk about it in the spoilers review but Carrie Fisher thank you it's,0.052634005
also her best performance in any Star Wars film and I'm very happy with this,0.0903846
Adam driver s kylo Ren continues to be yet again a conflicted complex and layered,0.11192619
villain this film deepens our understanding of kylo Ren and it swerves us with this,0.17025217
character a lot I really like the route that they took of this character it,0.034276474
was not at all that I was expecting it was not at all what I,0.08795459
envisioned for this character and in made me afraid sometimes I have to commend the,0.09077985
Ryan Johnson's courage in this film because with characters with the storyline with the way,0.05456568
he executes the storyline in this film it's ballsy this film made me afraid because,0.14550574
I wasn't liking certain directions they were taking and the film swerves me and again,0.11078529
to bring me something new I had never seen before but there's a storyline with,0.09558847
Finn and Rose that I don't have problems with but I do have problems that,0.12707272
it was so long there are incredibly important things happening in their storyline thematically speaking,0.067953214
just like with any other storyline but it does take a little bit too long,0.10227416
to get resolved and to keep going it feels like it stops like it slows,0.08127448
down unlike the rest of the film and speaking of that the film in general,0.0504808
is very slow-paced it takes its time with rays and kylo ren's training it explores,0.098597564
the mental side of it how it affects them psychologically and how they progress through,0.31440666
these struggles and it does so with a lot of other characters the action sequences,0.052150294
are incredible both in space with the Falcon flying around and the lightsaber battles the,0.074882075
lightsaber battles are probably the best in Star Wars history not gonna lie maybe not,0.07823869
better than the final duel between Luke and Vader in return but my god the,0.03904301
white shots the way we see our actors doing their stunts fighting around moving their,0.46841046
sabers the fighting styles and all it's magnificent and the cinematography is also excellent I,0.06505574
gotta congratulate the cinematography this is probably one of the most beautiful looking Star Wars,0.06183502
film there is maybe the best one maybe top to maybe top three not sure,0.053467475
but it is beautiful the last Jedi has a very clear thematic a thematic I,0.1122225
cannot tell you about otherwise it will be spoilers once you see the film it'll,0.08368232
all make sense and it is a film that imposes a lot of questions it,0.06662119
changes questions that we had before into new ones it gives us a lot of,0.0590579
answers and it makes us look forward into the future there's great exploration of the,0.03462123
lore a great swirl in the storyline and our perception of the characters and the,0.025628064
Star Wars universe it's a great addition to the franchise it keeps pushing our characters,0.03933186
and their stories forward it has great dramatic way there are moments of pure raw,0.0702212
emotion in this film moments where you will cry like that before moments where you,0.11947181
will weep like never before in moments where you will just feel pure raw anger,0.31089434
the last Jedi is by far the ballsiest Star Wars movie ever made and in,0.28207815
my money it will go down as the most controversial Star Wars movie ever made,0.079800576
the last Jedi is absolutely the stuff that dreams are made of what did you,0.085845806
