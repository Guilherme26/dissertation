different kinds of horror I would categorize this one as like a very suspenseful heart,0.066515036
like it's sort of on the line between horror and thriller because it is thrilling,0.053831317

part that was important and great there's like really nothing I didn't like about this,0.028787818
movie except for one small thing I felt like at times the dialogue wasn't written,0.06163126
as well as it could have been at times it felt a little bit cheesy,0.1655948
and I think there are two scenes in particular where there's just like a little,0.030762749
bit too much explaining happening and I know when you have a complex movie like,0.04569612
this you kind of need to have some kind of explanation at some point but,0.022785867
there are two parts where there's things being explained and it was a little bit,0.06050976
long for me and I felt like the writing for that scene was a little,0.04070724
bit cheesy and it was just like I don't know it could just be my,0.15094614
own personal preference but something was off about it and I was like I was,0.025614891
