Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett it is the sixth installment to the mission impossible franchise written and directed by the same man who wrote the last film rogue nation Christopher McQuarrie it is said to be an action-packed thrill ride by most people a local fat black YouTube critic known simply by the alias BCG is planning on reviewing this movie and giving it some type of review your mission should you choose to accept it is to watch this review in its entirety and see whether or not he does a great job of reviewing the film or completely watches it this recording will now self-destruct in five seconds good luck agent [Music] hey guys the bike critic guy and I'm here today to review the sixth installment to the mission impossible franchise mission impossible fallout so the story for Mission Impossible fallout is relatively similar to the one for rogue nation Ethan Hunt and his crew have to locate this secret evil organization this time the call of the Apostles and stop them from obtaining 2-tone iam in order to create a nuclear weapon to cause wanton destruction and while on the way they face many obstacles like mi6 agents getting in their way the CIA meddling with them once again and also being on their own and doing the impossible god I cannot believe that this is the sixth installment to the mission impossible franchise and that's been going on for this long keep in mind the first film of this franchise came out in 1996 1996 22 years ago it still stars two of the same actors from that film Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames have been in every single Mission Impossible film and Ethan Hunt has always been the main character I mean my goodness that is bonkers but the beauty of this franchise is that somehow some way they get better with age it started with Ghost Protocol then it was followed up by rogue nation which is still my favorite Mission Impossible film in the franchise and now here we are with fallout which I personally find to be a solidly made entertaining action blockbuster I noticed something very fascinating in regards to this latest installment that being this is the truest sequel to any of the Mission Impossible films what do I mean by that well basically whatever they make a new Mission Impossible film that film does not directly connect or correlate to the previous installment it's its own self-contained story but has the same characters from previous films so it's loosely connected but it doesn't continue the same narrative whereas in Fallout it is a direct continuation - rogue nation as it carries on the same narrative has many of the same characters that were introduced in rogue nation and actually gives some closure to some of the things that was presented in rogue nation not to mention that it was also written directed by the same guy and I believe that Mission Impossible fob being a direct sequel to rogue nation is both a good thing and a troubling thing as well and I'll get into that later on one thing that this franchise continues to excel at is creating gripping intense and thrilling action sequences and that is no exception here in fallout as once again the action is the best thing about this film and it just continues to build upon itself from one action scene to the next and something that I don't think I praise enough about the mission impossible franchise is it's variety in its action sequences from fist fights to gun fights to knife fights to freaking car chases there's a helicopter chase in this film and even a rope battle yeah there's actually a fight where our characters are fighting with each other with ROS I mean I gotta give them props for being so creative and varied with their action sequences they can always just do action scenes where characters are punching each other or they're just chasing each other down but sometimes they intermingle sometimes as a fist fight mixed in with a car chase scene or a car tasting mixed in with some gun fighting or just multiple things happening in the action sequences that keep it refreshing and interesting one thing that truly complements the action sequences in this film is the creative use of the camera the camera moves so phonetically that it complements these action sequences I don't think there's a single shot of the spill or the camera is not staged still and it's not that shakey cam [ __ ] either it's very clean and precise camera movements that you can see the action unfolding right in front of you this is how you feel action people can you just take a class with Christopher McQuarrie and his cinematographer so you understand how to shoot action this is how you shoot action I think it should go does saying that I thoroughly enjoyed most of the performances in this film again some were better than others and others were completely wasted but for what they had to do most of them did a excellent job particularly Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson who were the strongest performances in this film I mean Tom Cruise really delivers both in the action sequences and in some of these emotional scenes where he's talking to characters you really buy the emotion and I really feel like Tom Cruise whenever he does a Mission Impossible film he puts his best foot forward because this is his franchise this is his baby and he wants to make sure that we he makes a great product and that requires him giving a excellent performance and he does deliver once again and I must I must admire his dedication to his craft both in his performance and pulling off his stunts and age 50 something the fact that he's still doing many of these stunts is freakin impressive and there are some stunts in this film that I wonder whether or not they did this in real life or did they do it in a studio in a green-screen because I couldn't tell look the real look so natural it looked like it was naturally lidded and it made me study okay is that a green screen or does that actually being shot outside and could not put my finger on it and I've gotta give props to the special effects Department the lighting departments and the cinematography for tricking me into believing that it was real if it wasn't I also really liked the performance of the main villain from the previous film and again they kept his character intact he's still as methodical and strategic as he was in ground nation it was to delight to see them again as I still think is the best villain in the mission impossible franchise and seeing him in this film it clearly shows I truly adore how they handled Ethan and Ilsa's relationship in this film because it easily could have came off as hokey or fors or way too over-the-top to the point where you're like that's not even what their relationship was like in the previous film but no they understood these two characters to their core and understood the dynamic of their relationship and they executed it near flawlessly I think the beauty about their relationship especially in this film is that you can really sense the conflicting emotions both of them dealt with between picking their mission or choosing to protect the other their chemistry is just so on point and I've been rooting for this relationship since Rome nation because so first I remember I felt like Ethan had an equal Elsa is his equal she's not some damsel that needs to be saved she's not just some stoic badass she's a character with complex emotions a deep rich backstory and has their own motivations and can protect herself but unfortunately guys I do have a couple issues in regards to Mission Impossible fall out my biggest problem comes with its story while the story was engaging I can't help but notice after thinking about it that it does kind of feel like a retooled version of rogue nation story as it follows a lot of the same beats I mean really sit back and reflect upon the stories of the previous instalments in comparison to fallout yeah Ethan Hunt and his team who have to find locate and stop an evil terrorist organization that is bent on destroying the old world order in order to bring in a new world order which is very similar to the plans of the syndicates who were the main antagonists of the previous film not to mention that the head of the syndicate is also a vocal part of the story here in fallout and is also one of the main buildings not to mention that once and the CIA is on IMSS a war watch you guys in deadly they did the same thing in rogue nation the CIA was investigating hi I'm Evan saying oh my god what are you guys doing we're watching you guys and how many times can we disavow Ethan Hunt I mean they don't bring it up later on in the film like how many times will this guy be disavowed you know until he finally breaks and I thought that was gonna be an interesting focal point but the thing is you've established this character for the past 22 years there's no way you're going to trick the audience into believing that he's all of a sudden become evil now so it just felt like fluff to pad out the story to make it run a bit longer I mean I guess it's kind of a case of it ain't broke don't fix it as it is working form the mission impossible franchise but I think after a while and it's been more than 20 years people are gonna grow sick and tired of this same concept and they're gonna want something new and refreshing so I want you to keep that in the back of your mind people handling the mission impossible franchise you might want to mix it up in the next installment another main issue that I had with the film deals with the other antagonists played by Henry Cavill who did I spoil and a few guys oh my god I'm so sorry I mean it's not like it was so obvious from the get-go that he was gonna be the felon oh I I can't believe I ruined that for you guys I'm so sorry please as if none of us knew that he was gonna play the secret Finland in Mission Impossible follow me from the moustache so the fact that he's even in the damn film you could probably surmise what kind of character he's gonna play he's either gonna play a character replacing jeremy renner who's not in the film which i seriously doubted or be he's gonna be the surprise villain the one pulling the strings all along and if you chose B you're correct not to mention that the trailers also give away the fact that he's probably going to play an antagonist considering there are shots in the trailer where he's going toe-to-toe against Ethan Hunt so you like put two two two together okay he's probably gonna be like this big reveal supervillain oh I will say they actually do a really good job at playing of the twist with another twist kind of like a reverse twist in the sense so I like that so I guess they were kind of like yeah we know you know he's gonna be the villain win so it's pretty obvious we made it pretty clear he's gonna be the villain so they didn't twist on that whole concept and I'm like okay no huge sports film but the fact of the matter stands is that as a villain he's just not that interesting or that intimidating yeah he's Henry Cavill he's Superman he's big strong and tough but he just comes off as a must fist totally villain which is kind of suitable considering that he does have a mustache it would have been funny if they just owned it and had him twirling his mustache they're like saying the boy is going perfectly that I would have accepted that although probably wouldn't fit the realistic tone that the film was trying to go for so I understand but I just didn't care about him as a character I didn't find him all that intimidating I mean ya can handle himself in an action scene to a certain degree but other than that like there's nothing really remarkable about it he just he fades into the background and lastly I personally felt that Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin were completely wasted in this film I wish they were given more to do I wish they had more weight to them especially with Angela Bassett because it seemed like they were gonna do something interesting with her but then she ends up being like that one CIA agent that's always on the inss and when she reminds me of that one guy from the first film that is technically still a good guy but he's always antagonizing Ethan Hunt he's like I want you Ethan okay I'm coming for you you've done bad naughty naughty and I'm like can't we give Angela Bassett a more meaty role can she can she actually contribute something interesting to the plot I still really enjoyed watching Mission Impossible fall out is a great continue - rogue nation and while it's not as good as rogue nation I will say that it's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the mission impossible franchise of your battle rogue nation check this one out but as always guys I'm not the end-all be-all opinion when it comes to Mission Impossible fallout I would love to know what you guys thought of the film as well did you find an exhilarating fun and exciting to watch like my boring dull repetitive I just can't get into any more and I wish that they would kill the mission impossible franchise already and do we know what is one of your favorite
