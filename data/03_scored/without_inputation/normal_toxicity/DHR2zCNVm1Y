hi Shane here,0.07645695
you're watching Sam for God's,0.06058827
this is March check around,0.0683175
so hi guys,0.063912295
how you doing today,0.05329821
I will talk about a film that I've been wanting and waiting to see for so long,0.10584048
I can't speak to how excited,0.14061151
I was for it to finally come out of the UK because it came out in the UK about a month and a half dated in America which what is this like,0.117596775
why does America get everything early anyway I'm the 24th of July 2015 Pixar's new film inside out,0.07411274
finally came out of the UK and I went to watch it that same day,0.123592034
it was a Friday and I absolutely loved it okay,0.073437646
so if you've read anything about inside out you'd probably know that this film has been getting positive reviews after positive reviews after positive reviews hardly anyone in fact there having been a single negative review about this movie,0.1083477
and so I was very excited about seeing it because I was like whoa everybody is giving this film like amazing reviews,0.12082858
I was also a bit apprehensive because I was like surely there must be at least something wrong with a film like this movie can't be,0.13780935
so good that no one said anything bad about it,0.11789902
so I went in hoping for the best but also being open to things,0.052998595
I didn't like in the film there weren't any the film is perfect,0.061230592
if you didn't know inside-out is about a girl called Riley,0.15755802
she's like 11 or something,0.27651352
and she moves away,0.24066767
she moves from like one place to another to another state or whatever she actually moved to San Francisco which I thought was really cool because I've been San Francisco,0.08549154
I mean like San Francisco so it was cool to see that in the film but she doesn't like it fair,0.082059585
enough,0.054270513
you know she's young it's not really easy moving from one place to another because like she didn't have her friends anymore she doesn't live in her old house where she liked her room and whatnot,0.13367261
so the whole room is a bit difficult on her and yeah basically if we go inside Whitey's brain and find out how her brain is controlled doing this move,0.6051434
it's genius,0.123753935
it's the coolest thing basically the main characters in the film involve characters like joy and sadness and anger and fear and disgust,0.15658762
and the movie is just so unique so original and I honestly wasn't sure how they were gonna play out like because they is quite difficult,0.07806292
you know you go back and forth between seeing Riley in her life and then seeing the emotions in her brain but they did a great job at it like there were no moments of boredom,0.29224837
no moments of confusion,0.066383235
it was just done very very,0.037750054
well what I love most about the film is that it's just so clever and it's so deep it's so meaningful there are so many underlying themes go on and it's something that I genuinely think adults would enjoy more than children like kids can go and watch the film and like it because it's entertaining and funny,0.101941206
and there's loads of colors in the film but they probably won't understand the deeper meanings behind the film and those are the things that adults going to watch the film would notice and they'd be amazed by them like I was if you're actually in psychology even just a little bit you're gonna love this film because it just goes inside your brain,0.18483418
and it explains how brains work in a very unique way obviously that's not necessarily,0.2416836
how brains actually work,0.40313518
this is fiction,0.11144333
this is a fictional story,0.077199034
it's a fictional film,0.1852443
but it's just so clever and unique and amazing ingenious how they've come up with this system like it's a whole system in your head according to this film and all these emotions are like characters who like have to work hard every day to make sure you know your levels of emotions are like balance and everything,0.102906965
oh I just loved it so much every single character in the film and there's loads of them was great to watch there weren't any annoying people,0.16194162
there's actually one character called Bing bong and he easily could have been annoying like,0.18849911
I remember watching him at some point and thinking to myself why am I not annoyed that this character because he did some things,0.076628916
and he said some things that could have become a bit annoying but somehow they don't seem annoying like you still absolutely love Bing bong and Bing bong the character Bing bong is actually one of the reasons that I cried a lot during the film because there are some emotional sad moments I'm not going to spoil for you,0.14930917
but yeah there was one point involving Bing bong that made me literally cry like a baby it was ugly crying,0.5442212
it was the most I've cried missing him in a very long time they've got joy is probably my favorite character just because I related to her I'm somebody who normally likes even very happy and joyful and tries to see the best in every situation and tries to make everyone feel happy like I don't like sadness which is kind of what joy is about the character of joy of the feeling of joy and to like whenever something sad,0.05707128
all that happens instead of like being sad,0.108915724
I like to avoid it and like tell people to not be sad and just be happy again which in the film you learn that,0.2599675
that's not necessarily the best thing to do,0.06371018
sometimes you need sadness,0.06263424
you know in your life sometimes it's good to have a bit of a cry or just feel sad for a while oh it's just so clever thinking about it just makes me you think like whoa,0.25656056
it was amazing sadness has the character was was awesome again,0.05066717
she does quite a lot of annoying things in the film like in the beginning I was like I'm not sure if I'm gonna like her,0.3052735
but as a film went on I was like she's awesome,0.07203633
she's apps the awesome,0.14213252
she made me laugh a lot,0.278391
she was just the voice I'm acting as well as done really well in the film throughout the whole film every single character was brilliant,0.053205397
there isn't a villain in the film which is another thing I like in a lot of films especially kids films there always seems to be a villain that the protagonist of the film has to go and fight against or something,0.083827816
but inside out does not have a villain,0.1977504
they go on an adventure,0.095043324
but the adventure doesn't have to do anything with a villain,0.13580175
it's just things happen and they get to a point where they have to solve things basically I actually have some of their inside-out characters with me right now in tsumtsum form,0.10314493
so we've got joy over here,0.06906104
she looks pretty joyful,0.19297034
they've got sadness,0.09114913
she looks really sad lesser or blue and sad,0.35811877
this is fear it was actually one of the funnier characters in the film they've got anger looks pretty angry I'd say,0.15085116
and this guy's is Bing bong who I talked to you about earlier yep he's like a half elephant half something else kind of thing,0.403276
I'm not gonna give anything away,0.11603334
but yeah this is Bing bong taking off steam assumes actually if you want me to do a tsumtsum collection video at some point do you leave a comment down below and let me know anyway back to the film um honestly I was so amazed by it I loved it so much,0.11268476
I loved so much there are so many funny moments in the film so many great lines for visuals are just amazing like ah Pixar Pixar just knows how to make films like I'm probably one of the biggest Pixar fans out there as much as I love Disney with Pixar,0.056678645
it's just something else,0.063549325
I've always preferred,0.052963573
what Pixar do to what Disney does without big star,0.15381955
and they just did it with this film like,0.06999744
it's been a long time since Pixar Sports out of film that's good as inside out,0.10417369
I will say it's probably as good as Toy Story 1 or at least nearly as good as that and that's a lot coming for me because I adore Toy Story,0.097090155
I think it's one of the best films ever made be it inside out especially in terms of originality,0.13712202
and uniqueness is probably Pixar's best film I'd say it was just awesome,0.061711587
I could not find any faults with their like just go and see it please go and see it I mean you don't really need me to tell you to go and see you probably already have seen it yourself because it's doing really,0.1844183
well everyone's saying good thing about it,0.06254004
but even if you're not a fan of Disney and Pixar give this one the girl because it played with my emotions I cried I laughed it was just for me,0.11377099
I say he's probably the best film I've seen in 2015 and I've seen a lot of films this year like I don't know if you remember or not,0.055080485
but one of my name is resolutions was to watch as many films as I could this year and I have my mom's a member in the cinema the cinema,0.10530214
so I get to go free quite a lot,0.056843016
so I've seen so many different films since January of this year different kinds of films have been join us and stuff but oh my god inside that was the best one I've seen so far it's definitely gonna be an Oscar like no doubt it was just done,0.052289456
so cleverly like I came home and I could not stop thinking about it,0.17131203
and I loved every single character,0.06518092
and also I want to mention lava as well lava was the short Pixar film before inside out in case you didn't know any Pixar film that comes out in the cinema has a short piece of film that precedes it before that,0.066003755
and I've seen knows a great short Pixar films but um,0.14946114
yeah novel was a really good one not the best one not the best short to pick something I've seen but it was so good like it was so cute there's a song if you've seen the film if you've seen things I haven't seen are but you know which is on I'm talking about,0.070827805
but the whole short film is basically taught through a song,0.062978834
a ukulele song a very simple song but a very effective and cute song,0.08495661
and that goes something like I have a dream,0.060741186
I'm not going to sing it for you,0.15394568
but just look it up,0.052064028
if you want but it's such a cute song,0.06009817
and it's a very basic story which is why I don't thing is one of the best short Pixar films and because normally you know the short film short because of films have a twist and there was something just one didn't you have a twist it was quite predictable,0.07350121
but it was still so cute,0.058127537
I felt emotional,0.055575315
I felt emotional for two volcanoes guys the story is about volcanoes if you couldn't tell by the name lava and I felt sorry and sad for them,0.105197705
what is my life only pics I could do that because I think that's all I want to say I hope you enjoy this video,0.24012806
