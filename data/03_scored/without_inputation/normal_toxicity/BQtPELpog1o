how are you,0.07340407
so let's talk about Black Panther and I have a lot to say about it,0.23676237
but first this movie's made a lot of money,0.08739285
there must be some secret formula about releasing comic book movies in the month of February that just equals success and a lot of money and that let's cover the obligatory plot details T'Challa the king of Wakanda rises to the throne in his technologically advanced African nation,0.14885819
but Apollo Creed's son kill monger once his revenge and very quickly before we enter into what Conda and I start comparing this movie to The Lion King this video is brought to you by audible if you're like me and you want to get through a really good book while you're at the gym or you're driving or you're laying in your bed in the fetal position with your eyes closed at 2:00 o'clock in the morning and you're just warm and comfy and you you put the pillow right there,0.3831711

now going into this movie I was hyped because based on a few minutes that we got to see a black panther in civil war a couple years ago it made me excited for a character,0.30047312
I didn't know much about,0.06856793
and for me Black Panther is sort of like the Batman of the Marvel Universe,0.19600452
he has the coolest costume and the coolest gadgets and speaking of Black Panthers costume in this film there's a lot of upgrades and changes made to his costume where he essentially gets power upgrades,0.08043015
and now he's more indestructible than he ever was before and from a visual standpoint,0.15841143
I understand why they made some of the changes and tweaks to his costume aesthetically and from a storytelling perspective,0.15097077
I can understand why the powered up his suit,0.11188722
essentially now he's stronger than he was in previous movies because in future Marvel films you're going to have black panther standing side by side with Thor and Hulk,0.15758304
and he has to look like he can carry his own so that made sense to me now let's talk about a little animated movie called The Lion King which came out in 1994,0.26183516
and this is a true story when I was a young kid when I watched The Lion King I thought to myself if I try really hard in life one day I'll grow up to become a lion because I I don't know why I just wanted to fight hyenas,0.21681596
I thought I could do that physically you have no idea how letdown I was when I found that two years ago I couldn't,0.22401568
and this is nothing new or groundbreaking over the last couple of weeks,0.06406879
many people have compared the film black panther to The Lion King,0.016676133
and I will just say this if the writer a black panther was not heavily influenced by the story of The Lion King well then it's the biggest quit Siddhant in film history that or he's just lying because if someone told me to take the Lion King and turn it into a comic book live-action movie it would turn out just like Black Panther let me tell you something,0.31089434
my father told me Simba everything the light touches is,0.10030015
ours you must never go there that's all I got now as far as the overall look at the film black panther visually,0.1600616
it's very impressive,0.061002485
when you see the cityscapes of Wakanda and African landscapes when I was watching the film I was genuinely interested in this place Wakanda I wanted to learn more about it I wanted to see the characters interacting in a social environment and how things look and how things interact with each other,0.0677943
and what makes this place so great and when you only get three or four different locations that are all,0.042123206
the essentially the same interior shots use throughout the movie which is a lab where his sister develops the suits a little place where they grow plants and then you have the throne room and outside of that you really don't get much more and that's a little bit disappointing,0.2409856
when you see this huge amazing looking city you want to know more about it,0.07255287
and I thought the film could have established Wakanda as the character of its own throughout the movie a little bit more so than it did now as far as chadwick boseman who plays to chala aka Black Panther,0.04718919
I understand that the character at times is supposed to be stoic,0.04051447
he is a leader,0.07481815
he's very intelligent,0.18461484
but I didn't really feel like much charisma was coming from him as an actor throughout the film or not enough to really make him stand out and get audiences rooting for him throughout the movie,0.0652656
I didn't really get that,0.054698873
and with that said I think chadwick boseman is a phenomenal,0.07623142
actor the first movie I remember seeing him in was the movie 42 now real quick,0.08184743
there's just one more thing,0.046330787
I wanted to mention about Black Panther in this film and that is if you watch the film Civil War when you saw a Black Panther for the first time he was doing flips and kicking ass and he seemed real competent and confident as the character Black Panther,0.5154597
he knew what he was doing it didn't feel like his first day on the job,0.06421127
but in the film black panther black panther himself doesn't seem like he's that great of a fighter he kind of gets knocked down a lot and he almost needs to be saved multiple times by his female bodyguards who also saved the day multiple times,0.052056286
now the character in this film that has the most depth,0.05126588
and substance is the character kill monger play by Michael B Jordan and I think they cast this character perfectly because kill monger is he's a badass,0.6364068
he has a motive that makes sense and you understand it and even if you don't agree with it at least,0.09143217
you understand it the guy just wants to take what Condon's technology and give it to everyone else because he thinks they're being selfish,0.43490142
and when you watch the film you almost agree with them at times,0.05527014
but as far as Michael B Jordan as a villain in this film I thought that's what really held this movie together and gave it the depth and the substance that it needed,0.084303424
and as the old saying goes,0.05788404
a hero is only as good as his villain,0.37983385
and I think they got the villain right this time,0.19397365
especially for a Marvel movie where the villains are typically just big monster guys who want to do bad stuff for the sake of doing bad stuff,0.523342
this time around you actually got a character,0.107972205
and now I do have one other negative with the film,0.101793475
and that's some of the visuals and the fighting and action sequences throughout the movie for example there's one fight scene that takes place on a waterfall,0.052452743
we see this group of people in the background cheering on,0.13296112
and I remember watching that scene in the theater and thinking those people in the background remind me of the people in the background Street Fighter 2 yo and also throughout the movie there's an overabundance of CG that makes the character of Black Panther,0.085066274
when he's fighting look like a video game cutscene at times Black Panther is directed by Ryan Coogler who directed the film Creed you have this extended,0.18809983
one take shot with no cuts no edits and it's a phenomenal scene,0.3545373
and I was hoping for something like that in the film Black Panther because it seems like that that make movies stand out in action sequences feel so real and you remember them for years to come there isn't really one action sequence you're going to remember are you were on the edge of your seat watching their all-sufficient they're entertaining at times to watch but I really was expecting more,0.08334178
now here are my final flicking thoughts on the film black panther overall,0.119683735
this is a fun comic book movie that is entertaining at times,0.09962909
and the best thing about this movie is,0.0730887
it's a comic book movie that has a moral message to tell people and it's you should help people just because you have something doesn't mean you should keep it for yourself,0.11400005
give it to people help them out,0.08209284
and that's a good message that's positive two thumbs up for that,0.05185304
but I would be lying if I said this film didn't have some pacing issues and it could have been better than it was especially with the action,0.104279384
and the way that it was filmed,0.064206325
I really expected a little bit more out of this movie just based on the character and how awesome you could make a black panther film just take the character of Black,0.10952107
Panther put him in this situation show his movesets and his skills and how he can do flips and just take those calls,0.13839957
and just ah overall,0.059192687
this is a competent movie I think it's a good first solo movie for Black Panther is it as great as it could have been probably not,0.1542027
and I will just say this 10 years ago who would have ever thought we would be seeing a solo Black Panther film like it's crazy,0.4367443
we live in great times right now I'm going to give the film Black Panther,0.07702939
Oh a b-minus go check the movie out it's a good time it's entertaining,0.16097453
and it's a solid Marvel movie with a great villain,0.24815786
that doesn't happen very often in Marvel movies so that's my take on the movie black panther,0.29752243
