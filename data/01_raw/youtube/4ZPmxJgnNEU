hey this is our vici with your entertainment ticket at WWE ticket dot-com your entertainment ticket well the film I'm gonna talk about right now is called the shape of water no I'm not talking about an ice cube I'm talking about a film by director Camaro they'll tour oh I love his vision and I love the way he shoots television and film well let me tell you about this story this story's two main character is about Eliza she's a mute and she works in some place in Baltimore look like a government control or might be a government control company what she mops and she also does that that worked with her great friend who's played by Octavia Spencer and her friend is named Zelda well they look out for each other you know they mop the floors clean up and things like that now the other main character in this is a monster actually it's monster looks like something from the Black Lagoon if you remember that movie well I do maybe you won't and this is said in the 1960s you know at the height of the Cold War and because of that time you know 1960s everybody's afraid of everything and they treat everything very nasty you know there's you know bigotry and things like that in fact the main nemesis for this monster is Richard Strickland play by Michael Shannon man this is a great role for him and he's a guy he lives in the suburbs split-level house with his wife and two kids he drives a Cadillac car now Calais car and you know he also the sexual harassment at the workplace but remember 1960s who's gonna tale but now he Liza she gets to see the monster be she hears the screams and everything how they Trina's monsters sometimes stricken comes out with blood on him from punishing this monster so she gains the monsters trust she feeds him teaches him sign language plays music form and things like that and they fall in love now del Toro you know it looks like he took many of the old monster movies some of their stories and put this together and to you the movie Gore you might seem familiar with this story and I said ok alright ok I've seen something like that before but he does bring a freshness to this monster story and also he creates splendor with the color of the film and also with the characters and the acting and one thing about the characters you will sit there and say go go don't get caught in other words you were root for all the characters you even root for Strickland and also you will root for Eliza and Zelda one thing about this film is that it shows the humanity of man how when there's something different we don't understand it and then some group gets gets his hand on it how they treat it they don't treat it in a very good way and it's been throughout history so I think del Toro is really trying to show us us humans how we are how we react when there's something different you know and I really know a lot about that well the shape of water I'm gonna give this 3 and 1/2 palm trees because this is a very exciting film entertaining and I really enjoyed the characters in this film they were fun to watch and it felt like you were there watching them you know standing next to them watching everything's going on and that's why I really like the shape of water three and a half palms for me al McGee here your entertainment ticket at WWE ticket dot-com thank you for watching I really appreciate it [Music] why [Music]
