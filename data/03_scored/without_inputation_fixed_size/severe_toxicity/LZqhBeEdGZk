now i mentioned earlier this ends the file film 2 stars Hugh Jackman as the,0.02593684
titular and iconic character Logan aka Wolverine it's also the final appearance of passive Stewart,0.045717407
as Professor Xavier as he too stated that he's going to be retiring from the,0.0346421
role after this film so Logan is basically an end of an arrow type film,0.04762848
as we have seen these two portrayed these characters for close to 20 years and,0.015341796
now it's all come to an end so there was no way that I was,0.029095799
missing out on seeing Logan I grew up with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and I,0.052441083
will be there for his last film and I was super excited the trailers are,0.026057905
freaking awesome it's freakin rated R which got me really excited so we could see,0.3269308
some really intense who are some a gritty action from Wolverine the type of action,0.029727722
we've always wanted to see so I could not wait to see Logan and after,0.015384368
watching the film what did I think about it well let's get into it shall,0.0790318
we first thing worth mentioning about Logan was its action this is without a doubt,0.033766054
the most gruesome action I have ever seen in a Wolverine film and it's exactly,0.097690865
the kind of action we all have been waiting to see in a Wolverine film,0.08545947
you guys remember that one spectacular action sequence in Xmen apocalypse we're Wolverine is mowing,0.021995628
down guys left to right we'll take that one scene from x-men apocalypse and extend,0.08322445
it by two hours that's the sort of high-octane action you get to witness in,0.023000054
Logan it's exhilarating bloody and also fun to watch with so many awesome and gratifying,0.34932905
kills I mean you got head piercings limbs flying everywhere blood spewing all over the,0.666103
place it's just over-the-top action goodness the acting is tremendous especially Hugh Jackman as Logan,0.04390345
aka Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier no surprise there this was honestly the,0.060912862
most challenging and riveting performance I've seen Hugh Jackman give as the character Logan /,0.012563324
Wolverine and he has to portray a much older weaker and vulnerable Logan while still,0.040348046
maintaining the reluctant hero persona as well as a sinister ferocity and in my opinion,0.1345254
he pulled it off perfectly and I expect no less it was a near-perfect swan,0.074157335
song for a character that has been his for 17 years and I will miss,0.01833379
him dearly after this film Patrick Stewart's also try something new with his portrayal of,0.05824348
Charles Xavier a more new approach to the character it says of the smart reasonable,0.020580117
and collected professor figure that we have known in love for many years TC now,0.013623626
mentally unstable and crass it was quite jarring to see to say the least I,0.22325975
mean the once great Professor X brought down to a doddering old fool my heart,0.36051765
did break but it made for one of the most memorable and emotional heart-wrenching performances,0.028996686
in the entire film that is just neck-and-neck with Hugh Jackman's performance and a little,0.05271913
girl that plays Laura was pretty good too a feisty little one she is you,0.07035647
do not want to get on her bad side ever and it to go without,0.047789454
saying that the actors as well as the characters that they play has convincing and,0.015802767
dynamic chemistry with Logan and Charles being the strongest no surprise there I mean these,0.02803882
two have been in almost every single x-men film together the story here is solid,0.024200046
and engaging for the most part many high points many low points I enjoyed the,0.044814087
journey aspects of the story there's a lot of great emotional things a lot of,0.006578666
kick-ass action scenes it's a well told well structured and enthralling story and it had,0.5021203
a very Western vibe to it throughout the entire film which makes sense given what,0.012867978
type of story is and also a very very very fitting ending for a story,0.03509176
like this and lastly all the technical aspects ranging from cinematography visual effects sounds and,0.020280119
all that jazz were well done so it seems as though Logan was the perfect,0.043575514
send-off for Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine character now we can ride triumphantly to the,0.074515864
sunset right right right well actually I do have a couple issues with the film,0.039634302
Logan and I feel like many of you have your Wolverine claws shooting out of,0.29263908
your fists like what how could you find anything wrong this movie this movie's an,0.23453893
edge of masterpiece Tony when you're talking about your nonsubscribers just like this video all,0.11177746
you're a terrible person calm down listen to what I have to say and remember,0.3622966
that overall I love this film it's a really really really enjoyable film but it,0.065515265
is not without its flaws my biggest problem with this film was that there was,0.023993174
way too much downside that ruins the overall flow of the pacing now look I,0.0809289
completely understand that these downside moments are meant to give the audience some time with,0.020618033
the characters as well as a break from the action scenes but some of these,0.025576977
Delta moments stretch on for far too long like the first act with Logan Charles,0.010410789
in this one mutant named Caliban living together in an abandoned smelting plant others just,0.061077826
don't really add much to the characters that they really explore or develop these characters,0.029667191
in these outside moments like a hotel scene with Charles Logan and Laura and then,0.028202455
others were completely ineffectual and superfluous to the entire story like that entire segment were,0.067141645
Logan Charles and Laura spend the night at farming families house what was the point,0.016184583
of having that effect that entire scene felt eerily similar to the scene and x-men,0.046342015
origins Wolverine hoovering say that mom potheads farming house and they end up buying the,0.12245166
dust a multitude of these scenes could have easily been trimmed or completely removed they,0.05960511
didn't need to be in the film the main antagonists work really that memorable nor,0.01753025
were they all that threatening not to mention that they're just the same recycled evil,0.1025487
corporation experimenting on mutants that we have seen of by the time and other x-men,0.060886256
/ wolverine films but I will give some credit to that one villain who constantly,0.07043097
wore shades in the film and had that metal hand he has a flair of,0.0034749194
coolness to look that made him pretty interesting but as the film went on he,0.026762333
was just relegated to mere henchman status boom and the last major problem I found,0.048809845
with Logan was I wish they gave us more bonding moments between Logan and Laura,0.015555319
and sure the film does give us a handful that were serviceable but not in,0.01853002
the truly drive home that they built a strong deep and powerful connection throughout the,0.011514994
entire film it was lacking to say the least now the next few points are,0.043320086
just mere nitpicks they're not cons against the film they don't detract from the film,0.06491261
but they did personally irritate me throughout one of the biggest ones is I wanted,0.120353006
more explanation as to what happened to the other x-men now it's heavily implied that,0.022867683
Charles had something to do with it but never explicitly told to us and I,0.018515388
personally believe that at this point it would be nice to kind of get an,0.028030174
explicit explanation as to what happened to all of our favorite x-men where are they,0.028317533
are they still around it they could have explained a little bit more of that,0.026478965
another significant and this is risk coming for me was the constant cussing throughout the,0.12276895
film now far be it for me to complain that a film has too much,0.05104819
cussing in it I mean I cuss way more than I should in my own,0.35547316
videos and look I don't have a problem with excessive cursing in a film in,0.27603543
fact I prefer it and thoroughly enjoy it as long as it comes off natural,0.0885998
the problem here in Logan is that many of these scenes are laced with profanity,0.04291632
come off as super force like they just have to throw in a and a,0.2139164
kid here because they got an R rating which I'm grateful for I'm thankful that,0.04550255
you finally gave us a or rated Wolverine film as they gave us some of,0.040383965
the best action we've ever seen a Wolverine film but just because you're all rated,0.02662597
doesn't mean that you have to cut every three to five seconds I mean as,0.046973273
long as you do it now and again that's perfectly fine in fact it would,0.028835045
be more effective also hearing Patrick Stewart's version of Charles Xavier cursing so much was,0.19077002
just so weird and unsettling now Logan I understand as he's always been a character,0.03589597
that's known to fly off the hinges you know go off the handle but with,0.0359126
Xavier I always saw him as a man of intelligence integrity and elegance who wouldn't,0.19086313
stoop to using such a vulgar and petty speech so to hear him cursing so,0.45774466
much in this film I didn't know how to feel I was kind of taken,0.054408032
aback like oh not not not wrong Xavier does all the characters that should never,0.022068132
cut in my presence it's Charles Xavier I don't like seeing Charles cussing so much,0.38674283
and look I understand that it fits the type of character that he is in,0.025678085
this film as he is losing his mind he is senile so of course he's,0.21564522
more prone to these petty outbursts but that doesn't mean it changes how I feel,0.042926297
about it I still can't see Charles Xavier cursing but overall guys despite a few,0.23273402
problems I still found Logan to be a super film that I thoroughly enjoyed watching,0.041614555
from beginning to end it is my second favorite Wolverine film after the Wolverine and,0.029000012
I thought it was an excellent send-off to an iconic character and an iconic role,0.101588845
portrayed by Hugh Jackman and he will sorely be missed but I am very thankful,0.031419285
that for his last film as Wolverine he made it one hell of a film,0.105260655
that I highly recommend that you all go see in fact I'll even need to,0.02885234
tell you guys to go see it because you already have seen it or bored,0.03809041
to see it regardless of what I think but as always guys I'm not the,0.021927115
end-all be-all appear when it comes to Logan I would love to know what you,0.094311066
guys saw about the show as well did you absolutely adore it is it your,0.056769434
favorite Wolverine film it's the best superhero film you've ever seen we're finally boring and,0.089622855
slow and you really couldn't get into it and let me know what is the,0.050521363
