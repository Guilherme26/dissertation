Oh could I ask you to love Rebecca step whenever you touched me I knew,0.23973738
hi guys thank you for joining me again um we are talking about Rebecca today,0.11558121
from 1940 so normally on this channel I share things with you that I am,0.1341817
watching for the first time because there's so many there's just so many classic films,0.14927714
and I've seen quite a lot of them but there's always ones I haven't seen,0.06488546
and I always like to expand my viewing you know but this time I'm sharing,0.083102904
Rebecca with you because a friend of mine said she's like why don't you talk,0.2632404
about Rebecca and I was like the only reason I I haven't is just because,0.088534825
normally I share things I haven't watched and Rebecca is one of my favorite classic,0.07600708
films and yeah I guess I should share some of those with you guys as,0.14521714
well right so this is a Hitchcock film was actually Hitchcock's sort of first Hollywood,0.11417193
film and it was the only Hitchcock film to ever win an Oscar so that,0.10668795
makes it a little bit special in itself it is a psychological thriller and it,0.1979307
is based on the book called Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier Hitchcock adapted other of,0.075207256
her books some of some others of her books as well if you've never read,0.31089434
a Daphne du Maurier book highly recommend it she's such a good writer she creates,0.15977076
atmosphere and her books are kind of not really supernatural sometimes there's an element like,0.11794786
a ghostly sort of element or mood like a gothic mood Rebecca definitely has kind,0.08009381
of a gothic vibe but um she just has this way of kind of making,0.13351738
this atmosphere and this creeping strangeness and mystery and you just want to know what's,0.22554325
really going on and who did what and what's really happening so if you've not,0.0790172
read one of her books before I recommend Rebecca hustling because it's a bit of,0.16318153
a favorite of mine this film Rebecca is actually very similar to the book which,0.06510923
is nice I think Hollywood films of this era or maybe just films in general,0.07967145
sometimes they stick to the book and sometimes they really don't and you know either,0.09196395
can be good without apt ations but I think in this case sticking sticking to,0.08166946
this plot was a good thing so stars Joan Fontaine and she actually isn't named,0.12177539
so we will call her mrs. to winter if you don't know Joan Fontaine I,0.22363885
do talk about her in some other movies they talked about she was in suspicion,0.10548084
which is another Hitchcock one as well Laurence Olivier plays Maxim Laurence Olivier is a,0.097722374
was a really Laurence Olivier it was an institution basically so he's known for his,0.0629568
version of Hamlet so Joan Fontaine plays I think she's about 23 24 she's very,0.14297344
young and she gets she goes to Monte Carlo working as a companion so she's,0.08111051
somebody who's quite naive has been quite sheltered and she's trying to work for a,0.36449957
living in a respectable way so she's very socially naive and young and she gets,0.42993954
swept off her feet by Maxim de Winter who played by Laurence Olivier as I,0.37860137
said he's dashing handsome sort of mysterious he has this past where his wife died,0.35351598
tragically and everyone talks about how he never got over it and his wife Rebecca,0.24225163
is like supposed to be just the most beautiful woman and but they fall for,0.1756984
each other and his nicer kind of side comes out and she agrees to marry,0.0858328
him and it's all very cute but then they get home to his house called,0.11258991
Mandalay which is like a huge mansion that's been in his family for generations and,0.07841711
it's it's such a core part of the film and it's also part of his,0.062210057
identity because it's his ancestral home and it means just means so much to him,0.09545236
but you get the impression that Rebecca's just everywhere in this house so the new,0.06487371
mrs. Dewinter feels like he can't forget his ex-wife and she sort of almost wants,0.1197656
the film but not physically and this is kind of exacerbated by mrs. Danvers who,0.10489804
is the housekeeper but she was personal maid to to Rebecca she's played by Judith,0.10486849
Anderson so 10 commandments Laura she has such a great face for this role because,0.067134276
she sort of she has like a severe kind of nose and she's not plain,0.53490317
but she's not um she's sort of not sparkling or lively and you can kind,0.28176665
of see why she would be she's a mean spirited person and you can see,0.6394754
why she would have been drawn to Rebecca as somebody kind of who was everything,0.23908244
she couldn't be you know like wealthy beautiful admired all of these things so mrs,0.30266002
danvers is pretty horrible to the new mrs. Dewinter she kind of she's never directly,0.46937296
rude but she just does little things like Oh Rebecca would have done it this,0.31258577
way Rebecca would have done it that way or the previous mrs. de winter always,0.07373309
did this and the jerem Fontaine's garde to basically just can't kind of catch a,0.09221385
break and it starts to make her more and more sort of retreating into her,0.14722984
shell and she can't quite reach out to maxim he just has his own personal,0.23706666
demons and doesn't really understand the position that she's in because he's never been in,0.37911898
that position himself so that's kind of the core thing is Rebekah haunting them but,0.1124866
it sort of comes to light that there's more to Rebecca's death than kind of,0.15116774
meets the eye so I don't want to tell you too much about that but,0.11079423
that's kind of a cool thing I absolutely love Durham Fontaine in this movie she's,0.18083045
kind of she's got an inner toughness but she's just so unsure about herself socially,0.1884627
because she's so young she doesn't come from money she's never had to you know,0.21489777
run a household and that's the kind of thing that people are raised to do,0.09801924
and she also she's very pretty but she's not like a bombshell or anything you,0.4941072
know she's not used to people looking to her for answers and that kind of,0.16218498
thing so she doesn't know how to take control of a situation and that's handled,0.15980774
really well in this film because could just easily be like a OneNote character but,0.045348857
in de Moraes book you really understand how she's looking for guidance and people are,0.119774066
kind of taking advantage of that I'm giving her incorrect information and that kind of,0.16766518
thing so she's kind of she's beautiful her character is very dramatic but she also,0.25554177
has this vulnerability that's just really nicely done so yeah I think she's so good,0.14995025
in this film and also Laurence Olivier's maxim is really great because he's very commanding,0.14617452
he's very dashing but he has that British reserve that can come across as coldness,0.1916545
and it also kind of hides a temper and a kind of passionate nature as,0.074852705
well she's kind of his perfect romantic but maybe kind of doc character um so,0.11542896
Hitchcock when he made films he would always storyboard a lot so that's like almost,0.12613636
like drawing the book is a cartoon it was a comic strip beforehand so he,0.27224302
would really only shoot what he wanted and they kind of call that style of,0.6676789
editing in camera it's where you you don't take any extra footage for sort of,0.12691063
just in case you just shoot you know exactly what you want so you just,0.7899626
shoot that and it has kind of made him very popular I think because it,0.5876557
meant he was always sort of on-time and on-budget and organized and he didn't mess,0.090102464
around which Studios really appreciate because it keeps things keep things moving and they're not,0.09582789
wasting money but it also means that you can't do any sort of edits because,0.15687747
there's no extra footage to kind of throw something else in there so it's a,0.17486587
kind of way for the director to kind of keep control Selznick who had been,0.10145074
walking on gone with the wind around this time and as a producer he definitely,0.08688434
had more of a hand in this film than Hitchcock would normally have allowed but,0.14961195
he was new to Hollywood I think cell isn't kind of felt like you know,0.19322096
he was proud of this film whereas I do think it's it is Hitchcock's baby,0.17439175
but no offense to Selznick but it definitely feels like a Hitchcock film but he,0.10301596
did actually order some reshoots and things like that which is quite unusual for hqo,0.10306052
film so I used to watch this film with my dad growing up this is,0.07961791
one of my dad's favorite films as well she's kind of maybe why I have,0.14553113
a bit of a soft spot for it but I love movies that have some,0.07010997
kind of a mention in them I don't know what it is but haunted house,0.10859848
movies I love anything where there's like a big kind of house I just love,0.13154054
it I dunno I'm not even a big house it's just an interesting house I'll,0.12985477
go for that but if you throw in like a mystery or anything like that,0.27394527
you know I'm there so this film kind of has that gothic tone because it,0.15934913
is that like sort of foreign aid sort of a horror film it's thriller but,0.15106222
it has this kind of mansion a woman in distress kind of Rebecca almost a,0.18865974
ghost you never see her or anything like that she's not moving furniture or anything,0.26329154
but even though she's dead it still feels like she's a character in this film,0.29498655
so yeah that's kind of what I love about this I mean that obviously the,0.15422416
performance is it's amazing how well they capture the tone and the style and the,0.060292218
character of the book like no one is trying to make themselves sort of different,0.09007637
or you know pulling focus it's all about stabbing the story and I just think,0.28278726
it works really well does this may be my favorite Hitchcock film um so yeah,0.08381856
I also think Rebecca as a character is so interesting because she's not actually in,0.14607176
the film there's no one plays her she's not here but she's talked about and,0.1375627
she's not a shrinking violet she's very dark and manipulative and you kind of piece,0.5229247
her together from what you know about her like she starts off as being this,0.18480381
romantic tragic figure that Maxim just can't get over but she's really not an innocent,0.1149093
victim in any way she's so unusual as a car as a female character in,0.2899698
in a movie because women don't often didn't often get these kind of really interesting,0.40893015
complex characters so I think she's kind of I understand she's really great like and,0.10148283
also ever the you know the visuals of this film are so good to the,0.08254861
restrained performance of mrs. Danvers and the costuming where Joan Fontaine is is very pretty,0.086611375
but she sort of got this slightly conventional unassuming way of dressing it's just I,0.22985712
didn't really like the incredibly high ceilings in this house and then moving Cotton's and,0.05254612
the the bedroom where Rebecca's things are never touched and mrs danvers has this sort,0.117057845
of obsessive like everything must remain the same kind of thing it's very atmospheric so,0.14636019
yeah I think and this is Danvers characters almost hypnotic I think probably what is,0.034064285
so great about this or what is handled so well is that you know any,0.08511597
of this could have just sort of fallen into melodrama very easily but it's the,0.085775286
restraint everybody's sort of restrained and nothing's ever caught too nish nobody ever gets hysterical,0.31089434
it's sort of everyone's kind of got this quiet but Channing emotion it's really great,0.11780357
so yeah this is an amazing debut film for Hitchcock in Hollywood obviously he'd done,0.11965366
quite a few things in the UK but this is an incredible entree into the,0.08567978
kind of studio system and all that kind of thing so yeah I mean this,0.07249483
is one of my all-time favorite films so I kind of I can't really recommend,0.08589345
it highly enough and I also think having seen it like a few times over,0.07924019
the years I think it means different things to me at different times I think,0.061937127
as a child I felt I didn't really care about Laurence Olivier I think I,0.09391067
really related to the new mrs. Dewinter kind of having the stuff and sort of,0.056981064
push her around and then you know now as an adult I kind of think,0.447004
there's a transition period in all of our lives where we go from being other,0.12401972
people having direction to us having direction of our own lives and have seemed to,0.14777264
take control of situations or even move from being from being one thing to being,0.056569625
like manager of other people or even just that sense of you have an idea,0.1452884
a dream of how things are gonna be and sometimes the reality is not fitting,0.08634375
in we don't always fit in and as people often romanticize other people and I,0.1377866
think Rebecca is somebody who's romanticized by the people around her and yet she's not,0.19264118
that nice so there's a lot of kind of coming-of-age sort of concepts in here,0.138755
it's not a coming-of-age film in any way but I think it sort of says,0.18253547
a lot about relationships and how people see them from the outside and how we,0.044998914
present ourselves and maybe even a loss of innocence but house so yeah so that's,0.06911387
Rebecca it's from 1940 it's black-and-white film I cannot recommend it I laid off absolutely,0.24903873
