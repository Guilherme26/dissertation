hello I haven't really done this in a while and I thought I wanted I,0.077380076
would want to kind of start easy into this whole thing so I recently watched,0.11777344
this movie called eighth grade which I'm sure everyone has heard of something green many,0.12767488
people have heard of it although it may not be like a popular movie per,0.05780595
se but I saw it recently in quite late to the party and I thought,0.045813277
it was very fascinating because of how well fails were unfamiliar eighth grade is about,0.15049799
a girl who is in eighth grade and in the 2010s and it really encapsulate,0.15882815
so the era of it and it's very fascinating because if well getting into it,0.07939095
more later but there's this idea in which technology is just so quickly and rapidly,0.056885216
developing and changing every few years that again watching this movie and maybe two years,0.090394326
from now maybe two years from my you watch this movie again it will appeal,0.09436104
to something be quite adequate because perhaps if the specific reference is a certain things,0.043124624
in social media specific trends the fact that this film opens and ends with a,0.07120053
YouTube recording a recording of a YouTube video and that YouTube is it really is,0.060115136
a big part of the lives of many younger people and even just more more,0.08582479
people in general like you know this idea that this is a new platform that,0.07901419
has really superseded the media landscape those are what one would choose is doing an,0.07943148
any given point is to kind of you know go on their phone or whatever,0.09566474
and watch some videos online and that really is a big part of how this,0.105054736
generation this new crop of human beings coming into this world has to deal with,0.40329844
unfortunately or fortunately you know it there many things that go in and out of,0.14705436
that but there's what what struck me most about it I mean you know this,0.1192288
movie's fine it's funny and sweet and all that but what struck me most about,0.13410614
the movie maybe really think because there's a scene in the movie where the young,0.122806676
and I forgot her name but the actors Elsie Fisher she was about to hang,0.2310675
out with this new friend she made it was an older high school student and,0.08754537
they go to this mall of sores and they are having some kind of you,0.4033894
know they they they have dinner or something and this older boy makes a suggestion,0.111405954
it makes no suggestion but he makes a he kind of asks questions of this,0.09529489
young a the grader girl in which he seems to delineate that there seems to,0.46313357
be a generation a generational difference between a pair of friends and the young girl,0.10464219
and it's a four-year age difference but for some reason it feels generational because a,0.07386511
lot of the things that they felt they grew up on and whether it is,0.035431
ideals or whatever a lot of the things they grew up on and she did,0.10611796
not grow up on and things that she grew up on we're not not exist,0.17617817
of and they were kind of coming of age and the example of use is,0.037075154
like when did you get your first we need use snapchat and she says fifth,0.16905296
grade and for them that they so if they think well that's kind of crazy,0.49346644
that you were in fifth grade when the snapchat came out because it definitely would,0.25118217
have change how you perceive the world or she did say something about how you,0.10290573
know probably were sending dick pics in fifth grade with each other you know because,0.8445405
I guess snapchat is used in a very sexual manner or some teenagers so it,0.5494096
seems that that the fact that it was a popular must have influenced how she,0.059209626
and others people her age develop and think about the world in a way that,0.15216379
even distinguishes them generationally even though it's just four years when you think about like,0.077988245
stuff like the baby boomers and gen-x and you know these how people are mentally,0.41259518
distinguished generations were in these like 20 30 year block periods of time when you,0.124652095
would have been born and now on a practical level on a relational level it,0.17955148
seems that there are generational differences between someone who is saying my age and someone,0.18662222
who is four years younger than me and four years younger than them because of,0.0921842
how big how it really it seems to that a lot of how we interact,0.09084893
with the world does rapidly is rapidly changing and in developing and I think it's,0.08207799
it's interesting because I'm not sure how do how it would play for someone who's,0.09984696
older right or someone who's older than me for example who didn't have to do,0.15547565
didn't really have to kind of go through the specifics of the specificities of the,0.05131914
social media a revolution of sorts it does feel for me for example that when,0.07905451
I imagine my growing up and the degree to which I had social media I,0.052965753
do think that one social media became such a popular thing it did influence our,0.05446017
relied in such a big way that it must it does feel like there must,0.06954858
be some kind of disconnect but it's hard to tell how that will kind of,0.06845865
manifest in the future whether or not that not that it actually you know it,0.06283831
changes anything particular the fact that according up within the internet for example I think,0.07258325
probably you know me gives me a different experience of obviously because me different experience,0.08773961
but I grew up with a very strong inclination towards trying to read things online,0.056785353
and Masri di love thing and Wikipedia and being able to you know read about,0.11229407
movies or see movies or all these things I would have been impossible before you,0.11098284
know and the thing with social media with specifically with younger people is that it,0.07121227
agree as it's kind of an obvious thing I don't even feel like it's very,0.116398685
interesting for me to talk about it but again it's this idea where you kind,0.112150416
of have to create this online identity of source so that seems to be just,0.06662815
as important perhaps as your social real life I don't say real life but like,0.17439961
your physical identity and it's you have to kind of manipulate how you are perceived,0.46142834
in those different kind of Stratton's of you know it's it's a whole thing that,0.06581632
it's a whole issue that some people feel like they need to deal with and,0.07078352
it's a very common right now obviously but it does definitely does seem like something,0.07493765
that would be stressful if one had to kind of go into that from a,0.09087214
very young age because again when I think about my growing up when I was,0.06885223
around an eighth grade or whatever the degree to which I had social media was,0.08731472
um we had messaging apps which is I was on Yahoo Messenger and that was,0.097714916
the extent of it I mean there was no real sense of identity to that,0.07996509
degree were except for the fact that you would have the ability to be true,0.15165934
as a profile picture and maybe write a little bit like a status message I,0.0934028
think which is interesting because it doesn't really rhyme come up in the future social,0.060838304
media platforms but where you have like a persistent set of words or things that,0.111897856
you know that would always be seen whenever one that he tries to contact you,0.056048658
like a Fraser some people put links and music or whatever it was but that,0.0675914
was only that was the extent of it we didn't have to think about the,0.047618467
say the mystification of the daily life through snapchat stories or Instagram stories or the,0.055241235
idea that one has to constantly a massive following or at least not the study,0.07112879
that one has to a massive following but that one's so-called following has some kind,0.07397023
of pertinence to their social status and their even in the school setting because I,0.11321225
definitely have seen this manifest in some places I know I've I've involuntary dad for,0.07890827
example in different schools or even just in my own school and saying oh when,0.05506075
I was about to leave high school it was just a very big thing it,0.11240142
is a very big thing that is being a part of the lives of those,0.07723575
who are growing up and I'm very curious to see how it kind of well,0.054204248
if it even does influence how when things about the world and process things and,0.089669965
the amount of maybe perhaps personal stress and how we how the creation of the,0.06794402
the separate identity the online identity how that kind of evolved in manifestos you went,0.12107485
as one gets older as well and comes out to say the face of adolescence,0.16084313
which you know is a long period but again it's it's so eighth grade I,0.089070015
mean I don't guess I don't read it didn't even talk about the movie that,0.064843565
much I liked it you know it's fine but I was very fascinated about that,0.05689882
idea right of the idea of the the shortening of the supposedly but you can,0.08774721
argue about what a generational gap even means and maybe you can say well it,0.110717185
doesn't even matter it's not a real generational gap but the fact that in practice,0.09227738
is felt is something worth probably considering and I'm wondering how as I kind of,0.059198033
progresses into the future so you know that's what I thought about some of the,0.07785645
things I went on in that movie I've I know there are many things I,0.061963487
can talk about over the next few however long I'm going to be doing these,0.07316737
but yeah I was gone because I was a backpacking in Japan for a few,0.12205881
for two and a half months I was backpacking it made it difficult to kind,0.04754981
of and I didn't really want to make videos I just wanted to kind of,0.06326041
experience things in the moment and those in that kind of period and it was,0.063508995
a lot of things can go on I can talk about some of those stuff,0.06049218
next time but yeah this is what I think honey watch the movie and especially,0.078473315
I think is very useful to watch the movie if you are someone who doesn't,0.121297926
understand doesn't understand the younger generation because the movie does kind of get a lot,0.08328775
of or it seems to you know accurately depict a lot of the issues that,0.051062677
seems to be persistent in say people who are my age people who are a,0.12673487
few years younger than me it is quite accurate I think so you know that's,0.074554116
interesting to look at if you are not very young if you don't quite understand,0.24916165
what it's like or you want to kind of know a little peek into the,0.10033615
the gen Z life then you can check out the movie I think you'll be,0.15207694
