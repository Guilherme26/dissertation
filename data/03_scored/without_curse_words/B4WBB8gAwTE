because it's just a movie first of all what I like let's talk about Luke,0.09560442
Skywalker Mark Hamill zero lines in the last movie this is kind of a long,0.11257104
time coming I thought he was great in this movie he's clearly a damaged man,0.43293908
the weight of the world which is funny because it's not just one world and,0.079489335
star wars so I guess it would be the way to the galaxy is on,0.14896978
his shoulders and you really feel it he's kind of an Old Crow much and,0.15578413
he's kind of a dick it's kind of sarcastic but I thought he was fantastic,0.94992846
in fact my favorite of the arcs in this movie is race time on the,0.073493935
island with Luke it was great is as gruff and grumpy as Luke was he,0.27771485
didn't cease to be Luke it could have been Mark Hamill just being an old,0.1450423
grumpy guy and for a second I thought he was so then something happens he,0.46594483
has some dialogue we're like oh no you're still Luke Skywalker you've just kind of,0.15234521
been raked through a river of but Luke is still there that's important also Poe,0.05864383
Dameron has a lot more to do I'm glad Poe Dameron had a lot more,0.06609103
to do of our new heroes he's the one we saw the least in the,0.06995755
last movie I'm glad we saw a bit more of him in this movie we,0.1056062
saw a lot more of him actually there were a couple things that moved it,0.087357506
straight of reminded me of Battlestar Galactica's like Rian Johnson was like oh I love,0.10165644
Battlestar Galactica I'm gonna put that in a Star Wars movie that sounds awesome right,0.10818022
because they weren't they were cool and I will say this about the movie when,0.085737765
a character is in danger you do feel that danger I love that how many,0.10931587
movies out there the characters in peril you're like yeah whatever I know they're fine,0.077086225
there's something about the craftsmanship in this one Rian Johnson was like this is how,0.056120694
you should make a movie like there's that feeling of security is gone so few,0.112595856
times does it happen in a film which the movie has a lot of humor,0.0816027
in it too there's no thing quite a few times the last time the human,0.18855146
didn't land as much as they probably wanted it to point is if that JJ,0.052394312
Abrams humor irritated you in episode 7 it's still in episode 8 so probably irritate,0.1865566
and visually speaking Ryan Johnson is on another level of directors less lens flares I,0.11505168
could say that the action sequences are great just space battles look fantastic the ground,0.062381804
battles look fantastic the movie just looks beautiful there is one scene in this movie,0.12869897
in particular that it's just it's such an orgasmically gorgeous moment it happens and it's,0.51974046
there and you're watching it you're like I want that poster or screensaver or wallpaper,0.102965
on the phone another scene I'm talking about the movie will go on you'll be,0.07555578
like is that that and then it'll happen a bit like that's exactly what he's,0.114526875
talking about the Finan what's her name rose i think her name's rose finn and,0.10256942
rose that arc is the one room like and it just didn't really work for,0.05619366
me this is actually it's the arc i can talk about that's not a spoiler,0.05464282
and the fact that it's not a spoiler the fact that i feel like i,0.06693447
can talk about their arc but i don't feel like i can talk about a,0.058588874
lot of the other arc shows how just insignificant their arc is they go to,0.17478225
a dump planet that bores me and just when they're on their mission rest assured,0.40314963
you can leave the theater to take a piss you're welcome internet i mean it,0.4263167
has a lesson behind it and that is animal cruelty is bad i have an,0.15347219
animal lover right I'm there for the message I smell like did you bring them,0.39536232
to that planet to have that message in a Star Wars movie because it really,0.058605257
does detract from the movie as a whole it's clearly when the movie bogs down,0.0835471
I've seen a couple of people on Twitter say the movie feels too long it's,0.09663303
that scene if you take that out you could shave off a half an hour,0.15528783
off this movie I mean when it got to that that was cool for him,0.12825528
but that then brings me to phasma who is in this movie and it's not,0.31089434
like it's some big comebacks not like they were like oh we didn't really use,0.12956142
phasma in the last movie now here's her chance to shine that's like we didn't,0.15200308
use her in the last movie and she's just as useless here's the bum phasma,0.8060606
underwhelmed me snoke underwhelmed me yeah the big super baddie that was built up in,0.18731833
the first movie now we're gonna see more room here the movie and I mean,0.06962185
this in the most complimentary way goes in bold new direction unexpected directions things that,0.06597632
Star Wars really hasn't done and when you do bold directions in Star Wars with,0.04408668
established lore that nerds like me can kind of quantify sometimes you like mr. Spock,0.66109544
fascinating sometimes you're like han Solo that's not how the force works narrative Lee speaking,0.11775024
I cannot think of another Star Wars movie taking the same flight path proverbial flight,0.05534651
path the last Jedi Tech there are some things I love about that and there,0.04811981
are some things I just didn't like and that's why this movie's definitely one of,0.06565462
those movies it's like you might you're gonna have to watch this twice and I,0.1548698
really want to watch this movie again so I can really see if the flaw,0.14903091
still stick with me if I forgive them time fades everything time fades greatness and,0.15014757
time fades flaws all depends on which side of history and movies on guys in,0.08429474
the end the last Jedi is admittedly complex but there are a couple things in,0.07607151
this movie that leave you feeling unfulfilled Luke was great Rey was great kylo Ren,0.15100576
really everyone who was great in the first movie they're also great here but I,0.07044535
like about the movie is his deeper tones and its themes and the message about,0.052340437
heroes and people in general I really like that definitely enjoyable it's positive you should,0.064002134
go see it this movie has moments of greatness like character moments that I'm going,0.08308907
to remember this movie also has judgment calls that leave me feeling underwhelmed and unfulfilled,0.07122371
and it's all about how much the frustrating things frustrate you did they frustrate you,0.22298615
as much as they frustrated me I'm gonna do the responsible thing here as I,0.15054235
feel this movie is a two time wash before I write it up not giving,0.06639835
a rating yet because giving a rating ultimately would be unfair to both of us,0.09691956
this is why this review was so vague that if I give a rating now,0.14277822
for you guys you'll be like you gave that rating but you didn't give a,0.11624862
good reason as to why I got that rating the things you love the things,0.08731163
you hated where it why does it stand there so you'll feel cheated and unfulfilled,0.43486732
I just think in a world where YouTube's like a ruins got to get it,0.18177673
up now did you see your feet at 9 a.m. this morning 9 a.m. Tuesday,0.123699896
morning yeah that went bananas because we all of us YouTube people like we got,0.17490622
to get the reviews up right when the embargo lifts so we all do it,0.041926652
at the same time we all have to mad scramble I feel like I haven't,0.10559241
processed this movie enough to actually write it up so I feel like the responsible,0.070424095
thing to do we just hold off on the writing let you know how I,0.14056665
view the movie on my initial run-through that's done yes here we are neither of,0.06901594
us benefit from a rating today so if I'm going to write this movie I,0.0738396
will write it in my spoiler video which I will upload this weekend after I,0.10321623
watch the movie again so star wars the last Jedi have you seen it what,0.10331948
did you think about it or have you not what are you looking forward to,0.15504648
whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what,0.13410687
