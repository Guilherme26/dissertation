I'm going to be reviewing the movie spotlights,0.10839863
and when we're talking about it from the perspective of a journalist who has to manage a lot of content and make sure that it's you know good quality and make sure that it meets a certain criterion especially with regards to ethics,0.08256634
so the movies based on Catholic priest who were caught abusing specifically molesting young boys and the story was very sensitive,0.46987507
it was going to target the Catholic priest,0.2903309
I was going to be targeting the church and there was going to be very difficult challenge for the journalist to really uncover such a hidden story but they did it very well and in doing,0.099093445
so they taught their audience a lot about,0.05970427
you know the things that go with journalism,0.070557974
one of the things that they really dealt with was the importance of transparency you have to be as a journalist when you're interviewing people be transparent you have to let them know the agenda of the interview and go straight to the point don't you know beat around the bush and try to pretend as if you're sort of counseling them or providing them,0.16500868
with some sort of therapy,0.23198316
these are people who seek closure they want a story to be told and they're not interested in you know sort of dealing with the emotional part they want a story to be told so that they can give you know voice to the voiceless another aspect that was dealt with in the movie was the importance of face to face interviews in the movie it has shown that face to face interviews are very important because they give you more insight into the person that you're interviewing one of the victims,0.085921146
I was interviewed apparently had some physical marks,0.14677888
I think he had bruises or something like that,0.19897167
and it was important for them to take note of that and keeping track of what is being said by taking notes as references it's very important because you cannot just say something happened or someone says something without a reference,0.053253867
so you know old-school pen and paper always works because you know I need something that is easy something that is on the move you know where you can easily take notes,0.113685876
and the last aspect,0.09715546
I think was very important was trusting your gut feeling doesn't matter,0.15162696
how bad you think a story will be,0.15046076
but if you go with your gut instinct if you feel that the story has substance then follow through with it,0.10403903
and you know do your research do your interviews and I think that's that's what spotlight really did touch on it touched on the importance of journalistic ethics,0.13761525
and I think it's a fantastic movie for any aspiring journalist so definitely recommend it for anyone,0.1533219
