"Today we're talking about the film Ladybird First, I'm gonna look at this screenplay"
"Second, the cinematography"
"Third, I'm gonna take the things that I noticed and apply it to a scene of my own and fourth lemma"
To show you guys how I did it
This screenplay gives us an excellent understanding of the rollercoaster that is in some way reminiscent of each audience members coming-of-age story
This is relatability that helps us empathize with the characters
It also emphasizes the profound moments by contrasting them with the small petty scenes that surround them
Take a look at these two examples
Notice how the first scene is made all the more profound by the scene that follows it
"Well, you can't be scary and more I think you can"
Your mom is your gay
Can you not tell anyone please? I'm so sorry about everything
I'm so ashamed of all of it
It's just it's going to be bad and I just need a little bit of time to figure out how I'm going to tell my mom and dad this is good
Maybe you should have looked at
It's only half an hour away
Less if you're driving fast to undergraduate school
They're not the smart people
Go to Davis felt Berkeley had to accept me
You and Miguel went there
I'm a legacy
Not if we don't give money and you get bad grades
"What do you know about it Meaning nothing? Third, this screenplay is an excellent example of show"
"Rather than tell you, the cinematography of this film was meant to feel like a series of photographs capturing memories from her gross childhood"
Take a screen grab from nearly anywhere in the film and it could go right in your photo album
This film had a very simple style of cinematography and I think it fit very well with the story
"The story was about real life, and the cinematography felt like it"
"The whole film was shot on a tripod and dolly with one hand held shot and no Steadicam, which I think is pretty interesting for a film shot in the 21st century when there's so much big cinematic movement"
"Also To note, the focal lengths all seem very normal"
There wasn't anything extremely wide or extremely telephoto
This gave the film a really human feel
"Now, think about what this movie might have looked like"
"If Michael Bay, I'm not going to punish you"
"Oh, why not? it was a sister"
Cheetah and I drove all the way home before we noticed people were talking
Really
"To be fair, I wasn't just married to Jesus"
It's been 40 years
"Well, he's a lucky guy"
"So after looking in the film, here's my take on the style of Lady Bird"
"Hey, how's it going? What you're doing? You're so annoying"
Do you want? I just want to talk to you
What do you want? I just want to talk to you
You don't ever just want to talk
What do you want? You never talked to me
All I want is for us to communicate
The only communicating you do is between you and your cereal
"Yeah, it's seriously good"
you know what I'm done
Have fun with your cereal
Oh wait
it's mine
I'd pay for that
so with this shot I basically want to see how well I could replicate the dynamic range
Basically had a few options
Blows off
Number one
I could have raised the ambient light in the room to match that of the outdoors with my prosumer lights and the high ceilings
This wasn't really an option
A second
I could have decreased the life in the window
I could have done this with sheets of Nd
"Now I didn't have an in hand, but we've used this in the past on other productions and it's been pretty effective"
My guess on how big did this one set was by pushing some extra light into the ceiling and then adding flags in the foreground to keep the light off the actors
"My impromptu solution was cutting the light slightly, but the shears, and then allowing the window to be overexposed by a stop or two afterwards, I realized I could have taken the exposure down on all three shots because the foreground and the original scene is actually pretty dark"
Second
I wanted to duplicate how a lot of the dialogue scenes were shot in this film
First a wide 50/50 and then two over the shoulder shots
Third was the color grade
Here's the shot before new color grading
"First, I took her still from the movie scene and then I dropped into my timeline"
In the color panel
I went down to the color wheels and matched tab
"I clicked on comparison view, and that's at the comparison to the frame from the video I wanted to match"
Next
I clicked apply match and waited for it to analyze
Make any adjustments you want From there
Finally I jumped over to the effects window and edit effect noise at 3% strength to make the footage look like it could have been shot on film
And that's it
Good
good
It's serious
"Yeah, it's seriously good"
