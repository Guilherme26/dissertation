So mission impossible fallout is the sixth film in the twenty-two-year-old franchise and it is a direct sequel to 2015's Mission Impossible rogue nation So this movie contains a couple of firsts for the franchise first off it is the first time that they have ever done a direct sequel to the previous film the other movies in this franchise are standalone stories with relational connections to the previous films this movie is a direct sequel to the story of 2015's rogue nations So I would highly recommend that you re watch rogue nation before you watch this film the second first in this movies It's the first time that a director has returned to do a second movie in the franchise Chris McQuarrie directed rogue nation And he's come back to direct this film as well because it is a direct sequel to his other film rogue nation But before I give my thoughts on the movie if you love to talk movies so much so that your friends think you talk too Much about movies go ahead and join us down in the comments section We would love to talk movies with you all day long Tell us your thoughts on this movie as well as the franchise in general with that said let's get started talking about the good what I love about this film is the World-building sort the sixth film in this franchise and what it wisely does to distinguish itself from the previous five films is try and tie The world together of this franchise what I mean by that is we start to understand There's some direct Sixth the film and that just makes us feel like this is a bigger world Not just these kind of cool standalone stories, but in a world that's being inhabited by these characters along those same lines It continues the themes from the previous film about the consequences of actions and in doing so we start to dig a lot deeper Into Ethan hunts character instead of him just being seen as kind of like this unstoppable Action hero this movie dives into his psyche and the consequences of everything that he's gone through in the previous times It takes a toll on him and we start to get little pictures of what that looks like. Another thing The movie does well is it gives us a very clear Story we know exactly what Ethan is trying to get the warheads and what the consequences Are if he doesn't get to them in time This also gives a sense of urgency in tension throughout the entire film and what gives the movie complexity is the different characters and their motives, and we're not always sure what Everyone is trying to do in each scenario and who is betraying who in each situation? So while the basic story is fairly straightforward it has a lot of nuance to it because of the interesting characters that Populate the film speaking of interesting characters this movie has an amazing cast now we know the returning cast are great in these roles and have amazing chemistry with one another but we had some new favorites into the mix with Angela Bassett as kind of this higher up in the government who's not Necessarily on the side of the IMF and who sends along an operative Henry cavill to kind of try and watch over the team and make sure these nukes are returned No matter what and Cavill just makes form. It's an interesting role for him He's playing against his usual type where he's playing the charming lead here. He's kind of while he's on the team. He's Antagonistic towards the team and just makes for an interesting fun kind of tension and dynamic to see him in a different type of role He also has an amazing mustache in this movie that had dire consequences for the movie Justice League I tried to do my own little Henry Cavill mustache, but I forgot to grow it out starting a week ago so I didn't really pull it off as well as I would like to but he pulled off the physicality like you feel him as a physical presence in the room and he plays against Like the the jokey humor of Simon Pegg and you know the Tom Cruise grin and everything like that So he's just an interesting new dynamic to add in to the mix here Also the villain from rogue nation returns in this film I've been critical of him and rogue nation because I thought that character just seemed off Visually the way they made him look I just didn't make him feel scary and intimidating to me and that's different in this film He just has a different look because of where he's at in life and what's happened since the previous film and he he fits the role much better in this film and gives off the right vibe and Menacing ambience around him. Once again the action here is great whether you're talking about motorcycle chases through crowded Traffic filled European cities or helicopter chases with Tom Cruise Dangling underneath the helicopter as usual for this franchise. The action sequences are memorable. They're iconic They're exciting and they're just shot So well like in this movie there's kind of an infamous stunt in the movie where Tom Cruise got injured and the film was delayed for a couple of months and They'd showed kind of the shots of It in some of the trailers a little bit and they kind of would there have been some leaks of the footage on like TMZ? and stuff like that the shot in the movie is Awesome. I mean just so well choreographed if you kind of know the history of the accident and everything like that You know what? It's coming and it's it's great if refrigerates That's had quite a few great Hand-to-hand fight sequences the bathroom fight in this one might be the best hand-to-hand fight scene inside of the franchise and one final Positive while the movie has all the action that the film's are known for it also has all the spy trickery that the TV show is known for with the masks that disguises the sets all the Fun spy stuff where they're just kind of messing with people's heads It's got all the stuff that Mission Impossible is known for from there We will move on to the bad in the big- on this film Is this just a lot of things about the film that were very? Predictable and for me, I rewatched all the films in the franchise over the last month And so maybe I've just got a lot of Mission Impossible on the mind. I'm thinking very mission of possible esque, but every single time there is a moment in the movie where there's a bit of a reveal where the audience would a little bit I Saw it coming at the very beginning of the scene. I knew what was about to happen every single time They tried to pull a trick on the audience. I can see it coming This is both true of individual sequences as well as the story overall also with the film I feel like it's almost victim of our expectations of the franchise and what I mean by that is that Several of the last films have had so many of these iconic stunts that the level of Expectation has gotten a little bit too high So going back to that Dubai sequence where Tom Cruise was dangling on the outside of a building and then they followed that up with Tom Cruise's dangling from a plane as it takes off That's just the level of expectations so high that there's not really Anything you can do to top it at that point in time So while the helicopter sequence in the building jump are great action sequences that are very well shot It doesn't feel like they top what came before feels like they were trying to do something to top it But it doesn't quite work And you know by this point I'm when you've had him on the outside of the plane and you've had him on the tallest building there's not much you really can do because you can't exactly do a top and critias space jump in Mission Impossible 7 So that's why I say that the film feels like a victim of our expectations for it from there I got one more negative and the third act feels like it was dragged out a little bit too long there's a time element that plays into the mix and it seemed like they were repeating some shots in some elements for the sake of Filling up the amount of time that needed to pass but overall. This is a great exciting addition to this franchise overall, if I were to rate this one, I wouldn't fit a Solid a this is what I wanted out of this movie It's delivering what this genre is supposed to deliver and on an entertainment level. I would go with a nine out of ten This is a great spy film It is a great action film and it does a great job of tying this franchise together there's not a lot of times where you get to the sixth element of franchise and it's one of the best and that's Impressive with this franchise. That's kind of been firing on all cylinders for about ten Years now, so that's my take on the movie. How about you did you love it? Did you hate it? Did it live up to the hype or did it disappoint you a little bit? I would love to hear your take on this one. Also, I reviewed all the movies in this franchise You can check that out right up here lite the fuse That's not good I like this shirt and I just set it on fire
