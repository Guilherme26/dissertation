movies of the year because i love the trailer for the film I'm talking specifically,0.019055516
about the Johnny Cash trailer when I saw the trailer for this movie I thought,0.023254821

the stranger deserves an Oscar for it because it's incredible and now that I've seen,0.09708688

food and feel of the film this is a gut-wrenching powerful emotional beautiful film it's,0.042672195
like the dark knight of Marvel films in the definite transcends the comic book genre,0.01919454

so yeah I used to confirm that what everybody's raving about them and everybody said,0.06677779
this movie is amazing yes that's right this movie is awesome so let's begin and,0.034274254
start talking about the softly things that i like but Logan not really the r-rating,0.06607402
thank you Dark Knight trilogy for existing and letting us have some best tweet comic,0.053214025
book storylines with respect and take them serious and thank yous s fools for learning,0.43002895
to use know that you can make an already comic book film and it can,0.04561231
be good and it can be relatively successful because without those two things we would,0.02320094
not have had Logan and now we have Wolverine unleashed so we finally get to,0.030947668
see what we actually kick some ass decapitating head dismembering people is adamantium claws or,0.74383014
bloody and they are shots in people's faces and it was glorious and awesome the,0.65860647
number two thing I liked about Logan is the moon this film is a very,0.017812952
heavy dark slow him it really reflects the way that Logan fields in this film,0.09743344
he's old tired and beaten emotionally and physically it's not the usual light-hearted kind of,0.20938052
film that you find in x-men franchise film it feels more like a Western or,0.025139285
low-budget independent film then it does a big blockbuster comic book franchise film this one,0.03517358
is very contained and very small then maybe like one exclusion in the whole thing,0.036983546
and that's not bad thing it's a very slowly paint film but it was beautiful,0.03042683
and there was space there for new arms and character development and emotional development fluid,0.027102243
this film is kind of like the last of us and always darkness an awesome,0.03714718
this one also looks amazing it's shot really well i loved how logan looks and,0.2794551
how old and beaten he loved he has a big beard and his face is,0.56412345
all my stuff and he's all scarred Professor X also looks like he has one,0.18361597
foot in the grave to the sooner this dark gritty mood that I really enjoyed,0.2610989
and it had this really nice serious tone throughout the song but it really fit,0.022910256
well with the story in a china shop the number one thing I liked about,0.049733784
Logan was the performances Hugh Jackman attractive stewards bring out the big guns for this,0.06645717
one but the steward plates an old and destroyed Professor Xavier he still has a,0.18492238
little bit of hook and trying to do the best he can for the mutants,0.29108706
but at the same time you can tell that life has really taken poor on,0.032650538
him it's not the professor x that we are used to an adoring to us,0.03455363
but it's also beautiful and engaging of course this film relies heavily on the performance,0.03853542
of the young girl who plays a young mutant Laura played by Jack McKean and,0.056925084
if she will be good in this film this one would have crashed and burned,0.32720822
however this girl is perfect this girl had two hits two things she has to,0.18903123
be engaging and not annoying and you got to like her and root for her,0.06462126
and at the things like she had to be amazing an action sequences and she,0.026906678
checked both boxes very well I loved watching her as X 23 she is monstrous,0.12880017
which is fighting she's an animal and see what the film without even having to,0.109854415
speak she gives such an amazing performance was just looking at people and her team,0.03579686
with hugh jackman is also just like a father's daughter master president thing happening and,0.049051307
it's the emotional core of the film but of course at the end of the,0.017474374
day this is Hugh Jackman film this is Wolverine show and huge ointment put in,0.13690211
his all in his performance of Wolverine this is a very unique thing for me,0.03467802
because I haven't watched a character to be played by the same actor for 17,0.016903646
years so to watch Hugh Jackman's grow from the younger green the receipt for the,0.02076903
first time in the first x-men to this old man Logan it's just so amazing,0.17583065
it's captivating he plays Logan at the edge of his sanity the edge of his,0.05311292
collar and he's just so tired and you can tell that his heart has been,0.035326574
ripped to shreds and it's on his face it's in his eyes it's in the,0.27487895
way he walks and talks new Jackman really excelled in missile it's definitely his best,0.14276238
performance it's definitely for me that special Marie we've ever seen on screen I loved,0.050001856
it as always no movie it's perfect and now i'm going to talk about the,0.045392796
story things that i personally didn't like about Logan numbers the exposition I just don't,0.02754592
feel it the film handle exposition seen as well as i would have liked it,0.01572095
to a very specific example of that is when cell phone footage is used to,0.018728245
explain the background story of the young mutants and where she came from and a,0.06317914
lot of movies do this where they show you footage on a cell phone or,0.05657919
on a computer or on a USB and obviously edited to be a month ice,0.024415566
cream but it's filmed in a terrible way so it's in a cell phone that,0.028780501
doesn't happen in real life and what annoying is that there's a very easy solution,0.09529288
to this kind of thing where you can just open the phone and show us,0.02678096
the disc multiple footage is and videos and the character can go through them and,0.03647069
then the montage happens in the film itself then we as an audience can understand,0.018307185
that this is part of the film not that it actually in the fourth edited,0.03984317
and ready to be viewed as a ready-made montage delivered to your doorstep again it's,0.04177087
a nitpick but when you happen in logan in an early cuz i self that,0.048519824
the film was better you were better than that Logan movies you're burned it the,0.10526398
number two thing i don't like about Logan was the character of cannabis not weekly,0.017411847
I didn't not like the character of Caliban the whole time I just hope that,0.013836485
sometimes we spent a little bit too much time with them specially somewhere down in,0.11055086
the middle of the film and it actually kind of slowed the film down I,0.028533718
would have rather stayed with Wolverine and with Professor X and with Laura rather than,0.02698517
spend so much time on Caliban wasn't really that necessary the number one thing I,0.032532137
didn't like about Logan is surprise surprise the villain so the suppose it means villain,0.045025617
in the film is the cycle Donald peers he has he's like a full metal,0.0667279
alchemist thing going on I mean he was okay and he pushes the plot forward,0.05441801
he leads the corporation that's trying to hunt them down I understand his presence from,0.1929179
a plus point of view but at the same time he didn't do much for,0.03203857
me was very forgettable and also trying to stay away from spoilers here but at,0.021655053
the same time they had certain tools and characters that popped up that I found,0.059124183
a little weird and didn't enjoy much the first time I saw the song the,0.03177183
second time I saw the film that character and that weapon worked a little bit,0.04211544
more for me and I kind of warmed up to it but clearly he wasn't,0.03181773
one of my favorite things so it's the least favorite thing i had about Logan,0.031655423
that's why I said number one so all in all Logan is an incredibly directed,0.057708673
written films and performed movie I love it it exceeded my expectations it was amazing,0.05746987
and it's the perfect send off to a beautiful character that I've been experiencing any,0.07238595
loving for the last 17 years he's totally gonna be invisible to I'm calling it,0.03018803
but a big giant salute to few judgment and his amazing run as this character,0.08173178
I'm so happy but if Silver's happen and I'm so happy that it does not,0.0590111
disappoint me and for that reason I'm going to give logan and 9 out of,0.11519318
10 so have you seen no gift you love it as much as I do,0.059285823
