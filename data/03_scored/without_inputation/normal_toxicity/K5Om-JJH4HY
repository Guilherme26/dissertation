I'm reviewing us Jordan peels follow-up to the smash success get out Jordan Peele wrote and directed this joint and producer I always wonder how producer critics work in terms of how much they have to put up for the movie and how much they get paid,0.08791498
when it does,0.047559783
well,0.039254032
I'm always wondering that like you know when you when you produce,0.10246068

but how much are you putting up like,0.16589522
the budget is 20 million did you put up to 20 million,0.08523559
oh you put up a fraction of that and then the other studios absorb some of the calls too,0.072992116
I always wondered that anyway that's neither here,0.06909463
nor there that's a different conversation,0.07268958
yeah Jordan Peele man and Jordan Peele has everybody excited,0.18036696
yeah he's the new it director right now and his warranted get out was fantastic,0.19414267
everybody loved it,0.061130382
it was a game-changer,0.05447163
you know the follower wheel a yes follow up,0.05771197
let's go an original idea in the original concept,0.081561364
and since I'm doing the review late it made 71 million dollars,0.06265381
over the weekend which is the note to Hollywood people want original stuff,0.05738975
you don't have to remake everything you know say you don't have,0.13122658
this you'll have to give a sequel to every movie that made a little money man original concepts can work as well,0.16309518
that's not a shot to Halloween,0.16202076
you know I wanted to see,0.0778105
Michael Myers again he was disappointed but still I respected him coming back in the conjuring movies I would like to see another one,0.11622954
but I'm just saying like you know the original concept can work,0.06630712
this this movie I don't want to give too much away,0.14085409
this is very like anything can spoil this movie,0.11042642
so it's gonna be a weird review but it's about a family that comes across their doppelgangers and like the doppelgangers are you know they're not here on good terms,0.11088265
so it's like you know you're chilling with your family,0.2453076
and then you see these people that look exactly like you,0.14524986
but they told you no saying you,0.118013404
were out here looking fresh to devil your doppelganger looking raggedy and look like he got ruffled up in a coffee machine and then he just standing there looking at you and it's like yo man this is creepy,0.37615016
it's creepy man,0.38375416
and that's what it's all about,0.060512763
how does this family survive the encounter with their you know raggedy doppelgangers or in the movie they called the tether,0.08794714
that's essentially what the movies about without,0.068326645
giving too much away it stars Lupita Nyong'o,0.10201954
I don't know if I said her name right,0.14183286
she's an Academy Award winner she was in Star Wars she did voice work for and she was also one of the stars and black panther and also her co-star that plays her husband in this play about Winston Dukes he was also a scene stealer in black pants,0.0521798
and it's funny those two met in college and acting workshop,0.1216887
so it's dope that they got to work together again on the professional to making that money,0.16004474
it was just dope to see from an acting,0.20361562
standpoint us is dope,0.3260843
one of the takeaways from this movie is Lupita's acting skills,0.15163273
it was just incredible to see her play two different versions of herself and it's funny like when you watch the movie the effects were so seamless on that you don't even notice it,0.08524207
you don't even realize it's the same people interacting with one of them like I legit forgot no that's the same people,0.1531108
you know say remembering Back to the Future to when it was a big deal,0.074374676
well they always bit-bit but you could kind of see the special effects at work haci,0.21791184
you know like when he threw the the Almanac to the other side of the car,0.10671943
you saw how fake the Almanac looked on the tall silver,0.38131115
but now you know they stepped it up a little bit and in us is seamless and you know it was probably probably easier because you know a lot of those scenes were darker,0.17171915
so you can hide the special effects within the dark scene,0.10719084
but it was still dope,0.23270693
but the acting though Oh Lupita's act,0.10505562
it was like two completely different,0.036032863
people was the same person,0.093686506
so a lot of you know a lot of people compared to Toni Collette,0.10099367
you know performance in the red interior last year which I feel like she should have got an Oscar nomination for,0.051790815
I don't know why she didn't I started watching the favorite with the lady that won Best Actress and I was like I turned it off but did something like the the time period in the wardrobe with a favorite the corsets and the big ridiculous hair and the women walking around like this just this is some castles and just shooting ducks die anyway that's neither here,0.59849757
nor there her performance was fired another takeaway from this movie man Jordan Peele,0.24534374
it's just a shout out to you know people that started in comedy like rooted in comedy improv comedy sketches I just like to see that it just shows the versatility of funny people like from the mind of Jordan Peele which many were introduced to him by a sketch show like MADtv can't feel,0.14860666
and now he's wish there was like creepy moving this like yo,0.35624614
the transition is dope,0.31464845
now he's about to do the twilight zone and it just goes to show that you know put your ideas forward man,0.15677014
you know don't worry about like nah nobody's gonna get it just do it just do it,0.11011614
and I hope he pops off is one of the major directors in the game like you know like when tan Tito - the the n-word every five scenes you know,0.15033816
st.,0.055245347
Quentin no,0.06734871
st. you see it too,0.07177431
much you write it too,0.07021156
much I should say so my review I can't really nitpick as if I mean if I nitpick I'm a,0.09012829
spoiler so I really need to do a spoiler review for this movie but I'm not gonna do,0.085947126
it but I enjoyed it like they were creepy moments there were tense,0.15467024
moments the acting really drew you,0.11497489
in and then this move this movie's gonna be polarizing a lot of people not gonna feel,0.11547592
it so if he was gonna feel it the people can get the underlying messages which may or may not be there like this is a movie where you can kind of interpret yourself and normally I'm not a fan of,0.058537494
that but I went in knowing that I went in knowing like it's probably gonna be some deeper level,0.03556187
stuff did we get a piece together ourselves,0.080796964
so I was like all right,0.08538601
okay,0.050967902
I was along for it,0.05360777
I feel like it's a lot of Easter eggs within the movie that will make you watch it again which is genius in itself,0.10592606
so I cared enough to watch it again,0.08028396
you know what I mean so that's a plus,0.15341297
I'm like go for the acting man just go for the acting,0.13551465
