what's up ladies and gentlemen its Daniel here from the geeks big nation Channel and,0.29801884
I'm here to bring you my review of Casablancas only one ever gave you the,0.1519233
impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape because my dear Ricky I,0.058174342
suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist Olaf if you will,0.40339053
but I have to be familiar with the record let me point out just two,0.020509064
items in 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia in 1936 you fought in Spain on,0.37253657
the loyalist side I got well paid for it on both occasions the winning side,0.10957686
would have paid you much better robbery haha well it seems that you're determined to,0.15989617
keep Laszlo here I have my orders well I see Gestapo spank My dear Ricky,0.5154597
you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo I don't interfere with them and they don't,0.24026881
interfere with me in Casablanca I'm master of my fate I am major Strasser is,0.1112204
here sir he was saying excuse me so you clicked on the video and you're,0.25579247
probably wondering to yourself why is Daniel reviewing the 1942-43 film because there was released,0.059360817
in the United States during that Casablanca what what about this film why is he,0.07662066
reviewing it so I am taking an independent study course underneath one of my professors,0.14896765
here at my college and so I'm gonna be working on films I'm gonna be,0.092010915
shooting short films and things that nature I'm really excited but it's as a part,0.40311688
of the course I'm writing essays about films and watching films and analyzing them and,0.109410524
so one of my first films was Casablanca and in what we're talking about right,0.096780784
now is American noir filmmaking and so this is gonna be a kind of artsy,0.18156374
fartsy when it comes of this review is I did a lot of time analyzing,0.31089434
specific elements about this film so with that guys I'm gonna be doing a lot,0.13822748
more of these classic films so keep that in mind because you know I just,0.25113776
want to find a way to incorporate what I'm doing in class into my own,0.12036758
personal life and continue to have fun with movies because I just love talking about,0.08247638
them so much so let's get on with this review 1942 Casablanca this film is,0.09103112
a classic by all means of the definition I can say that I don't really,0.060952548
watch many classical movies I don't know if it's really a fault to just mean,0.11366889
not taking the time out to go do that or I just haven't really had,0.055147167
much time to be introduced to them but nevertheless really really old classical films I,0.15373532
have really haven't had the chance to watch many of them I haven't seen films,0.07081227
like Citizen Kane but that's about it and so I need to really explain my,0.070856795
repertoire of classic films but sometimes when you go back and watch old black-and-white films,0.043715235
it in a certain sense it can't quite compare using Citizen Kane as example sometimes,0.08158812
for me as a modern movie goer in this current day and age it's different,0.095834054
for me you know I've seen movies like The Dark Knight I've seen you know,0.04975678
I've seen drive I've seen all these things that I loved or the prestige and,0.067208245
I've seen all these crazy movies that I love and I have had such an,0.3598348
impact of meat and have blown my mind so that when I go back and,0.13866898
watch something like Citizen Kane sometimes it gets hard for me to appreciate what that,0.116806954
film is because of the time period it came out in and just how far,0.09331195
it was pushing the boundaries and just how amazing of a film really is so,0.08772146
I try to push that aside and try to really analyze the film for what,0.05967463
it is and not only by modern standards but also just enjoy the film for,0.06768593
its value and the story that is trying to tell and how it tells it,0.04335105
but I can honestly say that Casablanca is an amazing amazing film and that it,0.057250667
is a film that transcends time in a sense that it no matter when you,0.11677579
watch it is always gonna have that same impact that no matter new goers for,0.11149114
this film or old ones the story is just so riveting and intense it's part,0.104709774
political thriller but also part you know American war film but also part melodrama and,0.14900923
part romance it's it's really really engaging and I really did not expect that going,0.058874015
into this film and just being really just blown away by just how engaged I,0.24000493
was watching this film as if it was just any other crime drama I had,0.116731115
just tuned into watching on cable or something like that I'm kidding no one watches,0.17126489
cable so Casablanca the story revolves around Rick played for the amazing Humphrey Bogart who,0.09125431
owns this you know this kind of gambling den the seedy kind of place inside,0.18453132
of the play inside of Casablanca the city underneath Nazi regime occupation and the story,0.3175993
revolves around him meeting this femme fatale from his past his former lover this former,0.11496857
flame here's looking to you kid who comes out of his past and comes back,0.27100474
to haunt him in a sense and comes back with the proposition based off who,0.16353728
she is with now and this whole entire political aspect that goes really into it,0.10251396
I don't know why I'm being so cryptic I mean the film came out in,0.10728518
1942 his former lover is buried - the leader of you know this political rebels,0.25519797
against the Nazi regime and what I found the most interesting about the film not,0.25950366
just that you know the commentary it had on you know the socio-political asked the,0.055581488
you know atmosphere at the time but the character of Rick himself was someone very,0.04491528
interesting to me I think even in the moment you're first introduced to Rick in,0.09804923
the film he is playing at a chessboard alone side room in in we we,0.077190496
spent a lot of time analyzing the lighting in this film because it is something,0.064493656
phenomenal just looking at the scene where you're looking at the gambling den it's bright,0.11024121
it's lively it's smoky it's hazy it has all these weird characters and guys going,0.16317317
around probably doing some not good things you know not blatantly out and open there's,0.09485261
nothing crazy like prostitution or anything like that going on something obvious going on but,0.66398716
you know the people in here are doing things going beyond that and this is,0.07516985
this world living in this world where refugees and human flesh you know human beings,0.63946
have price tags to them and human beings are just you know this this currency,0.3572442
during this time period and it's very you know it's very like engaging and just,0.0876669
makes your skin kind of crawl and when we're first introduced to Rick he's in,0.3492629
the side room playing chess like I said and the light the way the lighting,0.08309797
is you know it just illuminates his hands like he's playing this game or whatever,0.116701335
whatever a visual metaphor you want to go into there's a lot that you can,0.06249133
dissect from this film you know of this man who plays his game and the,0.15056948
whites but he the way the shadows are going it's like it's the shadows are,0.41520876
just really just making up you know the outline of his face and it's so,0.1664973
interesting as if he is a man who's you know created morphed and you know,0.29923075
just defined by the shadows his dark past which I found really interesting and that,0.06744129
he he is more so of an antihero and is not really a hero of,0.23966391
an of itself I think he is a man who has a good heart who,0.15262873
has good intentions he wants to do good in the world but he sees the,0.12840226
circumstances again and he's just a product of that and he's trying to adapt without,0.059895
fully losing who he truly is and it's such a powerful character and Humphrey Bogart,0.15361476
gives an amazing performance because he comes off as like you know this like he's,0.18322948
given this villainous introduction and he comes off as like this guy who just you,0.352374
know he's very smart he's a one step ahead of the next guy he doesn't,0.25049973
care about this he's just doing this to survive to just get on day by,0.15740074
day you know what drives this guy but when his ex-lover comes back into his,0.23119994
life and that changes who he completely is because when he goes into that drunken,0.38713723
tirade with Sam at the club and everything's closed down in the shadows are on,0.12251789
him again when he's going back reflecting into his past that shapes him and haunts,0.15235756
him you you get this this version of Rick it was just so broken and,0.14822817
so driven by his you know his his heartbreak his ache you know but how,0.1313971
much he was kicked down by the world and how much wrong has been done,0.32360277
upon him and that he's done upon others so interesting and just so riveting just,0.15007746
looking at Rick's character and all that he goes through I think the ex-lover played,0.050748706
by Ingrid I just typed the paper on this and I can't remember her last,0.22164658
name but actress Ingrid did a really amazing job as portraying the character that I,0.10741527
believed at the time wasn't very popular you know this very driven independent character who,0.05714052
can function without her partner and and but yet still enjoys and has desires and,0.32715926
there's nothing wrong having a character that's presented that doesn't have a care about you,0.10212121
know what others think of her and what she has and what she wants she's,0.09352494
gonna go for it no matter how selfish it is or you know just how,0.24086964
it benefits others she's going to try to go after what she wants and she's,0.15529665
a very strong character and it's very interesting and the way she also just like,0.049134504
Rick is conflicted about all that time they spent together and all this you know,0.07843744
there's turmoil they went through after separating due to various circumstances as you all may,0.06924288
know if you've seen the film I truly think it was just really really an,0.059789956
amazing performance by her and also the you know the Spanish officer who would help,0.06496245
the escape at the end and things of that nature who also plays more of,0.051676165
a villainous role there's just amazing performances in this film and some amazing uses of,0.05899328
lighting which is really key in this film and just how they use darkness and,0.06189338
I think that's a you know an a tribute to the characteristics of film noir,0.15801708
which I found really interesting and just what made the genre so great is its,0.04335283
atmosphere and just how engrossing it really is and I'm really glad I got a,0.08105574
sense of that going into the film but I think the only thing I didn't,0.045477714
really like about the film just the ending uh-oh which is really bold because I,0.06719132
mean come on it's one of the most iconic endings of all time you just,0.239957
looking at you kid and getting on the plane and everything you know this is,0.24220856
it's like the start of a beautiful friendship you know all that stuff but I,0.17214298
think I guess it's this comes I have to tribute the semi modern sensibilities but,0.054375686
the third act is just like it's kind of like I wouldn't say rushed but,0.0599767
it's just like it kind of suspends believability at certain parts because he just he,0.101221845
just shoots the Nazi commander and he's like hey the command has been shot gang,0.68869346
there's just like alright we're not gonna check your pocket we're not gonna check anybody,0.2424584
in this room right now who's in near this dead guy y'all just walk out,0.450125
of the hangar bay I actually expected a more tragic ending for Rick I think,0.0678971
his ending is gonna be inevitably tragic afterwards you know he's gonna be an enemy,0.332661
eventually of the Nazi regime and this and I think this from 1942 you know,0.31089434
warden until 45 so a lot can happen over those few years especially acting as,0.08100261
someone trying to work against the Nazi regime and just seeing the side redemptive quality,0.31089434
was really great but somehow that ending man was just really really weird it's really,0.14153723
weird and it's just like this is beginning of a beautiful friendship forget that part,0.091069184
where I tried to kill you I helped you know alright that's how it's gonna,0.794439
happen and he's just like okay okay you know what this is iconic I just,0.121258244
I guess I gotta just let this slide but besides that I really enjoyed Casablanca,0.07884713
and obviously really had a great time and see that it is a masterful work,0.077228494
of filmmaking and it is a film I really enjoyed and want to watch more,0.071395695
times than what I have and see it multiple times again even though I have,0.06978054
watched the heck out of this movie so with that ladies and gentlemen I'm going,0.31089434
to give Casablanca a 9 out of 10 so have you seen Casa Blanca let,0.10373353
