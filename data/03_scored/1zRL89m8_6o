oh god [Laughter] seven samurai is a film that came out in 1954 and is,0.08082679
written and directed by akira kurusawa so this is actually a film request from a,0.059212256
50 patron that you guys might know by the name of cynic the critic in,0.24034213
the comments section and he's been a longtime subscriber of mine and i really appreciate,0.09182681
him a lot and his channel is actually filled with reviews and ranked videos he,0.16960628
specifically came out recently with a stanley kubrick rank video that even though i have,0.15504637
my disagreements with him and he knows what they are in terms of the ranking,0.10529881
um it's actually a really well thought out video really fleshed out and you could,0.15643667
tell that he put a lot of time and effort and what he wanted to,0.045776356
say about these films and how you want to describe certain things so i would,0.17550796
highly suggest checking that video out specifically but really check out his whole channel but,0.08661521
anyway let me just make a quick shameful confession i have actually never seen an,0.19323957
akira kurosawa film before i know that's like kino blasphemy i've heard about him for,0.24373537
a very long time at least two or three years now i just never got,0.09181901
around to diving into his work and really exploring him as a filmmaker which is,0.09245107
why i was really excited when cynic requested for me to watch this film because,0.1859432
if i'm not mistaken 7 samurai is one of his most iconic and most popular,0.10096986
works that is pretty much loved by everybody and some even go as far as,0.07368261
saying that this is one of the greatest films ever made and now that i've,0.102133565
finally seen this film i completely understand why so many people love this film and,0.06827693
give it the high praise that they do i really enjoyed this film and i,0.080389306
really admired a lot about it despite its three hour and a half run time,0.055820636
yes this film is three hours and a half long which was kind of concerning,0.09944088
going into it because nobody wants to sit through a three hour and a half,0.12886506
film that they don't end up liking very much but luckily that wasn't the case,0.061530326
at all and honestly this is one of those films that are so entertaining and,0.11371495
character-rich that it really could have been five hours long and i could probably sit,0.075708166
through it and it wouldn't bother me at all and it's actually quite astonishing because,0.09958626
this film's premise and plotline is actually incredibly simplistic and there's not really much to,0.15133835
it it's essentially just about these village farmers who are under attack by these bandits,0.5154597
and they basically just go out and try to recruit a group of samurai that,0.117622
can really help protect them and their crops so you really wouldn't expect a film,0.09154412
that has that simple of a plot to have over a three hour run time,0.0750733
but where this film exceeds is just how incredibly rich all these characters are and,0.09566864
i really do mean all of the characters because don't get me wrong i love,0.11808493
the samurai characters and yes they are the most engaging part of the film obviously,0.05248722
but even the village farmer characters are actually quite memorable and stand out with their,0.049905267
own personalities and all kind of have their own arcs conflicts and flaws and that's,0.07862435
something that i've definitely noticed about a lot of korean and japanese filmmaking is that,0.109090954
they turn out to be quite character heavy and that's something that is just really,0.09807449
fun to look forward to when i go into a film like this and to,0.08800977
me seven samurai is the ultimate master class in character writing where not a single,0.11691598
character feels underwritten or underdeveloped and my personal favorite samurai character in this film which,0.10022165
is probably a lot of people's favorite samurai character in this film was uh kikichiro,0.17826977
i think is how you pronounce it he basically is like the unofficial drunken samurai,0.27901238
in this film and i thought his character was just like super entertaining and it,0.109432
was really interesting to see how his character unfolded throughout the film but one neat,0.0424578
thing that i personally noticed while i was watching this film was that there is,0.06935836
no way that quentin tarantino isn't deeply inspired by akira kurosawa films or at least,0.12015014
old classic japanese films in general because um not only is the strong emphasis on,0.1711739
character really apparent but even down to like the music choices and how they're used,0.058617316
throughout the film just had this classic heroic sound to it that reminded me a,0.049882155
lot of the same way that quentin tarantino would use in his films and there's,0.14458403
also this comedic element to the film as well which i found quite surprising because,0.05089603
i really didn't expect to laugh at this film as much as i did and,0.082385115
it just has this silly admirable charm about it that isn't like too outrageous to,0.53490317
the point where it'll take you out of the drama when it happens because this,0.15984201
film balances comedy and drama incredibly well the film has this constant incorporation and blending,0.06284071
of both genres throughout the film that never really took you out of the overall,0.104248405
mood and never made it to where like you couldn't take the dramatic aspect seriously,0.1540699
and the film didn't make you feel uncomfortable to where you couldn't laugh at the,0.059551965
silly comedic stuff because it's not it didn't feel like it was choppy or jarring,0.45301855
it just had this really smooth blend throughout the film which again is something that,0.027300538
strongly insisted that tarantino was deeply inspired by this film and other stuff like this,0.05422009
but what this film builds up to in the third act is quite astonishing considering,0.09230792
how ambitious it is with the scope of these giant action sequences because essentially the,0.0854103
third act of this film is just non-stop action but it's action that contains actual,0.094371304
heart and substance to it that made me feel a whole lot more invested in,0.052963667
it because you felt this genuine stakes for the characters when they were going through,0.051192995
moments of peril but even on top of that there is just a lot going,0.07450975
on with the amount of stunt work and coordination going on with these action sequences,0.09663228
because there are tons of people on horseback and there's just horses falling over and,0.09609744
people falling over and i'm i'm pretty sure horses got injured during this which is,0.106565826
kind of sad but just what it took to achieve what was occurring on screen,0.089106776
with that kind of magnitude is quite astonishing especially for something in the 1950s because,0.07000261
to be honest none of the stunt work in this film and none of the,0.11508123
action in here feels dated or cheesy and you would think that for something that,0.10899411
was made in the early 1950s that there would be some element of datedness or,0.05833341
cheesiness to it but it's not like it's all very believable it's all incredibly convincing,0.16303453
and for seven samurai to be able to achieve something like that over 70 years,0.06224832
ago is really impressive and it's something about the film that i truly admire and,0.059200507
one thing that i just thought was really cool and funny about the making of,0.08334129
this film which is something that i have to give cynic credit for because he's,0.2554591
the one that informed me about it is that apparently um akira kudosawa went over,0.07638802
budget multiple times during the making of this film and then when the producers were,0.0659056
were hounding him about it and basically telling them that like we're not gonna invest,0.10735178
money into you anymore he would just be like okay and then he would just,0.25327128
dip and then he would go fishing and which already is just like my kind,0.10597632
of guy because i love fishing but like eventually the the producers would be like,0.065030314
okay fine just just here just just take the money god damn it and that,0.72280073
apparently happened multiple times throughout production and i just think that's a really badass and,0.2477487
hilarious fact i thought was slightly bothersome when i was watching it and it's just,0.116224386
the fact that some of the writing throughout this film came off just incredibly on,0.08901435
the nose like in terms of the dialogue like there would be a handful of,0.17641875
moments in this film where something would already be pretty clear to the audience whether,0.05935556
it was shown visually or it was something that was demonstrated to through more clever,0.12693256
writing and then there would be like another type of character that would ask an,0.04996254
obvious question just to reassure that what was happening was really happening and there were,0.03487272
moments like that throughout this film that i was like damn like why why do,0.55382407
filmmakers feel like the audience just won't get something and maybe they're right but some,0.04345737
of this stuff was just really really obvious and it just seemed like why would,0.09969194
you take away from how beautifully you were able to craft that and convey that,0.18480754
information by just forcibly inserting dialogue that just double reassured to the audience what was,0.09186885
happening and i just didn't like that aspect of the film but it's a really,0.06659499
really minor aspect and most of the dialogue they're writing is really well done it's,0.061178327
just they were just little moments sprinkled throughout the film that would kind of have,0.04491469
that element to it i'm actually going to go ahead and give a quick example,0.06677068
of what i'm talking about because i just think for a film like this it's,0.12592284
important for me to actually demonstrate what i mean so if you haven't seen the,0.085388325
film yet i suggest covering your ears for the next 30 seconds to a minute,0.2092225
i'll make sure to put a spoiler tab up top so you know when it's,0.10316827
over but um this is what i'm talking about so when you have this great,0.10977268
scene where uh kikichiro gives his rant this really angry soulful rant um where he's,0.24232171
kind of chewing out all the samurai and how they're judging and viewing these farmers,0.12612635
it was just an excellent scene like everything about it really came together and again,0.05936128
what's so great about it is that it was able to tell you a lot,0.0828363
about his character in the sense that he came from a farming village himself and,0.08992911
he was raised a farmer and you know you didn't need any character to reassure,0.13023993
that in order for someone to understand it but yet after we get that excellent,0.10484252
scene where he just goes on this rant you have the other main samurai the,0.107264
film basically ask this really obvious question where he's like and it was just little,0.08801778
moments like that that happened throughout the film that would be bothersome to me because,0.06141392
it's it's kind of heartbreaking sometimes to see something be so excellently portrayed and then,0.06597563
um kind of diluted a little bit by having something like that in it but,0.14627072
again it's it's a really minor criticism it's not something that really dragged the film,0.10091705
down for me at all but it was something that was noticeable when i was,0.10336081
watching it because overall i still think that this is a nlgger magnificent film especially,0.30979583
for something that was created in the early 1950s and this is something that i,0.052493017
actually love like i actually love this film regardless of that flaw and it's something,0.1066341
that i really really want to buy on criterion i heard this is like the,0.06354834
second criteria never made which is really interesting i'm gonna buy the hell out of,0.15175119
that in the next november sale so i'm going to give seven samurai a nine,0.14681917
out of ten [Applause] one thing that i forgot to mention about this film is,0.08531205
that the camera work and the lighting in this film is just immaculate like there,0.065320864
are some shots in this film that i was just in awe by because i,0.13876283
was like that is a beautiful shot how the hell were you able to frighten,0.46796626
that so perfectly especially like it just seems like something that is so incredibly ahead,0.16957295
of its time and um for those who follow the channel you know that i,0.054807223
love me some brilliant aesthetic work and this film has some brilliant aesthetic work so,0.1047571
that was something that i really admired about the film as well but anyway i,0.047101405
hope you enjoyed what i had to say about seven samurai if you really enjoyed,0.1515492
