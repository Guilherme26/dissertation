the other toys belong to Bonnie they have to try to make sure her life is special and when Bonnie goes to her first orientation day for kindergarten she makes a toy out of a spork and this thing suddenly has consciousness and doesn't quite understand what it is but it was the first hint of joy for body on her orientation day because she was terrified of going to school and when this little guy called for key wants to run away Woody and Buzz and the other toys have to try to make sure they can bring him back which starts a whole nother adventure they didn't expect now before I get any

I don't think I'd be reaching to say that the majority of us were worried about this movie as a trilogy taury Story 1 2 & 3 was highly satisfying critics liked it people liked it it ended really well I was honestly terrified about this film I tried to remain optimistic and hopeful about film but when it came to Toy Story 4 I did find myself cynical because when you have a trilogy that's actually satisfying it's kind of scary when they decide to make another one Raiders of the Lost Ark Temple of Doom Last Crusade it's done Bourne Identity supremacy and ultimatum done it's really hard to make a good trilogy that's as satisfying as the Toy Story trilogy was and so when they said they were gonna make another one I was really concerned I walked out of a movie a few weeks ago and I heard somebody behind me they passed the Toy Story 4 poster and they said there is no way that that movie is going to be good I cannot wait to see that movie and laugh at it because it's going to be awful and I remember thinking Jesus like that's a little much they haven't even made a bad toys Story movie yet hell they haven't even made a mediocre Toy Story movie yet they're all great I was cynical about this movie and I was really worried about it and when I sat down the theater I thought to myself this movie can do nothing but surprise me but I wasn't like this is going to suck I really wanted it to be good and it really surprised me this film was a blast from start to finish and extremely emotionally satisfying and I do believe that Toy Story 4 has the potential to become maybe the prime argument whenever someone is defending the continuation of a franchise beyond its initial completion I thought three was the perfect ending and I didn't really see them doing anything else with these characters and what I was really concerned about was the fourth film just being yet another episodic adventure and there are times where it feels like that but it was so well done that I didn't care and then without telling you anything it's like oh you were doing things with these characters I see where you wanted this to go yes in some ways the film is easily able to say let's do some more which is a little business and commerce' you know and you're like oh I see when you're doing and doing more more movies but if they're going to be this good I'm fine with it let's talk about Josh Cooley what a feature debut this is beautifully directed the way he moves characters in and around the screen the action sequences the emotional beats he does a terrific job this is a really really well-made movie and the animation has gotten to the point where it is [ __ ] photorealistic there's an opening sequence where the entire scene is in the rain and there's characters underneath a car and there's these little beads of water just dropping off of the pipes it looked real it did not look like animation it is insane the level of animation Pixar has reached what's also really tough to do in a franchise like Toy Story is have a brand new villain every time because the Toy Story films they don't have like a continuing villain storyline and so they have to have a new thing every time and what they do here really was unexpected to me at first it was almost like a horror movie which reminded me of Sid in the first film and I've always loved how dark that film got the very first one where buzz looks at them they're cannibals I remember even when I was like eight years old I was like oh [ __ ] [ __ ] cannibal toys I didn't say those words but that's what I was feeling inside the introductory scene for this character there is a shining reference with the choice of music and I was like yep I'm on board you got me in fact that's not the only Kubrick reference in the film there's another one for 2001 Space Odyssey if you're listening very closely they play around a lot with the villains storyline in this movie to make it different and it goes in a direction that I really didn't expect it to and it was not something I could have predicted which is great it just it somehow surprised me I don't know how this children's film the fourth and the franchise did but it did but one of the most important storylines in the film is this new toy made from a spork that Bonnie names for key and Woody is trying to protect this thing because it's so important to Bonnie like I said it was that one connection she made on that first orientation day that made her think okay maybe school is gonna be alright so woody naturally feels very protective of his kid and wants to make sure she's safe and happy so now he's got to protect forky who has no idea what the hell's going on he doesn't know he's a toy doesn't know what he is and it's not exactly the same as like the Buzz Lightyear woody dynamic from the first one where buzz thought he was a real Space Ranger this is different this is like a weird amalgam nation of something that has been created and it has no idea exactly what it is and so what he has to make sure this thing is protected and in that way we get a lot of scenes where he's essentially being a father which was one of my favorite themes about the film protecting those we love how far is too far how far is overprotective you know and a lot of that comes into bo-peep in this movie which is just the best that character has ever been easily like she got a major upgrade as a character and she's awesome here and the movie does play a lot with the relationship between Woody and Bo Peep while in the first film it was sort of like a flirtatious relationship that had absolutely no depth to it here we have a fully fleshed out relationship and it's handled beautifully when it comes to comedies I'm a tough laugh I like clever humor I like humor that makes me think about a situation or something that we're normally thinking of or just very crass humor dry humor and when it comes to Toy Story 4 there's surprisingly a lot of that there's actually a few offensive jokes even and I was like okay this franchise still understands that in the first one we had Buzz Light beer and we had the word I'm searching for I can't say because there are a preschool toys present getting kind of tense aren't you so we have a scary horror like set up with the villain characters and some adult humor in other words this movie didn't play it safe which I was really afraid it was gonna be this squeaky clean 2019 Disney movie but it this is a Pixar film I didn't feel like I was watching like a studio movie that checked all the boxes Pixar knows their [ __ ] and they did a damn good job making this movie and it really surprised me when it comes to the emotional beats I didn't expect to be as wrapped up in it as I was and again I I don't want to give you any details but there comes a point in the film where you sort of realize what they were doing with the characters what at one point in time did feel kind of episodic suddenly becomes more than that and you realize holy [ __ ] you were setting this up all along and I never even considered that and the waterworks just and I was done and like I think I lost it more in this movie than did in Toy Story 3 even as far as new characters go Duke KABOOOM voiced by Keanu Reeves is awesome he's a Canadian stunt man and he's hilarious it was a perfect role for Keanu Reeves key and Peele played two plushies that can be won at a carnival they were really funny all of the new characters especially for key risk being annoying because they're around a lot and I never was in fact four key was actually really sweet and I couldn't believe that I liked him because when I saw the teaser I was like oh [ __ ] he's gonna annoy me I just know it I [ __ ] know it but no I actually really liked that character and I know this isn't a reference to the anime but if you happen to be a fan of the very obscure anime buh buh buh buh buh buh buh there's a scene where you will not be able to help but hear that title in your head I know it's not a reference to that show but as a fan of anime and you know I knew if that show I was like haha that's funny that they just gotta set it there really was no dull moment in Toy Story 4 there was never a scene that I felt dragged it felt shorter than its runtime it was consistently entertaining and it is yet again another fantastic Toy Story movie if I were to try to talk about flaws I feel like I would be reaching a lot like I mean it's like it's there I know I could find it it's right here oh yeah I found a flaw look at me good for me I would say my only issue with the movie is that I wish there were more woody buzz scenes there's some heartfelt stuff there's just not a lot it wasn't this movie's focus and to me that relationship has really anchored these films would have liked to have seen a little more of that and like I said there are times where this adventure they're on does feel a little inconsequential until you see where they're going with it and you're like oh okay so this actually was necessary to get to that point I understand that now that's it this is a [ __ ] great movie I am blown away by how good this movie was I did not expect it to be this good so maybe go in with that mentality go in expecting to be underwhelmed and maybe you'll have a good time with it I'm gonna give Toy Story 4 and a I am just I'm I'm so happy that this movie didn't suck I really honestly thought it was going to I really did I was just I don't usually get cynical about movies like this I was just like it kind of started to affect me like why do we need this movie it doesn't have to happen and then you know I sat there and it was great so yay you know forget those thoughts just go enjoy yourself have a good time guys thank you so
