in the revenant I'll say it again for Sally Hawkins in here the best work,0.025644826
an actor can do is saying absolutely everything and anything without uttering a single word,0.02736499
Sally Hawkins does that in here her character is absolutely lovable and whimsical and you,0.02390936
cannot help but fall in love with her she reminds me a lot of Amelie,0.21126498
as well as the film as a whole it is Amelie meets of monster film,0.17725216
but the film doesn't necessarily follow the tropes of a monster movie it has one,0.070730306
single element from those films but it never falls onto those cliches it carries this,0.06148093
love story throughout and it is committed to that love story throughout it never feels,0.022548396
cheesy it also feels earned because of the commitment del Toro has to this story,0.023639962
and is audacity as some of the things that he makes happen in this story,0.020854173
without spoiling anything Michael Shannon as the villain is also very layered he's menacing and,0.078912064
terrifying there's a lot that you can read into his character also Michael Stuhlbarg who,0.06541083
has another amazing performance in 2017 after call me by her name and Richard Jenkins,0.026042605

beyond those mesmerizing visuals and the amazing performances also the well-developed characters in this film,0.024745496
there's also a recurring theme throughout and that is the lack of a sense of,0.030907758
belonging and the sense of feeling like an outcast all the characters in this film,0.032018613
in their own way find themselves in this place in life where they don't feel,0.095182456
like they belong and or they don't feel like they have fulfilled everything they should,0.065493315

a living being has not looked at her and was not taken aback by the,0.03460751
fact that she was mute they learned to communicate with each other very organically and,0.083695404
they are learning with each other and they don't have any prejudice or bigotry towards,0.028961431
each other whatsoever and that's a bond that this film explores deeply well and in,0.02223975
a very loving way even Michael Shannon as the villain as I said there's a,0.07183717
lot of layers to him because he doesn't feel necessarily fulfilled he's working under some,0.028423296
people that he doesn't think he should be working under of also Michael Stuhlbarg without,0.043878175
spoiling anything he also is an outcast in his own way he's a scientist who,0.13596088
wants to research the creature with very very pure intentions and Richard Jenkins as I,0.088784054
said amazing performance what his character goes through in the silmas beautiful arc really fits,0.026347259
