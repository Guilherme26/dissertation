oh my goodness it's going to update youtube this is sel 0320 representing JVS i'm,0.0396363
back here for a brand new movie review the name of this movie is spotlight,0.030257208
i am going to be doing two different reviews of this or overviews i should,0.026350586
say there's going to be one concrete review is going to be completely non-spoiler i'm,0.021366363
not gonna reveal anything about the plot unless you want I should know about the,0.026834173
real based on true life events this movie is based on but the second one,0.03476316
is going to be from a different perspective that's all I can say I'll say,0.01885064
that towards the end the name of the movie is called spotlight it stars Mark,0.016741343
Ruffalo Michael Keaton Rachel McAdams leave us Mulder um shoot even got John Slater in,0.128276
this movie but this is the status of the movie a true story of how,0.019076137
Boston Globe uncovered a massive scandal um of child molestation and the cover-up of the,0.3629267
specific Catholic Church and that's all I'm kind of gonna read but it's so much,0.044007886
more than that normally I don't read snaps it to come on IMDb because they,0.043067314
revealed way too much about the stories um you know transparent plot but this movie,0.024488736
I'm go ahead and talk about just like I normally would any other review i'll,0.02776676
go on the dynamics of the visual immersion the soundtrack the acting as well as,0.027699577
the story but the story i'm way I'm winner revealed I'm not going to say,0.028276958
anything about it i'm just going to talk about plot points so visual effects of,0.026832843
this like the cinematography um it was excellently shot they didn't use a lot of,0.078761734
trickery as far as like me haven't seen anything quite like this it was with,0.03453168
me he was really normally shot but it was like for every single moment or,0.12764741
significant thing that was happening i think the most impactful things when did characters such,0.024018452
as Rachel McAdams or Mark Ruffalo are interviewing specific people that supposedly were going through,0.03931036
the less station situations when you see it and actually here it is so eloquently,0.019221148
done because it focuses on the performance and they give how do I put it,0.023281427
they give so much more credit to the non big-name quote-unquote actors to be able,0.022656156
to tell this story it's almost as though the non actress they feel real they,0.03119046
feel really authentic the way that the cinematography is taken and checking from their perspective,0.01758679
every small scene where you see somebody that is a victim of this situation that,0.09252106
happened or it's been happening over at certain X amount of years because the movie,0.02459716
starts off in the very beginning i think it was around like 1976 or something,0.055660572
like that where something had just happened I ministation I guess case it just opened,0.0582947
up and it seemed really shady and really shoddy and then from that point the,0.1113564
score goes and the score y'all like it's done so well it's the undercurrent of,0.04204027
it because it's really smoothly paste I don't know who did the score for it,0.020322692
but it did an amazing job with it I actually really enjoyed because I think,0.032309964
it it helps with the weight of it when there's moments of silence there are,0.027806671
moments of silent when there's moments key moments when things are just kind of pacing,0.02260427
along where they're kind of going and trying to uncover this case or just part,0.031140571
of the situation this is paced really well as up-tempo via the same that time,0.041918542
it's not too flashy it's just right and it's all aspired to cinematography as far,0.02771022
as the score is concerned I mean the cinematography was nothing I haven't seen before,0.027775409
but for the key moments that are significant they are done and executed well and,0.09091929
they allow the actors to be as ok that's just their skills but their dedication,0.035725683
to the roles and the craft for what the whole plot about this movie is,0.020001408
we're talking into pretty soon I mean there was a point where Mark Ruffalo's character,0.040759794
is kind of arguing with um Michael Keaton's character and like it's so deep it's,0.01802049
so impact because the weight of everything has already hit you as a viewer but,0.14620736
when it focuses on like everything he's kind of already gone through to the point,0.027719533
of like him arguing I able to lose the perfect kind of scene and it,0.06528512
added really good tension but one of the things I was saying this is going,0.039723437
to segue into the acting of this the the actors that to me are stealing,0.08170916
the show are the victims like I said like there are moments where I'm sitting,0.03311617
there listening to these cases and they are very explicit I see why this movie,0.027785387
I think it's written arm or listen should be because they go into some heavy,0.24409416
deep stuff this movie is about two hours and eight minutes long but it's not,0.027065657
too long because you want to see the completion of the store when I was,0.032200877
looking at black master moments why I was kind of feel like man this is,0.21200468
too much too over-the-top at times but I mean it might be the true story,0.016352875
you know but this story as a weight like when you hear in like the,0.02838272
actors talk about their molestation situation or they're after effects are the remnants of their,0.18922745
life or even people that have covered up stuff like you see it all over,0.052400507
the faces in their performance and they do an amazing job but the thing that,0.018301198
I have to say as well is that my ruffalo michael keaton a trick adams,0.051817805
when they're doing the interviews they do a good job of trying to cover up,0.026163002
what their internally hearing they only towards the mid and the after acts show how,0.01899831
that how they've been uncovering all this information processing everything that has happened has affected,0.02017369
them because when they're doing the interview stuff like that there are really professional they're,0.026313335
listening and doing this they're attentive but it's like everything that happened really had an,0.023837522
effect on them not just from their mental state or emotional state from their spiritual,0.134113
perspective what they believe like is really intriguing to see like man it felt like,0.03082727
this was real and I mean everybody plays their road to a tee I dare,0.068177335
moments while I'm thinking man somebody's lying like somebody's covered this part up I think,0.12792546
that specifically market keeps character like in the beginning like I'm like okay he you,0.030503327
know he's doing all he can to you know do this right but who actually,0.028000241
in my opinion actually really still just always leave us motor because this character um,0.031751875
Marty Baron is like I guess this new New York Times best then listen came,0.030127497
from Florida and did that and now he's coming in the first case he wants,0.039601043
to do is open up about why this has not been investigated and like he,0.039288405
is so funny because his character is like so monotone and so off-putting like he,0.06165587
doesn't play golf he doesn't really get along with other people he's not there for,0.011560227
the prestige like he's there for a mission but it's like the way that he,0.03277493
talks and articulates his words he is the chain like he is literally the chain,0.035098415
that's driving this and is holding on to these characters and he works with them,0.020183668
so well as a team because he's pushing them but at the same time he's,0.056287173
going through it with them you see he'll put just as much work in as,0.03226739
each and every single one of them through the the process of them trying to,0.026695816
figure out what has really happened and I've gone to that into the segue into,0.06950105
the plot but I have to give him honorable mention because if he didn't play,0.02070517
the role like he did and wouldn't have add as much weight because I was,0.029172959
kind of like he's really off quitting like I'm sneaking that Michael Keaton was going,0.0940277
to be that that character but he was you know even though my kids character,0.016284361
significant his was even more so and he did an amazing job with he did,0.025545048
an amazing job even like job slavery playing the role of uh Ben I liked,0.15151021
his character because I couldn't figure him out I was like I don't know this,0.062327042
guy like who's somebody is lying you know and I was kind of feeling that,0.045489248
that's good storytelling that's good right in scripting storytelling so going into the plot I'm,0.02537609
not going to reveal to y'all what happens if you want to read into it,0.03391838
look up the story is on IMDb it'll go and give you to a web,0.045712084
link maybe Wikipedia or something like that but it's some heavy stuff because it's the,0.049198978
process that the Catholic Church has supposedly covered up your numerous amounts of child molestation,0.52289295
cases and that they're trying to unravel in figure them out and figuring out how,0.0307388
big a scope it is you know and I mean everybody's kind of coming with,0.059942357
repel if you look at the movie doubt for instance was that Meryl Streep and,0.03228136
philip seymour hoffman that was an amazing movie i was really dwell done it was,0.08621312
really sharp but it was all putting because you didn't know these are proven documented,0.020051962
facts that are just putting your face and like you're going through and you're like,0.16703759
man that's heavy I I don't know if I want to hear this you know,0.09124391
if it is it you don't have a choice you have to sit there and,0.025962783
take it and to take it into the fact that this is only in 2001,0.037893515
so how much more situation that happened in 2015 I remember when the case came,0.014143799
up using years ago and like to hear it it was like I was reliving,0.03058847
it you know and I mean I guess I guess that's the point of the,0.018120268
movie like it's a situation that is true that it has happened and the effect,0.019606953
of it I think is even more much weightier than the fact of that this,0.03112993
did happen because I'm looking at the effects this happened on these these actors of,0.106402114
these characters and it's like it's sad it is so seriously sad man like I,0.078854196
was in there like i'ma believe you're not believing God you know and I asked,0.08778296
that's basically what this other video I'm going to do I'm going to do a,0.041332517
full spiritual perspective on the weight of how this movie made me feel um and,0.028498463
I'm gonna add that to my second channel i'll leave that in description bar below,0.037999947
so y'all can be able to go to that y'all want to hear my perspective,0.026663221
on that being I am a Christian um it's going to be interesting to say,0.079059735
that it's gonna be really hard for me I should go through that but as,0.041831404
a movie reviewer as a story it was on point hit on every single target,0.06353967
like I said there wasn't anything big as far as seven targets if I can't,0.046746448
say that it revolutionizes anything but it was shot perfectly it was scored perfectly they,0.06218336
had a great cast the sub characters the sub caste which I don't even want,0.05830534
to go through a name they all did an amazing night they were all believable,0.027156787
you know and even towards the very end it was just like wow like you,0.109133355
you will you will feel that weight of this movie in I highly recommend you,0.118796475
go and check this out as soon as the hist animals this weekend I was,0.05744925
blessed to be able to get an early screening of it and I should I'm,0.029178945
probably gonna try to see it again it was really well done I'm botched come,0.0789746
down blu-ray um but yeah again this is not for kids this is it are,0.038208812
it's a lot to it but hopefully you enjoyed my full review for the movie,0.03600506
spotlight and yeah I might head to this other thing this is going to be,0.080243096
even more harder to do French for me off either way keep a lot SEL,0.08676256
