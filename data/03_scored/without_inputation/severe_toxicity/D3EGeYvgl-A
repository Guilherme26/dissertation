today's a rare day when you can celebrate a movie's 100th anniversary because the cabinet,0.019969478
of dr. Caligari was released exactly a hundred years ago today not only that but,0.021674344
from a certain point of view you can also say the entire horror film genre,0.035868034
also turns a hundred today sure there existed many older films that could be considered,0.022117356
horror mostly short films including many by Georges méliès who was the Godfather of special-effects,0.094690226
and introducing fantasy elements to motion pictures and Thomas Edison produced a Frankenstein film in,0.026400473
1910 there also existed many adaptations of Jekyll and Hyde back then but Caligari was,0.016819168
the first where all the elements that we know in horror films came together it's,0.04585776
strange that the old VHS tapes always said the movie came out in 1919 and,0.07302053
that seemed to be the common accepted date for a while but now it seems,0.02133909
that's been corrected it was filmed in late 1919 but premiered in Germany on February,0.032134358
26th 1920 so we didn't miss it it's one of my favorite silent films and,0.030669622
the reason why is because of its visual style that uses elements of German Expressionism,0.074148685
an art movement in the early 20th century where the artist would distort reality to,0.020853506
emphasize their subjective view and emotions as soon as we enter its world we see,0.023095176
a painted landscape of a town on a hill where all the rooftops are leaning,0.022408707
like grass being blown in the wind the town streets have angular splashes of light,0.080326915

have painted shadows creating odd shapes light and shadow are always painted on the walls,0.010981517
things bend at weird angles windows are anything but square sometimes they seem to explicitly,0.056379635
point at something to draw your focus to the most important part of the frame,0.011648696
contrasting stripes of light and shadow extend from its central points the characters themselves even,0.015063084
act like they belong to this twisted environment look at how he moved so unnaturally,0.08064553
guiding himself along the weird scenery and then as he extends his arms mimicking the,0.08221803
tree branches and when you sit down long enough and just give yourself to this,0.10360568
movie it puts you in a trance like you're going into a dream world films,0.13537551
were invented as a visual medium but until then most filmmakers would just film the,0.033011068
real world but then thanks to movies like Caligari they were utilizing film to show,0.025665445
us a fantasy world and escape from reality it's also an early example of a,0.02865212
framing story because it begins with our main character francis sitting on a bench with,0.022372786
another man about to tell him a story you know kind of like Forrest Gump,0.040069997
and that story he tells is the main movie here Francis recalls hanging out with,0.032406416
his friend Alan and their mutual friend Jane who they're competing for romantically but without,0.011036062
drama they go to a carnival where they see an act by a magician named,0.04388882
Calgary who opens a coffin shaped box to reveal a sleepwalker named Caesar or Sasori,0.12307494
I'll just say c-czar I guess because it's a little shorter these are answers questions,0.03684519
from the audience Alan asks how long he has to live and sees or tells,0.019427354
him he won't even make it to dawn and it just so happens that very,0.041826084
night someone comes into his bedroom and stabs him to death even though they only,0.6100281
imply the stabbing with a shadow it's still a pretty gruesome idea for 1920 this,0.4312966
predates the famous psycho shower scene stabbing by for decades and since this movie has,0.3093259
a body count you can call it a proto slasher film in the morning Francis,0.030872503
and Jane are horrified suspecting Caesar they go the police who begin an investigation the,0.057938825
police end up arresting a random man who is caught trying to murder someone but,0.25415707
is unrelated to the person who murdered Alan Jane visits Caligari alone he invites her,0.17057171
to take a close look at c-czar she gets frightened and runs off and he,0.12729686
seems to take joy in it and now it also seems she's been marked for,0.037683982
murder Francis snoops about peering through a window keeping a watchful eye on Caligari and,0.29399237
see SAR while they sleep but somehow CSR is in two places at once as,0.023083203
he emerges outside Jane's win what a creepy shot I love how he pulls the,0.15638268
window off and then slowly creeps into the room there's something real fascinating seeing that,0.07288351
dark slim body moving so slowly toward her bed very deliberate and theatrical he raises,0.24199326
the knife to kill her but when he looks at her again up close he,0.6350205
hesitates as if he has some kind of feelings for her he lowers the knife,0.29159215
he goes to touch her but then she wakes up screams and then he grabs,0.25111657
her and this right here is probably the most disturbing shot of the whole movie,0.113429114
he carries her off up onto misshapen rooftops and across crooked bridges as an angry,0.11712287
mob chases after him until he seems to come out of his spell collapses and,0.18067852
dies the police search Caligari again and find the Caesar who's been sleeping in the,0.2657664
box as of lately he's just a dummy Caligari runs away and Frances follows him,0.2323166
all the way to an insane asylum he walks in and asked to see the,0.13682495
director of the asylum only to find the director his Caligari while he sleeps he,0.06684896
investigates the director's office with the cooperation of the asylum staff they find the director's,0.034709282
journals and when they read them it goes into a flashback and since the whole,0.0424008
movie is a flashback it's technically a flashback within a flashback which is pretty crazy,0.21393038
for early silent cinema here we learn the director was obsessed with an ancient mystic,0.028502453
named Caligari who used a sleepwalker to commit murders so he experiments on his own,0.36513275
sleepwalker after the flashback ends the police come to the director's office bringing him Caesars,0.087267436
corpse he lashes out at them they restrained him in a straitjacket and lock him,0.56706744
up in his own asylum then we come out of the main flashback and we're,0.073784165
back to Francis on the bench like we saw in the beginning and I will,0.028672077
say spoiler alert but you may have already seen it coming and the movie is,0.01264381
a century old but it turns out now all along the bench is located at,0.028499793
that very same Asylum and Francis himself is a patient inside we see a group,0.04754999
of characters who are each suffering from different delusions and all them resemble characters from,0.037856933
Francis's story the director walks in who now only resembles Caligari but is not explicitly,0.014340694
the same guy francis flips out screaming that he's Caligari and it seems now that,0.07743336
francis was completely insane all along they put him in the straitjacket and lock him,0.3114112
in the exact same cell from his story then the director says he now understands,0.029205553
his delusion and knows how to cure him but right before the iris closes on,0.07893867
his face it lingers why does it linger is he Caligari or is he not,0.08428209
that's the question it leaves you with a plot twist like this must have been,0.029192915
a pretty big deal back in 1920 you don't often see movies in the silent,0.029352559
era that have something this complex and the fact the character telling the story is,0.013610323
a patient in an asylum it makes you question whether anything you saw was real,0.048609626
it's a completely subjective movie that adheres to no set facts you make up whatever,0.022213807
you want and that's of course why the visuals are so surreal it's meant to,0.022249728
be the world of a madman and that visual world has become the look of,0.23148136
gothic horror films I mean early in the sound era with Frankenstein 1931 you can,0.07226887
see all the traces of Caligari on full display the shadowy staircase the slanted walls,0.03233258
the oddly shaped windows the bedroom scene where the monster sneaks in through the window,0.1340079
to attack Frankenstein's wife it's all there it's also apparent in murders of the Rue,0.2940269
Morgue from 1932 we can see all the buildings and rooftops are slanted at strange,0.030817293
angles it's very common now that type of architecture has almost become standard in a,0.027300468
whole genre of films mainly the world of Tim Burton it seems almost everything Tim,0.04111101
Burton has ever made is in some way inspired by Caligari also the classic theme,0.046566848
of Beauty and the Beast is there the monster falls in love with a girl,0.2779495
and carries her off to the rooftops we see that happen and murders in the,0.2132918
Rue Morgue but this time it's an ape carrying her up the roof and then,0.2446074
only a year after that in 1933 we have an even bigger ape carrying the,0.2867204
girl up onto an even bigger building yes I just drew links from Caligari tumours,0.23395252
the Rue Morgue to King Kong but you know that's only the beginning because then,0.038647834
we trace it to Creature from the Black Lagoon and from that point it's so,0.09695251
common it doesn't even matter it's the classic cliche it's the monster falls in love,0.109094106
with the girl and that becomes his downfall it's Beauty and the Beast it's even,0.26116204
older than Caligari then there's the theme of the mad doctor or villain taking control,0.037976664
of a monster it's been recycled countless times throughout horror movies even the common idea,0.1633997
is there of just being a main villain who's the mastermind and then the obedient,0.10910475
henchman who carries out his plans it's the brain and the brawn it's the standard,0.18218715
superhero cliche and the idea of an evil hypnotist or someone who controls or persuades,0.12226208
the thoughts of common people is opening a whole can of worms the film was,0.06505696
made in Germany between World War 1 and World War 2 and its political aspects,0.07029195
have been analyzed and discussed in detail Caligari is the representation of the authority or,0.010693492
dictator and caesar is the brainwashed person who's forced into following a tyrant and on,0.47002885
that note I want to direct your attention to one scene one tiny little detail,0.07703359
right before Allan a staff there's a brief shot of his hands it's a very,0.1842745
weird edit because it flashes by so quick and doesn't really match the continuity of,0.016181923
the other shots for some reason that shot always lingered in my mind and I,0.20359676
wonder I just wonder if in 1928 the political artist John Hartfield saw and remembered,0.011593486
that image when he designed the poster called five fingers has the hand which was,0.030672284
meant to oppose the Nazi Party then in 1998 System of a Down used it,0.1366194
for their cover of their debut album I just make a link from Caligari to,0.013188596
System of a Down possibly since this movie is so old and everyone in it,0.08375793
is long dead we may never know all the details of what it meant and,0.058000688
how it was made I find that adds to the appeal that with silent movies,0.042982172
like this there is a little sense of mystery that goes along with its antiquity,0.05154109
personally I'm so fascinated with those sets I've always wondered is there any possible way,0.021557936
a single piece of any of them has survived probably not and when a movie,0.031235028
almost has no tangible evidence other than the film itself it kind of becomes unreal,0.035870694
in a way like it truly exists in a dream it's most notable actor conrad,0.049204964
veidt had been the star of the man who laughs which was the inspiration for,0.0676106
the Joker he had a career which lasted into the sound era he was in,0.05119453
the sound version of The Thief of Bagdad playing the main villain jaffer when the,0.18144414
story was adapted into the Disney animated film Jaffer became Jafar so if having been,0.016797217
the basis of a famous comic book villain and a Disney villain wasn't enough he,0.11495039
was also the villain in Casablanca which just might be the most critically acclaimed film,0.03998818
of all time if you haven't seen Caligari now's a better time than ever because,0.017328033
nowadays you can see it in high-def clarity when I first saw it in the,0.023807587
early 90s it was on a crappy VHS tape that was when the film was,0.25418976
in the public domain for a while and any low-rent distributor could release it the,0.026464332
copies always looked fuzzy I couldn't tell what was going on with the set design,0.0269712
looking back that kind of made it more interesting because as the movie kept getting,0.039392177
re-released it kept looking better and better so it was like being able to see,0.01738657
more and more of the movie as time went on silent films are interesting because,0.021815363
back then when they transfer them to video they didn't always project them at the,0.029745016
proper speed so the characters moved very rapidly and the movie flew by at only,0.02368719
50 minutes I think at the proper speed Caligari is like one hour 20 minutes,0.06508423
but that used to confuse me I always wondered why is the movie so much,0.022557043
longer are there scenes that were restored but no it's just a different speed and,0.011196371
by watching it slower it definitely gives a different feel you could say it drags,0.019043542
a little at the longer speed or that it helps put you into that hypnotic,0.02652553
mood the title cards are different to the versions I saw was in English texts,0.014838251
real plain and simple but the newest releases have restored the original German titles which,0.09383879
were written in an expressionist style which is real cool but of course if you,0.06447359
only know English then you're reading subtitles over the titles also depending which version you,0.020933995
see you could hear a different sound track because with silent movies there's obviously no,0.022163918
sound so all those different VHS releases would use whatever stock music they had now,0.06337138
with official blu-ray releases they tend to go back to the original sheet music and,0.07823957
recreate what the orchestra would play in the old theater palaces so depending on the,0.024741506
music you hear or what speed it's projected I mean they could totally change your,0.03753299
impression of the film and it really depends on your mindset what type of mood,0.018985672
you're in when you watch it I say put it on at night at some,0.07219371
dark quiet hour and just drift off into the surreal world of the cabinet of,0.09181996
