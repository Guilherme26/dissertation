call him him what does that mean on the site just got in from seeing the Wonder Woman movie let me give a quick shout-out to the man who sang that I ran into that was running the concession stand what's happening man he asked me what I thought after the movie I said once my overview he's like alright so the whole premise of the movie is you know Trevor said his name there's a Steve I can't remember a way it's no ruin all feminists Keira eyelid I think we've seen this in the trailer she finds him resuscitates him but he resuscitates himself basically the amazons find out from him that there is a war going on and now Diana wants to help stop the war she believes that Ares is the cause of this war if she's heard of a special weapon on them as scare and she wants to take this women weapon and she wants to slay Ares to stop this war and to stop all these millions of people from dying around the planet and then we have our story I would like to say that as far as this movie goes I thought that all the actors were good I thought that all the actors were good I did I didn't have a problem the acting whatsoever and I thought a gal gadot did a great job as being one whine the banter between her and Trevor Steve found the lie and keep mixing up the names but I think it's Trevor could be Steve I think is Trevor for all you [ __ ] psychos out there they're like oh the name of the guy wrong [ __ ] you okay so what oh so I thought of acting was fine I thought Gallagher and I did a great job the banter between them too was good during the movie there was a lot of I'm not of your world what is this type of jokes what does that mean type of jokes you know for stepping my bounds as a woman the only things that'll want to doesn't do in your world a lot of those jokes in there visually it looked very similar to a Zack Snyder movies to color grading and the grit and just the way everything looked looked like something similar to his Boonton his you know movies okay I know it wasn't directed by him but you could see that they were made trying to make everything seamless in between these movies that are in the Snyder verse they all have a particular look his look and I could see that I would say that the movie was slow-moving the first half but not boring that makes sense you slow but not boring ah the action was good when it was getting good one thing in particular I had a homosexual couple that was sitting to my left right next to me and they one of them in particular made it very hard need to concentrate on particular action sequences because when the action sequences got on particularly the first major action sequence it's in the trailer which breaks the gun and all that stuff this dude was killing me I'm kidding you're trying it really goodness he's okay kept doing it was just driving me nuts but wet so anyway um our action sequences were good um movie was longer than I thought was going to be certain people died I anything with us docking and uh I would say that she was wonder what throughout the movie she was she was funny she was sexy she was strong she was powerful she was fast she was basically everything that I wanted her to be so I can say that I'm very happy with the Wonder Woman character pretty much in how they portrayed her the movie has comedic moments a little campy sometimes but it had its moments had action pretty much a lot of what I was looking for you know there's like an X Factor did they tell you make someone great what is it X Factor here down that is keeping me from absolutely loving this movie I'm not sure exactly what it was I don't know if it was the pacing or I told you it was slow but not boring like I don't love it but I don't hate the movie either I'm ok with it that's how I feel you know I'm going to give it three out of five wolves and uh this is going to be mullet style so let's start talking mullet which means spoilers ok review in the front spoiler zooming back that's my mother's style I ain't expectin the dude to die I expect that but then again it was all those years ago she's a god so okay well that rep set up next to me known as Han um Ares was Magneto don't tell me he wasn't he was magneto magneto okay a funny-looking type of magneto because he said you know Scotland Yard bushy mustache like it's like he totally threw me off and way this was the God of War the Lord the God of War looks like um she did fly a little bit her Nerys did their little levitation thing I think if we saw her levitate like twice especially when she rained down and you know took his power and send it back to him she was she was in there floating levitating that flight as far as I'm concerned and at the end she was flying I'm sorry that was flight that wasn't a Hulka jump anywhere she's flying wherever she wanted to go uh y'all can argue with me all you want I don't give a [ __ ] you know I'd oh so I guess the true test will be when Justice League comes along we see her fly in Justice League then we noticed she's able to fly we know that's how she dropped in front of Batman that's how she dropped it from him she flew there I don't care she flies on planes when she's doing business she used her superpowers to get over there and she flew okay oh I did like just I did like that first scene I like that first scene where she got into the war the first part was a little extra theatrical I mean when she stepped up the ladder zpn and pin and the gay dude messed it up for me again about oh well you just can't do hopefully man you are [ __ ] killing this for me so I guess he's a diva watching addy but so he was happy so um I'm watching this and you know she's gonna do peeling Peru now was it - personally I just normally was over the top for me over-the-top theatrics you know whatever you may think of what I like I don't care because it's like there's certain things that work for me and certain things I don't some of you will hear me give a review on something they label you didn't like this but you like this that has nothing to do with this he's even I'm saying so I'm talking about Wonder Woman right now and certain things in their context and how they were done in other movies we ain't talking about that with this movie and yeah I know some of y'all do that with certain things and you know you don't get it you know think properly you just relate one thing the other a little superhero sir if you like this that means you have to like this that's not well how how life works that's not how my minds work anyway so once she started getting on the field and she had the shield and everything that was a cool sequence you know in Trevor or Steve Trevor got on there with his mentor took out the Germans and then when she got in there and she started [ __ ] all them soldiers up that was very very reminiscent of the warehouse scene with Batman very I live really did that was that was her that was her Batman warehouse scene lonely you know ones and um as far as the crowd I'm going to talk about the crowd I would like to say other than the gay dudes next to me go low whoo I didn't hear anything throughout the movie I didn't hear any cheers I personally didn't cheer myself until be it I think everyone was happy with the product and with the movie and you know they were like damn at least you made it you know yeah I think everybody you know yeah but I gotta say when I'm thinking of the movies where you know I'm thinking of the vvvv DC universe movies that I've seen start from Man of Steel I don't remember hearing any cheering in Man of Steel until the end also although I was chairing doornail I thought I was doing my crazy maniacal laughter whoo certain things I was watching I was grinning ear-to-ear watching a lot of that and then um that may be Superman I remember three times specifically people cheering during the whole Batman V Superman fight the the Batman warehouse fight and when when Wonder Woman showed the [ __ ] up and at the end and at the end sorry so four times I remember the crowd cheering during that movie okay Wonder Woman it wasn't till the end and Suicide Squad none there's no cheering at all I ain't hear any cheers at all so I'm now it depends on where you go you know certain places you go people and give a [ __ ] you know and all that so you know I understand in my area I'm telling you my movie going experience okay if I had to rate all the movies together I'm going to go with all the the the the DC Cinematic Universe movies not counting Green Lantern of course I'm going to go with Batman V Superman first for me um then man is steel and then Wonder Woman and then Suicide Squad so those all the three of those are my top three I enjoyed watching all three uh but um you know it's you know the I told you I just did not like Suicide Squad at all Wonder Woman it gets a pass for me if I really great it would be a see you know it's just something about it it wasn't great to me but I thought it was still a good job but I'm not I'm not exactly calling it average maybe I will call it a C+ you know what I mean I'm not I liked a lot of it but some of it I sat like this fool out of the movie I did they were just certain disconnects that didn't exactly work from me but I was still pleased with the product I was still pleased with it but I wasn't overly happy like I was you know um you know with like a remaining steel and then when especially Batman V Superman I was very pleased very pleased but uh I don't know I just I think they did a good job making our Wonder Woman for today and I'm happy and I can't wait to see her and the Justice League and mr. Snyder please put the rest whether she can fly it not okay I don't care what who said in an interview or not okay because we know they did movie makers and actors be [ __ ] with us in interviews and then eventually stuff Adams in the movies in like wait a minute I thought you said so um she was lying on to me levitation is flight okay far as I'm concerned levitation is flight okay like [ __ ] you floating for alright and at the end it was no slow motion jump that was a slow motion jump to flight okay she was flying goddamnit okay so anyway post comments down below let me know what you all thought if you enjoyed my review hit like button subscribe and share of course if you did not you can kiss my black wonder 111 there yeah ten million subscribers whoo you may now subscribe
