the farewell is written and directed by Lulu Wang and stars aquafina as Billy a,0.048313614
girl living in New York that's with her parents but away from her parents she's,0.15250388
struggling she's kind of a disappointment she hasn't really met the expectations that her parents,0.15040626
have set for her she has a really close relationship with her grandmother living in,0.47501966
China however but then she finds out from her parents that her grandmother does have,0.15927467
cancer and they have yet to tell the grandmother either she only has about three,0.3463075
months to live and they're kind of holding it back so she doesn't have to,0.115819976
live with the stress of dying and the farewell was actually really well done I,0.13560006
was very pleased with this trip to the movie theater I was very surprised I,0.091831125
did not watch a trailer for this I heard this premiered at Sundance and I,0.11384913
think it did pretty well I'm not exactly sure it has a 90% on Rotten,0.31089434
Tomatoes and I actually do think it deserves that rating I don't know about 99%,0.15216152
there are some flaws of this film but I think this film is overall really,0.0689521
well done first off I just want to applaud Lulu Wang and her writing in,0.0670685
this film because she is tasked with a really tough job of dealing with comedy,0.2046587
along with very dramatic beats especially like dealing with cancer like that's tough this is,0.16600744
her story so she did live this this is an actual true story she does,0.08481883
do a really good job telling it and it is a very personal project but,0.026263304
you can tell that she really knows how to work that comedy and drama together,0.24109983
she'll start out with a joke it more towards the beginning of the film and,0.11779099
then like later on about halfway through the film she'll call back to that joke,0.12701401
where you thought that first joke was just like a throwaway line and easy laughing,0.10668177
in the theater but then it plays into the dramatic plot and it makes it,0.07247991
very enriching and it just has a better punch line it almost makes the humor,0.17572129
funnier because it's dark and you shouldn't be laughing at this point but it's good,0.17286819
and it just seems very realistic what characters would actually do and I think that's,0.027761104
the biggest part of this film that I just feel like these are real characters,0.06752902
they really feel like they've lived in this world and this leads to awkwafina where,0.08942712
I haven't seen much of her but what I've seen is very comedic supporting roles,0.14032455
so really not a ton she's really funny but she hasn't really been able to,0.15223157
flex the acting jobs and in this film she does that and more she knocks,0.090418495
it out of the park she is a brilliant actress and I really hope to,0.11357291
see her and more 8:24 you know independent genre type films like this I think,0.19559461
she'll do a really good job and I really look forward to seeing her she,0.110942215
really just hits the dramatic beats you can really feel the divide in herself thinking,0.17148535
whether or not to tell her grandma would be better or just letting her grandma,0.31089434
die happy and you really identify with her and she does like I said she,0.5691129
does a really good job i I really would like to see her be recognized,0.09982578
by the Academy later this year or early next year whatever but anyways Lulu Wang,0.052497424
she does a really good job directing as well she gets a really good performance,0.17216937
out of Aquafina but also the entire cast is a plus caliber here she does,0.20510384
a really good job getting those performances and the entire cast deserves a lot of,0.09900288
credit here they are going full force and it's an entire Chinese cast that's like,0.09840929
I think that's really cool I also think that grandma was hilarious in this film,0.17844833
she actually was almost identical in the way she acts and I thought it was,0.062292762
really funny and I really connected to that part because she's always like hitting and,0.3744484
smacking you calling you stupid but in a very loving manner and I really enjoyed,0.8355208
that it was very it was a good way to connect to the film not,0.061254
to mention the cinematography and sound design and score was just amazing I think this,0.058673356
is a beautiful film I think beautifully shot film let's be clear there it is,0.17375508
a beautiful film as well but the score was really good as well I it,0.06350799
really stood out to me they use a lot of piano and strings and it,0.10144716
almost reminded me of the favorite just last year which is I think another 8:24,0.052723434
film could be wrong but Billy's characters he played the piano but she doesn't anymore,0.10786873
and I there's something there when the piano is playing and it just really transforms,0.05080374
you into the mindset that she's going through and just enhances her performance even more,0.20849442
and I just think top to bottom this film is really great and it's very,0.15039925
well constructed however there are a few things that stood out to me that I,0.07751687
didn't like so much like I said there is a cancer subplot and I feel,0.31089434
like this film structurally is familiar and I it's a nitpick there's just a few,0.07177104
things like you know with her struggling with money and stuff like that it's just,0.118844084
kind of like it seems a bit of a cliche when it comes to movies,0.11749047
like this you know or dramas in general that and the third act is a,0.069622934
little it's paced a little slowly there are a lot of just hanging out giving,0.24770999
speeches and drinking that just doesn't seem necessarily you know completely necessary but at the,0.033243246
end of the day with the farewell having you know slight mishaps towards the end,0.08795185
of the film I think it was really great I really connected to a lot,0.056204945
of these characters they're very compelling they have really tough things they're going through and,0.07018874
decisions they have to make I think it's a very beautiful film I think it's,0.10231657
touching and if I had to choose one word to describe the farewell I would,0.10128931
say it's emotional but in the good way but what did you think of the,0.045138445
