oh wow big thumbs up to the movie Selma the emotion in this movie is off the chart it's a retelling of the pivotal time in the civil rights movement and suffered for black Americans and the role MLK played in it while the movie easily could have turned into a dry biography of Martin Luther King the producers expertly present the events in this movie with the level of intensity power all that captivates the movie of yours the slow motion effects using the most violent scenes make the movie even more resident david oi LOL was MLK who's also British if you didn't know does an incredible job he embodies MLK spirit and delivers true power just like the rail out okay in each and every one of his speeches my soul complete in this movie was that the ending was slightly anti-climatic I was expecting a strong and emotional ending and we just didn't get it overall despite the lackluster ending this movie was a fantastic production with great picture directing and flawless acting I highly suggested you
