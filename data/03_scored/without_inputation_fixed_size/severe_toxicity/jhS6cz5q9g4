O'Connor Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen is a 1952 musical that follows the career of,0.02352555
Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown to lifelong friends that go into the movie business during,0.029907322
the silent age of Hollywood but now during the advent of sound pictures they must,0.010056912
adapt or die all the while being dragged down by Lina Lamont a silent aged,0.3795931
film star with a terrible voice who threatens to ruin all of their careers singing,0.2786451
in the rain is one of those movies that I hadn't seen yet even though,0.015725607
it's always at the top of the greatest musicals ever made lists and all these,0.023556149
other things and you hear about it all the time I just hadn't seen it,0.017737787
because frankly while I enjoy current-day style musicals where the songs are a key part,0.03739064
of the storytelling old musicals old Hollywood musicals tend to just have these musical numbers,0.02950688
that come out of nowhere mean nothing take forever and while they might be visually,0.11370583
interesting have cool choreography they're pointless and so they feel annoying and and like a,0.28649572
huge waste of time after watching this movie the one thing that is abundantly clear,0.052997176
is the fact that this movie is carried almost entirely by the actors the actors,0.030356986
are the heart and soul of this movie Gene Kelly does an amazing job as,0.023946611
this hyper popular really famous film star who is in all the big movies and,0.041764885
he just has this charm about him in every scene whether he's pretending to be,0.046593454
acting or whether he's just talking to people or he's feeling down it doesn't matter,0.046148445
what the scenario is he is so charming and so instantly likeable and lovable it's,0.118868984
just incredible his performance Donald O'Connor is interesting too because he plays the best friend,0.026341273
of Gene Kelly and he is really a supporting role he doesn't have much of,0.026094489
an arc he doesn't have a whole lot to offer in terms of the story,0.025088731
but in terms of what he brings to the film is a lot I mean,0.016725378
he brings this hyper amazing energy like every scene he is in he elevates it,0.06791991
by a lot I mean he is so charismatic and so energetic and so excited,0.08901155
to be part of every scene he's in Debbie Reynolds is our main female lead,0.10851008
in the movie does a really great job whenever I see a female character in,0.037944734
a movie from the 50s or earlier I always have to really reset my expectations,0.021218693
for what characters are gonna be like because back then a lot of female characters,0.06331684
were just cardboard cutouts but in this movie we get a sense of her wants,0.06555784
desires her frustrations you know she feels like a more well-rounded character than I honestly,0.089127295
would have expected for the time period so it's surprising and she does a really,0.0205728
good job with her character she sings amazing her physicality in terms of the way,0.061629266
she moves and dances and stuff is amazing as well she just does a really,0.03573433
really good job and she is just pitch perfect for the part and then Jean,0.074129395
Hagen who plays our de-facto villain in the movie who is this over pampered starlet,0.13732783
who gets everything she wants and is hyper demanding she has this hyper screechy awkward,0.15286851
accent / voice and the entire plot of the movie is about how awful her,0.15878199
voice is that's the entire plot of the movie and so if that didn't work,0.030341022
though movie would have fallen apart and it works beautifully because the first time I,0.039553814
was watching the movie and I saw her talk for the first time it correctly,0.047194116
made me go ah your voice is terrible so when the whole plot revolves around,0.15140843
everyone trying to hide her voice from the public so they don't find out how,0.041991714
terrible her voice is as an actress it you buy it all the way as,0.40852556
a musical we of course have to talk about some of the musical numbers oh,0.009060467
man the physicality on display by the actors here and the dancers here is in,0.053600498
sane this is some of the most impressive dancing I've ever seen in a movie,0.02995588
ever choreography is ridiculous and the execution of that choreography is even more ridiculous these,0.57714516
are these are incredibly long takes of really complicated movements with multiple characters interacting with,0.05784969
each other and strict timing I mean it's just unbelievable every scene is so complicated,0.056633737
and they're all executed with such precision it's it's a wonder to behold I think,0.30128923
by far my favorite musical number was good morning which was a trio number with,0.024518669
Gene Kelly Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and they are all doing these complicated movements,0.056283183
they're dancing together they're arm and arm they're like dancing upstairs and downstairs and using,0.05739271
props left and right and just oh it's crazy and it has so much character,0.102640495
to it and so well done like they're going from room to room it's um,0.041732293
it's unbelievable Donald O'Connor's big number is make him laugh which is this incredibly physical,0.14202867
dance number where he's flipping over props and he's like getting up and falling down,0.055048604
on the floor and you know he does it with so much energy and so,0.015742902
much character and he's flipping upside down over walls and like wow man Wow it's,0.06666005
unreal as I'm watching it I'm thinking okay he's he's got to stop like it's,0.115499824
gotta go down like he's got to start winding this down and it just keeps,0.14294131
ratcheting up to another level and going and going going and the energy is insane,0.097331
Broadway melody I have to mention because it's in the tail end of the movie,0.04393538
and I think and the tail end of the movie there's more musical numbers that,0.020442424
are more irrelevant they feel longer they feel more stretched out and while there's interesting,0.08082314
things happening in them it does feel a little overwrought but there's two parts of,0.05449783
the Broadway melody that are so interesting and so beautiful and cool that I have,0.021560598
to mention them there's this sexy dance between Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse where she's,0.16844445
wearing this green dress and she's dancing around him and they basically play out an,0.03909484
entire intimate relationship in a dance and like the power on display of the physicality,0.12547159
of both Gene Kelly and said Cherie says she's jumping into his arms and he's,0.13697529
lifting her up or dipping her flipping her around and it is really impressive just,0.07527152
the physicality of that dance and the sensuality of that dance is something else the,0.04519058
other part of the Broadway melody is the melody ballet which is just insane it's,0.08295971
this really long segment where Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse are dancing but Cyd Charisse,0.06226784
has this shawl this like white scarf thing that's just draping forever behind her it's,0.22937971
just it it's incredibly beautiful it's long takes these long long takes of them dancing,0.123585135
like this and it just looks so unwieldy and difficult to film that I can't,0.030946339
imagine how many takes it would have taken to get that right I mean wow,0.018228693
it was impressive it was just unbelievable i watch that and I think they would,0.04991139
never do that today like Dave if they were gonna do that scene they would,0.046868175
do this the entire shawl of CGI because they would not want to deal with,0.06714896
the headache of trying to get that to work practically but back then they didn't,0.010698149
have a choice and I mean to have the the khones to go for it,0.025740612
it's crazy it's crazy but the the results speak for themselves it's beautiful I mean,0.09207339
this movie is so fun like it's funny to like the comedy in this movie,0.055917997
is is real I was laughing out loud at a lot of the jokes the,0.02276458
character dynamics are so good and it's just this hyper real world the colors are,0.03139334
bright and lively and everybody in this world seems to be loving what they're doing,0.03242704
in life and and nobody seems down-and-out nowadays there's so many films that are so,0.04248129
cynical and so dark and but this just has a really refreshing beautiful air about,0.09311241
it my final rating for singing in the rain is going to be a 10,0.03889994
out of 10 there's really nothing to complain about the the musical numbers as they,0.022770567
are are really good the characters are great the story is simple but well-executed and,0.11519251
funny I mean this is just a great movie and I I think everyone should,0.05596057
