but Jen what gel Denise long time no see I'm Denise the pharmacist filmmaker today,0.027137497
I'm gonna be doing a review on the movie The Farewell so this was actually,0.06317249
if you've looked at my January 2020 Mandarin study plan if you haven't like go,0.03528666
check it out but if you looked at that and watch that you know that,0.024384301
one of my ways to motivate myself to continue speaking and learning Mandarin was I,0.053376995
was going to go to a screening of this movie that I had looked up,0.042370204
but called the farewell so it was screening at a university near me and I,0.030805985
was like cool you know I'll go check it out and I had found it,0.056361675
because I was looking up specifically like I googled Chinese movies near me and that,0.10271367
one came up and so at the time I knew it was supposed to be,0.027355012
a movie that was done in Mandarin and also in English about a grandmother who's,0.07968435
terminally ill and her family keeps it a secret from her so that's all I,0.4417331
know about the movie I thought it was a small movie that nobody knew about,0.06498445
like just a little film and then like so I was good I was going,0.035320587
to watch it a specific day like and within that two weeks like before I,0.022810478
was supposed to watch it the Golden Globes happen and I'm Aquafina one the best,0.033613726
aquafina is the lead actress in in the farewell she won Best Actress let me,0.022934867
look at my notes to get this right she won a Golden Globe for Best,0.01818612
Actress in a motion picture comedy or musical and she's the first woman of Asian,0.05190029
descent to win a Golden Globe as a lead actress in any category what like,0.036050957
it was a big deal this is a very big deal movie I thought it,0.036720134
was just like oh you know like something that has some Mandarin in it but,0.025622874
it was awesome and I did watch it and I enjoyed it so after I,0.041270655
found that out I was like oh that's cool so people are gonna be watching,0.04530167
this film now that it's won like an award and let's get into like why,0.045833815
are we still having firsts like why is she the first Asian actress to win,0.070260026
in a lead category we should be on like number 300 think it's 2020 let's,0.02001072
knock it off with the first like let's just you know evolve and let that,0.23118053
happen I don't like that in my day and age so we're still having first,0.040928084
stuff like people of color winning things and doing things like no no let's like,0.29930347
let's let's let's fast forward it but I'm very happy and I'm very proud of,0.019133342
her that's that's very awesome alright so let's get into it so it really was,0.032651205
what I thought it was that two-sentence description that I had read about the the,0.011852242
film it was exactly what it was so there's this grandma a9i who's awkwafina's grandma,0.07902515
and she's terminally ill her whole family's not gonna tell her because so like as,0.3597737
an American I'm hearing that and I don't speak for all Americans I'm just telling,0.06011597
you where my perspective is coming from as an American I hear that and I'm,0.04976638
like so doctors and people are gonna lie to you about your health that's disgusting,0.16157576
that's disrespectful that is infringing on your rights as a patient that is you know,0.06914783
messing up HIPPA laws where you have like the right to privacy of your information,0.020951955
and you know like it's everything should be between you and your doctor not like,0.22655724
your doctor tells the truth to your family and lies - you know I was,0.12743855
totally like judgmental about the entire premise of the film because I'm just like that's,0.023306705
not right nope nope nope and nope no I need to know if I'm dying,0.069451824
I want to know so that I can prepare anything I need to prepare you,0.13279726
know like fight for my life you know but in the movie basically one of,0.067291304
the characters explained that I think it was awkwafina's mom said it's not the cancer,0.07156178
that kills you it's the fear like from after you know you have the cancer,0.58701485
um whatever sort of cancer it is so if we don't tell you about the,0.10061035
cancer you won't have fear and you won't die she didn't say that part but,0.24018613
I guess that's the logic behind it she just said it's not the cancer that,0.050186776
kills you it's the fear and so I still didn't accept that because I was,0.5459008
like no it's disrespectful and that's that that's my American viewpoint period so it does,0.04944044
show her the movie that this is common practice for families to keep secrets the,0.045398783
specific secrets of people being terminally ill from the patient and then it seemed like,0.24270223
they can tell you like when you're like on your death but now they'll be,0.46963277
like oh by the way the reason you've been feeling horrible and now you're dying,0.19332099
is because you've been dying well here so it turns out though that 9'i the,0.08637742
grandma she did do the same thing to her husband so once I found that,0.06371395
I was like okay so now that like she was complicit in doing it to,0.10654579
him I guess that means she would be okay with them doing it to her,0.072263554
she would at least understand what they were trying to do and then her nice,0.033639003
sister does say that when he was like it the time was coming that she,0.045869067
did tell him and so night night sister said when the time really really comes,0.09913365
for a night night she will tell her own sister like hey you're dying how,0.27607813
would you know when the time is though like I don't know who are you,0.036774013
to know but I guess you know medical professionals can know and that's when they,0.009105699
tell you okay hospice or you know move to hospice care and move to like,0.022535091
okay you need to set up put your affairs in order like I guess so,0.12583745
but I don't know like things can happen or not like it's not up to,0.039172
just like us I feel like you know but that's like my religious viewpoint come,0.041990384
in through that it's up to God who knows you know God knows not us,0.038549386
so yeah so like I said I judged it very harshly spoiler alert so like,0.04606064
stop watching right now thanks for watching if you don't want to hear a spoiler,0.04179881
come back again after you've watched it and so like six years later 9i is,0.018460177
alive and well chillin healthy so once I saw that that like she is like,0.06318712
she had this horrible diagnosis that was legit and then they don't tell her because,0.09456051
it's the fear that's gonna get her then six years later she's bear I'm like,0.05497277
hold on do I have it wrong and they have it right with their lies,0.1170803
and deception and my truth is what's killing me what so when it showed that,0.2565651
I was like ah let's let me rethink this let me get my judgemental viewpoint,0.04008463
out of here let me put my judgments to a side and see what's like,0.06958154
working you know let's just go by the facts and the facts show that 9,0.029503556
I beat cancer by being lied to so I guess lies are the cure for,0.0994097
cancer we dance not Western medicine though that's Eastern but it works so I guess,0.08884259
we go with it and there was a doctor who I don't I think he,0.043117203
was trained like out and maybe in England or something and then he was a,0.04627616
Chinese young man who night I was trying to set up you know with Aquafina,0.038839407
and he spoke both English and and Mandarin and he was there during nine eyes,0.026200918
appointment where you know they're all talking in English around her like literally around her,0.034859613
discussing her her fatal / terminally terminal diagnosis and 9ice like oh does he ask,0.07036445
him like you know is is he single young man are you single like she's,0.03952654
asking asking in Mandarin and then Aquafina is like how bad is my grandma and,0.06676448
then he's just like oh you know like he just he lies tonight I like,0.1937833
they all talked about it when the doctor in front of my name like oh,0.014425837
yeah it's bad and then he's like 9 I you know you had pneumonia like,0.12637758
it's just the pneumonia a little bit like of a cold is still left like,0.0829637
no no it's her lungs and it's not pneumonia it's terminal which in pneumonia can,0.063051425
can kill you too sometimes but you know what I mean so with that I'm,0.6828009
saying I wanted to bring that point up because like the actual doctor who was,0.023180319
trained in like Western medicine and Western ways was also complicit in this whole lies,0.0664871
and shenanigans and deception so aquafina sort of calls him out on it and she's,0.15204768
like don't you think this is wrong and then he is just like you know,0.08865301
in China a lot of people do those been she's like what if it was,0.044492804
your grandma and he's like well actually when it was my grandma we lied man,0.2334961
she was just like oh okay that's that you know on good movie it was,0.11337457
a good movie I really enjoyed it a lot of strong women a lot of,0.21824941
different generations of women aquafina was not successful in her career I like that that,0.123348996
she was just like a young smart woman trying to make it who's having some,0.09418069
upsets in her career like very realistic and then she's you know an American going,0.043463763
back to China or going to China I mean and her mandarins a little funky,0.36067232
even though it's great like I was so with her speaking Mandarin the whole time,0.038568012
I was like get it aquafina come through with the Mandarin but I could hear,0.03513234
with my little baby I can hear that maybe she had an American accent when,0.047938455
she spoke like obviously I am still learning Mandarin I had not like talked about,0.0754744
anybody's anything with Mandarin but yeah it sounded like she sounded different than the native,0.052257493
speakers and then sometimes like her mom would come through with like these vicious statements,0.29470134
let's clap backs and but it wasn't even a clap back like it was just,0.051536433
like a like it wasn't a defence it was like offense I'm gonna say something,0.046902098
like rude so some people sometimes would be like you know aquafina uncle Mina's mandarin,0.09291685
isn't even good and then Aquafina was thinking of staying in China and not going,0.038478877
back to New York where she's from because all these different because is and then,0.0489961
her mom was like what so your grandma can see your long like sad face,0.43183205
nobody wants to see her face that's not good for anybody like it was so,0.2659001
funny but mean but I was here for it like you know mom's sometimes they,0.084563464
just can be mean so yeah good roles for women very nice way to introduce,0.13707905
a foreign concept in in a very like relatable way from awkwafina's point of view,0.026373202
as an American as a chinese-american dealing with something because her herself she also thought,0.07207331
it was not okay or thought it was weird and didn't approve so I really,0.04860497
enjoyed the movie awesome awesome movie end guys it was directed by a woman luang,0.22704002
