this movie coming out during August like doesn't mean it's not good but I want,0.03497203
to educate people let them know that movie has some significance to the timing of,0.018224036
this release date it comes out during the leaking of where the Charlottesville is that,0.019137334
it happened from last year and so I just wanted to let people know for,0.014339364
those of you who might not have known of many of you may have already,0.10029772
know just to give you a little background on the median and the significance behind,0.047282584
this film and the timing of its release so let's get into the review yeah,0.022719348
so I have to say that I really enjoyed this film first of all I,0.038317904
was watching this am I just like damn way I got just enough - I,0.20202692
was talking to two different people that like different times like they voices sound exactly,0.0479338
the same like yeah I don't think nothing was up like I'm trying to figure,0.037509706
out what shall work routing process if I will see where I can take that,0.021653058
much to get in the Ku Klux Klan but I'm just trying to figure out,0.08124686
how to jog it who boozled okay so when they stand out for me would,0.23355812
have to be John David Washington and also Topher Grace I'm so John Neville Washington,0.013971517
many of you who may know he is a son of Denzel one of the,0.052633986
greatest actors ever and he also um is in the TV show ballers which is,0.03439997
one of my favorites and is coming back on Sunday yeah so um he was,0.021044414
very entertaining playing Ron stallworth and so one of the favorite things he's very charismatic,0.046018735
on screen he's very funny how he says the work oh wait why I can't,0.023566127
even say how he says it but even when I saw in a trailer just,0.027194703
like how does he say why won't they like quite why kind of like I'm,0.03459354
like I don't know I'm just but you know one of the things that I,0.03297182
will have to say outside of it talking about racism and one of the themes,0.11709893
that had explored with his character was how being a black man and being a,0.022658816
cop like how hard something like that will be in either something that many people,0.06534698
go through today and I thought it was a very important topic to touch upon,0.06655295
I'm just because it is exploring his viewpoint as being a black man and seeing,0.26075166
how african-americans are treated in America and him trying to fight for the cause but,0.36907795
also to him wanting to inflict change from within by being a detective by making,0.07088131
sure that he can kind of train change the perceptions of people by working on,0.048269052
the others but how they could be stressful and how it can also be trying,0.020547522
because many of those who you are trying to give a voice to give the,0.015506096
voice to the voiceless they now they feel like you've betrayed your own race because,0.15914252
you are working for the same people who inflict pain upon us so I thought,0.09060466
it was very interesting for them to touch upon that and kind of show a,0.042652905
different viewpoint of what a black man will deal with while being a man in,0.39041755
uniform and so also - I think what Spike Lee does a well here is,0.017487679
he talks about a very heavy and just a heavy topic and many will say,0.056575198
that is a divisive topic about racism and how even exploring racism through the Ku,0.101930745
Klux Klan and back in that time and kind of shown the parallels of how,0.24967748
we're dealing with the same things in today's society I think that he does a,0.021780109
very good job on educating both sides and giving a material that is kind of,0.023281427
is heavy but due to the comedy of the film of the satire in the,0.039255813
film it kind of eases you into kind of that viewpoint or talking about that,0.11330805
topic of racism I was laughing and then like in the middle me black because,0.3255359
I was just like yo this is things stuff that be happening but it's funny,0.025125982
because they're like making fun of it then I'm like damn but this is I,0.31594947
really happening and there's a scene in the film where I kind of talked about,0.026906678
like they would this would never happen I'm like bread but it's happening right now,0.043430507
sorry both laugh and then I was shook cuz I was like whoa why is,0.042469982
this happening right now just can't even believe this but I think that audiences will,0.029749673
really appreciate how Spike Lee decides to tell this story through the satire but also,0.03100288
putting in real reminisce and showing history through through movies through the organizations like the,0.058563434
Ku Klux Klan and how some of these things that we may take lightly or,0.23710553
may not even think of the effect that it had dealing with racism like how,0.14074887
that is prevalent today and kind of how racism has evolved into a political landscape,0.10453028
and so I would say Topher Grace is the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux,0.08078522
Klan he was a second to me I'm just in this portrayal and his relationship,0.109185904
or on stallworth the conversations that they had it's just crazy because you're laughing cuz,0.05101626
you're just like this is so little Prince but people really think this way and,0.103162
the fact that this is a true story like the whole time I just like,0.011169098
yeah I can't even believe that this is true story man all this craziness happened,0.16047023
and so it shows even through Adam drivers character Flip Zimmerman who is Jews man,0.22452578
who was playing Ryan Sauber it's in person when he was meeting with the Ku,0.017026706
Klux Klan because obviously the real rocks are worth Kengo typical of his scheme but,0.23068623
yeah so even showing his progression and how he never really paid attention to racism,0.13507685
but being in this type of society in his organization and seeing how they act,0.06615385
in how they infiltrate all parts of society from being cops er just in the,0.25502276
small towns and it's just crazy like watching this an entire film I really think,0.21987845
that everyone did a very great job with the material that was given to them,0.022745289
now I will say there's a little bit of a peace an issue with this,0.06260376
film it's a little bit over two hours and at some point I could really,0.035148304
feel that it was two hours but for a majority of the entire film it,0.028106669
was still entertaining and enjoying for me what I love is towards the end of,0.03705738
the film how Spike Lee he takes you on this journey through satire and retelling,0.06337604
this true story but then at the end he kind of ties you or kind,0.026480962
of brings you back into your reality because the whole purpose of the movies are,0.033259183
kind of to escape into a different world but how he chooses to tie this,0.04843934
in and bring the audience back to the reality of what we're dealing with today,0.009829419
in today's society I thought it was brilliant it was amazing I got emotional torture,0.31521228
in the film I'm not gonna spoil it for how he did that but I,0.033724144
really enjoyed this film I think Spike Lee did a very very drive I think,0.060266968
that audiences are gonna enjoy this film I think the timing for this film is,0.014816301
perfect and I think this is going to be a huge success and this is,0.011803019
really going to kind of happen a lot of people been saying like Spike Lee,0.07176068
bit off lately but he backed out even though he didn't really be back okay,0.1454311
so for me for my Klansmen I would have to say that you paid to,0.05434484
see this film in theaters I thought it was amazing I absolutely loved it I,0.045361534
would encourage everyone to go support this movie to watch this movie and to learn,0.066715926
from this movie so as always those are my thoughts on black Klansmen my name,0.17238833
is Shauna from Peter wayton if you liked what you saw today make sure you,0.031928148
