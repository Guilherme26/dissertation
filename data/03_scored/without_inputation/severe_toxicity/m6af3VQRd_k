what is going on guys welcome back to my channel and this is my review,0.049562834
for the 2019 French film portrait of a lady on fire this movie was directed,0.053960364
by Celine ski Amma and this is about a young painter who is commissioned to,0.012536051
paint a portrait of a bride-to-be but the bride is reluctant she does not want,0.045531154
to get married and so this painter must paint her in secret as she spends,0.028924845
every single day with her walking on the beach and just being a friend and,0.081326015
little does the bride-to-be know that she is being painted by someone she admires and,0.025380747
respects this is a film that I've wanted to see for a while it's a,0.020856168
movie that you know kind of was unjustly not nominated for the Academy Awards and,0.019389438
I thought that was a little interesting so I wanted to see really what this,0.021392306
movie was truly about and if this movie did deserve an Oscar nomination for Best,0.041478857
International Feature and I gotta say that it deserved a Best International Feature nomination this,0.01863512
is a movie that is beautiful number one the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking it is,0.03335031
the first film to be conceived that I have seen in 8k all of the,0.024345722
colors are so rich they're so clear I mean it looks unrealistic because it's so,0.07007244
realistic and that's the thing that this movie truly has going for it is it,0.034467157
has this beautiful way of almost painting every single scene knowing that this is a,0.044110987
movie about a painter who has to paint this bride-to-be and this is a film,0.034820367
that has a beautiful love story that is almost hopeful but yet hopeless and that's,0.02339717
the thing that I think I I loved the most about this film is it,0.042346258
tells it from a very real perspective these two women they fall in love but,0.21292661
the problem is is that there's no way that this romance is ever going to,0.016813846
last and because of certain obligations that one of them has to having to be,0.02231425
married to a man that she doesn't even know or she hasn't even met and,0.08075196
this this painter who kind of lives by herself and has to be almost independent,0.09386739
and so it's a very secretive affair or relationship that these two women have and,0.12512304
it's told from a very realistic perspective of how this actually would never happen in,0.02754459
a true society back in the time period that this movie said him that's one,0.051747963
thing that this movie has going for is that it is a very beautiful love,0.038812134
story that truly shows the true strengths and the true weaknesses of a true romantic,0.020076573
encounter in true romantic relationship and these women it's almost like they have to rush,0.22963746
everything all at once because they only have so much time to spend with one,0.03433412
another before they both have to part and go their separate ways and it's it's,0.031469174
heartbreaking it's very heart wrenching and you feel for these two characters as they finally,0.02149275
have that happiness that they've been longing for throughout the entirety of their lives now,0.08342201
the thing about this movie to me also that I thought was very well done,0.033431467
is the way that this movie paints the scene of the setting around these characters,0.026298035
again the cinematography is almost painted on it's so gorgeous but to setting them itself,0.0633461
on this island it just almost has an eeriness to it it's it's almost a,0.03969816
little creepy but they never try to go for a hauntings and that's the thing,0.11121139
that I really respect it for because this is a movie you could look at,0.033115502
in certain scenes where you think oh are they gonna go like a little bit,0.06124745
more of a paranormal route are they gonna go like a little bit more of,0.05019742
this like creepy contingent route but they never do that they keep it very contained,0.04715354
they know exactly what they're doing and it's a very different romantic film because it's,0.028202455
it's a movie that almost essentially is it romantic and the fact that it is,0.014236925
so romantic and I don't know if that makes a lot of sense but they,0.021726228
don't ever truly romanticize these characters or make them out as their objects and that,0.053982314
it's a very lustful relationship it's very much a loving relationship between these two characters,0.04264226
the one thing that I will say is is not a negative but it's something,0.02620491
that I was a little bit maybe dissatisfied with is the way that the movie,0.028264318
wraps up because I thought that to me the way that they ended it made,0.030492684
sense but to me I was a little dissatisfied in the way that this movie,0.026671868
kind of wraps itself up because essentially these two characters after they have their romantic,0.07808059
time together and they have this love for one another they go on their separate,0.03985315
ways and essentially they don't ever really meet up again only in certain sir stances,0.031732585
that I don't want to discuss because I don't want to rob you of any,0.1490324
spoilers or any potential spoilers for this film and so the way that they kind,0.06732856
of wrapped these characters up in the satisfaction of them kind of meeting again at,0.029486926
the end of the film never happens and it never comes into fruition and so,0.023445062
that is a little bit disappointing because you definitely want to see the conclusion between,0.09203215
these two characters and the restitution as well between both of them as they both,0.018555963
have this longing for one another and they do things that are beautiful that symbolize,0.06968198
that both of them still love each other but they don't do it to the,0.0387536
effect of bringing them together and that's the one thing that I think this movie,0.027935052
could have done a little bit better of a job of doing but I get,0.03497868
the fact that they want to be more realistic and they don't want it to,0.019533118
be like essentially a formulaic romantic film but anyway guys this is a great movie,0.035359833
I think that this is a fantastic international film that I think all of you,0.041879963
can enjoy and I'm really happy that I was able to watch it as part,0.02802086
