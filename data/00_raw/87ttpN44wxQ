what's up Kryptonians happy holidays I hope everybody enjoyed to get in my belly day aka Thanksgiving I know I did I had a freaking blast on Thanksgiving in fact I had about three or four food babies I got pregnant late Friday night I went into labor Saturday morning in my bathroom Sunday just for kicks I had some leftover sex I had pretty much a big gigantic bowl of delicious you know what you know what we're gonna leave my love life out of this for a moment and instead we're just gonna focus on cocoa because I didn't get a chance to talk about cocoa over the last weekend it came out this last weekend I want to talk about cocoa is a Latina flashes panic inspired Disney Pixar movie about this kid who really really really wants to be a musician his name is Miguel he loves music but in his family due to some unfortunate circumstances that happened way way way back then music has been outlawed it has been banned it has been banished in their family nobody can think talk about or play any kind of music so one night during the day of the dead that they celebrate in Latino culture he accidentally finds himself transported to the land of the day I guess to the land of the dead he meets the rest of his family and then he has to go on a journey to try to get back to the land of the living and along the way discovering some things about himself personally and about his family that he maybe never even knew before only crap on a cracker this movie surprised the hell out of me I did not expect this movie to be this good like at oh I saw the trailers for the thing and I was just kind of like I will the trailers are there okay they look kind of boring it looks kind of like cliched Disney stuff and it's gonna hit us in the fields in yada yada yada yada yeah we've seen this routine before but no no Coco is actually one of the best animated films of the year this movie surprised the hell out of me on multiple levels first of all the animation for the movie is top notch as it should be as it usually isn't almost all of the Pixar movies very colorful it's very vibrant it's very smooth it's very in-your-face everything looks perfect and sleek and well produced it's the kind of animation that every animated film should try to emulate along with that the voice acting is really good the only three names I can remember I remember anthony gonzalez who i think plays the main kid in this movie he got benjamin bratt as his friend hector in this movie and then i'm gonna no wait no benjamin bratt plays somebody else pretty sure the other guy's name was thinking about his guy el Garcia Bernal I think is his name and everyone else I'm sorry I just I can't remember and can't pronounce your name I'm notoriously bad with names so don't take it as a slight I mean honestly just think about this would you prefer that I forget your name and just kind of out of respect don't say it or would you rather me try to say it and completely butcher and ruin your name I can kind of feel like you would just want me to skip over it and say you did a good job characters though the characters I got to talk about these characters the characters in this movie are awesome they make the entire movie they carry the entire movie on their backs this main kid Miguel he's he's the kind of hopeful optimistic eternally determined character that you just gravitate towards and you want to see him succeed the kid that is all about being a musician he is going to do whatever he can whatever is in his power whatever is in his bones to be musicians this he knows what's in his heart and you just you can't help her root for somebody like that you just can't his friend that he's working with in the movie his name is Hector he meets him in the land of the dead I I honestly thought he was just gonna be one of those annoying tag-along characters but no no his character actually surprisingly had more layers than than I was expecting all of the characters in this movie the characters that make up his family the characters that he meets when he's in the land of the day everybody is just I want to see more of these characters I wouldn't mind seeing if Coco - hey you know what this movie has this movie has some really important and surprisingly complex and thought-provoking messages about the importance of family about the impact of music about the impact of your history a lot of important themes about following your dreams and the cost that dreams can have on you personally as well as the people that are following you the people that are closest to you I feel like all of that was done in a surprisingly thoughtful and still emotion away and by the end of the movie I was just sitting there I was not only getting rocked in the fields I was also getting rocked in the head because I was kind of like yo that shit's pretty deep oh sorry I'm just I'm trying to I'm trying to scrape at the bottom of the barrel to find legitimate flaws with this thing seriously I got out of this movie and I was straining I was struggling to find legitimate things wrong with the movie that I didn't like and I suppose you could say that maybe the world of the land of the dead is not as interesting after you first get there than it is when he first sees the thing it's much the characters that making you don't really care you don't really know too much about the other rules of this world and you would have liked to have seen that expanded upon but the more I think about it the more that sounds like such a nitpick in the end coca was the animated movie that I definitely wanted and needed it to be and it was Superman prime material guys so have you seen Coco tell me what you thought about it and tell me what your favorite animated film of the year is as a result so I can subscribe to the superfan show and as always if you like what you see tell me how you feel and stay tuned to hear more from the Man of Steel also there is a special link in the description below if you click on it you will help this channel prosper in ways that you couldn't imagine hey guys talk to you later [Music] you [Music]
