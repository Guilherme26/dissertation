so Coco it's not I like it but it's not I want to fix our best it's not even on my like list of one of this year best even though it's really really good I enjoy it you know great animation great voice acting but I feel like the story is not something that I've never seen before it's a bit predictable in that way and a lot of people is like oh this movie's gonna like make you cry and whatnot it didn't like I feel the emotion but it didn't make me cry but still seven out of ten for me remember me that movie was an absolute masterpiece absolute masterpiece from the animation to the sound the music and the storytelling and characters beginning to end that movie was a masterpiece it'll make you smile and make you happy make you laugh make you sad make you cry make you angry this movie runs the whole gamut it'll make you rejoice he'll make you feel satisfied this movie runs the whole emotional spectrum and it has it all I really don't say that about many movies and I haven't been going to see a lot of animated movies in the theater I always tend to kind of wait until they come out to watch them the last animated movie I think that ice and psycho moji movie or lego movie or something like that but anyway man this is on another level Pixar Pixar Disney goddamn this movie is a movie for the whole family to see I see this movie being one of the favorites like for a long time I mean this movie was good it really was good I'd seen a couple of uh other movie reviews on YouTube specifically John Campea I believe who raved about this and he raved so much that when I happened to be looking through Fandango for movies to see I felt back to that yeah I think he raved about this I mean he way he talked about how good it was he was something extraordinary something supernatural about this movie I was just like wow it was thick and if he could've here heard me I'm sure he would have said yes good man that's that camp you talks man no I only know where to start all I gotta say you know this is about this young Mexican boy who has a love of music and kind of runs through his family but it kind of doesn't at the same time and he wants to follow his dreams and he sets off on a path of this musical dream which puts him in contact with something he really shouldn't have been in contact with which put him in contact with the world of the dead on the day of the dead coincidentally which allows him to meet certain family members and characters and inspirations in his life and it is it is his journey to get back to the living world and I got to tell you I mean in this I gotta tell you man damn this movie was satisfying to watch this is just a joy to just sit there and enjoy the detail just everything about the movie was great and I gotta tell you there is a point in this movie where you're just so happy and you are feeling so just so good for this kid and there is this to West but I was like oh my god are you [ __ ] kidding me like it was just it was crazy cuz you was it was going the way you thought it was gonna go but then it doesn't go the way you thought it was going to go and then another thing is revealed and I'm like wow oh my god so it's just it was a good movie had good sidekicks man's movie had spirit animals in it and just you know it was it was too good man and you know what I'm wondering if if it would speak more because it was very ethnic you know sometimes you can see a movie that said somewhere else but it's very very Americanized something about this very felt very ethnic I was just like wow I just feel like they really to people about this they really spoke to some Mexican folk and hag they they actually directed them through this movie because I almost felt like that if you were Mexican let me know if you Mexican in conversation did it really cuz not sometimes you will say oh oh no well I ain't really cared for this movie or I don't think I liked it as much as I should have because I couldn't relate to a lot of stuff in it like a lot this Day of the Dead stuff and all that stuff like I know about it but I don't know know about it you know I mean and I'm wondering if a lot of Mexican people identified with this movie or if you identified much more because a lot of this stuff made sense to you like the characters really related to you you had a grandfather like this or uncle like this you know kid like this well you know your grandma's like your mom you know what I mean sometimes lady egg like when I see movies at a base you know that around african-americans whatever sometimes it's like certain things are funnier to me because and I get it because I'm black it might be funny to somebody else but they don't get it get it get it you know I mean you might get the joke but you don't get it get it cuz you know ain't got a funcle' Leroy that's just like this you know what I mean so I just gotta say man left you feeling good left you feeling good I loved it I loved it Pixar five out of five
