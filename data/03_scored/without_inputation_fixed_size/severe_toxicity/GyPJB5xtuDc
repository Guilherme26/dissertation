right now we are talking the favorite a movie I had to watch before I,0.028517753
made that top 10 best list and I'm glad I watched it let's talk about,0.020965258
the good so in eighteenth-century England the close relationship between Queen Anne and Sarah Churchill,0.018757513
is threatened by the arrival of Sarah's cousin Abigail Hill resulting in a bitter rivalry,0.044343803
between the two cousins to be the Queen's favorite and what a film this was,0.017709184
it is not going to be for everyone but this is the most audience friendly,0.041752912
movie that your ghost lanthum owes has done so far and I do believe the,0.07179327
favorite is his best movie I watch killing of a sacred deer I liked it,0.37614906
I didn't like it as much as a lot of people liked it I thought,0.023520894
it was a bit underwhelming enjoy the film style enjoyed the technical aspects but the,0.062712185
story did not grip me like the story for the favorite did and the performances,0.022773892
while they were great these performances are some of the best I've seen all year,0.011215662
Olivia Colman Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone all three are going to be considered for,0.07837925
Oscars should get nominated for Oscars and another performance that not a lot of people,0.036539868
have been talking about that I've heard of so far nicholas hoult gives possibly my,0.022551721
best performance that he has ever given other than of course our boy in Mad,0.079603195
Max and the beast in x-men I like those for other reasons but acting wise,0.10419636
I think he is brilliant in this film all the performances are top-notch they should,0.030434147
be nominated considered possibly winning level performances now I did just see Emily Blunt and,0.012909885
Mary Poppins that was a great performance but it's just going to be such a,0.025515115
great competition as it should be because the director just brought out so much in,0.017936012
these characters and the writing some of the best writing I have seen all year,0.0057471865
the dialogue is so crisp it's funny it's witty its off-the-cuff it seems like and,0.029367194
it has that level of humor some of the humor is in your face in,0.12617469
a good way some of the humor is subtle it has the best balance of,0.013626952
two completely different styles of humor that I have seen all year and it's real,0.007862471
it's real dialogue it's not like these people were completely proper and they are completely,0.08649982
against humor no there's a bit of corn ball in here these characters are goofy,0.17302491
they are not afraid to be themselves they're not afraid to open up to the,0.035058506
world and that comes back to the plot in the direction that this movie goes,0.055236183
because it really does just open itself up and allow us to dissect what is,0.034393985
happening even though we may not completely know what some of these metaphors mean there's,0.021694299
a lot of things in here that you really need to dive deep into and,0.029826835
I should have watched this movie twice before I reviewed it just because there is,0.030126167
a lot happening in the background a lot to pay attention to a lot of,0.019928237
things especially towards the end that tie back to the beginning things that characters say,0.029164977
lines of dialogue in the first half come back to play in the second half,0.035480894
and the way that the movie ends is going to be interpreted in different ways,0.050206732
by a lot of different people I'm not saying it's an open-ended ending it's just,0.15877467
an ending that you can think about and oh maybe it meant this but maybe,0.058712434
it meant this not inception style you'll know when you'll see it it's hard to,0.053825997
explain it but it's something that people will be able to dissect and I think,0.061204877
that's going to make the movie even better in the long run and here's an,0.0312031
odd comparison I enjoyed a movie like the mule I had a good time in,0.07998301
the theater but once I walked out and started to think about it and dissect,0.030794011
the characters and some of the acting I really kind of cooled down on the,0.04502229
film I didn't like it as much as I did when I walked out with,0.034693982
the favorite I don't know if I sat there and I was on the edge,0.042488605
of my seat like oh my gosh what's going to happen next no I was,0.06376583
just invested in these people's lives so the entertainment factor while it was there it,0.044434268
wasn't super strong and I wasn't super like on the edge of my seat but,0.0426855
after I walked out and I started think about it and I started to dissect,0.04175358
the characters and what that ending actually meant and how some characters were just completely,0.013489924
treated in the wrong way and got completely screwed over if we're being honest I'm,0.13427064
not going to say who it really made me like this movie so much more,0.04952558
and those are the best movies in my opinion the ones where you can walk,0.04529169
out think about a little bit dissect to have conversations with your friends unfortunately I,0.15848799
saw this by myself so I couldn't have any conversations but I still really enjoy,0.042996805
just sitting and riding out my review on letterboxed and thinking about it and that,0.16550036
made the movie even better lanthum as always brings a distinct style in his films,0.079589225
killing of a sacred deer and the lobster they're all odd they're quirky and the,0.34656045
favorite is probably his most quirky film but like I said at the beginning of,0.022646843
this review it's also his most audience friendly you can get on board with these,0.019790543
characters you can understand this a bit better than something like the killing of a,0.22041725
sacred deer and you can get invested in these characters a little bit more and,0.0347472
I loved loved loved loved the technical aspects the film style using the fish eye,0.060822397
lens for certain situations close-ups and he always does this but I noticed it even,0.042629626
more in the favorite I love when we look up on a character usually we're,0.012699021
looking straight forward or down but having the camera lower and looking up at Emma,0.07317153
Stone's character and looking up at Olivia Komen's character it was an interesting choice and,0.034162503
it allowed us to really dive even deeper into the psyche of them it's something,0.052041307
we see on television a lot not as much in movies but I really like,0.03226673
the decisions just the mixing of different film styles makes this film even better than,0.019668816
I think it would have been and it elevates the material as well this movie,0.040254917
was funny the general audience that I was with we were all laughing invested it,0.020405838
takes some twists and turns that you definitely do not anticipate I had no clue,0.03141396
where this story was going and I loved how this thing this giant war this,0.065154076
peace treaty it's all going on in the background but that's not what we're focused,0.03319599
on we're focused on the interactions the jealousy within Rachel and Emma's characters you don't,0.014210983
know what's going to happen next between them you can see it build up and,0.045788582
then once it comes to a head and then once you get that reveal about,0.07879566
halfway through the movie or like oh I did not see this coming and it,0.04626818
continues to increase it continues to get a little bit more heated if you know,0.07105159
what I mean you know what I mean you've seen the movie but it just,0.032710407
it keeps elevating and once it comes to a head it really really hit in,0.2704703
terms of negatives I mean I don't have that many it wasn't the most entertaining,0.0377352
movie I've seen all year there's not a major event that happens but there doesn't,0.016525822
need to be that it's a story that sticks to its guns it does exactly,0.06930815
what it needs to do with really great dialogue a hilarious moments and a bit,0.052351948
of a seductive nature that I personally really enjoyed did not expect and if I,0.021522682
was there with my parents I would have been like oh they chose wrong movie,0.027281176
some of it may have been a bit too odd for people and some of,0.04665199
the dialogue might be a bit too much in certain scenes I have this complaint,0.05016549
more often than not carry on a bit too long I think this movie could,0.03806181
have been even shorter than it was and I would not have been bothered by,0.049451746
that but overall I think the favorite was worth every penny if you're going and,0.055048604
watching in a theatre and I do think you need to see it before you,0.08781954
guys at home make your top 10 lists for the end of the year because,0.025719326
if you are a fan of film and the technical aspects and the nature of,0.014427833

and that is why I am going to give this movie a 93 percent it,0.0453163
is on the cusp of being in my top 10 movies of the year I,0.030761417
