hi my name is an angel and today I will be reviewing the movie ladybird,0.20929359
a 20-17 coming-of-age story of a young girl going through high school and dealing with,0.12932943
emotions family drama hormones all of that it was written and directed by Greta Gerwig,0.15024205
oh go girl I think this is like her debut and she was nominated at,0.15201439
the Oscars if you're like me you're not really into coming-of-age movies I've mentioned before,0.26706788
that it's like somebody moving a rock from one place to another where you see,0.075789705
a tiny evolution in the character it doesn't mean much to me that being said,0.040700357
I really enjoy Lady Bird I didn't expect to seeing the trailer and hearing about,0.09583905
it it didn't seem like I would be able to relate to it first of,0.04130209
all not only was it a coming-of-age story but it's also about this young girl,0.13857843
and the dynamic in a home with a mother that I could not relate to,0.060078032
are identify with because of cultural differences so I really thought I would just sit,0.082016364
there and be like oh she has nothing to complain about she's just gonna be,0.15343979
why me and the typical distressed teenager that were so used to seeing on TV,0.09488842
luckily I was wrong it's a bit of that but not that much this movie,0.10885981
is really about being a teenage girl being so wrapped up in your own life,0.5099438
and your journey to self-discovery that you don't realize how you are such a small,0.57683915
part of a larger scale called the world and how your actions can really affect,0.07637433
the people around you I was once a teenage girl and I know that for,0.14939268
a fact I was terrible I hope to never have a teenage daughter of my,0.2415906
own you are so much so in your head and dealing with so many things,0.44191316
especially if you're in a kind of toxic home environment that only adds layers to,0.1838623
it and a toxic school environment where you're being bullied or ostracized or whatever you,0.1954869
don't understand yourself and you're comparing yourself to others and you're just trying to figure,0.24248345
out who am i who are my role models do I look to the Bible,0.10999517
do I look to TV do I look to magazines do I look to my,0.0920524
own mother I don't know none of these examples seem to fit me and there's,0.22444373
just an inner frustration that fuels a lot of your actions if you're that type,0.1181774
of teenage girl not all obviously are that way but Lady Bird is and that's,0.26102167
what we see Lady Bird aka Christine played by Saoirse Ronan I hope I got,0.09696084
her name right is your rebellious teenager who is having an identity crisis in high,0.24286698
school she is also in a Catholic high school I grew up with a Catholic,0.054399803
mother I went to church it's an inflexible environment for a girl to really discover,0.14239186
who she is Saoirse did such a great job at portraying this girl so naturally,0.267094
you could see her being frustrated and angsty and wanting to be loved and wanting,0.4665214
to be understood and not knowing who she is but she's got that cockiness that,0.60459673
young girls have like I know everything I've got this whole world figured out and,0.36625096
she's careless sometimes with her words and doesn't realize that they actually carry weights especially,0.091082394
with her parents for example and college is her Savior her saving grace we cannot,0.099991016
wait to go to college and leave her world behind and I can totally relate,0.19516626
to that feeling what makes this movie so sweet and endearing is the relationships between,0.079974204
all of the characters especially as they relate to Lady Bird Laurie Metcalf plays the,0.041800614
mother and she plays her so so well there are layers of complexity between a,0.089766026
mother that is reaching out for her daughter but also pushing her away because her,0.24541058
daughter consistently hurts her she doesn't always know how to take it without taking it,0.28742567
personally and understanding that she's just a teenager she's gonna say harsh things she's the,0.20578565
matriarch holding this family together she has so much on her shoulders a very demanding,0.26885024
job as a nurse financial hardship she's trying to get her daughter through college she's,0.19282131
also the spouse of a person dealing with depression and who has been for years,0.107750475
all of these things are super heavy for one person to carry on their shoulders,0.18285039
and that's what a lot of mothers out there do and then she has a,0.104332894
deal with her daughters and teenage news a daughter only sees her relationship with her,0.17958155
mother so she believes that everything her mother is feeling the way her mother is,0.25188345
a moaning it's all because of her and that's why the relationship can be often,0.44532156
combative and that's why she can come to conclusions like do you even like me,0.16525926
I felt so bad for my own mother when I watched the thinking about everything,0.24057278
she went through that was behind closed doors you know you don't know as a,0.15127525
kid all the layers of your parents lives but I'm not saying that the parents,0.37551036
are blameless I mean her mother's words are really harsh sometimes and as the female,0.38624498
role model for a daughter you were supposed to build your child up not cut,0.20809685
her down in such petty ways a lot of moms are like that they don't,0.31089434
realize it that all their compliments are backhanded oh I didn't know that you were,0.14771558
capable of such heights thank you helps with self-esteem the mom mentions that she had,0.08870509
a hard mother of her own so she kind of learned to be not so,0.35663015
caring that way it reminded me of Tonya Harding's mother in I Tania who also,0.12938786
had the excuse of I didn't like my mother so get over it there are,0.15024568
slight similarities between the two mothers but also vast differences I would say the only,0.113824666
similarity is that you see these mothers that are working so hard to create a,0.14486773
financially stable as much as possible environment for their families for their kids but at,0.04237046
the cost of an emotional relationship a bond time spent with these kids with these,0.06626533
teenagers especially and also at the cost of their own personal happiness they feel an,0.051949173
obligation to do certain things and that may be Noble but their unhappiness is kind,0.10912894
of heavy and kids aren't stupid they notice these kind of things they can tell,0.6596303
when mom's not alright and it affects them it was also interesting to see the,0.11961534
father/daughter relationship as opposed to the mother-daughter and father was played by Tracy Letts and,0.14355811
for quite frankly I loved him why wasn't he nominated for Best Supporting character at,0.055740017
the Oscars is beyond me he is such a sweet caring father he's gentle he's,0.11165759
patient human and warm and present for his family and going through his own things,0.07203825
you know his own struggles his own life issues and I love how he did,0.11739466
want to interfere he did not want to come in between his daughter's relationship with,0.4032934
her mother he seemed to respect boundaries although he tried to in subtle ways push,0.2413383
them closer together and help them with the gaps in communication that would exist he,0.09448112
was an exceptional father and we're so used to seeing either absent fathers or angry,0.13137144
fathers were bumbling Homer Simpson's of fathers it was a real person that's what I,0.4635106
love about this movie every character is a full person not just uni-dimensional like we're,0.09879598
used to seeing not just accessories to the main characters life behind them there's a,0.07868255
whole other movie beanie Feldstein plays Julie ladybirds best friend and I absolutely adored their,0.15266395
friendship it's so innocent and pure and silly they have an arc in their friendship,0.5876557
that is not uncommon at all it's actually refreshing to see that kind of arc,0.07615435
where sometimes in the journey to self-discovery we lose touch with our childhood friends or,0.10318524
very close friends they really had such a sweet friendship I loved it so so,0.089682296
much I loved the nun played by Lois Smith at the school she was so,0.0601745
sweet she had such a great soul and a great sense of humor this movie,0.10033904
is not making fun of Catholics or showing them in the typical stick up the,0.360912
but super serious super judgmental she was warm she was exactly what you would want,0.14975663
a religious person to be tolerant light hearted almost like a therapist who can see,0.11370184
through your bowl and see the real you loved it and her line about love,0.07410843
is paying attention Greta mind-blown I had never thought of love that way and ever,0.11562952
since I've been trying to pay attention to the things I'm paying attention to and,0.07544524
the people I'm paying attention to to see if I am actually expressing my love,0.09198148
for people and things properly and when you boil it down that's basically what Lady,0.4263147
Bird and all teenagers want they want attention they want that love they want their,0.074446134
parents to notice them their friends to notice that they want to be seen and,0.06830143
what's interesting is that ladybirds parents do what a lot of parents do they work,0.2681861
really hard to create a safe environment for their kids and it's in this kind,0.061463542
of environment that Lady Bird actually has the luxury of time to overthink her life,0.2402168
her actions herself whereas there are a lot of kids around the world who are,0.19169421
illegally working also contributing to the family's finances or taking care of siblings or dealing,0.13121644
with situations that a kid should not be dealing with they don't have that privilege,0.16713755
of being angsty and broken and sorrowful they just so traumatized that they're just barreling,0.34968308
through life there is a privilege to being an angry teenager who can just mouth,0.27968052
off without the fear of repercussions ladybirds boyfriend Danny reminded me of the whole call,0.097956456
me by your name plots and again the movie portrays him with such love and,0.11273645
care and sweetness and in their dynamic they're both going through very different things and,0.064307526
Lady Bird takes his of evolution personally and she makes about herself because I what,0.15274277
teenagers do but then they have a sweet moment where she actually realizes oh I'm,0.08463049
in his story I'm in his narrative right now I need to be there for,0.06917888
him as a friend speaking of call me by your name we got team with,0.102562785
deshyla made makes an appearance yes Kyle and his group of friends I know those,0.08420395
kids they just are so blase blase I call them they think they're woke but,0.49441794
they're really just extra and those kids are usually like the cool kid that's cool,0.06784175
the people that just don't care and they're just themselves and they're so chill and,0.23897353
emotionless and just like yeah we do bad things I can so relate ladybird wanting,0.26800507
to be like them being approved and accepted by the cool kids makes you cool,0.04389584
and I like that she had the opportunity to get close enough to see the,0.08211988
truth that these kids are usually dealing with a lot also back home and it's,0.052893404
harder than them in a way they actually have a usually very absentee parents wealthy,0.1526707
but absentee I'm just gonna reference the last scene without going too much into it,0.07530063
but this movie did remind me of when I went away to college and how,0.09529578
happy and emotionless I was I couldn't wait to leave and how emotional my mom,0.35513735
and the tears and I was just like why are you crying I'll see you,0.1812517
in a few months I'll come back for the holidays I'm just excited to be,0.060474403
alone living on my own in a city with other teenagers my age going to,0.18623951
school and being crazy and having access to things i never had access to before,0.3324303
but over time coming and going leaving home evolutions in my relationships with my own,0.08722496
mother made the departures a little harder every time until you get to the point,0.16823961
where you really do cry when you leave home luckily I got to that place,0.13304318
so when I was watching momma McPherson I could really feel her heaviness and running,0.25198758
away from that pain I thought it was nice that they also showed us a,0.10084854
little more and the last scene was sweet this movie really is kind of like,0.074904874
a love letter to mother-daughter relationships I'm so glad I enjoyed it and I really,0.13101692
hope that a lot of people can open their hearts to it and see what,0.05827637
happens it's enjoyable it's sweet it's funny it's consistently entertaining I never got bored and,0.099616624
that's saying a lot for a coming-of-age movie so yeah I recommend it Lady Bird,0.2667918
