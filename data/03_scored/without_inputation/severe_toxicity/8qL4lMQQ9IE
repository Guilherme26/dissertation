[Applause] starwars the last Jedi was directed by Rian Johnson and stars a whole bunch,0.025285626
of people and porks and it's about Rafe in Poe Luke Leia kylo and a,0.099998385
whole bunch of Star Wars folk on a big adventure and that's all I'm gonna,0.082216695
say you should just go see it I'm not saying anything else joking aside if,0.056402918
you saw the force awakens you know that it quite literally ended with a cliffhanger,0.07738747
Rey extending that lightsaber out to Luke and us wondering what he's gonna do with,0.017445106
it this film answers that question and a lot of other questions and has a,0.019066824
lot of fun doing it and I had a blast watching the last Jedi this,0.107075945
is a really really damn entertaining Star Wars movie and one with a unique voice,0.33610165
Brian Johnson is able to direct this film and please I'm sure the vast majority,0.036416143
of Star Wars fans but his voice is not lost in the shuffle I've seen,0.069630094
all of his films I've been a fan of his ever since brick that was,0.09848376
one of the very first movies on my channel that I gave an A+ to,0.019465934
my highest rating the vision that he has shown in films like brick and looper,0.055111796
and even the Brothers Bloom is very much so present here he has a great,0.027194703
knack for filming terrific action sequences and his voice and his humor are ever-present in,0.04961605
this film it's a very funny movie just like the force awakens was a lot,0.062014405
of great jokes and none of them feel like they're at the expense of the,0.033310402
characters it doesn't feel like they're referencing things either just to reference them sure there,0.007379547
are winks and nods and references but to ask the eighth film in a saga,0.018025147
to act like the others didn't even exist I think is unfair but the fanservice,0.052168358
in the last Jedi does not come at an expense to the story it doesn't,0.019570367
feel like a throwaway moment like in rogue one where we saw at c-3po just,0.044482827
going oh yes I'm in this movie because I'm in every Star Wars movie and,0.044391032
we couldn't have it not be in this it doesn't feel like the fanservice in,0.020320695
the last Jedi is there because oh yeah I remember that Star Wars thing Johnson's,0.02428519
love for Star Wars and for these characters shines through but also ways that he,0.029584043
questions certain things that have become established in star wars I'll talk more about this,0.027902458
in my spoiler review but the film does bring up things about previous Star Wars,0.019417375
stories and asks questions that I think people walking into this universe like our new,0.02167368
characters would logically want to know about and the film has a surprising way of,0.012520752
exploring these questions let's talk a little bit about the performances Daisy Ridley once again,0.045952883
is proving to be an excellent choice as Rey she's terrific in the action sequences,0.027849244
and the dramatic stuff she's an incredible actress John boyega once again amazing his fin,0.06876203
oh boy let's talk about Carrie Fisher this was tough this was really hard for,0.021829996
me actually because she was kind of a childhood hero of mine and of course,0.16367243
when she passed away this was one of the the real celebrity deaths that actually,0.09074236
kind of affected me and it was it was tough seeing her in this film,0.08829249
but I think they did a great job with her character and it has some,0.02710823
truly satisfying moments and it was just it was really nice to see her on,0.08199386
screen and she was great in this movie Mark Hamill is the best he has,0.03681193
ever been has Luke Skywalker and this is easily his best performance he is magnificent,0.050843313
in this film every single scene with him was awesome he was really really good,0.0662769
this is a character as I said dealing with quite a bit obviously he has,0.07308705
secluded himself on this island and so some history has led to that and the,0.039711464
exploration of that in this film was wonderful Hamill you really knocked it out of,0.12932633
the park you gave me everything I wanted in a Luke Skywalker and everything I,0.051026236
didn't know I wanted I'm sure has a lot of you know he has said,0.03272371
that he was kind of surprised by the direction Rian Johnson took and I can,0.01606751
see why and it definitely paid off I think this is a very unique vision,0.03456028
and that's what I'll say for now until the spoiler review this is definitely definitely,0.014969958
different when it comes to his character Johnson has also done something with the action,0.01623181
sequences in particular anything involving a lightsaber that I have wanted for ever my favorite,0.024722215
shots any lightsaber battles are always the head-to-toe wides the beautiful grand master shots that,0.30782032
feature our heroes and you can see their entire body the choreography and it just,0.028139263
feels incredibly epic the lightsaber sequences in this film have some of the most beautiful,0.029929273
wide shots I have ever seen it's very apparent how much Ryan Johnson has been,0.0583233
inspired by Japanese films by samurai films anime it all feels very much so like,0.023287414
the Jedi are almost samurai and if I'm wrong and that wasn't what he was,0.029588034
going for that's what I saw and some of the imagery here is gorgeous the,0.03415186
action sequences are some of my favorite that I've seen in a Star Wars movie,0.013958879
they're really really good Adam driver as kylo Ren continues to be very compelling a,0.033606406
terrific performance he and force awakens I thought was a very conflicted and deep character,0.07337441
not your average villain he wasn't done yet he wasn't fully trained he wasn't ready,0.10433738
he had angry deep-seated emotion that really shone through in his work and he is,0.034706622
amazing here and this film continues to deepen kylo ren's legacy in ways that I,0.02352289
cannot wait to talk about in the spoiler review really satisfied with everything they did,0.021382993
in this movie with every major character Oscar Isaac is once again amazing as PO,0.038629875
such a likable presence let's talk about Finn and Rose because this leads me into,0.087765664
my issues with the last Jedi there's a storyline here that involves these characters Finn,0.026314665
and Rose that feels like an extended short film almost like the movie just stops,0.032648545
and becomes something else something else I didn't really enjoy all that much it's a,0.029905992
sequence on another world that feels almost too much like Earth this place they go,0.035335887
just did not feel like a galaxy far far away it felt like a place,0.052717134
you might see here on earth just with a few more exotic creatures but it,0.104096584
wasn't just the setting it was the fact that it basically screeched the story to,0.024279868
a halt and every time it cut back to them I was like okay is,0.1230929
this gonna get more interesting here is this gonna get better reminded me of in,0.029182937
the Phantom Menace documentary when George Lucas had just seen The Phantom Menace for the,0.017433798
first time and you see him sitting there in the theater agonizing over the fact,0.08046727
that he can't remove anything because it all connects and he's just kind of like,0.037181105
oh boy well Rick what do we do I can't really remove any of that,0.049432456
stuff because they're all kind of you know interweaves oh boy you know a special,0.11693995
effect without a story is a pretty boring thing Rick you know oh boy Jar,0.04295224
Jar is the key to all of this jokes aside this sequence with Finn and,0.034479793
Rose it's just too far along and the things that they have to do sure,0.01660764
it effects the plot later but they're just should have been an easier and quicker,0.052454386
way to do some of these things because it feels like a detour an unnecessary,0.053881206
detour it reminded me of in Avengers age of Ultron when Thor goes off looking,0.037327446
for that pool you're just like what all right unfortunately this sequence is necessary to,0.09459577
set up some things that you're supposed to care about later and I just didn't,0.023708476
we'll talk more about that in the spoiler review but that is my one major,0.019369483
issue with the last Jedi that 20 to 30 minutes that are combined this Finn,0.065752074
storyline now obviously it's not just a 30 minute chunk of the movie it's spread,0.028721964
out over the film but it's one of those things like I said where you're,0.019364161
going back to this place and you're like yeah this could be better pushing all,0.12261996
that aside I honestly love the last Jedi I had a really great time with,0.033058297
this movie I think it has some of the best action sequences in the entire,0.030456763
saga it has some of the best performances in the entire saga it has a,0.02551977
compelling and conflicted villain and it has tons of surprises there are a lot of,0.052478332
things that happen I did not expect I'm not the type of person who likes,0.038991734
to go in speculating though so that could be different for you I don't like,0.02853904
to sit here and make up theories and guess and try to predict things I,0.039936297
like to go in just like I can't wait to experience this I also like,0.02839669
John Williams score this time around more than I did for the force awakens his,0.019652186
music of course is always going to be really good but his score for the,0.029339256
force away was one of my least favorites it just felt a little rushed this,0.06485474
one feels better it's like he had more time let's talk about porks real quick,0.055321995
they're adorable they're amazing and they're not annoying thank God captain tarpals never forget bb-8,0.08146238
once again has a lot of moments to shine Chewie does as well as does,0.031046782
the Millennium Falcon some really awesome Millennium Falcon sequences I honestly love this film I,0.031733252
don't know about where it stands for me but the force awakens I want to,0.041255355
see it again let me see it this Thursday we'll do a spoiler review after,0.032468945
that I think I'll be able to give you my official ranking of where this,0.0242506
fits in but it is a damn good Star Wars movie there are a lot,0.23016481
of emotional moments that I am looking forward to talking to you more about in,0.031979367
the spoiler review if this review seems a little vague it's because I feel like,0.035095755
that's what you would prefer we'll talk more about that after the film is released,0.011473753
but rest assured this movie made me really happy I'm gonna give the last Jedi,0.03955049
and a - definitely better than rogue one I had characters that I actually cared,0.029219521
about a story that felt like it was beginning middle and end made by one,0.0356126
person it didn't feel like an assembly line product it didn't feel like another movie,0.01595044
we've already seen it's structurally its own thing sure there are a few little beats,0.035181563
here and there where you might be like I've seen that before I've seen that,0.025406688
before but this is definitely made by somebody with a unique voice Rian Johnson and,0.032683797
I think he did a damn good job I'm looking forward to seeing it again,0.2843595
I can't wait for you guys to see it thank you so much as always,0.04846129
