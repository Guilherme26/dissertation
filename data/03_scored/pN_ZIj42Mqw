everyone in I am back for my very first criterion collection review man or my,0.107194625
first official a criterion collection review I'm really excited to start this recently I've gotten,0.10183576
sort of into the history and the curation and things of that nature of the,0.05238349
criterion collection I have a small collection of criterion films uh eight I think yes,0.0737998
on DVD but for my personal cartoon review series I'm starting naturally at the very,0.1214461
beginning with spine number one Legrand illusion the 1937 French escape film which I enjoyed,0.020434923
far more than I thought I would I actually sort of started this film a,0.07343419
couple months ago when my friends and I were doing criterion watch along which I,0.09303248
at the time was intrigued by but not too interested in so I actually only,0.06201736
ended up watching one of them even though we had like nine or something that,0.16248879
we went through which was 400 blows which I had to enjoy and obviously off,0.12054624
getting up to that soon because I think that's spine number five but I did,0.06909332
start it I watched a few minutes and I the beginning starts off in just,0.078492485
a French military base and I honestly thought that that's what the whole entire movie,0.07674732
was gonna be I didn't know I think about it I hadn't heard anything I,0.060222883
hadn't read any reviews so I sort of dismissed it and I just closed the,0.06724442
page and I didn't watch anymore so when I restarted it's mine I recommend at,0.10065018
the beginning but then basically right after the point where I'd stopped it transition BAM,0.07134251
straight into a German World War 1 German a prisoner of war camp and I,0.41426182
was surprised and it ended up being a lot better than I thought it would,0.065562025
be um so let's start off with a quick summary the grand illusion follows the,0.05410338
story of the lieutenant Marshall a French sort of working-class guy along with his captain,0.090773344
de boeldieu I don't speak French so sorry I've had butcher the pronunciations and alongside,0.40309066
a group of other prisoner French officers including Rosenthal who becomes one of the more,0.17888941
main characters and it's an escape film they try to get out a couple of,0.07580758
times and in that set of escapes they get sent off to a more high-security,0.09405082
prison that's basically a fortress it's on top of a plateau and it's like a,0.19443
castle it's pretty crazy and it's it's you can just expect when it will be,0.36091658
there's gonna be different clever escape that it's gonna be characters bouncing ideas off of,0.08155875
each other and it's a lot more interesting that I thought it would be so,0.07246128
for the actual review um this movie is a lot funnier and a lot more,0.08796424
not okay not a funny but has a humorous and upbeat tones that I was,0.053284593
not expecting um it's a it's a World War one film it's a war film,0.15205915
but it doesn't have any fighting it's all all of it takes place in prisoner,0.15401965
of war camps with these French officers sort of screwing around and I'm sorry I,0.58526117
think there's someone parking just outside with the radio I don't know if that camera,0.06978765
is getting that but um and they're there they're just a funny group they one,0.07033134
of the guys who I can remember his name is especially just the Joker of,0.10595994
the group and he's always he's always singing and bouncing around and taking the best,0.1351672
of every situation he gets into and he gets into some weird situations and it,0.12833354
it's honestly it makes the movie a lot more a lot more personal and comedic,0.09963463
and shows the best of humanity and alongside that um alongside that hopefulness is the,0.06844365
French pastry Tisza much this movie has a lot of there's a lot of like,0.10458551
in Casablanca weather um all singing and that I'm just being proud of their country,0.066280864
lots of French patriotism which goes along with their their upbeat their positivity and it,0.078396775
it's a french film and you expect that and i honestly thought that it made,0.07564869
the tone a lot more a lot more interesting because i really could have gone,0.08258277
for just a dark and gritty atmosphere for this but really you don't feel depressed,0.23088698
or sad like it's not crushing movie like you could have expected it to be,0.16581945
for a prisoner movie really this movie is also primarily in French obviously but because,0.09046916
it takes place in Germany and there are also prisoners from other countries during the,0.06743627
war as well it switches between French German and occasionally English like few sentences of,0.24169962
English and this is not a knock on the movie but the captions on the,0.10815811
website that I was watching this on could not keep up they kept sort of,0.08288286
switching and people will be talking in French and German and for some reason they,0.15110193
just didn't do the closed caption completely so there might have been a couple lines,0.060543425
that I missed but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the movie so,0.065427296
that's no knock against the movie a couple negatives that I have a fare gushing,0.060268026
so much about the movie is that I really think it starts too quickly as,0.06057991
I said it goes straight from the the French military camp to the prisoner of,0.29184547
war camp within within just seconds like really it's it's about a minute and a,0.17026283
half that switches and I really think it starts too quickly you don't really get,0.0985495
to know the main characters that well you just really learned their relationships throughout the,0.061395757
movie or how they how they interact with each other and that kind of leaves,0.08204156
them feeling connected but not necessarily personalized because you don't know their history don't know,0.07998584
their motives really and I don't know it just a gripe that I have also,0.1380257
another thing is that it's kind of hard to tell how much time passes between,0.07322356
scenes because it sort of just jumps from moment to moment like I've seen will,0.06436295
end just to fade out and then there'll be a newspaper and it could be,0.07383937
like two weeks later or something I don't know interesting but not really bad this,0.09442395
movie just a little bit of trivia as well was the first foreign film to,0.07179237
be nominated for an Oscar it was nominated for Best Picture in 1937 and I,0.054755513
mean that's really quite interesting and it's also the obviously the first film to really,0.074043736
just by the criterion collection again I don't know I know they used to do,0.06268666
laser discs and VHS but I don't know if they did lug around illusion for,0.27936843
the first one of those but it's the first of the DVD blu-ray section of,0.08816457
the criterion collection so little trivia my review I thought it was great surprisingly humorous,0.14468369
has a lot of depth of character and atmosphere and I enjoyed it it's an,0.05470736
8 out of 10 for me I have a few gripes about it which prevent,0.15279718
me from giving a higher score but it is a movie you should see especially,0.13090453
if you want to get into criterion considering it's the first spine and that's it,0.08265473
thank you so much for watching guys they subscribe for more movie reviews my continuing,0.057726417
