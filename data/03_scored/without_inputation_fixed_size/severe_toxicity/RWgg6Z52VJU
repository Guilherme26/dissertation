kind like she meets a boy and it changes her life and then she's able,0.12279024
to go out on her journey and experience great things Lady Bird does meet boys,0.13574669
along the way here one of them played by Lucas hedges but this movie is,0.02684016

gives probably the best performance I've seen from her she is so so drastically real,0.13657285
in this movie and one of the best parts of what Greta Gerwig has done,0.05452843
with her script is that scenes kind of begin they don't feel like they have,0.04379303
a natural beginning like most movie scenes do when you sit down to write a,0.045378827
script sometimes you think about how am I gonna start my scene well we'll have,0.08159808
this logical progression that builds into the moment oftentimes scenes begin in Lady Bird with,0.050251964
characters mid-conversation and you're like what were they just talking about well it doesn't matter,0.04909388
because we're now observing this moment and the moments are so well realized because the,0.011135174
scenes just come about that technique keeps this film feeling so raw the film also,0.02450603
has a really great balance of portraying our lead character at this religious school that,0.021498736
she's going to and it's making it hard on her she wants to blossom she,0.11586102
wants to do a lot with her life but there's a lot of restrictions there,0.045524504
normally when films have a character at a Catholic school or something very strict like,0.026138391
that they portray it as this big negative like a really horrible time in their,0.05918272
life where they weren't able to follow their dreams this movie sidesteps that and presents,0.09476406
it as simply not necessarily a roadblock but just something that Lady Bird has to,0.030924387
deal with it doesn't say you shouldn't go to Catholic school it doesn't say like,0.076979704
don't believe in these things because it's hard on you it just shows moments it,0.042748693
feels like you're watching contained moments throughout this character's life which the best coming-of-age stories,0.031803094

of them really strong work there is not a weak link in regards to the,0.019057512
actors here the film also balances the right amount of embarrassment with realism there's so,0.07005248
many scenes here where you just cringe for the lead character but it's not awkward,0.058959216
in the way that some films do when it comes off kind of pretentious like,0.058636602
hey look at this really awkward character we wrote aren't they so unique and different,0.038266018
and weird aren't I a great writer Greta Gerwig really does a great job to,0.03607025
avoid all of those cliches I'd be curious to know how much of the film,0.059072964
is improvised because the dialogue flows so naturally between actors I found myself really caring,0.011082625
about these characters I was wrapped up in their lives and I was honestly concerned,0.073255345
about them I felt like I wanted to befriend them and be like it's okay,0.15706715
