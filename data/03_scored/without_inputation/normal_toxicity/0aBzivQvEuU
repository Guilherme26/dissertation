"Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign to secure equal voting rights through an epic 1965 demonstration in Selma, Alabama. In what is easily his biggest and most daunting role yet, David Oyelowo portrays the influential civil rights leader with a quiet determination... that bursts into loud oratory during his famous and forceful speeches. Although a majority of the PG-13 rated story is very historically accurate, DuVernay actually had to write new variations of these speeches, since another studio already purchased the rights to the real ones. Even still, when Oyelowo defiantly declares to an enraptured congregation, ""Our lives are not fully lived",0.0970919

"but by opening the picture with it, the larger-than-life figure is immediately humanized and relatable. Ejogo isn't featured as much as I would have liked, but she delivers a powerful performance when she questions her husband on his infidelity.",0.11467352
"Tom Wilkinson has a significant role as President Johnson and his transformation from reluctance to acceptance is a rewarding thing to witness. Andrew Holland, Giovanni Ribisi, Wendell Pierce, Common, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tim Roth, Oprah Winfrey, Stephen Root, and Martin Sheen round out the awesomely talented and familiar supporting cast.

"The sad reality is how relevant this narrative still is, a half-century later. Voter suppression, racism, and police brutality plague our society even today. That being said, as a movie proper, it lacks a personal depth to really be effective. Characters are being obfuscated and marginalized, but they're not people we actually care about. The requisite ""where are they now"" on-screen text that closes out the film literally introduces us to a new character, only to kill her off in the same sentence.
