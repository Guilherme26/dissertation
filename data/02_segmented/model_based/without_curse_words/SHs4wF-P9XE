"Hey guys, this lady, I wanted to give you a quick movie review"
"Uh, double indemnity"
"Uh, is the movie and it stars Um, and First of all, it's a great movie"
This is a great
Um
"Keep you on the edge of your seat, Um, a mystery"
"It stars Uh Fred Mcmurray, Barbara Stanwick and Uh Edward G"
Robinson
"It came out in 1944 and it was nominated for all kind of Oscars and probably almost ever all of the major categories, And then didn't win one"
And that's a shame
"although honestly I don't know who the competition was, so I can't"
really
I got to be fair about that
"so basically um, as Fred Mcmurray's character is an insurance salesman and he does pretty good for himself"
He's a regular guy
Nothing spectacular and special
"None stands out for him, just regular guy working"
"and he works in this office, And Edward G Robinson's character is the insurance manager, the claims manager of the office, and he can spot a phony claim"
"You know, a mile away"
"he's he claims, He always says this little man inside his, his, his instincts inside, He can tell when it just makes him sick when he sees some when he sees a claim come before him And it's not It's phony"
"You know, someone's trying to build the Uh, the office"
So he
"actually, we actually see that, uh, a a gentleman in the office and he was trying to"
you know
it looked like he deliberately set his car on fire to get you know insurance money
"whatever, And uh he"
he's You know
he has sent somebody over there to check it out and he's really good with that
"So you know, So he"
His character is very integral to the plot
"So anyway, you know um, Fred Mcmurray's character"
"Uh, his name is uh, Um, Walter Nuff, neff, I guess neff"
"So he, you know, he's kept going about his merry way and he's uh, you know, selling his insurance and he goes to a house where they have let their insurance lapse, So he's going there to get the renewal, and he meets Um Barbra Stanwy's character, Phyllis, And you know she's this beautiful beautiful woman seducting"
"You know, very seductive seduct, just a seductress And she's coming"
She comes out in the towel and you know she's like
"Oh, what do you want you know? And she, you know, she's like scoping him out"
"Although he's flirting with her, he has no idea what she's got cooking in her in her little pretty little head, so Um, basically I'm gonna give away some spoilers, but not all the spoilers"
"I'm not going to spoil the entire thing because to really enjoy this movie, you know, you have to, um, kind of"
Um
"If you've never seen it before, you have to"
really
"you know, the mystery of it is what is just so fascinating"
"First of all, the acting is magnificent"
It's a shame before God
"I don't know who won the Best supporting actor Oscar in 1944, But Edward G"
Everett G
Robinson should have won
For sure
He is brilliant
"as Um keys, the claims adjuster, Uh, the claims, the claims manager, He is brilliant"
His acting is brilliant in this film
So they meet up
"He finds out that she's not that happy with her marriage, and basically uh, she wants to kill her husband, And you know at first he's not really that fond of going along with it like you know"
I don't know
"That sounds a little crazy, but after a while he decides to go along with it, so they plot to kill her husband and he encounters, Um"
"So they, you know they, they scheme, and they, you know, whatever, all that type of stuff, And he has a daughter that lives there, Um with them, And you know she's not that faith"
She's nothing
she's crazy about
"Um, that's actually a stepmom, not her mom that lives there, So her mom actually passed away, and Phyllis, who is currently the wife is, was the the mother's nurse"
"So you know, and then you know, So she didn't like her from the beginning, So she has questions"
She has doubts
she has thoughts that she
"This woman could have possibly had something to do with her mom's work on my murder, but death, so um, it just starts to you know, Th this thing takes up speed like a snowball"
"It just it just goes and goes and goes, and then the stuff just starts unraveling on them"
And then I mean all kind of twists and turns
This is
"this is a brilliant acting, brilliant directing, brilliant writing"
"this, these, the um"
"the, the um"
The dialogue between Keys and Walter Neff is brilliant
It's brilliant
as he slowly uncovers things about the case
He is brilliant
She is brilliant
"Uh, Phyllis is just she's so evil"
It's just it's like this lady is too easygoing
"You know for what's going on? So anyway, guys, I recommend this movie"
It is on a prime video right now

"Um what I do now, Guys with the covey"
"You know, I have this ritual It kind of takes me back to"
"If any of you guys remember, Like Hollywood video Blockbuster video, You know all those video stores, some of them still around"

"If any of you guys watched it, I want to say thank you first of all"
"Secondly, I"
S
"I made an error, Um, Jimmy Cagne, I think I said Jim, James Cagney was in that movie"
