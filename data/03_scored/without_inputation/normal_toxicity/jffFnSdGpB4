hey everybody today i am going to be reviewing dunkirk this film came out in 2017,0.18355362
it was written and directed by christopher nolan at this point in his career nolan had become a bona fide kind of blockbuster auteur and we really don't have many of those nowadays but it gave him a lot of freedom and a lot of creative control,0.078782566
and i think this film it seems to be a labor of love for him,0.15617402
because he came up with the idea over two decades ago in the mid-90s when he was sailing up the english channel where a lot of the evacuations had taken place at dunkirk,0.08288636
i think he really wanted to be ambitious,0.12473071
but in a way that is very different,0.037002016
from how he's been ambitious in the past,0.08034207
he pushed himself ironically into restraint,0.11525914
and i think that's a really hard thing to do for a hollywood director to accept and be willing to do to push themselves but i have to hand it to him he did go out of his comfort zone for this one,0.16574012
and he wrote a super concise script which is a lot shorter than i think anything else,0.09413206
he's ever done,0.09906777
he wanted to use a lot of the elements of his cinematic philosophy that he's used throughout his career,0.089247175
but just in a different way where he's stripping all of the elements of the story back the exposition the character motivations,0.0354727
so that the tension and the climactic build of everything becomes the focus,0.06036461
so it's an experiment in tension building normally,0.18427294
a lot of that would take place in the third act of a film and especially in nolan films,0.10145497
that's certainly what happens in his third acts,0.12132135
but here he's kind of stretching it into a feature length experience,0.07640729
slightly different approach,0.05624043
but familiar ideas now of course those of you who watch my channel regularly know that i uh famously or infamously,0.34114274
i'm not a fan of christopher nolan and a lot of people really fume over my criticisms of his work which i find amusing but i think that you might misinterpret me a little bit,0.24232048
i think people distort what i say and turn it into this really dramatic thing,0.28868523
but i don't hate him,0.21521646
i don't think that he's an untalented person quite the contrary,0.62897074
i think he has a lot of talent,0.112281494
but i would agree that yes i am quite tough on him,0.11568876
maybe tougher on him than i am certain directors and i'm similar with people like darren aronofsky for example people love to say oh you just don't get him or oh you're just trying to be edgy with a different type of opinion,0.16120256
and it's like come on give me some credit,0.16902217
i am tough on him because i always thought that he had the capacity to truly be great if he could just bring out some of his strengths over here,0.1678907
maybe tame some weaknesses here he could truly make something balanced and something really great but over and over and over again he falls short for me,0.08313488
and that's just my opinion,0.056090996
but it is really frustrating,0.09932351
for me as a viewer but i actually think that this film in particular dunkirk is the perfect film to reflect on my frustrations throughout his career,0.0696701
and how he's learned to work with them and reign them in and gain a little bit of perspective on them so that he could reach this peak,0.17252733
because this film ladies and gentlemen is a nolan film that i actually liked a lot i think truly nolan is nearly reaching his his potential here his potential as an artist just as a storyteller as a filmmaker as a technician my key problems with nolan have been less about his philosophy and more just about the execution of it,0.2698378
and if we go back to memento which of course is one of his very first films he lays out his philosophy on film,0.14971149
and just the idea of what he's interested in so it would be kind of memory and dreams how that affects film,0.14665018
what is true,0.04381041
what is an illusion,0.10234378
what is manipulation,0.15405358
and how does all of that affect the narrative and our experience viewing the narrative and i do enjoy memento i think it is quite unique and interesting but at the same time i still struggle maybe not with the ideas because i do think they're quite provocative and ambitious but just in the execution which is built around this gimmick,0.08106591
you know the idea of of doing the narrative in reverse,0.09203963
and while i like the idea of that just that construct to kind of express the thematic intention and just the film's philosophy but it's done just you know in a very literal way that really lacks true maturity and complexity that i felt that he had in him even back then but i could forgive it because it was an early work,0.06858649
then he goes on in his career and the films become more about making the construct idea the technical building blocks to create the illusion in a way that to me kind of bogs down the rest of the film in a lot of wordy exposition and it feels kind of just like a convoluted chess match i'm thinking about movies like interstellar and of course films like inception which many people do argue that it is a masterpiece,0.11494721
but i've always kind of leaned in the direction of feeling that it's more artificially cerebral than it actually is convincingly cerebral,0.5154597
nolan loves to explore the mechanics of filmmaking the mechanics of narrative structure and how to invert them,0.14781505
so we're getting a unique perspective on it,0.062591635
but it just it kind of feels again like a gimmick very disjointed to me the masters of cinema especially the people that look at dreams and its effect on the cinematic language and i'm meaning like the wells of the world the bertrand vanillas the uh the david lynch's when they are at their best they are effortless in terms of weaving the mechanics into the illusion,0.17772259
it's not labored or overwrought or clunky with its metaphors,0.23277673
it's just easing in to me,0.1002591
it reminds me of like before you're baking something and you're folding cream into a bowl,0.25766385
there's a technique to it but they're they're really allowing all of that to happen more organically with with maturity dunkirk is exploring tension cinematically,0.15038176
but it's also exploring time it's exploring story structure in a way that is clear and that is focused,0.058087643
but in a way where it is interwoven with the experience,0.07877778
seamlessly nolan is exploring triptych structure in a narrative sense with this movie so he's using three different timelines three different narratives that all are going to intersect climactically three different points of view of the allied forces,0.08105913
so the first one would be soldiers evacuating the beaches at dunkirk,0.12540753
and i think this is supposed to take place over about a week's time then you have a story of a civilian,0.16028032
uh father and son who are on a boat that takes place over a course of a day and then you get the point of view from the pilots in the air and that i think takes place over the course of an hour so it's a trifold sort of thing but it's designed in a way again where everything is building almost like a like a symphony,0.11424605
even though all the timelines are quite different,0.050906703
it's edited in a way where the climax is building harmoniously and to do that is really difficult,0.07058045
but it's done,0.051174194
meticulously here perfectly balanced but it all fits in line with his philosophies that we saw even in memento about how memory and emotional entanglement can sort of distort and shift the meaning of certain situations,0.100748576
and we see here how editing can really manipulate time regardless of the timelines of the three different stories they all feel like they're happening at the same time in the same amount of time and it feels very real and very raw to me because in very tense situations in life or death situations there's all kinds of things that happen strange coincidences,0.068465315
the people that you meet in the heat of battle that you never knew them,0.15009178
you don't know their background yet sharing this very visceral experience that very few people get to share can change your perceptions of that person,0.1357635
and and change your perceptions of the event everything in this movie feels immediate partially because of the way that it's shot for the most part you're really only seeing the point of view of the people we're following,0.15171108
so the edges of the frame are limited for us as well as the point of view of the actual characters themselves,0.060759135
the cinematography really focuses on the detail something really intense in a face in the foreground while everything else is kind of in in soft focus which gives us that paranoia,0.12905166
but we it's like we feel everything,0.058937006
and we're present with the character on screen as though we're in their personal space,0.04354381
it's very intimate,0.1839657
but then you contrast that with a lot of the shots in the air which is really giving us that that special perspective,0.065844856
these sweeping beautiful,0.19052258
shots in deep focus are really spectacular very reminiscent of like a david lean film lawrence of arabia and the film has a very modern feel to it as though it's not rooted in any timeline even though it is recalling specific events in the past,0.060265046
it is true to nolan in that sense that it's minimalistic the mison scene is minimalistic,0.16248566
and just the experience of watching the film was very unique,0.04013104
and i really responded to it it felt like a blend of different directors techniques,0.06536915
it had that that tension and the climactic build of like a an action film a really good,0.07166481
one like mad max the sweep and that kind of introspection of like a a david lean film and yet it has that methodical kind of technical approach that you might get from a a stanley kubrick,0.18729343
i can't tell you how happy i am to see how skeletal the script is which really goes in line with the aesthetic of the rest of the film if there's one thing that i have always struggled with maybe the maybe the most with nolan it was always his dialogue nolan dialogue,0.05469547
for me has often felt really just expository needlessly expository and overly wordy where the subtext is just spilled out for us on the surface rather than us doing any of the heavy lifting and it just feels amateurish,0.111492835
and yes i do feel like a lot of his actors and in his his ensemble of characters in his movies they do feel more like pawns in a chess game rather than real characters which actually can be great,0.14403796
i think that's really worked in the past,0.03767037
i'm thinking about a movie like nocturama by bertrand vanilla as an example,0.16392818
but here again it always felt a little disjointed and gimmicky but not here the dialogue is kept to a minimum in dunkirk,0.09899047
let's not use empathy or get into the politics of war or any of that because i think it's it's really unnecessary to this story,0.10742055
this is kind of a perfect cut of meat right here with no no gristle and yes in a way they still the characters in this movie still do feel like chess pieces that are functioning to explore the cinematic structure,0.08872727
but again here it just feels more authentic more sophisticated,0.063016
where the intents are clear but we let that take a back seat to the experience itself so that all the elements can come together and bloom rather than just breaking the flow as they so often do for me,0.06881906
it is a very unique type of war film one of the best war films i've seen in a really long time the realism and everything i do appreciate about nolan and always have how he insists on doing everything as much as he can for real without relying too much on cgi and it really really is effective,0.10221886
now of course any film auteur typically the big ones have a frequent composer that they like to collaborate with in the case of nolan that would be hans zimmer and as many of you know i'm not a fan of hans zimmer and i've been quite vocal about that but i'm less kind to han zimmer than i am uh christopher nolan and a lot of people disagree my struggles with zimmer are actually quite similar to my issues with nolan over time for me zimmer when he's composing,0.07139814
he's always tackling,0.09627092
what is the most literal most abrasive aspects of tension building really heavy,0.1274615
percussion going straight for the jugular type of soundscapes that overwhelm to me rather than enhance,0.18635844
i feel like i'm drowning in the sound for a lot of those films rather than allowing it to kind of color,0.28163755
the world create a frame around it to be able to express things through complex instrumentation and melody but no it's just it's harsh heavy minimalism without any intellect however i didn't hate this one i i wish it had been better,0.108288996
i wish it were more on the level of the film itself but i do respect hans zimmer for actually being more restrained a lot like nolan,0.061391186
he's repressing those natural urges and going more for the the minimalism for the subtlety and the instrumentation drawing out the tension here,0.08773782
and i actually think that ironically some of that heaviness actually works well for this particular film just because yeah you know you're surrounded by like this drowning heavy metallic feeling which really serves being surrounded by all these machines and like these giant boats tipping over and being shot at but at the same time i can't help wishing that no one would go for a composer that yeah still has that minimalism and that modern edge to him but had more light and shade and could experiment more with with sound textures more somebody like mika levy,0.17424382
i think would be really perfect for a film like this,0.07511612
but i'm really nitpicking here,0.058749434
i don't hate the score,0.09409869
i just wish it had been a little more elevated like the rest of the film,0.07694133
and if i had any other complaints it would be just i know i said i i appreciate how stripped back the dialogue is but there are points that it still feels a little bit too expository having the kenneth branagh character be just kind of his sole purpose there is to be the person to give us exposition,0.09815785
and the way that it was handled at the end felt a little bit too neat and tidy but again those are minor issues that i have i really like i said before i really liked this film,0.07277912
and i didn't expect to i had never seen it until very very recently,0.08152862
and i think it really gets better after multiple viewings,0.056808613
but i live for these moments where a filmmaker that i know has always been so close and just hasn't reached that potential is finally getting somewhere where they're really refining their taste,0.08408797
and becoming a true master of their craft and that that's what i've seen here and looking back at nolan you know it hasn't always been an easy journey for me but i think with this film it really is worth it,0.08241186
and that is my review,0.06241212
