and she said incredible life friends family plays hockey everything's great until her whole life,0.07339636
is upturned by her moving to San Francisco and the movie instead of just being,0.013775288
you know drama about a normal girl as it is Pixar we've got to do,0.063936785
something interesting we've got to do something personified and so this movie is not about,0.025356136
Riley so much as it is about Riley's emotions Riley's brain the five emotions inside,0.07633381
her head that our joy sadness anger disgust and fear and through this you could,0.26698342
see how these emotions interact and how they influence one another which kind of makes,0.026230186
up how our brain chemistry works and its really really interesting take on how we,0.050187442
are able to make our own decisions and how the memories that we have in,0.00945492
our past affect us and how we forget things and our imagination and just so,0.009095721
many many incredible ideas that really make this film one of the best animated movies,0.021284547
to come out in a long long time now I've been disillusioned with Pixar for,0.07467152
a little bit because in my personal opinion I really haven't loved any of their,0.080390766
movies since 2006 I think cars is an absolute masterpiece in every single movie they,0.044086378
made before that was an absolute masterpiece ratatouille was the first one where was like,0.05793151
yeah it was okay and all the other ones really just weren't that memorable toy,0.1463996
story 3 notwithstanding of course so when people were acting oh my god pit inside,0.062435467
outs coming out in my mind it was like this looks really great I love,0.11880579
the concept and the premise and I was like you know what I feel like,0.013045582
Pixar's back and my opinion this is their comeback for me I like they've had,0.04727593
a dry spell for a while and I'm just as excited for the next movie,0.026095819
the good dinosaur but to focus in on inside out this movie is incredible it,0.0501768
is so well done I think it's probably at least in their top three of,0.02597143
greatest films that they've made first off the animation itself was just beautiful I love,0.09817711
how the emotions in the film look like they're made out of like this sort,0.030460754
of fuzzy sparkly kind of like imaginative you know brain matter or whatever the first,0.23858288
emotion that dough that is in somebody's head is a shot that Riley as a,0.17078324
child her mind is joy and when joy shows up she only has one button,0.101276204
the press and that's just flat because there's nothing else on this like this is,0.032475594
tiny little control panel and that's it didn't like little parts of her mind will,0.09610507
start appearing and it's like the brain is starting to develop itself core memories the,0.09349888
things that really make you a person the train of thought which a meat which,0.09108626
made me chuckle immediately as soon as they said there was a train of thought,0.07251566
I took a second and I got it the tracks disappear and literally that they,0.080175914
is described by another character as oh it just kind of goes all over the,0.009189512
place um besides the animation itself all the voice acting is great Amy Poehler just,0.045914967
completely its best role ever I've seen her and she's so good as joy and,0.026999803
her relationship with sadness was really interesting Mindy Kaling is really really entertaining is discussed,0.044869963
liked her much more than I thought I would and of course Lewis Black is,0.040387955
just completely perfect casting as anger who i'm sure all the kids loved when he,0.12119845
his head catches on fire my favorite character in the film was actually fear i,0.07997437
thought he was really really well done and kind of an underused player in all,0.019570367
of this bill hader plays him expertly part of joy and sadness adventure takes them,0.059146136
to dream productions which is at night when Riley goes to sleep there's this movie,0.024154149
studio that puts on these shows and they are watched by only one thing which,0.024728866
is fear ever anger disgust everything else is asleep except fear he stays awake okay,0.0782848
and he's just sitting there watching these things that basically it's just it's just hidden,0.041830737
reacting whether he gets afraid or not and it's just like him gone oh yeah,0.06447625
this is boring oh she's a bad actress blah blah and it was app that,0.22115827
was my favorite scene in the movie by far it was not just because it,0.024061022
was funny it was just so clever and the way they were doing it on,0.039392177
how like everybody was being played by like a thought figment of her imagination and,0.038623888
then they put on a rat reality distortion filter over the lens and it just,0.09492503
looks like they're all people uh and it was it was funny I also like,0.032925926
how they have a little bit they have a little joke about film predictability where,0.058735717
they were fears just going oh yeah her pants are probably going to be down,0.15115234
isn't it Oh yep fan sir down that was it's just the things that these,0.028197134
people must have thought up when they were coming up with this movie they must,0.038906593
have had a ball with it there is a really really powerful subplot or may,0.051137988
perhaps the main plot which is the joys relationship with sadness and how you would,0.05046083
imagine those two don't get along and how joy just really doesn't understand sadness she,0.044933822
doesn't understand her purpose why is she here of course and her mind said this,0.042081513
should just you know not really exist why should a person be sad and sadness,0.08451624
also doesn't really understand who she is or why she exists and that whole relationship,0.033409514
and the the coming to understand each other is a huge core of the film,0.06399466
and that and that of course at a time in a girl's life where she,0.096351855
is moving dealing with all these emotions joy and sadness are struggling with each other,0.010809234
that's exactly what would happen it's the exact point in time where an adventure such,0.036434103
of this would occur in her head we're both joy and sadness kind of become,0.16043098
lost to you know anger and fear and disgust and it totally makes sense during,0.11742487
a fight between these two characters they accidentally become lost somewhere in the confines of,0.04809278
Riley's brain and they must work their way through it try and find their way,0.19525336
back to the control center where they can try and make Riley happy again some,0.016977482
kids would see it as just a interesting fantasy adventure about these personified emotions but,0.075095244
it's actually a really really deep story and a really really interesting take on you,0.03897577
know the way a person reacts to change and the way kids sometimes have to,0.020549519
act a certain way in front of their parents versus the way they would act,0.04050769
in front of other people what would cause certain things to happen such as why,0.035903286
do you start crying in the middle of happy memory sometimes because it's nostalgic and,0.04842138
sad because you just don't have the thing more and they explore all these different,0.04584246
aspects of it and that was really interesting to be honest a lot of the,0.012644476
emotions were totally different than I thought they were going to be a particularly fear,0.056261897
instead of you know just being afraid of everything he's trying to keep Riley safe,0.031466514
no matter what he's trying to help her he's not actually a very unhappy person,0.07387995
her constantly afraid as I thought he would be he just has a tendency to,0.113542855
become afraid most of maybe he's just being cautious he's just trying to be you,0.04448083
know helpful and I really really like that I thought that was really interesting similarly,0.028785158
anger isn't just this villain one of the best things about this movie is that,0.060009543
they don't go that route and they don't take emotions like anger or sadness or,0.03717379
fear and they make them villains there is no villain in this movie and that,0.042554457
is one of the best things about it it's that the the real enemy is,0.039203927
just life and the problems we encounter like there's no enemy to fight there's no,0.034211062
bad guy to defeat there's just a situation that you need to overcome which is,0.048523817
that's the way life is there's no enemy there's no no one you can point,0.030403549
the finger at except this is just the things we're going through and I think,0.05264862
that that's one of the most powerful things about it and I love that and,0.020461049
of course where the story goes ends up being really interesting of joy coming to,0.0150145255
terms with sadnesses existence and satisfying a purpose and it was really really really beautiful,0.064713724
and really really interesting and it just all came up and wrapped together in this,0.052532878
little bow and when I won't finish the movie I'm like that was perfect All,0.10388905
