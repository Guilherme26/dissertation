here's a bold statement I think Wonder Woman as a film is better than you,0.09904784
think it is that applies even if it's your favorite movie ever made I think,0.021560598
I still might make you like even more however if it's your least favorite movie,0.03231728
of all time hopefully you will gain a new found respect for something I like,0.06106785
to call the fetch this son of Adana crap spelunky what didn't didn't we have,0.5855324
a meeting where I said I'm just gonna quote this off my phone here even,0.038403712
as the temporary name I am NOT okay with calling the secret sauce about Wonder,0.03259932
Woman the fetch ness and quote what is happening to my show used to be,0.131417
so fetch [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Wonder Woman a movie all about the fetch miss is,0.026520208
a 2017 film directed by patty Jenkins written by Allan Heinberg with a story created,0.03345142
by Zack Snyder someone we're gonna be talking about a whole lot in this piece,0.046756424
Allan Heinberg and Jason fuse Heinberg is known for his work on Grey's Anatomy The,0.01578747
OC Sex in the City and party of five whereas fuchs wrote ice age continental,0.3932674
drift in a scripting the upcoming minecraft the movie Zack Snyder is known most recently,0.049055297
for this and this two films that tie directly into this and something we're gonna,0.05313886
come back to and this isn't the easiest film to talk about but I'm gonna,0.029019967
avoid colloquial burps like it wasn't a perfect movie because no movie is perfect if,0.12683389
movies were perfect we couldn't relate to them I mean one woman is like 500,0.0732753
different things all at once it's a wonderful fish out of water story a gorgeous,0.038130987
World War 1 film a whimsical dissection of mythology as it pertains to like reality,0.14911422
while being the truest vision of a DC character that actually represents the superhero worshiped,0.017812952
by hundreds of millions of people as she actually is not randomly a horrible murderer,0.34512505
you know like the rest of them diana is compassionate and kind and wants to,0.015585253
believe that people are good and ultimately worth saving like she's not exactly at home,0.051422022
and the taps tree she currently resides in which is something I want to lean,0.039698824
on really close this piece the cinematic world surrounding Diana is chaos unmistakable chaos the,0.040371325
architect of this current cinematic cluster verse is very clearly this dude and frankly Batman,0.05913017
V Superior sand then Justice League was God an unknown who has explained in one,0.042155348
word what the tone of Justice Lee was I will wait here and I'm actually,0.023422446
saying is if you're patty Jenkins who I hopefully don't need to explain why the,0.055288736
pressure of her finding success here was monumental was to use a football metaphor trying,0.023917343
to kick a field goal while the goalpost is tell appeared but it first might,0.20269875
appear like odd design choices ie the bad guys in this film who I admit,0.048682794
are so strange but when you realize that those design choices were made to fit,0.014896123
into Zack Snyder's Cinematic Universe in a way where they work at any toned because,0.034292214
literally two disparate movies that sandwich this like pick a tone so pretend that you're,0.05992972
fighting with one hand tied behind your back and you can lose this fight you,0.18754986
lose this for what inescapably represents a lot more than just you air-ground visually there's,0.05425371
a lot of reasons for this this is kind of an idea we've only invented,0.05597587
since marvel this idea of the the pressure of making a superhero movie is actually,0.014063313
far worse than it used to be you're not just making a good Wonder Woman,0.105483495
movie anymore this isn't 1990 all you're making a vertically integrated superhero film that must,0.023787633
share compatibility with what has come before it and and what which comes after it,0.040012125
because it's 2017 it god help us this stupid idiotic social network hell that we,0.6233062
have imprisoned ourselves with is the same hell mistake that allows marketers to gain the,0.12387316
confidence to pull off things like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and more Star Wars this,0.029578056
film is a half-court shot with your eyes closed let's take a moment for the,0.2919119
shared universe guillotine that fell Edgar Wright Phil Lord Christopher Miller and Colin Trevorrow and,0.08552066
that's one hundred percent not a comment on any of those artists I've said amazingly,0.034886885
nice things about literally all of them but it is a comment on this system,0.028557664
that couldn't shift to accommodate them in the ways that they as artists needed the,0.021553945
tightrope is skinnier than it appears so when someone succeeds let alone breaks the mold,0.0711068
that contained it yeah you poor patty Jenkins another beer because hot damn my friend,0.53889257
you accomplished so many unseen goals beyond the ones that people already give you much,0.059432827
due credit for this success cannot be undersold actually here's how hard not to undersell,0.04433316
at 821 million dollars worldwide justice league is at 572 Justice League with six times,0.021214036
the superheroes including our titular hero undersell did it did it undersold it okay but,0.031039465
simply it is holy God everybody involved in this movie swung for the parking lot,0.07260546
how can we add modernity to this classic genre the first thing was meeting with,0.02892285
each of them and talking about okay here is the story that we are hunkering,0.038484864
in on telling on this the inspiration I've got to say of the design of,0.0302459
all of the armor and all of the world was the whisker I've tried to,0.024944387
grow it out of the Wonder Woman costume used in Batman vs Superman so taking,0.05538319
all the style lines taking all the information in that one costume inspired all of,0.053073008
the others so whether they're the Queen or whether they're a soldier there's a hint,0.0290499
of the Wonder Woman hostile in all of them like everybody very early on patty,0.17155685
and I talked about a portrait painter of the time of World War one John,0.052463032
Singer Sargent and he actually had we would consider a very modern approach to using,0.022317577
light in his portraits and a lot of that was very soft frontal three-quarter light,0.0664432
that quickly fell in the blackness beyond the character and that painting style sort of,0.036217254
dictated a lot of how I approach lighting the faces like everybody everybody there we,0.08250073
have them literally hundreds of designs for this before we got it we got it,0.050102297
down this with the chosen god killer the serpent has chosen for dinosaur the animal,0.2778288
was chosen just because of its look it's fierce it just gives off that vibe,0.06922167
that they want her to be that way it's a strong fierce god something in,0.052548844
the region of 38 locations across two countries because the UK nice thing that really,0.03703144
helped to me anchor how we would introduce different imagery into the shields or the,0.04121345
salt and we basically came up with the design that would go through each the,0.017802974
craftsmanship on everything you get the palpable and believable feeling that everyone working on this,0.049116496
believed they were working on something important and were they had the design thermos scan,0.03597513
Ferrara wait what is amiss the muscaria the mascara got it you know that first,0.08275816
try one take you know the place where the gods made their trial run civilization,0.06702324
also a world war one movie of grandeur and scope oh and it's a superhero,0.16479792
movie where alas those make people tell the truth made the lasso thing great what,0.0694944
the hell is this thing huh the Cloverfield episode add Superman in it and then,0.28935868
I did a Batman episode now a Wonder Woman episode that's like planning or something,0.023845503
also I just have a lot of things to say about DC superheroes and it,0.026559453
is a telling statement that I believe one of their main three houses is actually,0.008008146
in order I'm continually baffled by the scope of this thing here's an interesting thought,0.02091803
Wonder Woman is a world war 1 movie for I believe two reasons one it,0.14786834
puts Wonder Woman far enough away from the justice bro verse that you can sort,0.04548326
of avoid the flying bug monster pitfalls I mean Diana is actually fighting humans which,0.12919596
does make a difference if you came for the pun the punch fights or to,0.060808428
watch Diana knee this dude at a window - from an outside perspective World War,0.15906337
1 was the moment the world really started going down the path it is currently,0.01849144
on think about it what if you're an alien species that chooses to visit when,0.22408421
some large percentage of the world is embroiled in a thirty-two country conflict that claimed,0.05794614
the lives of some 17 million people which is really fertile soil to plant Diana's,0.05034376
roots in because here's a fun bit of trivia what other World War 1 movies,0.12498934
can you name I'll knock out a few there was Lawrence of Arabia a very,0.08177768
long engagement which I loved warhorse James Franco was in that movie you definitely forgot,0.13079706
about about fly boys yeah it can be slimmer pickins with that particular war which,0.13441233
i think makes the decision interesting it's period piece wrapped in a period piece and,0.06828177
I even talked about the movie yet I've just talked about the hoopla surrounding it,0.024021776
so let's get to [Applause] this movie is about a billion things that all add,0.01706196
up into one really beautiful new superhero thing and if you need to use the,0.03511837
restroom go now because this segment is the longest one I've ever done the show,0.026286727
last chance here we go the film opens in modern day immediately using Diana to,0.015581927
push us into a flashback explaining the birth of the Amazons also this elongated zoom,0.08836233
for meta earth level all the way to a shot that ends perfectly above the,0.18909109
Louvre pyramid is a super dope way to open her film so Bruce Wayne sends,0.11306858
Diana a photograph in the present day she has been searching for basically her entire,0.055729087
adult demigod life as it represents the moment she came alive as a being with,0.18024415
purpose and he uses his unlimited unearned well to track it down for her which,0.08738252
triggers a flashback of this entire story and is why we opened in Amazon on,0.06542613
a girl molded out of clay by her mother and breathed her life by Zeus,0.3245246
after her mother begged him to on an island filled with demigod women that is,0.25054651
perpetually training for supposed to eminent war they never questioned the validity of which also,0.044540696
was against Ares the God of War but not that one also when Diana's mother,0.078502975
was surprised that her totally alone clay child was inspired by the militaristic display she,0.07181722
is inundated with 24/7 and was like oh no my daughter we live in a,0.057930842
society ruled by literally one purpose how ever has that purpose affected oh I might,0.045033596
faint fast-forward to Diana actually training because she's secretly a weapon called the god killer,0.340875
spoilers a super subtle sounding superhero name that is in no way as cool as,0.031098
Wonder Woman can she just go by that for a little bit um the god,0.19030371
the god killer one for me two things happen in rapid succession Diana realizes that,0.19689369
she is a weapon which brings up a whole host of new questions about agency,0.13286445
in a system that empowers people with a boatload of responsibility without their consent to,0.067143634
do so but that's more of a superhero problem at large from top to bottom,0.06894629
very much not specifically a wonder one problem so we're gonna table that one for,0.027966982
a second anyway this is where Steve Trevor and a whole host of German soldiers,0.19415712
come through this wormhole energy gotta energy shield thing and a big fight scene ensues,0.12736271
that takes a lot of lives between the bows and the guns and is our,0.112279005
first real visual clue that Diana isn't necessarily on board with any side of this,0.009854031
conflict diana is her own person something this movie is very much about as well,0.13940254
as its intended message empower each other speak truth to power which sometimes needs to,0.027278516
be spoken on the knuckles of perfect fists a point tough to argue in a,0.15254258
war film as her methods are downright civilized by comparison she fights for something not,0.07151057
against something let me tell you a story when I was finding out what I,0.022208486
wanted to say with this my friend Lili yes the same Lili friend from The,0.041935172
Iron Giant episode lose me and on this article here is everything about the meta,0.035033893
story of the movie and the point of this movie illustrated in a single story,0.017577479
and in a fun side note in tracking the story down as it appeared on,0.042096145
many websites who was originally run as a piece slash interview with patty Jenkins from,0.046625383
Fandango of all sites and it's about the no man's land scene you might be,0.02853904
saying to yourself hang on Michael isn't that the best scene in the movie yes,0.093322605
and it's entirely incidental to the central plot and I will remind you that the,0.063519716
central plot is irrelevant to this film killing Ares the God of War has no,0.25590476
effect on war still occurring the ultimate goal of this film has no purpose humans,0.15621173
are just bad the movie says all you can really do at the end of,0.054864347
the day is empower each other speak truth to power and stand up to the,0.026464997
injustice a--'s that you see in the world so when studio executives gave confused notes,0.028960101
most likely pointing out that this serve no narrative purposes it was in no way,0.023671225
related to her core mission identifying kill Ares patty fought for it she said and,0.29997492
I am quoting this is a scene about her becoming Wonder Woman she isn't fighting,0.068736084
anyone Diana becomes Wonder Woman in a scene where she doesn't directly fight anyone it,0.07497418
was apparently a little confusing to shoot because everyone kept asking yes but who is,0.094396874
she fighting she becomes Wonder Woman when she isn't hitting people being a superhero doesn't,0.12209113
mean hitting people all the time bat man its narrative expendable but it's thematically irreplaceable,0.24481018
this scene in this movie moving on name an authority figure in this movie who,0.050442208
isn't wrong from archaic practices upheld with no thought into doing research to ensure that,0.013009662
the mascara could actually fend off an attack from the outside world and yes I,0.2546209
know that's getting into the weeds but even her mom isn't honest with her about,0.11527832
what her very purpose in life is and when she's helping the army out they,0.045054883
don't want to listen to her and also they superduper want a controller she puts,0.056146156
up with precisely none of these gender politics causing issues that Diana doesn't even care,0.08800646
to understand and Steve somehow manages to calm down her understandable displeasure with the world,0.09909773
by lassoing literally himself and that's a repeated theme throughout the movie is that her,0.0519402
friends are the ones who don't really try to control her that that much that,0.029379832
it's that they also do a little bit though it doesn't work that either and,0.03208447
if I may it has proven instantly the Diana as a person has a measurable,0.09930128
increase on the quality of life for literally the entire world and that's just by,0.07264138
existing in it your move Superman diana is lied to like a lot opiate because,0.065735444
she has a higher given purpose but it is not a purpose anyone is honest,0.04184138
with her about so we get our first taste of the world war one back,0.10313739
story through flashback within flashback and that goes on like three or four times I,0.022589637
don't know I lost count which is all revealed to us in one of my,0.06792789
favorite scenes where Steve gets lasso of truth did again and asked to reveal literally,0.020902066
everything including what war the war the war dead end all wars which is the,0.16905975
break into Act two we are now getting a war film at the same time,0.062174715
as the superhero film as the superhero origin film you know after Diana steals all,0.029343246
the fun wonder weapons which were hers to begin with and even in banishment Diana's,0.08025574
mom does not tell her the truth still should have told her the more she,0.04429458
knows no sooner he'll find her cool that'll ensure everybody's did destruction though um anyway,0.089614205
Diana and Steve are now best friends because when you think about it Diana's never,0.018629799
really had a friend before and they're the two people most out of their elements,0.07778059
in this entire situation their bond makes in a sixth-grade kind of weird way but,0.055188958
warranted and earned and also they're in love sometimes but I mean and this is,0.022278996
where gal gadot - yes you say the T begins to absolutely shine like when,0.04844466
confronted with German baddies and Steve Trevor is like good fahadh me but then she,0.11010918
blocks a bullet and he's like or maybe not but the key to this scene,0.4593305
is in how the conflict is resolved without any further confrontation after making short work,0.018778134
of everyone that's armed and providing an imminent threat when the fight is over Diana,0.07210059
first apologizes to the man she just hurt and speaks compassion whereas Batman would have,0.04026024
that that basically this movie is a lot of people trying to tell Diana who,0.033789333
she is and what she can do and her not really taking too kindly to,0.042728737
their suggestions also defying Authority for altruistic reasons you know a super hero a little,0.023130432
bit power fantasy a little bit punk rock a little bit uplifting warm look at,0.2670042
why you do the right thing because we're all on the same team you would,0.02356147
knowingly sacrifice all those lives as if they mean less than yours this may mean,0.48188412
nothing it's a lot of things a billion in fact one way to describe it,0.02660801
would be to say that this film deals with PTSD more than the majority of,0.024801372
war films which is a telling statement and this film doesn't deal with it a,0.053075667
great deal but it does acknowledge it if even through the lens of a World,0.025842385
War 1 mindset and the PTSD side story ends with me ya know Charlie won't,0.23323613
sing for us this is why this movie is awesome details Diana paid attention to,0.03685716
in a world entirely confusing and new to her that no one else noticed because,0.03301506
Diana is kind compassionate and modeled not from clay but from human empathy wonder woman,0.077097446
sets an example not just to young girls and women though it was certainly judged,0.09407293
unfairly under that exact metrics she sets an example for all of the other superheroes,0.05065041
no I'm sure Batman is a good role model for young boys he just painfully,0.086846374
disfigures people to get them murdered in prison how is that Batman and that trait,0.47185454
is not solely Batman's which is when Diana accomplishes her mission and the movie gets,0.009334522
a little dark she's blindly still trusting the words of her people when so many,0.09033061
of them lied to her I mean she outright murders the man she thinks is,0.20371914
Ares and has no concept of why there is still war in the world she,0.1497508
was sold a simplified vision of it and we get the chewy nougat II centre,0.035171587
of this film my favorite Chris Pine performance ever yes even better than smoking aces,0.07166356
because it is just so honest maybe maybe we don't but it's not about that,0.020671247
it's about what you believe you don't think I get it after what I've seen,0.048956852
out there you don't think I wish I could tell you that it was one,0.060699336
bad guy to blame it's not believed in doing good things just to do them,0.07053208
Steve dies for this idea and this sacrifice connects Diana to exactly what he was,0.16093187
trying to say humans are bad a lot of them in fact so when I,0.12113659
say Wonder Woman is a movie about a billion things I mean it those billion,0.04919166
things all work and they work together and it leans in every direction it has,0.022920897
to to make it work it gets campy it gets silly it gets heavy it,0.1658376
does what it needs to because it's a billion great things here's why I think,0.028723296
what patty Jenkins and company managed to accomplish here is monumental it took an icon,0.045933593
with a rich and wildly diverse back catalogue of quality and made a modern thing,0.08056904
with a modern message and it was one of peace and hope and acceptance and,0.02600868
yes love the kind of love you have for Humanity when you are sworn to,0.066320136
protect it and as you learn usually from itself because some people are bad but,0.09370509
even the unseen demonic God force admits he wasn't responsible for any of this some,0.26542732
people are just bad which is an ultimately myopic naive point that I wish all,0.3409411
superhero movies would make people are ultimately good and in the face of a lot,0.105711654
of current evidence to the contrary the majority of people are ultimately good something diana,0.044091698
takes on faith because one person she knew her best friend in fact was a,0.033366278
really good person I like it when my superhero movies actually attempt the good role,0.031064076
model thing and I don't mean that all superhero films have to be role models,0.021851948
just sharing my personal belief that given their young schooling audience it doesn't suck when,0.28678724
someone stands up for the good in humanity for giving our weaknesses and tries to,0.054091405
show us a better world and I know it's artfully rewarding to deconstruct the ideas,0.099093735
of superheroes at what seems like our apex of them but we also live in,0.040379975
a day and age where things are so polarized you actually don't necessarily want your,0.03785427
flagrant fictional escapism to remind you of the dour hopeless visit we struggle to hang,0.29821423
up over the crumbling old one frankly it isn't the time for Watchmen and wouldn't,0.03002639
you know it we trusted someone to make a deconstructive superhero film and I don't,0.021482106
want to be this negative but he hasn't shown a general aptitude for con strutting,0.07175203
them let alone deconstructing them you want to talk about hitting from the rough Patti,0.10325446
followed Batman V Superman dawn of Justice that's like making a Padme spin-off after episode,0.046967953
two they should be carrying petty jiggets off the field like Rudy after this so,0.08158877
here's a wild idea give Justice League to two patty Jenkins even if it's a,0.076997004
soft reboot to point yourselves in the right direction again like making Wonder Woman the,0.071712784
leader of the entire team this time because she's the only one that actually acts,0.0573069
like a you know human like what if WB's DC movies were the ones that,0.18829952
actually had something to say about superhero films here's a bad thought when Captain Marvel,0.053389635
comes out it will be the twenty first film that Marvel Studios has released it,0.05659981
took them twenty-one movies to get to the point where they actually felt comfortable having,0.03661703
a woman anchor a solo film that's a lot 21 DC it took you for,0.050430235
three if you don't count Suicide Squad and I will grant you that Mulligan you,0.3960412
have an own an amazing blueprint a blueprint that a particular Wonder Woman fought against,0.0482757
you to make something that will ultimately define the genre in the moment we are,0.01584401
currently in your move yeah so this is the last episode of the year I,0.028937483
know last year I did a big end of 2016 spectacular or not really gonna,0.029824173
be happen in this year also quick thank you to Lily Tommy serenity and Logan,0.026555462
for helping me out on this episode we're gonna go into the patrons but I'm,0.043620083
gonna keep talking for a second this year got scary and was sad and was,0.035129014
really hard and I didn't enjoy it a lot but I hope you enjoyed some,0.08125751
of the more wild swings and tone I took on this show trying to find,0.030467406
you know something by the way I'm playing crowd noise because it's thought it would,0.025342166
be a fun thing to do where I'm just like yo what's up William Dixon,0.020326016
