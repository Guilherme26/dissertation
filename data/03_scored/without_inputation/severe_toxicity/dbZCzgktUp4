spotlight is the most important movie about investigative journalism since all the president's men but,0.023879427
for some reason it's not making the same impression with the general public which I,0.046328712
found incredibly frustrating when I was leaving the theater because I thought the movie was,0.02865079
so good I was like man why are more people talking about this why is,0.050863933
almost everyone in this theater a senior citizen why is spotlight getting swept under the,0.039237186
rug so I saw this movie on Saturday night and I thought about it and,0.059832603
I thought about it and I not only came up with two reasons why this,0.03689574
movie isn't getting more coverage and is it making more of an impression but also,0.0134373745
in the course of finding out those two reasons and discovering them I also came,0.038650494
to the realization that the movie is deeply flawed but you should still see it,0.032144334
and I'm gonna tell you why but first why spotlight is not connecting the first,0.019330902
is that and these are my own investigative notes that I have right here the,0.009005921
first is that there are some things that the public no matter how horrific and,0.04669988
unjust they're just not willing to acknowledge and it seems that the dark side of,0.05917673
the Catholic Church is one of those things I mean just look at the aftermath,0.059496686
of this story actually breaking because this is a true story the Catholic Church still,0.050416265
around and nobody really seems to want to confront this look at all the people,0.098197736
who showed up to see the Pope even though they know yeah well I don't,0.03163946
want to give away the details of the story because I think they're very important,0.04084028
to discover along with the film but I think you'll be surprised when the film,0.019890321
is done that the Catholic Church seems so unscathed and despite of everything that's happened,0.09988397
and I think that you know in contrast I'm going to contrast law with all,0.03030244
the president's men because they're similar films nobody has an emotional attachment to the government,0.06794518
so people were happy to have that change how they felt about the government so,0.022072123
you saw a much bigger actual reaction from the public when they learned about that,0.025072102
scandal than the church scandal so the the public basically the number one thing is,0.03782833
the public has already said we're not interested in the church Catholic Church scandal we're,0.045958202
not going to acknowledge it so perhaps open road is aware of this so that's,0.04217996
why they've created it the number two reason this movie isn't connecting and that's because,0.023167681
open road and I think that's a some degree the film itself an open road,0.040939394
is the distributor I've decided that this is a movie about investigative journalism only and,0.018500753
that's all they're focusing on I saw some awards coverage actually variety reach retweeted it,0.051005617
out or sent to that as an email to people on their email lists and,0.035324577
I'm one of them being like did you miss this spotlight discussion because nobody's talking,0.06382038
about spotlight and they were like oh it's talking about investigative journalism that's what this,0.027137497
movie is about and I'm like no I don't think this movie is totally about,0.033667605
investigative journalism and you know that's that's the wrong play here I mean think about,0.033710178
just even the title of the movie it's spotlight whereas the title of all the,0.014792354
president's men referenced the scandal but this movie's title references to people who uncovered the,0.07374958
scandal and while intellectually that might be the right hook because of number one with,0.04569346
people saying you know what I don't want to acknowledge the Catholic Church scandal emotionally,0.14221892
it's not the right play and it's not enough I think oh poor investigative journalism,0.042904343
that's not enough to get people to really pay attention to this movie now of,0.023238856
course investigative journalism is important is important and this movie is about investigative journalism and,0.025648816
actually when I was watching the film I was like wow these people should be,0.02472155
paid more this is just horribly you know this is unjust as well and I,0.09812722
would actually liken it to Trumbo a movie also playing right now the people also,0.042647585
aren't paying any attention to that talks about the importance of screenwriting and I think,0.018770818
that both of these movies highlight how we're becoming a culture devoid of substance or,0.03446117
at least where substance is not valued and that that's pretty alarming all by itself,0.051433995
but investigative journalism particularly in this context and in the context of all the president's,0.030175392
men but even more so here because wait wait for it wait for it because,0.06389421
I've done the work that this movie only a little bit did investigative journalism is,0.04194382
just the tool and the real story here is the scandal and the people who,0.021108273
uncovered that scandal now what the with the scandal Mark Ruffalo's character I mean they,0.024078317
the movie touches on these things but it doesn't do a good enough job of,0.048976142
driving at home it's like it's like investigative journalism that just puts all the facts,0.020941311
up there but doesn't frame it for you doesn't give it a voice doesn't give,0.023707146
a perspective and that's what I think this movie is missing to some degree I,0.025654137
would liken it a little bit to the wolf of Wall Street for Martin Scorsese,0.032684464
which also failed to have a creative voice to have perspective to have you have,0.03937754
the film to have itself and offer some kind of judgment not judgment as in,0.04376975
what's right or wrong but you know again you know a few point but anyway,0.029001342
Mark Ruffalo's character says something very interesting during the movie and he says when he,0.020291427
fit when he learns the actual details of what happened with the church over decades,0.022985421
something in his belief of the church cracks it just cracks and I thought kind,0.11319297
of had a similar experience as well watching the movie and I think that they,0.02682087
as I said with Watergate people didn't have an emotional connection to the government so,0.035490207
they were willing to be like yeah the government is evil oh thanks for telling,0.08490537
me uh you know Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward I appreciate it but here this,0.05548829
is the church this is a big part of people's lives it's their Savior it's,0.06426472
God so people are like I don't want to know why'd you tell me so,0.08389629
I think that's kind of the reaction that's there you know the incredible faith and,0.016539127
how much this meat and what the church means to people and what you're asking,0.08793462
them to give up by acknowledging that these things that we're done and the movie,0.02114885
has the opportunity to go there with Rachel McAdams grandmother a character that is so,0.016453983
underutilized that you're like well why was she in this movie if not to make,0.06285919
this point so they could have done it they could have stressed that and I,0.023881422
don't think they do for instance I believe that rachel mcadams grandmother continues to go,0.03873697
to church after after this movie and I think that that should have been made,0.04777482
more clear then is for the people who discovered the scandal the movie touches on,0.057923526
the importance that the globe the Boston Globe the paper in question suddenly found itself,0.039752707
with outsiders in key positions which allow this story to finally come to light Liev,0.052417137
Schreiber's editor editor in chief he's playing a terran chief a Jewish individual and a,0.026033958
you know who better to be willing to call out the Catholic Church right Mark,0.08968206
Ruffalo's investigative reporter who very much is an outsider you know very bad social skills,0.06932212
etc and also Stanley Tucci's lawyer who you know from you'll see in the film,0.0146167455
underlines what he feels that he's an outsider okay and that's what it took to,0.042092822
break a story that was covered up by one of the most insider II towns,0.028951453
cities in the world Boston and actually they have an insider in the spotlight team,0.03696226
played by Michael Keaton's character and there's a startling discovery that he makes towards the,0.019638881
end of the film about his own coverage of this story which I think wasn't,0.018509401
spotlighted enough they should have done a better job juxtaposing insiders versus outsiders and i,0.08095684
think that it's wonderful to see a movie highlight the importance of outsiders and that,0.032919273
they do a lot of work you know it's the checks the system of checks,0.02590225
and balances and without the outsiders you know the insiders can get away with anything,0.026939938
and I think that just to show you how strong a combination faith and insider,0.033044994
status can be that's the exact same thing that happened at Penn State with their,0.02035196
molestation scandal with Jerry Sandusky who was molesting students for 15 years at the school,0.40479404
because people had too much financially invested in the football institution of the program they,0.010517884
had a lot emotionally attached to the school they loved the culture of being part,0.04413826
of the school on the sports system the alumni and also people believed in that,0.011906787
it was like the heart of the school the sports program the football team and,0.013115426
they didn't want to blacken it with something that was unfortunately deaf but you know,0.22768289
they were willing to let people suffer like this just like what happened with the,0.09745406
church so that just shows you you know how potent and how ugly the combination,0.22643617
of faith and insider status is now with the film itself the craftsmanship of the,0.017249543
film I think as a result of all these things that are missed the directing,0.037510373
in the script are weak and Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams just go through the,0.056135513
motions I think their performances are poor yeah not like embarrassing but I think it's,0.074279726
embarrassing that they didn't do the work they needed to do all of these people,0.07000259
the director of the writer Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams but that doesn't mean this,0.011940046
movie is devoid of great performances because the outsiders really do a fantastic job I,0.050041765
I've never seen Liev Schreiber so understated it was really cool to watch I've never,0.057791155
seen would quite look like this I thought that the makeover they gave him really,0.028549017
did a lot and he did such a wonderful job with his character Stanley Tucci,0.021867247
always of the light but I really liked his performance here there was a seriousness,0.038338523
to it that we haven't seen with him in a long time he's usually become,0.05141138
a bit of a clown kind of like an arthouse Johnny Depp but he was,0.32241333
very very good here but I thought that the real standout was actually Mark Ruffalo,0.022539748
who and all of these gentlemen are doing fantastic character acting but mark ruffalo made,0.06832301
such strong character actor choices and I've never seen him portray a character like this,0.018262617
before but yet it was someone I instantly real recognized from you know real life,0.047880583
that it was so great to see him bring that character to life on there,0.028871631
on the big screen I also want to give a shout out to the actors,0.07222564
who played the victims who I think did a fantastic job of portraying people who,0.08066483
you can see why they were targeted because of the horrible situations they found themselves,0.06274744
in but yet they were a very diverse group but also every one of them,0.022121347
seemed like such wonderful people they pointed out that none of them deserve to have,0.18095124
this happen to them and that they were people too people had have been cast,0.112549074
aside by the insiders who had too much to lose so finally in conclusion spotlight,0.039411467
is not a masterfully crafted film it's not even a well-crafted film because of all,0.050099637
the things that it fails to do you know to really dive into here but,0.023139743
it's a good enough film and the story that it depicts is so amazing and,0.016421389
so thrilling and all these elements can be taken from the movie if you know,0.067107715
you let it sink in then I think it is a hundred and ten percent,0.12921923
worth seeing and as a filmed you know anyone who's interested in filmmaking I think,0.055193614
it's also fascinating to see what the movie misses and how it doesn't go for,0.021551285
it far enough and I've actually been hearing a similar thing about concussion the concussion,0.053041745
has a great story all the tools it needs but it doesn't go far enough,0.039549157
and so I'm nervous but I hope that is not the case there as well,0.031845003
so that's my review of spotlight thank you everybody thank you for those of you,0.058599353
who insisted I go see this because it's not getting a lot of coverage people,0.06170044
aren't that interested in it but I do think it's worth your time I look,0.0466786
forward to continuing the conversation down below and you can check out some other episodes,0.028601566
