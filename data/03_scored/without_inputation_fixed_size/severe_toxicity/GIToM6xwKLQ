classic movie review today we're going to be reviewing it happened one night from 1934,0.050794754
one of the great romantic comedies of all time well that's what a lot of,0.036837872
people say anyway and it is directed by Frank Capra it stars a Clark Gable,0.024109581
and Claudette Colbert I believe that's how you pronounce her name and it's about a,0.036579113
spoilt highness who runs away from her father after what she feels his mistreatment and,0.087849475
on her bus journey to New York she meets clock gabled character who is a,0.03766935
newspaper man who his job is a you know it's on the line at the,0.039472662
moment he looks like he's going to lose his job and he really needs a,0.04167841
story that's worthy of him keeping his job and and this woman is incredibly famous,0.14810912
and if he can get her story to his newspaper he might be able to,0.016811186
get to keep his job and during this period their romance and saw characters sort,0.021537317
of develop along the way and several situations and shenanigans in the shoe so what,0.052056607
did I think of it happened one night well that's what I'm here to talk,0.026095154
to you about today the main things that I really enjoyed in the film the,0.01876084
first thing has to be Clark Gable because I believe that this is I haven't,0.015622503
really seen Kyle gurgling much I haven't even seen gone with the wind not because,0.018645098
I don't want to see gone with the wind is because I literally don't have,0.015907867
time in my life to sit down watch a movie for four hours um it's,0.07331255
it's too long but it literally is too long though I don't have time but,0.031437244
wait if I ever get the time I might might watch gone with the wind,0.024424879
but that might not ever happen and this is the first one were ever seen,0.034193765
Clark they blew so and I think he was fantastic in this movie I think,0.08460205
he was really charming what are you entertaining very funny quick he had quite ego,0.09552237
in this film and he was just really sharp and I really enjoyed him in,0.09039313
this film there's a lot of great scenes with him and called at Cole but,0.03888065
that just they bounce off each other really well and she's very good in the,0.14683862
film as well but I think cloud gave already steals the show here I think,0.08857253
he's very very good very very charming very very entertaining but one of the main,0.06842611
reasons that these two actors work so well together is because of the script I,0.0636787
think this is a very very sharp script for the time is very very fresh,0.03944007
and it's very very funny it's not you know it's not an out and out,0.053637747
comedy this isn't a laugh riot or anything this isn't like a Marx Brothers movie,0.028829724
this is this is a more of a light comedy but it's still very entertaining,0.030617738
and you definitely get a few chuckles out of the script and I think it's,0.06056098
maximized by the performances by Goldberg and gable I think that they really bring this,0.02251048
script up on upper level but I think it's a very good script my things,0.04766839
very well written Capra does a great job directing this movie it's got his sort,0.07394514
of nice sort of sweet sentimentality to it you can definitely see Kat Pratt in,0.019937549
Spielberg if use the way they direct their kind of have every man film sort,0.056297153
of sweet sentimental messages and overall I really enjoy his direction in this film is,0.02710956
still not my favorite Capra film that would be it's wonderful life which I should,0.09567802
maybe be reviewing this Christmas as a special video so look out for that but,0.050195422
yeah I think capper is a very good director I want to watch more of,0.036372907
his films and this was I think one you know I've watched two of his,0.07638902
films now on both of them in a very good yeah I thought there was,0.04831029
specific scenes especially that I really liked in this film that was a scene where,0.02141093
Clark Gable talks to Cole boots character about how he undresses which is a very,0.094530575
funny scene there's a very famous scene about hitchhiking how to hitchcock hitchhike which is,0.10871096
very very entertaining and there are many other scenes that are very good like comedy,0.028825069
very entertaining very sweet and innocent and this film is very innocent I mean anyone,0.085062355
could watch this this it's not going to offend anyone this is a really nice,0.09213791
film anyone have any age young and old could watch this film they enjoy it,0.08822597
and I think that comes sort of onto my negatives with the film it isn't,0.021193417
really specifically a negative is that it's a little dated this film and you'd expect,0.0618521
a film from 1934 to be a little bit dated that's not really my main,0.051710047
negative it really is is that it's very predictable I mean you can I'm just,0.04083363
going to say it they are they end up getting married at the end Clark,0.040565558
Gable and Cole but they were lost you fall in love and they get married,0.11378964
and you know that's you know standard its standard what happens in romance films they,0.018734232
you know we will get a happy ending and it's fine but I'm one of,0.17667744
these cynical people but kind of likes that sort of thing to be turned on,0.19718105
its head every soft and I feel like the best romantic films do that the,0.067116365
Casablanca cause of this world the Vertigo's even though the vertigo isn't straight up a,0.060155217
romance it's as much your psychological thriller as it is a romance but I feel,0.09052551
like the best romantic films try to do something different with the ending because it's,0.053309146
so easy to just do a happily ever after and that's pretty much what this,0.029699119
film does but you know it is it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the,0.016575046
rest of the film it would have just been nice to see something different so,0.032931913
overall I really enjoyed it happened one might thought it was really sweet and funny,0.06272083
I thought the script was fantastic and I thought the performances by product cobalt and,0.019047534
especially Clark Gable in this film we're very very good there's only a few negatives,0.031179152
being that it's quite predictable ending and there is a little bit dated but that's,0.05303975
what you would expect from a form of this age when overall I really enjoyed,0.061675828
it's wonderful it's a wonderful life no it happened one night I really enjoyed it,0.07858014
and I'm going to give it 8 point 5 out of 10 and yeah it,0.09265875
would have been a bit higher if maybe the ending had been slightly less conventional,0.1940487
but I still really enjoyed it and I definitely you know tell you guys if,0.020075243
you haven't seen it to check it out it probably won't be a blu-ray purchase,0.036839865
