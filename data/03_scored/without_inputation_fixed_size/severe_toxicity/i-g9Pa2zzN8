what's up guys it's well back again and today's view is the fantasy drama film,0.07938102
the shape of water co-written and directed by Guillermo del Toro the shape of water,0.036017034
takes place in the 1960s and primarily follows Sally Hawkins character Eliza Esposito Eliza works,0.033120826
as a janitor at a Research Center in Baltimore and begins interacting with the strange,0.013741364
creature that's being studied by medical professionals at the research center as time passes Eliza,0.050251964
finds herself at odds with the scientists and government officials as she begins getting attached,0.03149711
to the creature and the rest of the film spent watching their friendship evolve as,0.020800957
the government attempts to simply understand what this animal was alright so I can't exactly,0.08144376
say I was looking forward to the shape of water I mean I definitely wanted,0.034171816
to see it because it's guillermo del toro but it wasn't something that I was,0.036263153
like dying to see you know like when the trailers came out I was interested,0.11598408
in it I wasn't blown away by what I saw in those trailers I didn't,0.025160572
feel like I had to rush out and see it but like I said since,0.023164356
Guillermo del Toro's name was attached to it I felt like I kind of had,0.025356136
to see it and I saw the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes like I said don't,0.058169644
I don't ever read reviews beforehand but I do look at scores a lot of,0.016910298
times because you know I don't get any early access to these movies I see,0.03366162
him most the time the same time do you guys do really I was so,0.0300816
really disappointed with this one I was very disappointed with the shape of water because,0.035335887
it feels if I feel like I had no emotion to it I felt no,0.04210812
connection to the characters and it wasn't really entertained it was just kind of a,0.011064664
very boring movie and that's probably gonna be upsetting to a lot of different people,0.07821229
out there who probably loved this film but it was very boring I found myself,0.0468276
checking my my watch on my phone a lot just because I just felt like,0.036459383
there was nothing really happening it felt like I wasn't engaged in the story like,0.020995192
things were progressing but it eventually just kind of felt like a collection of scenes,0.036203284
kind of you know mashed all together into this force kind of awkward romance story,0.076390356
and that's you know it is unique it's a very unique movie and I think,0.032077152
that will resonate with some people this love story it's a very unique very different,0.031781144
type of love story very different type of romance story than what you've probably ever,0.017230917
seen before or at least very different from what you've seen before and that's cool,0.024455477
that Guillermo del Toro took that direction but you still kind of gotta have you,0.08569361
know good character and the story that's actually entertaining and you know makes sense to,0.011129187
me this story doesn't make sense there's a lot of things that happen to feel,0.03433279
very forced like I said it feels like the romance is the biggest part of,0.04195646
the story and they make sure that happens no matter which direction the characters are,0.00925337
going and no matter which direction things are headed and when it comes to the,0.023472335
entertainment factor that's a really really big issue for a movie like this I mean,0.0429549
any movie really I mean there's a lot of things that movies can try to,0.026693154
do they can try to help you learn something help you feel something but entertainment,0.02618828
is the primary focus for a lot of films and this film is not an,0.025818437
exclusion from that and it's not a very entertaining movie like I said I was,0.050248638
very very bored this is by a lot of people considered one of the best,0.018949086
movies of 2017 and for me it's one of the worst because it was so,0.06743898
boring there was like I said there was no engagement no attachment for me it,0.07131434
felt like a very hollow experience very hollow and like I didn't care about anything,0.06309799
I didn't care about the characters I didn't care about anything that was happening that,0.017955968
was going on in this story and that's a big problem because if you're feeling,0.0239812
that way and you're feeling that cold towards the story and towards the characters that's,0.009738954
that speaks volumes for how much you're enjoying the movie because if you're not you're,0.034614827
not engaged in that way you know you're not doing much and it's not like,0.04502894
I'm a huge Guillermo del Toro fan of his that I've seen is actually Pan's,0.028642142
Labyrinth I don't think I've seen any other his films I mean I have to,0.06284389
go down his IMDB page and check but I was more interested in his work,0.13191123
because he has that kind of credibility as a director a lot of people consider,0.03202194
him to be one of the best a lot of people love his work and,0.031524383
love his films and I think expectations were very high for this movie and that,0.057157233
maybe that could be why people are judging it so favorably I don't know maybe,0.023929317
they actually enjoyed it this wasn't a movie that when I went out to see,0.03125698
you today that I was going out there and really hyped really excited to see,0.05970888
it sound like I was going to see Star Wars or Avengers or even a,0.018752193
trail that really wowed me like moonlight or lala land last year arrival those movies,0.060117967
were movies I was really excited to see going into the shape of water not,0.053667016
so much I mean like I was going into it expecting it to be good,0.060147237
I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as I thought it was but I,0.04061079
didn't expect it to be great either because I feel like the trailer their story,0.011877519
just didn't act with me I didn't feel any sort of emotion from the trailer,0.02446612
I didn't I felt cold like I did throughout the entire movie and besides a,0.015889242
few scenes I think a lot of the reason or the biggest reason that I,0.049492326
felt so cold was because there's no build up to it there's no build up,0.026786946
tinea scenes things just happen things just happen like so the collection of scenes that,0.03614874
lead to events that are in the script and they have to be there that's,0.018569931
how this feels to me it feels very contrived and that's a big problem for,0.025181193
a movie that's you know supposed to entertain me and supposed to make me my,0.10508904
heart warm basically I'm supposed to have a heart warming to an extent experience from,0.021660374
this because it is a romance story it's a romance story it was sold as,0.019164607
romance story it is it's a very odd one but it is that and that,0.014496347
may be part of the problem too I mean it's a romance story like I,0.021309823
said and the romance is between a sea fish monster and a woman and it,0.19949058
just feels weird it just feels weird and like I can't really connect to the,0.01785752
story no matter how much outcasts they are how abused they've been how neglected they've,0.07400235
been in society or you know wherever this wherever they've been that didn't really change,0.04693935
the fact that I couldn't get invested in their relationship I couldn't get invested in,0.024184747
their evolving relationship and that was something that you know is gonna if you can't,0.015657093
either if you feel like this movie is gonna be too weird for you and,0.04802626
you're not gonna be able to get invested in this unusual romance to say the,0.0319368
least and you're not gonna enjoy this movie I'm guessing a big reason people really,0.0712578
enjoy this film or some of the critics really enjoy of this film is because,0.03847156
of the characters the characters are outcasts almost all of them and they all interact,0.02035196
and identify with each other in unique and outcasts like ways they've all kind of,0.0662024
been shunned by society in some way they all kind of feel unaccepted or unappreciated,0.07896461
in some way and that's something that does resonate throughout this story and that kind,0.022845067
of identifies and goes with the creature that Sally Hawkins character you know has a,0.03241706
romantic connection with because they're similar in that way but it's just it's just weird,0.13684957
I think if you're really into artsy really unique films which I am to an,0.07240258
extent then you probably will enjoy this I think this is very specific to a,0.035180897
very specific crowd very film buff very hardcore movie lovers artsy film lovers those kind,0.09205942
of those kind of crowds that's this movie is going to appeal so and otherwise,0.03238247
if you're not in that crowd I think you won't like it but there are,0.047694996
a few things I liked about this film I mean the shape water does have,0.041324534
some redeeming qualities I mean I think sally hawkins is really great in her role,0.071787946
as Eliza I think she's probably the best thing going for this film I liked,0.056512006
her character the most but I was more impressed by the performance I mean this,0.03732811
is a very difficult role to pull off considering Eliza is a mute she has,0.061021954
to speak through sign language she has to relate a lot of emotion to her,0.02166104
facial expressions and body language and just general tone without actually speaking anything that's a,0.04741828
very tough role to take on very difficult role to take on not a lot,0.03623987
of actresses could do that role and I thought she pulled it off really really,0.030541241
well Michael Shannon is also really great he's great in a different kind of way,0.03812367
he's intense very creepy it's a very Michael Shannon s kind of role I plays,0.09157849
a government official and he's very serious about this asset this creature I thought he,0.059792027
was really great to him and Sally Hawkins were great activity Octavia Spencer was also,0.04055425
really good she was good as well so the acting is good it's just weird,0.1476262
to me that I liked all the performances but I hated all the characters even,0.0959115
the good guys and the bad guys I hate I didn't like either didn't connect,0.03546493
with either of them that's kind of weird that so that's a rarity for me,0.14747787
and I think I can you know most people can separate the difference between a,0.0127056725
good performance and a good character or bad performance and a bad character here good,0.03300508
performances bad characters that's kind of how I do it the movie also looks cool,0.05250095
I mean the CGI looks cool there's a lot of really slow-mo shots a lot,0.307238
of pans and zooms a lot of great cinematography work a lot of interesting lighting,0.105603226
lighting efforts letting work in this film it's a very pleasant very easy film to,0.048536453
look at it has that 1960s vibe and feel and tone to it visually visually,0.019461278
this film looks great a lot of underwater shots that look we're really really cool,0.15095346
very artistic looking it's a very easy film to look at just not a very,0.030685587
easy film to engage with emotionally alright there's one more bad thing I have to,0.07979809
say about the shape of water so the ending the ending is very out there,0.026912665
like the rest of the film but it makes no sense I was very confused,0.015366407
and very frustrated but not surprised because the rest of the movie kind of does,0.0295142
the same thing and it very much left me underwhelm very cold I walked to,0.03507048
that theatre very disappointed that was you know the whole movie kind of felt that,0.046220284
way to me but the ending was just you know the icing on the cake,0.047154203
as for the pros cons though the shape of water had very nice acting performances,0.07673758
from Sally Hawkins Octavia Spencer and Michael Shannon they were all really good and it,0.019663494
looks cool the visual experience is very nice CGI looks cool the cinematography the lighting,0.04965463
all looks very good as for the cons the story was very uninteresting it lacked,0.031554315
emotional resonance and didn't have much of an entertainment factor the pacing was a little,0.015748888
bit of a mess there were a lot of collections of scenes no build-up not,0.07155447
not much tension to experience in this film the ending was very anticlimactic and the,0.06197383
characters as a whole were also very very underwhelming I'm gonna give the shape of,0.05287146
water a 4.5 out of 10 I know that's very disappointing to hear for a,0.033470046
lot of you and I'm gonna recommend that you pass on this one in theaters,0.06375253
you might want to see it if you love Guillermo del Toro and you're just,0.045054883
looking for a very out-there romance story but otherwise for most audience members the vast,0.023276106
majority of you I feel like you could really pass on this one so did,0.029977832
you guys see the shape of water yet what did you think of it and,0.022867683
if not let me know why not and also let me know your favorite gear,0.036837205
mando Toro film I guess mine would be Pan's Labyrinth I don't really have much,0.051680114
of a choice that's all for now though this is wolf Aqsa fication signing off,0.033185348
