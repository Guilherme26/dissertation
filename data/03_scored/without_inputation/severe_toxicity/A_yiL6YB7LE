dealing with the problems that come with that but also being the Black Panther and,0.03369554
problems that come with that I don't envy his position I really don't and when,0.04878324

imagination do you have to have to pull that kind of performance when you're looking,0.018095655
at a sea of green when you look at what these movies are doing as,0.032389786
they're shifting into deeper character pieces quiet breath sometimes you can tell the green screen,0.038054492
which is a bummer a couple scenes where they're talking I'm like that that's a,0.09610241
green screen you couldn't find a mountain you couldn't just talk on a mountain I,0.037167802
don't know I don't make movies maybe they couldn't maybe it's just too cumbersome to,0.11985013
bring it crew up there but I liked the arc they gave King T'Challa because,0.034864936
when we saw him in Captain America Civil War he ultimately was a dude on,0.0654421
a revenge quest and I totally get to class me that hard all the time,0.1781661
I want to see the guy's heart how is he as a king is he,0.077659525

man and a good king and you totally feel that as Captain America was the,0.052008048
introduction to him this is the movie that gives that arc more relevant this is,0.029399786
one of those movies that strips away the armor we see the King behind the,0.03298513
black panther the man behind the armor I love stories like that unpopular opinion coming,0.30790687
at you I really enjoyed Iron Man 3 and I really loved the first Thor,0.043646026
because both of those movies strip away the hero and we deal with the person,0.0972412
behind the hero this movie does a lot of that too yeah he does suit,0.035319258
up in the black panther suit and when he does is pretty entertaining actually there's,0.012668422
one car chase sequence it's more than pretty entertaining it's pretty kick-ass well really when,0.5236733
I think about this movie I'm not gonna think about the Black Panther scenes first,0.11744416
and foremost I'm going to think about the character moments I'm gonna think about the,0.013799234
politics I'm gonna think about the culture I was so fascinated as to how into,0.049431793
wakandan culture I was it was so fantastic you feel like you have a front-row,0.16249107
seat to all of it you're interested and also how much of it stuck with,0.016030261
me I mean you really look at other worlds and movies and comic book movies,0.09515119
they don't do the same thing this movie as I can seem recent memory did,0.03130088
it best you see what a movie introduces the audience to a new civilization or,0.0370627
culture when the audience leaves that movie they can ask themselves what do I know,0.028660769
about that civilization or culture and usually the answer is very little it's not so,0.040699262
the case with Wakanda with Wakanda you walk out a black panther you feel like,0.33897427
you got a crash course in Wakanda and when you see it it comes across,0.107348666
as a very beautiful and celebratory thing I think that's fantastic and reviewing an MCU,0.05423442
movie you got to address the Marvel isms which are how does it tie into,0.047181476
the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole does the tie-in take point over the standalone,0.052515585
aspect of the movie and how is the humor not is the humor in it,0.028626177
but it's going to be in it so how is it for a large chunk,0.0637798
of this movie it works as a standalone film there are tie-ins in it the,0.035217483
fact that clause in it vibranium is a big part of it also Martin Freeman's,0.023807587
character but if you just went into Black Panther you would get the gist you,0.09723256
wouldn't need to watch another movie maybe Civil War it being the first movie with,0.028584937
Black Panther but really nothing else and I felt the humor really worked what I,0.12902899
look for with humor in a movie like this or a Marvel movie is it's,0.060225062
going to have humor so does the humor override the drama like if someone's having,0.039497938
a dramatic moment if there is a moment that's supposed to marinate and have drama,0.030422173
if you're supposed to take a pause is there a joke that compromises the whole,0.045895677
thing when that happens in movies it irritates me this movie doesn't do that the,0.029639253
supporting cast and characters that were fantastic - I love those warrior ladies I loved,0.032181583
his tech head sister Lupita Nyong'o was fantastic I loved him back ooh he's the,0.2413634
character man ape but they never call him man Abby's calling Tanaka I believe it,0.23876522
is pronounced mbaku I'm horrible with names names like Smith I'm like was it Smith,0.05816299
or Smyth but he was great I wanted to see more of him he was,0.038745616
so good and I had heard fantastic things about Michael B Jordan as the character,0.0296632
kill monger as the villain and he is great when he shows up when he's,0.6357945
on screen his motivation is clear you understand to a degree where he's coming from,0.036707494
but of course he's a villain so he's going about it the wrong way those,0.08000496
make for the best villains of my book but again I say when he shows,0.059763424
up because for the first half of this movie he doesn't I found that to,0.035083782
be a problem he does one thing near the beginning of the movie then after,0.041141607
that I forgot he was in it and he finally shows up and starts doing,0.03402614
his thing and it kind of gave this movie the feeling of being black panther,0.24241813
and black panther - crushed into one movie which I don't know if that was,0.22533354
the case I don't know if they were like that we have two ideas for,0.04520322
Black Panther we'll make him one I don't know if they were like we have,0.3631205
an idea for Black Panther but hey we got it incorporate Klaw into the movie,0.10756951
or if they were like we're going for the Godfather feeling where it's like three,0.030379603
movies in one well Godfather was three movies in Willing this feels like - I,0.035348523
don't know all I know is it makes Black Panther feel like it was split,0.18255433
down the middle into two movies and it feels like a season of 24 if,0.03185498
you remember the show 24 it had 24 episodes of season but it was really,0.012000578
two arcs twelve episodes each episode twelve rolled into episode thirteen and the new arc,0.03754097
just like this movie does but it does feel like two different seasons just like,0.011385948
Black Panther feels like two different movies but in the end Black Panther was fantastic,0.07987259
it has your fun superhero stuff in it yeah but that's not what the movie,0.044079725
is it's not what it's about it really is about a king coming into the,0.021762813
throne and dealing with being a new king and while they're telling that story they,0.017715836
bring you in on a very interesting fascinating colorful and vibrant civilization I feel like,0.022624226
most people who go into Black Panther will enjoy Black Panther it's all about how,0.14209919
much you enjoy black panther are you going to like it or love it I,0.18876581
don't know this up to you but it's worth paying money for it's worth watching,0.03979927
and worth buying on blu-ray that's right that is a purple blue right because when,0.012140267
this movie comes out on blu-ray if the blue part of the blu-ray package isn't,0.028923515
purple that's a missed opportunity marketing people a lot of purple and black in this,0.023726435
movie personal favorite color scheme of mine or it's a black panther it is here,0.16463095
it is upon us have you seen it what did you think about it whatever,0.030547228
