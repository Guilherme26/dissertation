Blunt who is in the film as well the story is apparently Emily encouraged Krinsky,0.023990514
to direct the film after reading the first draft of the script and then also,0.005831
asked if she could start opposite him in the film also apparently the original screenplay,0.026176972
only had one sentence of dialogue so this will be really interesting going into the,0.02584571

was great Dean actually even liked it himself you thought it was quite good yeah,0.03396095

because that's exactly what we wanted to hear from like a non horror lover just,0.03241041
to be clear guys this is not gonna have any spoilers at all just because,0.035493534
I know a lot of you guys won't see this til next week and I,0.036246523
just kind of want to give you my shorthand review talking about technique acting and,0.045815855
structure not really the content of the film the story though is about what I,0.028936818
thought it was about that's as much as I'll say the tension in the film,0.027287163
was amazing and I think that that was definitely made by the actors Emily Blunt,0.036421467
was like such a standout for me the situations that they get into his dire,0.13234892
and is in saying as I said before earlier that there wasn't gonna be much,0.026186284
talking in the film that is definitely correct and it was such a good film,0.012459555
to see in the cinema because of that although you got to be careful what,0.021482106
session you go to because I could imagine if someone was talking or you've been,0.063079365
eating something loudly the guys on their phone yeah there was a guy in front,0.074533165
of me he was on he's fine but I guess the light wasn't as bad,0.053241964
as I think the sound would have been to affect the situation and the feel,0.018335788
of the film there was a guy next to me eating popcorn and it definitely,0.030439468
took me out a couple of times but the film was such like a simple,0.05513774
kind of story and all of the actors and characters were really straightforward definitely because,0.012997023
the sound design of the film was such a huge aspect of the film they,0.011479739
really played with it and they brought in some music and then they also had,0.017438455
like a lot of like highs and lows and it definitely kept you on the,0.031927485
edge of your seat but the main thing for me was just it was a,0.03500662
straightforward story but the tension was just done so well I just thought it was,0.019040216
amazing I think those are good balance cuz normally for those high tension movies if,0.046421837
you sit through them for too long even if they're gripping the whole time you,0.13495845
feel exhausted like having anxiety for the entire movie right and you're just exhaust at,0.038550053
the end of it so it wasn't like that but at the same time it,0.032425042
wasn't like I felt quite short even though it was it was very kind of,0.0698516
movie yeah it was a very concise storyline that is quite heartbreaking at points and,0.023494286
very straight forward but it just definitely yeah you hold some tension and you throughout,0.052944627
the whole time and wow I feel like Emily Blunt was just such a standout,0.026128413
for me I don't know if you felt the same I thought she was amazing,0.09126652
this movie and I I've seen her in a lot of movies but I never,0.04647106
thought much of her this film like she was amazing they know anything was that,0.07031324
they showed the trailer before yeah but I watched a bit of the trailer which,0.024474768
I know that you tried not to it actually I thought it gave away the,0.055260796
movie and then when I watch the movie it didn't so if you feel like,0.020697854
you've watched the trailer and it's giving away the movie you don't have to worry,0.0454826
that it hasn't actually I guess all in all I want to say definitely check,0.013720743

up the film was beautiful obviously the sound mix was amazing but the emotion of,0.037858263
the characters are really what pulled it through for me I'm gonna give this one,0.034324806
an 8 out of 10 I thought it was an amazing film scare school I'm,0.07815974
gonna give it a 7 just because of the tension it was just the stress,0.023245508
levels during that film was like insane Andra jolly I'm gonna give it like a,0.08522732
it's like a 6 or 7 maybe like a and I'll give it a 7,0.03635428
I'd say it's about a 6 for me really yeah I thought you liked it,0.03369621
yeah that but man you have different right I don't like about something it's under,0.0524331
50% okay I think that if you do want to take somebody who is scared,0.20537145
of horror films Dean can say it's not the scariest horror film you've definitely seen,0.06400996
