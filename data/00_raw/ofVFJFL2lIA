hi I'm Andre and I'm a black nerd and this is a first impressions review I got to go to a press screening for spider-man into the spider verse and the embargo has officially lifted on it but the movie doesn't come out it's like December 14th so it'll be a spoiler free as possible I'm not gonna get into too much details I'm just gonna let you know how I feel about this movie because I gotta let you know how I feel about this movie because oh my god this movie I freaking love this movie Oh Andre you love every movie that is not true I do not think that all movies are fantastic but I do love this movie and I gotta say it's nice loving this movie knowing that I went in a little concern I wasn't like worried but I was a little concerned because let's break it down it's another spider-man movie how many of those have we had it's an animated spider-man movie we've had animated spider-man TV shows and it's an animated spider-man film from Sony the company that gave us the emoji movie so needless to say had my concerns and gonna be completely honest here first trailer it was a different style of animation and I was really trying to figure out what was going on with it now seeing the final product oh my god the animation in this movie it breaks all contradictions on 2d animation on 3d animation it is without question the true definition of a living comic book there are so many things that happen when you're watching this movie that is just amazing in the sense of animation I know I'm gonna use a word amazing a lot and I'm sorry my spider-man but it's not a pun it's just how I feel all the different ways that the colors are popping out all the different ways the characters move around when words pop up there's a couple of times watching this movie where I was like checking my glasses cuz I'm like am I in a 3d movie right now I feel like it because so many different layers and colors and things are popping out so crazily that I thought I was in 3d it's hard to describe it you just have to see it it is beyond anyone's belief of what they would have expected out of animation with this movie I am not kidding with you right now on the animation alone this movie deserves a Best Animated Oscar nomination hands down this movie gets snubbed like lego movie did for best animation Oscar nomination I'm gonna be a little upset because this movie does something with animation that we have not seen in a feature-length animated film in quite some time some of you didn't watch cartoons on TV may feel a little bit like okay this is a big-budget version of some stuff I've seen on TV before but for most people this is gonna be like whoa whoa are you trying to hate on Sony animators but I feel like the B team worked on the other movies they're like oh you were real good anime uh yeah we're gonna mo G ain't workin hotels resume yeah you you you get over here resi I'll go work on that Popeye movie that we're never gonna put out it is style and substance this is the origin story of Miles Morales as spider-man it is so well done it was really cool I mean we've got a lot of origin story movies about Peter Parker the movie itself even kind of jokes about that a little bit so it was nice to see how they did miles the story who he is as a character how he has a different background how he is as a person how his family is you know all the different things about him and what happens when he now has to take on the roles of being spider-man or learning how to become spider-man what's nice about his character is that he's not just a great character he's also a great avatar for us the audience what would we do in this situation how will we fill in the situation miles does that throughout the movie which is good because some crazy stuff happens in this movie I'm not gonna go too much into it because I don't know how many trailers you've seen but it is called spider-man into the spider verse so make your assumptions as you will and I was worried that because of some of these outlandish things that happens in this movie could that take away from the mild storyline and what's nice about this movie is that it doesn't it always comes back to Myles he is the the way to keep this craziness grounded and that's awesome they did a really good job with that I'm glad that we were able to have some fun with this some craziness with this and yet still be a great story about Myles about his family about his becoming spider-man just all of it I almost don't want to hype up too much this movie because I know as much as I keep hyping this up you know you're gonna have that person to be like I can't be that great and they're gonna go into the movie completely looking for nitpicks so I'm sorry if I'm sounding a little bit overhyped but I can't stress enough how much I love this movie and it is a Spider Man movie so expect some spider-man references like a lot like a ton like on Lego Batman level of spider-man references characters meta humor this movie is a love letter to the spider-man franchise and what's nice about it is if you're not well versed well spider versed in all of spider-man's lore and I mean all of spider-man's Lord don't worry it's still entertaining you're still gonna be like oh that's cute that's funny that's neat that's cool you're gonna still enjoy it if you're with someone who really knows a lot about spider-man you will be like oh dad they put that in home I got some issues like you're gonna be like that so that's really cool that it works on different layers and without saying too much because I don't know how many trailers people have seen you definitely get the variations of a character and because you have variations on a character you get to play again with the animation with different styles you get some 2d stuff some 3d stuff there are some times where it almost feels kind of stop-motion like anime inspired Looney Toon slash classic Saturday morning cartoon inspired like everything in some way gets represented both in spider-man and in animation that black panther soundtrack it's a great soundtrack but I'm telling you what spider-man in the spider verse was like hold on one second I would like to add a few more songs to your Spotify playlist if I may please and I'm talking about like some new school stuff some old school stuff some comedy stuff I'm like alright when this track comes out I'm ready for it oh but I'm trying it's a black Latino spider-man are they gonna really shove that down my throat how do they handle the representation you know how they show representation this movie they show it like it sits there like it exists kind of like how it exists in the real world like that's that's it that's how it's done no big speeches you know no big like haha metaphor is just he exists he's a person that exists I know it's shocking turns or issues it is very fast-paced coming from a guy who talks really fast on the internet it's very very fast-paced if we prepare for that um if you had a problem with the screen Slayer seen in Incredibles - there might be a couple of times in this movie where you may want to just be careful with your eyeballs I'm just gonna tell you it just as a precaution I'm not trying to diagnose or anything I'm pretty sure for most people gonna be fine I just want to put that out there because it is a movie that has a lot of colors a lot of things going on at one time so for some people that might be just something to just at least know about just be aware of and I just wanted more I just wanted more of it like I love this so much when it was all over I was like huh I want more of this Oh stay stay to the credits stay to the very very end for you know things and stuff and surprises whatnot Woody Harrelson in a wig now I really enjoyed this movie I definitely wanna see it again when it's officially out loved it loved it loved it loved it one of my favorite animated movies 2018 one of my favorite movies are 2018 one my favorite spider-man movies period I know that sounds overhyping but I really absolutely love this movie I personally did do you want to see this movie yes you do know I know you can make your own decision my opinions are always my opinions I'm never forcing you to have the same thoughts as me that being said you better go see this movie no but seriously I had a great time watching this I hope
