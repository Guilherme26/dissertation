so we've had enough time to soak in the movie black panther came out I,0.24034938
believe February 16th of this month did I really just say I said February 16th,0.03333592
of this month it came out this month and I just saw it for the,0.06109786
second time and I plan to go see it again this weekend just to get,0.054741986
my one last my one last shot and I've done this with a few movies,0.29914176
like Rise of the Planet of the Apes interstellar the wolf of Wall Street I've,0.31089434
done this with a couple movies not tons that I will literally go back and,0.1969666
see like multiple multiple times and I know Black Panther is probably the most anticipated,0.09980558
movie of 2018 judging by how I perform at the box-office judging by you know,0.056195285
the the reception on social media on review platform so I wanted to make this,0.05250778
video just to give my take on the movie the reception you know responding the,0.080271885
reception and just a quick overview of what the film was about I know a,0.036339674
lot of people wanted to know my thoughts on it so here we go Black,0.27458563
Panther for those who don't know is a Marvel superhero but in this movie touch,0.11537038
all the the protagonists here is portrayed less as a hero and more of a,0.11416322
a king with very internal conflicts so the film basically starts off in California and,0.055245407
hood and T'Challa father goes to see his brother two toddlers uncle and the conversation,0.29624674
starts off good but it ends up turning into a berating session when when two,0.100735016
challahs uncle realizes that the the his right-hand man has been a spy for from,0.17167822
Wakanda the entire time and the movie pretty much starts out with an Jobu arguing,0.06404341
that black people in general will fare a lot better just in that country in,0.52039385
that system if they had the tools necessary to prop themselves up above the rest,0.09961934
he acknowledges that there is a lot of segregation a lot of racial divide and,0.2743952
attempt to prevent certain people from prevailing by not giving them the same tools as,0.16070522
other people within that same land so he's the one who's basically giving that information,0.064481825
to claw the film essentially starts off like that that's gonna be the the precursor,0.06474463
for majority of the conflict within the Black Panther movie all you idiots in the,0.9156528
comment section that we're going crazy talking about oh man y'all really think Black Panther,0.59834385
is gonna be about black people to some extent like shut up you haven't even,0.7370042
seen the film yet and why wouldn't it be a statement about that it's obvious,0.042967446
you looks too - Chawla after reuniting with Nakia goes back to Wakanda - you,0.31928435
know except his place on the throne he's challenged by Baku who I don't really,0.16335322
like the challenging system in this movie at all I mean if the purpose of,0.056744076
this movie is to be ruled by a good king I thought you should have,0.14999463
been judged by character not by brawn or by brute strength if that is the,0.12913421
case anyone with any whacked-out ideology could easily take the throne unless of course they're,0.30444086
saying you have to be from a specific tribe in order to be up for,0.14887345
consideration guess kill monger from what I know went into it and was able to,0.5534542
challenge - Charla pretty much based off his bloodline as we continue in the film,0.13046712
were introduced to characters like Everett what kabhi a Cole a Sheree I would say,0.11034077
there are elements of this movie that actually reminds me of The Dark Knight Rises,0.08924946
the woody sarcastic responses from shiri are kind of what I would get from an,0.2782377
Alfred or or a fox she's like the combination of those two characters in my,0.15694757
opinion so I think her character is awesome although the fight between Batman and Bane,0.10197
was pretty anti-climatic in my opinion there is a defeat of T'Challa arise and a,0.16305456
defeat of Erich kill monger as we progressed with the film were introduced to Erich,0.24016555
kill monger who was portrayed by Michael B Jordan in this film we find out,0.75754386
the Erik's true goal was never to work under Klaw it was just to offer,0.059191
Klaus a sacrifice to Wakanda so that he could be taken to see T'Challa so,0.1916357
that he could challenge him so that he could become the king take the throne,0.1516224
and thence in vibranium to other places of the world so that their people could,0.20330393
all thrive in all nations I'm very empathetic towards a character like Erik kill monger,0.5876557
because when you look at him you see someone who is a product not only,0.15253264
of their environment but someone who wants to see their people thrive you can see,0.08718648
with his time in office although short lives was not spent tormenting the people of,0.23979822
Wakanda it was spent honestly trying to use their resources Erik kill monger went about,0.40320092
his process in a completely wrong way you see that he ended up taking the,0.1410666
wrong approach which ultimately led to his downfall unfortunately Erik tries to be a dictator,0.44576848
as opposed to trying to be a king and that's probably one of the biggest,0.11020866
downfalls of the movie itself is that Erik kill monger doesn't come at this from,0.40338472
a very strategic standpoint at all for him to have been working towards this goal,0.08660556
for so long you would have thought he would have better planned it maybe tried,0.111337736
to get more people on his side maybe try to get more of what condemnation,0.1520323
to understand him I feel like his methods would have been better accepted had he,0.10897715
come at this from the standpoint of a king and less of a dictator I,0.31089434
have to give props to what in my opinion maybe the most underrated character in,0.06418525
this entire movie and it might possibly be the best portray as a koi a,0.09174547
that's played by Danai gurira i think her name is in every scene she's in,0.08867237
she dominates in the comedic effect and the sarcastic effect and the action affect her,0.10070345
fight scenes are probably the best in the entire film of course there's not a,0.104926266
lot of emphasis put on her character as she is a side character but still,0.06606266
she does the best in this movie to me and she's the most badass she,0.31952298
literally uses one of her Spears to hold on to the top of the car,0.13440596
that is being driven by Nikita in an attempt to catch claw in harpoons a,0.106425576
truck another thing to point out about Erik kill monger is his resolve he literally,0.47182998
kills his girlfriend or his love interest which immediately reminds me of the Sasuke that,0.81340843
was pulled on our tail where he tells Kody and everything's gonna be okay and,0.15141131
stabs her through the heart just to get danza some of you might not know,0.6364068
what that is I'm a bit of a weeaboo but still it shows how clear-cut,0.31477916
his method to get revenge is he finally meets up with the charla they fight,0.31858197
- Charlie loses in a really really bad way Zuri is also killed in this,0.31691912
fight which to me I guess is impactful for T'Challa as far as the audience,0.13301861
is concerned I don't think we had enough time with Zuri to really care about,0.10111063
him dying like that and I would have thought Erik kill monger would have taken,0.794439
his time with Zuri since he is the one who ended up getting his father,0.15511976
killed he throws to Chara over the edge takes his place on the throne in,0.5876557
decisis to send vibranium or weapons with vibranium to the rest of the world so,0.18416086
that black people all over the world can thrive and survive and be on top,0.69542736
of course we find out that Sharla isn't actually dead he's actually saved by Baku,0.18155217
Nakia ends up getting one of the heart-shaped herbs trying to give it to Baku,0.10484806
because she doesn't actually know that T'Challa is alive once they figure it out they,0.19261508
give it a shower he wakes up he's ready to fight he goes back home,0.25970605
ready to take one kill monger everyone fights all this movie proved your allies become,0.69542736
your enemy there was no other army this is literally just whoa copy and a,0.15692547
koi yay end up fighting pretty much their army is pretty much on the battlefield,0.14424755
no one else is here the real enemy is kill monger in the east one,0.4788631
guy to Chawla and kill monger have their round two to Chawla wins by stabbing,0.7093121
Erik in the heart he's in praised by kil monger because apparently you know flipping,0.38830113
over a knife and stabbing me in the heart with it was a good move,0.74115294
instead of just killing him on the spot T'Challa takes Eric to a sunset because,0.6725525
that's what his father has always wanted him to see he sees it he acknowledges,0.11650793
it as beautiful vintage Charlotte says hey we can still save you Eric kill monger,0.7327197
delivers what might be the best line in any Marvel movie in history before his,0.14290336
death just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped off the boats,0.7202121
because they knew death was better than bondage and that one line right there proves,0.44969818
the entire difference between the character T'Challa and Eric kill monger one who wants to,0.44726434
see his people free and one who wants to see his people exist T'Challa ends,0.31089434
up taking on Eric kill mongers methods in the end of the film by going,0.5905787
back to California in the hood and buying a couple establishments in order to help,0.0552965
out their situation and that's essentially the movie in what I could say I hope,0.08859371
was about five minutes so after seeing it twice there were a few things that,0.06833428
I definitely could appreciate one of those things first being the connection between how Black,0.14372785
Panther and Wakanda deals with immigrants and how America deals with immigrants the whole purpose,0.14862648
of Wakanda was to preserve and protect their own people they really got into anyone,0.09691244
else's business and they made sure to stay secluded from the rest of the world,0.080065876
here at kill monger references this in the film you guys are up here sitting,0.38739526
nice and pretty but our people are out there dying and in the street and,0.36502025
their excuses we don't know who they are and we can't have people coming in,0.15535496
here that could threaten our lives and immediately there's a connection between that and how,0.23957457
America is dealing with the current immigration situation unfortunately though for America what Conda has,0.09054823
never participated in any other world events while America has another thing I love about,0.09529517
this movie is how it holds on the African culture like those African roots while,0.40332174
still advancing at the same time truly you can still hold the one two something,0.059341338
in an advance simultaneously it's an afro futuristic film one that pays a lot of,0.14904673
homage to the African lineage while also saying hey we can you know keep up,0.16200271
with the times as well another selling point for this film is how much stronger,0.08973357
the Wakanda people seem to be from knowing their path thus knowing what should be,0.10339723
important in what to protect having responsibilities etc you see Eric kill monger in this,0.5578528
film was a lot angrier he he has a point to prove there is nothing,0.31089434
that he really values I mean in the beginning of the film he even destroys,0.31089434
his own love interest there is nothing that this dude holds close to him and,0.23542179
that's because he doesn't know who he is he doesn't know what he wants to,0.11030845
protect he has a goal in mind of wanting people to have come out of,0.12488509
a certain situation but unlike the people of Wakanda he doesn't actually know who he,0.077904925
is or where he stems from which makes his character even better because he can,0.06830251
identify what those are the people that live in America that have no idea where,0.15635347
they come from either I mean watching this film it makes you really upset if,0.10307131
you were ever here that argument from someone that you shouldn't be upset about slavery,0.3727433
because you weren't affected by it do I don't even know my last name I,0.084659375
can't go back ten generations and still know exactly where I stem from any man,0.106926195
or woman is a million times greater when they know who they are versus when,0.117909536
they do not and we currently have millions of black youth in America who have,0.6781213
no idea who they are of course you can define and shape yourself to be,0.114012465
the person you want to be I'm just saying lineage wise knowing where you come,0.077615865
from knowing who you are knowing who your ancestors were we can't obtain access to,0.07915338
that information but it's not available just on the fly we were raised and brought,0.03024646
up learning European culture we weren't brought up learning African culture learning what gods were,0.23959382
worshipped learning what internal conflict happened with African nations early on we didn't learn that,0.095408544
stuff and there wasn't easy access to it when you were 9 10 11 years,0.123695895
old that's the thing that's so bittersweet about this movie is even though it's fiction,0.12931786
it tells a story of what could have been had we as black people knew,0.4032088
respected valued then advanced our culture the amount of lists that could have evinced an,0.071140856
entire civilization is maddening to think about the wealth the culture the identity crisis we,0.21441755
be ending the sense of helplessness we'd be ending and the idea of togetherness that,0.19874845
we'd be sparking when you look at a movie like this it's just like so,0.110241905
motivating to see this many black people just living in a nation together and just,0.5154597
supporting one another even those people like Baku who disagree with the challahs method still,0.22649981
have a place where they can call home you know this movie impacts in a,0.06693702
different way than just something that's supposed to be a superhero movie because in the,0.05550481
film I like out to Chara isn't represented as a black panther like a superhero,0.1776176
but more as the conflict within his own nation I got to tell you people,0.1938315
that I went to go see this movie with we were said we reset when,0.06719472
we left the theater because we we acknowledged and looked at that and saw like,0.045898095
this this could this could have happened this could have been us of course not,0.06777443
superhuman strength or anything like that but having a nation where all of us support,0.1611523
one another without having something as devastating as being enslaved and having your identity in,0.2867881
your history stripped from you and forced to settle in that same country is it's,0.12018054
really maddening if things have been another way like it sucks of course we can,0.5338612
make that happen still but there's way too many of us that have already been,0.04533314
colonized I just love the duality of this movie I love how Eric Gill monger,0.15547852
is portrayed and how T'Challa is portrayed one character with a father one that knows,0.058591656
his history one that knows exactly who he is and what he needs to protect,0.062987484
versus one who doesn't know his history doesn't know exactly where he stems from doesn't,0.07361769
really know what to protect has a vision has no one to guide him or,0.06268387
hadn't had anyone to guide him because he's fatherless grew up in the u.s. that's,0.24063842
more of a common story in the u.s. it shows a parallel I feel of,0.09925412
one black man that could end up this way if he had this in one,0.55577505
that could end up this way if he doesn't have this so I love the,0.08152232
movie for the discussion that it sparks in the conversation that it brings up especially,0.06212882
us as black people you know looking at it from that point of view there's,0.39419416
so much about the film that you can appreciate be a little bit saddened by,0.1482643
at the same time but of course with all things none of this is perfect,0.10891597
although I do praise this movie for its strong statement there are elements of the,0.07781195
film that I just could have done without one of those elements being the really,0.09757005
crappy at moment CGI that's done with the film especially during the fight with Eric,0.40990424
kill monger and T'Challa sometimes it's just noticeably oh six like really bad graphics at,0.6357589
some points and I know a lot of people might not notice it but if,0.068622746
you have a friend who's like a graphic designer or if you've watched movies that,0.14952724
really focus highly on that quality like if you've seen the movie interstellar you'll see,0.10505318
how beautiful cinematically these movies look I think the camerawork is amazing I love the,0.096310906
way though the land looks it's beautiful although there are some good acting in the,0.068272516
film I do think that at some points Michael B Jordan scared Aric kill monger,0.53490317
is a little bit over acted there's sometimes heavy emphasis placed on lines that are,0.060705744
just awkward to me like when Eric says he's gonna kill T'Challa or when he's,0.69542736
stripping himself down getting ready to fight I get that he's angry but at some,0.24238539
moments in the film the anger doesn't come off authentic it comes off as very,0.079910666
forced there are some moments in the film where Michael B Jordan acting does redeem,0.05284811
itself like the opening scene where he first gets introduced where he's acting very normal,0.188688
and everything seems to just roll off the tongue especially is hey auntie lion when,0.16066945
he goes and meets up with T'Challa that was hilarious and I might speak to,0.099981725
that not being who Michael B Jordan really is I mean maybe Chadwick Boseman was,0.15226622
so easily portrayed as T'Challa in the film because that's a lot of who he,0.10098412
really is another thing in this film that I didn't really like was Klaw being,0.061811756
executed so early in the film I mean for him to have caused so much,0.40320706
havoc in regards to what Conda for him to be taken out so easily in,0.15386838
for him to not expect it was just really weird to me you have a,0.16724028
guy here who has information about what Conda who who's got someone on the inside,0.16027021
and he doesn't expect to be betrayed at any point I think he's killed literally,0.5876557
like within the first 40 minutes of the film the fight scenes are a little,0.09208465
bit anticlimactic now I did actually enjoy the fight scene between T'Challa and Baku he,0.29043683
had his own good reason for won in a fight to chala just feeling like,0.094256006
T'Challa isn't a good leader having technical developments be from a child pretty much was,0.1243866
one of his main concerns so everything he was saying was reasonable he also put,0.12431188
up a good fight but he's spared by de Charla in the end how the,0.11717547
fight scenes that T'Challa actually participates in I think that was the best one the,0.15495034
fight between him and Erik kill monger is really anti climactic in the end for,0.48504376
me not a lot is going on not a lot is happening correct me if,0.11044298
I'm wrong but if they are having their powers of the Black Panthers set before,0.24204837
they begin fighting why wasn't T'Challa a little bit more hurt after he was stabbed,0.32834622
in the chest by a spear from Baku do walk that off like he didn't,0.18755199
even get touched same thing happened when he was thrown off a cliff dude had,0.3210306
every inch of his body sliced open and then was thrown off of a cliff,0.6242962
from however many stories high and somehow manages to have his body recover another question,0.05203288
I have about this film is if kill monger burned all the heart-shaped herbs in,0.67102385
T'Challa pretty much has the last one can they just make more or is that,0.06680338
just the end of the Black Panther I have my discrepancies with it obviously I,0.31089434
have my issues maybe there's some plot holes here and there maybe some things that,0.10016001
I don't like like the CGI being bad especially during some of the fight scenes,0.15656908
I just think the good really outweighs the bad in this film to me and,0.17609283
for everything that this film says and for all the possibilities that you could walk,0.076779775
out of the theater thinking about after viewing it I think it deserves what I'm,0.09756902
about to give it black panther the movie thank you guys for watching if you,0.35693657
enjoyed the movie please go watch it again go watch it one more time support,0.06748635
this movie it's made amazing money so far I want to see it reach a,0.098639876
billion it probably will be I'm going to go see it again this weekend just,0.04412271
to get one last good look at it I've already seen it twice but I,0.034012236
