opening theme and it permeates through the rest of the film the look of this,0.027465433
film was really engaging as well it's the first British production to use extensive location,0.03525473
shooting it was also the first British film and started to try and create the,0.07022277
neorealistic style of directors like Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini now Reed actually had three,0.16475002
film units on this particular shoot there was a daytime unit there was a nighttime,0.0813799
unit and interestingly there was a silly unit now he oversaw all three of those,0.15251863
particular film units which meant he was sometimes working up to about 20 hours a,0.019535778
day it showed how much he cared about this film and how much he exerted,0.06924961
his control over how it was made and I think the results speak for themselves,0.023556149
Reid was keen to give the film a very local feel beyond the location shooting,0.046280153
he'd used lots of locals in key extras roles you'll see in some key scenes,0.025528418
that balloon seller he was a local from Vienna police officers with Vienna sewer unit,0.087197594
so they were quite accustomed to working in those particular parts of the city and,0.015086365
the fire department played a really important role as well you'll notice a number of,0.014318078
the nighttime scenes the cobblestones the sidewalks the streets are wet Carol reused his lighting,0.14488432
and the reflection off those streets to really bring those nighttime scenes to life so,0.064023264
all these people played a really important role in the look with a film and,0.029065864
making it look as authentic as it actually is the other important aspect of this,0.043924738
film is the symbolism very early in the film Holly Martin's played by Joseph Cotten,0.010650256
walks under a ladder without hesitating it's a foreboding scene in which you sense that,0.042618982
he's going to have no luck during the rest of the film during a lot,0.029017972
of key scenes in the film Carol Reed uses what's what is called Dutch angles,0.022031548
so framing the shot in a way where things don't look square they look off-kilter,0.20159055
a little bit and that gives us a sense of unease that things aren't as,0.020419808
they seem equally with all the nighttime shooting and the shooting in the sewers there's,0.1877441
lots of shadows and and and things are moving in ways where we can't be,0.025702031
certain what's actually happening again that underlines the fact that I start as the story,0.013982825
goes we're not entirely certain what's happening at all times over now this is also,0.022606932
a great story it was written by Graham Greene it was the only original screenplay,0.02068189
he ever wrote he was sent to Vienna in 1948 by one of the other,0.05554217
producers Alexander Korda he wanted him to get a sense of the city and and,0.02285837
build a story for him around that now Greene did a number of tours around,0.030504657
the city including the sewers some of the city and Nights plots he spoke to,0.015985694
a lot of people and he got an understanding of how the black market worked,0.034296203
in Vienna as well and he incorporated a lot of those elements into the story,0.049155742
he also wrote a story which it was incredibly well structured it seems to be,0.022682097
to me a story in two parts we start out thinking we're dealing with the,0.034966707
murder mystery and then transitions into a crime drama again during the course of the,0.1723105
storytelling more and more as a real bet each of the characters that none of,0.022573672
them are what they seem and as a result we don't know who to trust,0.07740609
we don't know he did who to cheer for in a lot of ways we,0.048769936

the sewer he was played by a body double wells his greatest contribution to this,0.08227723
particular film is his cuckoo-clock monologue it's very famous it's one of the key elements,0.251781
of the film and again let's pause for a moment just to listen to that,0.014685259
