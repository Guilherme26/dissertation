"The one thing that I will say is is not a negative, but it's something that I was a little bit, maybe dissatisfied with is the way that the movie wraps up, because I thought that to me the way that they ended it made sense, but to me I was a little dissatisfied in the way that this movie kind of wraps itself up, because essentially these two characters after they have their romantic time together and they have this love for one another, they go on their separate ways, and essentially they don't ever really meet up again only in certain sir stances that I don't want to discuss, because I don't want to rob you of any spoilers or any potential spoilers for this film",0.18055865,0.9995988115212294,0.4462797619047619,0.059,False
