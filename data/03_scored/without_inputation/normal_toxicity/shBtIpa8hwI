right let's do a quick intro Miles Morales is bitten by a radioactive spider now he's got to learn what it takes to be the next spider-man and save the day before it's too late enough of that let's get right,0.11371375
into the good look,0.06354913
good now let's start off by talking about the animation in this movie it's a pretty slick 3d style that almost has the motion of old-school claymation despite not being the most traditional style of animation that many people might be accustomed to it definitely works,0.11112253
exceptionally well for the movie this animation helps accentuate different aspects of the movie more so from a visual standpoint more specifically the film flows in and out of different kinds of animation styles at times but in a very subtle,0.04986122
way what I appreciated the most was how at different times the film would just turn into a motion comic book having that literal comic book element really helps to add that unique touch that comic book readers are also familiar with the animation serves to be more of a practical medium to deliver on some of the more heavy concepts and themes,0.041453056
if this weren't an animated movie it would be really hard to imagine some of the sci-fi elements working in a live-action setting so rather than having to watch live actors in a movie full of crazy CGI effects,0.3625857
it becomes a lot easier for the audiences to buy into more of these psychedelic visual effects in this film now one of my biggest concerns going into this movie was whether or not,0.07763081
this was really going to be a Miles Morales story or not luckily it was as you could probably see in the trailer,0.062430307
there are a number of other characters in the film while I would have preferred more screen time for miles the time share wasn't all that bad while they each have their own fun and unique moments to shine none of them truly steal the spotlight away from miles as character you'll love the way miles learns about his powers and discovers what it truly takes to become a hero another surprising win for this movie with a really cool action sequence is that it had if you happen to see the post-credit scene in venom then you'll already know what I'm referring to as for the drama,0.07904498
this movie does have,0.067672
its fair share of feels - it was great to see how this spider man film was able to tap into the core elements that make the spider-man character so rich and deep even if you happen to know the outcome of certain situations for some characters it won't matter it doesn't take much to feel the pain loss and other emotional challenges that the characters,0.06867773
endure thankfully this movie wasn't a total downer and that's because it was actually pretty,0.15856503
funny,0.058378298
I suppose that is to be expected given,0.057584133
the fact that Lord and Miller had a hand in making this film,0.09087734
if you're a fan of the past spider-man movies then get ready to laugh your butt off as this film pokes fun at the spider-man movie franchise and drops a number of funny callback references don't laugh too hard though because you may miss out on some of the jokes seriously even the lyrics to the outro credits are pretty funny and before I forget the soundtrack for this movie was just perfect the music transitions seamlessly at different moments to amplify the setting or mood during scenes better yet every song sounds like something Miles,0.40310025
Morales would actually listen to as a result both the music,0.07530701
and the main character become a bit more relatable,0.07637639
now besides having the comedy the drama and the action,0.09747535
it's really the characters that serve to be the backbone of this movie shameik Moore was perfectly cast as Miles Morales and Jake Johnson was an ideal fit for this version of Peter,0.24084395
Parker that he portrays,0.093881465
I think the potential fan favorites that literally got me to laugh out loud will come from Nicolas Cage and John Mulaney spider-man characters okay enough of that let's get right into the bad the bad,0.10432173
now the only issue,0.1492861
I really have with this movie stemmed primarily from well the animation that I praised earlier while it is vibrant and colorful there's a bit of blurriness that occurs throughout the movie the best way to describe it would be like,0.0692121
if you ever walked into a 3d movie and forgot to put your 3d glasses on I'm pretty sure this,0.29514614
blurriness was done intentionally since it does maintain the character on screen to be in full focus either way,0.056439217
it's just a little bit distracting at times okay enough of that let's get right into,0.24492158
the reason the reason spider-man into the spider is hands-down the best spider-man movie to date,0.14942746
now I had heard people mention that before going into my screening and in my mind,0.12215633
I was like no way could this top spider-man to however I think it did fight a man into the spider-verse just does,0.17600285
so many things well that it's incredibly hard to deny its awesomeness,0.13610429
if you were halfway hesitant on seeing this just because it's animated worried not the content is definitely suited more,0.06971104
so for teens to adults,0.09656279
and I am so happy that this movie represented Miles Morales in an authentic and positive way I think this film helps his character live up to be the positive diverse representation that he was created to be this movie has everything a spider-man movie should have and it will only leave you wanting more,0.07621272
and I suppose Sony knew exactly what was going on because even before this movie's released they already greenlit the sequel which at this point,0.06782026
I cannot wait to see so when it comes to the rating for spider-man into the spider-verse,0.15278235
I've got to give it a 9 and a half out of 10 look if you're a spider-man fan comic book fan or if you're just interested in seeing a great story of a hero coming into their own then Spiderman into the spider verse is definitely the movie you want to go see I mean,0.14050135
