a little bit but honestly I think that was it um touching on gal gadot,0.3505591
acting I thought it was fine I think she's gotten better and better and there,0.10422809
were this is like miniscule so I'm like nitpicking because I really liked her as,0.14884658
Wonder Woman there are scenes where if we required her to really not act as,0.21620733
she's kind of in the background more where she didn't she just hadn't kind of,0.18629153
