let me have been in a quiet place because I would have been the first one dead okay because I can't go that long without talking and also too I have zero survival skills guys,0.35090253
I'm a goner hey everyone is chartres from paperweights and today i'm gonna be reviewing a quiet place which is directed by John Krasinski and it also starred Jack Rosinski Emily Blunt,0.073694944
and so this is actually John Krasinski's fourth I'm directing credit and I thought that he did a really good job with this film,0.114168584
so the movie centers around this family who is basically dealing with this new post world of film with creatures who will basically kill you and rip you to shreds if you make a sound okay,0.7467324
and so it basically goes through the conflicts that they're dealing with how are they surviving and how they're kids dealing with the higher the parents dealing with it,0.051782172
and then what happens when they actually have to come in contact with these creatures,0.13595472
and so the movie doesn't really give you that much of a backstory as to how these creatures got here,0.119620934
what happened,0.05228998
how'd everybody disappear or if everyone disappeared basically it starts off from date 89,0.14918713
and what I appreciate about this movie is it didn't waste time letting,0.116490275
you know what the consequences are if you make a sound if you make that one poor mistake how you're gonna have to deal with the consequences and they won't be pretty,0.09560246
and so I thought everyone did an amazing job in this movie Emily Blunt John Krasinski,0.10302145
they are,0.05215231
they are awesome,0.025493633
in this movie but I have to talk about these kids,0.10980251
yeah so first of all kudos to for the casting on actually casting a young deaf woman by the name of Millicent Simmons,0.24104139
I really enjoyed her character okay cuz you see that in order for them to communicate they have to sign to one another you're kind of wondering like how do they,0.18318114
all know the sign language,0.051661037
something you see that their daughter is actually deaf so it's almost as if with them dealing with having a deaf child it actually made them more successful in trying to survive what they're going through right now and so also to this little no joke and you know him using wonder he was also the young man in suburban hi-yah,0.21616665
these faces that he makes and this was makes the movie so good because they cannot make noise they have to rely a lot on their facial expressions to show their emotions this,0.1503295
one can't have me dying with the faces that he was making,0.25423917
and when you watch you you'll know exactly what I'm talking about but I thought the kids were really good,0.11218237
and then it also gave a different point of view from films like this because it is a horror movie but it's not like a horror like really gory,0.24168926
it's just horrible,0.42505005
this is a really like crappy situation to have to deal with and to see how parents especially will have to navigate through this with young children,0.4501297
and so that's what I found more terrifying in this movie and I felt as though there is like that one like family,0.07634331
remember,0.03785402
they got on my damn nerves in the movie and you'll know exactly who I'm talking about when you watch it because I'll just like get it together,0.6039378
okay cuz you're starting to make me mad and we got a lot of stuff that stick right,0.444948
now for you to be acting like this,0.15028262
but I thought that it was handled very well it gets you invested with the characters,0.05011111
and I think that's what made the movie more enjoyable,0.11212263
I would have to say this is kind of like a Walking Dead - the zombies mix with a little bit of signs because why say Walking Dead is just because hearing the silence and basically is just you surviving with your family and nobody else is,0.2807339
around and so that's why I kind of gave,0.077179424
me the Turner The Walking Dead feel mixed with the science that they have the creatures that,0.16988067
come,0.07296592
and so I just thought it was a really enjoyable movie now there are some points where I kind of just like free acid be so smart you're making a lot of dumb important decisions,0.5585325
but if they didn't make them before decisions,0.0898743
I guess you wouldn't have a movie okay but it was still annoying at times because I was just like you guys were like so smart and and McKinney and now it's just like what are you doing these things,0.15324406
and then there's also kind of a I would say a conflict,0.123323604
but in new situations they're kind of getting into,0.094621494
and I think every one of the movies kind of just like like why didn't you think this was a good idea,0.12604135
how did you even let this happen,0.109158464
you'll know when you see it,0.090293445
I'm not gonna spoil anything for you,0.18554603
