hey everybody stuff Koza here and today I'm gonna review us us is directed by Jordan Peele it is his second movie that he is directed after get out which was really well-received super good horror movie won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay so it's kind of a lot of pressure going into this movie knowing what get out did for him I was like okay where are you gonna go next and he went some places I am a huge horror fan I love horror movies I love all kinds of horror movies I think it's such a cool genre I really appreciate when a director gets it and figures out how to make a new creative fresh terrifying horror movie and i 100% believe that Jordan Peele gets it like he just pays mind I just want to get in there and understand what is happening there because this movie was so good I personally I liked it even more than get out I really did to me US has a very classic horror feel to it get out was a little bit more of a thriller or like a psychological thriller this is like a horror movie and I think it has a really great balance of feeling like it's new and fresh and unique while also feeling like a classic horror movie that isn't trying too hard to be something new he doesn't really put in social commentary like he did and get out it's just like a very straightforward but complex and super good horror movie I will say since there are so many different kinds of horror I would categorize this one as like a very suspenseful heart like it's sort of on the line between horror and thriller because it is thrilling and I would say for most of the movie like almost the entire movie I was sitting on the edge of my seat like clenching my fists because I was just so terrified for these characters and what was gonna happen to them because pretty much the entire movie they're like running from something the whole time it's very stressful there's never really any downtime I never felt bored there was not one moment that like took me out of it or slowed things down it was just very like I was always worried afraid or just like thinking really hard I think the concept is really cool like when I saw the trailer I was really excited to see it because it's like that you are your own worst enemy sort of thing and there's definitely a lot of metaphor in the movie to go along with that theme but it's not like too much it's like just enough to where I enjoyed it a lot I thought it was really well done lupa didn't young those performance was I just totally butchered her name not even either dragon but she was so so good like I knew she was good she has always been good but she was so good in this movie like I love when a movie has a badass mother protecting her children protecting her family and just like I will go to the end of the world to kill you because you tried to hurt my children and she's just so badass and her performance was amazing both as herself and as the weird doppelganger version of herself so good so so good she steals the show completely and she's really good at being in a horror movie because she's really good at making her eyes really big and just looking terrified she's also kind of creepy looking when she wants to be and it's just it's very impressive but honestly the entire cast was great like not one person was bad no one was flat everyone played a part that was important and great there's like really nothing I didn't like about this movie except for one small thing I felt like at times the dialogue wasn't written as well as it could have been at times it felt a little bit cheesy and I think there are two scenes in particular where there's just like a little bit too much explaining happening and I know when you have a complex movie like this you kind of need to have some kind of explanation at some point but there are two parts where there's things being explained and it was a little bit long for me and I felt like the writing for that scene was a little bit cheesy and it was just like I don't know it could just be my own personal preference but something was off about it and I was like I was like almost taken out of it but then it pulled me right back in and I was right back into it and it was totally fine so yeah other than that really tiny thing I thought this movie was nearly perfect it was so much fun this is a horror movie that I will 100% watch again recommend to friends it has a lot of fun twists and turns you don't really ever know where it's going or when it's going to end there were a few times where I was like okay this is the end right and then something else would happen ugh like oh we're still going okay and that was really fun for me it was just very unpredictable never knew what was coming and terrifying the entire time so that's it I loved us I'm gonna give it a 4.5 out of 5 let me know if you saw us in the comments below I would love to talk about this movie oh my god I have so many thoughts and I just need I need ah if you want to talk about this movie
