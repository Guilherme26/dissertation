was alfred hitchcock's first hollywood production alfred hitchcock was already a successful director in britain,0.24542592
he had made a lot of well-regarded british cinema in the 1930s with films such,0.042678848
as the man who knew too much the 39 steps and the lady vanishes hollywood,0.038709696
was starting to pay attention to alfred hitchcock's talents particularly david selznick who was hot,0.22590546

film of all time gone with the wind and so they ended up working together,0.029024623
on rebecca hitchcock's first hollywood production rebecca while not as monumental of a success has,0.12852612
gone in the wind was still a huge hit as well especially for putting hitchcock,0.23641737
on the map to talk to a larger wider audience than what he was doing,0.02336657
in england i am moving to hollywood got him a lot more attention from a,0.044361096
wider variety of film fans and moving into the us actually paid off as rebecca,0.027277187
won some academy awards as well particularly best picture and because of that alfred hitchcock,0.2520205
ended up making more signature films that really signified his talents creating iconic classics that,0.036867138
are still beloved to this day like their window vertigo north by northwest psycho the,0.13995863
birds none of these movies wouldn't be possible without rebecca so this is a very,0.02979291
influential film in hitchcock's filmography a very game-changing film in his filmography is it still,0.027611108
a masterpiece this very day let's find out together doing rebecca joan fontaine plays a,0.027589822

aristocratic whether were maxim de winter but upon moving into manderlay her groom's baroque ancestral,0.11470892
mansion she soon learns that his deceased wife rebecca haunts not only the estate but,0.059608437
the temperamental brooding maxim as well and besides joan fontaine this movie also stars lawrence,0.034636114
olivier george sanders judith anderson and gladys cooper so this was the first time i,0.23910838
had seen rebecca in a few years back when i was starting to get into,0.043952674
classic cinema i think about eight years ago now uh rebecca was one of the,0.03199733
first alfred hitchcock films ever watched i distinctly remember the first two alfred hitchcock films,0.25749242
i remembered watching rebecca and the birds the birds being the very first and rebecca,0.017516281
was one of the first hitchcock films i remember watching as well i was intrigued,0.1319618
to get into that one because i knew that it was the only alfred hitchcock,0.3126167
film to win best picture and i wanted to see what made the academy love,0.03891258
the film so much and watching rebecca it's pretty easy to see why i think,0.03432281
this is one of the more melodramatic films in hitchcock's filmography i guess because hitchcock,0.19995686
paired with david selznick who just did gone with the win this sweeping melodramatic epic,0.09536139
film one of the best films of its era and so him pairing with alfred,0.023719784
hitchcock to create a melodramatic romance but also very gothic and very psychological as well,0.30152917
i think they were a great pair now hitchcock has later come out and said,0.36970183
he was a little dissatisfied with the making of rebecca he didn't get full creative,0.030766074
control like he did in his later films he definitely had some tension with selznick,0.15159269
throughout the making of the film selznick wanted to do some things hitchcock want to,0.16899589
do some things and so there was a little bit of a tension between the,0.06861303
two but i don't feel any tension watching the film i feel like in the,0.027005125
final version of the film there's still a great balance between the psycho drama that,0.07794157
makes hitchcock films rewarding mixed with the melodrama that made uh david selznick a prominent,0.1812499
producer back at the time uh back in the day and i think it's a,0.02647963
pretty good match uh the cinematography in this film is very haunting throughout very atmospheric,0.034421925
and very gothic i really love the way uh the movie makes you feel the,0.03475651
presence of somebody who's never really on screen this rebecca character the former wife of,0.032769606
maxim who tragically died and everybody's comparing her to the new wife that joan fontaine,0.20830359
is playing and it just makes for a very unsettling film it's not a scary,0.03415585
film by any means it's more of a psychological thriller that where the fear in,0.056497373
the film is upon expectations it falls upon obsession it falls upon expectations where you're,0.018571261
trying to do your own thing but everybody's comparing you to somebody that they think,0.054834414
is better and that just makes for a very very creepy experience at times especially,0.040320106
the housekeeper character mrs danvers played by judith anderson we as soon as you see,0.060316194
her on screen she is one creepy woman very much obsessed with rebecca has like,0.2617451
a her own room shrine dedicated to this woman there's a little bit of creepy,0.26199132
undertones to her character when you're like how did this make it past the sensors,0.036592416
some of the stuff she says and the stuff she keeps but she is so,0.0312031
good in this role she's probably the scene stealer of rebecca because of how creepy,0.15716428
she is you also got like i said jim fontaine plays the young woman who,0.066428564
marries lawrence olivier and is struggling to do her own thing as the new wife,0.026890049
while struggling to learn more about the mystery of who rebecca was and why people,0.022187866
are obsessed with her and then there's a lot of crazy twists as well between,0.17361759
her relationship to maxim lawrence olivier there's a lot of good twists in this film,0.08549473
uh the romance in the film is uh pretty compelling throughout between joan and lawrence,0.025321545
olivier horns olivier is so good as maxim very much one of the best dramatic,0.074115425
actors of that time who committed to every role that he was in in such,0.049226917
a theatrical presence and it's another remarkable performance here in rebecca the very brooding shy,0.045195904
man struggling to cope with a loss so severe while also trying to find new,0.044442914
love and move on as well movie moves at a pretty good pace it's a,0.019861054
little bit slow at times and it's run time because of the nature of the,0.078837566
story but it all leads to a very rewarding payoff in the end i did,0.022798505
enjoy the twists and turns in regards to what really happened the the mystery surrounding,0.029305996
rebecca's death and what was really going on and what lawrence olivier's true feelings and,0.21997091
regards are and then uh some of the other mysterious figures that have had a,0.015183482
connection to rebecca there's another character that claims to be her cousin who is played,0.022067467
by george sanders if you're a disney fan you may know him as the voice,0.0428212
of sheer khan in the jungle book he shows up in the film and he's,0.066729225
pretty entertaining as well i enjoyed his small part as somebody that has his own,0.08125484
agenda and trying to solve the rebecca death and he has an interesting connection with,0.114951715
her as well which i'm not going to spoil but definitely want to take the,0.061793566
cousin term lightly here that's all i'm going to say the movie is very well,0.050638434
scored it has a very eerie score throughout and while this movie is not as,0.026385175
suspenseful or as intense as some of hitchcock's later films i do agree that when,0.21328847
hitchcock got full creative control he made some of the best movies of the golden,0.23582539
age of hollywood like look to psycho and vertigo rear window and some of the,0.1737739
very very best alfred hitchcock films but he was getting his start in hollywood i,0.124810405
get that and his first hollywood production still really good i did enjoy the mix,0.08698008
of the psycho drama the melodrama the gothic atmosphere it's still an excellent atmospheric watch,0.097159386
i don't know if it would have been my pick for best picture that year,0.03091441
because 1940 i know the great dictator came out that year i love that film,0.122149006
from charlie chaplin uh the grapes are raph is another excellent drama that came out,0.0641716
that year i like those movies a little bit more than rebecca and i think,0.066763155
they probably would have been my picks for best picture one of the two of,0.019138664
course the academy doesn't care for animation films if if it was a truly fair,0.039245836
year like pinocchio or fantasia should have been in there in the running as well,0.06910925
but rebecca is a really great film nonetheless it's one of my favorite alfred hitchcock,0.25411212
films i know it's not the best alfred hitchcock film but i'm strangely attracted to,0.08668673
it and i think it's because of the atmosphere the atmosphere in this film really,0.040558908
sells the movie for me and every time i've rewatched it i've really really dug,0.06842279
it and i do appreciate rebecca even more on every rewatch that i see of,0.04543005
it so if you have not seen rebecca and if you're an alfred hitchcock fan,0.3537611
this is a good film to check out your enjoyment of the film depends on,0.0126930345
i guess your experience with it but for me this is one of the best,0.027206676
