roma Roma movie directed by Alfonso Karim he also directed gravity and eat - mama - Dom BIA and stars Lisa I appreciate and marina de terraria and it starts with a family and a housekeeper set in the Colonia Roma neighborhood in 1970 Mexico City I'm going to talk about it,0.095427066
right now so Roma is a ambitious movie which is a black-and-white film directed by Alfonso Curran and the film is a very slow pacing movie which takes you through the lives of family and the housekeeper for about two years and one thing about,0.0072166235
this channel I'm going to do I'm not going to involved spoilers in,0.19655675
the beginning I will talk about some spoilers toward,0.06628691
the end but there will be a warning at,0.08350837
the bottom but for now talk about the movie itself and overall the movie is a,0.083078854
slow burn it is all black and white pan and scan and one shot takes so what you'll see is a film where there would be a scene that goes on for maybe three to four minutes and it's all one take and the camera will pan left to,0.24040452
right slowly and then back again and it's a very very unsettling approach because you're feeling like you're a voyeur and it's like,0.18608609
there's no tilt with the camera,0.054955944
it's all pan and scan mainly and the shots that are stable are tend to be behind things or back off from the subject and you don't really quite see reactions,0.08071823
and the thing about the film is interesting is it's a very artsy film,0.10474426
and you wonder what this thing is going because it just deals with these people you kind of have to really follow along it's in Spanish,0.067004405
so you could have to read the subtitles,0.06951892
but of course when you do that after a while it becomes second nature okay in the category of story or depth,0.05360791
this movie doesn't really have a lot of that is it's a lot of it cerebral and and a one out of ten I had to give this movie a five in that regard because it's just averaged it's a character development story with no clear plot direction,0.10886684
it's just a life of these people as it is over,0.30171812
the course of a couple of years in a category of emotional impact,0.061534185
now this is probably where the movie is at the strongest,0.074707136
it's because without giving anything away through the first two acts of the movie you're basically following this housekeeper mainly through her eyes and the family of the people that she is attending and they get involved in things along the way that are traumatic and you end up really feeling for these characters and identifying with these characters,0.06655855
so by the end of the third act when things start going crazy you start really feeling that because you feel like they're part of your family,0.31729877
and so in this regard I give it an 8 out of 10 which is pretty high which means there's a strong emotional pull and that's very important for a movie because if it doesn't make you feel something then what's the point really you're watching it in a category of intangibility z-- it's my term of putting the things that make movies special in of themself,0.11519563
I like bringing it movies like Footloose the original what a movie really wasn't really good but because of the soundtrack and because some of the dance scenes similarly to dirty dancing not really a great movie but because you have a couple of good actors that we had to get chemistry on-screen,0.23791803
and of course the soundtrack makes the movie much better than it was,0.07203829
and so he's probably call the intangibles and it can vary from anything it can be a great direction,0.07865059
it can be great scene or so forth,0.05609256
but this particular film I give it,0.10384035
a seven because it's a masterful film in terms of how it with shots,0.17360073
how it slits the pan and scan thing that it does constantly it's annoying,0.17944898
but by the third act you will understand with you quickly why it's doing that and it pays off in the end,0.10595836
it's really brilliant work of a camera movement you probably wouldn't work on most films but for this one I think it was actually,0.097705066
so yeah,0.05474552
so yeah I give a seven for intangibility in a category on watchability this is word it's pretty weak,0.19135818
because you see at one time you pretty much done I give it a five now this could change in that area but I don't want to rush back to watch this movie anytime soon so a 5-4 watch building my overall rating which is a weighted average against,0.10194418
the other four,0.060031135
this is a really big piece of it,0.09743517
it's kind of when you see a movie what you feel after you see it what's your overall impression,0.14923179
I give it a 6 which is better than average and so weight against the others the movie comes out in pretty good footing my conservators take on Roma and by the way from here on out we're gonna have the spoiler section here,0.14796561
so if you don't wanna know anything about the movie specifically just fast-forward to the end or check the time index and jump above to where you want to go for the review in terms of my conservative take on this film just that much booty to to be ball cat this movie is based on the experiences from the director himself and so I don't have any reason to give that a negative mark so for the most part I'm giving this movie a green light the deal with the movie and the pan and scan toward the end when the kids are in the ocean and they're about to drown,0.13166755
you don't know where they are and how pans off camera and comes back to them,0.36136764
that's probably the most important aspect of this film is the most powerful aspect to this film,0.07634812
and it kind of ties in all that direction toward the end,0.05181794
and so I think that over ways everything that the love of a housekeeper who had her own problems with her miscarriage which by the way is a really really powerful scene that if you don't get emotional in that then you probably don't have a pulse a person who loves these kids as if they were her own and risks her own life,0.13848886
because she can't swim to save these kids that's that's that's the movie that's that's the crux in the movie,0.12350177
so my final take on this film is a score of 12.5 which translates to three stars out of four or three-and-a-half stars out of five,0.060451202
so with that coming below,0.120024815
