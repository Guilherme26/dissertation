what's up everyone welcome back to another episode of Sabrina talks I hope you're doing,0.094869874
well I want to say I have Pride Month to all my LGBTQ people my friends my loved ones all of y'all,0.40314606
I hope it has been a good pride,0.15203552
I know the world another worlds car going crazy but I hope you find some time to find some joy and some love for yourself and for the community this month,0.2561048
now I originally really wanted to start kick off this month,0.44111463
on the second but you know the world was the world had other plans,0.089283064
so I took a week off because we we wasn't doing that,0.06801011
so we're back we're a little more sane and we're excited to talk about moonlight that moonlight is a film directed by Barry Jenkins,0.15188667
they came out in 2016 it's based off of a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney titled in moonlight black boys look blue all night is a story about a young black man named shyrone and he's growing up in the 1980s in my hearing you see three sections of his life where he is a child where he's a teenager,0.075995475
and when he's an adult as with most coming-of-age movies,0.21902937
he's kind of figure out who he is where he fits into the world and where he kind of fits in with his environment,0.21501678
you might have heard of moonlight back in like 2017 during Oscar season because they had a whole fiasco at the Oscars where the announcer said the wrong title for the award originally they said la-la-land,0.103578426
and the Academy Award for Best Picture la-la-land it was like oh just kidding it's actually moonlight,0.038499992
so they ended up actually winning,0.082419544
the award there's a mistake moonlight,0.18793908
you guys won Best Picture this is not a joke,0.08929332
moonlight is won Best Picture the Oscars Fiasco aside let's talk about my thoughts on this movie let me give you a little background this movie came out in 2016,0.11747724
but at the time I thought oh this looks interesting but in 2016,0.057967916
I wasn't really in two movies like I am nowadays,0.11359528
I was just like especially Oscar movies cuz I was like hmm this is probably gonna be some like bougie pretentious hoity-toity kind of movie that I'm just gonna be sitting here like,0.13581777
what was that supposed to mean to me,0.06613408
so I kind of just brushed it off for a little bit,0.22872591
and then the word season came around and it was getting some acclaim,0.06963827
but I was like oh I need to go watch that,0.05710266
and then I think I just you know you'd be having the list of movies that you're like,0.08496399
oh,0.046070345
I need to go watch this,0.06273338
and then at some point your list gets too long you starts again some that's where I wasn't moonlight,0.10647204
so I attempted to watch the one year,0.06781543
my best friend we both,0.027922094
I don't know something happened with the internet,0.119503506
it was acting funky,0.2776677
we're never watching it,0.07467245
so come bleep me I'm finally like oh I want to finally watch something like,0.25739852
oh oh I can watch it and then review for Pride Month because I knew it was an LGBTQ story,0.1350416
so I was like this would be perfect,0.1084338
so I watched it fell in love,0.08245135
I love this movie it's so good like there's like movies that are good there cuz you know they entertain you,0.124477446
and they kind of make you laugh,0.11400397
and they're just like,0.05011477
oh well that was you know a fun old time,0.08434291
but this movie is just beautiful like,0.07298223
it is a work of art to me it's it's like,0.06696234
it's the epitome of like oh film you know there's like movies and there's films this to me is like oh film one of the things I love is that it's such a subtle movie like the main themes of the movie is not hitting you over the head you're not getting smacked by you,0.19575582
every five seconds you're not sitting here like oh my god,0.27667928
okay,0.050967902
I get it director,0.05459706
I know what you're trying to say like the story encompasses a boy's life,0.12520248
so it feels realistic everything about it is not you know,0.09450595
usually in some movies that want to hit you with a message,0.23780411
they like message take this message and you're like all right,0.08936612
you know I got you I see you,0.10826257
but this one it's like and it's just it's so it's just so subtle that I love it so much,0.06701809
there's a bunch of topics that I just kind of illustrated in the background or in like a subsection of the fire,0.15485407
I guess you want to say that you don't fully paying attention,0.17785268
until you may be watching a couple times or you're like hmm,0.12318089
I would if they were trying to say this about that or if they were trying to give an example of something like this,0.104445346
so like two topics at least I saw in the movie is the showing of like the school to Prison Pipeline and masculine in black culture the masculine you want is a little more shown but the school to Prison Pipeline drugs in neighborhoods living up in a poor neighborhood all of those kind of combined together and it's just background or like little pieces of the plot but you're so focused on the characters that you're like oh wait a minute like they're trying to say they think they just proved that or they're trying to say that or like,0.15515941
oh I love it,0.06597169
"now speaking of the movie focusing on its characters this will be such an intimate movie like you're really up close and personal for a lot of the shots you're really only focusing on so much characters like there's not really like 6,000 characters you need to keep track of and with this person's plotline is",0.10542093
it's really a story about Shai Rome,0.05800367
so you only really see things through Sharon's perspectives sometimes you'll get a little glimpse of somebody else's perspective but for the most part you only see through Shiro is not much dialogue in here,0.077996895
so the actors really got a focus on facial expressions and body language which I'll talk about the actors later,0.14933664
but oh they just do it,0.0483352
so well they tell so much things,0.060165815
this movie does a great job of showing and not telling you know usually if you hear like a story or you watch a movie the critique is don't tell your audience everything make sure you can show it by somebody's actions their facial expressions you know things going on in the background so that way you're not making your audience feel stupid by telling them everything,0.6358045
that's going on another thing,0.057631552
I really love about this movie is you get a slight sense of what it's like growing up in the hood,0.1393672
because like I said this takes place in Miami it's a poor neighborhood,0.31000346
so you see what it's like when there's in your neighborhood you can see what it's like when you know your parents are working in some of them just don't pay attention to you and you kind of see what it's like for the kids who are going you know going through this and and how they interact with each other also since you're getting kind of a glimpse of what it's like to live in a poor neighborhood,0.11226639
they don't focus and rely on stereotypes which I love because it's it's refreshing where it's like,0.04547467
it's a story about a young black man growing up in the hood,0.37593204
and there's no you know real obvious stereotypes the topics that this covers are similar to kind of the stereotypes but they do it in a way where it's more realistic,0.059052512
and less you know exaggerated,0.24214599
I told you there's drugs that are kind of mentioned in this movie,0.21485625
but the way they talk about drugs is never like glamorized,0.21093419
this doesn't seem like,0.08809292
oh I want to be a drug dealer one day like no glamorizing the subject no one's extra aggressive for no reason like there's lots of good cases of it just being you know like oh this is just there,0.17544806
this would really do a great job of depicting do different ways that closeted a gay man might act in a poorer neighborhood especially a poor black neighborhood,0.6413091
I'll give you a slight spoiler,0.10661726
but there's a character named Kevin and he's of there closeted gay Mian in the movie now both of them act in certain ways definitely based on personality and definitely based on the fact that they are both closeted both of them are you know closeted gay men but both are acting in a different way to make sure they're still you know being closeted Sharon's just consoling,0.40316334
he if you say he's gay,0.76907223
he's like just doesn't make any comment on it or he'll just be like no,0.1374241
and you know don't try to prove,0.08934665
nothing,0.074627765
Kevin I love the hand he's trying to prove that,0.077984445
he's an I gave and trying to beat,0.31089434
you to even having the assumption that he could be gay,0.78436583
oh they're very valid ways that someone can can act in those environments,0.18229906
so for them to showcase both of them is so great to me me,0.14116332
usually when you see coming of the LGBT community that's black usually they kind of fall into the extremes at least what usually ends up happening in entertainment,0.44446653
so usually they're either very very feminine or very very masculine both are very you know valid ways that people live,0.20490834
but the media always tends to do the extremes now Kevin and shyrone to me for more in the middle cash our own,0.08134138
these Falls more towards the feminine side,0.3445186
because of the stereotypes that people associate with being feminine,0.2575972
so you kind of fits in its light like a little little nudge,0.18426868
but not you know not obviously to the extreme Kevin's masculine in stereotypical terms of being masculine,0.10432216
but you know not all the way at the end of the spectrum because he's not looking for a fight,0.13472822
he's not beating up,0.17340393
somebody,0.093898244
every five seconds,0.1011013
he's not only ever talking about girls,0.350119
if it's more I want to say like more in the middle,0.11518851
but you know still still a little masculine which you know obviously,0.14887819
it's especially lost,0.15211326
all members of the spectrum are it completely valued by for the media for our film to show to people who are kind of you know in the middle on lunch maybe on one side or another is so great because it allows young black gay men and you know anybody else to be like okay,0.45842326
there's more than just obviously the extremes there's people in the middle,0.1043682
there's people who maybe not on one side listening spectrums or spectrums because people can fly all over they want to me,0.087814115
it's so important that the media showcases both of them or just kind of chilling,0.13146544
now let's talk about the filmmaking of this movie disclaimer,0.081605434
I am NOT a film critic,0.11165089
I really just recently just got into kind of focusing on a film,0.11352716
but the parts of it some rather than just looking at the movie as a whole,0.053230897
I really just kind of started looking at what is the soundtrack China saying,0.067522705
what is the lighting trying to say,0.081374496
and what are they trying to say by zooming in or the wide shot saying in the plot and all those kind of thing I just only just started so pick it as someone who's just kind of getting more into movies because I used to just be a casual movie watcher,0.14872296
now I'm really kind of focusing on,0.10713368
you know what's going on in the movie moon lights filming with Beijing's directing and everybody else of part of the film crew who you know had some input in it,0.07521168
I think they just did such a good job,0.0719421
now like I said it's just my opinion,0.07038852
but my opinion is backed up by critics,0.10743526
because if you're gonna write in Tomatoes more Lighting's definitely saying that like a ninety-eight ninety-nine percent which is obviously really good,0.10826462
and then if you look at the Oscars from 2016 you can see that they won best picture which is one of the most prestigious,0.046046216
awards you can get during the award seasons,0.056540675
and at the Oscars there's a won an Oscar for Best Screenplay adaption,0.039059177
and then I believe Marshall I won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor I think regardless pretty sure they also got a Golden Globe like I read like the talk during an awards season,0.09302658
so I mean I'm saying it's good,0.08009265
but you also have prestigious,0.07460418
you know boozy filmmakers who are also agreeing with my opinion,0.17667209
even though they won there two or three Oscars,0.050951164
I still think Barry Jenkins probably should have got like a Best Director Oscar because he did such a fantastic job,0.06523436
I mean like in the movie I feel like each scene has a purpose which sounds stupid because you know it's a movie all the scenes should have a purpose in the end,0.53665185
but nowadays most movies be having scenes for who knows what reason just to have the scene if you think about a movie in your life,0.16783312
well they probably could have cut out,0.108064294
this scene,0.10741917
there's no scene in this movie that they could cut out,0.093473345
that's how purposeful each scene,0.11359517
if this movie is because you take one part out and you're gonna be slightly lost like,0.13874494
and I just think I just think that's so impressive like,0.05949586
I said I'm not a film critic but so that might be the basis of all really good films but to me it's just,0.0847719
so impressive that each scene is so pivotal and so you know impactful,0.2407482
for the the message of the movie as I said previously this movie doesn't beat you over its head with the message of the movie and the theme however they do have some themes that you can pick up on let's reoccurring in the movie like I said,0.12254613
it's still not beating you over the head,0.50337
but you notice them if you paying attention,0.07326232
so one of the things is the color blue the color blue is mentioned and shown many a times in this movie as I told you the screenplay that the movie this is based off of is called in like black boys love blue,0.022846129
so obviously,0.083613865
they were gonna incorporate blue in there,0.060684305
but they did such a great job of just little hints of blue lights sometimes a character would be wearing the color blue,0.034544714
but you don't even notice cuz you just like well it's a shirt the walls will be blue,0.16750146
you know something that the background is blue all of these things that you don't fully you're just like,0.14611581
oh,0.046070345
well you know,0.060572684
it's just the color the way they implement it I was always trying to tell you something the same can be said for water water is also mentioned and shown in the movie I mean first of all they're living in Miami,0.11749571
so you're gonna see the water at the beach,0.09068239
because it's Miami,0.14710045
so there's the beach scenes that's kind of recurring in the movie and there's other little things that just kind of deal with water,0.046218034
that always mean something,0.073595
I won't obviously go into full detail with all the mentions of water and the color blue because I'm not trying to spoil the whole movie for you,0.05825765
but if you give it a watch pay attention to some of those things and you know actually self what is it trying to say what is it trying to invoke out of you,0.14509204
why do you think they put it there because I think it's fun to try to see what you interpret out of it,0.08958639
and if you do come back to this video and let me know or you know me personally hit me up and let me know along with the the lighting of the themes the sound design of this movie ooh sound design is also as impactful as the lighting in like the camera shots because this movie has little dialogue compared to like a normal movie,0.1504434
there's a good amount of scenes where people aren't talking where it's just kind of silent,0.16317782
and I know you're probably like Sabrina silence is not a part of sound design but it is good sound as I so really focuses on the silent moments of the film which moon,0.05894084
like does moonlight features some really silent bushings or like close to starting where you just hear like a little whisper of classical music the silence and sometimes some of the scenes is so important because you feel you know how shyrone is feeling in the moment you can tell just the way that the silence works with the film there's also some parts where the sound kind of gets distorted and those are the kind of things that kind of put you in the position of shyrone and you can kind of feel what he's feeling just based on,0.09054126
you know the weights some of the sound is distorted or it sounds like you're underwater or if you're at the beach how come kind of feel or or the loneliness and the silence you all kind of feel those as if you're shy room,0.15110989
I also would like to mention that the fact that this is a movie about a young black man in you know technically the hoodie soundtrack is not ramping with hip-hop,0.38242602
I'm not saying that's a problem,0.09113065
but it's refreshing they're always putting the association with hip-hop with you know being a young black man or just a black man in general honestly I mean I think there's maybe two sections where they have hip-hop playing,0.53490317
but for the most part it's silent,0.053610127
it's the sounds of the environment or there's like classical or old-school like doo-wop and R&B the way moonlight ends is something,0.11370912
I also really admire about this movie this movies sort of like a coming of age and usually but those kind of movies you know by the end of the movie all the problems that was in the movie is solved,0.07962654
everything's wrapped up in a nice little bow,0.16007967
you know that they're going into college,0.064143226
or you know that they find the love of their life or whatever you know all the issues with their parents are relatively solved for the time being,0.059562847
but the way this ends to me is so much more realistic I'll give you this analogy it ends where it's like you,0.1122199
and a friend are talking and talking about a story that happened in their life but instead of going and then you know we hug then everything was great they go and you know I don't know,0.058214303
we'll see what that's kind of how this movie and not everything needs to be fully told to you you can have some liberty of having some fun,0.081300415
and figuring out on your own,0.20179647
one thing I really wanted to make sure I mentioned about moonlight,0.075537205
it's the fact that this movie has an all black cast,0.42883304
did you hear me,0.071437754
I said all black cast and and I would say at minimum 80% of the cast is all dark-skinned people like can I get a hearty Amen,0.6699991
I say that because usually we're talking about a backup movie film TV show I guarantee you they're gonna focus on light-skinned or brown skinned people and though maybe have one maybe two four really lucky dark-skinned characters,0.43795294
but this movie this movie said not not a lot,0.08224625
we gonna have,0.056839593
mostly dark-skinned black people in our movie and I'm just oh but I will critique though is that the women in this film are not dark-skinned white I'm taking what I can I'm a big advocate for dark-skinned people in TV shows and film because we just don't be getting that kind of representation and I need that in my life when I say all black has yes I'm talking about the main characters that we're focusing on all of them are black,0.656664
why the director Bear Jenkins a black man,0.6364068
Tarell Alvin McCraney who wrote the original play black gay man I mean let's really dive into the importance of this all-black cast and the writers and director being black people because what did I say earlier none of this feels stereotypical they're not beating you over the head with stereotypical black thing,0.7426867
why because it's written by black people directed by black people so they know they know they lived it they know the experiences that will go on in real life,0.6395833
so what do they do they put real life into action,0.15349531
this is why,0.057506118
we need black people right,0.33994585
in black people before I started getting real high over the black cast,0.4922006
I really want to talk about the actors who play Kevin and shyrone as previously mentioned the movie covers three chapters of shower rooms like so obviously there's gonna be three different actors playing Shiro,0.116451725
and Kevin appears in all three of these chapters of Shaun's life so there's also gonna be three actors who play Kevin now the three actors who play shy rooms but those are all is played by two auntie Rhodes teenage Tyrone is played by Ashton Sanders and kitchen Aaron is played by Alex Herbert Charles the lead character all three of them really needed to be on their game,0.06677158
and all three of them absolutely delivered shyrone is not much of a speaker he doesn't talk much in this movie so a lot of the acting that goes into this movie is his body language and facial expressions,0.14879698
so for all three of these actors to exude the same energy and characteristics that shyrone would have is magnificent,0.17278348
with,0.024530113
Kevin we don't get as much time with him because obviously he's not the main character and not in his perspective,0.10962365
but I'm still not going to diminish their role because all three of them are still and tastic little kevin is played by actor named Jayden minor teenage,0.15615888
Kevin is played by jor-el Jerome an adult Kevin is played by Andre,0.072165996
Holland all of them are so charming because that's one of the main characteristics of Kevin at least to me is he's a very charming man,0.3634594
he's very likeable,0.15631743
though for all three of them to be charming in the same way at the various different ages is Jeff's case since I'm talking about Kevin and sharone,0.05128391
I want to talk about the way that this film depicts their relationship I say shyrone and Kevin's relationship is one of my favorite things about this movie because it plays right into what I really enjoy now as you're getting to watch more of my videos and hear about some of my opinions you'll learn that I love a good subtle flirting I enjoy the real your face flirting that's that's fun and all but I really love a good subtle flirtation where you mister viewer are like,0.23331824
oh what they just,0.06113468
are,0.030010587
they just flirting,0.07552986
like,0.02861636
oh they're trying to play it off as if they're not flirting but they're definitely flirting cuz you're looking at their eyes and you're looking at the way they're acting and you're like order definitely flirting,0.24970958
that's my Jo what's just was he looking at me like that,0.13243872
so now they're obviously not going to be outright flirting with each other because they're both at the end of the day closeted gay men so well I don't know about Kevin Kevin could be bisexual,0.6364068
it's the way the camera pans to Kevin's face or the way that the camera will kind of linger on a touch or position of one of the actors bodies towards the other,0.15490113
it's just Oh like I said this woman does a fantastic job of showing and not telling so it's showing you you're getting the vibes that they are flirting,0.22578697
it really it really sells the romance that's going on there,0.03757231
it really sells the romance of the movie usually with news about gay men are usually just,0.31334007
generally,0.040894043
the conception of the LGBT community is that it's really sexualized like media portrays it in such an overly sexual way that if you see a gay character on a show or in a movie it's always kind of based on the sex part of relationships,0.67116547
and not really the romance part this movie really focuses on the romance the intimacy of relationship is,0.048965547
so important with the way they kind of display the relationship that goes on I slightly spoiled that Kevin and shyrone engage in a sexual activity,0.6846526
I'm not gonna say what sexual activity watch the movie to find out,0.4974767
it's really you know press bonded but engaged in a sexual activity at some point in their life,0.5154597
and the way the movie portrays it,0.06405374
it's so focused on the intimacy of the act,0.14342779
instead of the lustfulness of the act,0.12412027
and I think that's one romantic and very cute in my eyes but it's also important for people to see and for you know young gay black men to see that not everything needs to be so lustful there's a lot of good in intimacy and showing the love of relationship rather than just kind of the lust it's so wonderful with the way that they chose to do it at this point,0.5576378
I've got on enough about moonlight and honestly I could go for more but that would require me spoiling some parts of the movie,0.15247577
and this would be like two hours long to some of this overview of I greatly enjoyed this movie I've seen about three times now and it's definitely something,0.12224268
I watch again and again later on in life,0.11159509
it's currently on Netflix if you want to give it a watch which hello you should have you not listen to my whole video go watching like more like to me is something,0.1870652
everybody can watch I told you I'm talking about it cuz it's Pride Month,0.085925765
