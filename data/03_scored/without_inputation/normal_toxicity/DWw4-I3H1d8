you will know how much of a fan I am of his in the last 6 years he has released,0.08664151
some of the best films which includes ansan DS enemy prisoners and Sicario,0.139473
I've actually reviewed on Sundays and Sicario you can check them out by clicking here,0.064477734
they are some of the best dramas,0.07753708
I have seen in recent years some of them touch on themes of war,0.15028363
you've also got a crime thriller in there,0.36132234
there's a psychological thriller if ever there was a director that I wanted to tackle the sci-fi genre it would be him,0.12333793
and my prayers have been answered with arrival,0.063179776
so this film is essentially about humanity's first contact with aliens who show up on earth in 12 pebble-like spaceships in random locations around the world,0.15174383
this obviously causes quite a stir around the world with everyone asking why are they here and are they hostile,0.24195038
so multiple governments around the world scramble to make contact with their each individual,0.09866015
ship,0.04601866
and we pick up with dr.,0.060893245
Louise Banks who is played by Amy Adams an expert linguist who is recruited by the American army to help decipher their language and communicate with them in terms of the plot that's all you're getting from me,0.09402671
I'm afraid,0.120099165
I do think that you will enjoy this film the less you know about it,0.23401831
but I have to echo what a lot of the critics and reviewers have already said you should not go into this film,0.12603652
expecting a big action alien,0.14154805
invasion war movie it's just not going for that demographic,0.2711645
if you are looking for that then you should go and watch the snooze fest that is Independence Day resurgence because this is a proper grown-up sci-fi drama with an emphasis on the drama and like all of the good sci-fi dramas before it this film isn't really about the aliens there the setting the emotional core of this film is the humans and it's all anchored by a terrific performance by Amy Adams,0.08765921
if you don't empathize or sympathize with her character's introduction then there's something wrong with you she is so good in this film you really go through the motions with her from the initial shock and awe of the aliens arriving to the pressure that mounts on her as she's got to decipher their language,0.13964969
she's got a real vulnerability,0.23315874
but a hidden strength,0.08459065
it's a terrific performance,0.13662247
she should be going up against herself in the Oscars this year for her performance,0.16961959
in nocturnal animals she's playing a different character but she's equally as good in this,0.1498762
she's also supported by a great cast which includes Forest Whitaker,0.15624674
as the general that recruits her she also meets with Jeremy Renner's physicist who's there to help her decipher their language,0.16305049
I know a lot of people have felt a bit if the about his character I think his performance is fine if there's any weaknesses there it's in the writing of the character I thought he was fine,0.07203159
I actually quite liked his character I would happily go for a beer with him but really the real stars of this film are Denis Villeneuve his direction,0.08522235
and the cinematography by Bradford Yan,0.05453506
I was initially bummed to find out that Roger Deakins wasn't gonna be the cinematographer for this,0.07019644
but it turns out I had nothing to worry about Bradford Young did an excellent job,0.085273676
it's a visually gorgeous film,0.061856862
and I also really liked the production design which is going for simple but very very effective in terms of the spaceships and the way that the aliens look I'm not going to spoil that but they're called hectare pods which might give you a clue as to what they look like,0.061633203
and I also have to mention the score and the sound design in terms of the score,0.039091915
it really reminded me of Star Trek a voyage home,0.061747424
when that spaceship arrives at earth and it's got that whale-like sound that's what the score is like in this but much more ominous and foreboding it's perfect and the aliens themselves have two forms of communication,0.10829937
they have an audible form which really reminded me of the Muto's from Godzilla,0.084992625
and they also have a written language which the plot revolves around,0.055621818
that's one that,0.055301577
the humans are trying to decipher,0.0649609
it's this ink like circles,0.08378504
I really liked the science behind it,0.08594638
I didn't understand any of it,0.07012118
but I really liked it,0.059911095
now in general I do like to try and give a balanced review and I do have a couple of gripes with this film which I think times with what a lot of other people have already said there were a couple of technical things like some of the CGI looked like CGI particularly some CGI hair which is very obvious,0.07810556
but it didn't ruin,0.10676505
my overall experience of the film and there are certain lines of dialogue which are said in certain situations which made it feel a little bit corny,0.31089434
and there are some pacing issues as well I do think that there is a big revelation which is wrapped up very quickly,0.06274762
I think the film would have benefited from being maybe 20 minutes longer which would have allowed them to sort out the pacing issues,0.03650832
but other than that it absolutely delivered,0.051937275
it was everything that I wanted it to be,0.06298908
so that's my thoughts on arrival and pause the video,0.14988844
if you want to take a closer look at my enjoyment record,0.08843055
now overall,0.059962686
I think arrival is a fantastic,0.075514965
thought-provoking sci-fi that absolutely deserves,0.10482205
its place amongst the best of them,0.07841124
and I sincerely mean that then evil nerve is a master of suspense and tension the first half an hour of this film is exhilarating,0.31089434
there was a moment when it's all building up to us first meeting the aliens when my heart rate was just thumping and my rate of breath increased in fact at one point it was in sync with one of the characters on the screen we were both like I will never forget that there's so much more to talk about I finally understand what all of the other reviewers mean when they say that there is so many layers to this film there's a lot of themes which it's touching on,0.06712784
I think it's touching on love and loss and communication interpretation science versus language and our understanding of all of that stuff and our understanding of each other can't we all just get along,0.08592992
there's also another underlying theme which I really want to talk about,0.06498908
but I can't because it forms part of the big revelation but I think what I'm gonna do is do a spoiler review I'm gonna go and see it again,0.057967223
and soak it all up and then over the weekend,0.052395225
I'll do a spoiler review for you because there's so much more to talk about in fact I'm gonna go right now,0.08363007
so like this video share the lave all that stuff and go into arrival,0.1538988
