well that broke my heart what is up flick fans and welcome back to my,0.024299825
channel today we are talking about one of my most anticipated movies of the last,0.026919981
couple of months it finally came to a theater near me we are talking the,0.041901913
farewell I need your comments down below did you enjoy this movie let's talk about,0.07861007
it so a Chinese family discovers their grandmother has only a short while left to,0.08227457
live and decide to keep her in the dark scheduling a wedding together before she,0.052138425
dies and oh my goodness a 24 one of my favorite Studios out there you,0.4399698
delivered an emotional gut punch a movie that handles atmosphere and tone I think better,0.14497079
than anything I have seen all year and one that broke me I said this,0.021262595
on Twitter I normally tweet out reviews right after I see the movie I had,0.033068273
to sit back and wait for about 30 minutes and just kind of ponder on,0.02640247
what I just watched not because there is a lot to soak in and think,0.030797338
about all what happened here and here the story is very simple it's all about,0.025719991
a family who comes together to basically celebrate their grandmother without telling her why they,0.054011583
are there to celebrate it's all covered up by this wedding and that really is,0.010435401
it's the premise of this movie it carries out until the end and like I,0.029995792
said this is just such an emotional experience if you have ever lost a loved,0.054408032
one if you have ever had a grandmother or grandfather in particular who was a,0.04208617
major part of your lives then maybe they begin to lose their memory or they,0.09666249
get cancer or something happens that normally happens to people that reach that age and,0.2174512
are maybe not in the best of health or maybe they are in the best,0.066512376
of health but they get to that point in their lives and your body it,0.06218004
just continues to wither down as you get older and when you hit that age,0.23058335
that's when hearts begin to break and things start to happen to your loved ones,0.03938885
and listen here's one of the reasons why I felt the way that I felt,0.050957724
about this movie I'll get into all of the brilliance of the filmmaking here in,0.11320428
just a second but just a personal story so my grandmother who I grew up,0.03057184
with and I saw basically every weekend of my life for 10 to 12 years,0.098957375
last year she was put in a nursing home because she had a health scare,0.10151368
she got dementia and she fell all those things kind of added up to the,0.20234554
fact that she had to leave her home go into that nursing home she's about,0.078934014
three hours away from me right now and it feels like every time I go,0.033367608
to see her I lose a bit more of her and my entire family feels,0.12776515
the same way and it comes down to the most recent time when we saw,0.03259799
her she had trouble recognizing me she had trouble recognizing my wife my dad calls,0.1922434
she doesn't know which brother it is it's just a very it's a complicated situation,0.059224624
and the entire time I was watching this movie I felt what awkwafina's character felt,0.054718006
in this situation it is a different situation from hers because in this movie she,0.04195247
has cancer and the cancer is so bad it's at a stage to where they,0.0908275
don't think they can really do anything about this and they decide to keep that,0.031219063
from her so she's all happy and giddy and just excited to see everyone her,0.14203002
her whole family is finally gathered back from America from here from there everyone is,0.07425977
here right and then you have Aquafina who is the one that is struggling the,0.026141718
most with not telling her what is actually wrong with her this is a Chinese,0.188686
tradition and one thing I loved about this movie is how it handled traditions traditions,0.028712653
from families in general gathering around the dinner table talking laughing joking around those things,0.027550576
you love doing when you go and you visit your family whether it's a brother,0.049215607
a sister a grandma a cousin whatever it is I have that with my family,0.113928
but they partook in all of those things and while that was going on you,0.044949118
see it kind of fluster in the back of everyone's head it starts out just,0.13237222
aquafina she's the only one that's kind of freaking out then it slowly transfers to,0.20347568
everyone else in the situation and to see that progress and to see even the,0.013982825
people who at the beginning of the movie were like we can't tell her no,0.04187464
matter what we do by the end of the film they're sitting back going I,0.019050194
don't know I it's a confliction that I saw progressing every single character and there,0.030855874
was not a bad performance I had no issue with the script when it came,0.015380376
to side characters dialogue from her parents to her actual grandma to her grandma sister,0.066885546
to her uncle's to her aunts the conversations every thing it led towards developing each,0.07878502
and every character and even the characters who maybe I didn't know their name you,0.009012573
could still see the emotion within them especially when everything comes to the head at,0.031134585
the end of the movie the eventual wedding not spoiling anything because it's in the,0.058504898
trailer but yeah it's just a story that I think is going to rock a,0.01977724
lot of people to their core especially if you can relate to it in some,0.022951497
way and it doesn't have to be a grandparent it can really be anyone in,0.037347402
your family or a friend you can connect with this situation now let's get into,0.025495823
the filmmaking because that's the reason listen if all of that stuff that I just,0.039168008
talked about worked really well I would say yeah I like this movie a lot,0.06272416
I enjoyed it but you pair that with this filmmaking the cinematography it felt like,0.06148625
every shot had a purpose everything was laid out so well and I know there's,0.11052957
a lot of hype around the farewell and I it's got a nine and an,0.033108186
around tomatoes it's gonna be eight listen I kind of bought the hype I'm like,0.034856953
yeah this could be really good I didn't expect it to hit me I didn't,0.046134476
anticipate getting emotional in the theater and I did I got emotional I sat back,0.016587684
at the end and watched every ounce of credits without saying a word moving touching,0.028441923
my phone anything I just sat and soaked it all in because it was such,0.047871936
an emotional experience and Aquafina everyone in this movie is good they carry their weight,0.035111055
they bring in the emotion and it's so funny because all this movie is it's,0.03971612
just a lot of conversation it's a lot of learning about this family and the,0.015021842
struggle that they have with each other the struggle that they have with decisions that,0.025528418
they made in the past and the struggle that they have with this particular decision,0.015551329
that's all the movie is so if you're expecting action or adventure or something crazy,0.06282394
or Aquafina to jump off of a building you're not gonna get that the farewell,0.19639947
is exactly what you think it's going to be it's just executed in the best,0.34007505
way possible and back to Aquafina who is magnificent I mean right now possibly one,0.06463124
of my favorite performances of the year she is broken when she needs to be,0.03381461
broken she is incredibly incredibly emotional on a level that I didn't anticipate I know,0.15163793
she's funny she's done funny before and she's done it well this is something else,0.08442245
this is something that I didn't think I would see out of her she is,0.06708244
magnificent and that mixed with this script mixed with the direct by lulu Wang who,0.095262945
first time making a movie hopefully this is not the last time I hope you,0.08789404
get every opportunity from here on out a wonderful job incredibly slick direction awesome cinematography,0.10214161
with the score and the score was just haunting in a sense and when they,0.04243273
took away the score from certain scenes and you just sit there in silence and,0.09570529
wonder with the characters what is going to happen next it just felt so real,0.016306313
it kind of felt like at times watching a documentary of a family that's experiencing,0.05668695
a trouble like this and because of all of those things coming together mixed with,0.089108
the a24 package so you know it's going to be an artistic film and yes,0.024565898
it is a bit artistic but I do think this is an artistic film that,0.070067786
is family-friendly it's only PG but it's family-friendly and heartbreaking and emotional and it is,0.015794786
a crowd-pleaser all of these thing I mean how rare is it that you get,0.07844444
a movie this crowd-pleasing yet its artistic and wonderfully made and the farewell for me,0.052134432
is just it's a great move it is a great movie one of the best,0.028560326
movies I have seen all year and one of my absolute favorites I have to,0.010966883
go you know what I was planning on going somewhere with my score I'm going,0.06223458
even higher I'm going 96% for the farewell one of the highest scores I have,0.015903875
given all year I place it on my list I'm actually gonna move it up,0.04490655
a bit higher because I the more I think about this movie more I get,0.08431735
emotional the more that I absolutely love it I feel the same way I felt,0.054787185
about eighth grade last year a 24 movie I walked out of that film feeling,0.02836476
emotional happy entranced this movie wasn't feeling as happy but it does end on a,0.05797142
note that makes you smile sit back and go I need to call my grandmother,0.14719383
and tell her that I love her or just a family member in general so,0.04460921
