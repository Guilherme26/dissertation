oh no Martin Scorsese film all right,0.101040564
we're finally here without a word by been booming said ello Rubicon,0.11554478
that's right was insane here,0.2412225
and we are here for another Bowman review for finally a new Martin Scorsese film the Irishman which is on Netflix not that you can actually go stream which is a three-hour,0.100685135
and plus epic which of course stars none other than Robert DeNiro John pesky and Al Pacino or cappuccino whatever a jack-and-jill but mostly focusing on the story of these men here from Frank Jimmy and Russel Frank of course who just won from you know Dublin truck scene they're just doing simple jobs,0.15036581
that aren't working for the mobster and working on the Russell and we get to see through the life a perspective of him,0.31089434
tours commentary alongside these gentlemen in this very long epic film here the irishman martin scorsese one of the most legendary iconic filmmakers we have of our error not the guy that you've been hearing Trent for months about his comments of MCU films a man that has established himself as one of the most innovative and most assertive directors in the style of form of what he has brought behind,0.1521041
the genre of just suspense of either his dark comedy of flushes at times but mostly films like this upon his mops in themes of such a if you compare it to Goodfellas which this film is inevitable to compare and I can truly say that as far as foams like this and it's kind of a great highlight moment for Netflix to kind of get someone of a caliber of what Scorsese as what was having this first time of this trio of robber and Joe coming out of retirement and Al Pacino on the phone together because obviously the last time we had a such of Robert and Al Pacino collab right just killer,0.27526897
I wouldn't say it was one of the best of moments probably blood that we got this year but a long side award season and alongside,0.045258135
the fact that with a lot that comes into play with a film like this would easily be the biggest budget that Martinus at the helm as well as it obviously being the long epic that it is which passes endgame is the longest moment of 2019,0.067582324
it is understandable for those that don't really go on the weekly basis of us,0.078317985
you know certainly themselves to kind of in do the movie experience and sitting through it that maybe something like this could seem a bit long to them,0.12807438
and maybe you might have to separate this into such a series breakdown after breakdown,0.10983112
I'm just the people that I look from the perspective of how people can sit an entire day and stream a TV show or an entire season but they can't sit through just a 3-hour movie maybe that's just me you of course,0.06362779
I Robbie Robertson of course is the long collaborator for Martin Scorsese returning after decades of collaborating and it only makes sense that for him to come in this project,0.067629464
because really who is the helm this this long tail of of just mobsters and just being through the perspective of these gentlemen through thick and thin and through almost every single horrible moment here but obviously with a Scorsese film with the hype around it and with the cast around it,0.25365722
I mean it's a big film and it's a film that it will take all of its criticisms and all of its indulging opinions because it Scorsese can give it opinion just like all the rest of our movie goers,0.12264433
why not for his own film right which is fine for me because it's not like in the sense that Scorsese is trying to redefine himself or anything,0.10564622
even though every film he establishes just,0.096382864
what makes him stands out was such of a character,0.09911583
but you know there really is such a traditional filmmaking here that really goes beyond a lot of the things that really kind of occupy when it comes to the storytelling and really a lot of the foreshadowing that Scorsese is very obsessed with you got a lot of the panning shots a lot of the visual images you have so much of kind of these creative spaces that really kind of set the environment and set the tone for a lot of the characters that Scorsese portrays a narrative cinema that really Martin the captures upon just the setting of New York,0.07535298
and obviously with the way that everything captures from every street angle from every side angle of people having a conversation inside of a club or having inside of a building or through a car,0.13913192
there's just so many translations through the weight of the camera base its itself and bounces from character to character that it's almost as if you know Martin is obsessed to make sure that you get every Satur perspective here especially that the interesting part of the dialogue engage here is that if those were reformed at all you know you look at characters that bounce off each other like one will be the messenger to another,0.077041
and it's just always so intriguing because it builds so much of the intensity because wow they try to flip you off of really trying to base it off just at any moment knowing that anything can happen with of course the dangers of the actions that are taking place here it's always from the perspective of the characters,0.06434303
and I think Martin is very not focused highly on trying to make you have to choose who you need to like or not it's more,0.08997135
so that these are the characters these are their vulnerabilities,0.06980285
and it's for you to kind of take it to the chin of this is really the setting of what it is,0.09822081
and not even just talking from the background but even from the sense of like the collar look and a lot of the things that very come tight upon just how Martin wants everything aligned with each other,0.077144526
there is so much gristle to detail that is just something that for him it's just as a visionary,0.08038717
you have to capture things quickly in your head than almost even the writers do and it's something that it all just occupies a lot behind the camera and there's just so much here that grandpa did so is this three hour film that everything just gets so much upon Martin's advantage from the budget to the way that this film takes so much of its time,0.13160555
yeah of course from behind the costume design Christopher Peterson as well as sandy Power who did work for the favorite and Mary Poppins returns and they do,0.05262051
and glorious job here with the design here,0.05469032
I mean Lord talking from the pantsuits the dessous jackets to the highlighting of the clothing here,0.09458937
I mean everything is so non high-profile it's not too too flashy,0.11478541
but it's just nothing the crisp of making the characters just feel very real upon their presentation like there are even moments that they play with the humor,0.061000932
in this film of you know a character walking in with a Gucci fit,0.14961866
there's someone just coming in with a suit that it's very transformative to an argument that it displays,0.16752759
so well from just the way that they can make everything,0.057247862
speak,0.043171473
in language that it's a tremendous job here,0.07915312
and also from going back to the score of Robbie Robertson's idea of really the score here not being again to too traditional,0.13603841
but there's ways that he use a lot of the acoustic form and a lot of the trembling ways to the score that really kind of sneaks up on that it builds this very crisp tone that doesn't feel very overblown,0.062407095
it doesn't put overdramatic for a film that is a drama,0.15858798
it really kind of sets home melodies here they are just very touching upon the way that it just grabs so much of the moments that it doesn't overpower a lot of other people in the room other voices it's like it just hollows in as if like everything is moving in slow motion,0.15249436
and it's just something that is just really capturing it just really shows why the chemistry between him and Martin is just so dynamic when they do films together now obviously with this being a film this long and obviously needing your characters to carry,0.061483588
the acting is obviously the very big front center of this film here,0.12906773
and with such including myself that a duty years been critical for such a Robert in the not Pacino films like this really kind of showed that man when they focus up it really kind of shows for the better because while Robertson the order this might not be one of my favorite performances from him and he's pretty solid in the film and Joe pesky of course who is not as very animated,0.08711
as he usually is you know he's someone that is,0.0505721
very,0.024965765
you know,0.07163658
he's very constructive on his very humid and very fast pace of speaking it's something,0.101197675
he was really great and good fellows it's really out Pacino that shines here and he shines in a way that is just an advantage of of what he does,0.10947167
so bets is that not only in the sense of being eminent and animated but he just finds ways to take the situation and a bunch of men in the room and he can extend one little piece of dialogue and make it just feel just so brutal but just also makes it hit in such a douchey way that it just gives the character so much to see him as like a friend that you can probably relate to in real life of someone that you just cannot control,0.07879938
it doesn't matter how much you advise this man,0.25615752
he is just so relentless and opportun I was so relentless in this film that you're just like,0.24083205
what are you doing,0.07937409
it's so dangerous,0.1727608
but it's so addicting and it goes a lot of credit to even the way that he'll even cut himself off like he wants to finish,0.27162722
the sentence,0.031634174
but he's so pissed that he can't get it out,0.5149831
and this was very performative to kind of the method of what he does with his acting that,0.10787685
it's really you know constructive here,0.08212253
and it does a lot to really kind of bring in the emotion of the scene even at the aging factor of how we can get props so it's not as addictive,0.069332644
as you would fear to be meaning that it's too distracting dark moments that the center part of where the camera angle is very close up that you can tell that robber has this thing looked at how we kind of holds its form,0.17536525
he's very good at it,0.092450485
it's what he's always been good at with the meat the films,0.18355256
I do think there are moments with his eye touches that they could have fixed that a bit it's a bit too much as like a robot look but other than that I do think for a moment for the most part,0.10277187
they did a really good job kind of capturing it obviously maybe not for makeup deform in a sense maybe so but obviously well whatever they had to use to kind of make that technology work,0.08043404
I think over the plate in their favor,0.11079352
and obviously this being based on the book,0.078878544
I heard you paint houses and weather patches of this could be true or not because these films being as long as it is,0.105211854
there's not a lot that they could capture realistically and those debates about that for sure maybe some reviews that you could be arguable or not in the sense of how realistic that the kind of capture the film I think mostly Martin kind of focus again on the detail of really kind of the delicacy of the emotions of seeing these men and seeing how the bond kind of gets created and how decisions have to get made whether you agree or disagree,0.0750499
because a lot of the forward-thinking here goes up on play of the way things get constructed or set up or,0.05989684
the reasoning of why certain moves have to get made,0.07813248
you know there are so much upon,0.076701894
the blocks and a lot of the set pieces that really kind of play upon the violence atmosphere as well but I think Martin kind of showed it from the angle of what how he sees it that it happens,0.09676245
so bluntly it happened so quick it's not glorified,0.07821958
it's not anything to be pretty,0.15235215
it's just really brutal,0.29326114
and I think this film is a very you know very dark and very cold feel to it that I think really kind of leaves it to stir and then you can't think about it too long,0.08800621
because then things are just moving forward because what the themes here of films that Martin is done before the doesn't come very far away from territory such as fighting a family of loyalty or respect there's a lot of the grounds of what the gentlemen in this film here come upon front and center of matter that people approach each other as men like the way people talk to each other in this film,0.09742341
they wanted front and center they do not want to be in the background like even though it may seem egotistical at times I think these characters understand that there's a lot more that bears upon what's to come to lose that for them,0.19362105
it's like if you're gonna address me address me,0.24522638
and that's what also comes with the character of a Frank where I think you see it from his perspective,0.057886016
because everything that comes upon a sense of none of this lifestyle to be hydrolyzed is that the floatie of his character is the fact that his own ego comes from whether he has the respect of someone else of migration,0.15425202
there's other people that you don't admire as well from their vulnerability of his constant actions that I think really kind of tours apart kind of the subtleties of really kind of his language speaking from his daughters to the way that residents for the love of his wife that you see from the love of his brothers that it comes so much impact to the way that people really want to sit and tell you how these moments should have been like this,0.11686882
but I think Martin kind of understands that not everybody can kind of approach,0.10143901
it the same family is not always bright and smiley a lot of things come really not even in a sense of bitterness and kind of you know distress it you know there are people that you trust,0.102132544
and there's just people that you know have a genuine feel to what they're approaching you,0.057281222
with yes that just kind of wanted like much into your life that you don't really want that,0.2715563
and I do like the idea of the way that the kids and really kind of the daughters are viewed in this film bed,0.15918109
it's leveled in the sense that they're not in the background just to be in the background they have human hearts too and sometimes they give that look that,0.15134676
but sometimes if directors can do it very lightly,0.047617633
they just really show a way that really it can kind of bring you in,0.049967792
and are you just,0.09850547
seeing these two people facing each other,0.15087217
and you can't turn away no matter how much Frank thinks that he's owing this family and is giving them a lifestyle that they can avoid there's nothing to avoid because they are a part of this this is something that they have to live with and they can't just move like regular people or defend themselves knowing that someone like this wants to be attached to everybody it's very threatening and it's something that I think really kind of humanizes the characters in a way that Martin really does very poetically even the comedy in this film the way that things are depicted that really for something,0.07530808
I find it,0.054207396
you know hilarious I find it in a dark sense you could look at the search of like the corner,0.1625496
store scene where Robert is coming in full like aggression mode,0.10864497
or you look at even the moment,0.099351786
when of course the Jo scene involving ice cream,0.06725729
they may feel improper even the moment as well where we have guys discussing the smell of fish like,0.17243244
I don't know how a scene involving the mentioning of fish could be so hilarious but it is if for me gripes with the film and it's not even really involving the pace or even like the length of the film I think for me,0.06260157
it always comes from the grasp of moments where I think obviously this is a very perspective film and there's a lot that you have to take in what some times gonna be a bit too much,0.107294165
and I do think it's understandable because that's really for anyone to kind of interpret upon that with your interest of these characters,0.10000958
but I do think there's a lot more moments that while we settle with these main main characters,0.07190284
there's a lot other characters that I wish that could have got a lot more shine that could have gave a real sense of like everybody being part of the experience,0.061207056
you know while you get these set of conversations,0.14107542
I think besides Frank given the comments or it would have been really nice to kind of give others that sounded the perspective as well,0.07074731
there's also moments where I do think,0.05248706
sometimes this film it definitely feels very big,0.091649674
and I think for its own good Wow it definitely has a lot to really kind of play with with obviously the rector that's so great at what he does I do,0.17000219
think,0.055016134
there are moments,0.05470567
I kind of wish this film could really took its own time,0.09228658
and in the sense of that with it being so fast because it's around for film,0.08717219
you already have enough to spare upon your runtime,0.31936386
and I wish it kind of took a lot more moments to really kind of breathe in emotionally because sometimes it does kind of feel like without the violent moments without a lot of the bitter and more very more petty moments,0.15253633
with a lot of the conversations that in dude,0.06539938
I think you motion 'le this phone could have definitely had its own moments to really kind of spew in and not feel cliche because morons never really been about the cliche but I think it would have been nice to kind of see the people that factored in this life very heavily to kind of get their own moments as well because I do think wow the Irishman does feel like a very big epic film and really kind of showcases a lot of what makes Martin the best of what he does with this genre,0.6080908
I do think that our moments that it takes me out,0.09723034
because sometimes I do feel like the film is running too long in one perspective that it just doesn't hit and resonate as much as visually,0.06372948
what's captured because visually,0.06127617
there's a lot that really stands out upon the storytelling,0.06826041
but I think verbally as you kind of get used to it too much that it does kind of feel like a parent that's kind of speaking to you repeatedly,0.20177718
I also will say as well that even though the ending the closing shot is great,0.31089434
I definitely think it kind of sinks in a lot of from the perspective of Frank I do think that ending takes a bit too long upon reach it really stretches out for about a 15 20 minute stretch and even though again I have no problem with the runtime,0.064882115
I do think kind of the pace is where for me it kind of really kind of triggers but I think overall the irishman is still enjoyable,0.24016921
it may not be one of my favorites from Scorsese,0.10800281
but I do think it is an experience especially for a Netflix film,0.103316545
it offers a lot the performances are pretty solid,0.0339123
but I definitely think Al Pacino was a huge standout here also wouldn't give a shot at the Bobby Cannavale,0.1859992
and of course there's a Clements who appear in here it was great to see them and also special appearance from that rapper that was great overall,0.08916704
the Irishman is on Netflix it's three hours and 20-some minutes I would say give it a shot,0.27909845
if you're a movie goer because it's more on Scorsese alone and whether you like it,0.170243
or not I still respect,0.0891311
the fact that he's one of the bolder filmmakers,0.112011276
we still have and for a man,0.1265592
that is that the pace of where he's at in life,0.088805236
he is truly making the films he wants to make,0.13699666
and I give that credit to him at Quentin Tarantino that they are truly showing that they can go by their own pace,0.09762227
and that's something you have to respect,0.06945669
and I I definitely respect them for that direction here I'm still good for them,0.060332753
uh yeah I'm out of breath whoo writing something,0.31089434
but the montre tomato saying the Irishman for me gives basic seven to the Irishman what were your thoughts under there's a comma box below we can with this kind of thoughts,0.15059482
