we so here we go with the positive so my pontiff's with the film our,0.092013106
first being I do think the acting for the most part is really good in,0.06299352
this movie Elsie Fisher is definitely I think the best element of this entire film,0.14988597
in my opinion I really do think she gives a really great performance as Kayla,0.10537217
she's fantastic she gives a lot of you know emotion and a lot of you,0.17291161
know a lot of quirks that you would see in you know a kid like,0.18515112
this around this time you know I mean because that's what I think I really,0.095668845
liked about this movie too is that it's kind of really relatable because I think,0.08778603
anybody can kind of relate to being like a shy kind of almost awkward teenager,0.18846682
around this time and you know I will admit I was very much like that,0.10379425
hell I can still be like that sometimes to be honest just for you kind,0.4030936
of be a little bit awkward than just you know not knowing what to say,0.24174663
and stuff like that sometimes I found the labra relatability in that I think Elsie,0.06829393
Fisher Wooley bling brings that very well into this I do think she gives a,0.077451825
really great performance in this movie and you know definitely one of my favorites of,0.06522486
the year for sure she is fantastic in this and definitely probably my favorite element,0.05326643
of the entire film Josh Hamilton is also great in this movie he plays Kayla's,0.051291082
a father and he was great too like my favorite scene in this entire movie,0.0671315
is like a personal conversation between the two of them it's really fantastic like really,0.09949201
how Josh Hamilton you know kind of gives his performance in that team that's fantastic,0.094492145
I really loved you know um oh you know I'm kind of tried to be,0.08120739
the cool you know kind of quirky dad and you know Kayla's kind of not,0.13741535
like you know please stop but I actually like that you know I mean I,0.26106912
thought it made it well with each other I thought they actually had some good,0.063145325
chemistry with each other like I like their back and forth whenever they would interact,0.11748297
with each other like I thought Elsie Fisher and Josh Hamilton actually had some really,0.050118677
great chemistry with each other you know like whenever they had seamed together I was,0.15779226
actually really great to be honest because the two just had some great chemistry with,0.07873328
each other so yeah Josh Hamilton I thought was really fantastic in the movie and,0.16991967
I would say most of the rest of the acting is very good here -,0.12877278
you know the movie does have some really good acting here you know I do,0.08044606
think of the most part everyone does their job very well um no I like,0.06698332
this kind of just this character study of like like I said before this teenager,0.12497647
going through the last week of eighth grade you know going into high school cuz,0.1392351
you know and can kind of be a bit scary you know I mean because,0.19957972
it's high school you know big big deal whatever you know I mean so it,0.15462627
kind of puts a lot of pressure on Kayla and you do see that in,0.085009575
the film I do like that a lot and you know like I said gives,0.07032648
a lot of great length ability cuz I'm pretty sure everyone can kind of relate,0.075387664
to this and really can you feel this and I do think the movie does,0.07068659
a very good job of that I like how it presents itself with that in,0.07462971
the film I thought they did a very nice job of that in this movie,0.07195771
and yeah I thought they did a really good job with it on the soundtrack,0.109603524
is really good to hear I thought the soundtrack was also really good in this,0.049587358
movie I quite like the soundtrack a lot definitely some of the best use of,0.044379834
music I've seen all year to be honest like I really liked the soundtrack a,0.06434548
lot here um the humor now it's not like a straight up comedy or anything,0.17991485
but there is some humor that is implemented into this movie it's the most part,0.05710752
I do think it's really really good especially one scene in particular that I'm now,0.068976134
go okay I'll just say her dad walks into onto something it's pretty funny to,0.23992194
be honest like I was literally like dying of laughter like I wrote I loved,0.15042773
you if I was really funny so yeah there are some times where the movie,0.10074154
does use some humor in the film I thought was very well handled to be,0.0583246
honest the writing is really great to hear I do think the movie has a,0.0858849
really great screenplay in my opinion I did like the screenplay a lot with this,0.06310003
film the directing is really good here too it's very well shot the editing is,0.13721348
also really good as well and the cinematography is very good here too like I,0.052732322
do think the cinematography is actually really nice in this movie so yeah I would,0.08970667
say the directing overall is very good here and I will say for the most,0.06267011
part the pacing is pretty solid I do think for the most part it does,0.049661797
move and a nice solid pace you know so yeah I did think the movie,0.054693136
did move at a nice solid pace for the most part now there are some,0.034747273
negatives I do have with this film and the negatives are first being I do,0.043984514
think some of the acting can be a little bit stiff that points are some,0.11359819
points where I do think the acting can be a little bit stiff especially from,0.13801104
this one character that's supposed to be the L the typical mean girl and you,0.25093806
know I thought her acting was kind of a bit stiff and I can go,0.36048406
for some of the other people at times during this movie as well and yeah,0.09935194
really I thought just some of the acting like I said for the most part,0.051380515
really the acting is very good here in this movie but there are some points,0.06735078
where I did think he kind of got a little bit stiff some of the,0.16182524
humor doesn't really work for me I know there's this one scene that involves a,0.05278952
banana that everyone's talking about and really thinks it's hilarious to me I thought that,0.24615242
was just kind of and like I thought that was just kind of very like,0.036060903
poorly executed in my opinion I just didn't think it was all that done well,0.23407741
to be honest like there are some points where the humor just didn't work for,0.06243877
me I thought I was kind of like okay and lastly my biggest issue with,0.15388505
this movie is that some of the pacing when it gets slow it gets like,0.09385549
really really slow there are some points where kind of drags it out a bit,0.10023273
in my opinion Mike except for the most problems very invested into the movie I,0.092825234
thought the pacing was really good but there are some moments where the would the,0.056869835
pacing kind got a little bit slow and you know it can drag out a,0.24192512
little bit for me so yeah that's all I really got to say in terms,0.12414487
of negatives with this movie overall I would say eighth grade is a very good,0.14786556
movie in my opinion I did quite like the film a lot there are some,0.0473956
really good elements that I did really liked about this film a lot to be,0.05762802
honest um and overall I would honestly recommend it to everybody I do think it's,0.085985675
a very solid film and I did quite enjoy a lot so it's time for,0.07208563
my first grade on eighth grade and my first grade on eighth grade is a,0.12217567
b-plus like I said very good movie I quite liked it a lot maybe I,0.11329975
didn't love it as much as maybe some people did but I am glad the,0.07502144
idea to enjoy it overall there are some really good elements to this like I,0.062267408
said Elsie Fisher and Josh Hamilton gives some really great performances just the way it,0.037821013
kind of explores how a teenager feels during like you know going into high school,0.08380555
and stuff like that it was very good overall honestly I really liked this movie,0.09293738
a lot it's a very solid film of my opinion another really good coming-of-age movie,0.088670865
will be getting a lot of good ones likely to be honest and this is,0.0507991
another one of those examples so yeah I quite liked a lot definite deserves a,0.08041395
