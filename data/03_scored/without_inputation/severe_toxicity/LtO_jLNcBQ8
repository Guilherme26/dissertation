welcome back to my channel today I'm reviewing the brand new Netflix movie Roma I,0.027158119
feel like I'm one of the last people on YouTube to review this because so,0.07026667
many people have seen it but it's finally on Netflix it's a movie that I,0.021715585
wanted to watch in theaters it's not in a theater near me yet but it,0.05886343
will be next week and I will absolutely be watching this again in a theater,0.029557435
but first we have to talk about it premiering on Netflix if you guys don't,0.03164212
know how my reviews work I like to talk about the good the bad and,0.0384536
then give you my score this is a non-spoiler review later on today I'm reviewing,0.049814273
the brand new episode of Titans I'm watching season 8 I believe of Voltron and,0.021627115
I have a review for the mule tomorrow is Aquaman but before we can get,0.040628754
into all of those things we are talking in Romo my goodness let's get into,0.06578467
this so Romo is a story that chronicles a year in the life of a,0.03354521
middle class family in Mexico City in the early 1970s now when I first watched,0.01860053
this trailer I didn't know that was the premise I didn't know this was something,0.02027147
that was based in more realism I thought it could be potentially this alternate world,0.0427753
with these wars that are going on in the background cuz I watched that first,0.08968405
trailer I'm like this could be trippy this could be like children of men the,0.23004152
other movie that Alfonso Kuran directed a movie that I just watched a few months,0.04558038
ago and my goodness does that thing still hold up it's a fantastic film he's,0.08084775
a fantastic director so I knew the directing and the technical aspects would be well,0.010226534
done and they weren't just well done I let's get into this this may be,0.04173961
one of the most beautiful and emotionally satisfying not satisfying in the way that you,0.13483272
think just from a visual and audible standpoint movie I have seen all year and,0.008480426
in a long time Romo is just a triumph in terms of filmmaking the way,0.031751875
that the camera follows these characters it puts you in the moment the way that,0.019076137
the camera pans from left to right right to let the unique style the shot,0.19334628
selection the use of wides I love a good wide shot especially when we're talking,0.25371215
about action scenes this is not the film for that but what roma does is,0.020266151
it uses these wide shots and it doesn't necessarily focus on the character that we're,0.035345197
supposed to be looking for the film allows us to find that character it allows,0.0100509245
us to focus on first of all what we want to focus on but second,0.027355012
of all you slowly start to realize what the film wants you to look at,0.049217604
and I love how he does that scene after scene after scene and every single,0.031428598
time I'm looking at one of these scenes whether it's a wide shot or a,0.07890741
tracking shot or a pan I'm sitting there thinking this is just some of the,0.07444004
best cinematography that I've ever seen now I believe if this movie was in color,0.04173828
I don't know if it would have worked as well it would have been beautiful,0.05704349
it would have been a technical masterpiece that it is right now I just think,0.019312277
the use of black and white a very gray thoroughly color corrected black and white,0.008027436
a beautiful and that was an incredible artistic choice I love that he went for,0.019551078
that and it just allowed me to see even more beauty in these scenes than,0.049025364
I would have seen if it was corrected with actual color now I'll get into,0.052283436
the first hour in my negatives it's not necessarily a negative it's just the one,0.06337936
thing towards the film where I was like I don't know if I love this,0.025473207
I don't know if I see what people are talking about because so many people,0.049107183
are calling this movie a masterpiece and they're like oh my gosh Roma I saw,0.065676905
the trailer I was intrigued I couldn't wait to watch this film but throughout the,0.029248124
first hour I sat there thinking what is the point of all this I saw,0.04096467
the beauty in it and I saw the technological masterpiece that everyone's talking about but,0.029248124
I didn't really feel that connection that I was supposed to feel for some of,0.014478387
these characters and especially our lead here who is absolutely fantastic she should be nominated,0.05466346
for every award and even though I didn't get emotionally connected to her at the,0.031321503
beginning I slowly started to realize what the hype was all about and I hope,0.03177449
you guys feel the same way I hope you continue to get locked in throughout,0.33479327
the story and then by the last 3045 minutes you are completely hooked by the,0.031598218
emotional aspects and just the way that this story goes it's not predictable it takes,0.017433798
directions that you don't anticipate I expected certain really epic things to happen in this,0.037697952
movie and I did not get that I got a real story with real characters,0.01885064
a real family things going on in the background but the focus always remains on,0.018640442
our lead and Cleo was a beautiful character and I loved every aspect of her,0.04232763
story especially once you get into that last 30 minutes at the hour and 30,0.017755747
minute mark is really when the movie went full gut punch and I lost it,0.22423129
I absolutely lost it watching this film I'm sitting on my couch this is the,0.0588182
first time all year I've truly gotten emotional and maybe it's just that story element,0.014854216
I'm not going to spoil what it is maybe that just resonated with me I,0.059136156
won't spoil anything about it but because I have a lot of friends going through,0.036454726
that portion of their lives and to see that happen with this character that I,0.070654474
have had an hour and a half to just kind of sit there and grow,0.03566515
attached to and to see everything that she's went through that the families went through,0.028882274
that she's went through with the family and then that happens and you are left,0.038169567
with this emotional hole inside of your stomach and it's like I said the first,0.36207342
time I've sat there and truly had tears in my eyes all year and it,0.0644696
was just an incredible incredibly sad but an incredible filmgoing experience but it wasn't just,0.05635436
that it's the beginning even the first hour when I was like okay can we,0.03004834
pick it up just a little bit I was still sitting there just feeling something,0.041448925
this odd strange feeling that I've not felt in a long time I was getting,0.045314305
emotional over the film making not even the story not even where it was headed,0.032190233
just how beautifully made this film was was getting me emotional and then the gut,0.10016801
punch happens within the plot that got me emotional and then that final scene where,0.15146963
the family is on vacation that's all I'm going to say my goodness I mean,0.043059997
there's nothing I can say that can really put that experience into words you guys,0.026106462
just have to watch it and experience it for yourself and it all comes down,0.051661488
to how you feel about what's going on on screen when they're at the beach,0.0351064
towards the end I related to that because my family and I that's some of,0.017823596
the best memories that I have is me and my family walking on the beach,0.035791535
on our family vacations and you can just feel the water brush up against your,0.030339027
feet when you're walking on the beach you feel the heat of the Sun and,0.029200232
that captured that perfectly you could see the Sun radiating even though the films in,0.031865623
black and white you could feel it you could get attached to it you were,0.0591927
attached to the family at the time and all of that playing with what has,0.014623397
happened to me in my lifetime the back story if you will it was just,0.030700222
way too much for me personally but in the best way possible it really hit,0.1050458
me hard towards the end and Roma is just a spectacle in all aspects and,0.113955274
don't put words in my mouth I'm not saying the first hour is bad it's,0.0753979
not bad it's beautiful it's good and even the story is well done it's just,0.02997251
the pacing was a little slower than I anticipated I thought it would move a,0.037522346
bit faster especially with koron behind the lens but it clearly did its job getting,0.042538494
me invested in this character and then once that third act hits or even the,0.047428258
second half of the film that's when I really started to realize why people are,0.032184247
saying this movie is a masterpiece and I think I agree with them I think,0.049578797
Roma is an absolute masterpiece everything that happens is just so realistic there are even,0.031269617
mistakes that the characters make and Kuran just probably said you know what we're gonna,0.024983633
leave that in because it captures the moment it captures what would actually happen and,0.030600443
it made it so much better than it could have been then we have all,0.04537018
of the stuff happening in the background whether you're talking about the riots or the,0.036034327
war or even the family aspect those things come to a head and when they,0.26780602
do it's beautiful but the focus always remains on clay it's always told from her,0.028461877
point of view the camera just kind of sits back and watches this it becomes,0.044593245
detached from this reality and allows us to look in it feels like a documentary,0.03687911
at times because everyone while they're unknown actors we don't know any of these at,0.046064634
what you guys might but I didn't know any of these actors they're still so,0.020306727
good there are award-worthy this cast was incredible the kids were wonderful the emotion was,0.053947724
just constantly in your face but not in your face to where it was annoying,0.41705093
it was in your face because you can't help but to get emotional watching everyone,0.10176711
go through these tragedies and then the beauty inside of it and finding things to,0.04600144
make you happy at a time of either loss or sadness there are beautiful themes,0.040188402
within here so many layers to this movie that's why I said before I can,0.02290693
actually settle on whether or not it belongs in my top 10 top 5 top,0.034970034
3 I have to see the film again because while I do truly believe it's,0.01675132
the best made film of the year I don't necessarily know if it's my favorite,0.020406503
I don't know if it has that rewatch ability but regardless that takes nothing away,0.04494513
from how well-made I think the film is because once again I think this is,0.018803412
the most well-made movie of 2018 Netflix congratulations you did it and anyone who tells,0.03610484
me oh this is a Netflix movie they're not going to get nominated for an,0.027402906
Oscar because it's a film of string on the streaming platen if you think this,0.060892243
doesn't deserve to get nominated because it's on Netflix just get out you don't belong,0.07451786
in this industry you don't deserve to have a place in film criticism you don't,0.052406494
even belong on YouTube go home shave your head stick in the toilet and flush,0.3741277
it just keep flushing it until the water just keeps filling up and then you,0.053283207
remove your head and you're like wow it does deserve to get nominated for an,0.50764465
Oscar nothing I said made sense but I'm angry I've just been seeing people online,0.027325079
that are saying oh this doesn't deserve to get nominated because it's on Netflix to,0.040205695
piss off anyway let's talk about the negatives to Romo I really don't have very,0.42214113
many because the filmmaking was almost perfect from a technical aspect it's all just some,0.024745496
of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen the cinematography I'm a big cinematography guy,0.072425194
so I love all of that where are the negatives Austin get into the negatives,0.029192915
the only thing I have to say about this movie that really bothered me is,0.0464378
the first hour was very slow now I do usually complain about movies being slow,0.044521406
it's usually my big critique but I think the reason that it bothers me so,0.037078667
much right now is because I was so in love with the second hour of,0.042763326
the film and I was so in with these characters I just didn't feel that,0.022957483
way about the first half I still think it's beautiful I still think it's amazing,0.058284055
I just wanted to be a little bit more onboard and less Hospital and I,0.05041227
thought it was going to be and also I'll say this this does not apply,0.030821284
to me but for someone who is watching this movie that doesn't love like the,0.035161607
artsy fartsy aspects of a film they don't enjoy artistic elements and they're not really,0.11450005
into the super realistic style movies if you don't like following a family on a,0.03400419
journey if you're in it for say action or something that you think is going,0.03773188
to happen towards the end that's like oh my gosh it's the most mind-blowing moment,0.22323635
of 2018 I don't know if you're going to love Romo I don't know if,0.061106432
you're going to appreciate it as much as I do and that's okay you don't,0.06836225
have to appreciate it like I do you can have a completely different opinion for,0.011860889
me I then Roma did everything that I needed it to do and more it's,0.071322985
so bit of the fact that it's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen,0.05377544
in the last decade is an incredible incredible feat and that's one of the reasons,0.028390039
why I love it so much all of those things being said that one minor,0.039635632
critique is keeping Roma away from a perfect score for me and I did not,0.03369554
anticipate giving this movie this high of a score twenty five minutes into the movie,0.05746588
but when that thing was over and I was wiping the water out of my,0.08789138
I'm not afraid to tell you guys that listen I don't get super emotional during,0.06523323
movies a lot of the time I get emotional but I don't show it I,0.03159356
showed it this time I was sitting on my couch thankfully by myself just sitting,0.05319939
there with tears coming out of my eyes because it was so so beautiful Roma,0.1193386
is a feat it's monumental and that is why I'm going to give this movie,0.03082062
as close to perfect as I ever thought a 98% the highest score I've ever,0.03877289
given a movie on Netflix one of the highest scores I have given all year,0.014266859
Roma is absolutely incredible and while it may not be my favorite of the year,0.03339355
it's absolutely the best and most well-made movie of 2018 thank you guys so much,0.02776676
for watching this video thank you for watching my channel still have a lot coming,0.033954963
out later today I'm actually going to watch the mule right now here in about,0.09488645
ten minutes and then I have a video of Titan's coming out but tomorrow is,0.02816321
