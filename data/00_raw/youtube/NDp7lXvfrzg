[Music] either guys how are you so I feel like I'm the last person on the internet to see this movie Logan is the third standalone Wolverine movie does anyone remember that abomination against humanity you probably don't want to remember it because if you do it'll give you nightmares and some people like that movie and that's okay but I think it's a big bloated pile of [ __ ] and it almost ruined the entire franchise of overeating well we got this movie so it makes up for no with that said check out my awesome new Wolverine t-shirt these are located at mighty public store I'll put the link down below I have like nine new Wolverine t-shirts I picked up it just felt necessary and to be honest with you I actually couldn't decide which Wolverine t-shirt to wear for this movie review watch this old clip from 2013 where I kill x-men origins Wolverine and I'm going to go switch my t-shirt I'll be right back I think I like this one a little bit more alright so Logan is directed by James Mangold who also directed the second Wolverine movie titled the Wolverine and as far as that movie goes I don't think it's a bad movie it's slightly entertaining but it's just a very forgettable movie in the Wolverine franchise because by the third act of silver samurai turns into a Decepticon and [ __ ] you're just like what's happening now let's talk about the movie Logan this film is based on the old man Logan comics and it takes place in the near future where everything in this universe has went downhill and by the way just on a quick nerdy side note why can't they just give Wolverine his suit for one movie they almost did it in the last movie almost and it's like I get it you can't have Hugh Jackman running around and yellow spandex but and this will be Logan Wolverine is old he's grizzled he's beaten down he's tired he doesn't want to do this anymore because now when he gets shot or stabbed he doesn't heal instantaneously he's more vulnerable he can't really take a beating like he used to I mean he still has adamantium claws that can heal eventually but there's a larger sense of danger there when he's in these situations and it puts you on the edge of your seat a little bit more so yeah let me get this out of the way before we continue on if I was writing the script for this movie I would have made part of the script or maybe a plot point to where since he healing slower maybe he does have to get a suit of armor somehow some way to go into the final climax of the movie in that suit of armor might look something like this I don't know I just get Wolverine of yellow spandex I want it all right let's get back to the plot of the movie but by the way if you guys agree with me let me know down below in the comment section and as far as the overall vibe of this movie goes and has a very post-apocalyptic western vibe and I loved it I just love the way that this movie looked and the way that it felt with the scenery and the settings in this film had a very immersive vibe to it but now let's talk about Charles Xavier played by Patrick Stewart and in this film Charles Xavier is not doing too well he's suffering from a mental illness where it confuses him and sometimes when you combine that with his mutant powers where he uses his mind it's a disaster waiting to happen and that whole aspect plays a very large part in this movie and I really enjoyed that because everything is very unstable at times and there's a few really intense situations where Wolverine is the only guy who can step in and save the day now the best way I can describe Logan this is a comic book movie for people who don't like comic book movies now don't get me wrong I love comic book movies can you tell look at all that [ __ ] back there but more often than not comic book movies are over produced they're over budgeted they're over scripted they're just a big bloated CGI mess of just random explosions and [ __ ] just happening for the sake of happening this movie at times almost feels like an independent action movie with great character moments but it just so happens to feature the character of Wolverine and that's the biggest praise I can give this movie it feels like a real movie and not just a comic book movie I'll be honest with you going into this movie that was my fear because I almost thought it might be underwhelming and not quite give me that comic-book aspect of that epicness and those berserker attacks I was looking for but I am happy to say the Wolverine fanboy inside of me was very happy five minutes into this movie because you realize they are definitely utilizing that rated R rating and they're giving you the Wolverine we've all been waiting 17 years to see isn't crazy hugh jackman has been this character for 17 years and I think with Logan this is probably the best portrayal of the character we've seen yet and most importantly we get those hardcore rated or Berserker attack scenes we've all wanted to see that's right 78 people get decapitated in this [ __ ] movie with adamantium claws from a storytelling standpoint everything that happens in this movie with the action and the blood the guts from the gore and the violence it all blends together so well and in between all those things you have characters and you understand these characters so when they're in these intense situations you actually care about what's happening to them and out of all the x-men movies I would say this movie have some of the best character moments and there's a few very sad dramatic scenes between Charles Xavier and Logan to this movie and the chemistry between these two guys it's great now let's talk about the little badass who does berserker attacks in the movie and her character's name is Laura but this little girl was awesome she was well-written and there are scenes where she kicks a lot of ass and it gets like just a little girl dangling on wires of special effects helping her do these things and as far as movies go the best thing I could do to compare to her character in the movie Logan is she's almost like Hit Girl from the kick-ass movies she still does a lot of the scenes in the movie so yeah I really liked the character of Laura in this movie now with all that said I do have a few complaints with the movie now this we does have a few antagonists that go up against Wolverine because we'll really need somebody to fight and I thought for the most part as far as the storytelling standpoint goes they were sufficient they did their job but I also thought they were both very bland and one of the antagonists in this film almost feel like it was just tossed in there because hey we need another badass for Wolverine to fight so let's just do this now does that mean it's bad no I really enjoyed their final showdown in the movie I really thought it was well done and awesome to watch but I sort of wanted something else and one other thing I didn't necessarily love about this movie is during the third act of the movie the big climax is happening things are going down the action is ramping up I got to score that was backing all this up wasn't very good when it comes to musical film scores I think they can really intensify the action that happening up on the screen and during the third act of this movie or people or running around in the woods it almost felt discombobulating it just feel like random noises happening and it didn't really build up the situation as much as I wanted it to you take other movies like Batman Begins of the Dark Knight you hear that Hans Zimmer score and it builds up and it escalates the sequence and amazing scores like that almost give you a little goosebumps down your arm you guys know I'm talking about but during the third act of this movie that score that they play it just didn't really do anything for anything happening up on the screen I thought it almost took it down a notch so now here are my final [ __ ] thoughts on Logan first things first I think we got by saying Deadpool because it took a chance and it was one of the best rated our comic-book movies that made a lot of money because of the success of Deadpool Fox Studios said wow we can put our head down of our asses and actually make movies that go for and aren't watered down because as far as comic-book movies go there are just some stories that need to be rated R to give the viewing audience the best possible movie they can and once again I love Deadpool it's rated R it was awesome it was a blast to watch but when it comes to films movies like Logan evoke emotions out of me they made me feel something they make me feel sympathy or a feeling of sadness and other times when Wolverines getting beat to [ __ ] and he's down on his knees and he's about to give up that one little ounce of energy fire is up inside of him and his claws come out he kicks everyone's ass and I love moments like that so a movies that evoke emotion out of me are just my preference for movies and that right there is why I think Logan is probably the best rated our comic book movie ever made so I'm going to give logan hara a solid a this isn't a perfect movie it has flaws there was room for improvement but after watching the movie i wanted to watch it again and very a few movies do that for me the movie Logan definitely goes for it at times and I respect things like that so that's my take on the movie Logan guys now here's my question to you and let me know down below what you guys think about the movie Logan or what is your favorite rated or comic-book movie of all time
