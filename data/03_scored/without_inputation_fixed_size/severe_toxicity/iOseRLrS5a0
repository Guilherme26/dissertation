[Applause] everybody and welcome back to another movie night - movie review my name is,0.01823601
Dalton Burdette and today we're gonna be talking about nineteen fifty twos singing in the,0.038347837
rain this film stars Gene Kelly Donald O'Connor and the great Debbie Reynolds and this,0.030643681
film was also directed by Gene Kelly one of the main stars and Stanley Donen,0.0007186509
this is a movie musical one of the classic movie musicals but also the plot,0.026810892
of this movie also just kind of wraps its way into movie history which is,0.041958455
the period of time where movies transition from being silent films to movies with sound,0.02499361
or talkies as they were called so it takes place in the late 1920s and,0.01976194
it's sort of really about like this Hollywood stardom opening scene of this movie is,0.045171957
brilliant one of the great things about this movie is its excellent use of comedy,0.04774622
and comedic timing and the way that it uses its exposition and I really liked,0.020216262
how there's a scene in this movie where these two characters you know gene Kelly's,0.03814163
main character and one of the annoying co-leads who that actress was also nominated for,0.041447595
Best Supporting Actress in this movie because she's so funny in it her name was,0.058041263
a Jean Hagen in real life anyway they're being interviewed and the interview is asking,0.07414004
him like I'll tell us about your story in your humble beginnings and while he,0.030650333
says things about how he went to this prestigious you know school and how he,0.047218725
started off by doing dance classes here in acting classes here it's actually narration /,0.03161884
flashbacks of what really happened in his life and it's him starting from it's like,0.060896896
a rags to riches story but you've seen conflicting narration with what's actually happening to,0.02505015
kind of show it not only sets the tone for what the feel of the,0.03687379
movie is which is comedic it shows his actual backstory and it gives insight as,0.017167725
to how the you know Hollywood make a machine influences how you have to be,0.020838873
in your public persona so it does just all of those things in one scene,0.044663757
and it was such an awesome and interesting way to go about doing that and,0.027227297
also speaking more towards the cast like Gene Kelly Donner will collar are great but,0.015493457
like Debbie Reynolds just what a national treasure Debbie Reynolds is like you're nothing but,0.045356877
a shadow on film a shadow you're not flesh the musical numbers in this film,0.083658814
are excellent I think that it's not only just the quick choreography of the dance,0.046073943
and lyrics of the songs but also just the cinematography and direction of said musical,0.011849581
scenes are really well done almost better than the actual scene themselves was just how,0.017724484
the musical scene was filmed and while the film does have a lot of really,0.0033591774
well working comedy I think another great thing about this film is it's very deep,0.051930223
characters and how each each character sort of serves its own purpose to the story,0.011552244
but also is just a fundamentally different character you know gene Kelly's character is just,0.026512224
you know the main lead who is really tired of being taken over by the,0.036092866
Hollywood system you have to be Reynolds who's an up-and-comer who wants to get into,0.04818058
the Hollywood system and you have Donna O'Connor's character who is also a hugely funny,0.014737144
character whose role is to just be the best friend of Gene Kelly because they've,0.023759695
been best friends since they were growing up and just also you know always play,0.011549584
the piano be there and just kind of be that guy that is the you,0.052773673
know how about we do this you know that guy like that there's a role,0.027701573
in every friend group for that guy and this is what he does and I,0.055218223
know I keep you know being repetitive saying how well the comedy works in this,0.039067566
movie but this film is genuinely really funny and that's not something that gets talked,0.052405827
about very often when singing in the rain gets brought up since it's a musical,0.019940875
beavers talked about the music this film is hysterical but you have to in the,0.0604918
bush try it again she'll get it textured look cleaner don't worry we're all a,0.081691206
little nervous the first day everything's gonna be okay oh by the way Rosco you,0.07782782
know the scene coming up where I say imperious princess of the night I don't,0.054360136
like those lines there is it alright if I just say what I always do,0.020866811
I love you I love you I love you sure anyway it's comfortable but into,0.03330508
the bush okay again why but Dena we're missing every other word you've got to,0.022757929
talk into the mic all right all right and also just since I'm a sucker,0.32592547
for you know movies being about movies you know seeing the silent to talkie transition,0.016436689
happen and how Hollywood kind of freaks out and they take it more of a,0.2508804
comedic route with it but if that was just really fun to see portrayed in,0.027609112
a sort of fantastical musical style movie and you know the few scenes where you,0.0389332
get all three of them together especially when they're performing musical numbers it's just it's,0.031514406
pure cinematic magic it's wonderful as far for negatives about the film this film was,0.023585416
only like an hour and 43 minutes long but it does feel its length at,0.02785656
certain points or just means that there's an issue with the pacing and while it's,0.030028386
not a huge problem it is noticeable and this movie does kind of do things,0.034934115
for the sake of doing them and not necessarily for the benefit of this story,0.020196306
and look I understand the cinema of attractions I totally get it but like there's,0.03860327
a sequence where they have to rewrite one of their movies because it's just it,0.03932233
played horrible it was garbage and they're trying to figure out how to fix this,0.2603736
movie and Gene Kelly is like oh how about I pitched this musical number and,0.030243905
then it does the musical number that he's pitching to the producer and it's like,0.020565482
it's the biggest musical number in the movie it's long it's extravagant and it looks,0.027028408
beautiful and it was extremely well done like that's not the the point but but,0.03482436
like we were in such an integral part of the movie and then it just,0.01977857
like puts the plot aside and does this musical scene that is extremely long and,0.030780043
then it just cuts back to the producer and the producer is like ah yes,0.023504265
great idea and it's just like okay that that seemed just felt very misplaced to,0.040268887
me so I think just pacing and the you know very very small instances of,0.03495274
style over actual substance of what's going on can really hurt the movie but not,0.02747275
in a big way but it is noticeable and you know one more positive before,0.021638423
I end it as I'll say this movie is very thematic alia rich you know,0.106541134
the actual singing in the rain sequence it to a point where the lead character,0.012814763
is kind of having a rollercoaster of ups and downs throughout his career and you,0.04710764
know that scene really comes about to tell just the you know underlying story of,0.01260257
when you're dealt about hand when you have a bunch of horrible things happening around,0.102613226
you when it's raining outside just sing just make the best of what you have,0.030599779
and eventually you'll find happiness out of that and this movie does do a great,0.044093028
job of reiterating that story in an underlying manner where it's not too in-your-face and,0.06782479
I like subliminal stories like that so overall I love singing in the rain I,0.046576157
think it's a wonderful musical movie I think the numbers are great I think the,0.028336823
characters are great the actors are great however I do think it's pacing could be,0.028452566
better and there are some scenes that are just there to be there and not,0.019583007
necessarily serve to the story or the characters but this is still a fantastic movie,0.010047599
and I'm going to give singing in the rain in a thank you guys so,0.028755888
