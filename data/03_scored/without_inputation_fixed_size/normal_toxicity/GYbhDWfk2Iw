Miles Morales finally gets to take the lead as spider-man on the big screen in,0.15033813
an animated film like I've never seen before so let's talk about in the film,0.09880769
Miles Morales is bitten by a radioactive spider in gains incredible powers before he masters,0.092757456
his abilities he's thrust into an adventure to save all of reality from kingpins evil,0.31089434
schemes along the way he meets several people who have powers similar to his own,0.15438889
so I actually saw this one back on Saturday but as soon as I got,0.07846893
home from seeing it I was just wiped out sick for a couple of days,0.25922102
so I've been wanting to talk about this one and with that in mind go,0.12401389
ahead and join me down in the comments section if you've seen it what did,0.09709291
you think about it once you see that tell me what you thought about it,0.07683201
let's have a nice lively discussion with that said let's get started talking about the,0.05812348
good and the first thing that comes to mind with this movie is the look,0.0937888
I have never seen a movie that looks like this before and that's very much,0.09729934
a good thing they found a way to create this visual style that feels like,0.07337846
a comic book come to life whether you're talking about the low framerate the way,0.28939673
they framed the shots the way the characters are just animated and drawn all of,0.107706726
it looks like a comic book and then beyond that inside of the story there's,0.08562014
comic book page turns there's framing devices where it zooms in on a frame and,0.101895146
that goes to another shot there's elements where words appear on the screen so many,0.09832069
different things that I've just never seen something like this and so it's just a,0.06432917
real delight to see this movie except for kingpin I did not like the look,0.1216598
of kingpin we'll get to that and a little bit later but otherwise this is,0.10696867
a movie that is just so creatively drawn in a new way to animate a,0.07397966
film along those same lines the visual style meshes perfectly with the type of story,0.07649948
that they're telling it's very comic book II when they're incorporating spider-ham and spider noir,0.12445687
inside with Miles Morales and Peter Parker and to do that they picked a visual,0.061832704
style that allows you to suspend disbelief in this context in a way and just,0.110827014
go along with the story the combination of visual style and storytelling style create all,0.056667402
these new opportunities to create a unique experience that is probably the most comic book,0.09121364
II film I've ever seen another great thing about the film is the humor it,0.036612216
has a very sharp wit in a very diverse sense of humor a lot of,0.098175205
the humor comes from kind of poking fun a little bit at the Spider Man,0.14882585
movie franchise but other aspects kind of tie into the different individual characters so spider-ham,0.08190552
has big broad humor and then spider and war has this very dry self-serious sense,0.24150592
of humor but in general it's just a clever script where the setups the running,0.08223217
gags and then the callbacks they all pay off including a fantastic after credit sequence,0.103433125
but of course with ties it all together are the characters Myles burrows leads the,0.10629509
pack and it's fun to get to see this new spider-man take the lead and,0.16822709
how his family dynamics shift the way this character becomes a here and what that,0.061321862
looks like inside of his life perspective but all the side characters are given their,0.068467535
unique moment to shine the unique spot inside of the script no one's annoying in,0.07367342
a bunch of them like spider-ham spider noir Aunt May are all scene stealers my,0.3785168
personal favorite was Peter be Parker I went in a little bit skeptical from the,0.09756806
terms like what are they doing with Peter Parker but inside of the story they,0.053584885
explain where he's coming from certain choices that he's made that have brought him to,0.054354586
a specific place and they give him a really powerful arc that I thoroughly enjoyed,0.050414328
from beginning to end once I saw what they were doing with the character but,0.025697459
what really surprised me was how developed the villain set was kingpin is impressively threatening,0.1916832
as well as characterized for a PG movie what table to get away with ends,0.11878783
making him a dangerous villain where there's real stakes while keeping to a PG rating,0.2175517
is actually pretty impressive for the modern era beyond that his motives are clear we,0.06515507
know what he loves we know what he values we know what he will do,0.0602225
to get what he loves the other villains and the mix some of the side,0.13669962
villains also tie into the story in different ways that I don't want to go,0.08780691
into for spoiler reasons but all of it feels like a great set of villains,0.21832721
from there let's move on to the mixed aspects of this film and the big,0.047852457
thing that comes to mind here is that the film follows certain familiar formulas and,0.02445767
templates in regards to team-up movies as well as story arcs about a new hero,0.082516365
on an adventure with more experience here as you've seen some of these beats before,0.11221304
you can predict generally when certain things are going to happen in the mix and,0.08981662
it's obviously not a good thing I don't think it's a particularly bad thing because,0.10945941
the rest of the movie has a lot of creativity to it but if you're,0.25294837
someone that's very sensitive to kind of familiar beats and things like that it could,0.0637677
be a problem for you from there let's move on to the negative and the,0.1001921
big thing that comes to mind is the design of kingpin every time he showed,0.1042802
up on screen it was distracting for me because I just don't like the way,0.112115495
they drew him with how physically wide he is it just looks out of place,0.27266607
with the rest of the designs for me so I did not like it and,0.14877035
the other thing is that penny Parker seemed underdeveloped the other characters seemed to get,0.14592113
more of their moments to shine you got a little taste of who they were,0.23253562
a little bit more and she seemed like the one a little bit further in,0.21835321
the background and so she should have gotten a little bit more time on screen,0.10210425
that's it this is a very fun movie a very unique experience I have never,0.0799349
seen a movie like this before it's very cool that we live in a time,0.094737045
where a movie like this gets to exist before I give you my final scores,0.24583952
