you yeah girl you know were you alone in paris yes victor i was i,0.24048197
know how it is oh yeah she was lonely i thought he said were you,0.24231501
alone and i was like so that's why she said he was dead because she,0.4531263
really didn't think he was because he was in the concentration camp of course i'd,0.09667206
be careful so he's probably gonna die tonight is she gonna go see rick i,0.6207991
would talk about a late night booty call richard i had to see it was,0.2312132
richard again we're back in paris he is so sheisty i love it fighting for,0.14125809
anything anymore except myself i'm the only cause i'm interested in that's what heartbreak will,0.15117893
do to you girl you did that to him you knew what really happened if,0.1059612
you only knew the truth i wouldn't believe why don't you tell him she has,0.16236289
a gun i also didn't come to play all right i'll make it easier for,0.15473644
you she won't no she won't do that ah she's pretty even when she cries,0.5357897
uh can't relate and if you need proof go watch fried green tomatoes you knew,0.06391696
how much i loved you well tell him how much i still love you oh,0.07085169

she had a man but he was dead all except one he won't have you,0.40081754
oh they're back together oh i love this so i wonder if laszlo is gonna,0.17257383
get the the transit papers and then he's gonna leave elsa like and it just,0.06284658
all magically works out like that oh wait i forgot that laszlo doesn't know that,0.15110517
elsa's there if we stop breathing we'll die we stop fighting our enemies the world,0.54073274
will die good point it's perhaps a strange circumstance we both should be in love,0.27491602
with the same woman oh so he does know we use the letters to take,0.240397
her away from casablanca do you love her that much yes i love her that,0.1832782
much wow i didn't expect that from laszlo you're not very subtle but you are,0.31089434
effective i i get the point i respect that you get something really big something,0.09641375
that would chuck them in a concentration camp for years quite a feather in your,0.48229295
cap wouldn't it oh would you really do that to him though but you were,0.16755675
never interested in anyone she isn't just any woman i see he was in love,0.241326
with her before you don't know his story and by the way call off your,0.11666544
watch dogs when you let him go i don't want him around this afternoon i'm,0.27719206
taking no chances louie not even with you i mean telling him your full plan,0.13632336

that he's stealing his wife not so fast louie nobody's gonna be arrested not for,0.53490317
a while what i didn't see this coming under the circumstances i will sit down,0.11317976
good idea gun is pointed right at your heart that is my least vulnerable spot,0.43249398
i wasn't ready for this plot twist i had no idea airport huh this is,0.07611519
captain reynolds speaking there were two letters of trash and he called the german sheriff,0.5794725
guy it all adds up to one thing you're getting on that plane with victor,0.19529384
where you belong no what oh my god what what about us we'll always have,0.12516023
paris but she's gonna miss you for forever just when i think the plaque couldn't,0.10182208

way so they could go to america and continue to fight the good fight and,0.25744772
now rick's getting a little all inclusive vacation to lay under the radar for a,0.05220131
while to lay low and he gets to keep his bar sam stays employed carl,0.15285155
