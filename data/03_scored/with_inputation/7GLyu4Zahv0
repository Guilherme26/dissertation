married and he basically brings all he gets makes he blackmailed into bringing this the,0.09609689
two reporters in to to cover this and of course Jimmy Stewart's character of Macaulay,0.06430042
Connor he he's a writer and he gets blackmailer to covering it he doesn't really,0.14764376
want to do this he wants to be a serious writer he really wants to,0.13122453
quit the magazine and he works really a magazine I think they call it spies,0.07450248

to eat you know so they go along to this and during the course of,0.08970557
its base B of a day-and-a-half guess Oh kind of things are unfold like I,0.08545741
said Scott yeah that's good comedy but it's also a romance and it's also a,0.08985941
drama about things that people say and simply about Catherine's got the Hepburn's character Tracy,0.100333385
Lord for you basically getting to know her true self through her interactions with her,0.2582463

her father and she has this kind of it a strained relationship with her father,0.18522859
so she I she has daddy issues and stuff and I which I think drives,0.2920441
her a need to be young put the perfect okay which kind of drives away,0.4678443
kind of I think kind of drove away or ex-husband played by Cary Grant and,0.07492652
this is the young sense comedy that's really well done and again Jimmy Stewart won,0.086090975
an Academy Award I think her Best Supporting Actor in this and he's really good,0.06833211
at this because it is a guy who gets to know her and gets to,0.09945485
you know gets a kind of henchman character to reveal her true self and so,0.11319384
you see them interact so yeah it's a good chemistry out throughout the movie between,0.06980914
Cary Grant of course and Katharine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart and Katharine Hepburn and even,0.06893123
Ruth has a huge ego the long-suffering photographer who's the assistant to a genius to,0.22667162
his character and like I said it's a comedy and but it's also a drama,0.18845727
and and it's really are well done Candice in Philadelphia story because that's where the,0.052518602
marriage is taking a place and of course they're covering it so it's called the,0.10322119
Philadelphia Story but it's really well done it really well acted and Katharine Hepburn just,0.07737186
a really great actress and I don't know honey Academy Awards he won but she,0.10314005
is really good in this and she plays the part to perfection and again Craig,0.03941342
Wright you know it's not this movies much as a biggie is but he does,0.14967632
play a fire role in this okay and of course you need to what is,0.26275045

you know this wedding that he really doesn't want to do but he comes to,0.10799894
get to know you know Tracy's ordering and hurt his it and their interaction really,0.086265974
kind of opens the character up so it's really uh a really well done movie,0.060187485
like this screwball comedy but it's to me it's more of a drama a little,0.3433533
romance and then the comedy is in there as well and I definitely really enjoyed,0.07950782
the Philadelphia Story great back and forth between two characters so I'm gonna give the,0.024975473
Philadelphia Story a nine out of ten it's really a really well-done movie I think,0.07806623
they remade this as high society which I haven't seen I think that's the movie,0.11393063
with that Frank Sinatra I think being Cosby and I think it's four named Grace,0.18729211
Kelly I think that's I'm not sure about it but I think they remade it,0.09066647
the Philadelphia Story as a musical cause because you know Frank Sinatra and they're and,0.18656771
uh Bing Crosby I haven't seen that yet but this will be is really good,0.066618875
