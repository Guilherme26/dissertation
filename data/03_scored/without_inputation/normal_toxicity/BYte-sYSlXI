the stunts are incredible the cinematography is incredible to CG is incredible,0.073262274
that's a really good example I think of CG used well to accents the the practical stuff the cool cars being smashed up and destroyed and people doing awesome things it looks more in the trailer than I would say in the movie from what I remember what I watched the trailers it seemed like it was it was like all CG,0.14947028
I didn't get that from the movie at all it really works,0.04642612
it's not like a Transformers movie where it's just all this shiny fake stuff and you can't tell any robot from another robot and it's just it's like mind-numbing,0.2726889
there wasn't one part in this film where I didn't know what was going on and part of that again I think is the use of CG but also just the cinematography there is a lot of emphasis on wide shots like in the previous Mad Max films where you can actually see like wow,0.08730759

it's not,0.06844306
it's actually a really good example of a you know big budget huge summer action-movie that can be grapes and can be fun and awesome and exhilarating without being stupid and pandering and obnoxious and poorly acted but that requires like competent directors writers like George Miller not Michael Bay or Zack Snyder I'm hard-pressed to come up with anything negative about this movie when I first saw that it was two hours,0.5753181
