Wonder Woman is directed by patty Jenkins the director of monster and stars gal gadot as Diana Prince the film shows us her origins as she trained to become a warrior and eventually she meets Chris Pine a man who washes up on shore at her homeland and a man is very rare around those parts,0.048994914
and she then learns of World War 1 and wants to help and take part,0.12983645
and battle against the German and I went to this screening really excited but at the same time realistic I want to be a little reserved,0.23468809
and I don't like to get my hopes up because disappointment always sucks especially with big movies I'm excited for and the DC movie since Man of Steel haven't impressed me that much I haven't yet seen a great one one that I want to watch over and over and over that's a breath I've been holding since 2013 Wonder Woman is,0.52202857
the first really really legitimately good DC EU movie despite all of the hate that went her way when she got cast gal gadot owns the role of Wonder Woman,0.31089434
she reminded me of Christopher Reeve in the first Superman movie full of joy hope and completely without cynicism,0.3583601
this is a fantastic casting choice,0.05602441
she really nailed this role this movie was a total blast from start to finish,0.20149751
it has a lot of the things that I want to see in a superhero movie it's extremely funny Chris Pine has amazing chemistry with gal gadot and there's two fish-out-of-water stories in this movie the first act is Chris Pine in this place and he's like I don't get any of this,0.11102585
and everything is surprising to him and he's learning a lot about Diana and her upbringing,0.32100907
and then we have another fish out of the water story and that's Diana going away from her homeland and learning about the real world and what's going on there and world war one and so we get to see two characters who sort of teach each other things which I was really happy about because I didn't want to just go to this movie and see a perfect character with no flaws from the very beginning,0.07250553
she has a lot to learn she's very naive,0.52017057
and the film was wise to understand that,0.05761661
and it allows you to go on this journey with her and feel like you're experiencing all of her ups and downs emotionally,0.23979038
it's not just like she's born she's a perfect fighter,0.2099834
she's a superhero nobody can touch her she's not a Mary Sue that term that describes someone who's just perfect at everything a lot of people complain about ray in the force awakens that this very self-sufficient character that had virtually no flaws,0.23957768
that's very much,0.05341782
so not the case in Wonder Woman this isn't just about empowerment like this perfect person who hates men and doesn't like men and men suck,0.7888628
it's actually a very equal movie which is something,0.081658304
I was really excited about because I really didn't want to watch another Ghostbusters movie where the entire time I'm just reminded about how horrible I am because I'm a man this,0.1786956
actually it's very much,0.06321275
so the opposite of that which brings me to Chris Pine their chemistry is amazing,0.08309065
they both learn from each other and their relationship in the film went to emotional Heights that I did not expect,0.061289497
and I was genuinely touched by the end of the film I was really into that aspect of the movie which was a major surprise,0.08497842
and I found myself really caring but he brings a lot to the movie he's not just some guy that she's constantly saving because he's some weak guy like he actually brings quite a bit to her character and her to him they both really learn from each other,0.23966901
and there's a lot of times in the movie where patty Jenkins and the screenwriter,0.08960575
they took the time to have smaller moments,0.08064352
there's a scene where he teaches her how to dance and it really means a lot for their characters,0.1404954
but it's also the type of quiet small moment you don't normally get in movies like this and it makes their relationship so much more fleshed out and there's a lot of scenes like that I won't get into any spoilers,0.08752497
but there's a lot of times where the movie does slow down and lets these characters just be people,0.10897816
it's not just a mindless series of action scenes,0.23988014
there's quite a bit of action in it,0.08372451
and when the action is going down my god it's satisfying,0.12080718
there's a lot of tiny action moments,0.07405016
but there's like three major set pieces in each act,0.07725524
there's an incredible sequence on her homeland an amazing world war one sequence and of course the big epic finale that finale did get a little CGI heavy and it reminded me of some of the doomsday stuff in the end of VBS for some people that might be a turn-off,0.24018171
but here I thought it was handled considerably better in regards to the way it was all cut together,0.09522981
there is a lot of CGI and that's to be expected,0.074255645
because Wonder Woman is not normal,0.55703336
so that kind of shit's going to happen,0.91955
but since I actually cared about the characters this time around,0.05281064
I didn't mind as much when it got CGI heavy my biggest,0.10263455
gripe with Wonder Woman is pretty much,0.111431286
the same one I've had with most superhero movies as of late whether it's Marvel or DC,0.07442183
and that's the villain characters they're pretty weak there's like two or three in this movie,0.15957549
and some of them are just so poorly underdeveloped and they feel very hammy which doesn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and that was a major disappointment for me the movie is really long,0.3769457
but I think it works for this character you really needed to see her upbringing her roots where she came from why she is the way she is it wasn't just a bunch of padded scenes and they also wisely understood which elements of her origin to poke fun at which things sounded silly enough to make a joke out of it and so it wasn't just it was kind of like the way they did it with for like,0.40647215
Thor has some really silly and cheesy origins and they found ways to poke fun at it and make it entertaining enough so that you could at least get a joke out of it I talked about it briefly,0.51923007
but some of the action scenes are genuinely epic like the very definition of epic the score is also really exciting,0.050149783
and I'm looking forward to buying it all in all Wonder Woman is pretty much exactly what I would want out of a Wonder Woman movie I am so happy to say that this is the first great DC EU movie and I had a blast with it the villain characters could be better,0.15479308
this isn't like the best DC movie since the Dark Knight,0.060308333
I would say The Dark Knight Rises is probably still a better film but this is a blast,0.057750434
it's really fun also colorful,0.06321536
this is a really colorful movie it's not be saturated and depressing there's a ton of colors in almost every scene which oh my god just colors people,0.13642645
they really matter,0.046121
I'm going to give Wonder Woman an A - I really did have a blast with this one,0.44527256
