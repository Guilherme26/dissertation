all the way across the board the performances are mesmerizing and why I say they're,0.025615556
mesmerizing is just how what I love about these films from the 70s is that,0.03249688
these movies are so free from vanity or star type of acting like it's really,0.061158314
just actors up there living and breathing the characters these are real people James Caan,0.18141887
is Sonny Al Pacino is Michael Marlon Brando is the Godfather you know what I,0.036122132
mean they are these people in this movie when tired Shire is giving into it,0.06364943
with her with her abusive husband that woman is losing her mind for real that,0.23802619
ain't no acting that is the real deal in this petition like I will say,0.04687815
when I get into the business professionally and I become a fully working professional actor,0.028586267
and do films this is the type of level I'm talking about like I'm talking,0.04951095
about getting up there living it for real in front of the camera I ain't,0.043839592

living and breathing the characters in that moment where I'm feeling it we're in it,0.044322517
we are in the moment great great great stuff there's there's so many anything is,0.014865524
I had never seen the film but now I see where all the movies all,0.01820408
the gangster movies have stolen from this film you know that the famous quote I'm,0.13724402
gonna give him an offer I can't refuse in a you know Marlon Brando would,0.06419488
you come to me come for now one thing I will say about Marlon Brando,0.14919803
when I was in acting classes back in the beginning of my college career one,0.022178553
of my acting teachers moves like a Broadway guy from New York kind of thing,0.04246067
um his opinion of marlon brando was not the greatest because he was an actor,0.092570946
or stage actor he didn't feel Marlon Brando was as exceptional as everybody else thought,0.047326487
he would he also had a couple knocks on Kevin Costner where he said he,0.045455325
did they Kevin customer was a good actor I'm not getting it all that but,0.028730612
I'm just giving you guys opinions of like people who are tourists stage actors versus,0.056494713
you know people who are like actually stars character actors or whatever you get different,0.023248168
opinions I also remember digressive also back I think was 2002 or 2001 a filmed,0.02528496
Antwone Fisher in Cleveland I went up for extra work on that movie I never,0.056411564
got a call back which is fine 19 to 20 men but either way I,0.046779703
knew a woman who worked on that movie and she was an actress local stage,0.07289149
actress in the Cleveland area and I know that she had some scene - Denzel,0.07226887
all I know is direct quote from her life this ain't me this is her,0.07120658
she said well we was just making him look good take it as you may,0.051386103
I don't know if that's being bitter or whatever that's what the person said so,0.028241701
you have different opinions upon you know people who are stage actors and how they,0.04813801
feel about movie stars and their acting hey look my opinion is somebody who loves,0.023985857
to act and loves to perform and loves films I can only go off how,0.057923526
I feel and what I see and what I get from the actual performer you,0.037598174
know I would be a part of all this you know this person is bad,0.21745186
and that person is bad although we all have our opinions but whatever but anyway,0.060723286
back to the Godfather this does exist the kind of acting you see in this,0.03688909
movie you just you just don't see anymore you just go it's just pretty much,0.0712272
non-existent unless you watch like some movie some independent David Lynch movie streamed on online,0.047190122
or something like that that's the only time you get to see this kind of,0.038830094
acting the cinematography and this thing also stolen years later with that very kind of,0.076083705
I saw the net that Joaquin Phoenix movie we own the night words it's very,0.022396069
kind of muted kind of brown kind of tones and kind of a brown kind,0.28813386
of look she almost and hit my car because I asked him know how to,0.23095065
drive hi sorry oh um but he's very muted kind of brown kind of colors,0.27577138
or gritty kind of look you also saw that movie the yard with Mark Wahlberg,0.04054294
walking for you to remember I think it's the same director but I really love,0.020802954
the cinematography but I and I see how all the gangster kind of movies have,0.111207396
stolen from this movie and of course again I love how the camera scenes take,0.1792304
their time that's the difference with the 70s movies the scenes take the time with,0.0149633065
the when the camera sits there you feel like you're in the room with them,0.04224914
observing real people it's not like now we're like cut cut to close-up angle you,0.32571602
know there's a little bit of that in there but it doesn't feel so choppy,0.034414608
it doesn't feel like the movie is forcing you to pay attention to certain things,0.015454211
that they want you to see the movie really just feels like it's sitting there,0.023773663
in the room and you as the viewer make the choice of who your eyes,0.048845764
who you're going to look at you might be looking at everybody your eyes could,0.046239577
be drawn to certain people in the room 70s movies give you the option of,0.05268188
picking who you're going to observe in this room of people while you're watching observing,0.041564
what's happening in front of you are they just on beneath and scenes take they,0.047075048
take their time they say no rush we don't have to be rushed we take,0.03804119
our time take our time now yes all these movies this the deer hunter taxi,0.042226523
driver tons of movies from this air that are very very long I think the,0.030088916
big difference being is just everything that I just stated with an observer real life,0.04995396
does not go as quickly as we want it to when we apply for that,0.035126355
branding job you'll get that callback when we want to it could be six or,0.041889276
seven it could be months before we get a callback it could be months before,0.034556955
we get approved for our house whatever this is real time that's how it goes,0.01767526
you know it's not like this new filmmaking where hey I applied for a job,0.058408447
and I get the job tomorrow no no no this is happening I'm with them,0.02607919
as this happens when I went out I'm with Al Pacino over in Sicily and,0.058626626
I'm just observing all of this and I do love that scene where his wife,0.12294589
in Sicily just gets blown up that was the funniest thing where I love how,0.1648305
he's like he's like hey man what you doing I thought she's supposed to be,0.06500773
helping out my wife in the car he's like where you going this guy back,0.20094399
I mean my man took off in the car was like boom that was the,0.06917843
best I love that see it was the best it never has a firebombing been,0.1258175
so funny in the movie I'm sorry I loved that scene but this is just,0.035570696
great now um a criticism criticism I Marlon Brando okay I understand that this is,0.03659907
an iconic performance I get that and I do get a little butthurt when people,0.2725099
talk about movies that I grew up with and I love I did not grow,0.021406274
up with The Godfather this film came out way before I was born but I,0.027172752
knew of it my entire life Marlon Brando's performance to me is slightly excuse me,0.1035518
slightly hammy slightly slightly I'm not knocking it but it only seems to get hammy,0.053197395
when he kind of I think there's like a scene where like the guy who,0.08037148
is the singer is talking about how he can't get this role in the movie,0.01719167
and he wants them to do some pool for him so he could get him,0.0735733
a job in the movie and he goes like we're crying he kind of made,0.061699774
fun of them there those kind of moments where he kind of go over exerts,0.09011176
I kind of feel he's hammy but when he really just Marlon Brenda just chills,0.07600521
and acts he just goes like oh I think he's very good I really like,0.06016852
the scene oh that's his real life son but where he scares the kid with,0.0939226
the teeth before he has a heart attack I really like that team I really,0.15768377
like a lot of things between him and James Caan and I think there's the,0.05888405
one in particular that sets off the war between the different families but we're the,0.038518123
guys like Caleb wants you to get in on this drug trade with me and,0.18120933
you know Marlon Brando's like I'm going to no you do what you do I'm,0.14007637
not really feeling that James Collin kind of jumps in I really like that scene,0.042142045
I thought there was a really good dynamic of highlight the father is kind of,0.026234178
more like you chill you don't be disrespectful you know you don't let another man,0.065000415
know what you're thinking you just chill be like no I'm good you do what,0.044740252
you do I do what I do and James Caan is just kind of like,0.034177136
nah man I'm not feeling this dude at all but I like how you got,0.06951701
that little dynamic there you can really see that that character of James Caan Sonny,0.029852778
was like stolen from a lot of movies you know the you know the Joe,0.07361787
Pesci is old dog for menace to society jeremy renner in the town that style,0.26774362
character of the off the handle family of friend member has been just stolen a,0.1131198
million gangster movies but um this is just a great movie and I also love,0.14975213
how they show that the women in this world to quote John bender from The,0.25539413
Breakfast Club need to shut up and go fix me a turkey potpie stay in,0.34843174
your place you know it's crazy man I love out of the city the movie,0.1569268
with Diane Keaton and Al Pacino and one thing about Pacino in this movie is,0.021762813
he starts out just kind of like an observer of his family's activities but he'll,0.03142793
want no part of it and has he and as he grows in the family,0.03701215
and becomes you know become the new Godfather I love how you can see how,0.058692478
that infects him you know he's kind of more starry-eyed and naive at the beginning,0.20957342
of the movie and by the end he's just like the rest of them you,0.08800912
know and he's just as cold and calculating like the rest of them but you,0.07968567
have to be in this business but I love how when Diane Keaton comes to,0.018309845
him goes that's not true what you did to such and such my man looks,0.0730039
right in her face and lies and goes no and she goes I need you,0.32050592
but the thing I love about the scene is that's the lie of when these,0.08450892
women are with men were part of organized crime they don't want to believe that,0.23890747
the person they love is the fly they don't want to believe that the person,0.039597053
they love is organized crime so he tells it which she wants to hear no,0.16096513
but they both knows BS fantastic scene thumbs up the video subscribe to the channel,0.06953364
