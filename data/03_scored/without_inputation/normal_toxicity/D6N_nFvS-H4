hello,0.054463096
i am the movie maestro welcome to another film review during the 1940s,0.08693442
there was a certain uprising in the craving for films with a darker mood and a darker attitude but with the sense of likeability still in there and that's where this film comes along the third man directed by carol reed the film was released in 1949 strangers of lena valley and orson welles joseph cotten place Holly Martin's an out-of-work poke novelist who has travelled to Vienna then divided into four separate quadrants because of a job offer to buy an old friend in Harry Lime played by Orson Welles however he arrives there to find out that lie mysteriously died in a traffic accident of sorts however as time passes by he realizes that it was a setup and eventually he goes on a quest to try and solve the mystery regarding where his friend is gone,0.025810504
the story is very simple and very basic,0.07350318
and yet there's a surprisingly effective amount of suspense and atmosphere brought to life very well in this particular film it has pretty much all,0.07585177
the qualities of what makes a good film the war,0.14344917
and yet there are some interesting little touches here and there that make it stand out easily,0.08868449
the best thing about this film is the cinematography in the atmosphere like most films of its genre especially for its time the shadows are excellent it plays with the imagination in numerous effective points,0.07137942
even though there's not exactly a lot of violence a lot of mystery and the amateurs almost palpable in places also the sets are very well designed,0.113079056
and the characters if not that memorable by film noir standards in comparison to most others still have enough like ability to make them bootable or non rootable as the case may be,0.07596966
and of course,0.051170148
there's the femme fatale who ends being rather unconventional probably the best performer in this film however is Orson Welles's Harry Lime even though he's not in the film very much,0.09772997
and yet a lot comes across about his very bizarre viewpoints of the world and it's pretty shocking considering the time period that it came about the suspense present in this film is actually quite incredible especially considering how high the stakes feel by the end,0.06681782
when lime is finally getting a chance to be cornered also the ending is very very very empty,0.1824861
probably one of the emptiest endings that I personally have experienced upon watching a film very dark very slow very somber and all it is is just the simple image of a repetition of an earlier scene towards the beginning of the film really nothing in particular happens that seems significant and yet a lot is said about how it's a very empty,0.07617802
ending very typical in the film or genre,0.119006306
it's also surprising,0.065231495
how really furious the chase towards the end feels the climax is very very intense,0.14671761
and it's surprising how effective,0.055454418
it is considering as there's no music and there's not too much action going on in that scene and yet by the time it's done,0.081478365
it's hard not to feel kind of the empty feeling that usually happens when one feels the satisfaction that having achieved their goal in that way,0.07790694
this is one of the more depressing film noir is out there,0.18963927
I'll confess,0.051468883
though I wasn't 100% crazy about this film maybe it's just because the characters could have been a little more interesting than they were because they were rather basic,0.2750254
but at the same time they did have enough character traits that made them interesting enough by general film character standards,0.06876551
though rather simple in film noir standards,0.085874185
the one thing that almost would have gotten negative criticism for me,0.10406709
I'll admit was the music Alex Karras the ziller music is so immensely optimistic that if it weren't for the fact that it thankfully does know when to be quiet during the more serious moments that might have turned out a little early sufferable,0.086116455
I mean at first it's enjoyable and it's certainly catchy but feels like there could have been something a little more to it,0.07457383
but maybe that's just me overall,0.06576792
the third man is a great example of a genre anybody who is interested in classic film noir should definitely give this from a watch it's interesting enough to keep the audience invested even though it's not what I call one of my personal favorites even for that genre it's definitely worth checking out every now,0.1048335
and then the characters though basic have a little bit of intrigue in there the stakes are surprisingly high and it has probably one of the best climb axes and conclusions that you'll find in the genre and I think that's enough to warrant seeing it every now and then parsing it if the need arises on the worth meter,0.081000976
I'd give it a worth wrenching,0.0921333
and I give this 3.5 out of 5 on the star rating,0.05946376
thank you for your time,0.057409495
