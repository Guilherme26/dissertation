hello everybody I'm Tiffany and today I am doing another movie review let's go I,0.023123778
went to the movie theaters recently with Eddie hi Eddie hi Kevin I had a,0.0106662195
great time it was SuperDuper fun got to go to my theater where I work,0.035200853
I have been dying to see this movie ever since it came out in theaters,0.099656485
it's really really new I've been super excited about it and I finally saw it,0.070120335
thanks to Eddie the movie I am talking about is Dunkirk by Christopher Nolan is,0.02032136
a war movie directed by Christopher Nolan I don't think you know this but Christopher,0.0722855
Nolan is my favorite director I love his movies I love them my favorite movie,0.03469465
is inception that I don't think people would think that I think they think it's,0.03685982
Titanic but its inception because that movie has Christopher Nolan and leader Eric Caprio who,0.029982487
is my favorite actor so anything that Christopher Nolan comes out with I will jump,0.1298598
on to see whether people say they like it or not I really like this,0.046738464
jacket too it kind of had the army green so that's why I wore it,0.020586768
and it's really comfortable I wanted to wear it I was definitely a little bit,0.04062343
worried going into this movie just because when you work at the movie theatres you,0.0576508
do hear a lot of the feedback from guests on movies sometimes and I got,0.021136211
really mixed reviews there were some people saying it was great it was wonderful and,0.038536083
then I had people saying it was slow and kind of boring and some even,0.07213385
said it was a little bit confusing but that's a little bit of Christopher Nolan,0.034309506
because let's face it every movie is kind of confusing till it comes to its,0.056132853
end and then you get it and it's this mind-blowing asset so I was a,0.13491854
little bit worried going in but it's off the Christopher Nolan and you always produce,0.053635087
this good content so even his movies that maybe consider not as good really really,0.048576366
good I knew despite what I heard I was going to see it anyway and,0.04362873
I got a lot of good reviews more than anything I really wasn't that worried,0.013760654
about not liking this movie I really loved it and I'm not sure if it's,0.06683765
because I'm biased towards Christopher Nolan and I'm gonna love everything he did but I,0.045402776
thought it was awesome it was a great movie it's not that long of a,0.07649945
movie which is weird Christopher Nolan so I don't know if that throws people off,0.10900298
a little bit it's holding in our and 46 minutes so the fact that Christopher,0.039934967
Nolan and it's a war movie which usually doesn't pretty well was kind of shocking,0.15896626
it was that short but I really did like the pace of it overall I,0.035180233
felt it was well built throughout and I thought everybody did a really great job,0.025525758
in this movie definitely an anxiety ridden Leto just letting you know um people told,0.033164725
me they were bored but for me I was just panicking and throughout this entire,0.03205653
movie I'm pretty sure I jumped and scared Eddie a lot I'm sorry about that,0.054241735
can be frustrating a little bit at times and I think the music score in,0.054082755
the background makes it that much more intense because the music in the background is,0.018813388
literally o'clock and when you hear the clock going to tick tick tick tick you're,0.056705575
like what is coming what is going right now and the music was built and,0.025643494
then something would happen but then I go back to the Speaking Clock I just,0.040429197
like you know if you're not looking for a super super be nervous throughout the,0.0538087
entire movie experience to enjoy watch it just watch something mellow and calm when you're,0.037458487
wanting to feel that nervous heart pounding energy watch this movie for those of you,0.28405723
who want statistics this right now has 8.5 out of 10 on IMDB I don't,0.024019117
know it's going to stay there because again it just came out really recently that's,0.047494777
a really good rating and I really don't think it's going to drop that much,0.042911664
farther that's a reasonable T the movie is that rating it's really really good I,0.05573241
think it definitely deserves an 8 or above I loved it I thought it was,0.09944362
fantastic for the actors one thing that I love about this movie especially being a,0.06014524
young aspiring actress myself is seeing all of these new faces that are getting their,0.076101
breakthroughs I'm pretty sure they've been in the business forever because if you don't know,0.04576663
the system takes forever seeing a movie that's really big directed by this really big,0.01973733
known director and seeing that he put all of these newer faces on the screen,0.030306432
along with some veterans that have been in there forever it felt really nice to,0.0262548
see that and the fact that the main characters in there are played by newer,0.011010785
actors was really nice you're mainly following these newer actors and doing a warning right,0.10017333
now I'm sorry about the nasty names mom there's Phelan Whitehead I don't know pronounced,0.24223354
that way I'm sorry Jamie and Lonard ineuron bernard a bunch of other people harry,0.085290514
styles in this if you like one direction bow Harry Styles he did actually good,0.02829159
job in this so good job Harry style there's more violence Cecilia Murphy there's Kenneth,0.07907504
Branagh Tom Hardy a lot of really great actors and then these newer people and,0.047013186
I really liked that combination for those of you learning synopsis it recreates the historical,0.042557783
events that happened it was a battle on Dunkirk France and basically the battle was,0.020570138
lost the Allies realized that so the British Army decided to try and evacuate their,0.036250513
troops to safety before they can actually all get injured the story is done basically,0.04072587
trying to get these troops back home to England while the Axis powers are constantly,0.16979478
coming at them and trying to stop them and they're on this whole little beach,0.13983424
alone and out in the open so they're pretty easy targets and they're not afraid,0.09160577
to go for those targets the historical event can learn about it go learn about,0.07416332
it Lauren history overall it was really really good I really liked it overall I,0.03928974
don't know if everybody will like it just because again getting the mixed reviews I,0.03272238
think some people will some people long I appreciated the length of it it's weird,0.07332984
see Christopher Nolan in a war movie combines not being SuperDuper long but I do,0.06135521
appreciate that it was short because it kept that intense energy level throughout the movie,0.014849559
for me and I saw it in so many mills which is really cool being,0.05068766
a film fanatic I was really happy my theater was playing it in some new,0.13607661
millimeter that's really all I can tell you without spoiling you goodbye non-spoilery people go,0.22854374
watch John Kirk and then come back and then we can discuss all the fields,0.032193556
and your anxiety levels when you come back love you guys goodbye thunder now I,0.10236444
don't know why when I first saw the trailers I thought Tom Hardy was a,0.020669917
bad guy because they always showed him in the airplanes and I airplanes were always,0.0938328
long the beach where all these helpless soldiers are and my mind I'm thinking that,0.036301732
Tom Hardy is the bad guy luckily he wasn't I loved rooting for Tom Hardy,0.052377224
throughout that and he saves there but I was really proud of Tom Hardy even,0.02533352
though his name is an actually Tom Hardy in this Sun I'm still going to,0.017425817
call him Tom Hardy that was a really nice moment in hearing them cheer and,0.058758996
seeing him finally defeat those plays those planes were mourning oh my gosh I cannot,0.11305727
tell you how many times you would hear it and you just wanted to scream,0.050357062
duck at the screen and take cover and you knew people were going to die,0.42362052
and it was soul-crushing because it's every time they got into I they're reloading ship,0.09807867
they launch the ship and it slips and boom I do think that out of,0.04264426
everything you do get a personal connection to some of the characters but not a,0.019309616
ton of them you don't get a super super super super deep connection to anybody,0.103857785
if you got a deep connection to anybody I think it'd be more violence is,0.174177
character and to Dawson and his son I think those are the characters I personally,0.024313128
was invested in the most and I really wanted them to get to Dunkirk and,0.025651477
be able to help all be soldiers not just because I wanted them to help,0.0399037
all these soldiers but because they were genuine good people all the other ones I,0.1126116
have sympathy for them don't get me wrong and I felt really bad for all,0.041872647
the soldiers but there wasn't a moment of complete utter panic for one character for,0.02100783
me like the moment where gifts and I think dice that didn't impact me I,0.02847385
think as much as it should have I really felt for him and I didn't,0.03426627
wanted today and seeing him struggle in that water was painful it didn't really make,0.025449926
me cry or anything like that because there wasn't enough personal knowledge about the character,0.034892872
for me to actually have an emotional impact on that don't hit me don't get,0.0394853
me wrong and for me what hit me more were situations they were put in,0.11685813
then the actual characters getting hurt themselves it was the risk of danger they were,0.025618883
in and all the soldiers were sitting in that boat waiting for the tide to,0.03257338
come portrayed so they were able to move the ball and get out of there,0.03877954
and they are being shot at and that one guy gets shot in the eye,0.6206133
and then water swirling in and they're threatening to kick gifts and out because he's,0.2526244
French and he should stay behind that was all really intense and I wanted to,0.09193437
prevent them just get out of the stupid boat this is pointless you're not going,0.39487374
into where you're going to drown and then get some done you should just listen,0.43686447
so that's what I meant if those intense situations I felt for that but there,0.012855339
wasn't a moment in there for me where you saw a really tragic kuroh of,0.04615842
destiny even the end with Tom Hardy he gets taken in by the German soldiers,0.1842419
and I get that and he probably dies and that's heart was powerful with the,0.17155619
airplane burning and sacrificing himself knowing that he's going to probably die that was powerful,0.373943
the younger soldiers I didn't have as much of an impact mr. Dawson and his,0.022457264
son and then Tom Hardy's character in the pilots I really felt for throughout and,0.015563967
I felt for the soldiers too don't get me wrong just not as much as,0.040245607
the others I think it's because the pilots and mr. Dawson in them we're the,0.021090312
ones who could go and save them all where the soldiers themselves were really helpless,0.040348046
so you felt helpless with them but there really wasn't anything you could do so,0.021355055
you were really rooting for the people who could actually go out and do something,0.046558198
and the soldiers in here it's them trying to survive and you feel that and,0.022088088
they don't always do the most righteous thing but they want to survive I thought,0.02300471
Philly a murphy's character was really interesting though the shell-shocked soldier I was really obsessed,0.019677462
on he killed George I was really mad I like spud orders in the paper,0.3895604
at the end though I did like his character overall he was really interesting I,0.0193615
just wish he was in the movie more I think that's the only problem with,0.06385963
the length that I do like the pace but it kind of feels like your,0.032617945
interactions with each character gets cut short if the movie was longer and we get,0.043335386
more invested in the characters and learn about them more Julie emerges character it was,0.016352875
really impactful and you saw war before the guy but he knocks down this kid,0.11494174
and then to have mr. Dawson son telling him that yeah he's going to be,0.05382932
okay when the boy is actually really died to save the soldier from any more,0.2554595
grief so that's the only thing is that I feel like if the movie was,0.035493534
longer I'd have more of an impact with the characters because you whip them longer,0.38737
not only like characters to be tortured don't get me wrong I just want to,0.21765009
be really personally invested in them and I was in a way just not another,0.014955324
way that scene at the beginning with them trying to get the injury man I,0.04321964
thought they were gonna miss it I'm sorry I thought that was that type of,0.019255737
movie luckily they did it but did oh my gosh then the bone explodes and,0.07241522
the guy's still on there and I was just sitting there one of my hands,0.06634741
my face thinking this was all for nothing they just saved this guy he's a,0.1416595
tunnel then he's been you know we dead I was really mad that was me,0.24414429
and Christopher Nolan because that was a tease because you think they're going to miss,0.04455001
the boat because Christopher Nolan isn't all about super happy happy you don't think they're,0.028068755
going to make the boat but then they do make the bull and then they,0.051352844
can't go on the boat so that's that but then you realize that the guy,0.020063935
that they just put on the boat they just doomed it even more because this,0.06589509
ship tips over Wow way to just play with my emotion and make me think,0.05785235
this guy was somehow going to survive I did get a little bit how people,0.118947476
said it was kind of confusing though there was a timeline element that they did,0.017380584
and at first I was a little confused enjoyed by that when it really first,0.020908717
happened to me that was the Cillian Murphy's character again because we see him on,0.018994318
the boat with mr. Dawson but then it cuts to this moment where he's denying,0.02624748
soldiers to be in this boat not enough room the boat he says and so,0.017616725
find another one and the characters he's talking to are the main soldiers that you're,0.022201834
following and so I was really confused at that because it showed him before he,0.0136169745
was shell-shocked and I was just like wait he was just shell-shocked on this boat,0.04513271
wait what her moments like that timeline wise where it wasn't clear that I was,0.02533751
jumping back and moving forward and drumming documenting forward English go deuces deuces deuces just,0.35141897
like that that was a little bit confusing everything that was Rebecca know had to,0.029315973
do with water because since they were on a beach and surrounded by water they're,0.034817707
all drowning it Somali where the pilot is docked at the plane and the water,0.28027436
is coming in I was panicking in family I did not know they were going,0.04356088
to make it asking about for Carolyn if you don't know you really don't know,0.040658686
if they're going to be kick or not the main moments were when the water,0.17566834
was slowly rising and I'm just like this keeps happening they all keep getting stuck,0.019280348
in water channel of water I'm a swimmer this may be not like water in,0.033164725
the movie I'm sorry water I love you you keep me refreshed I have a,0.02397854
glass right here I love you but in the movie you were mean and I,0.116568774
promise characters a little bit confused about again I think it was the lack of,0.02586234
not really getting to know him it's supposed to be this really nice moment when,0.022661477
he says he's going to stay behind and help his fellow countrymen and help the,0.030064305
French in some way and I think that was really noble I just feel again,0.05379207
if we had more of a connection to him personally then it'd be even more,0.035377126
impactful that he's staying behind but it still was a really good strong statement everything,0.033390224
needed here was strong statement and I really enjoyed it it's just upping the level,0.045805875
a little bit and then it would have been completely mind-blowing though it was so,0.08615791
basically mind blowing that's really all I have to say about this movie if you,0.1613669
haven't seen Dunkirk I don't get why you stayed through spoilers but you know what,0.01584667
go go and watch Dunkirk because it's a really good movie overall I think I,0.11816655
would have wanted it to be a little longer just to have more character development,0.06633344
but at the same time I really liked the pace of it and it made,0.01599434
me really anxious throughout this entire thing Thank You Eddie for coming with me that,0.03285342
was really fun let's go again thank you so much for joining me today if,0.04176954
