I feel like the Hollywood thing going forward is gonna be alright we're gonna take,0.025841719
an actor who's known generally for comedic things so John Krasinski has stepped out of,0.040827643
it since the office but he's more or less known for the office we'll have,0.016014962
them direct a thriller because apparently it really works a quiet place so what quiet,0.13104583
place is directed by John Krasinski he also gets writing credit on the movie along,0.023540849
with a couple of other people and it more or less revolves around this family,0.04241743
in this house in the middle of what looks like a farm and for a,0.033553194
while now they have dealt with this situation the situation being is kind of a,0.027196033
post-apocalyptic scenario you don't see much outside the farm so you don't really know how,0.024333082
the rest of the world is dealing with it I can't glance at all the,0.02617431
newspaper clippings I saw somewhat get the gist just being there are these aliens in,0.06489332
the world really feral aliens and if you make a sound they are drawn to,0.12995361
sound if they hear you they will scamper over to you and tear you apart,0.21428758
they'll shred you lose this family trying to sneak around going about their day-to-day not,0.14462356
making sound those sounds probably will happen and we've now set the stage for a,0.014332047
very effective thriller call it a thriller I know some people like I don't like,0.0298428
horror movies not as much a horror movie as it is a thriller a very,0.06337005
fine line between thriller and horror movie I feel like this movie really walks at,0.04141034
well everyone in this movies great John Krasinski and Emily Blunt there's a scene in,0.028722629
particular where I'm like emily Blunt's crushing it right now I even have a couple,0.1238073
of kids in the movie sometimes that is just your day away at that point,0.043687932
not these kids these kids are great I'm kind of doing a flyby talking about,0.08708052
oh they were all good in the movie but really they're great in the sense,0.04084028
that one very huge part of communication is generally speaking gone in his movies everything,0.042946253
they have to do they have to convey without words all the fear all the,0.03077339
intensity any of the emotions their face their body language these are the tools because,0.08340073
their voices just can't happen they can't talk they do they do sign language in,0.030750774
the movie that's the primary form of communication but let me just say that this,0.022109374
is a thriller based on life and death in which the most intense of conversations,0.23032674
are conveyed through sign language and it completely works that's not very conventional they'll do,0.021408936
a fantastic job operating in this world this movie has brought you into immediately this,0.08101804
movie brings you in on this world where you as the audience you feel like,0.03940548
you can barely breathe you definitely can't make any sounds there were these people behind,0.12026786
me they were talking as the movie was starting I was like oh my god,0.053498726
a few times no immediately you get that feeling of oh we can't make sounds,0.031245671
and the theaters shut up even people who cough they were like oh my god,0.38936102
nope you die not quiet enough it's quite a thing when you can make the,0.5252151
audience really feel like they're in the movie to the point where it's like making,0.03368091
any sounds whatsoever people are critical in their rappers to get their candy like and,0.050530676
it doesn't so effectively because it illustrates how easy it is to make sound as,0.02086149
homo sapiens are not stealthy the human race we're loud we're clunky we're not quiet,0.27765167
that's why stealth is a skill that you have to faster I drop a little,0.024461463
knickknacks and things all the time but if you do that in this world you,0.40446645
die a big thing this movie illustrates it's how adaptable people are you will adapt,0.49689472
to survive in most situations and if you don't adapt good news you get to,0.018671704
die early so you can see how they get food you get to see their,0.30624455
operations it makes the world feel very lived in a movie like this or any,0.026000699
apocalyptic type setting when it revolves around a family or a group of people and,0.11115818
they don't really show how will they be survived if I allow myself to pick,0.032542113
it apart I have to ask the question like how have you survived this long,0.0416691
this movie shows how they've survived this long it shows they do have a system,0.03754895
doesn't mean this movie doesn't drag on in part so for my first watch I,0.01497794
was still glued I was like it shows the world I really this movie makes,0.034718595
you reflect on human beings in general how much we rely on noise for communication,0.10484625
for a release I don't know how this movie got conjured up but the fact,0.03340885
that they're in a very intense scenario I almost feel like someone was in a,0.023722444
very intense scenario and they just had to release it had to scream they had,0.029592024
to have a big cry and they thought what if you couldn't do that and,0.04511209
that's what you really feel in this movie no one can cry no one can,0.036756054
scream no one can take a stick and smack a tree with it so all,0.4718206
the pain anger and emotions as families dealing with they haven't had a release that,0.026447037
is straight up a version of hell they're in hell and since they're feeling that,0.23866495
this movie does a good job of bringing you into the movie you start feeling,0.054901596
it every intense scenario and there are a few of them you don't have release,0.04223384
you don't go you actually do the and you stop breathing this movie really preys,0.46969897
on your fight-or-flight and you just freeze in place gotta hand it to a movie,0.085374326
for doing that I mean when you first meet the family having all the noise,0.0474542
go out when the cameras on the girl and having the ambient always come back,0.07542784
when the cameras on the Sun it's genius and illustrating a couple things not only,0.05684992
one of the things about one of the characters but also illustrating the contrast between,0.019551078
quiet and sound does she realize how noisy the world is thus you realize how,0.122393124
hard it is to be quiet cause you realize the danger but I start to,0.049361948
roll my eyes are moments where I'm like alright I've seen this before in movies,0.04073252
and it was just as cliche there well there'd be a particular scenario I'm not,0.023695173
gonna spoil anything there's a scenario that takes longer than the 10 minutes it actually,0.04079172
took and any time you have to bloody hand slapping onto the window I'm like,0.5088916
that is just that's just how many times does that happen well chalk up one,0.027002465
more because in the a quiet place was really unique my biggest flaw in the,0.046611413
movie he's just simply where the movie ends not that the movie ends but where,0.02532088
the movie ends where they decided to go you know what that's the end end,0.039389513
credits just didn't like it gonna keep it vague but personally with me did not,0.026594708
dig that choice but in the end I thought John Krasinski crushed it every the,0.121578276
movie did a great job I was at the edge of my seat I was,0.034507733
white knuckling it and I will say a quiet place is definitely worth watching and,0.5070917
definitely worth buying on blu-ray one of those movies you watch like I want my,0.051012933
