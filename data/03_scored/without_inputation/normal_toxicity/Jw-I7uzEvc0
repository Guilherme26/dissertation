so you can imagine my surprise when I walked out feeling like I had just seen the best animated movie of 2018 spider-man into the spider-verse is based on the Marvel Comics character Miles Morales who exists in a multiverse where multiple spider-man's and a woman and a pig are brought together and they have to kind of fight for a common purpose,0.3548159
it is an absolutely bonkers premise,0.49388537
but the movie walks the fine line between being way too weird and just weird enough and we can thank the team of Phil,0.07737823
Lord and Chris Miller for that they're of course behind the movie franchises like lego movie 21 Jump Street Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,0.22887677

Stephen so let's hear it for Snohomish County okay back to spider-man the script is really terrific,0.101191215
it's a great blend of edgy humor and irreverence self-aware superhero platitudes and genuine emotion and it's supported by a truly spectacular cast including the Herschel Olly lily tomlin Christine and Nicolas Cage as the totally memorable spider-man noir but shameik Moore who plays miles is the true standout he's a spider-man I found myself laughing at and with rooting for and sometimes comparing to my own kid but the greatest achievement of this movie is the animation,0.15007442
it is gorgeous,0.09432117
and unlike anything I have ever seen before,0.14860238
it looks like comic book panels come to life they actually innovated new ways to do animation just for this movie so seriously every frame is art and purposeful,0.1066641
