what our peeps Tony Baker here back with another movie review this time,0.073477924
I'm reviewing spider-man into the spider verse,0.1780419
it's a dope little animated concept a Spider Man,0.31672594
and this is Spider Man this miles morales in comic books,0.15102358
they always do alternate universes all the time that way they can always change the narrative they can add new characters keep the character the same but make a little tweak on them,0.07980087
and then you don't have to restart anything else in the main universe,0.15633951
so spider-man Miles Morales is a kid from New York,0.322433
now in this reality,0.07080781
okay Peter Parker just died spider-man and so this is kid from New York Miles Morales who is bitten by a radioactive spider big surprise,0.26966858
he's in viewed with the powers as well this time,0.09355896
he has a tweak on his powers,0.19283724
he has a slow electric burst that he can do any could turn invisible Miles Morales New York kid,0.3224042
you know I'm saying black and Latino he's just in New York,0.31089434
you know say which is very New York to have a a biracial kid in New York City,0.21243285
that's this very realistic,0.062011097
so Peter Parker dies and then there's interdimensional gate that's open switches everything up,0.2737588
so now Peter Parker from a different dimension shows up and miles is dimension,0.071895435
and so it's like the Peter,0.06798724
Parker that let himself go him and Mary Jane split up,0.082099214
so he's just like you know he's gonna show him the ropes on being spider-man in his reality,0.31089434
but he still got to get Peter Parker back to his original reality,0.081393525
it's kind of confusing but it's not really it's very easy to follow when you watch it but when you sit here and listen to me tell us you're probably like what not only that there's other spider people from different dimensions that show up as well,0.08776098
so it's a whole bunch of spider people they show up and they're like yo,0.1944665
we got to get back cuz if they stay and miles is I don't know how you say miles in poor form if they stay in his dimension they'll end up dying,0.40000993
so it's like we got to get you guys back,0.08464873
you know that's the and so that's pretty much what the movies about and it's also you know miles coming to grip with you know I'm the spider-man how do i how do I adjust to this new life,0.11475107
you got a spider ham in there the new are spider-man just like anime spider girl things,0.3900874
so it's all kind of different,0.052259974
spider people coming together for this,0.18580103
one mission in this dope,0.40321106
it's like a different concept,0.066946104
the animation is something I've never seen before and it looks like it's it looks like it's supposed to be 3d,0.12799308
you know a 3d movies look when you got the glasses off and you could tell like are they daddy's on it kind of looks like that except it's easier to see,0.12905784
and then when you watch it in 3d it's pretty much dope to it feels very current very fresh very with the times Myles is young you know a smart kid,0.27626413
you know the main and so all of that works,0.069421336
and then the original Peter Parker is coming to show them the ropes and everything works it's like you know you care about spider-man,0.16043375
spider-man is somebody that you always want to see done,0.16828573
well okay even the bad spider-man 3 that was horrible everybody still wanted more spider-man,0.4032278
it's not like they just give up,0.13469177
nobody ever said just give up on spider-man know you've like all right,0.2401076
let's try to get you always willing to try it again,0.07208507
and I think this animated step is very fresh and dope and I'm glad they didn't send it just straight to DVD well a lot of people overlook,0.24062087
oh it's a good time man,0.101036645
there's a good time at the theater,0.037515227
it was funny you cared about the characters,0.080657884
I was just dope to see the action was cool,0.13392255
the Jordans were fresh,0.05530585
you know what I mean and that was dope to see as well one of the takeaways from this is the Stanley effect know we all know he just passed,0.12100529
so it was like man,0.19477828
if he shows up in this movie will we fold up,0.11212941
cuz Stanley had an amazing run 95 years old with love you know just brought so much joy to,0.053451728
so many people so when you see us my home and he's in this,0.07033891
so you know be ready for that another takeaway is I don't always wonder like who's cleaning up the spiderwebs in the in the city spider spider man's been web slinging all throughout the city who's cleaning that up what happens to the spider where do they dissolve after certain time because in real life spiders are messy as hell and I'm sick,0.3781959
oh they don't clean up they make spider webs in your house and you're calling all your ceilings whatever and they just leave them in like packages when you get across reel it back in take it with you,0.1248893
you don't say this very is very selfish,0.40316465
the spiders a Spider Man is just as selfless,0.093252674
he's webbing up the whole city I'd never see him cleaning it up,0.15170212
I've never seen that I want to see him my art sorry guys pulling it off the wall because in real life you'd be spider webs everywhere man spider-man saving the day with Jesus,0.2432671
its webs all over the place,0.07736917
I don't want answers on that front man and in real life spiders,0.2970553
if you're watching my YouTube page real spiders clean your up man sick of y'all out here just leaving the way I'm walking through them every night in the summertime,0.46987206
no regard for nobody but yourselves and your meal,0.2546288
I'll tell you this,0.069082595
if I see a bug get trapped in your web like right,0.23992217
I see it happen,0.068848416
I'm saving that book just just out of spite cuz,0.24206735
I'm like you wrong for not cleaning up after yourself,0.3738888
and then when they leave the food behind the disrespect of the food left,0.10757671
you don't even finish the carcass you drink the insides then you leave the whole carcass posted up in the kitchen in the ceiling sick of y'all man anyway y'all want to know the smooth jazz review let's fight a man into the spider-verse would hear it,0.47289646
I'm giving spider-man into the spider-verse four saxophones out of five,0.15080544
ah but the spiderwebs oh man for real,0.25439873
if I turn around what if I turned around into the spider with would they be there to clean it up problem,0.14482182
