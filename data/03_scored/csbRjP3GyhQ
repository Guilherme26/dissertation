are swept into action when they have to take care of a young usage was,0.15412198
on the run from an evil corporation this movie is one of my most anticipated,0.25079417
movies of the year because i love the trailer for the film I'm talking specifically,0.050152533
about the Johnny Cash trailer when I saw the trailer for this movie I thought,0.057499867
two things either this film is going to be amazing all the person who make,0.09229436
the stranger deserves an Oscar for it because it's incredible and now that I've seen,0.14757505
the movie I can face that the trailer is very very accurate if you've seen,0.114435054
that trailer you understand what the film is about and you also get the exact,0.077344194
food and feel of the film this is a gut-wrenching powerful emotional beautiful film it's,0.09353966
like the dark knight of Marvel films in the definite transcends the comic book genre,0.05500247
and it's just a really good film that happens you have to book characters in,0.055925835
so yeah I used to confirm that what everybody's raving about them and everybody said,0.1550752
this movie is amazing yes that's right this movie is awesome so let's begin and,0.07470391
start talking about the softly things that i like but Logan not really the r-rating,0.10671519
thank you Dark Knight trilogy for existing and letting us have some best tweet comic,0.09485062
book storylines with respect and take them serious and thank yous s fools for learning,0.8355208
to use know that you can make an already comic book film and it can,0.1316291
be good and it can be relatively successful because without those two things we would,0.05877376
not have had Logan and now we have Wolverine unleashed so we finally get to,0.06695696
see what we actually kick some ass decapitating head dismembering people is adamantium claws or,0.8570403
bloody and they are shots in people's faces and it was glorious and awesome the,0.7093121
number two thing I liked about Logan is the moon this film is a very,0.053745735
heavy dark slow him it really reflects the way that Logan fields in this film,0.16384187
he's old tired and beaten emotionally and physically it's not the usual light-hearted kind of,0.31089434
film that you find in x-men franchise film it feels more like a Western or,0.08396199
low-budget independent film then it does a big blockbuster comic book franchise film this one,0.07695792
is very contained and very small then maybe like one exclusion in the whole thing,0.0894641
and that's not bad thing it's a very slowly paint film but it was beautiful,0.08830081
and there was space there for new arms and character development and emotional development fluid,0.05861075
this film is kind of like the last of us and always darkness an awesome,0.07657555
this one also looks amazing it's shot really well i loved how logan looks and,0.4033512
how old and beaten he loved he has a big beard and his face is,0.74462265
all my stuff and he's all scarred Professor X also looks like he has one,0.33921635
foot in the grave to the sooner this dark gritty mood that I really enjoyed,0.31089434
and it had this really nice serious tone throughout the song but it really fit,0.06649165
well with the story in a china shop the number one thing I liked about,0.094091624
Logan was the performances Hugh Jackman attractive stewards bring out the big guns for this,0.14947724
one but the steward plates an old and destroyed Professor Xavier he still has a,0.2856526
little bit of hook and trying to do the best he can for the mutants,0.46405014
but at the same time you can tell that life has really taken poor on,0.10277039
him it's not the professor x that we are used to an adoring to us,0.085549355
but it's also beautiful and engaging of course this film relies heavily on the performance,0.08721544
of the young girl who plays a young mutant Laura played by Jack McKean and,0.122496136
if she will be good in this film this one would have crashed and burned,0.45425972
however this girl is perfect this girl had two hits two things she has to,0.3346683
be engaging and not annoying and you got to like her and root for her,0.1547716
and at the things like she had to be amazing an action sequences and she,0.074658304
checked both boxes very well I loved watching her as X 23 she is monstrous,0.30172548
which is fighting she's an animal and see what the film without even having to,0.29990205
speak she gives such an amazing performance was just looking at people and her team,0.10140122
with hugh jackman is also just like a father's daughter master president thing happening and,0.11967004
it's the emotional core of the film but of course at the end of the,0.05003628
day this is Hugh Jackman film this is Wolverine show and huge ointment put in,0.27598572
his all in his performance of Wolverine this is a very unique thing for me,0.07919357
because I haven't watched a character to be played by the same actor for 17,0.06594022
years so to watch Hugh Jackman's grow from the younger green the receipt for the,0.066870466
first time in the first x-men to this old man Logan it's just so amazing,0.271024
it's captivating he plays Logan at the edge of his sanity the edge of his,0.15071057
collar and he's just so tired and you can tell that his heart has been,0.13508502
ripped to shreds and it's on his face it's in his eyes it's in the,0.46198118
way he walks and talks new Jackman really excelled in missile it's definitely his best,0.24191798
performance it's definitely for me that special Marie we've ever seen on screen I loved,0.1003186
it as always no movie it's perfect and now i'm going to talk about the,0.09451439
story things that i personally didn't like about Logan numbers the exposition I just don't,0.06894321
feel it the film handle exposition seen as well as i would have liked it,0.03137919
to a very specific example of that is when cell phone footage is used to,0.06220132
explain the background story of the young mutants and where she came from and a,0.15550704
lot of movies do this where they show you footage on a cell phone or,0.1486499
on a computer or on a USB and obviously edited to be a month ice,0.08681321
cream but it's filmed in a terrible way so it's in a cell phone that,0.093552396
doesn't happen in real life and what annoying is that there's a very easy solution,0.1930977
to this kind of thing where you can just open the phone and show us,0.075378
the disc multiple footage is and videos and the character can go through them and,0.07728135
then the montage happens in the film itself then we as an audience can understand,0.05618083
that this is part of the film not that it actually in the fourth edited,0.083145894
and ready to be viewed as a ready-made montage delivered to your doorstep again it's,0.086188816
a nitpick but when you happen in logan in an early cuz i self that,0.09945756
the film was better you were better than that Logan movies you're burned it the,0.24187179
number two thing i don't like about Logan was the character of cannabis not weekly,0.06399363
I didn't not like the character of Caliban the whole time I just hope that,0.044695526
sometimes we spent a little bit too much time with them specially somewhere down in,0.2077679
the middle of the film and it actually kind of slowed the film down I,0.0649769
would have rather stayed with Wolverine and with Professor X and with Laura rather than,0.07738158
spend so much time on Caliban wasn't really that necessary the number one thing I,0.0711836
didn't like about Logan is surprise surprise the villain so the suppose it means villain,0.14959139
in the film is the cycle Donald peers he has he's like a full metal,0.15417185
alchemist thing going on I mean he was okay and he pushes the plot forward,0.09770259
he leads the corporation that's trying to hunt them down I understand his presence from,0.2944536
a plus point of view but at the same time he didn't do much for,0.07938103
me was very forgettable and also trying to stay away from spoilers here but at,0.08087794
the same time they had certain tools and characters that popped up that I found,0.12001571
a little weird and didn't enjoy much the first time I saw the song the,0.086100765
second time I saw the film that character and that weapon worked a little bit,0.09058726
more for me and I kind of warmed up to it but clearly he wasn't,0.07814051
one of my favorite things so it's the least favorite thing i had about Logan,0.077114776
that's why I said number one so all in all Logan is an incredibly directed,0.14673762
written films and performed movie I love it it exceeded my expectations it was amazing,0.10472697
and it's the perfect send off to a beautiful character that I've been experiencing any,0.13272054
loving for the last 17 years he's totally gonna be invisible to I'm calling it,0.07809663
but a big giant salute to few judgment and his amazing run as this character,0.17107038
I'm so happy but if Silver's happen and I'm so happy that it does not,0.13528197
disappoint me and for that reason I'm going to give logan and 9 out of,0.21324693
10 so have you seen no gift you love it as much as I do,0.15113324
