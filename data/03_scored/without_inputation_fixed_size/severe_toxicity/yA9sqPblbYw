short pixar short called lava as we get to hear this wonderful hawaiian song and,0.06601349
we get to meet this volcano that is just full of love and full of,0.016669502
singing and this short had so much amazing beautiful textured animation i think this is,0.081389874
definitely one of the best pixar shorts i have ever seen i felt so much,0.04435245
emotion and i almost want to see a whole movie about what i just witnessed,0.03464742
it was just so magical and wonderful and beautiful and i really loved the song,0.020283446
what an amazing return for this great studio at least for this short i'll get,0.058925293
into my feelings of inside out in just a few seconds but i just really,0.14452645
want to focus just a little bit of energy right now and i'm almost done,0.033749424
about that beautiful short talk about in the comment box below what did you feel,0.060640138
about lava did it touch your heart it touched my soul and i actually clapped,0.24066223
afterwards i was one of me and my friend we clapped we were the only,0.063196436
ones in the studio clapping and i know this the animators weren't there nobody was,0.03277227
there to listen but i was just like wow thank you that was a amazing,0.021936426
short all right everyone let's talk about inside out this is the brand new animated,0.07020814
film two years of course we're getting more and more after this i'm a huge,0.033535898
fan of pixar i love their movies i think they're classics masterpiece great and good,0.03752168
yes you probably know what i'm talking about cars too i like it i don't,0.033261176
think i'll ever watch it again i'm not looking forward to cars 3 but for,0.03204988
me pixar's really never ever disappointed me they're one of the best animated studios if,0.049479686
not the best animated studios working today and maybe work forever i hope they i,0.06242416
just hope they live on and we get to see so many amazing stories and,0.02828228
if they make mistakes so what they know they're going to rise up above any,0.035343867
mistake they made and hopefully make something that is great and that's what i was,0.040395938
hoping for with this brand new film inside out of course we get to meet,0.06450685
a young little girl named riley we get to meet her parents but what's also,0.11752598
important about this film is that we get to peek into her mind we get,0.03062173
to meet anger and sadness and disgust and fear and joy and of course all,0.24908476
these little weird characters and emotions are played by people we all recognize there's no,0.027487384
need to mention them of course you know about them already you know all the,0.015837358
voices what is hopefully going to be important is that we're going to care about,0.019674137
the characters we're going to care about the journey that happens between of course the,0.01171987
humans and what is going on in their mind and that's the adventure we get,0.0505207
we get to peek into the mind of what's actually going on in our head,0.13011125
of course we get to see this through this little innocent little girl that's going,0.18677425
to her first day of school because she's just moved well she's experienced school before,0.06995404
but of course it's a new area because she lived in minnesota with their family,0.0622858
and for some reason they've moved to san francisco though i don't know if that,0.035572026
ever is made clear but that's okay uh that's okay not not no no issues,0.054284308
right there but the movie kind of flashes back and forth as we get to,0.019175915
see her and her struggles something weird is happening thanks to the emotions in her,0.040415227
mind and the journey that they go on to to hopefully bring her back home,0.030685587
and bring her back to who riley is the person that she is uh emotions,0.11840668
and feelings and joy and happiness and fear and anger and all those things that,0.05208521
we all deal with on a daily basis but we never really i don't know,0.04669589
if we ever had a fun and entertaining insightful look into our own minds like,0.044311874
this movie presented i had emotions i don't know if i ever felt disgust i,0.23428825
never really felt disgust while i was watching this movie i never really felt anger,0.21736538
while watching this feeling but i did feel sadness joy and fear i'll get into,0.04354292
fear first because fear maybe can be some of my nitpicking complaints that i'm not,0.036462042
going to go in grand detail because i don't want to spoil anything but i,0.045263752
do want to mention my favorite character in this film is bing bong see the,0.030255213
film you'll see bing bong is my favorite character i love all the other people,0.06560507
but bing bong i can't wait to own i know they're gonna that thing's gonna,0.09750262
sell like hot cakes people are gonna have bing bongs i'm gonna have a bing,0.10605355
bong i haven't had a i haven't had a stuffed animal forever i want to,0.10400612
get a bing bong so see the film then you'll know where am i at,0.052447736
okay um so yes i had a little bit of fear watching this movie at,0.07237398
times because we're enjoying uh this whole journey of going back and forth but sometimes,0.010370213
i was like where is this film going i mean there's so much animation in,0.033485346
this movie that i'm trying to control myself because i'm like wait what's going on,0.091627054
over here what's happening over here am i having any emotional connection to all the,0.01666551
crazy insane things that are popping up and peering into the minds of what's going,0.21199004
on in this little girl's mind and how she's dealing with certain things and how,0.18084347
this world might be coming down to an end because she's feeling so much anxiety,0.13283917
and it's just i just yeah so i i have to admit there were times,0.044050455
in the film where i felt a little fear like i didn't know what to,0.049663275
make of what was going on but i really cared about the characters specifically of,0.016008975
course sadness and joy because we go on this journey with those two characters and,0.02510004
everybody gets a chance to shine in this movie of course the voice work is,0.02344706
amazing i liked the human characters i liked the emotional characters i liked all the,0.033424146
little surprises that we got to go as we get really into the mind of,0.03060909
this character i mean of riley and we get to peek into what she's passionate,0.055220887
about what she cares about and that's where the joy and the sadness kicked in,0.15655562
pixar is so good and this is you know of course pete doctor the director,0.04567816
of up and monsters inc of course probably some of the best animated films ever,0.08450759
made just especially up up is one of my favorites of all time and every,0.024905806
time i hear that oscar winning score i cry i cry i feel sadness and,0.07720122
joy uh i just i loved the insight that this movie explored yes it's a,0.05626988
family movie it's animation and stuff like that and kids will enjoy all the colors,0.12636293
and and the characters and the bumbling things bing bong yeah they're gonna i think,0.07568526
they're just gonna eat up bing bong bing bong's like hero okay um but i,0.080290996
think the adults will appreciate it too maybe on a nostalgic level of just like,0.03054856
remembering the memories you had when you were a kid yes this movie focuses on,0.040799703
a little girl but i think anybody who has a heart and a soul can,0.20735636
connect to this story that's what makes this movie so magical and i do like,0.026096486
that it appears into the minds for a little bit of the parents and see,0.026926635
what's going on and how it's kind of shaped their lives and how you know,0.15583523
they're kind of set in their ways but when you're a kid it's kind of,0.04681629
weird when you're a kid i guess according to this film joy and sadness are,0.0548557
like feminine qualities also discussed according to this film at least and then anger and,0.09988331
fear are kind of more male qualities at least according to this film so that'd,0.1113238
be cool true because i think i grabbed some of my joy and sadness from,0.06291174
my mom and a little bit of my anger from my dad so yeah that's,0.16700633
yeah interesting you know just in sight that's what i appreciate this movie so much,0.042810556
why i appreciate this movement so much is the insight into the into the mind,0.06858575
the human and how it works and how memories work uh i think after watching,0.06943852
this film as a society we're definitely going to every time we have a thought,0.034844317
or something go on our mind whether it's something that's important to happen to us,0.029616637
or just a stupid song or commercial that's stuck in our head we are going,0.5128477
to think about inside out and that's what's so great about this film what's so,0.063245
magical about uh the message of this movie and this is a film of course,0.031290237
and probably a lot of people repeating a lot of people what people said this,0.041020546
is a film that is definitely going to put pixar on the map again we're,0.027208006
never going to forget pixar yes they've made some mistakes but this is definitely a,0.019463273
prime example of why pixar animation studios is the best they can bring out so,0.04054627
much emotion and give us so many memorable characters and then on top of that,0.01595443
some of the best animation you're ever going to see i could talk about this,0.04880053
movie for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours this is uh i,0.06547469
predict right now i i do predict that this film will win the oscar for,0.033313062
