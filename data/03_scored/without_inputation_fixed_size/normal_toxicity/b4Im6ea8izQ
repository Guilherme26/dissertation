in this movie played by an actress that I once again can't remember her name,0.08279193
really a lot of people in this movie kicked ass and I think that the,0.9284855
action sequences in general were filmed better CGI was better during these action cygnus movie,0.101028845
is definitely going for it in terms of the humor it takes everything that you,0.06077856
thought you knew about Thor from the previous movies and it tries to apply a,0.025315633
more comedic touch to it for me that personally has some mixed results but overall,0.10150274
I can't deny there were definitely a few scenes in this movie where I was,0.056836832
laughing my ass off in particular some of the interactions between Loki and Thor I,0.7417671
mean those guys have always had great chemistry those guys have always been those great,0.10074431
Shakespearean brothers with a lot of great stuff between them both emotionally and from a,0.16304111

off to get younger I'm saying that somehow she has mastered the art of being,0.109862775
younger by possibly draining the life force from other people but I was so conflicted,0.15500405
walking out of this movie because listen I'm not a huge Thor fan but I,0.095106475

material to the media that is being portrayed in I try to separate it I,0.066703975
try to go you know what artistic freedom they can take license they can change,0.102121554

the thor ragnarok comic the one that i love the one that I read this,0.1176534
movie doesn't really feel like thor ragnarok and that's probably the biggest criticism that I,0.062921636
can have a movie called thor ragnarok is that it doesn't really feel like thor,0.07231875
ragnarok how the tension and the stakes aren't really there and when they are there,0.06543441
the movie in my opinion compromises the tension and the stakes and the elevated gravity,0.05548912
of the situation by throwing in another joke I mean I'm pretty sure this movie,0.1471957
can't go like two or three minutes without shoving another joke down your throat get,0.41912565

of the movie is trying to be an apocalyptic end of days for Asgardians it's,0.1272166
supposed to be this big epic thing and the other part of the movie is,0.11259072

joke being thrown at you there was you know really cool 80s music playing while,0.23959646

don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this has been called the most hilarious,0.1654358
Marvel movie ever for me I laughed a few times but I really don't think,0.14944477
the movie is as funny as other people made it out to be but again,0.109254465
humor is a subjective thing that could just be me then there are some other,0.02285222
instances in this movie of lazy storytelling where I feel like there are characters from,0.1666655
previous films who are either in this movie or not in this movie and their,0.10604379
absence or lack thereof is kind of unexplained in a way there are things that,0.064777635

story elements not just for previous movies but from this movie that could have used,0.03590758
a little bit more attention but instead they sacrificed that to tell another joke I,0.1536965
want to make it seem like I'm bitching about thor ragnarok I mean the movie,0.45176208
again is entertaining and if that's all you wanted if that's all you're going into,0.086762615
this movie for mission accomplished the movie has entertained I feel like the flaws of,0.06562679
the movie in this case kind of way with the positives because for every moment,0.090907946
in this movie that I liked or I smile is another moment in this movie,0.09266564
that I rolled my eyes at or I hate it and so I can't really,0.31089434
in good conscience say that this movie is anything better than average much as it,0.10350625
pains me to say this store Ragnarok while entertaining is an average movie right in,0.22228055
