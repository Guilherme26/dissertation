hi everyone and welcome back to roll the credit my name is Hana and this,0.04739545
is a channel for everyone who's interested in film TV and pop culture today we,0.07466348
are gonna be talking about a play that is currently running at the null coward,0.61483055
theater in London and it is all about Eve starring Julie Madison and Lily James,0.048462193
in the main roles I saw this performance about two weeks ago now for my,0.05822064
birthday and I was actually quite surprised how good it was and I'm someone who,0.09284372
doesn't really go to the theater a lot but I love love love Gillian Anderson,0.10327008
so it was a guaranteed success for me and I'm just really happy that it,0.04850371
didn't disappoint me because sometimes when you have a favorite actress or after a director,0.11531595
and you watch something that's a little bit different to what you've seen them in,0.10579129
before sometimes you do end up getting a little bit disappointed but Gillian Anderson is,0.13452546
a master at theater she is absolutely stunning when she's on stage and doing her,0.25445455
thing I have previously seen her in streetcar named desire but I saw their like,0.08322559
national theater and live performance and not actually saw it in the theater and she,0.108715065
is amazing so we're gonna talk a little bit about Gillian understood and her amazingness,0.18762104
and also discussing obviously the entire play and the ensemble and just the scenography and,0.10252758
everything about All About Eve before I get going to that if you do enjoy,0.048745707
this video and you want to see more of my reviews and live reactions to,0.12507394
watching TV series of films for the first time then make sure that you hit,0.16041364
the subscribe button down below and if you do enjoy this video make sure you,0.20914127
give it a thumbs up so yeah let's get into discussing all of my Eve,0.084312126
so I can't wait into this play and performance only knowing that it was about,0.07356729
this woman and her understudy that was all I knew and that is pretty much,0.37271324
what the play is about so it is called All About Eve and Eve is,0.030668769
played by Lily James and she he comes into the life of Margo I can't,0.08131262
remember her last name Margo Channing she comes into life on Margo Channing who is,0.11322518
a Broadway star and a sensation she comes in to her life after one of,0.07965146
her performances Eve has been standing at the stage door and has been to every,0.12939678
single performance that Margo has done and she starts telling her the story about her,0.07385235
life on how she aspires to be Margo and it just it kind of takes,0.19387348
on from there Margaret kind of takes eat under her wing and lets her come,0.18180642
into her home she stays in her house and comes to the theatre with her,0.096997134
to work there and eventually she becomes Margo's understudy so in the beginning you kind,0.11180251
of just feel that okay Eve is a huge fan of Margo and she just,0.087143555
aspires to be a good as good of an actress that Margo is the further,0.09937353
along in the play get the weirder it starts getting Michael has a boyfriend who,0.08260414
is a lot younger than her and Margo is actually in her like prime years,0.05908271
so she is getting a little bit too old or she feels that she's getting,0.37140414
too old in her world or in her like in her career and uh seeing,0.18085705
Eve coming up and kind of flirting with her boyfriend she does get a very,0.24680191
very insecure and when her boyfriend comes back from a gasps la they throw a,0.31089434
big birthday slash welcome home party for him and it's just a very odd situation,0.14593916
because they have all these friends and family over but Margo just doesn't really spend,0.060388062
time with him she gets meeting any junk and she doesn't like the life that,0.69542736
has become of her since Eve entered her life and I think that is pretty,0.15698585
much the main trigger for her look since Eve came in and started becoming like,0.13460091
more and more attached to her and starting to take a bigger role in her,0.10432961
life or in the lives of the people around Margo she starts feeling very very,0.1523886
insecure and eventually just spirals and she doesn't really trust anyone and she sees how,0.207839
Eve just takes and takes and takes more of what is Margo's life and she,0.07650845
starts to and doubt the people around her and also doubt herself in who she,0.103995785
is now I'm terrible I remember things that happened while I watched them so that,0.0756592
is pretty much the like rundown of the story all about each is based on,0.08382863
the film that was all about Eve back in the day I think it's like,0.052864574
from the 60s we're gonna read a little quickly from Wikipedia yeah so let you,0.073350325
it is pretty much what I said Margo Channing is a highly regarded but aging,0.08513261
Broadway star and Eve Harrington is an ambitious young fan who insinuates herself into Channing's,0.05943749
life ultimately threatening Chinese career and her personal relationship and I just felt that I,0.23980723
don't want to give anything away from people who haven't like watched the previous film,0.10348709
or read the script or anything like I don't want to spoil the ending but,0.06420334
such a good ending I just thought it was like the perfect theater ending in,0.17454904
a way because I don't really like with theater ends and like a happy like,0.0840751
a happy ending you usually doesn't it is usually like it leaves you sat there,0.14285484
and received with something to think about and this play definitely definitely definitely leaves you,0.071444154
tons to think about before I get into my praise for Gillian Anderson I just,0.17213939
want to talk about the scenography and the production design of this because it was,0.06515623
a little bit different from any other theatre performance I've ever seen I think the,0.08379597
only other play or like adoption of a play I've ever seen I was very,0.03398703
different was 1984 that I saw in Cardiff once and I just having read the,0.062486075
book and seen the film seeing it on stage was just such a contrast and,0.037336428
it was a very minimalistic performance in that way and and all about II was,0.07010039
very interestingly like placed so so the stage looks pretty much like a room we,0.090187564
open up and it's an empty room it's got three walls so obviously we are,0.089060016
the fourth wall as always and eventually once the first opening like monologue is finished,0.085964456
all the walls come up and we get to see there's a door at the,0.06898046
end and on the Left there's something that looks like and there's a door there,0.118710384
too and then there's a door on the right side the walls hug dog come,0.15043151
up now become video screens which I thought was very very interesting and it took,0.07437927
me a little while to understand what was happening because I was very confused essentially,0.081371635
the video screams allows the audience to see what is happening in other parts of,0.11606428
the play the main stage is either her dressing room or her apartment and by,0.070027806
her I mean Margo's in the back is the bathroom and on the left is,0.1550224
a kitchen slash like entryway so during the big party when her boyfriend comes home,0.24119665
there's a lot of action going on in the kitchen so everyone's hanging out in,0.24198851
the kitchen drinking while all the action is happening on the main stage but then,0.10515937
there's also action happening in the bathroom there's a scene that I completely missed which,0.061062075
are very excited to see when I go back to watching it for closing night,0.10699112
but literally the entire cast is on the main stage and for some reason everyone,0.06441798
was laughing I couldn't figure out what everyone was laughing but in on the big,0.0708275
screen we see Margo in the bathtub she is wasted out of her mind and,0.31089434
on the big screens they show Margo in the back in the bathroom like falling,0.14194442
into the bathtub doctors added another dimension to what is usually seen in a theater,0.07877504
and I just thought that was quite a clever way of allowing the stage to,0.09822128
be extended in that way and also incorporating a little bit more video they also,0.12962368
used it in a fantastic way by by putting a camera in the mirror that,0.1275957
she has in her dressing room so when she's like looking at herself and being,0.15125334
like oh my god I'm old blown up on a big screen on the stage,0.16239601
and we get to see like up close and personal with her and then just,0.11070997
like it adds a little bit more dimension to a stage play and I thought,0.08757173
that was quite clever yeah I thought that was quite a clever way and a,0.10285061
nice touch as someone who very very very infrequently visits the theatre I also liked,0.1043438
this set design and how it was all one color so the bed and the,0.2523544
sofa and carpet and the walls they were all the same shade of like a,0.14629228
dark pinkish burning me color I just like when it's simplistic I like when they,0.43579125
don't try to add too much and like just lets the story tell itself but,0.044527374
I also liked how it opened up to everything that was backstage that that also,0.080346376
like the backstage area was a character of itself and that just really interests me,0.0680234
a lot if we go into the acting it was just like an all-around stellar,0.08131138
cast I don't think that anyone really disappointed me I am gonna talk a little,0.11256954
bit ma'am I am gonna talk a little bit about Lilly James I'm probably not,0.09891296
her biggest fan and I haven't really seen her in a bunch I'm literally just,0.18208876
seen her in Mamma Mia I wasn't the biggest fan of her performance in this,0.091440395
show I just felt that she was kind of bland but it could just be,0.32979503
that her character's not very interesting even though the play is called All About Eve,0.07763415
it's literally all about Margo and I don't know maybe that is like if without,0.08300171
giving away the ending maybe Margo was the same person Eve was what she was,0.10879379
young and she went to the theater and she saw this big star and then,0.07656288
she became her understudy and kind of took over her life I don't know maybe,0.18871145
that is what that is maybe why it's called All About Eve but it's literally,0.049932938
not All About Eve and I'm quite happy that Margo has the biggest role and,0.050354194
that Julie Anderson actually gets to like thrive in her role as Margo Channing because,0.11973129
it's just like it's such a stunning role and Gillian Anderson is as I said,0.15862614
amazing in this role and I'm so happy that she took on this task I,0.074292704
am very excited to go back to the null character and see it on closing,0.22981007
night because it is possibly one of the best plays I've ever seen and I,0.046888176
haven't seen a lot and it isn't just because Jillian Addison's fantastic in it the,0.038552936
entire cast is fantastic writing is very witty and I loved the stage setup even,0.08628131
though in the beginning I was very confused and kind of didn't like it it,0.05709345
was fantastic now that I think about a little bit more Eva Von Hoff just,0.09930842
like did a really good job in directing the ensemble like everyone had something to,0.101350084
do with all times and the people in the back while things were happening mainstage,0.07552996
the people are in the kitchen they were going full out and it was really,0.15544482
very impressive just to see like it created the life of a party even though,0.099157326
the party was in the back room and on the main room the party wasn't,0.0715945
really there it just added so much dimension to the play I also kind of,0.023850307
joy when they do break the fourth wall and they do break the fourth wall,0.15466651
quite a couple of times in this play there is a lot of talking to,0.05627003
the audience but it's more like the audience of the theater that they're doing I,0.03329351
can't remember which character or what significance her KarenT has I think she's like Margo's,0.13916329
manager or something like that and or the producer she talks directly to the audience,0.08765574
kind of updating us on what's going on and what's happening it kind of like,0.054724056
Annie's way in in a sense and I did quite enjoy that I do enjoy,0.06291622
when they break the fourth wall and through that making the audience feel like they,0.06746394
are the audience like they're just spectators they're not part of the play they're just,0.06092039
spectators and but still being able to address the audience in that way if that,0.045499958
makes any sense I don't even know I said but I think that made sense,0.09950252
anyway yeah Judy Madsen is fantastic she was just nominated for an over here all,0.19448122
olivia.olivia award I can say that so I'm very excited to see that all of,0.06816036
you your oliviere awards I'm definitely not a theater person as you can tell so,0.4222396
I'm very excited to see that and I have my fingers crossed for Jillian Addison,0.08890823
because she is stunning and as much as I love everything that she does I,0.15589866
want her to do more theater stuff and also more comedies so imagine her doing,0.24093997
a comedy play that would just be amazing so that is my review and my,0.1011359
thoughts about Oliver Eve that you can catch at the mill coward theater right here,0.5593826
in London so make sure you go see that I think it ends on the,0.09212833
11th of May I could not be more excited to see it again because it,0.10499223
