finally discuss the one that a lot of people were very very positive about and,0.026272094
that is the Joseph mankiewicz film from 1950 also the Best Picture winner of 1950,0.0121702
All About Eve starring the greats Betty Davis and Baxter and Marilyn Monroe so I,0.0151429055
really didn't know what this movie was about but it definitely was a movie that,0.0152333705
I had always heard of anything by name and the fact that it also starred,0.018624477
the great Betty Davis but one of the few things that I always thought about,0.019645534
in regards to this film was the fact that Betty Davis was the character of,0.015971724
Eve and to my surprise she wasn't she was a character named Margo Channing and,0.051241092
Eve was played by Anne Baxter so that was definitely an interesting twist for me,0.018198093
also knowing that this was directed by Joseph mankiewicz and last year reviewing his film,0.05822685
Cleopatra I definitely was very curious as to how I was going to feel when,0.023109145
I watched this movie so this is the story of a young woman named Eve,0.06247937
this simple woman who is just head over heels over this Broadway actress named Margo,0.21966226
Channing and all she wants is to meet her and possibly be a part of,0.03412259
her life and after getting an opportunity thanks to the writer of a lot of,0.0376321
plays that Margo was a part of his wife Karen played by Celeste Holm Margo,0.046732478
really takes a liking to Eve and asks her to be one of her personal,0.04103784
assistants and as time moves on it turns out that this innocent hopeful woman with,0.10796729
big dreams in her eyes was not the woman as she claimed to Margeaux already,0.3124117
had her suspicions about Eve pretty much from the get-go when after a few weeks,0.065548524
had passed and she realizes that while she may be idolizing her she may be,0.10899034
a little bit more towards obsession but it turns out that Eve has not only,0.04366465
powerful feelings towards Margo in terms of her star power she actually wants to use,0.031789128
this aging Broadway star to bring her own personal career to new heights and in,0.023409143
the world of theater one of the ways to do so is to step on,0.04617173
as many toes as you can and play people to actually make sure that you,0.056967657
get to where you want you literally have to act offstage as well as on,0.061703764
stage and through this process who of course gets involved well the journalists get involved,0.020135773
particularly a man named Addison DeWitt who is probably known for digging up the most,0.07120725
dirt on celebrities as he possibly can and what he discovers who this Eve is,0.1603372
and what she's all about he takes her under his personal wing and through that,0.087178305
Eve truly feels that she's gonna get even bigger and better and finally surpass Margo,0.05880423
as the new fresh face of Broadway until she realizes that even she with the,0.028841032
ambitions that she has can be played as well I will say with no expectations,0.071674205
about this film whatsoever this was one of the most interesting and powerful and overall,0.038823444
excitingly dramatic films that I have seen in a long while especially through the Golden,0.070125654
Age of Hollywood this movie with the accolades that it received at the Oscars as,0.022475226
well as being known as one of the greatest films of all time I see,0.038690407
it it is one of the most powerful and beautifully acted films that I have,0.034244318
ever seen I loved all of the acting in this film I was so entranced,0.07621674
by this story even with a movie over two hours long the hours just flew,0.024494722
by while I was watching it one of the other things that I really appreciate,0.02583041
about this film is especially when you take a look at today's world in film,0.041318547
how the leftist loonies are constantly yelling about the fact that women don't have powerful,0.35664618
representation in films did you not see All About Eve because the male characters in,0.030015081
this film are barely significant compared to the powerhouses that the female actors are in,0.0803901
this film we got an baxter and betty davis in their primes and they gave,0.18857823
us oscar-worthy performances for which they did in fact win the last home playing Karen,0.02910644
Richards also playing such an incredible performance as the writers wife as well as Marilyn,0.03109933
Monroe who has such a small role in this movie with her being on screen,0.11087015
every minute she just shines throws out great lines and even though she's only in,0.054343507
the film I think for a general amount of maybe five minutes she makes her,0.05899647
landmark in this movie as a whole is regards to one of her better performances,0.040759128
and I love that but without a doubt the dynamic characters the ever-changing layers of,0.024970993
each of them is just absolutely incredible I mean Betty Davis is one of the,0.0255517
legends her famous line fasten your seat belts it's going to be a bumpy night,0.17025508
speaks volumes in regards to what this movie is about and Baxter as Eve is,0.019288996
such an incredible character and it's not just the character evolving in the story but,0.00441948
it's the way that she looks at the camera looks at the characters the way,0.039287742
she looks like an innocent person in the beginning to an evil diva at the,0.2828224
end is just absolutely incredible I think that that was one of the most amazing,0.035341874
and worthy performances that I have ever seen from any actor it just gave me,0.028767861
goosebumps while I watched her change on screen and I just loved how at the,0.05024132
end of the day with this character being who she was the fact that what,0.041562006
happens to her and the end is something audience wanted to see happen because you,0.04468105
would think that Betty Davis was going to be the real crazed diva of the,0.09638644
film but it's incredible how she ended up being the victim at the end of,0.045615632
the day to a degree because of Eve's intentions I can't recommend this movie enough,0.05671356
even if you have never seen a black-and-white movie before even if you're not interested,0.1011425
in any movies that were made before 1980 I still cannot praise all about Eve,0.027227962
enough this is one of the best films that I have ever seen in my,0.0589672
life it is a movie that I would gladly see again and yes it's even,0.0548404
a movie that I would consider getting on DVD but I haven't reached that conclusion,0.03190886
just yet but it is definitely what everyone says it's supposed to be it is,0.013519858
such an incredible film for what it is for its time and it definitely pushed,0.023820227
so many boundaries in terms of roles for women I cannot praise all about Eve,0.056861892
