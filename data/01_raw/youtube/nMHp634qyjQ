hi this is Amy and I'm a librarian here at the Warren newport public library and I'm going to be talking about Mad Max fury road this is a remake of the original Mad Max starring mel gibson um he if you're familiar with that story it's basically the same thing just with an update of characters it is rated R it is very violent they have some disturbing images but if you enjoyed the original Mad Max you would really like this one high energy high voltage a lot of things blowing up but it is a dystopia and so there's a lot of bleak scenes and things like that so if you liked mad max if you like that series you're going to love this movie
