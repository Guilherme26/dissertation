yeah sorry man get out yo I really do not want to spoil this movie,0.22650006
i'ma try my best to not give away too much but y'all know I had,0.13144325
to do a review on this movie I went and saw get out which is,0.081594005
a movie written and directed by Jordan Peele and if you guys are familiar with,0.07950166
who he is he's an actor and comedian he's most known for his show key,0.124404624
and Peele which is like funny is oh now after seeing this movie twice I,0.09770738
saw once with a group of people and I went to see it again by,0.124439575
myself I just knew that I was gonna have to come on here and talk,0.103513986
to you guys about this movie when I first saw the preview of this movie,0.08712164
I was super skeptical one because I mean it was a black guy he loved,0.5152983
black people are in scary movies and definitely not the lead and when they are,0.7093121
you know they in like two seconds and I was also skeptical because it said,0.08689776
from the mind of Jordan Peele who's known for you know for comedy I saw,0.1034707
that cat movie and if I mean it was funny but it was just like,0.08267684
pure ridiculousness so I was really curious about how he was gonna jump from comedy,0.7557441
into into like suspense thriller horror and for anyone who knows me like I love,0.31711596
scary movies like horror thriller suspense is my favorite genre of movies so I didn't,0.10444175
really I didn't really see the connection between him and this genre movies but I,0.05992986
went to go and see it anyways I'm gonna start by saying that this movie,0.06725872
was both hilarious and terrifying and it was a hilarious in the sense that I,0.15201385
felt like I was watching a comedy there was just a bit more comic relief,0.12548906
than your average horror flick and it wasn't terrifying in that it was scary it,0.31089434
was just there were parts that make you jump and this movie just made you,0.0947734
feel so uneasy like I was in that theater stressed out like I was on,0.10911335
the edge of my seat the whole time this just the emotions this movie brought,0.09978729
out of me was just befuddling is funneling a word but fettle funnily whatever but,0.117865905
it is very clear that this movie is meant to be a thriller and not,0.102276176
a comedy and honestly how this movie got made and passed through Hollywood I have,0.09047771
no idea but I'm gonna break it down for you guys and tell you what,0.2405713
I liked about it and what I didn't like now the first thing that I,0.09481133
liked about the movie is that it opened up playing redbone by childish gambino like,0.18126199
I love that song but the reason why I feel like this is important isn't,0.050799876
just because like Oh much movie with song at like no there's a lot of,0.076719254
movies with music I like this song and this album in particular like it really,0.101929255
gives you the feel of blackness that sounds probably really weird for me to say,0.46615016
it sets the tone and it sets the vibe the only reason I'm saying this,0.14029133
is important is because the way he interacted with the other black Pete I'm try,0.31089434
not to give away too much but the way he interacted with the other black,0.48535794
people in the movie like it just gives you a certain feeling and when you,0.1460662
watch this movie you'll know what I mean I also liked the imagery the cinematography,0.20158862
it was very well shot the shot angles the color palettes was really really good,0.55969256
um the way it was filmed it was there was a lot of like symbolic,0.06291599
shots within the movie a lot of nods to like older horror flicks which I,0.27660003
thought was really really cool the performances were really really good especially Chris the main,0.0668823
character and his real name is Daniel a poop I don't know I'm sorry sorry,0.5876557
his performance was really really good like he really captured the feeling that I feel,0.08157073
like most people especially the black audiences I have to keep going back to black,0.60860926
people but me with this move you kind of have to but he really captured,0.07700776
the same feeling that we were feeling there were times in the movie where I,0.04894485
was like this is crazy I think he would literally be like this is crazy,0.44583985
you feel me so he really captured the feel of how I feel like most,0.099285856
people would react if they were in that situation the best thing about this movie,0.08998264
is the plot it is the writing like Jordan Peele nailed the out of this,0.16301192
movie like he did such a good job the way he wrote this in the,0.104942136
way he went about it was very very special like I'm gonna go I'm gonna,0.10452711
go into that a little bit later but the reason why I'm putting emphases on,0.22837692
the writing when you watch scary movies if you're someone who genuinely loves scary movies,0.19157031
you know that scary movies for the past like decade have been asked for the,0.15247953
most part that's partially because the writing is so trash they think if a nut,0.72658384
stuff pops out at you and there's enough creepy sounds and the actors can look,0.31413546
scared enough that it's a scary movie and a lot of people buy into that,0.15495905
that like Paranormal Activity cameras moving doors shut that is it's not scary the only,0.35353482
good scary movie I've seen recently that like automatically pops up off the top of,0.080451265
my head is insidious and ironically the producers from insidious were on this movie to,0.12744115
the fact that the plot was so enticing is what helps make a scary movie,0.08555189
scary or at least entertaining running away from the deal with a knife and door,0.1865029
shutting by itself is not scary the fact that you got comedians out here making,0.23277514
better scary movies than scary movie people yeah study game up now the next thing,0.14896476
that I absolutely loved was low-res character Laura as a comedian his name in the,0.09192807
movie was rot and what I loved about his character was he gave a voice,0.32429877
to every black person who's ever watched a scary movie literally everything he was saying,0.74518466
in the movie is what we say when we watch scary movies and it was,0.08840686
just refreshing to actually see a voice of reason in a scary movie scene on,0.1492959
scary movies everybody are like they're all idiots and it's probably why black people are,0.9482643
never in scary movies or they kill us in like the first two minutes because,0.35815656
we don't put ourselves in these situation we don't chase demons with video cameras if,0.15606698
we hear a creepy noise we don't investigate we don't buy dolls from the 1800s,0.09489458
we don't do that let's split a bullet and if we're running we don't fall,0.27797985
now what I didn't like about this movie was I honestly can't think of anything,0.12098056
I dislike about this movie I'm not saying it's the perfect film or whatever but,0.11362127
I really don't have any complaints like I think this movie was really well done,0.097967826
there are some things that were in the trailer and on the movie poster that,0.040679153
weren't in the actual movie or that didn't quite like connect in the trailer there,0.043849427
was like this deer skeleton thing like 1 rawr or whatever and you didn't see,0.103748076
that in the movie also on the movie poster there's like a guy in like,0.11125174
an old Knights helmet and there's a point in the movie where you see that,0.053524055
same helmet inside of the car it didn't really make that much sense but at,0.048809618
the same time it wasn't relevant enough that it leaves you really baffled or confused,0.07044319
if you don't understand this movie is not going to be because of that one,0.12677911
3 second clip in the trailer or that quick glance at that little Knight thinking,0.12021886
so it's not like a huge deal but you really don't want to see stuff,0.16206245
in the trailer that's not actually in the movie itself now something I find very,0.05070735
annoying and it isn't even with the movie itself is with the people who like,0.18813868
review this movie or review the trailer or just making commentary about it saying that,0.057167422
this movie is race baiting and all that other stuff and it's racist and it's,0.4706414
just there's a difference between race baiting and calling out racism like that those two,0.37988812
things are not synonymous like if you need clarification this movie was a psychological thriller,0.11143989
that used horror and suspense to point out how racism still exists in a society,0.3363377
that people are claiming as post-racial part of this movies intent was to show passive,0.31089434
racism as opposed to blatant racism a lot of us who are sitting here saying,0.37082377
that racism still exists and you guys are arguing it with us because the KKK,0.33339426
isn't ever I mean they are around but because people aren't getting lynched they aren't,0.29479873
getting which and this is why I think what he did was very unique and,0.06547499
special because the way Jordan Peele chose to point out racism was very clever and,0.35517457
it wasn't clever in a way that he was trying to be sneaky about it,0.31089434
he chose to point out passive racism as opposed to blatant racism because when we,0.31089434
see movies nowadays where racism is involved it's very Leyton it's very in-your-face and that's,0.32777935
because in most cases movies with black people in it especially what a black lead,0.4863299
is about slavery or it's about the civil rights era it's black people trying to,0.5729828
overcome some huge thing because of their blackness even though that still exists that's not,0.3405675
our everyday blame racism for the most part is not our everyday we deal with,0.2851404
a lot of passive races of a lot of under-the-table systematic very coded language that's,0.15308528
the type of racism we deal with on a day-to-day unless biro most of us,0.45582524
would be a little taken aback as someone randomly on the street jumped into our,0.13998652
face and caught us a like twenty thirty years ago that was the norm and,0.053188592
back then black people most of them wouldn't even think of reacting to the way,0.73581773
that we react to blatant racism now and what was so clever and accurate about,0.35405296
it is the way that he wrote the white characters and let's be real if,0.1696409
you watch King pill they know how to write like people but he didn't write,0.22085273
them as blatant racist like you know before I'm not even gonna get into the,0.72972685
plot twist they weren't malicious they didn't like imply black people were inferior to white,0.76902086
people they weren't saying I don't want this black guy in my house or dating,0.69029844
my daughter if anything they were just really ignorant you know they kept saying that,0.6111372
black people have special capabilities and their genetic makeup makes them better at this and,0.6048068
that they were just saying a lot of ignorant they were doing what a lot,0.70482284
of white people do to black people they always try to connect with us on,0.5154597
a black level before they try to connect with us as just regular human beings,0.57459533
and sometimes it just goes too far and so that's why a lot of people,0.08408571
get so sensitive when we talk about racism because they think we're automatically calling them,0.24055503
a KKK member or Hitler or think that they're trying to exterminate the black population,0.77491415
like no you're you're just a little ignorant like that it's all we're saying just,0.81209475
pull it back a little bit so when we say this movie is about race,0.17765558
and racism is not about it in the same way that we're used to seeing,0.23843859
it on TV and in movies there's certain things that were set in a moving,0.0735996
you're just like like aha like I don't want to give too much away but,0.4024401
there's like a point where he says it's a privilege to be able to experience,0.08612021
another person's culture when ironically okay I don't want to spoil it I don't wanna,0.17034587
give nothing wait there's another part where there's a party full of white people and,0.475876
the white guy says to Chris black isn't style you know what I'm saying he's,0.5876557
like black is what's poppin right now that's not what he said but he said,0.34698513
black is him style attack at the extra puppet um there's another point in the,0.6050045
movie where Chris the main guy the black guy says why black people in the,0.6364068
guy responds it's a white guy and he's blind so I mean he doesn't know,0.605005
Chris is black unless someone tells him he's black so it's not like Pele was,0.5974093
trying to portray white people as the white devil who are trying to single out,0.7093121
black people I mean in a sense they were but again plot twist but anyway,0.61338145
to wrap this up I really really enjoyed this movie I honestly might do a,0.086523265
second video to kind of explain the actual movie because this movie was super intricate,0.13779552
there were so many layers to it and when reading comments and speaking to people,0.060133997
about it there was a lot of stuff that they didn't understand a lot of,0.06948999
metaphors they didn't understand that like really popped out to me so I kind of,0.09377888
want to like open up the discussion to talk about it um but that'll be,0.044524558
for a later time but I'm just gonna say I genuinely enjoyed this movie I,0.06400925
would encourage everyone to go and watch it and I would rate this I never,0.0910129
know if it's supposed to be rating out of five or out of ten well,0.092755534
