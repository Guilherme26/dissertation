so Guillermo del Toro directed Hellboy Hellboy has obtained the amphibian creature in this movie looks like a bian is directed by Guillermo del Toro and played by the same actor who played Abe Sapien in Hellboy which Guillermo del Toro also directed but this is not an Abe Sapien prequel spin-off or movie at all cool the shape of water so the shape of water is ultimately a sweet movie and a violent movie directed by Guillermo del Toro his lady works in this government facility in the 1960s its amidst the Cold War her and her friend played by Octavia Spencer there the janitors they just clean up the mess around there but this government facility led by Michael Shannon has brought in a creature that's ultimately like Creature from the Black Lagoon it's easy to see this thing as a monster they see the thing as a monster they see the thing as a way to beat the Russians into space but our star of the movie played by Sally Hawkins develops a connection with this creature and after that it kind of becomes like et but with a creature that's underwater what I like about this movie is the performances are oh great the movie looks fantastic Guillermo del Toro always kills it on that Michael Shannon is really menacing as the main agent in this movie he's one of those ones when he is on screen and he is in a room he's the one you're paying attention to no one upstages Michael Shannon ever those movies included Sally Hawkins in this movie plays a bit of a loner bit of an introvert and she also is a mute she never talks in the movie and I take that for granted a lot of the time it's easy to think to yourself with the way people convey the thoughts feelings and emotions is through voice but it's completely not like that that's one element and angle of communication but this Nala we have so what a character like this comes along and completely conveys any and all of her thoughts feelings and emotions at any given time it's really impressive doesn't say we're in the movie yet she said so much this is a lot of damn town but Richard Jenkins was also great as her friend she doesn't have a lot of friends so Richard Jenkins is really her only friend bland Octavia Spencer and the end fibbys creature she made so Richard Jenkins is always great at bringing heart into any movies in he's one of the people you wish was your neighbor my neighbors actually watch this guy's I love you too but if you guys move out I hope Richard Jenkins character and this movie moves in but the whole character dynamic in this movie really was a great representation of family with no blood ties whatsoever and that was really for like a better word sweet and that's really what it is is how I can describe this movie this movie is a very sweet movie about connections I've seen a lot of people and critics who review movies saying this is one of the best movies of the year it did not hit that realm for me but I just found the movie very sweet the connection she forms with this creature from the Black Lagoon type being is the most unexpected connection since Naomi Watts and the ape from King Kong but I'm always interested when a director can show and convey that kind of connection showing that human connection really isn't limited to humans the movies also kind of totally unbalanced for me it's kind of a guillermo del toro way of things here's a sweet movie blood Wow hmm sometimes it's bloody sometimes it's violent you can argue well that's life but if it was life itself I take a step back and I'm like sometimes life that's as a little tonally uneven that that sucked for you to do that life I mean it for nothing else at least it got the accurate ad campaign that crimson peak that guillermo del toro did before this didn't get people winning the crimson peak alright horror movie they walked out like uh or gothic romance that was weird this movie goes the more sweet connection route and actually accurately presents it not like they were like here's Creature from the Black Lagoon the horror movie guys in the end if you're a guillermo del toro found you like his imagination you like his presentation and you sway to the side of liking arthouse films is gonna be the movie for you i appreciated this movie i enjoyed this movie now let's say the shape of water is a nice time no alcohol acquired alright so the shape of water have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more [Music]
