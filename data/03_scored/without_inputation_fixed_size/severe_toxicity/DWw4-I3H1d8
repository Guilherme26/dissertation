the critics and reviewers have already said you should not go into this film expecting,0.10638881
a big action alien invasion war movie it's just not going for that demographic if,0.10522074
you are looking for that then you should go and watch the snooze fest that,0.026817543
is Independence Day resurgence because this is a proper grown-up sci-fi drama with an emphasis,0.036754057
on the drama and like all of the good sci-fi dramas before it this film,0.05979003
isn't really about the aliens there the setting the emotional core of this film is,0.017357968
the humans and it's all anchored by a terrific performance by Amy Adams if you,0.13855577
don't empathize or sympathize with her character's introduction then there's something wrong with you she,0.052163035
is so good in this film you really go through the motions with her from,0.047659744
the initial shock and awe of the aliens arriving to the pressure that mounts on,0.03852544
her as she's got to decipher their language she's got a real vulnerability but a,0.049072593

there's any weaknesses there it's in the writing of the character I thought he was,0.015503435
fine I actually quite liked his character I would happily go for a beer with,0.029165642
him but really the real stars of this film are Denis Villeneuve his direction and,0.050308503
the cinematography by Bradford Yan I was initially bummed to find out that Roger Deakins,0.020948628
wasn't gonna be the cinematographer for this but it turns out I had nothing to,0.038022563
worry about Bradford Young did an excellent job it's a visually gorgeous film and I,0.03196274
also really liked the production design which is going for simple but very very effective,0.017021384
in terms of the spaceships and the way that the aliens look I'm not going,0.055588067
to spoil that but they're called hectare pods which might give you a clue as,0.01570432
to what they look like and I also have to mention the score and the,0.02229097
sound design in terms of the score it really reminded me of Star Trek a,0.011758451
voyage home when that spaceship arrives at earth and it's got that whale-like sound that's,0.0447775
what the score is like in this but much more ominous and foreboding it's perfect,0.057654794
and the aliens themselves have two forms of communication they have an audible form which,0.054814458
really reminded me of the Muto's from Godzilla and they also have a written language,0.019157954
which the plot revolves around that's one that the humans are trying to decipher it's,0.014191693
this ink like circles I really liked the science behind it I didn't understand any,0.03830726
of it but I really liked it now in general I do like to try,0.03922322
and give a balanced review and I do have a couple of gripes with this,0.01662427
film which I think times with what a lot of other people have already said,0.02425193
there were a couple of technical things like some of the CGI looked like CGI,0.030019073
particularly some CGI hair which is very obvious but it didn't ruin my overall experience,0.073109
of the film and there are certain lines of dialogue which are said in certain,0.008234974
situations which made it feel a little bit corny and there are some pacing issues,0.1376112
as well I do think that there is a big revelation which is wrapped up,0.030012421
very quickly I think the film would have benefited from being maybe 20 minutes longer,0.014421847
which would have allowed them to sort out the pacing issues but other than that,0.028615536
it absolutely delivered it was everything that I wanted it to be so that's my,0.029370518
thoughts on arrival and pause the video if you want to take a closer look,0.10870697
at my enjoyment record now overall I think arrival is a fantastic thought-provoking sci-fi that,0.026735062
absolutely deserves its place amongst the best of them and I sincerely mean that then,0.09158581
evil nerve is a master of suspense and tension the first half an hour of,0.1779027
this film is exhilarating there was a moment when it's all building up to us,0.049798973
first meeting the aliens when my heart rate was just thumping and my rate of,0.062358305
breath increased in fact at one point it was in sync with one of the,0.017052649
characters on the screen we were both like I will never forget that there's so,0.013240481
much more to talk about I finally understand what all of the other reviewers mean,0.03936956
when they say that there is so many layers to this film there's a lot,0.026722422
of themes which it's touching on I think it's touching on love and loss and,0.108573936
communication interpretation science versus language and our understanding of all of that stuff and our,0.014673286
understanding of each other can't we all just get along there's also another underlying theme,0.016110083
which I really want to talk about but I can't because it forms part of,0.011455793
the big revelation but I think what I'm gonna do is do a spoiler review,0.04248927
I'm gonna go and see it again and soak it all up and then over,0.027615765
