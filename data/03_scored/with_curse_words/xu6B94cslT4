I realize that the propaganda war movies in Hollywood was making during the 1940s we're,0.09229491
not a good idea right that's that's not good for anyone although of course when,0.098486036
you see what Christopher Nolan has done here you understand why they did that because,0.08619422
I think that hooker boy the pendulum has totally swung too far in the other,0.8025406
direction with this film and I am genuinely shocked at the way Christopher Nolan has,0.04867557
decided to portray British soldiers in this film he's British why would he send us,0.13822074
about his own military and his fellow citizens who who put their lives on the,0.09903607
line to protect England I mean it's just absolutely incredible as I tweeted he swaps,0.08147283
Band of Brothers you know that idea for world war ii with every man for,0.20185167
himself and some people when i tweeted that row like well that's what it was,0.072950095
like grace it was really tough out there you know it was all about survival,0.057467557
particularly at Dunkirk but I'm talking about every man for himself against fellow soldiers against,0.10923126
allies against civilians I mean after this movie if you saw a British soldier you,0.2682315
would be like I don't know if I'd make it out of this encounter alive,0.31235808
because that person is all that for himself and I realized that there might be,0.10407486
some soldiers like that but to to say that all soldiers are that way I,0.09705122
think it's really a disservice to the incredibly heroic and kind majority of soldiers that,0.18589364
exist which we know because of the stories and the medals and the real stories,0.051342484
this is a fiction so the fact that it would try and change that narrative,0.0951251
to me is really odd and there were two deaths in the movie in particular,0.13249746
that really bothered me you'll know when you see him and actually even made me,0.14226744
angry because neither one had to happen and it shouldn't have happened they were both,0.07618181
just cold human cruelty and selfishness for British soldiers against people it was just crazy,0.5876557
and again this is fiction nolan wrote this and if he's going to portray british,0.24027345
soldiers in this manner he better damn well back it up i'm very curious to,0.51925266
hear how people feel about this down in the comments who have a military background,0.06843886
are currently involved in the military both if you're overseas and if you're an American,0.121462576
military person I think in May I'm just I really curious to see what the,0.065769866
reaction is because mine was not good now no one of course wants an Oscar,0.08388135
and he clearly was aiming for Spielberg Cameron territory here to fellow wildly successful directors,0.12573735
commercially who were ignored by the Academy until Saving Private Ryan and Titanic but instead,0.14873181
because of the flaws that have kept Nolan from being nominated to date and he,0.07126275
just can't help himself you know I'm surprised he wasn't more self-aware to figure out,0.106735215
what the problems where it's hard to be it's hard to do that anyway I,0.15053259
think he should have studied Spielberg and Cameron more carefully but instead of going in,0.087981015
their direction he ended up going Mallik Terrence Malick The Thin Red Line specifically mixed,0.22384171
with Pixar and I'm not talking early Pixar I'm talking you know the really obvious,0.12386745
Pixar of today that is aggressively bleak and emotionally manipulative like I was watching this,0.30250376
movie and I'm like oh I bet this is going to happen now because that,0.10384048
would just make this even sadder then I was like oh yeah I did okay,0.087322995
on and till you but you don't cry can you just annoy and it just,0.31451422
makes everybody in the movie unlikable now I'm sure some of you right now like,0.24174687
but I like the thin red line Greg you're horrible why aren't you more self-aware,0.656285
I know you guys well some of you we don't want to paint everybody with,0.13274038
the same brush like Nolan does right and that's great I'm glad you like the,0.10695696
Thin Red Line but the film was not successful with mainstream audiences it made just,0.060713474
like 36 million dollars domestic and this one will obviously do much better than that,0.08227831
because it's a Christian for Nolan movie and it's so well reviewed and has all,0.25198254
this Oscar talk we'll get to that in a moment but I do suspect will,0.06470003
be one of his least successful because I think that a lot of people in,0.15135615
Middle America will not like it I mean people who like American sniper aren't going,0.40326968
to like this movie I'm sure some of you are like well I hate it,0.7093121
in there I mean war divides people and we'll see we'll see how in box,0.33342502
office dollars how many people like this really bleak negative portrayal of it with all,0.17614356
the heroics isn't sucked out of it and kindness I also think that it won't,0.27003905
be successful just for some other reasons there's hardly any dialogue and oh the dialogue,0.06588728
they do have it's very hard to hear like an remember an interstellar Michael Caine,0.10925043
he was like I have diseases we really important to you and like everybody in,0.33757168
the theater was like woody say did you understand it that happens for a number,0.082435094
of lines here as well although I'm going to get the shout out to the,0.15103357
sound design person in a moment mostly for the vs the the sound effects also,0.08250719
we use a nonlinear storytelling device three different stories to take place over different periods,0.0812966
of time like a week like two days or something in an hour or a,0.04991995
day in an hour and they don't make it very it's very hard to follow,0.073030785
and I don't think it pays off even or not at the end of the,0.08800169
movie you're not like oh that's why you did that good show you're like yeah,0.38827506
you could have just totally got rid of that and then also let's just again,0.43254173
very aggressively bleak and negative and its portrayal of soldiers I was also surprised that,0.11766263
upend hardly any attention to the civilians who willingly drove their boats their tiny little,0.18355668
boats into a war zone that's the narrative hook for this movie the Dunkirk story,0.10548898
Spielberg and Cameron would have recognized this and you know that's where Nolan messed up,0.09357013
I think and that's why I think it's going to ultimately cost him the Oscar,0.06359703
and I will talk to you more about that just a moment when we get,0.06834664
to know himself but interestingly a movie came out just a few months ago called,0.06127819
world's finest from the UK as well Chris Nolan's British and not understood that was,0.14562352
the angle that was the human interest angle that's the word of the Dunkirk story,0.06224283
and this movie doesn't do that I think that Spielberg and Cameron would have realized,0.109125935
that what you need to do is to get the audience watching the movie to,0.057092138
ask themselves they would do such a thing today let's say the military was like,0.059318766
you know whatever country you're in your government said we have soldiers stranded behind enemy,0.2652226
lines and none of our vehicles for some reason are working we need you to,0.03685125
drive your own car and pick up a bunch of them would you do it,0.15121223
what you know in an active war zone where you were in mortal danger and,0.17872739
from soldiers to - well as you'll see in this movie but anyway I will,0.12029722
say to be fair that this is a stunning achievement when it comes to the,0.054432265
film craftsmanship outside of storytelling in fact think this is the best that no one,0.10204486
has ever achieved in that regard and I have no doubt that this one will,0.07664148
be nominated for numerous awards particularly in those categories also its IMAX cinematography alone is,0.07805671
revolutionary and if you are going to see this film you would be doing yourself,0.36222538
a disservice not to see it in the IMAX format a real IMAX not a,0.1504392
fake baby IMAX I mean it just fills it the whole screen and it's just,0.37649864
a breathtaking picture it was truly it was truly an experience in every sense of,0.08360564
the word and I think it gives the movie a lot of leeway especially toward,0.07191875
the beginning until you just crumpled under the bleakness of it and the ability to,0.31089434
follow the story I also feel it Hans Zimmer who I just finished the other,0.06692179
day saying has never produced a score that I think is particularly memorable he does,0.11046866
his best work ever here I mean in fact I think the movie succeeds because,0.08529829
of Zimmer score points in who attend with cinematography and Richard Kings sound design specifically,0.08226859
the sound effects it's just a really good trio they do they do amazing work,0.07875847
and then I think for best score back to best score right now I would,0.069293894
say that the Oscar you know award season it's going to right now it's between,0.050767258
Zimmer and Michael chiquinho for warfare the Planet of the Apes the the work they,0.36196837
both do is career-defining I feel there's a chance that Noland still won't be nominated,0.061195873
here though for director I think that could be the case or you'll be nominated,0.09307109
and I don't think I think for sure he won't win unless things get political,0.1352715
unless everybody decides that it's time for Nolan to win another Best directing Oscar but,0.05495787
I think this film especially because you have to consider that so many people who,0.11766962
are trying to change the voter ship particularly to the Academy Awards a lot of,0.054127958
them are from the greatest generation I think they would be particularly offended by the,0.22885326
way those soldiers are portrayed and he should have thought of that when it was,0.06626765
making the movie how every Weinstein whatever although he's not doing through all these days,0.1537189
either available no one is not just the director but also the writer so it's,0.030539764
his fault that the film misses the mark storytelling lies both in terms of the,0.17966159
ability to follow it and also emotional payoff and engagement so those are the reasons,0.065488055
he usually has it nominated so he still has the exact same problem now acting,0.08789523
wise there's nothing Tom Hardy can't do he's just such a profession it's a joy,0.11624308
to watch him work he's not asked to do much here I mean this is,0.15264069
the kind of role that he could do in asleep and be warned he has,0.14213082
a very very small roll back most people list movie have a very small role,0.10286521
and again when they are on screen there's no dialogue for the most part so,0.04526567
you have to look at the actors most of the time and in that regard,0.058857087
Hardy's fellow pilot played by Jack Loudoun was really cool looking he had this really,0.06858023
old-fashioned bunch of 1940s Michael J Fox look like it was just like you were,0.5154597
like oh you don't really see that anymore I mean he's just perfect for the,0.116052106
movie so he just looked great I really thought he was fantastic I can't tell,0.10695447
you how good of an actor it was because it was gonna have to do,0.14911123
very much acting but he was better than Harry Styles I'm sorry to say because,0.09312696
I was really excited about Harry Styles in this movie I was like oh he's,0.08613288
gonna be bigger than Justin Timberlake why isn't he in the trailer more I know,0.082508355
why he wasn't in the trailer more he's not a good actor I never once,0.23982325
believed he was in any real danger or was actually at war especially when he,0.15657495
was next to his co-stars you were like ah those guys seem really just in,0.12582336
despair you know Harry Styles was that he was just told to seem like he,0.06254598
was in despair and he was doing the best he could also he played such,0.071178034
a despicable human being that if I were his management team I really would have,0.60452294
advised him against taking a role I know it's Nolan but I think he did,0.120139405
not come out particularly well I mean I his fans will still love him but,0.15474679
anyone who's new to Harry Styles would be like that jerk from Dunkirk ah now,0.8635859
I know a lot of you won't be able to resist seeing this film partially,0.17634892
because the number of you won't believe that what I'm saying is true because of,0.10025679
Nolan's reputation in fact when I was walking out of the theater I asked another,0.07167658
critic that I've seen it number numerous screenings I said would you think of the,0.040346704
movie he said I liked it of course but it's like like who could dare,0.12230792
not love a Christopher Nolan movie like why add me of course it was was,0.111863054
very to me because I hated it so much Emperor's New Clothes kind of a,0.26026627
mentality oh I similar problems with baby driver in fact and I think if you,0.4179904
like baby driver you might like Dunkirk maybe you know I'll put you in that,0.41855985
category as a movie goer in the first 45 minutes of the movie or so,0.059470575
are very good because they're so over the technical craftsmanship and so again you're like,0.07177776
oh it's pretty good and like it's bad but I could also tell you though,0.14921893
that I had plans to see it again on Sunday night but I cancelled them,0.15892436
after seeing the presque reading because I was like I just can't sit through this,0.068546765
movie again but I know that some of you could you've already seen it I've,0.07888856
enjoyed it and I'm sure that many more will enjoy it but I think many,0.056392387
and more will also agree with me so let's keep it civil in the comment,0.057212714
section down below as we discuss our differing opinions on Dunkirk and also try to,0.105199486
see it not just from your perspective but it's lighted you know from an awards,0.068981774
perspective do you think it'll do well during award season and not just because you,0.074759334
think it deserves an Oscar but knowing how the Academy votes who votes etcetera the,0.10797441
politics of it all try and keep that in mind as well and their history,0.10748343
of voting the patterns that have emerged all right thank you so much for tuning,0.065309346
