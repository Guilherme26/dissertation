you're getting from me I'm afraid I do think that you will enjoy this film,0.29575056
the less you know about it but I have to echo what a lot of,0.08840878
the critics and reviewers have already said you should not go into this film expecting,0.24032128
a big action alien invasion war movie it's just not going for that demographic if,0.1632854
you are looking for that then you should go and watch the snooze fest that,0.08082577
is Independence Day resurgence because this is a proper grown-up sci-fi drama with an emphasis,0.102585874
on the drama and like all of the good sci-fi dramas before it this film,0.13536097
isn't really about the aliens there the setting the emotional core of this film is,0.076969765
the humans and it's all anchored by a terrific performance by Amy Adams if you,0.19576563
don't empathize or sympathize with her character's introduction then there's something wrong with you she,0.15416038
is so good in this film you really go through the motions with her from,0.10365348
the initial shock and awe of the aliens arriving to the pressure that mounts on,0.080553204
her as she's got to decipher their language she's got a real vulnerability but a,0.16328548
hidden strength it's a terrific performance she should be going up against herself in the,0.14579862
Oscars this year for her performance in nocturnal animals she's playing a different character but,0.07947571
she's equally as good in this she's also supported by a great cast which includes,0.17197974
Forest Whitaker as the general that recruits her she also meets with Jeremy Renner's physicist,0.14862172
who's there to help her decipher their language I know a lot of people have,0.11349246
felt a bit if the about his character I think his performance is fine if,0.08439319
there's any weaknesses there it's in the writing of the character I thought he was,0.053549405
fine I actually quite liked his character I would happily go for a beer with,0.06277802
him but really the real stars of this film are Denis Villeneuve his direction and,0.12302357
the cinematography by Bradford Yan I was initially bummed to find out that Roger Deakins,0.057133026
wasn't gonna be the cinematographer for this but it turns out I had nothing to,0.08094147
worry about Bradford Young did an excellent job it's a visually gorgeous film and I,0.08216692
also really liked the production design which is going for simple but very very effective,0.04814828
in terms of the spaceships and the way that the aliens look I'm not going,0.11282568
to spoil that but they're called hectare pods which might give you a clue as,0.06728438
to what they look like and I also have to mention the score and the,0.0588812
sound design in terms of the score it really reminded me of Star Trek a,0.04146846
voyage home when that spaceship arrives at earth and it's got that whale-like sound that's,0.10339729
what the score is like in this but much more ominous and foreboding it's perfect,0.106360994
and the aliens themselves have two forms of communication they have an audible form which,0.11216144
really reminded me of the Muto's from Godzilla and they also have a written language,0.06275955
which the plot revolves around that's one that the humans are trying to decipher it's,0.052541405
this ink like circles I really liked the science behind it I didn't understand any,0.09263415
of it but I really liked it now in general I do like to try,0.074018925
and give a balanced review and I do have a couple of gripes with this,0.046375267
film which I think times with what a lot of other people have already said,0.057246804
there were a couple of technical things like some of the CGI looked like CGI,0.06325253
particularly some CGI hair which is very obvious but it didn't ruin my overall experience,0.18426964
of the film and there are certain lines of dialogue which are said in certain,0.019865518
situations which made it feel a little bit corny and there are some pacing issues,0.3007946
as well I do think that there is a big revelation which is wrapped up,0.06427947
very quickly I think the film would have benefited from being maybe 20 minutes longer,0.035915885
which would have allowed them to sort out the pacing issues but other than that,0.06886529
it absolutely delivered it was everything that I wanted it to be so that's my,0.06975024
thoughts on arrival and pause the video if you want to take a closer look,0.15097147
at my enjoyment record now overall I think arrival is a fantastic thought-provoking sci-fi that,0.06281048
absolutely deserves its place amongst the best of them and I sincerely mean that then,0.11525818
evil nerve is a master of suspense and tension the first half an hour of,0.3187905
this film is exhilarating there was a moment when it's all building up to us,0.087538116
first meeting the aliens when my heart rate was just thumping and my rate of,0.104633704
breath increased in fact at one point it was in sync with one of the,0.045000248
characters on the screen we were both like I will never forget that there's so,0.04552739
much more to talk about I finally understand what all of the other reviewers mean,0.08657537
when they say that there is so many layers to this film there's a lot,0.06429501
of themes which it's touching on I think it's touching on love and loss and,0.24762133
communication interpretation science versus language and our understanding of all of that stuff and our,0.046599176
understanding of each other can't we all just get along there's also another underlying theme,0.063021265
which I really want to talk about but I can't because it forms part of,0.036944963
the big revelation but I think what I'm gonna do is do a spoiler review,0.09822504
I'm gonna go and see it again and soak it all up and then over,0.05524796
