oh hello everybody and Happy New Year,0.028156694
I'm pretty sure you can't still say that when it's like the 20th of January so I have been a little bit quiet on the YouTube front with kicking off the New Year but there have just been just too many movies to see and too little time first of all problems okay,0.20220664
so I put out a little Twitter poll to get me started with what to review first and here it is you said moonlight,0.14911729
so let's get into it directed by the indie filmmaker Barry Jenkins moonlight is a story about this african-american boy who is growing up feeling alienated feeling different dealing with feelings of homosexuality and struggling with all of that sort of pressure from society and his family structure around him that comes with it says in the rough neck of the woods in Miami Florida split into three separate acts,0.35556903
and played by three separate,0.045634195
actors we see the character shyrone as a young boy then as a teenager and finally as an adult this movie has been getting all kinds of awards and generating heaps of buzz and discussion because of its minority focused subject matter the Golden Globe Awards were a couple of weeks ago now and even though it was the film la-la-land which cleaned up moonlight,0.089809984
still it took home at Best Picture in the drama category which is pretty outstanding,0.05361205
this is the kind of film which feels both grand and intricate at the exact same time,0.050400946
the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous as there's so much detail there's all these close-ups which really get you up close and personal into Schiro ins life at times the camera is literally being knocked around as it's you know bumping up against players in a impromptu football game or ducking in and around and under the waves of the water as shyrone is learning how to swim,0.15983312
I think it feels so intricate because while as a whole this is a story about one man struggling to come to terms with the person,0.06106939
he is versus the person that everyone around him thinks he should be,0.15036345
and it's in those details of interactions between two characters that are at times,0.08213669
so quiet,0.06926055
so ordinary like Tyrone making a bed or waiting to eat his dinner in a diner,0.3370981
it's a collection of these really simple moments pieced together that create a really beautiful and honest portrait of this character,0.1688361
this is a film which is somehow managed to go beyond the innate stereotypes of masculinity and gender or of race,0.16879973
or the fact that shyrone has an absent father and a crack addict mother doesn't feel overworked it doesn't feel over scripted and it's just one man's story of inner struggle and of searching to belong,0.33835047
this really was quite an astonishing film,0.24454074
and I really really hope that as the Oscars season is approaching that this film just really gets in there and gets the nomination because it just kind of feels like the climate out there is right for a film like this to get a bit of traction and to just make an impact in the film world in the film community there you go guys,0.050654
