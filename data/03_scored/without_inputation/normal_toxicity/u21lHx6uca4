festival here in Austin which is where I'm still at right,0.07918101
now it doesn't end until this weekend and so first and foremost that when I was pets Jordan I went outside in the hot Sun I was sweating in places I didn't know that I could sweat in just to see this movie and I'm happy to say that it was actually worth it,0.096827686
and hopefully I lost a couple of pounds in the process of being a high at sweating outside um so first and foremost is film centers around this family,0.055993576
who's basically going on a vacation,0.05648859
they're chilling at their little summer vacation home,0.06675087
I say who had a summer vacation cause I sure as hell did it but they're on their way to vacation,0.2461791
everything seems to be going well everyone's having a great time,0.089260034
I'm having a great time watching them have a great time until they are confronted by the evil doppelganger versions of themselves,0.26218113
and then you know what it's just hits the fan after that,0.16800578
and then I was taking on the Sterling and suspenseful ride that I was just like whoo,0.08825529
I was screaming,0.06559578
I was jumping always be screaming and jumping people's looking to be crazy in the movie I was like,0.48609677
yeah,0.040847696
this is actually scary,0.11926547
I don't understand what you're watching but I know what I'm watching right now but I have to say I really did enjoy this film,0.15408136
one of the main things that I loved about this film was how they were able to balance the use of suspense,0.081635416
and there's even a little bit of blood and gore in this film as well kind of with the comedy,0.24036525
there's actually a lot of comedy in this film I'm mainly given by Winston Dukes character but I was just like wow this is kind of like a dark comedy and I'm actually loving the vibe because I feel as though the comedy hit in the best parts it didn't take away from you still being scared and didn't take away from the suspense that the film was giving I just thought that everything was so well balanced and I have to say can we go ahead and put Dukan a romantic comedy because after watching him at us I was just like he can definitely pull this off,0.09497118
and I am so here for it,0.054785036
and thank you listen dupe for letting people know that thick thighs matter because they do yeah also too Lupita,0.37409803
yeah Lupita did the damn thing,0.77457577
I was just like girl,0.10526351
so you gonna sort of parent give us this little oscar-worthy performance like this plan these two characters which I have to give kudos to the entire cast for doing so because they're not only just playing kind of this the regular versions of themselves,0.14135635
they also do a very great job of showing the distinct difference between who their evil,0.31089434
doppelganger is versus to the characters that we were introduced to in the beginning of the film I thought it was very well done and kudos to everyone but Lupita Lupita is the one who took it all the way home,0.042229805
she knocked it out of the park,0.2926641
I was like yes girl,0.14926878
yes,0.036876976
I was here for everything that she was possibly in,0.101411514
so also - I do appreciate that this is a different tone a film than what we were used to and get out and I really do feel as though I have to make sure I've set the correct expectations for those who are watching the film because I think it will help enhance your viewing,0.04583902
experience this is not a political movie as get out was this is not a racial movie as get out was there are certain type of political things but not what you were thinking in regards to,0.14056893
race and get out was kind of more in-your-face as to what was happening throughout the course of the film and I have to say that I appreciate Jordan going into a different route,0.12525216
now for those of you who might be for those of you who might be more caught up or and get out I do feel as though some people may feel as though get out was the better film however because I love that he brings in more aspects of the horror the blood the gore,0.17698793
and then even to this underlying story of you know where are these people coming from who are they you know trying to figure out,0.08330843
what that plan is I love how the movie makes you leave the theater continuously thinking okay,0.10710521
and if you thought that you had all these theories forget out you're definitely gonna have a ton of theories as far as what US brings to the table,0.087180756
and what I will say is this is definitely a movie that you're not gonna get everything,0.2393195
the first time um,0.058166947
I think I talked to someone from the studio who actually saw the movie over six times,0.08969563
they were just like there's something new that I gathered from the film each time that I watch it,0.07442673
so this is definitely going to be a multiple repeat viewing,0.064063326
I don't know if there's necessarily anything that I didn't like more from a nitpicky standpoint will be more,0.09080624
so I wanted to know more about a certain subtype that was happening in the film and I didn't feel as though all those questions were answered but I don't know if they were necessarily supposed to be answer,0.04912437
I think it was really supposed to make people leaving the theater,0.07589396
thinking like I wonder if this is what happened,0.07213193
and so for that I will have to say overall for us,0.10518472
you gotta pay to see the film and theater,0.09051484
it's okay it gave me horn,0.31980157
it gave me suspense it gave me last it gave us great performances that would definitely keep you thinking from the time that you sit,0.16688773
you're a little behind in that movie till you walk out and probably for the rest of the year because I guarantee there's gonna be some great series popping up from this movie,0.15935959
so those are pretty much,0.05748122
my thoughts on us,0.07890753
