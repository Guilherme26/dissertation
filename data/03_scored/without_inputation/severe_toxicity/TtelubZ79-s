the bat I'm a give me the nerdy remember that 90's television show Herman's head,0.16086268
on Fox you ever thought yourself what if like years later they made that a,0.041869983
cartoon best synopsis ever first the good Pixar has had a couple of rough patches,0.058798242
we usually have seen them as the studio that made quality movies but a couple,0.009350486
we were like yeah inside out I am happy to say is one of the,0.04605665
good ones it is a really good movie and what really helps this film are,0.02846986
the emotions themselves they're really good characters and what's great about them is they could,0.023385862
have easily been OneNote one-dimensional characters but they aren't they definitely display their specific emotion,0.023494951
their specific characteristic but they have moments that go against that characteristic sometimes they are,0.030572506
able to be fully fleshed out characters inside the brain of this little girl riley,0.30053237
particularly sadness like you're just thinking she's gonna be a sad sack the whole time,0.14264132
but about the end of this movie i swear to you you will be in,0.117084295
love with sadness she's just a great great character Phyllis Smith puts a dynamite performance,0.0662483
on that character and easily one of the greatest characters in this movie but everyone,0.018226696
does a great job in is Amy Poehler perfect choice for joy Mindy Kaling the,0.013700788
perfect choice for the disgust Bill Hader perfect judge my fear it was black her,0.41442135
choice for anger it's like they really nailed down the right actors to play the,0.06419421
parts of these emotions I also love the creativity in this movie of how they,0.11013445
show you how Riley's brain works how memories are stored how she has core idea,0.098439194
that she is interested in and those turned into these islands what happens to her,0.033259183
memories how they get lost all the different types of things that happen when your,0.036476675
brain they put some kind of creative spin of how it works through the animation,0.049956623
or through the storytelling and it's just phenomenal the movie is not a laugh riot,0.025195826
but when it does humor it's actually good humor and what's nice about this movie,0.022743294
is that it has the jokes that the kids are gonna enjoy but it has,0.027358338
a lot of like really so humor because it's talking about the brain is talking,0.09363657
about neuroscience there's different kinds of jokes and references that it makes to that sort,0.018247318
of subject matter that adults are probably gonna get more than kids so I always,0.030674944
love it when a family movie has those kind of layers but you know for,0.048690777
every comedy when it comes to Pixar you gotta bring those pigs are tears man,0.28339803
there's certain parts of the movies gonna make you a little sad make you cry,0.05407145
there's gonna be one particular character which they don't really show on the trailer so,0.012775517
I'm not gonna say what it is or who it is but there's a character,0.041383736
that you'll meet along the way in this movie and you're gonna be like okay,0.07211456
this is like a cool character oh he's bringing some humor to it it's kind,0.04200036
of funny and the way they switch it on you you better watch this movie,0.040743165
in 3d and cover your eyes and glasses because it's Gumby it's gonna be some,0.090017974
Pixar tears man a little lamp and like so make everybody cry I talked about,0.13772628
another Disney movie earlier this summer that came out and said that this heart was,0.025185848
in the right place with its moral but it just kind of told you more,0.034507733
than showed you this movie doesn't complete opposite the moral of the story they want,0.029180275
to tell you but you take away from this thing which i think is a,0.04684689
very important message they show it in the movie through its storytelling they do it,0.03682989
through very quintessential important scenes that show exactly what they're trying to showcase to you,0.025890278
if they make it crystal clear what they're trying to convey it's gonna be hard,0.036268473
to say some bad about it not necessarily bad just more like something you shouldn't,0.026756346
know like I said this movie does have some jokes but it is not a,0.018329136
beginning to finish laugh riot and the only reason why I said that is because,0.052436426
when you see names like Amy Poehler Bill Hader Lewis Black Mindy Kaling pills from,0.02628207
the office when you see all these names you're gonna be like oh man there's,0.02908582
gonna be the funniest movie ever comedians particularly improv comedians they're able to bring these,0.06717689
little quirks and nuances and different parts of the character so again not make them,0.081955284
one-dimensional since their emotions so just know that going in there will be funny moments,0.02133909
there definitely be some parts will to make you laugh out loud but just so,0.022080772
you know they're picked more for the characters that they can convey out of these,0.017969936
emotions not necessarily because of the quote unquote comedy and again while they do have,0.021653723
a lot of jokes in here that are gonna be for adults this is definitely,0.01883268
a story aimed for the younger set you could sorta see this movie as an,0.032650538
introduction to how your emotions are and how they work and how to deal with,0.032168947
them therefore there's gonna be a couple of times it is definitely gonna be aimed,0.05725701
towards younger people but at the same time still enjoyable and I know they only,0.065211944
want to have the core emotions in here but it would have been nice to,0.02426856
see a few more emotions even if just in cameos this movie kind of sets,0.034295537
itself up for a possible sequel and given what they would have to go to,0.04297153
next with the sequel which would make perfect sense I could see that sequel possibly,0.07338439
popping out a couple more emotions that we would get in an inside out too,0.07769079
so maybe that will happen enough of the nerdy most of the time you are,0.1768098
in Riley's brain but there are certain points in the movie particularly during the Critias,0.11395394
at the end so at least watch the first part of the credits where we,0.024794055
get to see the emotions inside the brains of other people and that's funny it's,0.17085841
some of the funniest parts in this movie that's a really good jokes in there,0.05044553
and I hope again if they make a sequel to this that's something that they,0.06625961
play around with in the second one and make sure you get there early because,0.03241041
before the movie you're actually gonna get a pixar short called lava and let me,0.11390405
just say at the end of it you're gonna want to hug a volcano don't,0.022906264
hug an active volcano about that would probably kill you this is a very good,0.43411934
quality movie that's imaginative that's creative and it has a lot of heart and definitely,0.0108970385
one of the best films to take your family to it's gonna give you some,0.11535748
joy and it's gonna give you some sadness and the only anger disgust or fear,0.12837712
that's gonna come from this movie is dizzy and Pixar looking at the box office,0.03720838
to see if it'll be Jurassic world and if Jurassic world beats it they're gonna,0.059794687
be very angry and very disgusted let me know if you are planning on seeing,0.0842342
inside out and if you have so you don't let me know what you think,0.07159704
of it and make sure you're subscribed to black dirt comedy so you can see,0.38459876
all my movie reviews as well as other videos I love you like to play,0.03303036
