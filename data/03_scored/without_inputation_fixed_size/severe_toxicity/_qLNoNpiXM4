as someone who said his fair share of Moving's mentality difficulties and ethnic clashes in,0.07901517
the family I very strongly believe that the complexity of multicultural families is a very,0.0275253
difficult thing to tackle in any audio-visual form let alone a one and a half,0.03871502
hour feature of course I can't possibly speak for any expat family but mine and,0.0332971
I most definitely cannot compare my frankly very privileged position to the experience of chinese-american,0.24736713
families yet somehow Loula Wong's The Farewell manages to capture that unique charm of being,0.0101141175
stuck inside your own strangely cosmopolitan identity although while unfolding a universally congenial story that,0.06559841
is both profoundly sad and endearingly hilarious the film is a true account of Wong's,0.021686982
experiences with her family and follows her or Billie as she's called in the script,0.028664093
after she receives the news that her grandmother 9'i has been diagnosed with terminal lung,0.06314788
cancer and has only three months left to live ironically that isn't even the most,0.09861015
tragic fact due to Chinese tradition cancer patients don't always receive the news from hospitals,0.13332143
or their families and are left in the dark up until their very death so,0.3528912
using her cousin's fake wedding as a ploy to visit the grandmother Billie and her,0.19586267
parents traveled to China to bid nine a farewell let me just say this right,0.016415402
off the bat the farewell is a remarkable work for a multitude of reasons but,0.03203857
one that has to be mentioned at the forefront of this review is that Lula,0.023061251
Wang managed to direct this entirely personal incredibly heartfelt film well the fully chinese-american cast,0.082570575
and around 80% of the dialogue being in Mandarin for a crowd-pleasing PG rated film,0.045380823
like this and hopefully 8:24 give it a decently sized domestic release this truly is,0.040075984
a breakthrough in indie cinema of course we had crazy rich Asians last year but,0.37941983
that film had the backing of Warner Brothers and a somewhat established book fan base,0.0106788585
so the quality of that comparison is zero to none if you're watching this video,0.059810653
when the farewell is already out in your country please show your support it's an,0.064439
extraordinary film okay and now that I'm done with publicity let's talk about why the,0.12453102
farewells bleak subject matter is soba Musa Lee delightful in the context of our grim,0.047416285
everyday reality at the heart of it we have a timeless elegy that's rats in,0.13310525
this darkly comedic package of cultural traditions identity confusion and moving authenticity the farewell walks,0.029021297
on that thin line between comedy and tragedy there is a scene here is during,0.04459923
which a congratulatory speech turns it to what essentially is a eulogy a person breaks,0.025111347
down crying the camera slowly pans out to reveal the confused audience and the only,0.068143405
thing left for us the viewers is to laugh while trying to suppress that overwhelming,0.03489221
sense of sorrow the genuineness of the constructed narrative and the way she presents it,0.017305417
is what truly makes Lulu Wong suffer more efforts stand out she mentioned during the,0.036004394
Q&A that she was slightly inspired by the works of Roy Anderson and Ruben Auslan,0.010893048
but honestly I would argue that in the melancholic satirical works of those directors there,0.1732524
is always a conspicuous sense of detachment which is a stark contrast with Wong's direct,0.03102483
openness with a viewer she's ready to be vulnerable in front of the audience while,0.042293705
sharing a chapter in her book of life and I think that's a rare occurrence,0.09159246
in modern non documentary cinema in a way it kind of reminded me of the,0.017941998
light sanyas Varda and her approach to storytelling so effortlessly assured yet delicate and wise,0.027236609
and the fellows about tight-knit relatives and family values it's always crucial for the entire,0.023721779
production to be as invested in the script as your writers and your directors because,0.035969805
otherwise the work would just lose his distinctive sense of identity and that is usually,0.045996785
what the films of that kind of subject matter go for thankfully that is not,0.04413693
the case for the farewell because the end sum will cast and the crew pulled,0.026184289
off something miraculous here and I mean truly truly remarkable you not only believe this,0.023566127
seemingly preposterous for the Western society story but you also feel through every emotion that,0.040295497
the character Billy played by Aquafina ghost - it's a vividly spiritual experience that not,0.034782454
only says a lot about one's relationship with their family but also with themselves and,0.019704735
it is truly enhanced by awkwafina's remarkably tender performance she goes through so many emotional,0.0392312
states throughout the film it's very impressive to see what she did here it was,0.019022256
surprising to see her tackle such an emotionally challenging but she proves to be much,0.09906713
more than just the quirky character that Hollywood try to pitch her ass admittedly she,0.68235785
does have great comedic timing but she also has a very impressive dramatic range that,0.017003424
I hope to see more of in the coming years Lulu long mentioned that the,0.044612538
casting process was a very important aspect of her film and that she fought many,0.028082058
many years with many producers who did not want to fund a fully Asian cast,0.04259437
feature clearly after seeing the film I cannot possibly imagine a different outcome I think,0.024987623
that when I was watching the film it almost felt like every single character and,0.010984178
the actor blended in together it feels like they lived through their respective roles and,0.032572046
I think one of them actually did the nice sister in the film was played,0.022922229
by Wong's great on so it is the family feature really in every sense of,0.02106171
the word ones attention to detail is also evidence in the film's visual and musical,0.0050986325
choices grays and blues dominate the film's color palette reflecting the characters emotional states occasionally,0.0033704855
breaking into the hopeful orange and greens during the dream sequences that roaring borderline amusing,0.04695997
sadness is further intensified by Alex Weston's outstanding score that only amplifies the mournful ambience,0.042111445
of a wedding bouquet and the perplexing laughter that follows it's a scrupulously detailed film,0.070460245
that makes me wonder how come this is just one second feature a less skilled,0.04530499
director would have definitely gone for more flatulent pathos or emotional manipulation or maybe even,0.12851614
visual exuberance yet what Wang achieves here is so muted yet so effective and the,0.037280884
emotional qualities of the film reach their Apogee only at the very very end of,0.05432821
the film with a beautiful final shot now I know that I can be entirely,0.19142789
objective in the case of this film the portrayal of a character struggling with cultural,0.02106703
identity and belonging is something that hits very close to home I come from a,0.02789115
multicultural family my family members are scattered all across the world and right now I,0.23435621
live in the UK a country where I have no relatives whatsoever so the question,0.12072418
