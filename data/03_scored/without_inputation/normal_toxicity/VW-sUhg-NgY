and our final word coco follows the story of aspiring musician Miguel who enters the land of the dead to confront his family's ancestral ban on music overall,0.115137875
I absolutely loved this film,0.09281014
Pixar continues to dominate the world of animated film,0.16741012
and here's why for what I liked about this film,0.09868188
let's start off with the cast and characters,0.15481259
the cast does an outstanding job in part to some fun lovable and investable characters notable favorites to me are miguel dante and hector but that doesn't mean that all the other supporting characters are just as fun,0.042133283
and memorable the themes of this film are great as they tackle the ideas of family versus heart life and death these both play into the story of this film which is one of Pixar's most detailed and human stories so far it's such an original ideal with the typical twists turns and heart-tugging moments that Pixar is known for this film may not have the emotional effect that up did in its first couple minutes,0.103027016
but it's a slow burn to a very emotional,0.19443528
conclusion all I'm saying is bring tissues the story is nothing without,0.07203043
its main character,0.07054791
the animation this film shows why Pixar is the best in the business the intricate detail in the land of the dead to the light cast by candles and scenes it looks closer and closer to reality and that's a hard thing to do,0.079242766
and the story is accented by a phenomenal score,0.073470995
now it may not be as memorable as frozen or Moana,0.080372445
but Pixar does what they do best and make a phenomenal story and add the supporting character of the score into the forefront however the only net picky thing that I can really say about this film is that it's the same Pixar mold that we've seen time and time again and this story at its barebone cons is a very overdone and retold story but at the same time it's a family animated film,0.07784639
so do we really care that much and that's where I'll end,0.117501564
our spoiler free thoughts on this film,0.12013036

I love that this film tackles the idea of morality and life after death it really puts things into perspective for children who don't quite know where their ancestors go when they pass on,0.26329675
so this film really shows a beautiful expanded afterlife without throwing religious overtones on it,0.25476444
I found that the reveal that Hector was Miguel's true ancestor was fairly predictable Miguel is watching Ernesto de la Cruz play on his guitar,0.18696015
and you see on the guitar,0.118949205
that there's a skull,0.32038602
and in the skull,0.57883185
there is a gold tooth,0.12699425
and that's the exact same gold tooth,0.10987983
that Hector has in the land of the dead,0.28382173
so that was very easy to put together on top of that it was kind of predictable that Hector would need a more prominent storyline other than someone who's just gonna show Miguel around and the best scenes to me were the introduction to the land of the dead Miguel's attic shrine his performance at the Plaza,0.10481721
and the final emotional moment where the family is all together so with the thoughts heard here's our final word Coco is an ambitious animated film that successfully tackles a deeply rich culture,0.07449399
it's masterful animation original story lovable characters and serious themes proved that Pixar continues to seize the moment this film was definitely entertaining and a tearjerker at that so I'm gonna give Coco a 9,0.08314963
