hey everybody today I am going to be reviewing portrait of a lady on fire,0.49966237
this film came out in 2019 it was written and directed by Celine Dion sciama,0.030683592
identifies very strongly as like a feminist artist and I think her movies really reflect,0.096624576
that notion a bit she makes movies that tend to be about women movies that,0.07773802
have to do with sexual identity and gender identity portrait of a lady on fire,0.4661155
seems to be her most ambitious film particularly aesthetically and the film has received a,0.04567417
lot of critical acclaim and it's considered an artistic triumph for me though admittedly I,0.013189262
I've struggled with my point of view on the film and I struggled with with,0.016809857
how I was going to do this review I did have to see it twice,0.052516248
so that I kind of solidified my opinions a little bit but I am still,0.044527393
torn because the filmmaker and her point of view to me there are things about,0.033550534
her that I think are very nuanced and very interesting but then there are other,0.023512911
aspects of her point of view that I think Mar the sophistication of the images,0.033425476
and the ideas behind them and when you really admire somebody artistically that you think,0.06760328
has the ability to really go the full nine yards it kind of it becomes,0.040595494
frustrating and it makes it all the more frustrating that the film just wasn't quite,0.03790283
doing it for me I liked bits of it but as a whole it didn't,0.03234522
come together for me and my feelings on it are a little muddled I'm going,0.14444728
to start talking about the things that I like about the film because I don't,0.021178117
want to give people the impression that I like I hate this movie or anything,0.1475078
like that no I'm just frustrated a little bit but I do think that the,0.045316964
film touches on some very interesting ideas and the premise itself is a wonderful setup,0.054625545
used as the catalyst to propel a love story you have a protagonist at the,0.053292517
center name is Mary Ann and she looks strikingly like Emma Watson like to a,0.04134316
crazy degree at least that's what I thought but her features are a little bit,0.09460907
harder she's a little bit harsher cheekbones and jawline and I think that that works,0.2490688
really well for her character because her character is meant to be a very rebellious,0.029542802
artist who is defying conventions and you would consider her maybe a modern woman for,0.06067007
the time that this takes place and this is her story this is her retelling,0.058708444
the story about how she fell in love with her subject she is an artist,0.031733252
and she was paid to paint a wedding portrait of a woman that the woman's,0.13286377
name is Elouise and she is very alluring great to turn a mysterious person who,0.11912973
definitely rejects the idea of being married off to somebody that she doesn't know and,0.057031516
sending a portrait to see if you know he approves and you know naturally that's,0.030255878
understandable so while you're watching the film you can never really take it at a,0.082798734
literal level you always have to look at it as though it's being seen through,0.019003632
a distorted filter through the eyes of an unreliable narrator because the person telling the,0.06054169
story is telling it from the point of view of somebody who was in in,0.028449904
love it's like you know romance so therefore it's going to be heightened and she,0.055786956
is very creative and observant and all of those things are going to kind of,0.014462423
bleed in to the imagery the filmmaking really reflects this it's beautifully made film where,0.070273325
it depends on its own minimalistic approach as the crux of the the building tension,0.049424477
throughout especially the erotic tension building the relationship between these two women and this is,0.14858672
done very effectively with very interesting camera shots I really enjoy the scenes it's particularly,0.13253517
when Eloise is introduced and it's following her so her face is obscured all you,0.10479436
can see are her eyes but she's elusive and we are drawn to her because,0.078572154
of the way she's framed we were drawn to her in the same ways that,0.037315473
Marianne is drawn to her it uses a lot of empty space in the film,0.05722841
but I think that it that creates the mood and it heightens the sexuality the,0.14189431
film loves silence they love to take long pauses after a line is said and,0.08435859
things like that but yet at the same time even in the midst of those,0.035397083
silences there's always that fire underneath both metaphorically and literally because often you see you,0.057364106
know a fireplace in the distance and you can hear those those cracks and the,0.029278724
snaps of the fire which you know creates again more of that erotic tension the,0.27435568
first half of the film kind of has a slow build to it it really,0.034103967
takes its time but then the second half of the film it's kind of where,0.025694048
everything's blossoming it feels like everything is flourishing and that's where a lot of the,0.024978312
surrealism comes into play and I like that I like that Marianne is the one,0.025874313
telling the story because I think that that just adds another layer of complexity to,0.021102287
it it makes the ideas of love being heightened and distorted all of that a,0.041368436
compelling thesis or at least one aspect of the thesis yes there is that complicated,0.022611588
nature of romantic love and the immediacy of it being very visceral of course but,0.08419496
then they add this whole nother idea where we're look at it through memory the,0.030877825
perceptions of memory especially sensory memory when you're recalling a love story it's the sensory,0.023777654
moments that you tend to remember the most and I think in the case of,0.02484328
all kinds of love stories we often choose the memories other than reality because it's,0.014510316
easier we want to remember the person through our own filter through our own gaze,0.032389123
because it gives us that sort of control and that's also a really interesting idea,0.02227567
that you can tie into the filmmaking process in general because it mirrors that filmmaking,0.03804252
of course is a manipulative tool as I always say and its own right I,0.0513422
actually wish that that point had been brought into play more I think that would,0.023406481
have been very interesting and I sort of like Mulholland Drive sense there are images,0.045557097
in this film that reminded me a lot of mahon Drive especially you know the,0.029607989
profile shots where they're kind of overlapping in the beginning of the film Aloise refuses,0.12929706
to pose for the portrait so her mother tells Marian well could you just maybe,0.06587912
do it in secret so basically what Marian's having to do is she's having to,0.03354787
paint her just from memory and let me tell you that's ridiculously hard to do,0.14131893
I'm an artist myself and I don't I don't think I could do that I,0.04510677
have to have a subject I have to have a reference point to make it,0.015105655
seem realistic with shadows and the way that the light is hitting the face and,0.20523244
all of that is very difficult to recreate on your own it is a skill,0.10394625
that I wish that I had so props to Mary Ann that skill works in,0.04163983
the film because it's essential to the whole idea of what it means to perceive,0.03294322
a person the memory of a person as your feelings are changing for them compared,0.027738823
to the reality and how they would be if they were there in front of,0.03008293
you and that really can't affect your creative sensibilities and I think Mary Ann you,0.03290198
know she's becoming inspired artistically as the film is going so that point of view,0.021482106
is reflected through the film as I said it becomes more surrealistic and more kind,0.041269325
of beautiful and flourish as it goes art for her is a business she's there,0.04319769
to do a job but at the same time she's finding new ways to be,0.022002945
inspired and to improve through her relationship with the subject but in love it's never,0.03406738
about just one person I mean even in a love story if one person is,0.055939283
deeply in love with somebody who doesn't have the same feelings back it's still going,0.09988663
to affect both of them very deeply typically it's not just about the subject it's,0.010438727
how you see the subject and how you are translating and that's a very personal,0.031807087
thing I think and even somebody who does realistic portraits I'm as Merion does there's,0.038034536
a vulnerability to that and there's always a piece of the artistic thing in the,0.036313705
artwork especially as you grow older there's a moment that captured that for me pretty,0.045108765
early on it's when she puts on Mary Ann she puts on the green dress,0.040429197
that Eloise is supposed to be wearing when she poses for the portrait and because,0.042972192
I Louise is not there in the beginning of the film she puts it on,0.018528026
and has a mirror and she kind of sits in place just kind of so,0.040792387
there's a body there's a figure to work off of but also there's a deeper,0.033911727
idea to that it's the idea of the artist merging with their subject or their,0.016380813
art on a less literal level and how that's going to build through the film,0.05510714
and it's since through these moments she's discovering herself and she's growing as an artist,0.075092584
until she finally in the end of the film she draws herself she draws a,0.030897781
portrait of herself but she's not doing it for a business she's not doing it,0.06845605
for herself um she's doing it for someone else she's doing it for Eloise that's,0.03615805
the moment when we realized that she's made her full evolution her full arc as,0.032484908
a character and her individuality has shifted as a result artists and muses is the,0.026415773
story here but as I mentioned before there's always a mirroring of that in terms,0.027429514
of the filmmaking process and you can also look at this on a more subtextual,0.01613802
sense you know there is muse and filmmaker because I know that in real life,0.023928652
and I didn't know this until you know after seeing the movie that the the,0.027465433
director did date to the actress who played Eloise for many years they were together,0.05401025
and I know that they are pretty sure they broke up prior to making the,0.047805417
film but even so there is a there is you know something there and even,0.026107794
before knowing this information just the way that Eloise is framed in the film you,0.04844067
can tell that the filmmaker is enamored with her she's capturing that elusive muse in,0.0349248
a very hypnotic way and therefore we are hypnotized as well and I really think,0.028257666
that Adele had now I think that's how you pronounce her name um I think,0.052347958
she's wonderful in the film she gives by far the best performance for me she,0.0350299
has a hardness to her but there is a sensuality and a playfulness as well,0.08185417
in her eyes and just very very striking there are images in the film that,0.037151836
are just so stunning especially when you have that beautiful French backdrop there are a,0.06298158
lot of images that stuck out I love the ones with three ladies and you,0.054980088
know you see their silhouettes as they're walking and that in the backdrop is that,0.031166514
gorgeous fiery sunset the image of Eloise in the darkness and she's there's a long,0.09601593
shot of her as her dress catches on fire that is another one that is,0.3287539
very forgot very dynamic sciama is very minimalistic but there is kind of a impressionistic,0.14696567
approach almost though it looks like a painting there are many intimate moments in the,0.023767676
film off and my favorite parts are the parts where characters are alone and nothing,0.074783936
is being said or just specific moments between the two women where they're very simple,0.11592554
there are no pretenses it's just a love story it's the moments person you can,0.025221769
tell some it isn't really trying to evoke something those are the moments that really,0.01189681
stick out to me as the most strong and the most the most human however,0.09955405
that kind of segues into a lot of things that I don't like about the,0.07057931
film even though there are some gorgeous images in the film and it's beautifully composed,0.015404988
and and on all of that I think that you know even if you have,0.03062439
an amazing artistic is how it clearly does I think you have it's important as,0.02544128
a viewer or at least as a critic I should say it's important not to,0.043433167
be just so intoxicated by the way something is designed and structured especially when something,0.022086093
is so aesthetically driven you have to be careful of that for me I like,0.094845876
to be also very home care of the filmmakers point of view and what they're,0.0170746
trying to say and and not being so intoxicated by the rest and when I,0.04427928
look at it from that point of view it doesn't affect me as much and,0.017636014
I find myself realizing that there are moments that stick out to me and that,0.046435807
I remember and that I'm pleased by when I think back on it but as,0.020838873
a whole the film doesn't mean that much for me I found myself wishing that,0.009887289
the story itself had more of that complexity so that it matched the richness of,0.011976631
those images that the beauty of those images that Salma is is working so hard,0.04442961
to create I don't mean to say that the film does not have passion behind,0.033972923
it because I think it does I do think it comes from a vulnerable place,0.033807293
coming from a place of having a break up and moving on and that's mirrored,0.03686381
through the story for sure but I you know so I don't think that the,0.019673472
intent is disingenuous it's it's more I don't think that sciama quite has the confidence,0.026993152
and the awareness yet as an artist to be able to to work on that,0.019454626
next level because as it stands it does feel kind of already and very lofty,0.01830652
and I think that our house filmmaking when it's done really well it's exploring all,0.022774559
sorts of aspects of art and how it is tied to the human condition in,0.0507442
a truly vulnerable way well a lot of the images are very symbolic I think,0.018333126
that they're too conscious of their symbolism in a way that just kind of it,0.04137908
puts me off a little bit and I just don't think that the that Choma,0.049794316
is quite trusting in the spontaneity of the moment and the integrity of the core,0.022936862
story yes I know that it's meant to be kind of artistically heightened and distorted,0.041445598
but there's something about it that does feel staged in a way that is you,0.02810268
know that I don't think Sam is quite conscious of and it doesn't give the,0.021547958
film true fluidity so I always felt a little bit removed from it I couldn't,0.07560278
help but think about persona directed by Ingmar Bergman while watching this film just because,0.03149445
there are so many similarities between the two films you know you have two women,0.09535208
in that film also in a house very secluded from everybody else and they're very,0.016181923
few cast members in the rest of the film it also relies on silence and,0.028748572
emptiness and beautiful images and similar ways yet persona to me excels in all the,0.14353798
areas where this one does not it's about morality in a way that really cuts,0.019298308
deeper and it's much more multi-layered and it doesn't seem to be so concerned with,0.022114696
political statements it's simply just that aspect of it is just simply a part of,0.020327346
the tapestry and part of exploring the psyche so emma has been very vocal as,0.027176078
an artist about how she does want to employ politics into the film which is,0.023715792
fine I mean there's typically going to be a political point of view whether you're,0.024549268
conscious of it or not because of the society that we live in you know,0.09117406
when you're making when you're writing a story as an artist but I think if,0.022402056
you're gonna do it really consciously it's a tricky thing for it to not come,0.08020785
off as a contrivance because when that happens that it loses its authenticity there are,0.037534982
times when that aspect of things is very pointed and and not in some crazy,0.088742815
overt way where they're just rubbing it in your face constantly but enough for me,0.34184244
to feel that it cheapens the overall effect of the film and the meaning of,0.015490796
it they talk about equality as a pleasing feeling but it doesn't feel that equal,0.051319584
to me it just seems like they're kind of dismissing males and as not allowing,0.20286106
women to do this or that and that feels trite and not particularly well written,0.27181432
to the story it loses its sincerity to the thinness of those conceits and while,0.061713077
I don't want to use the word propaganda because that's way too strong of a,0.020184333
word I think it does exist especially when you look at there's another character in,0.027372306
the film a young maid it's like a subplot young girl where she's getting an,0.15007475
abortion and you know that's fine you know whatever I think it's fine to make,0.26335984
a movie about that but it just it doesn't feel like it works it feels,0.022604937
very disjointed like something that was inserted like a you know I got a feminist,0.32077962
agenda and it didn't really contribute to the overall story for me in a way,0.022557043
that felt cohesive maybe sciama I think sees the world in quite an extraordinary way,0.07220635
but I I want more confidence in there to where she can trust in just,0.016332254
what she feels in her soul and bringing that out so we can fill all,0.115099385
those empty spaces and that those silences to truly ripen to levels where it doesn't,0.037576888
have to rely on on socio politics in a way that feels kind of uninspired,0.028610215
at times and I really don't like to talk about politics trust me it's not,0.050312497
something that I I uses the focal point of my reviews often but when you,0.03378734
have a director who is very vocal about that and who does see her film,0.031015517
as political and as a feminist work then you know I kind of have to,0.097871795
break that apart much to my chagrin and I like to think of it in,0.056623094
the sense of like what if you had a male director who only had males,0.11217657
working on his set and it was an all-male cast for the most part and,0.059760097
they only talked about women in passing in that way I definitely don't think that,0.123406865
would go over well in the liberal arts scene you need to always think about,0.02884835
that and is this feminism that you are using as part of your thesis is,0.07656197
it really a tool for equality or is it more there to defy convention and,0.042731397
I think in this case it seems to be more that second one not on,0.02834148
like a completely rudimentary level but just there enough where it to kind of annoy,0.16112876
me and I think she's better than that so yes a little muddled still not,0.13440302
quite sure what I think about it to be quite honest with you I all,0.04469635
I know is that there were moments that connected with me but just overall I,0.02170095
didn't feel it in the way that a lot of people have and a lot,0.023047948
of people have spoken to me so highly about this film the artistry of the,0.048906296
film just feels a little bit on the nose for me and not in the,0.035655838
ways I think that sama really intended for it to be at least for me,0.029058548
and you know when I look at her and when I look at this movie,0.044669077
it looks like something that a very very talented and precocious art student may just,0.03702479
after they got out of art college or whatever and so yes if it's very,0.022605602
impressive and there's like you know I'm interested to see what they do next for,0.039106146
sure but at the same time it's it is a little arty it is a,0.033124816
little embellished and it's lacking that sophistication in that maturity so a lot of the,0.076821394
the thematic elements especially the political ones and all of that they aren't into woven,0.08812951
very well but she does have a gift for sure and I want to make,0.05461956
that point I don't want people again I don't want people thinking that I I,0.06062151
hate this film or anything like that because I do think that the pieces are,0.20761313
there I just want them to come together narrative ly aesthetically all the way and,0.15114303
I am interested to see what she does next because I think that she could,0.06255454
just slowly get there and if she can get there I think she does have,0.024930418
a masterpiece Center I don't know I don't know if I want to recommend this,0.044309214
or not I think it's an interesting discussion to have and I think that if,0.020596746
you're really into films that are aesthetically driven you're going to love this film so,0.10896839
in that sense I think I would recommend it but yeah that is my review,0.035983775
