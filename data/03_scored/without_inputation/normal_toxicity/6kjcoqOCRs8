done years ago that I think still look and sound great or maybe I just,0.0795224
haven't gotten the time to do a review which brings us to the movie that,0.050428472
I just re-watched 2015's Mad Max fury road on 4k and 3d blu-ray I won't,0.08153876
be reviewing the movie itself I'm just going to be sharing with you some of,0.08998991
my thoughts on the video and the audio quality now let's just go over a,0.07493749
few tech specs the movie was shot in 2.8 K it's got a 2k di,0.1568316
it's rated R runtime is 120 minutes there's also a 3d version of the movie,0.05531196
but it wasn't shot natively so it is a 3d conversion aspect ratio is to,0.1010431
400 by 1 which means it'll have those black letterbox bars yes I watched both,0.23319559
the 4k and 3-d blu-rays and honestly I can watch this either way because they're,0.10894315
both knockout transfers as for sharpness and clarity the 4k version is the clear winner,0.049522854
environmental textures like individual grains of dirt and sand the rock formations and even the,0.24450351
clouds get a big boost over the 1080p version the close-up shots are crazy detailed,0.384874
to where you can make out the dry caked on makeup on a more and,0.15480387
Joe's face and body and those details such as wrinkles pores and scars or rendered,0.19537388
multitudes better than the standard blu-ray where the 4k really takes a big leap is,0.06513899
in the HDR department colors are highly saturated to the point you might think they're,0.040063042
overly saturated so the image tends to look a bit hot the desert shots are,0.18440309
a lot warmer coming from the regular blu-ray and those fiery explosions and flames shooting,0.32021362
from the exhausts are extremely red and overcooked the flames can come off a little,0.095783934
too CGI looking and sometimes flat what HDR does is boost the overall picture brightness,0.07462863
it's not one of those dim HDR transfers it's actually really really bright from beginning,0.15466556
to end expect to see a ton of specular and peak highlights from reflective chrome,0.09799357
surfaces explosions and anything that might look shiny black levels are extremely dark and contrasting,0.300227
and just elevates the image depth and separation and speaking of image depth the 3d,0.052375995
version while it doesn't have the same color pop or added resolution does make for,0.07178186
a fun and I think more engaging viewing experience first off the color seemed more,0.12037795
balanced without the overly cooked color grade not that anything is terribly wrong with the,0.15061569
HDR version but you might find yourself preferring the more toned down standard and 3d,0.15138608
versions I found the separation between foreground middle and background layers to reach pretty deeply,0.03615254
inwards on my projection setup the sandstorm never fails to impress as you'll see sand,0.19513874
and debris blowing right past your face there is one point in the movie where,0.19103524
Max's foot breaks the black bar barrier but other than that there's still a good,0.3136603
amount of things coming towards the screen I should also mention that there are some,0.037080936
times you get that flat cardboard cutout look I found some of the flames to,0.23980065
look at a place and some of the billowing smoke looked oddly converted audio isn't,0.055470955
you'll be Atmos for both the 4k and 3d versions and it's straight demo material,0.37123516
right from the opening you'll hear distinctly plays voices talking through different speakers there in,0.077276215
front of you to the sides behind you and you'll even hear that little girl,0.38446
whisper right above your head don't forget how crisp that lizard sounds when it's running,0.37484565
across the sand right before it gets stomped on the sandstorm is another demo worthy,0.23993771
scene with whirling effects engulfing the entire listening space but the car chases have excellent,0.1371707
front to back panning with bad guys dropping from the above channels when they're swinging,0.15408398
on those poles the roar of the engines has some crazy DB room shaking bass,0.35447967
and again that sandstorm is going to put a working on your subwoofers the sound,0.13579348
stage is cinematically wide and spacious with an intense rockin soundtrack dialogue was fine for,0.08320286
the most part although hearing max mumble can be kind of hard to make out,0.08769928
if you can't fix what's broken now when I originally reviewed this I gave the,0.08466253
movie an 8.5 for audio I've upgraded many parts to my home theater so after,0.07173046
we watching this I'm gonna have to give the audio on 9.9 this is a,0.09726688
killer mix right from the get-go it's loud it's bombastic it's got everything you'd want,0.47688383
from a Dolby Atmos mix aggressive surrounds and aggressive high channel usage and bass just,0.15537743
rocks if you've got a surround sound setup but I'm sure that you've probably already,0.09711208
got this movie in your collection for video which I previously gave an 8 it's,0.2370322
going to get bumped up to a 9.6 I think the increase in detail over,0.12369262
the regular blu-ray is a noticeable difference whether or not you like the way the,0.075355045
HDR looks well there's no denying the color pops right off the screen and those,0.167591
crazy highlights aren't quite the attention grabber for 3d video we're gonna go with the,0.37431833
9.8 I always forget this movie comes in 3d whenever I put it in for,0.07857581
a quick look I always get stuck watching the entire thing it's got some heavy,0.24060187
3d separation with a little flatness thrown in but overall for me personally I think,0.18889795
the added depth the bright 3-dimensional image and the rich color palette make this my,0.015473993
preferred way to watch this movie now no matter which way you like to watch,0.124516755
