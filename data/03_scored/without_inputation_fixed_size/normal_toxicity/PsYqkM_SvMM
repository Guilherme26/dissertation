yeah hey what's going on out of the YouTube this is SCO 0 pick to,0.13746077
0 representing JVs so this is gonna be my review for a movie that I've,0.12409545
been long overdue of watching and I'm talking about the movie Lady Bird coming-of-age story,0.16690706
this was directed by Greta gierek starring I'm gonna get her name so wrong I,0.15284924
apologize but sorry so Ross Ronan Laurie Metcalf um Lucas hedges and Timothy Shaw met,0.14886118
the ironic thing about all four do you feel that just listed either last year,0.07601995
or this year they're not made for Academy Award Timothy are Sarma is nominated for,0.06927681
the movie with Armie Hammer even though he was in this movie Lucas hedges for,0.11665274
Manchester by to see who did amazing in that and then you got Laurie and,0.0939623
this is Ronan that are nominated for Lady Bird and I gotta say their relationship,0.13660905
is so real like what I mean by that is the organic nosov how they,0.076699466
function and thrive as a mother and a daughter is something that I can sit,0.15525502
there and be like I've seen this before this seems real it's not like okay,0.1408143
we're gonna like have this Hollywood moment where this thing happens or like okay this,0.07726718
person is gonna get this epiphany and they change like I think one of the,0.13485794
most literal amazing scenes is when Lady Bird and her mom are legit going and,0.30167606
trying on dresses and Lady Bird goes trial on his pink dress she likes it,0.38642207
and her mom the first thing because our mom is like something kind of sitting,0.43290326
like is it too pink and Lady Prairie responds back why can't you just be,0.15521757
okay with it why can't you just like me and then she goes back and,0.16239144
even reiterates with it's like why don't you like me and I mean I think,0.2884415
that the movie Fitz's hit home with me son kind of the same way as,0.15047882
this one because this is for me was something that I'm I come from the,0.095856644
south I come from you know certain circumstances where I'm like man I this is,0.11213732
real these kind of conversations are seemingly real even though it's coming from a play,0.08440099
like I can see and relate to this conversation and even with these two people,0.058333028
these two amazing actresses they're able to convey something to me that I was like,0.09349235
mate because one of the things that Laurie the mom says early on and move,0.101137236
on I've know I'm kind of spoiling a little bit I apologize you should definitely,0.26460388
go check this movie out but I think that even if you see it in,0.08904153
the trailers I don't think you're gonna lose anything as far as weight behind it,0.22564073
um one of the things that she talks to her about when Lady Bird gets,0.14921676
upset with her is that she was my lady pros like you know haven't you,0.298819
ever just wanted to do this and do this as a kid like and not,0.15199552
complaining about this and like she was like my mom was an abuser and an,0.553065
alcoholic and it was like yo like and that that defines her character if you,0.19655201
don't catch this little moment everything up she does you won't pick up on you,0.13337803
won't pick up that cheese very much so a perfectionist like analytical critical highly over-critical,0.067542545
can't even really enjoy herself because she not just critical of you know labor but,0.15492022
of herself and what she does and ironic thing is that she interacts with people,0.18609631
and helps people throughout their problems like literally that's what she does you know saying,0.14436515
I'm just a nurse but she really helps people without their problems but yet she,0.124851234
does that to try to project because she's got this internal turmoil within herself and,0.081550054
and even like later on her dad even says to the baby bird like look,0.29768452
your mom loves you but your mom can't even get out from this one specific,0.74462014
situation to try to help she doesn't know how to help you net that hurts,0.15332675
her on the inside and I was like that's crazy but then the character Lady,0.4367658
Bird is even more conflicting because she's not good at anything it's like he's not,0.32304394
just like you know how I got these like superstar characters you know like alright,0.06588357
this person is gonna have this one trait it's good Act she's gonna be good,0.29822174
at writing but she's gonna be good at you know organizational skills so you gonna,0.24218597
have the same as that Kings and her mom have she any of those things,0.18211742
and what happens is because her mom is not able to reflect and let her,0.4835827
know like you are great I like you everything's good so she she touched her,0.3935844
dad but you know it's always that mother-daughter thing that shows like where you are,0.3052145
going as a woman and so for her she's a pathological liar because she has,0.8295359
to try to appease to feel at place and that sounds crazy but her friend,0.44147664
I was her friend's name oh my gosh Julie paid by a beanie Feldstein I,0.21408066
would have actually liked a little bit more of her but I like the way,0.16212761
they just kind of like ran it off they didn't give me too much because,0.093560815
that's not about you know the story has over art either way when her and,0.06500024
Julie were conversating and stuff like that like it was like it seems so organic,0.15522592
it seemed so natural but eventually she just decides the desert Julie and I go,0.08735045
and meet up with this cool girl because she wants to hang out with this,0.4658574
cool guy and then it's like expectation expectation and it's not even like peer pressure,0.15306488
it's like you need to feel like you're at place and part of that is,0.110371016
because it reflects on who she sees in herself like even when she goes and,0.1552955
like goes into the the teachers location takes the grades those enjoy sound like like,0.07082248
this is who I am and it's like yo like she has no characteristics about,0.3355634
her that makes her exceptional other than the fact that she is a realist when,0.09149318
it comes down to it like an eventual point she's like alright yeah I was,0.207908
a pathological liar like look this is this where it is but she's really just,0.8355208
figuring out that's why I mix it so well done as a story that's a,0.0805986
coming-of-age story my legit like when I got done looking at the movie those one,0.16201466
moment towards the end where Julie's mom like shuts her out you know I'm saying,0.31089434
and like Julie leaves I'm not Julie but um Lady Bird leaves and she goes,0.13429365
a circle in the car right and like that performance was oh lazy because she,0.5056275
conveyed so many emotions and she kept it in and I was this like because,0.06387916
we have seen like the parallel between the beginning of the stories like them two,0.04853915
together in the car and you know their their body hit these proximate because they're,0.31796837
already clashing but you know they love each other but he can't really talk about,0.10275625
it and like the beginning you don't say lady breathless I'm crazy I don't wanna,0.3815789
spoil it but when the mom is by her stuff and leaving she's like in,0.15312646
her heart I can feel like there goes my best friend daily goes my daughter,0.207525
there goes the person I need to protect and I can't help you know I'm,0.083949946
saying like I was I feel uneasy motion Dan later bird later on she goes,0.15076406
to this church when she gets through what she needs to be and she leaves,0.24229653
it has this conversation it's like like I'm feeling all these kind of things I'm,0.11616788
like yo I'm sitting there I go back and recount to myself and that news,0.1053331
is telling a little bit about myself I don't want I normally don't do this,0.13537635
but this movie provokes testimony in my personal opinion because you know saying when I,0.10952255
think about high school like when I went to prom for my high school I,0.14091596
didn't go with anybody I got you know invited was somebody I didn't want to,0.066377714
go with and then you know I went but I met up with the person,0.057835326
that I wanted to dance with but we didn't leave together a legit left my,0.066210836
prom and I went to the waterfront and just you know children listened to music,0.08087294
because my family situation it wasn't so much about like when I went to prom,0.106917016
like alright well it's gonna be this you're gonna have this little did I it,0.1401001
was it was a totally different family dynamic so for me to go out and,0.077338375
go to the water park what would a front and be in my car and,0.072009414
listen to music chillin like I was like I embraced that so I said they're,0.122562304
almost like I'm connected to this moment with Julie and Lady Bird I was like,0.10723006
me and I love this like when you know Lady Bird is have this conversation,0.18092263
with her mom back and forth like I can relate to these kind of conversations,0.22414532
because this is real this is like even like when she went and go away,0.3236946
to college like when I went to college you know I'm saying and I was,0.054528266
kind of just like taken back when she had this conversation I was talking to,0.09789956
her dad over the phone talking about like she's rich I talked to her mom,0.36569196
and she's talking about like her hometown and how long she drove in it for,0.15394497
the first time it was different than when she walked around they don't when her,0.107141644
mom drove away it was like she they were to set and feel all the,0.11563696
beauty and she couldn't really accept all of it until later on and I'm getting,0.1495846
to a point here but for me like I remember going to college and like,0.039090607
you know I was like man there are some beautiful things in my small town,0.15317993
that I'll miss you know saying I didn't accept it until much later you know,0.073381245
saying even now like I'm not you know it's different like it was moments like,0.06407781
I always remember and they they take part of who I am because one of,0.05321959
the biggest critical things about the the movie to me was that Lady Bird tried,0.16856602
to say I need to get away from home you know I want to be,0.24079444
this I want to be better than this person I want to be the center,0.25065693
of attention but she had no idea you know who she really is she wasn't,0.09391293
good at anything and on top of that like she alienated everybody because of her,0.2682999
pathological lying you know about everything you know I'm saying like it was like she,0.53490317
had her friend Julie and she shut her out you know she had other friends,0.37176475
but they weren't really friends there was even a moment where yo oh boy Lukas,0.1715428
huge Lukas hedges has interesting relationship with her that whole relationship would bit off of,0.24040633
a line foundation you know and then like the crazy thing I'll say that I,0.1728707
think that her mom in her do have in common I think is an asset,0.3372219
which is actually something good about Lady Bird that she probably gets from her mom,0.31089434
is that after the fact of being able to forgive I think that forgiveness is,0.048979104
something that Lady Bird can definitely be able to do as much as she bickered,0.2651425
and you know act it out did all these kind of things like the relationship,0.121781036
between Danny and Lady Bird is to me a testament of her able to forgive,0.111656144
her being able to late because the any situation that's real you don't say like,0.11408219
you never would know you know but it happened and when he broke down on,0.16657063
her I was like oh that's crazy you know and it just it feels real,0.40753442
and for me to be able to rant about this it's almost like you know,0.15439281
I took a I took a I took a detour into Sacramento California chilled and,0.07131477
just kind of like went with a camera crew and just walked around with like,0.07712313
these characters for a while and just watch their lives like the jimin in the,0.110671245
2005 the music selections like the the dress the way people dressed and the way,0.09429709
things were and even like from a Catholic school standpoint I mean I don't wanna,0.2751387
go too much into that but it's very much so accurate in my personal opinion,0.112915136
so as a film and that was able to convey how they act I can,0.06168515
see why this was definitely rated one of the highest movies this year this gave,0.06357601
me the same as X feeling that me myself me me Earl and the dying,0.325834
girl gave me emotionally as much as a coming-of-age story that you know I think,0.3790928
it's just this is an interesting Testament it's like it was to me it was,0.1068608
definitely better than manhood because her boyhood because it felt so organically real not just,0.37914115
from the standpoint of time but from what things were happening so I mean I,0.058118146
don't know what to give this a rating I don't want to just give it,0.092360154
a 10 just to say us a 10 but it can't be anything long it,0.08934859
is I'm gonna give it a range how about that nine to ten a nine,0.10423842
to attend is where this was stand I don't know I feel like over time,0.074224375
if I said yeah I looked at this on my wife she would love it,0.17382075
we would probably bring it up to a ten if I looked at this over,0.050261285
time of myself like a foggy night for five where my Steven at nine but,0.15756299
as a movie it is very good it is very well acted is very organic,0.09561538
it's very natural and I think it's very interesting that I would wait tonight which,0.11139764
is the night the sudden fit Daniel in lobes to watch this film because for,0.086995535
sure man the mom could easily get nominated for me and as well as oh,0.15075324
girl Ronan she could get nominated as well or not nominee they could both win,0.27705824
but either way I hope y'all enjoyed this review keep the lock jbi swingin on,0.119771704
