i don't know how you make a movie as bad as the last jedi it,0.18269749
takes one of the most beloved franchises of all time throws it in the trunk,0.16207683
of a car and then backs it into a river i'll probably keep going to,0.069755115
see these movies just because it's interesting to see how much money you can spend,0.12939169
setting a dumpster on fire but i definitely have no emotional investment in this terrible,0.3444008
fan fiction written by a gang of idiot children this movie fails on so many,0.9325028
levels that i don't even know if i can cover all of them in one,0.17939667
video but i'll try and real quick before any of you complain that this movie,0.113789685
came out six months ago you just got done celebrating a nlgger star wars holiday,0.25930017
so don't tell me that this isn't relevant this is a detailed analysis and i,0.062203176
had to wait for the freaking thing to come out on blu-ray so i could,0.5106688
actually pull the scenes and show you just how bad they are so yeah let's,0.40317997
just get into it number one mad libs are not good storytelling now any modern,0.30693188
star wars movie is gonna look good i mean they're sinking millions of disney dollars,0.16564569
into the special effects so the problem is not that there's not enough lasers or,0.06967705
spaceships or explosions the problem with the last jedi is that it's a narrative cluster,0.15613379
with a bunch of characters whose actions only make sense if you assume that they,0.10641871
were the type of kids who had to wear a helmet to gym class now,0.10740898
the force awakens was really bad but at least it kind of set up for,0.09339712
another movie that could have been good if the first movie is the stupid goofy,0.88824683
action adventure the second movie is the chance to start really defining your characters show,0.04219178
us that rey has some sort of weakness or trial to overcome and that this,0.0849913
trilogy is more than just the mary sue space chronicles how did you do that,0.11279186
i don't know no one treats ships but i've never left show us that finn,0.11573219
is a hero and not just a vehicle for bad jokes i'm in charge i'm,0.10864528
in charge now phasma i'm in charge bring it down and show us how our,0.24115366
favorite characters from the old movies have changed and evolved in meaningful ways but here's,0.02847093
the thing about trying to evolve your characters you should probably have some sort of,0.07895805
plan and no not a super secret plan that you don't tell anyone else about,0.1490557
see i made the mistake of assuming that jj abrams had some sort of spreadsheet,0.10165949
somewhere that said look here's who this guy is here's why she has these powers,0.2397613
here's why luke skywalker's rotten away on an island that's why i honestly did not,0.19263187
believe it when they said no ryan johnson had complete creative control to do whatever,0.07094375
the nlgger he wanted it's not true that's impossible jj wrote drafts for eight and,0.20279744
nine then ryan arrived and rewrote the last jedi entirely ryan didn't keep anything from,0.05741948
the first draft of the episode eight script so basically jj abrams invented all these,0.06977328
characters and set up all these plot threads and then told ryan johnson i don't,0.0695199
care do whatever you want they basically played star wars mad libs give me the,0.3759007
name of a character uh snoke all right now give me some adjectives uh pointless,0.45173556
irrelevant insignificant i'm sorry man but if you're gonna write an epic story that unfolds,0.31839034
over three movies you need to plan out an arc where are these characters going,0.08164351
to begin where are they going to go to and where will they end up,0.07634872
for instance in the force awakens finn's character arc starts the moment he rejects the,0.040213253
first order specifically represented in the story by the character of captain phasma and he,0.076531045
gave you permission to remove that helmet i'm sorry i can't phasma is the catalyst,0.32871562
for finn's entire character and she should be treated as more than just a random,0.06650363
bad guy if i was planning out a proper character arc i would probably revise,0.19127327
this scene where finn fights a random guy with a laser stick to flesh out,0.49393818
the character we've been selling action figures of for over a year as the first,0.052387897
battle between finn and phasma we would see the difference in their power levels finn,0.12120336
is a random grunt storm trooper with only the most basic of training whereas captain,0.16016878
phasma is a battle-hardened warrior in this first battle she will completely kick his ass,0.9460372
and he will barely escape with his life then in the second movie we will,0.106965266
have another battle between these two to show how finn has grown we will see,0.058640275
that he is no longer a scared coward but has trained himself to be a,0.603928
formidable opponent we will see that phasma's arrogance has caused her to become complacent and,0.4922521
she will be shocked to discover that her former underling can now battle her to,0.08277804
a standstill then in the third movie it all comes full circle in the final,0.067804426
battle we see that finn has reached the apex of his training he has become,0.08975411
a masterful warrior maybe he has force powers whatever whereas phasma's hate caused her to,0.32371172
grow stagnant and weak finn's virtue is what gave him the strength to fulfill his,0.21817425
destiny he will defeat phasma on the battlefield showing that good triumphs over evil and,0.31089434
completing his hero's journey but instead because we have no plan for either character this,0.052440226
is the arc first movie finn throws phasma in a trash compactor what do we,0.53490317
do with her trash compactor second movie finn hits phasma upside the head with a,0.7077291
lightsaber and maybe she dies i don't know third movie she's maybe gonna come back,0.5165933
and if she does come back i can only assume that finn is gonna whoop,0.09972166
her ass a third time then ride her around the death star like a horse,0.9327522
this lack of planning is without a doubt the biggest problem with the new star,0.17542055
wars trilogy however some idiots are saying it's actually good because it subverts our expectations,0.82461494
so yeah after this movie came out a bunch of people who thought they were,0.2567643
much smarter than they actually are wrote a bunch of articles about how the movie,0.31089434
is good because it subverts our expectations which is a stupid way of saying it's,0.6666585
unpredictable motherf if you really wanted to you could make a star wars movie that,0.83785653
ends with jar jar binks checking off on han solo's grave just because a movie,0.15651986
is unpredictable doesn't make it good when your movie is constantly throwing curveballs at the,0.21136968
audience it becomes a disorienting mess let's count em out one in a highly dramatic,0.25125465
moment rey finds luke and gives him his lightsaber but gotcha luke doesn't give a,0.10928569
nlgger and chucks it off a cliff number two a tie fighter destroys leia's ship,0.53490317
leaving her to die in space but gotcha she has floaty force powers so she,0.6102519
doesn't die number three finn and rose have to find the master code breaker no,0.06632585
other person in the galaxy could possibly handle disabling the hyper speed tracker but gotcha,0.06318699
turns out this random act just happens to be capable of doing the exact same,0.11252764
nlgger number four so they go with the tweaker dude to shut down the hyperspace,0.4062409
tracker but gotcha it's a trap number five holdo is an incapable commander who is,0.40331113
going to get everybody killed but gotcha she's actually got a super cool secret plan,0.77807546
number six snoke is an amazing and important jedi master gotcha he's just a guy,0.13989323
and now he's dead it doesn't matter number seven rey's parents oh my god we,0.43235704
have to find out who's raping no gotcha they're just they're nobody it doesn't matter,0.69542736
number eight finn's gonna die no gotcha number nine luke fights kylo ren to the,0.40555784
death but gotcha it was a force project he was a magic ghost but gotcha,0.41929573
he dies anyway and double gotcha here's the thing the i am your father reveal,0.76452726
from empire is so great because it's completely unexpected but the last jedi has so,0.06145102
many plot twists that you stop being surprised by them and just start getting annoyed,0.1958006
if you actually think it's brilliant that this movie plays out like an episode of,0.10734041
candid camera then i'm sorry you're an idiot number three believe women this purple-haired lady,0.9417227
is holdo who looks like she's about to hold an intersectional lecture on modern afrocentric,0.31089434
feminism rather than command a fleet of rebel soldiers but leia gets knocked out so,0.35204208
the liberal arts major is up to bat now real quick i want to make,0.15179741
it clear that this is not an attack on diversity space is a real big,0.1439462
place and it makes sense that it's populated by more than just weirdo aliens a,0.3189134
bunch of white people and one black guy that being said ryan johnson's attempt to,0.6046081
inject feminism into star wars has backfired horribly and here's why now first of all,0.5314148
this character obviously should have been admiral akbar or mon mothma or someone the audience,0.1900728
actually has an emotional connection to but okay we're stuck with the lesbian bookstore owner,0.6732171
the real problem however is holdo's bafflingly idiotic decision to have a special secret plan,0.8593607
for no reason whatsoever tell us that we have a plan even when poe threatens,0.111068554
mutiny and takes holdo prisoner all she says is uh well okay not much i,0.44216463
can do about that guess you're in charge now popo no all she needs to,0.3673603
do in that moment is say to po listen motherfu let's sit on down we'll,0.7686393
have some green milk and i will tell you about the secret plan so you,0.11258108
stop trying to commit high treason now here's the thing what is the moral of,0.161371
the flawed interactions between holdo and poe the most obvious moral is to be subservient,0.29073736
to authority and blindly trust your superiors now i don't know about you but that,0.24108714
sounds like something the bad guys would say i wonder if a bunch of people,0.37249735
just carrying out orders ever resulted in something bad oh yeah however the real moral,0.13861047
is the ultimate exercise in jamming politically correct politics into a kid's movie with all,0.15378143
the subtle nuance of a bad guy literally named general grievous see poe thinks he's,0.41267166
a better leader than holdo because he's a man so he starts mansplaining look at,0.24823338
this mansplaining such a mansplainer but what he really should have done is trust women,0.5583786
you know no matter what it doesn't matter what the situation even if it seems,0.10744332
like that particular woman is about to get you and everyone you love incinerated by,0.5154597
a million lasers just trust her she knows what's best she is living her truth,0.15264192
hashtag me too hashtag time's up in summary an assortment of differently colored people holding,0.3205856
hands under a rainbow awesome i'm totally down with that everybody getting killed because they,0.6029908
didn't trust women enough jesus christ number four hyperspace is broken all right so star,0.4200633
wars is a shared universe right there's books graphic novels video games all sorts of,0.08926254
nlgger so when you're contributing to a shared universe you have to be really careful,0.49281475
about changing the rules of that universe because it changes it for everything the victorians,0.07151272
are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells if you tell me,0.19783777
that spider-man is a transsexual werewolf all the spider-man now has to deal with your,0.85999686
horrible creative decision with that in mind let's talk about how ryan johnson has the,0.26292208
concept of hyperspace forever hyperspace used to be a pretty simple concept your ship isn't,0.091443345
just traveling really fast because then you would smash into planets with the force of,0.31089434
a nuclear bomb no you enter like a different dimension and then pop out a,0.45755443
wormhole somewhere else but ryan johnson believes that hyperspace is just going really fast so,0.111454725
fast that a mid-sized cruiser traveling at hyperspace can apparently destroy not only the flagship,0.13864195
of the first order but like a couple star destroyers as well what the nlgger,0.4460996
now i don't read star wars books but as far as i can tell hyperspace,0.15096411
has been around for like tens of thousands of years and if you know anything,0.15032713
about technology in the real world every time we invent something the military tries to,0.06104422
figure out whether or not it can be used as a weapon so you're telling,0.11823137
me that this purple-haired lady is the first person to recognize that you can just,0.11590078
launch a ship at hyperspace and basically kill anything if that's the case everybody should,0.60704684
just immediately start building empty ships and then just launch the ships at each other,0.1541201
like missiles and again this ruins the shared universe of star wars because any time,0.20701501
from now on that there is a big epic space battle i'm gonna be sitting,0.13061546
there going uh why don't you just hyperspace like one of your ships at the,0.18654792
i mean this ship's about to get blown up anyway might as well just hyper,0.18995698
space it at them come up with some other way that this happens if you,0.11262166
told me that it was like a suicide run and she had to get nose,0.35951412
to nose with the first orders battleship in order for this to work i'd be,0.24231619
like okay at least it's like a super risky maneuver you can't just be like,0.111594275
a mile away and go all right hyperspace button boom solved not to mention man,0.14713882
i know it's supposed to be sad that the purple haired lady died but i,0.23996948
don't care this character was dumb i'm glad she did one useful thing before she,0.77507555
died number five spinny death stick man this fight scene is terrible it's hard to,0.27986774
follow it's messy and they didn't even take the time to nail the choreography watch,0.09736068
this guy okay not only is there no tactical reason to be spinning around in,0.242399
a sword fight unless you really want your opponent to see your back so they,0.36062363
can stab you in it but okay this guy spins around and he's coming in,0.7468974
at the death angle all he has to do is follow through on the swing,0.31153056
and rey will die right here daisy ridley is supposed to already be ducking but,0.5154597
because she missed her cue he changes the trajectory he's like oh nlgger i'm gonna,0.46913236
hit her uh over the head no one will notice it's so obvious he's the,0.6652697
one closest to the camera and i get that they wanted to do it as,0.06122594
one big shot without any cuts or close-ups but oh it's real bad you can,0.33910507
look at the monitor while you're filming and be like this isn't gonna work we,0.05833728
need to revise this goofy spin around missed the girl by a million miles guy,0.55377775
is not a dynamic character number six stop trying to be marvel this movie needed,0.118070275
to stop making so many stupid jokes i mean come on don't take the epic,0.8442602
climax of the last movie and turn it into a goof oh look he doesn't,0.36311796
even want the lightsaber he threw it off a cliff that's hilarious oh man how,0.25524905
about some of your mom jokes leia has an urgent message for him about his,0.44302362
mother ha ha here's the thing they want the movies to be fun and jokey,0.3811488
because that's what the marvel movies do and they're really popular but the marvel movies,0.059702225
do that because superheroes are already a ridiculous concept you know grown men and women,0.7093121
wearing ridiculous costumes beating the crap out of each other first time all of us,0.80556196
were in our suits and and none of us could get over this wall occasionally,0.09219919
you can get away with making a completely serious superhero movie but it's easier to,0.082158975
just make a bunch of jokes and admit that the whole superhero thing is dumb,0.69542736
but there's nothing inherently dumb about star wars it's just a space epic with people,0.5876557
flying spaceships and hitting each other with laser swords the audience isn't going into it,0.34419712
being like this is ridiculous and stupid and you need to write a bunch of,0.84031737
jokes so they know not to take the movie too seriously i don't know i,0.10234399
want to take star wars seriously i want an epic adventure like the original star,0.24571098
wars movies i didn't buy a ticket to see a bunch of wacky antics do,0.5577825
you have something a cow or something you can put on number seven rose sucks,0.88739425
i hate to nlgger on all the lady characters in this movie but man rose,0.4461284
is just terrible i'll say this whoever plays her seems like a very nice lady,0.33113936
and someone who deserves a much better script than the one she was handed for,0.09938767
most of the movies she's just kind of an annoying idealistic idiot who keeps dropping,0.94992846
cartoon morals about how saving animals is good and slavery is bad there's only one,0.2497993
business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich you know real deep themes but,0.09929203
then we get to the epic scene with the batarang ram laser probably the coolest,0.25611612
looking scene in the whole movie and finn is about to go randy quaid not,0.15979716
crazy but i mean like an independence day and smash into the death laser sacrificing,0.6101194
himself to save everybody i was blown away i was like wow ryan johnson has,0.17908049
some balls it was actually the first time i felt any emotion watching any of,0.6046117
these movies but then in the back of my head i'm like what's what's the,0.18746403
trick there's going to be a trick it's ryan johnson he keeps doing it what's,0.0775129
the bam the dummy lady just smashes right into a spaceship she's like what's gonna,0.70101225
save us is love and i'm like what what is this dumb talking about and,0.768615
the laser's about to kill everybody whatever is left of the resistance you have put,0.57617843
at they're gonna die because of you because of you everyone is dead the scene,0.66931325
isn't sentimental or cute this is a war zone and remember this is the same,0.10792806
girl who zapped to finn with a taser because he was about to abandon his,0.31089434
duty to the resistance her sister gave her life in service of the resistance and,0.28593126
now suddenly she's like you know what loyalty to your comrades is irrelevant it's all,0.25798136
about love baby as much as i hate to say it let the black guy,0.6981542
die for all the talk of subverting our expectations that would have actually been a,0.5876557
radical creative decision i would respect number eight go re-watch empire now most star wars,0.2272158
fans will tell you that empire strikes back as their favorite one because it's dark,0.12630756
and weird it doesn't have a happy ending it ends with the characters basically completely,0.15428647
han solo's a brick luke's hand got cut off the worst bad guy in the,0.41045636
whole thing turns out to be everybody's dad this is a perfect place for the,0.097676024
second movie in your trilogy to go the heroes have reached their lowest point and,0.1506683
must now battle their way back up it's interesting that's what i thought was happening,0.09775791
in the last jedi but i don't know what's going on now didn't everybody die,0.17696978
didn't the entire resistance get reduced to like 12 people aboard the millennium falcon so,0.109265834
why is everybody smiling and patting each other on the back all your friends are,0.18238516
dead i know you're all excited that you inspired eight-year-old boys around the universe but,0.40310666
come on this should be the shot at the end of the movie everybody watching,0.48343328
as the millennium falcon takes off and wondering if rey's new rock moving powers are,0.06445972
really going to be enough to save the day the emotional tone of this ending,0.117186144
makes absolutely no sense stop smiling stop hugging you're nlgger number nine all of your,0.548315
heroes are dead i don't understand the point of bringing back all our favorite characters,0.15763502
and showing us that they're sad old failures who asked for this let me be,0.40773997
very clear this character is not luke skywalker even mark hamill knows that this character,0.2234864
is not luke skywalker and was trying to tell people about that until disney told,0.050941247
him to shut his nlgger mouth who is this guy how did the most optimistic,0.80930126
hopeful character in the galaxy turn into this hermit that's not what a jedi does,0.08423209
i mean a jedi is optimistic and jodah is has tenacity he never gives up,0.1623905
luke skywalker is supposed to represent hope remember the name of that star wars movie,0.095513776
a new hope that was referring to luke hope is an emotion about optimism positivity,0.036244627
not giving up even when it seems like all is lost not bro i'm an,0.09773073
old man and everything sucks now it would be one thing if he started off,0.794439
the movie like an angry old man and then slowly rediscovered hope and returned to,0.4645463
his old ways but that never happens at the end of return of the jedi,0.1398004
we see the real luke skywalker he's hanging out with ewoks having a good time,0.22200671
with his buddies says goodbye to his two dads and kermit the frog or whatever,0.2404942
that's luke skywalker smiling having a good time full of hope after this moment we,0.03975921
never see the real luke skywalker again remember that even when luke confronted his father,0.079588264
who was the most evil guy ever just just pure evil he still had that,0.65256315
hope he went listen dad i know there is good in you the emperor hasn't,0.0813693
driven it from you fully that's the essence of luke's character and yet when he,0.060837843
faces kylo ren he basically tells him nlgger you there's no hope for you you,0.4476962
lose you suck he taunts him as a failure he humiliates him see you around,0.9017284
kid it's the complete opposite of what luke skywalker is this is the moment that,0.11734139
he should reaffirm everything he's about say what he said to his father i know,0.15342471
that there's good in you i have hope for you but no instead he's just,0.14077316
a cocky arrogant nlgger brushes off his shoulder dies on a rock and that's it,0.8381846
this horrible old man who was pretending to be luke skywalker is dead who cares,0.7884114
number 10 to live and die in disney here's the thing i'm not broken up,0.35569254
that star wars sucks now whereas once it was the unique vision of a driven,0.62249184
young director it is now the property of a publicly traded company mostly concerned with,0.038403615
how many toys they can sell use the force link to activate real movie phrases,0.080522805
the darkness guides me which again is fine everybody loves toys i'm just not sure,0.15099245
that obsession with generating obscene amounts of money is ever gonna lead us to another,0.17639014
great star wars film the fact that they're pumping out one of these movies every,0.15617393
year feels almost exploitative what would the last jedi have been like if there was,0.10914781
another year to write a decent script or take some time to really plan out,0.05976437
the characters sadly we'll never know this is the movie we got and it's bad,0.080021374
