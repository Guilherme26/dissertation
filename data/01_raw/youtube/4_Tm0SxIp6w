[Music] so you have a wonder woman sequel for me yes sir i do so we're gonna start the movie with diana as a kid back in themyscira okay okay and what's she up to well she's competing in the amazon version of that tv show wipeout and she tries to use a shortcut to win and learns that cheating is wrong sure okay that's a nice quick message to start the movie off it's gonna take a full 11 minutes oh my god so then we're going to jump forward to the 1980s which is when this movie takes place okay okay so like 30 40 years ago oh i don't enjoy that that's a true thing so anyway diana is still super heartbroken about steve trevor dying in the first movie he's all she can think about really after all that time yeah well i mean you gotta understand this was a really good guy she knew for a couple of days seven decades ago well yeah i guess so so anyway diane is working in washington dc at the smithsonian and she has a new co-worker named barbara what's her deal oh she's a freaking nerd sir she can't even walk in heels oh embarrassing disgusting and pathetic i bet nobody likes her yeah and so there's this artifact called the dream stone and that's what this movie's going to focus on oh what's this thing dude oh this thing's freaking nuts it grants wishes but it takes something in return a very magical stone and this phony business guy max lord he gets his hand on it and he wishes to become the dreamstone oh so he turns to stone you would think so the way that was phrased but no now he can grant people's wishes when they touch him and he can take something in return do barbara and diana get wishes in before he does that they do barbara wishes to be more like diana so she gets some nice clothes and some super strength and now she can walk in heels now that's impressive am i right yeah she's not pathetic anymore also she removes her glasses which as you know makes people automatically more attractive that's just good character development is what that is and so diana's gonna wish for steve trevor to come back to life and this way we could get chris pine back in the movie oh people like chris pine so what does he just appear out of thin air actually no his consciousness goes into this random guy's body so everybody sees this random guy but we see chris pine okay is this because the stone can't make things just magically show up no it absolutely can a giant wall is going to appear out of nowhere so are some nukes i mean the thing is magic why are we doing this weird body control thing with steve i don't know what happens to this guy's consciousness while steve's controlling his body who's to say you are yeah what if this guy has a job and a family he has to get to the implications are insane where is his consciousness is he dead oh well here's the thing sir i'm gonna need you to get all the way off my back about this body control thing get off of it oh that felt vaguely threatening so i'm gonna get off your back about that great and so then steve and diana obviously they get intimate because you know they love each other they do that using a stranger's body that's got that's got to be crossing a line that's not okay yeah well we're going to have them do it anyway and i find it strange that you immediately got back on my back about that i mean it's actually a really easy fix just have steve trevor show up as himself no so then that max lord guy makes himself super rich and he goes to egypt to take some guy's oil and make himself even richer okay so steve and diana they gotta get over there you know how are they gonna do that well the thing is they can't just take a commercial flight because steve doesn't have a passport no i mean the guy he's possessing probably has one yeah well they don't check for that they head to the smithsonian and steal one of the jets from over there they have operational jets at the museum they do yeah fully fuel jets just lying around so they take one of those because steve was a pilot okay he was a pilot in world war one these are those those are different planes well i mean a plane is a plane that's i mean okay yeah that sentence is not technically wrong so there you go but okay sir a plane is a plane are you implying that a plane's not a plane because a plane is a plane i mean that's just such a vague general statement a plane is a plane okay so then they're being chased because of the jet theft and so wonder woman goes ahead and makes it invisible and that's how she gets her invisible jet what how well turns out that's a thing she can do so she does the thing that she can do well thank god she has that ability we never once mentioned a reference it works out great so they go to egypt and they have a big chase scene with max lord oh very exciting but he freaking gets away and he goes around causing a bunch more chaos then he goes to see the president of the united states what for well he gets the president to wish for more nukes and then he sees this technology just lying around in the oval office and it's exactly what he needs what do you mean what's this device that lets him take over everybody's screen around the world so technically through like satellite waves he is you know he's touching them how i don't worry about it okay it won't so then there's gonna be this fight in the white house and barbara she's turning evil so she gets in on that too okay and steve manages to grab max lord oh and so he wishes for everything to go back to normal oh yeah no that would have been smart instead he pushes him around a bit also a decent strategy yeah so then max lord escapes and he heads off to the satellite island to do his broadcast wow wow wow and steve and diana find out that everybody needs to renounce their wishes or else civilization's gonna end so they have this big emotional goodbye oh very sad very sad but then she starts to fly and lasso some lightning bolts so that's pretty cool that's that's not bad oh sure yeah that may as well happen so then diana's gonna have to fight barbara who by the way is a cat now what yeah she's a cat now she's part cheetah what are you talking about well see max lord was like hey anything else you want and she's like yes actually i would like to be an apex predator please so she could have just as easily been turned into a killer whale yeah i guess there was a chance she could have turned into a you know orca whale but that would have made for a less interesting fight scene oh i wholeheartedly disagree anyway so then we're gonna have a barely visible fight scene and barbara's gonna get electrocuted oh so she dies oh no she gets a little sleepy which is what happens when cats get electrocuted that's not no i don't think that's accurate well that's what my dad told me when my childhood cat chewed through his extension cord that your cat died i think no sir he went to sleep then he went to live on a farm and i never saw him again i mean okay so what happens next oh well max is granting wishes to everybody in the world through their screens most of the world doesn't speak english okay yeah i'll keep that in mind for trivia night i guess that's interesting anyway it's gonna be complete chaos oh it is yep people are killing each other with wishes one guy gets a farm outside his apartment people can wish for anything really yeah it's gonna be nuts statistically speaking wouldn't at least one person wish for the guy that just showed up on their tv to die or for the world to end wouldn't at least one person wish for world peace what happens with that paradox well i mean that's got that's like a one in a million kind of wish right there are billions of people in the world you're just full of fun trivia tonight so anyway diana has to lasso this guy but her lasso can't get through this mysterious wind around him oh wow it's gonna be tough for her to defeat him if she can't reach him actually it's gonna be super easy barely an inconvenience oh really yeah see she gets her lasso around his ankle and then she can talk to everybody through him i thought she couldn't get through with that thing oh yeah no she couldn't but then she could but how unclear well okay then so then she tells everybody to renounce their wishes because nothing good comes from lying and everybody does it everybody does it including max lord who suddenly cares about his son that he's been actively ignoring the whole movie and so what about like what if someone with a terminal illness wished to be cured oh well they would have they would have to renounce that because that's that's not the truth uh what if a blind person wished to be able to see that's uh that's that's a shortcut uh to being able to see so that's that's wrong what if somebody wished to be able to feed their starving child yeah okay this moment only works if everybody wishes for something selfish or violent so we're gonna have to pretend like that's the case okay oh pretending is tight okay let's do it okay thank god so then max lord is gonna go reunite with his son who just kind of comes running out of the woods for no reason how did max lord get back from the island if he renounced all his wishes unclear and what happens with barbara well she's not a cat anymore and she's she's chilling i imagine okay anyway then diana's gonna have a little flirty moment with the guy who steve was controlling it's gonna be very sweet he's already seen that guy naked yeah just a real sweet moment it's gonna be christmas too yeah i don't know if it being christmas makes it better and then she looks at a balloon and we're all done so what do you think i mean i feel like using a strange man's body is just so deeply strange and raises so many messed up questions right right right well maybe nobody will think of how weird it is well yeah i guess that is a possibility okay let's do it hey guys ryan here thanks for watching that pitch meeting i hope you liked it if you did you know press
