today we're talking about the film ladybird first I'm gonna look at this screenplay second the cinematography third I'm gonna take the things that I noticed and apply it to a scene of my own and fourth lemma to show you guys how I did it this screenplay gives us an excellent understanding of the rollercoaster that is in some way reminiscent of each audience members coming-of-age story this is relatability that helps us empathize with the characters it also emphasizes the profound moments by contrasting them with the small petty scenes that surround them take a look at these two examples notice how the first scene is made all the more profound by the scene that follows it well you can't be scary and more I think you can your mom is your gay can you not tell anyone please I'm so sorry about everything I'm so ashamed of all of it it's just it's going to be bad and I just need a little bit of time to figure out how I'm going to tell my mom and dad this is good maybe you should have looked at it's only half an hour away less if you're driving fast to undergraduate school they're not the smart people go to Davis felt Berkeley had to accept me you and Miguel went there I'm a legacy not if we don't give money and you get bad grades what do you know about it meaning nothing third this screenplay is an excellent example of show rather than tell [Music] [Music] you the cinematography of this film was meant to feel like a series of photographs capturing memories from her gross childhood take a screen grab from nearly anywhere in the film and it could go right in your photo album this film had a very simple style of cinematography and I think it fit very well with the story the story was about real life and the cinematography felt like it the whole film was shot on a tripod and dolly with one hand held shot and no Steadicam which i think is pretty interesting for a film shot in the 21st century when there's so much big cinematic movement also to note the focal lengths all seem very normal there wasn't anything extremely wide or extremely telephoto this gave the film a really human feel now think about what this movie might have looked like if Michael Bay I'm not going to punish you oh why not it was a sister cheetah and I drove all the way home before we noticed people were talking really to be fair I wasn't just married to Jesus it's been 40 years well he's a lucky guy so after looking in the film here's my take on the style of Lady Bird hey how's it going what you're doing you're so annoying do you want I just want to talk to you what do you want I just want to talk to you you don't ever just want to talk what do you want you never talked to me all I want is for us to communicate the only communicating you do is between you and your cereal yeah it's seriously good you know what I'm done have fun with your cereal oh wait it's mine I'd pay for that so with this shot I basically want to see how well I could replicate the dynamic range basically had a few options blows off number one I could have raised the ambient light in the room to match that of the outdoors with my prosumer lights and the high ceilings this wasn't really an option a second I could have decreased the life in the window I could have done this with sheets of nd now I didn't have an in hand but we've used this in the past on other productions and it's been pretty effective my guess on how big did this one set was by pushing some extra light into the ceiling and then adding flags in the foreground to keep the light off the actors my impromptu solution was cutting the light slightly but the shears and then allowing the window to be overexposed by a stop or two afterwards I realized I could have taken the exposure down on all three shots because the foreground and the original scene is actually pretty dark second I wanted to duplicate how a lot of the dialogue scenes were shot in this film first a wide 50/50 and then two over the shoulder shots third was the color grade here's the shot before new color grading first I took her still from the movie scene and then I dropped into my timeline in the color panel I went down to the color wheels and matched tab I clicked on comparison view and that's at the comparison to the frame from the video I wanted to match next I clicked apply match and waited for it to analyze make any adjustments you want from there finally I jumped over to the effects window and edit effect noise at 3% strength to make the footage look like it could have been shot on film and that's it good good it's serious yeah it's seriously good
