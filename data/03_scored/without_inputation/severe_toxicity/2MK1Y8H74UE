welcome back to my channel today on my channel I'll be reviewing a quiet place,0.07680277
a quiet place is a 2018 American horror film directed by John Krasinski from a,0.0016677039
screenplay by Brian Wood Scott Beck and Krasinski based on a story by Woods and,0.02086016
Bek the film follows a family who must live their life in silence while hiding,0.16761097
from creatures which hunt exclusively by sound despite all the film's praise I tried my,0.043978617
best to keep my expectations low this was mostly because I was fearing it turning,0.023473
into another don't breathe scenario where everyone loves it so hard that I'm expecting something,0.095377356
amazing and then when I finally get to watch it I end up hating it,0.253011
with a fiery passion that being said there were many things I enjoy about this,0.06345386
film though ultimately I was not nearly as enamored by it as much as the,0.035351183
public seemed to be from the moment the film began I found its filming choices,0.010162676
quite for hitting I knew I was going into a film that moreso the time,0.15403658
was going to lack sound but even though I knew this I wasn't expecting the,0.020316703
extent in many films even when there is an absence of dialogue there is still,0.033290446
background noise or even a score to keep the audience engaged when this film begins,0.027810663
there is nothing it is so quiet I honestly felt something was wrong with the,0.05520226
copy I was watching but everything was just fine it was impressive to see how,0.021849953
far in they were willing to go and how far they would take the concept,0.0181655
the slightest noise even so much as a pin dropping means death and for that,0.2021034
reason they take every precaution to avoid any and all sound watching this inaction was,0.035546083
deafening it was a shock to my senses and made me very uncomfortable which meant,0.08160074
it was doing its job and for that reason I was hooked when the film,0.029255442
surprises you with the burst of sound you feel the level of alarm and panic,0.06706781
and induces and it is perfectly acted out in our performers faces that instant feel,0.047623824
where your mind races with all the ways this moment could turn out but the,0.10788281
most important being will you survive I felt these moments were inserted very smartly and,0.16087267
sporadically they weren't one after another which would have been overkill and not fit the,0.04076445
tone of the film the cinematography I found was quite simple but in this case,0.032363847
simple works perfect for what maybe is you're already doing something incredible when it comes,0.058992475
to sound you're so strongly focused on how to utilize one sense that I think,0.036703505
if they had amped up the visuals it would have just become a sensory Emily,0.041682404
Blunt for me is the standout performer of this film while I felt everyone did,0.03710328
a phenomenal job she of course took it to a whole other level there is,0.024494722
a lot of range to her character fear pain determined protective loving and seeing her,0.027781395
act out each of these things was just incredible I was truly blown away by,0.05228277
what she brought to this film as for Millicent Simmons while her breakthrough role was,0.034096647
in 2017 so wonderstruck her role in this film and what this film represents when,0.05845501
it comes to the hearing impaired community is a breakthrough all in itself it's really,0.057924192
great to see minority Act as being given more roles and what I liked in,0.022467243
this film is that usually when you see an actor with an impairment on screen,0.050123584
the character is very obviously part of the minority and they stand out from everyone,0.020294754
else and are almost depicted as abnormal but amidst despite her condition she's not depicted,0.036819246
as abnormal at all due to the circumstances she's very much like everyone else while,0.124692
she can't hear and doesn't speak she's not made to feel different because no one,0.06368468
else is able to speak and therefore there is nothing to hear most of the,0.01450699
time I found that quite interesting to witness I was surprised by how many people,0.024755474
were killed in this movie I honestly wasn't expecting everyone to die I was thinking,0.52807045
it would be one of those movies where it's all about the suspense and the,0.027863212
anticipation of death but no actual death so when it happens I was quite stunned,0.17088768
and again impressed however I was not impressed with the creatures themselves and I did,0.019666154
feel we were exposed to them true soon and that took away a lot of,0.029025288
the suspense for me I felt their appearance was true over the top for a,0.042914324
film with such a simple style the final confrontation with them did remind me a,0.08563641
fair bit of signs you think everyone screwed but in the last second they figure,0.252383
out the one thing that can kill them that no one was able to figure,0.6024689
out their appearance I was expecting something I'd never seen before that these creatures honestly,0.09141952
look like a venom and the truth fairies from Hellboy had a baby so because,0.16707684
it felt reminiscent of another I wasn't very impressed by them there was some what,0.030082265
I would consider convenient plot points that were inserted into the film and I personally,0.16673693
find it aggravating when anything is done for the sake of convenience especially in a,0.042701464
horror movie it just lowers the quality for me because it feels lazy for example,0.09600729
the scene with the nail I felt was unnecessary we already have the character going,0.028803118
into labor and trying to be quiet about it which is next to impossible and,0.11814726
this was Blunt standout moment of the film for me I imagine that's much like,0.022341523
what Scientology is like point is this moment was stressful enough and I'm sure could,0.034336116
have still led to making noise so the addition of the nail bit I was,0.039365567
unimpressed with the silo scene I felt again added an unnecessary moment to the film,0.040090617
the entire circumstances of the film are intense and dangerous enough so inserting this scene,0.10720499
that was about how can we up the danger factor again I felt was pushing,0.027052354
it my other issue was found in the final scene when they realized the creatures,0.05340959
weakness and they use it to fight back this I also found a bit convenient,0.06913653
I'm not sure how all the scribbles on the walls and the newspaper articles everywhere,0.07990585
allowed her to piece together what their weakness was and how she could utilize it,0.0666953
she did seem to figure that out abnormally fast and piece it together in a,0.025947483
way I just don't understand so while the logic of what their weakness is I,0.03720904
think is perfect and makes total sense how they discovered it in that moment I,0.025612896
didn't find believable I'm also trying to piece together where the creatures come from from,0.020510938
the newspaper clippings I assume they appeared from a meteor or asteroid that was mentioned,0.065123476
but I'm not sure if so that would again make them aliens and would once,0.114027776
again remind me of science overall there was a lot that I was impressed with,0.028347466
and I am certainly blown away with how this film uses sound and the absence,0.07213251
of sound to create a story and how they depicted it was incredible and as,0.014064643
I mentioned the performances were stellar but there are still things about this film I,0.014672621
was not impressed with it being a horror film I never felt scared or even,0.06190465
really felt that suspenseful and when moments reminded me of other films what little suspense,0.03864584
I was feeling was instantly diminished so these elements had zero impact on me I,0.09593744
honestly only jumped once and it was because the dad popped up out of nowhere,0.14327191
prior to seeing it I felt a sequel was ridiculous having now seen it I,0.23246142
do see how the ending lends itself to a sequel but I personally don't feel,0.1656733
it needs one after the success of this I don't believe a sequel will match,0.04880785
what this has done and will just end up as another staple that is there,0.031116625
to make money but contributes absolutely nothing ultimately still a solid film thank you so,0.025618218
much for watching this video if you liked it don't forget to hit that thumbs,0.1490018
