in many ways Star Wars the last Jedi is the perfect Star Wars movie not,0.025498485
just from a fan's perspective but also from Disney's because it becomes crystal clear that,0.008250273
this franchise is never going anywhere literally so much happens and yet nothing happens there,0.012969751
are so many deaths and yet nobody dies basically at the end of the movie,0.1081695
you realize for as much fun as you had watching it although I don't know,0.0739937
if everybody's gonna have that experience we'll get to that but even I who loved,0.023606703
every minute of it well almost every minute of it but still I even had,0.024909131
to realize that we were at the exact same place that we were when the,0.024130868
movie started and that's unfortunate or is it if these movies keep making so much,0.03437403
money I mean to be honest I predict that casual fans will fall away because,0.031796444
of the episodic nature that's taking over get it episode 8 of infinity episodes but,0.027539268
there are so many Star Wars fans from hardcore to casual that I think it,0.02655147
will continue to do very healthy business anyway I mean I'll keep watching them if,0.040476426
they're this good so on that note what exactly did I love about the movie,0.022938859
alright so it's a long list yay first the movie is very much a Saturday,0.022763915
morning cartoon like it took me a couple of moments to understand the tone I,0.07004118
was like what are you doing you're crazy like general Hux this is a non-spoiler,0.2911112
review so I can't give anything away but let's just say the movie starts with,0.017343333
general Hux and at first I was like this is horrible but then I realized,0.056882516
what they were doing and I was like this is fabulous accepting what the franchise,0.032340564
is but they're turning the episodes into not the spin-off movies but the episodes once,0.020382557
you accept that it's a lot of fun right so next up boy is this,0.04659944
movie funny it's surprisingly funny remember in the force awakens when the stormtroopers were walking,0.032974485
down the hall and they saw that kylo Ren was throwing a temper tantrum and,0.059559878
they turned around and walked way more of that but just so much more of,0.018263947
that and I loved it like Undercover Boss kind of humor to some degree and,0.04842138
by that I mean not just clever but almost in some ways self-aware what you,0.09044768
I loved I don't know how all Star Wars fans or other people are gonna,0.05283687
feel about it but it was perfect for me but also by extension there's a,0.040822987
very strong focus on average joes that populate this world and I love me some,0.04154604
average Joe moments they're my favorite thing and more than anything they make me feel,0.042895697
like I could be a part of this world so I thought that was great,0.050359722
it's like there are no small parts in Star Wars I thought that was fabulous,0.056251254
there are also a couple of great battle sequences in the movie and will some,0.021335766
people find battle sequences boring I am NOT one of those people like if you,0.071910344
loved the big battle secret sequence at the end of rogue one then you will,0.041158237
love this movie because this is definitely an extension of that I mean I could,0.043910768
watch x-wing formations all day long I would love to pilot an x-wing now next,0.08313133
there are also some stunning visual moments here and one in particular that was heightened,0.017469052
by an audience members response in fact it instantly became one of my best movie,0.019014275
going experiences of all time and I will tell you about it in the spoiler,0.03485629
review I wish that this person could be in every one screening to say what,0.04905064
she did at that moment because it would make the movie better for everybody it,0.052386537
was great alright then next although I have to say for the most part you,0.038030546
could hear a pin drop in the theater people were paying rapt attention but also,0.058912653
I really enjoyed the practical effects which made the porks and some other characters that,0.026804905
we can't talk about have the quaint cozy factor that so many characters did in,0.016334916
the original trilogy I mean you knew they were puppets but I know that was,0.08834437
great and I and I love porks by the way I went in hating porks,0.08055241
but now I hope that they never ever go away and by the way I,0.118487164
would like to say that of all the merch that I've seen so far the,0.05878494
copious pork merch none of it has captured the fabulous essence of the porks so,0.08981576
I hope they keep working on it because I'd like to buy something with a,0.0356146
poor guy on it now but I haven't seen anything that would again captures the,0.0571732
spirit of the porks from the movie they're so funny now what did I what,0.06413568
did I not like personally right wasn't anything that I didn't like about the movie,0.028113987
or a Myka saying only other people are gonna have problems no I'm afraid I,0.04849987
had some problems Jim as I said nothing really happens so it's difficult for me,0.042456675
I know some people who aren't really into Star Wars and they didn't like the,0.016435357
force awakens and that that bro Guan was a little boring I know right how,0.11097259
could you find although the beginning rogue one once you've seen it a couple times,0.040403254
you start to understand where people are coming from but anyway it's hard for me,0.13282454
to recommend this movie to them cuz I'm like I think you might be bored,0.09566871
but I don't see how you could miss it either but also the pacing is,0.013722073
off like two thirds in even I was like dude I love what you're doing,0.055276096
here but it's taking you way too long and then on that note I think,0.04490655
it was a mistake I don't want to give too much away but I think,0.036384214
it was a mistake I'll just say this for the rebels to basically be parked,0.08336148
for most of the movie and the rebels come across is pretty incompetent by the,0.16883159
way like wow they got a really step up their game they're starting to embarrass,0.11857564
themselves however I would like to add though that I'm amazed that self-sacrifice and war,0.21566917
has become such a big part of Star Wars after rogue one and now the,0.036229227
last Jedi that is such a complex adult sophisticated concept and it's crazy that family-friendly,0.116363235
Star Wars from Disney would become the franchise that best embodies that and promotes that,0.02600735
I mean it makes her some of the most emotional emotional gut punches of the,0.176871
movie I mean they work their earned they're not cheating they really I was amazed,0.056465443
by them in fact however it does seem that that's the rebels only strategy and,0.04710232
considering the real world history of that from kamikaze Flyers to what's happening across the,0.037606157
globe today like ripped from the headlines I would just be really careful about romanticizing,0.044130277
that Star Wars you have your moments you didn't cheat you earn them but let's,0.03813764
maybe move in a different direction okay especially because they keep doing it again and,0.029486261
again and again as for the characters though I think the Kathleen Kennedy you know,0.013548461
she's really been championing women in Star Wars and trying to really push them in,0.27669388
the mythology right and she's been a little heavy-handed about it but I can say,0.08893372
with the last Jedi that she finally found a balance in the force between female,0.06436184
and male characters and a lot of that has to do with Rey and kylo,0.021297185
Ren I liked them both a lot here and we have so much to talk,0.02862751
about in this boiler review I loved it okay there's also Luke and Leia acting,0.033261843
as a balance there's also Finn and Rose just really good equal gender representation men,0.037237644
speaking of representation po by the way he has a lot of great moments here,0.043839592
they really up to screen time and the character of benefits because of it however,0.011254242
there was some question as to whether or not he was a member of the,0.02414284
LGBT community I mean even Oscar Isaac seemed to be hinting at that but I,0.17941998
can tell you in this movie that they have completely shut that down and stepped,0.08208499
away from it and I think to some degree have even I think hinted of,0.0442254
going in the other direction that's gone also for those looking to Finn for representation,0.0410405
he continues to be a clownish character I liked john boyega's performance here he had,0.28124738
some nice moments but boy do I wish that Finn had more dignity and they,0.107688576
continue to really push this the space janitor angle you know for comedic effect tonight,0.030011091
it is helpful but still he's supposed to you know represent something for a lot,0.022033542
of people and it's unfortunate the movie though has some excellent villains I love them,0.05471601
from the seriously menacing Snoke huge Snoke fan to the comedic ly sniveling general Hux,0.09971036
again once I got general hooks I loved general hooks both Andy Serkis and Donald,0.10838769
Gleeson damo Gleeson I always mispronounce his name but they are both huge assets to,0.038459588
the movie but needs you del Toro and Gwendoline Christie though not so much finally,0.086727306
while the battle sequences again are very well thought-out and visually striking they desperately need,0.030801328
to hire a better fight choreographer because the lightsaber battles are unforgivably weak like wow,0.08041538
so in conclusion I feel this is a don't miss for Star Wars fans and,0.017611403
cinephiles because even though the sum is a bit satisfying the individual parts are just,0.19735533
too good to miss also even if you're not into Star Wars you know what,0.021176787
I say roll the dice because again there was so much here that was great,0.05901709
there's so much that was so funny I just said go in anyway and prepare,0.035946526
to be a bit bored you know what the more I think about it this,0.042044263
reminds me a lot of Lord of the Rings you know everyone can share their,0.035999738
moment when they dozed off and a Lord of the Rings movie or a hobbit,0.13836218
movie right and speaking of The Hobbit this franchise that franchise ultimately became too boring,0.05597587
to continue at least on the silver screen and that's something Kathleen Kennedy should keep,0.010492607
in mind if you don't have some reinvention and you get too steeped in mythology,0.092136584
even if you have a ton of like oh moments and this movie has them,0.029818187
you know it's ultimately just not enough to continue boy with all the average Joe,0.10172321
moments I'm like I really want that Disney streaming Star Wars series as well but,0.023147726
anyway we can't talk about too much because this is my non-spoiler review of the,0.019069485
last Jedi and I will definitely be seeing it again in theaters and I think,0.052461702
that's a pretty high vote of confidence so now you can go see it for,0.015636472
yourself and then join me for the spoiler review because if you're into this movie,0.050318483
there is so much to talk about and until then of course you can always,0.018542659
