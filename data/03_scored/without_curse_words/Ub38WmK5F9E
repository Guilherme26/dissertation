now this movie has a Netflix movie but I didn't watch it on Netflix in,0.05271277
the comfort of my house I went to an early screening two weeks ago I,0.08131803
woke up at 8 o'clock in the morning drove 2 hours and sat in an,0.09800972
art house theater that had the most uncomfortable chairs in all of human existence that's,0.18778174
a small price to pay for a new Scorsese movie so now let's talk about,0.10055108
the Irishman the Irishman starring Robert De Niro who plays a mob hitman recalling the,0.24148136
events of his past and his criminal activity revolving around the murder of Jimmy Hoffa,0.18238473
like I said I watched this movie for the first time in a theater and,0.083056554
I'm sort of jealous of everyone who got to watch this for the first time,0.15254073
on Netflix on their comfortable couch and they got to pause the movie whenever they,0.116621226
wanted to to get up to get more popcorn take a pee or refill their,0.31089434
drink which brings me to a profound thought I wonder if anyone actually made it,0.094097376
through this entire film without having to go to the restroom three and a half,0.08678836
hours movie now let's talk about the structure of this film and it's typical of,0.14939773
what Scorsese has done with previous films you have a main character who's a criminal,0.45782176
and he's recalling the events of his past with narration throughout the film and by,0.026331069
the end of the film it concludes in present day with the outcome of all,0.057230495
of those events oh yeah the structure this film is very similar to past coursezi,0.09677291
flicks but I like that method of storytelling this film's timeline spans from the 1950s,0.083055936
all the way to the 1990s and it all revolves around the disappearance of Jimmy,0.064911045
Hoffa who went missing in the 1970s he was murdered obviously and there's been a,0.24790455
lot of conspiracy theories floating around of what actually happened and this film directly relates,0.09741237
to all those events and centers around that and I'm a sucker for things like,0.4962187
that I love historical films and speaking of Jimmy Hoffa in this film he's played,0.06992655
by Al Pacino who's loud bombastic and he waits no longer than 10 minutes for,0.11525402
anyone and in my opinion this was perfect casting and I loved every scene with,0.09442135
Al Pacino because he just chews it up whoo-ha but the main character in this,0.15010741
film is played by Robert De Niro and he follow his journey from a delivery,0.014842162
driver to the right-hand man of Jimmy Hoffa and a mob boss named Russell who's,0.15283193
played by Joe Pesci and Joe Pesci always brings a smile to my face just,0.0818869
the way that he gives his lines in his performance I've been a fan of,0.07979989
Joe Pesci since home alone 1 as a kid but Joe Pesci for me is,0.09495168
really the standout throughout the film I just like the subtleties of this character named,0.054239493
Russell but I will say my favorite performance ever from Joe Pesci was in the,0.0761258
film casino he's just utterly insane in that film and I loved the little things,0.427349
that he says when he's just beating people's heads and yeah that sounds dark and,0.5987598
morbid but I stand by it what happened in a tough guy told my friend,0.18417153
stick it up let's talk about the Irishman himself Robert De Niro and what can,0.113693535
i really say about Robert De Niro's performance it hasn't already been said six thousand,0.06964064
other times and a much more pretentious way than I'll probably say but he's phenomenal,0.14704426
as always it's Robert De Niro and in this film he is playing the role,0.11568504
I've character a Frank who did all this crazy for the mob decades ago now,0.43513367
my biggest fear going into this film was I was hoping that the d aging,0.25044858
effects would look convincing and not be distracting because there's nothing worse than having great,0.17307779
actors great performances but it feels like there's this blurry mess of CG on top,0.17494513
of their faces because the actors in this film are in their 70s and they,0.061606847
need to look a lot younger because the film does span from the time period,0.05214171
of the 1950s to the 1990s and that's a long time period to really de-age,0.08370607
actors and make them look 40-plus years younger and does the movie really do a,0.05664398
good job of that it tries it really does try throughout this film they do,0.052442852
their best to camouflage the de-aging effect as much as they possibly can for example,0.097558334
when you have younger versions of Joe Pesci Al Pacino or Robert De Niro in,0.08516013
their 30s or 40s in this film when they're actually 70 years old acting these,0.08851634
characters they do their best to camouflage it with shadows or angles or maybe not,0.058358997
put the camera or a hyper focus up close to their face and keep them,0.39167044
in the distance and after 20 minutes into this movie you sort of just forget,0.115139864
about the D aging effect because the the actors performances honestly overshadow it they're such,0.076132305
good performances where you sort of forget oh this guy 70 years old he looks,0.17585585
like he's 60 years old with the D aging effect but really he's supposed to,0.076613545
be 30 years old so that's really my biggest negative from a technical standpoint with,0.09936747
the film the Irishman but with all that said I will say the most jarring,0.08145742
de-aging scene throughout this entire film was one of the first shots we receive Robert,0.06937289
De Niro keep in mind he's 70 years old attempting to play a 30 year,0.063540995
old driving this truck and the face does look slightly younger than 70 years old,0.11979409
maybe years old nowhere close to 30 but you still see old man Robert De,0.22636203
Niro's body and hands and I thought maybe they should have tweaked those aspects to,0.20096594
really make it more believable now the Irishman is a mob movie directed by Martin,0.18412207
Scorsese and it feels like a mix of a few previous other films like good,0.14324321
fellows or casino blended together in this film and you can tell that score says,0.085187174
he was wanting to include all his favorite things that he even puts in films,0.16151957
or he's directed over the course of his career into one film and just have,0.05342666
fun with it every little trope that he's done and he's perfected he put into,0.31089434
this movie and I like that it felt like a culmination of the best hits,0.17924215
of Martin Scorsese now let's talk about the runtime of this film it's three and,0.08651683
a half hours long and at times when you're watching this movie it feels like,0.07954835
you're binge watching a really good miniseries and even in the theater I was thinking,0.43071258
to myself okay that episode could've ended right there this one could start there this,0.10689953
one could in there this one could start there and don't get me wrong I,0.107408516
love a slow burn I love an immersive theater experience that takes its time it,0.104023606
develops the story and gives you everything you want and more and by the end,0.08265117
of this movie I was fulfilled but I will say is the three and a,0.06968926
half hour runtime completely necessary you know it's a Martin Scorsese movie Who am I,0.11393622
to say he should cut minutes off of his movie I should have a slap,0.48828328
my hand for such an accusation this is the part of the video where I,0.09630961
dive into negative as I had with the story of the film and really my,0.07676396
biggest criticism with the overall story of this film revolves around the subplot a Robert,0.07333262
De Niro's character and his daughter throughout the film and their relationship or lack thereof,0.085232496
because throughout the first half of this film you really feel like they're teasing something,0.15233776
to develop out of this relationship and have a payoff by the end of the,0.069802806
film and it never really happens you just you sort of understand that they they,0.1549568
weren't close but you you understood that by the first half of the movie and,0.103754714
it sort of just drags that same concept out into the end of the film,0.10151561
and it didn't really have the payoff that I think it could have it just,0.049485043
feels like it's sprinkled throughout the movie for the sake of being there now very,0.059350535
quickly before I give you my final flicking thoughts on this film there is one,0.106135964
technical aspect I did want to mention because I just found it fascinating the director,0.06688879
of photography of this film who did a phenomenal job this movie looks beautiful times,0.11401143
he did say throughout the film as it progresses into each modern day time period,0.066787764
from the 50s to the 90s he D saturated the film just a little bit,0.08718278
more as the film progressed and this was done to represent the depression and decisions,0.058666166
that these characters are making in their lives and how it's not for the betterment,0.085655406
of them as people and how as it progresses they become more depressed and the,0.26020908
audience should feel that same depression and I will say as I watched the film,0.08842747
in the theatre I did feel that way because it starts out vibrant in the,0.07374167
1950s and by the time you reach the end of this movie you just feel,0.15694149
miserable and and you understand that decisions throughout your life really affect the outcome and,0.5183736
it does make you think and that was sort of the message of this movie,0.077698916
but no worries don't get too depressed before I give you my final flicking thoughts,0.12233067
in this film I first want to mention the sponsor of this video and my,0.099223934

big thanks to you guys for watching now let's get back to the video and,0.09683959
now feature presentation now here are my final flicking thoughts on the Irishman this film,0.123714
is directed by Martin Scorsese and he still has the vitality that he had 40-plus,0.05316363
years ago this man is a master storyteller and he gets the best performances out,0.16451079
of any actors I've ever seen in a film and every movie that I watch,0.06684164
of his I am so captivated by it and the Irishman is no different I,0.13587575
was really fascinated by the real-life events with the unions and Jimmy Hoffa and the,0.06178586
things that went on behind the scenes in this film I just I loved every,0.06185048
second of it in all reality this film is sort of like the Avengers of,0.083606936
mob movies you have this perfect ensemble cast coming together to give this great performance,0.3244732
so with all that said I'm going to give the Irishman an a is it,0.09349571
my favorite Martin Scorsese film probably not is it his best mob movie in my,0.13859318
opinion probably not does it have as much rewatch ability as some of his other,0.11474348
films definitely not but this is a true piece of cinema and it's definitely worth,0.120343275
watching and I think this is a movie that will resonate for years to come,0.086252555
and it's by far the best Netflix movie ever made so now here's my question,0.058587946
for you guys and let me know down below what did you think about the,0.14991274
Irishman or do you guys paint houses what is your favorite mob movie of all,0.13257082
