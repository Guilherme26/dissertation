[Applause] yo what's up team I am back in the building let's go ahead and,0.124873534
dive right into the spoiler free review of Marvel's Avengers endgame let's talk story let's,0.117794804
talk script story I thought the story was very creative we have a 22 film,0.06804056
build up and this is a final act and they were able to make that,0.0561268
into a three hours story I thought that was tight however I felt it was,0.07813873
very messy because when you think about it you have a ten year plus build-up,0.14903356
right 22 films and you come with a messy but creative story yeah I'm in,0.15475912
the middle with the story let's talk about script keep it one hunting with you,0.1360516
guys I gotta keep it real I gotta keep it that that's me this was,0.114272416
one of the worst MCU superhero scripts I've ever seen this script had problems major,0.28580344
problems let's break it down this script had no character development the script was not,0.088150464
designed for newcomers the script required you to watch 22 films this script had one,0.10902805
of the most inconsistency when it came to power six inabilities this script also on,0.1023897
a lot of characters this was a bad script this script debunked the whole universe,0.14910856
this was a bad script I did not like this script this was a trash,0.6364068
script and what makes it worse this script tried to combine itself with the story,0.07424563
and the story was messy and the script is messy well we got a messy-ass,0.86765724
journey problems didn't like the script at all trash let's talk about the acting I,0.36818033
thought the acting was really good even though the script was bad the actors were,0.17214884
better than the script the actors still made you feel like you were watching superheroes,0.099652
it was like the actors took it into their own hands to make this movie,0.086240984
it's like literally the actors freestyle this film see some characters were done poorly but,0.10829097
the actors did the best they could do with what they had and with this,0.08292825
script they had nothing let me give you example so let's say they say Raj,0.10339769
we want you to play Optimus Prime in the next Transformers what I'm like all,0.26321357
right well you want me to do voice nah we want you to stay in,0.112595916
normal human form but we want you to be Optimus Prime right so I'm like,0.19529438
okay and action oh the matrix right right that's all I got right and they're,0.08538305
like you did great G but you suck as Optimus that's how it was you,0.9067504
did great Thor Chris F Chris hands what you did great but your Thor suck,0.9156528
you see I'm saying it's like that Mark Ruffalo you did a good job go,0.11506812
you did great if we do this how do we know it's gonna end any,0.28926682
differently than it did before the we gonna use you did a great job right,0.105247095
but you suck as The Incredible Hulk that's how it was the actors did their,0.88824683
part it's just with some characters they just didn't have nothing nothing it was like,0.06416786
we just gotta keep coming to our job we got to make the audience still,0.07862367
make I'm still looking as the superheroes and the actors did their part let's talk,0.09215407
about directing they're also brothers so many people say Andros we trust I am NOT,0.15743622
one of those I've seen a decline status and they're doing their directing abilities and,0.09182366
I have to say this they did an okay job but for two heads they,0.14957924
could've did better there are certain scenes when directing really matters those shots right and,0.11862947
I felt they didn't give me those shots they didn't give me the dramatic shots,0.31089434
yeah you can send a scene up but there's a certain way of directing it,0.084672935
for you truly to really fill certain things there were so many setups to fill,0.091227815
stuff but she didn't fill it well I didn't fill it and I wasn't going,0.10738664
in trying to be a hard critic or nothing I felt the emotions trying to,0.05817094
come but they're they're directing just didn't seal the deal dramatic shots didn't seal the,0.061117187
deal some action parts didn't seal the deal and they're they're there their vision their,0.06737667
shots were just kind of off to me it felt not organic it felt rushed,0.3291321
you know I mean it just didn't feel right the directing was cool but I've,0.0806939
seen better from them I've seen them give me something that was like well you,0.10616448
want to scream yeah not saying you don't get that in this movie but some,0.14957546
parts we're leading up to that and they fell flat this is what had me,0.065079086
out of my seat this is what was fun visuals this is a visual film,0.14854881
the world the acts the abilities the power sets the heroes the costume the visual,0.085860044
everything the CG the visual effects were dope I loved it I loved the visual,0.21491519
effects I thought the visual effects were amazing in this movie seeing the actors right,0.095740736
this is a crazy stuff this where the actors did the job they were behind,0.46046633
green-screen most of this film and for them to not even meet each other most,0.10252308
of the time doing their scenes they did a phenomenal job with the visuals it,0.09431688
made me feel like they were all there at the same time and I loved,0.07992217
it I loved it the visuals were dope in this movie I had no problems,0.22088575
with the missiles let's talk about entertainment was j-3 entertain I'll be honest you had,0.11707423
three acts in this film you had the first act second act third act right,0.122674435
three hours throughout that whole three-hour film I was entertained but this is the crazy,0.40308964
thing I was entertained in a different way right I'm entertaining a 10 year plus,0.07907074
build-up I'm entertained on what's gonna happen to my Avengers you seem saying I had,0.15330486
emotional attachment of entertainment to these characters because I'm be honest with you the first,0.08692433
and second act really wasn't action based entertainment it was more of a concern entertainment,0.074750364
I was concerned for my heroes and I think Marvel knew that coming in with,0.10180124
a three-hour film I was entertained by what could happen how are you going to,0.083638914
get out of this how you gonna fix this mess right so I'm entertained by,0.17928421
my heroes the third act had me visually emotionally action-packed entertainment whoa mind blown entertainment,0.13322859
but I really was entertained throughout this movie there was some parts that kind of,0.07485472
took me out of it but that's because the script was just that damn bad,0.7987158
let's talk about the music and sound first thing first the music we all get,0.036921978
the epicness but the music fell flat and I blame the Russell's for that because,0.13035671
their Direction didn't allow the music to enhance the scenes you see them saying you'll,0.09123672
play the music but that scene just doesn't carry in and fill in well with,0.10867991
what you're showing me let alone the script is back you know I mean so,0.123477824
the music was cool it was there I got it but when you take music,0.05811892
and you're directing a script is kind of off and nothing in is that balance,0.10655272
the music never gives you that climactic scene but the sound was amazing I love,0.13810442
the sound oh my gosh and Thor swing that hammer do you know I mean,0.25816268
a storm breaker man that sounded great I'm like oh no oh the Oh poop,0.5681271
the beans from I'm ant-man amazing the sound was tight I loved it I love,0.30125389
the sound sound was beautiful let's talk about some pros let's talk about some cons,0.15506798
pros I love seeing Captain America what a pro Iron Man Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow,0.24620171
Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as The Incredible Hulk and Chris Hemsworth as,0.06513049
Thor I love seeing them I love seeing those characters the pros of this movie,0.19343288
was me still feeling like they're my adventures that was a major pro for me,0.065956384
as a fan and a film goer because I was still able to feel that,0.050176956
even though the script didn't give me it I was still able to see them,0.08433636
as heroes that's a pro for me another pro and this is weird a lot,0.07770439
of people are gonna you know another Pro for me is how they handle Captain,0.102698356
Marvel yes I say two things about this character first things first they handle her,0.1538086
will they gave her enough where it wasn't like don't do this to me what,0.15938447
are you doing I came to see my Avengers just know this they gave her,0.1167381
her time and it wasn't a problem second thing brie Larson is a very pretty,0.24081424
woman and they were able to show me that she's a pretty woman right besides,0.30421954
us elbows right they was able to show me who she's a pretty woman recommendation,0.4033123
brie Larson dropped the Hillary Clinton suits be the woman I'm just saying you're pretty,0.34341493
like be the one like I've no problem with like just search scenes I was,0.06619221
like whoa okay okay machines only one there's a character in his movie yo and,0.16832931
I have some I had a thing for in his film yo um hear me,0.10518517
out this is a pro this character has been in multiple films right but we,0.060713552
never know we never noticed her like that right because her older more attractive sister,0.28987047
was always in the shine but after infinity war her sisters no longer there so,0.21909948
now it's all eyes on nebula uh Karen Gillian I think that's how I say,0.16584548
her name um she was sexy in his movie the way that woman walked oh,0.53490317
my gosh she can walk that runway like had me feeling some type of way,0.2396472
I had to tap ac3 like yo G God dead she's like I know it's,0.48787367
that walk she was sexy in this movie I don't know she had a freaking,0.6364068
hand she's she's having denims after up but she still was all woman under that,0.33874783
sheet man and she went fooling me I like nebula in this film she was,0.29594752
a pro for me my was like goddamn this is the probe I love it,0.6017928
I love it Oh beautiful um the other pros will spoil the movie so I'm,0.12635644
just gonna keep it at that cons oh this we got a lot of them,0.09543203
that script is a con and what makes it that much worse as a con,0.46464023
is the fact that every movie has flaws and plot holes and up and down,0.1071017
heartbeats right but when the average film goer can notice it that is a con,0.1173448
that is just a disaster it made me feel like they were like if the,0.22835821
story the audience wouldn't care anyway they're not even here for a story they're just,0.14083214
here to see the heroes and that was a con for me I didn't like,0.09246573
that one bit I didn't like the idea of the script being that much of,0.10956647
a Clyde hole device like that was a problem for me that was a major,0.27390692
kind knowing that the script was that much of a disaster another con I had,0.24170029
is certain characters man this is this is certain characters time to shine and goddammit,0.53490317
they still didn't shine it's like I was bamboozled I was bamboozled truly and I,0.20213304
feel some type of way towards that I said in our reaction I felt like,0.04520013
they were gonna bamboozle me and I was right I was bamboozled for the most,0.3693528
part for a lot of characters a lot of scenes a lot of situations and,0.04494494
I'm glad I expected him because it can really it would have really hurt me,0.17376123
right here tough if I let that if I didn't you know acknowledge it then,0.060809705
um the other cons spoilers let's go ahead and grade Marvel's Avengers and game I'm,0.14959383
gonna do it differently this time cuz I want to make sure you really hear,0.10012261

a script gets a D+ write story script is a d-plus the acting gets an,0.18871894
A I love the acting in this movie they're directing the Russo brothers you got,0.10927328
two individuals I felt coulda did way better than what they gave us the directing,0.15015084
gets a c-plus visuals though were phenomenal they were fun vibrant colors Supes powers dope,0.41134524
I give visuals in a my entertainment I was entertained throughout this movie but for,0.121205
different reasons emotional attachment to my characters concern 22 movies built to to film build,0.059564486
