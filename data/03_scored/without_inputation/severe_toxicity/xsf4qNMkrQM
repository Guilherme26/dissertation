you're obviously a movie fan if you're watching this video so you probably heard the,0.09564875
bad news about Hollywood nothing is sacred and originality is dead we movie fans live,0.08101205
in a world where Ghostbusters was reinvented and if somebody announced that they were remaking,0.030756762
the Godfather tomorrow we probably wouldn't be surprised we're also not surprised when these remakes,0.035396416
almost never live up to the original and for the remake to surpass the original,0.04345911
the odds are insurmountable and I say this not to worry you because as I,0.08996941
mentioned before it probably doesn't even surprise you but to let you know that this,0.036527894
version of a star is born' defies those odds let's make the odds of success,0.037276227
even more insurmountable shall we a star is born is not just a remake it's,0.03717778
a remake of a remake of a remake it's the fourth time this cinematic story,0.03932499
has been told and as much as he's a Hollywood a-lister Bradley Cooper hasn't really,0.027015768
directed a film before this is his directorial debut and on top of that he,0.028330836
thought he should also act co-write and take singing lessons as well I from one,0.058418423
of them really glad that he took all of this on because you can actually,0.038299944
tell this was a passion project that Cooper wanted to tell this story in every,0.024861239
nuance of the film you could tell that he was giving it his all and,0.017843552
yes that includes taking a few singing lessons now that seems like a small thing,0.06211751
but it actually lends itself to something that all films need and remakes generally lack,0.017874815
authenticity now I use that word because in the past on real school I've asked,0.028148577
this question before why is it important to you the filmmaker to retell a story,0.07685332
to remake a movie now granted I may never know why exactly it was important,0.049612723
for Bradley Cooper to retell this story but I never questioned the importance when watching,0.048493885
this film a lot of that actually goes back to him taking singing lessons and,0.056456797
I don't just mean the commitment it takes to take singing lessons it's the fact,0.024696939
that that importance that authenticity comes through in every facet of his performance but especially,0.036246523
in his singing it should also be said that while Cooper is not the most,0.02939114
refined singer he didn't really need to be because you know what neither guys like,0.02514128
Tom Waits Bob Dylan or Leonard Cohen they may not have the greatest voices in,0.05902906
the world fact is there's so much truth there's so much soul to their songs,0.039225213
that it's just encapsulating and so is Cooper in fact I would argue there's always,0.042887714
a vulnerability to somebody singing that there's always an authenticity because they're baring their soul,0.06879063
to you but as I mentioned before it's not just this singing because Cooper brings,0.086470544
that vulnerability that shared experience that openness in almost everything he does on screen but,0.016873714
really we've got to talk about the music if you're like me or millions of,0.018243326
others who have seen the trailer to this film chances are you've already got the,0.009563345
song stuck in your head and guess what when you see the movie they'll get,0.13264361
stuck all over again and that's a good thing kudos to the promotional team of,0.084717125
a star is born because it's one of the most memorable and powerful trailers I've,0.014024067
ever seen then again the footage comes from a mom memorable and powerful film and,0.021390976
music has been key in all previous versions of this film and you know what,0.03201795
Cooper really knew that because he knew exactly how to use music he and the,0.02053688
musical production team are the conductor's and the orchestra is the film itself the movie,0.008503708
hooks you right off the bat and of course it does that using music Bradley,0.14450715
Cooper's Jackson has this hypnotic swagger as he opens the movie blasting his version of,0.15195122
rock and country to a raucous crowd of thousands of concert goers but the music,0.22261567
can also be muted creating that sense of vulnerability and intimacy that I earlier spoke,0.028806442
of and it's that intimate musical connection that actually drives the story predominantly it's the,0.019583672
love story between Bradley Cooper's Jackson and Lady Gaga's Ally because it seems that the,0.027321087
only time that they're really themselves in terms of the characters is when they sing,0.015210754
to one another you see the songs of their love story and we're just there,0.014434485
to listen when I said that the music might get stuck inside your head just,0.3141468
like the trailer that I'd actually be doing it a disservice it doesn't just get,0.055353258
stuck inside your head it gets stuck inside your soul your heart it becomes a,0.35181835
part of you it really connects you to the film it's beautiful it's powerful it's,0.038417682
the for the winds I can't wait for this film to get a wider release,0.038683753
because I can't wait to get my ears on that full soundtrack like you saw,0.08329895
on the trailer Gaga and Cooper have tremendous chemistry but they also have tremendous balance,0.0121282935
while Cooper may not be the greatest singer and Gaga was the one coached him,0.062275156
up a bit when it came to his music Gaga is not necessarily the strongest,0.02832485
actor out there but Cooper gives her so much in their scenes together that she,0.083984755
really raises her game and guess what gives her performance that's on par with Bradley,0.042067543
Cooper director Cooper also really helps out their performance because he definitely uses the framing,0.026202248
of the camera and sound to make it seem like they're the only two in,0.029421072
the world it doesn't matter where they are on stage with thousands of screaming fans,0.055985846
in a loud dressing room full of hilarious drag queens in an abandoned parking lot,0.06873808
in the middle of the night or a brawl in a dive bar the fact,0.06403656
is you're only focused on them the point is you're always invested even to your,0.03038825
own detriment I actually found myself almost verbally yelling at the screen when some of,0.06204567
the characters made a bad decision I very rarely do that because I'm somewhat disconnected,0.017902752
from the film but that tells you how much I'm invested it was akin to,0.013723404
yelling at the screen and a horror movie telling a character not to go in,0.047558635
there because the killer is inside there was only one time where I was actually,0.09210133
taken out of the film in musicals the characters always jump into impromptu songs and,0.023494286
dance numbers and they instantly know the choreography and the musical arrangements and you know,0.011701911
what in this movie there was something very close to that now they tried to,0.02393863
address it but in my mind unsuccessfully but as I mentioned that's the only time,0.03380796
that my suspension of disbelief caused an issue because it's more of a drama with,0.028229063
music not a musical itself I also saw a very different performance that I'm used,0.01881472
to seeing from Sam Elliott who plays Jackson's older brother much much older brother now,0.02078965
you would think that's another moment where I couldn't necessarily suspend my disbelief but they,0.023397835
he really felt like brothers with all the fighting familiarity and frustration that comes with,0.037954714
a fraternity my biggest complaint was you get a tremendous dramatic performance from Chappelle noodles,0.059261877
and Jackson seem like friends you get a tremendous connection with Gaga and Andrew Dice,0.03210376
Clay they actually seemed like daughter and father you get this great brotherly relationship with,0.07033852
Cooper and Elliott and yet they're all gone way too quickly in this film if,0.031428598
the film had slightly better balance when it came to subplots and characters I felt,0.027502684
it could have been just that much more powerful but I also feel that this,0.017402535
is probably the most powerful version of this story so far granted the previous versions,0.015010534
of this film actually all had success the original one Oscar's the two previous one,0.0400986
Golden Globes for both their leads and you know what I don't see that changing,0.027323084
Gaga may not win Cooper's certainly won't win everything but this movie will win something,0.02068189
as a first film Cooper should be more than proud by his rookie effort he,0.01667948
created a very beautiful touching and intimate film he got everyone on the same page,0.1794865
and created a story that reflects on regret love addiction and shows us that music,0.047021832
can really connect us it is most certainly and earn it poll question who is,0.012793477
