I guess you learn movies I do too hi guys,0.1857266
and welcome back to another classic movie review today we're going to be reviewing it happened one night from 1934,0.0718674
one of the great romantic comedies of all time,0.11101887
well that's what a lot of people say anyway and it is directed by Frank Capra it stars a Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert I believe that's how you pronounce her name,0.09567016
and it's about a spoilt highness who runs away from her father after what she feels his mistreatment and on her bus journey to New York she meets clock gabled character who is a newspaper man who his job is a you know it's on the line at the moment,0.18674232
he looks like he's going to lose his job,0.28376502
and he really needs a story,0.04545022
that's worthy of him keeping his job and and this woman is incredibly famous and if he can get her story to his newspaper he might be able to get to keep his job and during this period their romance and saw characters sort of develop along the way and several situations and shenanigans in the shoe,0.22191362
so what did I think of it happened one night,0.06624725
well that's what I'm here to talk to you about today the main things that I really enjoyed in the film the first thing has to be Clark Gable because I believe that this is I haven't really seen Kyle gurgling much I haven't even seen gone with the wind not because I don't want to see gone with the wind is because I literally don't have time in my life to sit down watch a movie for four hours um it's it's too long,0.054359626
but it literally is too long,0.054293223
though I don't have time,0.085934915
but wait if I ever get the time I might might watch gone with the wind but that might not ever happen,0.050709028
and this is the first one were ever seen Clark they blew so and I think he was fantastic in this movie I think he was really charming,0.11891116
what are you entertaining very funny quick he had quite ego in this film and he was just really sharp,0.30596536
and I really enjoyed him in this film there's a lot of great scenes with him and called at Cole but that just they bounce off each other really well and she's very good in the film as well but I think cloud gave already steals the show here,0.17084262
I think he's very very good very very charming very very entertaining,0.1753128
but one of the main reasons that these two actors work so well together is because of the script I think this is a very very sharp script for the time is very very fresh,0.115624934
and it's very very funny,0.060433485
it's not you know,0.15204659
it's not an out and out comedy,0.15447478
this isn't a laugh riot or anything,0.08410273
this isn't like a Marx Brothers movie this is this is a more of a light comedy but it's still very entertaining and you definitely get a few chuckles out of the script and I think it's maximized by the performances by Goldberg and gable,0.084597155
I think that they really bring this script up on upper level,0.07207515
but I think it's a very good script my things very well written Capra does a great job directing this movie it's got his sort of nice sort of sweet sentimentality to it,0.13841347
you can definitely see Kat Pratt in Spielberg if use the way they direct their kind of have every man film sort of sweet sentimental messages and overall I really enjoy his direction in this film is still not my favorite Capra film that would be it's wonderful life which I should maybe be reviewing this Christmas as a special video so look out for that,0.08821115
but yeah I think capper is a very good director I want to watch more of his films,0.29653546
and this was I think one you know I've watched two of his films now on both of them in a very good,0.16864426
yeah I thought there was specific scenes especially that I really liked in this film that was a scene where Clark Gable talks to Cole boots character about how he undresses which is a very funny scene,0.15007621
there's a very famous scene about hitchhiking,0.07458766
how to hitchcock hitchhike which is very very entertaining,0.37714145
and there are many other scenes that are very good like comedy very entertaining very sweet and innocent,0.12207593
and this film is very innocent,0.07128045
I mean anyone could watch this this it's not going to offend anyone this is a really nice film anyone have any age young and old could watch this film they enjoy it,0.23214874
and I think that comes sort of onto my negatives with the film it isn't really specifically a negative is that it's a little dated this film and you'd expect a film from 1934 to be a little bit dated,0.16789146
that's not really my main negative it really is is that it's very predictable,0.09970396
I mean you can I'm just going to say it they are,0.099668115
they end up getting married at the end Clark Gable and Cole but they were lost you fall in love and they get married and you know that's you know standard its standard,0.088497914
what happens in romance films they you know we will get a happy ending and it's fine,0.17092974
but I'm one of these cynical people but kind of likes that sort of thing to be turned on its head every soft,0.44486743
and I feel like the best romantic films do that the Casablanca cause of this world the Vertigo's even though the vertigo isn't straight up a romance,0.1018967
it's as much your psychological thriller as it is a romance but I feel like the best romantic films try to do something different,0.15114948
with the ending because it's so easy to just do a happily ever after and that's pretty much,0.076113895
what this film does but you know it is it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the rest of the film it would have just been nice to see something different,0.069398314
so overall,0.06683014
I really enjoyed it happened one might thought it was really sweet and funny I thought the script was fantastic and I thought the performances by product cobalt and especially Clark Gable in this film we're very very good,0.046401843
there's only a few negatives being that it's quite predictable ending,0.10013816
and there is a little bit dated,0.3559818
but that's what you would expect from a form of this age when overall I really enjoyed it's wonderful it's a wonderful life,0.14856285
no it happened one night I really enjoyed it,0.11020648
and I'm going to give it 8 point 5 out of 10 and yeah it would have been a bit higher,0.2536124
if maybe the ending had been slightly less conventional,0.24247724
but I still really enjoyed it,0.05831772
and I definitely you know tell you guys,0.05568205
if you haven't seen it to check it out it probably won't be a blu-ray purchase or anything,0.09357494
