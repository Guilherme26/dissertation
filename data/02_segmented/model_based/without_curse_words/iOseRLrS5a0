"Everybody, and welcome back to another movie night - movie review"
"My name is Dalton Burdette, And today we're gonna be talking about nineteen fifty twos, Singing in the rain"
"This film stars Gene Kelly, Donald O'connor and the great Debbie Reynolds, and this film was also directed by Gene Kelly, one of the main stars and Stanley Donen"
"This is a movie musical, one of the classic movie musicals, but also the plot of this movie also just kind of wraps its way into movie history, which is the period of time where movies transition from being silent films to movies with sound or talkies as they were called"
"So it takes place in the late 1920s, and it's sort of really about like this Hollywood stardom Opening scene of this movie is brilliant"
"One of the great things about this movie is its excellent use of comedy and comedic timing, and the way that it uses its exposition"
"And I really liked how there's a scene in this movie where these two characters you know, Gene Kelly's main character and one of the annoying co-leads who? That actress was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress in this movie Because she's so funny in it"
Her name was a Jean Hagen in real life
"Anyway, they're being interviewed and the interview is asking him like, I'll tell us about your story in your humble beginnings, And while he says things about how he went to this prestigious you know school and how he started off by doing dance classes here in acting classes here, it's actually narration / flashbacks of what really happened in his life and it's him starting from"
"It's like a rags to riches story, but you've seen conflicting narration with what's actually happening to kind of show"
"It not only sets the tone for what the feel of the movie is, which is comedic, it shows his actual backstory, and it gives insight as to how the you know Hollywood make a machine influences how you have to be in your public persona"
"So it does just all of those things in one scene, and it was such an awesome and interesting way to go about doing that and also speaking more towards the cast like Gene Kelly, Donner Will Collar are great, but like Debbie Reynolds, Just what a national treasure"
Debbie Reynolds is like
"You're nothing but a shadow on film, a shadow"
you're not flesh
The musical numbers in this film are excellent
"I think that it's not only just the quick choreography of the dance and lyrics of the songs, but also just the cinematography and direction of said musical scenes are really well done, Almost better than the actual scene themselves was just how the musical scene was filmed, and while the film does have a lot of really well working comedy, I think another great thing about this film is it's very deep characters, and how each each character sort of serves its own purpose to the story, but also is just a fundamentally different character"
"You know, Gene Kelly's character is just, you know the main lead who is really tired of being taken over by the Hollywood system"
"You have to be Reynolds, who's an up-and-comer who wants to get into the Hollywood system, And you have Donna O'connor's character, who is also a hugely funny character whose role is to just be the best friend of Gene Kelly, because they've been best friends since they were growing up, and just also, you know, always play the piano"
Be there and just kind of be that guy
That is the
You know how about we do this
You know that guy like that
There's a role in every friend group for that guy and this is what he does and I know I keep you know being repetitive saying how well the comedy works in this movie
But this film is genuinely really funny and that's not something that gets talked about very often when singing in the rain gets brought up
Since it's a musical
Beavers talked about the music
"This film is hysterical, but you have to in the bush"
try it again
She'll get it textured look cleaner
Don't worry
We're all a little nervous the first day
everything's gonna be okay
"Oh, by the way, Rosco, you know the scene coming up where I say imperious Princess of the Night, I don't like those lines"
"There is it Alright if I just say what I always do, I love you"
I love you
I love you
"Sure anyway, it's comfortable, but into the bush"
Okay again? Why? but Dena? we're missing every other word
You've got to talk into the mic
"All right, All right, and also, just since I'm a sucker for you know, movies being about movies, you know, seeing the silent to talkie transition happen, and how Hollywood kind of freaks out and they take it more of a comedic route with it"
"But if that was just really fun to see portrayed in a sort of fantastical musical style movie, And you know the few scenes where you get all three of them together, especially when they're performing musical numbers"
It's just it's pure cinematic magic
It's wonderful
"As far for negatives about the film, this film was only like an hour and 43 minutes long"
"but it does feel its length at certain points, or just means that there's an issue with the pacing, and while it's not a huge problem, it is noticeable, and this movie does kind of do things for the sake of doing them, and not necessarily for the benefit of this story"
"And look, I understand the cinema of attractions"
"I totally get it, but like there's a sequence where they have to rewrite one of their movies Because it's just it played horrible"
"It was garbage and they're trying to figure out how to fix this movie and Gene Kelly is like, Oh, How about I pitched this musical number And then it does the musical number that he's pitching to the producer And it's like it's the biggest musical number in the movie"
It's long
"It's extravagant and it looks beautiful and it was extremely well done Like that's not the the point, but, but like we were in such an integral part of the movie And then it just like puts the plot aside and does this musical scene that is extremely long, and then it just cuts back to the producer and the producer is like Ah, Yes, great idea"
And it's just like Okay That that seemed just felt very misplaced to me
"so I think just pacing and the you know, very, very small instances of style over actual substance of what's going on can really hurt the movie, but not in a big way, but it is noticeable, and you know one more positive before I end it"
"as I'll say, this movie is very thematic Alia rich, you know, the actual singing in the rain sequence it to a point where the lead character is kind of having a rollercoaster of ups and downs throughout his career, And you know that scene really comes about to tell just the you know underlying story of when you're dealt about hand when you have a bunch of horrible things happening around you when it's raining outside, Just sing"
"Just make the best of what you have, and eventually you'll find happiness out of that, and this movie does do a great job of reiterating that story in an underlying manner where it's not too in-your-face and I like subliminal stories like that, So overall I love singing in the rain"
I think it's a wonderful musical movie
I think the numbers are great
I think the characters are great
The actors are great
"However, I do think it's pacing could be better, and there are some scenes that are just there to be there and not necessarily serve to the story or the characters"
"But this is still a fantastic movie and I'm going to give Singing in the rain in a thank you guys so much for watching, and we hope to see you soon"
