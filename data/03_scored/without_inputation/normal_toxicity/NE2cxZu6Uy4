being referred to as the quote-unquote female super bad and it's really a shame and,0.44567382
a disservice to both films here's the thing the two films are similar yes and,0.14853217
one is about two highschool dork suit decide that before they graduate they are going,0.5341069
to indulge in some wild partying and lose their virginity the two dorks here are,0.7451029

wild partying and maybe hook up with some classmates the two dorks here are being,0.36950728
played by a Kaitlyn Dever and beanie Feldstein who coincidentally is Jonah Hill's real-life sister,0.19674097
so yeah similar but like I said both films and actual execution style and real,0.2417532
plot couldn't be more different super bad is really a wild ride about two best,0.16359186
friends dealing with the fact of growing apart from one another Seth feeling that he's,0.06822862
always held his friend Evan back with his ineptitude and Evan secretly wanting to distance,0.5876557

the relationship to one another and the fact that these two bros won't be with,0.06293431
each other after high school but this video isn't about super bed it's about book,0.31222993
smart and book smarts actual premise isn't really the bare-bones synopsis you'll see either it's,0.19386545
about two best friends who realize that while they spent highschool only worrying about their,0.101023994
grades and extracurricular activities to get as far ahead in life as possible throwing parties,0.14933164

Amy are gonna get an entire four years of debauchery and one night at one,0.40323356
party listen it is very important that you keep the safety the first thing I,0.14762548
need to talk about in regards to book smart and how much this movie works,0.14002866
is in its dialogue the film's biggest success in my personal opinion the credit there,0.032474697
certainly goes to the film's writers comprised of Emily Halpern Sara Hoskins Susannah Fogle and,0.044234812
Katie Silverman a lot of media revolving teens has this thing where the characters in,0.0752391
question always seem kind of fake the main culprit behind this is what I call,0.24608058
teen speak you have 40 year old men writing teen dialogue and how they think,0.25035694
teenagers talk is definitely not Riverdale is not the problem it's gonna take you to,0.10720091
decide between music or baseball book-smart is so great because these girls actually sound like,0.25531054
teens their conversations don't feel forced for the sake of making a movie and hitting,0.18694948
plot points while trying to sound hip I read that this movie went under many,0.100850105
on the fly rewrites director Olivia Wilde yes that Olivia Wilde told her cast that,0.18979982
if a piece of dialogue didn't seem authentic that they should improvise it in a,0.09563359
way that did and I gotta say they succeeded on all fronts Molly and Amy,0.09093239
feel so real because they are they aren't contrived teens written by how chad chattington,0.17192945
thinks his daughter acts they're carefully created four dimensional girls made by many funny women,0.33332253
the two funniest Molly and Amy these two girls really seem like best friends the,0.23239784
chemistry between them is fantastic a lot of credit here belongs to different Feldstein as,0.11390316
they really helped create these two with the improv dialogue as mentioned previously wild ask,0.0959983
these two to live together in order to develop a wrapper between them and they,0.14931597
did for ten weeks they live together and this experience definitely shines through in the,0.018208614
film no but we lived together during the movie and it was the greatest time,0.05846288
filled with snacks and pancakes and sleeping until 2:00 p.m. because we would get home,0.12095835
at 6:00 a.m. because we would start our days at 6:00 p.m. because we had,0.08182754
night shoots well one could argue that Devers amy is the classic quote unquote straight,0.40319443
man to felt stains goofball it's really not the case both do amazing work in,0.5154597
making both Amy and Molly have their moments and not file under any specific trope,0.09103789
because we were so prepared when we got there we were able to have so,0.037746724
much fun because we knew exactly who our characters from you know exactly the story,0.044515215
we were telling we knew the lines we knew the day and we could just,0.029459972
be free and actually really enjoy it yeah and it was also great to get,0.06127131
to do that with you I feel like sometimes your passion doesn't really match with,0.2425443
the passion of the other actor on the film that you're doing but beany and,0.1496342
I both came at it with with so much passion and drive and love for,0.080842674
these two girls and we both had a deep understanding knowing that we had to,0.11057296
get this dialogue exactly right because this movie relies on it and they're always matched,0.08849792
always together yeah another reason book-smart is so great as in this one a teeing,0.23074752
of the typical teen stereotype the popular kids aren't just dumb jocks and pretty girls,0.69542736
they're real people too last a present for my favorite team Jared you're not my,0.15117759
student I've heard great things and hey everybody else got their graduation guess right come,0.0722716
on Jer bear coming at you from all angles right nobody asked for that big,0.19677165
me little over me well baby jar at the bottom the supporting cast is so,0.2656898
well written too compared to most any other high school comedy I mean book smarts,0.28098762
plot is kick lined because Molly realizes that her classmates aren't the one-dimensional idiots that,0.8606264
she thought there were many moments and interactions throughout the 105 minute runtime where we,0.07090603
see that these other students aren't just cheap characters even the typical theater kids are,0.15180236
written and played so genuinely and not for a cheap gag or punchline that it,0.22016989
really makes you feel for these characters Shakespeare in the Park gang what we will,0.119663395
be performing the Bart's comedies as modern tragedies outside Whole Foods across town was actually,0.06636612
funny it's what we did in my summer program last year in Barcelona when I,0.07744354
lived in because of this book smart really gets you and it immerses you in,0.1955873
this high school experience honestly with it being one of the best depictions in media,0.068425335
not everything though can be without fault and book-smart does become a little dazed ex,0.24130657
machina towards the end but so do most comedies so I can't really fault it,0.10046884
too much for that but certain situations are either gotten out of her avoided seemingly,0.12734504
with no problem at all I don't want to go into specifics due to supply,0.06397555
their reasons but I'm sure those who have seen this film know what moments I'm,0.0757463
referring to and don't get me wrong this film isn't cheapened at all by these,0.18041342
moments it doesn't have validate anything it just happens to be slightly upsetting when this,0.09745769
film has been doing most everything else perfectly the biggest triumph of book-smart is in,0.15524289
its representation this is a movie written by four women directed by a woman starring,0.33258048
women all of which are at the top of their game it's probably why this,0.24179545
movie feels so fresh these are perspectives which we rarely see out of Hollywood and,0.060131907
this movie proves and we need more of them book smart is a success not,0.1560267
just because of the of its creators but it should be mentioned because if film-like,0.045180112
book-smart is rarely made it's about a strong female friendship I think that that is,0.18457353
what this movie is about it it's more I think it's a movie that will,0.08593857
make you laugh she's got a really cute smile not as sharp as your chin,0.44987398
it's a movie that'll make you cry it's it's not only a comedy and it's,0.23419347
not only a film just made for women I think that seeing two female leads,0.331333
on the poster I think that people have this like misconception of oh this is,0.111622326
a movie only for women but literally it's a movie for everybody I've never seen,0.31113225
one of these characters at the center of the film let alone two of them,0.05999355
and the fact that they're I mean they couldn't be less competitive with each other,0.10287219
they're actually like aggressively obsessed Sophie's not there no no no not excited come on,0.12769225
okay allow me this beautiful he's really really special this is a raunchy comedy about,0.28443885
two teenage girls one of which who happens to be a lesbian and the film,0.061831776
never turns her or them in escape goats for cheap sex gags or one-liners it's,0.48241627
just a funny ass movie I put out a message and asked my female friends,0.9004478
to give their thoughts on this movie as they would be way more accurate in,0.08974918
describing how important it is to them and our current climate and here are some,0.03255047
of their thoughts overall book smart is worth it a hilarious film with plenty of,0.27343768
portability which you should definitely add to your library a huge success for first-time director,0.06772612
Olivia Wilde a great vehicle to show the many talents of Kaitlyn Dever beanie Feldstein,0.13590588
in the rest of the cast one of if not the way to look at,0.066875264
how to write and create teenagers believably and finally one of the best comedy films,0.09555951
of the decade book smart is well worth the price of a ticket a DVD,0.1702619
and your time see it now as its box office hasn't really indicated what a,0.07126151
truly great film it is thank you for watching this video and beginning this journey,0.07009343
