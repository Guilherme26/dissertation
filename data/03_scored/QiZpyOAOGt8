you saved the entire world i'm such a cry baby hey guys so today's movie,0.40309647
commentary hmm i get so many comments about arrival i have seen a rival and,0.047651235
i get so sick of telling people in the comments i've seen it i've seen,0.22677624
it i've seen it i alternate between films where they're like funny jokes where they're,0.10895544
cheesy where like i can just sing along or laugh to then like jumping back,0.090853654
to something which is more critically acclaimed it should be interesting to revisit this i,0.05913496
remember that there's aliens and amy adams and jeremy renner and i think forrest whitaker,0.15328677
is in this too it's about language and trying to communicate with them but i,0.068421006
was discussing with someone about how i've seen it but i don't really remember anything,0.088130884
from it i don't remember everything i don't think so it's kind of a re-watch,0.08490325
but also i feel like i might be surprised by certain things possibly maybe we'll,0.038253702
see everyone's saying it in the comments all the time i just kind of got,0.052608263
sick of it so i thought why not just like re-watch it together because then,0.2704221
i can just say it's on my channel i can just like copy paste it,0.06224028
into the comments i've seen it it's on my channel it's on my channel stop,0.18169284
hassling me about it i feel like i should do more denis films like i've,0.18172516
i think i've seen all of his films except for incendi's yeah i guess let's,0.14684366
jump into this so i mentioned this on my twitter the other day i find,0.2387995
it so so funny i find it like actually hilarious when i read these comments,0.091717064
where people tell me stop talking you talk too much like just watch the movie,0.15193246
it's literally in the title it says movie commentary like this film goes for nearly,0.10168939
two hours this video will go for like 20 25 minutes i'm not talking throughout,0.15045097
the entire film you do realize that right majority of the time that i'm sitting,0.07943333
here i'm actually not speaking i'm literally watching the movie these are just like highlights,0.17109041
this is the portions of the movie that i'm talking at least majority of them,0.09171617
i don't know why i actually have to put that out there like if you,0.17674902
want to watch the movie with no one talking i don't know why you're watching,0.16846159
a movie commentary video i feel like putting the definition of commentary on the screen,0.084100366
right now [Applause] i used to think this was the beginning of your story on,0.049517665
the nature of daylight by matt uh max richard it's already playing it's already playing,0.0694549
this opening scene i don't i i'm gonna cry my tissue is sitting over there,0.13572812
in case i start crying imagine losing your child like your child when they're a,0.6364068
teenager or a baby or just it happens to so many people but it's just,0.20270881
that's so unfair now i'm not so sure i believe in beginnings and endings there,0.07189332
are days that define your story beyond your life like the day they arrived ends,0.1363047
in beginnings why am i getting dark vibes guys do we believe in an end,0.15252967
in the beginning where is everyone okay well let's get started literally for uni i,0.039828606
turn up for like the first lecture the next like three months i don't even,0.14878885
go to the lectures and if they're recorded which majority of them are i don't,0.09800069
usually listen to them that was me in uni i don't i'm not i don't,0.09815774
study anymore but that was me in uni that was pretty much me if they're,0.10078026
not compulsory then i wouldn't go to them do people not have their phones on,0.15996297
silent i always have my phone on silent who wants beeps and tones and stuff,0.09319686
coming off all the time it's so frustrating mom please don't bother with that channel,0.36579382
how many times do i have to tell you those people are idiots choose your,0.88560754
media sources wisely and correctly because there are so many people out there and like,0.07839109
news telecasts and journalists that just speak absolutely nlgger like total nlgger i love that,0.359845
she's sleeping hugging a pillow that is so subtle like a way of showing me,0.23980182
maybe that she's lonely or missing like comfort and companionship you know a lot of,0.14588
people do that with pillows like they want to be able to hold something or,0.098746575
hug someone there's like literally things that you can buy like like human size that,0.16960107
you can cuddle when you're sleeping the atf has put a temporary ban on new,0.12698525
gun licenses forcing many independent suppliers of hunting equipment and firearms to close their doors,0.15155178
to the public piss off firearms should not be your priority right now i can,0.47080874
tell you that it's impossible to translate from an audio file i would need to,0.07284551
be there to interact with them i feel like this was a whole new language,0.06969683
that they created right for this film that they like did this from scratch like,0.08578165
made an actual full language i could be making this up but i feel like,0.05983935
that's a thing oh jeremy renner he's the map oh i just kicked the camera,0.43426296
my bad i like jeremy right now when he's put in good roles he's really,0.19491114
good like he's actually a really good actor he made me cry in endgame he,0.31089434
made me cry given good movies i am down for that how about we just,0.10494306
talk to them before we start throwing math problems at them this is why you're,0.31089434
both here opposites working together i like that the importance is trying to find common,0.056856543
ground common ground between opposites you're not going to get anywhere unless you have the,0.15002885
opposite ends of the spectrum to work together that's just general knowledge people where do,0.11351491
you expect us to get anywhere if people don't nlgger work together we're going to,0.27370375
get nlgger all done zero productivity dude like come on come on that aerial shot,0.55760425
that swooping aerial shot is just denise that looks like miniatures that literally they look,0.20343779
like miniatures does that look like not look like a miniature set to you guys,0.22349627
because it does to me i love that like 360 swooping around i love that,0.04991292
that's amazing put these on you're going to wear them at all times that um,0.10143233
military guy that was there before he's the decade from ready or not he's the,0.11059691
husband from ready or not oh my god that movie if you haven't checked out,0.10823545
my commentary for that that was eventful that was an eventful commentary and very entertaining,0.0657068
the use of the orange is so just like kind of finding it hard today,0.07930578
to articulate my words i don't know why but the orange just makes them stand,0.09827106
out so much in regards to how cool toned the rest of the scenery is,0.0731121
the entire um color scheme is so dull so i love that they're in orange,0.31089434
suits i love that you know what that reminds me of it reminds me of,0.08678932
like a contact lens not that i have contact lenses but it looks like a,0.07538016
disc kind of like an eye like a not a puke like a pupil i,0.53490317
don't know i don't know is that giving you um 2001 as face odyssey sort,0.3640816
of vibes that shot i haven't seen that movie i know i know i know,0.18168554
what is wrong with me guys huh i feel like i'm gonna like look at,0.14028777
this movie and be like i like that shot that shot is gorgeous do you,0.69542736
like that shot because i like that shot that looks beautiful who nlgger loves this,0.6046657
sound design in this school huh who's on the same page as me let's turn,0.16051573
this volume up guys obviously they need to use animals to be able to tell,0.24017917
if they're safe they're not going to use humans obviously still poor birdie what if,0.16308896
the birdie died i don't want the birdie to die the tension of this movie,0.37828046
my ears are in heaven right now after this i am so watching behind the,0.06289481
scenes videos guys i need to know how this nlgger was bloody made what they,0.6809007
used to make the sound of them how they made the language the special effects,0.06950074
the design my brain needs to know how this happened how this worked their website,0.10278683
claims the arrival of the aliens set in motion a prophecy the 12 sets of,0.08026189
12 should be followed this kind of thing just brings on the bloody maniac people,0.7958814
that are just believe in absolute total nlgger the minority are so much more vocal,0.4426608
than the silent majority i'd be shaking i wouldn't be able to deal i would,0.0816596
not be able to deal if i was her no way would i last i,0.15092914
would majorly fail as my position as her i'd be like nope not gonna happen,0.22616969
amazing amazing it's like squid ink but like smoky like squid that is so cool,0.09071844
that's incredible yes it is incredible wow oh special effects amy adams is amazing she's,0.2398473
such a great actress she's in so many roles like so many roles and i,0.080163024
just adore her and her eyes are so blue she has the most blue eyes,0.14494655
contamination they need to see me back doctor she's walking towards the screen i don't,0.12902425
i don't think you're really going to be able to convince her otherwise just let,0.16422537
her do her thing if she dies that's on herself that's her own that's her,0.51089644
own fault oh my god that sh oh wow oh oh god the goddamn oh,0.8355208
the texture on there like skin so detailed ew that's actually kind of gross it's,0.39909884
actually kind of gross ew louise i am louise screw it just take it off,0.60449934
imagine if they just died just like bam dead dead on the spot they have,0.7021353
names what are we going to call them bob and jeff well that was totally,0.1545145
off book oh but he's not happy ready or not guy is not happy he,0.183881
doesn't seem very pleased looks like a giraffe what is that horse why did i,0.2579348
say giraffe looks like a giraffe here are some of the many things we don't,0.24043451
know about heptapods greek hepta seven pod foot seven feet heptapod i think that exposition,0.14336097
exposition each scene was very much needed subtle and it wasn't just like info dump,0.31089434
dump which was good it was like providing us with knowledge that we need just,0.16192567
to sort of recap you know how exposition scenes can be like that where they're,0.09491772
just like damn here is all your information that you need damn the same government,0.8060606
who ruined our healthcare and bankrupted our military look at these people most of them,0.43931848
don't even have guns who needs nlgger roof guns are not the nlgger solution oh,0.25955823
she's hugging her daughter like she was hugging her pillow oh how sad i don't,0.31089434
think that that makes me unfit to do this job the one thing that's really,0.15048078
stood out to me so far is the lighting like i feel like we haven't,0.10061451
really gotten many harsh contrasts in the lighting it's very soft and luminous really like,0.0637037
that i just i love the way that lighting is used in this movie our,0.08759624
language like a culture is messy and sometimes one can be both and it's quite,0.1535796
possible that they're asking us to offer them something not the other way around you,0.12224667
go to google translate and write in a word for like a certain language for,0.11691592
it to be translated into another language it can be something completely different this is,0.04073402
absolutely frustrating nlgger off nlgger off i already have like a passionate hate for him,0.71445274
already all people want is to nlgger kill other people and create hate and war,0.67357904
in the world i know you have to be safe and protect your borders and,0.099
protect your country but that's not going to get us anywhere no don't disconnect from,0.11146892
australia no no we need to be talking to each other we want to talk,0.15319237
exactly communication i can't believe they explode they try and nlgger send off a nlgger,0.6301989
bomb a bomb you pieces of nlgger you're all piece of this nlgger nlgger you,0.8780105
i can't belie actually no that's not far-fetched that's honestly not ridiculous like that's not,0.54717624
something that wouldn't happen like obviously that's gonna happen we've been attempting to hail captain,0.15235814
marks the escort units are not responding sir why not said security the escort units,0.060728546
aren't responding it's because they're nlgger murderers they're murderers i get angry but i just,0.62131166
i don't want to deal with hateful people i don't knock knock who's there so,0.34170765
what they're gonna kill other humans so they can kill the two heptapods so they,0.67397815
can kill albert and costello they're going to kill other humans other military people who,0.74494565
are probably their friends people they work with that has no logic that has no,0.12804376
no logic i don't know which one it was but they protected them he protected,0.103045516
them and saved them oh my god they are not harmful to humankind they're not,0.15498859
said the aliens have 24 hours to leave chinese territory or face destruction and he,0.46344376
urged all other world leaders to unite with china and take a similar stance no,0.14372621
no no it's a non-zero sum game non-zero sum game what the nlgger have i,0.40758437
forgotten about this movie like they're giving have given her powers this is so frustrating,0.2407763
me oh can she see oh she can see future events she can see oh,0.07822643
oh my god it's coming back to me it's coming back to me now okay,0.10155901
okay my i i remember i kind of remember the ending i kind of remember,0.2397891
the ending now yes yes yes yes hop in get in there i don't know,0.078717396
how i feel about the hair how do you guys feel about the hair do,0.08613288
you think it looks good i think it looks good but a little something doesn't,0.12691799
feel right oh it's so much bigger than they thought has it got a head,0.18422541
oh my god oh that shot oh my god that's so cool how can you,0.29191962
know the future because we're aliens that's how we do the future because we're aliens,0.14897949
from out of space mommy and daddy talk to animals oh my god yes the,0.32030436
bird oh okay okay now it's all clicking imagine being able to see the future,0.06478096
i think all of it's coming back to me so the technology that they gave,0.07867118
her technology or weapon in their language because obviously they're still struggling to communicate the,0.16169691
weapon is being able to open time and so all these flashbacks are actually her,0.15321267
seeing the future of her daughter her daughter's future and mommy and daddy mummy daddy,0.5154597
see the future jeremy rena is her husband and they have the child but then,0.09332872
they get a force okay okay yeah yep i told him something that he wasn't,0.24141578
ready to hear what that you're dead that you're going to die that you're oh,0.7004802
that's so sad honey your daddy didn't leave you you're going to see him this,0.25632545
weekend he doesn't look at me the same way anymore of course he doesn't she,0.15187582
told him that she dies i just realized why my husband loved me are you,0.5902252
remarried not past tense future tense future tense i will be married well your name,0.16858576
is very special because it is palindrome it reads the same forward and backward because,0.093319684
at the beginning she said when it comes to time we don't know if when,0.089394875
there is the ending when there is the beginning because she's open with time now,0.091613956
like time is open so so you can see what's to come the time it,0.07898283
it isn't the same for them it's non-linear i love how she's saying like the,0.100663975
language is non-linear because when you think linear you think like straight you know start,0.21758796
and end but they're the way that it's visually representated is like a circle it's,0.1863626
round like i just find that so interesting how visually the language reflects the concept,0.076281965
and idea of how the language actually works the design of it the design just,0.049768377
like that blows my mind it was an honor to work with good luck good,0.28286734
luck having a child that eventually will pass away and my husband will leave me,0.1532398
because i tell him that our daughter dies from a rare disease and had her,0.6046173
anyway because i wanted to have her but also that's so difficult that's so difficult,0.11573369
of a choice you're the reason for this unification all because you reached out to,0.11030424
me on my private number how do people come up with these things like writers,0.10141426
filmmakers just uh astound me you're quite sure who i you are committing an act,0.13081561
of treason yeah to save the entire world you save the entire world imagine if,0.17703272
like stuff that happens in sci-fi films is real could you imagine like close encounters,0.17167185
like what's the one with jodie foster i s contact like insane imagine if we,0.14930853
had all of these abilities and all these things we're capable of these things and,0.08621154
we're flashing back to the beginning of the movie the beginning is the end the,0.060017977
end is the beginning i love that concept so nlgger much it just messes with,0.15729909
your brain i love them together they are i love their chemistry they're amazing daddy,0.3651143
oh i'm tearing up oh i wasn't meeting them is meeting you i'm such a,0.14781642
crybaby music makes me so emotional i cry so much in movies this nlgger movie,0.61198044
wow incredible why did i get it so get me so emotional that ending on,0.13248673
the nature of daylight is it has its own section in the credits yes that,0.0638654
song just has its own tiny little section in those credits it just nlgger helped,0.24037674
i re-watched my favorite films over and over again so many times but i never,0.0901521
re-watch this what is wrong with me thinking back on it now they foreshadowed a,0.114772744
lot of different things like the part where she said go ask your father because,0.0777734
he's the scientist like that's hinting at how ian is her father because he's the,0.11245036
mathematician it's kind of therapeutic sitting down and talking to you guys going through like,0.14651774
all the recurring events in this movie letting it come back to me sink in,0.16648509
understanding it i want to know was this nominated for stuff was this nominated for,0.052656807
best picture winner of sound editing yes so happy with that but it was nominated,0.050008222
for best picture achievement and directing so director adapted screenplay was nominated for cinematography film,0.06271147
editing sound mixing production design oh my god it was like nominated for everything denis,0.07990094
you are a genius you are a genius sean levy sean levy why is its,0.16036807
name sound familiar oh my god he's a producer for stranger things he's canadian too,0.09539355
oh so he was a producer how many produce 14 producers holy nlgger i'm so,0.23986381
happy i rewatched it on my channel with you guys because i wasn't even planning,0.32461405
on it on doing this but i definitely got a new perspective and experience on,0.07135782
this film okay well let me know your thoughts on arrival if it's your favorite,0.14606293
denis film what you enjoyed about it if you didn't like it that's your opinion,0.14396177
everyone's allowed to love or hate whatever movies they like i knew at some point,0.28837729
i was gonna cry because i i usually majority of the time cry at some,0.13784595
point in a movie i hope you guys enjoyed and i'll talk to you guys,0.24022433
