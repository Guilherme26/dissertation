hi guys,0.064576566
I'm Maria and welcome back to Santa club,0.09072995
today I'm going to be reviewing the new Pixar movie for you which is inside out,0.19084035
I have been waiting for this movie to come out for a very long time,0.116918996
we have talked about it multiple times in our movie podcast now conspiring and we've been very excited about it,0.10041554
and it's finally here,0.089066505
and I got to see it last night,0.1134636
I don't want to give away too much of the plot because i feel like if you say too much it gives away the magic and i feel also like the creators have done a really good job and not saying too much about what happens that really keeps the interest in mystery alive and I feel like that's how you should go into this movie not know you so much about it except that it's about the voices inside your head how they work,0.10056001
and you know how you react when things change in your life,0.19099145
I have to say the first half of the movie really blew me away they do such a great job and explain to you how it slowly develops,0.15514576
the first emotion that comes into Riley's life immediately after she's born is happiness which goes to show that humans are innately happy from the very beginning and then right after about half a minute later comes sadness and that's where babies cry and they feel uncomfortable and it's really fun to see these five emotions slowly come together and work as a team to create great memories for Riley,0.07628155
five main emotions are joy sadness disgust anger and fear and they're all so much fun of course,0.24967624
they're mainly one-dimensional because they're supposed to represent one particular voice of one particular emotion,0.058662243
so right from the beginning,0.05311935
i'm not expecting full development from each of these characters because together they are one great fully developed character which is riley,0.06975456
they just give you such a colorful and you know creative yet so accurate world of how your mind works,0.15061308
so all your character traits are built in link different islands and you have this huge huge sort of area which is your long,0.150418
term memory which is really fun as well and you get to see things like abstract thought know the train of thoughts imaginary land which was probably everybody's favorite,0.056420606
so it's a fun adventure,0.089807935
it's a fun ride throughout the mind of somebody and it's super compelling it keeps you really interested but I feel like after you to know the world pretty well the movie kind of just like slowly decreases in interest and in the element of surprise,0.082632944
I really had a hard time figuring out what it is that I didn't like about the movie when you watch a Pixar movie or at least the ones that I really love,0.0845667
there's just something about them that just really blows you away,0.40773332
and it's not to say that this movie is not incredible that I just didn't get the same feeling,0.081184186
one of the things that really started to put me off the movies that we focus a lot of what's going on inside the mine which is kind of so to speak a technical issue which is now affecting Riley's emotions something goes wrong,0.06573271
I can't really explain it without giving too much away and Riley's reacting to it because you know that's what's happening in her mind,0.14361502
and I first I thought that was great because that's exactly what you go through in this period of time in your life and confused you get angry you're kind of like talking back to your parents,0.41071153
so you're not joyful all the time but then it quickly becomes like we don't know what we're doing in the system,0.08398797
so Riley is reacting kind of like a robot that's the part that I mainly didn't like I understand moments where she should be angry,0.10904695
and anger is taking control of the whole situation,0.09879356
but there are moments where it just doesn't make sense and it does feel like she's just a robot reacting to the buttons these guys are pushing in her mind,0.08111192
there's a moment where she sees this rail and she's super pumped to just slide down it,0.22191606
but then all of a sudden she's not she gets kind of sad and then all of a sudden she's like whoo,0.24209265
yeah,0.040847696
let's do it one more time,0.068650775
those are the kind of things that overall don't make sense and don't feel organic to the process of someone's emotions she doesn't feel like full-fledged character she feels just a little strange in these reactions,0.08215558
I really wish there would have been a bigger balance between what's going on outside of reminder,0.047812082
what's going inside,0.06471818
I don't feel like,0.0932736
there's a lot happening outside for these reactions to have merit sure she's going through a tough time,0.06274356
yes there has been changed but I was expecting more things to happen in her daily life that would marry these sort of strange reactions inside of her head that was kind of a downer because Riley is a really cool character,0.15405099
and I really wanted to see more from her and I really enjoy the moments where you see her but you still hear all the voices for example she goes into room and there's like all these things like Oh what if this happens which is fear and disgust is going like,0.15290187
nope,0.029779838
this is not going to work enjoys trying to be very positive about everything,0.13590917
and thought that was great,0.0644573
because that's exactly how your mind works you have all these different thoughts about a same circumstance,0.15468322
I really enjoyed those moments,0.0877461
and I really enjoyed the animation I mean I think that goes without saying there are times were you seen Riley crying and her expressions are just so accurate and so beautifully done she flushes around her nose and her cheeks when she cries,0.49462393
I thought it was fantastic not to mention that the characters inside her head are just so unique and vibrant and colorful,0.28036466
there's a little detail that I loved that I kind of only noticed enjoy,0.064622045
I didn't know,0.073747076
if I noticed it and the other ones joy skin like the outline is not as defined as the human beings in the movie I can't explain it,0.23490718
i don't want to say pixelated because it's not that,0.105034314
but there is sort of like a softness in a bit of a you know sprinkly kind of look to her skin and she's glowy and I'd kind of like that because i feel like it resembles that she's a bit abstract she's inside her mind she's not a concrete beam,0.3439522
there's many details like that throughout the movie that make it amazing,0.050435793
and of course you noticed that it's Pixar and it's their amazing attention to detail and their original characters that just makes it so fantastic,0.09043311
I let the theatre is really liking the movie thinking that it's really great not one of their best though but that's just my opinion I know people are just raving about it,0.2753547
and they're so enamored with this world that they have created they feel like it's so original maybe it's just my standard reaction to the overhead two reactions of the media that makes it feel kind of uneven,0.066675134
but I just don't think it's as incredible as people are saying it is I think you quickly start noticing that it's really the same formula Pixar has been using for quite a while it's a great formula but you start noticing that it's just something you've seen before,0.085237764
you have the story that starts out really peachy,0.15508015
everything is perfect,0.0725313
but then something happens,0.06055577
and these characters need to go back to a place where they belong like toy story like finding Nemo and then there's the whole dynamic of the two main characters that don't really like they're kind of opposite in so many ways like finding Nemo up Toy Story and at one point something happens the characters get upset one of them ditched,0.09786376
the other like a finding nemo a toy story,0.07603727
but then their room night did they realize they're better,0.06714507
when they're together,0.043299817
they're really good friends do timing doesn't it sound familiar again it's not to say that the movies not good,0.06985205
it's just that the publicity and the reactions have been so high up and so exaggerated when you finally go see the movie the expectations are like all out of whack overall,0.28338414
it's a great movie it's really fun,0.07963071
it gets emotional at certain places which is to be expected,0.05125824
I didn't point it as emotional as other Pixar movies but there's a few moments where you're like okay,0.10304221
you got me pics are I'm crying in the theater,0.35050598
thanks,0.025407692
