This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history.

In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail.

In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not.

But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story.

So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account.

You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids?

Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion.

So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare.

It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook.

Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of.

And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock?

First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple.

And that's because people were camped\noutside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay\nfor two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay\nright now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another\nrelease or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling\nas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. This is Nike building\nthe marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter. (Laughter) That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt. For the brands, sneakerheads\nare a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers;\nthese are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000\nBack to the Future sneakers? (Laughter) Yeah, 8,000 dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market\nis definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much -- (Laughter) Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate -- I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have\nthe exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases. Others have used the data\nto validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. (Laughter) Sneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same\nanalytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those. (Laughter) So an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street\nas it does online, and has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? (Laughter) In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs and later found out\nhe was selling sneakers. (Laughter) And now they use the data\nto do it together. And that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18\nto play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards\nthrough high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's\nusually quite local. For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market\nis about a third. That means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two\nfootwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor. That -- (Laughter) How is that even possible? The sneaker market\nis just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers -- and the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other\ncollectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing and the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street\nand around the block, and sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution. But once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought? What if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places\nonline and off, including every time\nyou walk down the street just hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real. That would surely make you say: [WTF?] Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product, like watches and handbags\nand women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item? What if there was\na stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going. Maybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage, (Laughter) or have earned 162 percent\non your money -- double the S&amp;P and 20 percent\nmore than Apple. (Laughter) And that's why\nwe're talking about sneakers. Thank you. (Applause) This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most\nimportant sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started\nNike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled\nthe entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement\ndid for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear\nwith the Black Cement. It's been right under\nyour nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably\nthinking, \"Sneakers?\" (Laughter) Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly,\nto the future of all online commerce. In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3\nBlack Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes.
