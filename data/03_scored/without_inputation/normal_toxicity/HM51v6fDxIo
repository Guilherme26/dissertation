playlist you'll probably like if you're a fan of film I'll leave a link down,0.14315337
below so the Philadelphia Story was released in 1940 it was directed by a filmmaker,0.09492998
named George Cukor he directed a lot of comedies at the time but he's done,0.0921805
other films as well his best-known movie is the musical my fair lady so in,0.08713794
the Philadelphia Story when a rich husband's ex-husband and a tabloid type reporter turned up,0.10079169
just before her playing remarriage she begins to learn the truth about herself the film,0.09731933
stars Cary Grant Katharine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart but right off the bat I love,0.076949224
the cast in this film Katharine Hepburn plays the snooty rich brat she is easily,0.60484457
probably the best thing about this movie her performance is so larger-than-life and I just,0.1816634
enjoy her bubbly personality on the display in this film it's great seeing her team,0.28123546
up again with Cary Grant I last month I did a review of bringing a,0.047845785
baby which the two were in and they were a fantastic duo and they're once,0.086141504
again good in this film Cary Grant was the ex-husband and as I guess enjoyable,0.12860905
seeing that play out in a sense and Jimmy Stewart plays the tabloid reporter that,0.06832006
goes into trying to mess everything up and her knee marriage and I thought he,0.23537461
was a lot of fun I questioned the fact that the Academy gave him an,0.052123472
Oscar for Rolle yeah Jimmy Stewart won an Oscar of all the movies he was,0.078849055
in for the Philadelphia Story you should have won for it's a wonderful life for,0.057033315
mr. Smith goes to Washington but Philadelphia Story he's solid enough not his best performance,0.071999595
in my opinion I do like the premise on paper on paper this is a,0.104934
wildly entertaining premise it's kind of a satire on the lifestyle of the rich I'm,0.11711129
not gonna lie the third act is where the movie really picks up and there,0.06657891
are some legit funny moments I think what actually got the biggest laugh out of,0.107490815
me without trying to ruin the plot Acacia and seen it there's a scene where,0.13792048
Jimmy Stewart sing somewhere over the rainbow from the woods of Oz not used to,0.0821928
seeing that actor sing before but I thought it was the funniest thing hands down,0.15030432
in the whole film there's also this little girl in the film and actually did,0.09659415
get a few chuckles out of me I thought she was actually one of the,0.17047514
scene stewards of the film my issues with the Philadelphia Story and this is actually,0.059484333
really bad issues I actually think the direction of this film is very bland and,0.28443694
actually knocks a movie down quite a bit as much as I love the cast,0.1997414
it does have some funny moments I just uh never really felt anything in the,0.08962266
direction of this film seem like the movie was on snooze the whole time and,0.09061197
it didn't really go anywhere with its payoff even the comedy in this film for,0.0873688
the most part was very dry everything just seemed like again that snooze button just,0.076309144
won't go off it was probably a thing in the times in 1940's comedy a,0.09420822
lot of it was probably like that and it did kind of feel a little,0.053386237
day in places so it might be just our 21st century guy trying to watch,0.073816955
an older film and I don't think it's really held up well to me the,0.06252588
way the story played out and there's like so many love triangles and stuff played,0.059066862
throughout this film the tone of the film played Mike melodramatic soap opera and I,0.059830613
hate soap opera so for me it didn't really engage me because of that and,0.38039967
that really I really rolled my eyes for most of run time the film also,0.08034953
felt 20 minutes too long two hours is a bit long for a film of,0.105525166
this type I think if you cut about 20 minutes of filler I think it,0.38844955
would have been a better paced film but the other day I'm not the biggest,0.08323908
fan of Philadelphia story I find the film pretty dull and tedious in my opinion,0.28893977
mainly due the bland direction as much as I love the cast and there are,0.08360824
some legit funny moments in places that doesn't excuse the film from being as bland,0.1169401
as it is especially in the direction Department no think George Cukor is that great,0.095066905
of a director of my opinion I'm not the biggest fan of my fair lady,0.15077645
there I do have some issues with that film but the Philadelphia story is to,0.05484193
me at least very lackluster and unpopular opinion I actually enjoy its musical remake which,0.31201804
is considered worse than this film for many people better than the Philadelphia Story which,0.14331274
musical remake is called high society if you're unaware of that for the Philadelphia Story,0.08190922
I'm gonna give it a two and a half out of five stars and on,0.07719166
the under point scale of 47 out of 100 so that was my review of,0.13192543
The Philadelphia Story it's part of my pre 1980 classic review series I tried to,0.06549609
two classics a month the theme of this month is original versus remake I'm trying,0.08674776
to prove that how I would still remake movies even in the goin Age of,0.08084295
Hollywood it's nothing new I don't see this because a lot of people complain about,0.1126938
a lot of the remakes and today's era of filmmaking but Hollywood still remains stuff,0.056916676
even in the Golden Age and before the muff is done I do plan on,0.11008007
reviewing the musical remake of Philadelphia story like I said it's called high society and,0.028487833
it's a very obscure film I can't wait to talk about that Phil if you,0.15999752
guys if you've seen the Philadelphia Story I know I'm in the minority on this,0.082445435
