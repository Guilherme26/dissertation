listen there's not there's going to be no spoilers okay none they're not necessary and you know I'm not I'm not big into kids movies some that I love dearly the Toy Story trilogy wall-e The Incredibles Finding Nemo these these are some kids movies animated kids will is that I I think are  fantastic oh yeah the lego the lego movie almost forgot Jesus Christ this film let's let's let's start with the the negatives for this film I'm just going in on this movie I'm just going in there are no negatives okay the only negatives that I have with this movie was a little short film at the very beginning called lava which visually and like it was fine but the song just just for some reason singing it just it just there's just laying it on thick and just pissed me off at a certain point but a really cute story whatever this film okay that is there are if there are negatives in this film they either I didn't notice them or they were just completely irrelevant and were superseded by the the how by the positives okay this movie is so incredible who in the book had the audacity to think of such a ingenious plot the plot is so ingenious I mean the only thing that I know about the plot going in lets probably like just a basic premise is that this little girl Riley okay inside of her mind the there are these emotions which are the main characters joy sadness fear anger disgust and one day two of these emotions accidentally lose some core memories like somewhere in Riley's brain and these two emotions have to go after these memories which are like orbs they're like in the shape of an orb so like these two motions like have to travel through Riley's brain to find these core memories and just listen this was my melting a kid's movie was mine melting I mean there was some extraordinary I mean this got deep and then the the the music by Michael however you say his name this guy the guy who did the music I lost but the music was outstanding the animation was very creative but seriously the story was just mine melting the whole time there was this one particular moment where there are so many as so many of these moments but there's one particular moment where one character one of the emotions starts crying okay and they yeah yeah and right there they're like holding these memories and they're and and the and the emotion is crying and that seemed was so deep holy the things are running through my mind I was just like damn but how I was thinking about like like my own memories that been like like I haven't thought about in like a long time for one else a little kid like in a long long time you know if they have me thinking about certain dreams just two of them emotions they go through this this this section of Riley the main character of the human little girl these two motions go through a section in Riley's mind where there's like abstract thoughts that the animation was on point I like the light this movie is fantastic I mean it just dude there's whoa they just went deep on this like the way they represented the the subconscious an abstract thought the the way they represented the speed of thought the her her imagination there were islands of her personality whoa man this is like almost this is almost as like what a animated film from Christopher Nolan would look like oh no I don't know what else to say I mean it's bold is originalism it's refreshing it's funny it's really emotional and striking and a masterpiece an instant classic I loved it personally I mean if you didn't like it wolf that you saw a different movie then than what I saw I'm gonna give it a ten out of ten I thought was extraordinary Amy Poehler was fantastic it's joy she really stood out and Lewis Black was really great this anger but Phyllis Smith was great sadness I mean the cast was great the movies great don't see it please do not let this end up like another Enders game okay type of situation go see this movie it is extraordinary okay I'm giving it a 10 out of 10 all right that's all I got honestly what'd you think of it let me know your thoughts down
