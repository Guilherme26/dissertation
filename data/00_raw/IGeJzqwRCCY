[Music] this is no they were stuck that's what he babbling about before Charlie Sheen was tabloid fodder he made some fun movies Hot Shots scary movie three major league platoon unfortunately his work seem to have taken a backseat to his more outlandish behavior winning no yeah did you see that see what are you stupid legalize weed and this is what happens director David toe a bring us a different take on an alien invasion Oh evil in me sorry I'm sorry all right who is that come on who's there why are you people always try areas of them games I agree are you new subscribers no damn it you're terrible will you contribute for the last time if we see one more movie where aliens of the bad guys we're going to do this [Music] well I'm thinking I'm thinking aha okay wait what if I show you a movie where the aliens are the good guy please if you're Macanese would you take this guy seriously how about when the aliens are bit more complex yah this is the arrival [Music] not to be confused with arrival the recent movie starring Amy Adams the arrival is directed by david cowie and stars a pre tiger blood infused charlie sheen we open with lindsay crowds as alana green at scientist checking out an impossibly green patch of grass in the middle of the Arctic global warming or secret area and world of warcraft next up is our hero charlie sheen as geeky astronomer Zane ziminsky at the normal night at work and then suddenly he detects a big signal Wow Jodie Foster never heard anything that cool definitely sky base well 336 you are howling Oh winning the signal fades but Dane signal boner remains but it boss Phil Gordian played by Ron silver does not believe him it lasted 42 seconds and it never repeated in fact they fire him it doesn't please me to be losing the brightest and the best how dare you do your job a look zana the girlfriend sharp played by teri polo don't get used to her you don't see her much until the third act what does she see in him so he gets a new job as a satellite dish installer next thing you know he's linking all the neighborhood dishes together and resume the search for alien life can't imagine why James partner has a rude awakening and I'm not talking about that annoying alarm clock I mean seriously who buys that I have to say although this is pretty illegal and probably impossible it's still a pretty cool setup ah winning then he meets the neighborhood kid Kiki when he catches him lurking outside not the one man what's this Sigma gonna look like just a spike and I got a big but this time it's from the ground the first signal is definitely sky based we verify it but this one is worth based a long one movie at a time please but it's just as short as the previous signal but this time seeing traces it to Mexico road trip first it goes to share the news of this former partner who is now formerly alive once in Mexico a friendly cabbie shows him around including the only radio station in town and the theoretical source of the signal here the trail goes cold he during it back things get a little heavy looks like someone is cutting corners explain that priceline someone is trying to kill him with a bathtub see they're an incompetent assassin or a brilliant plumber see a challenging day so do a lot of humans down here beam catches up with the would-be assassin careful you might have a toilet in his back pocket these traps but he gets away oh jeez wow that makes my knees hurt okay the reveal aliens no doubting it now but when it was just veins paranoia I actually felt more empathy towards them what if this was all in his head what if there was a logical explanation nope aliens are heroes path crosses when Zane runs into a Lada and he also spots a Mexican version of his boss hey Oliver meanwhile back at home gordian hired some gardeners to clean vanes house this sucks seinen Alana go on a date / not date and compare script pages I'm guessing housekeeping in Mexico might be a little buggy I would rather have a mint on the pillow I really enjoyed our talk tonight it was weird she has almost the same haircut as his girlfriend why don't you just stay here now and keep the room tomorrow you made me Sharon somebody wants a glass of tigers blood but he blows her off because winning she goes back alone to her killer scorpion infested room I guess you finally get some action one way or another her night was going to end with a little prick [Music] when Zane finds the source of his radio signal it looks like the thing that kept popping out of Cartman's ass he sneaks into the place which for a super secret alien facility has worse security than costco and he immediately finds a super secret elevator I got lost in the hospital once looking for the bathroom okay aliens look Bailey ins have a disguise machine what's the bet this is going to come in handy I mostly like the original alien design but the chicken legs just don't look right to me well observing the alien mega farting machine he spotted I love that little double take wah buh-bah huh what the [ __ ] that probably some guys doing a job it buzzes I have to do that no time to race they mention it better hurry they have your mug shot we all knew who's going to use this thing to escape Zane is turned into Ron Burgundy sleep around as much as Charlie Sheen this is what happens to you saw the clock winning hilarious if you think this is bad you should see what his last girlfriend has he escapes but he happened to take out one of the aliens who looks like his boss because winning and despite being a wanted criminal in Mexico he makes it back to the US okay ask yourself why an antenna want employee on a deep-space probe or ask how they could launched a six billion dollar telescope without posting experiment and he believes his bought into confessing that the aliens are indeed causing global warming if you can't tend to your own planet none of you deserve to prepare Wow et's judgy Zane secretly records in with a well-hidden yet enormous camcorder hey that works in Porky's to not knowing who to trust and since this was before YouTube the only place with sent the tape out is through a giant radio telescope just keeping the same consistent then gets help from char and Kiki who needs parental permission when you start talking about aliens master plans I mean it's only being killed in Mexico did I mention Gordian and his henchmen arrived to stop them and it turns out that Kiki was working for them the entire time same freezes them all with liquid nitrogen because winning but not before they unleash a giant extra large version of that suck ball yeah I'm going to keep calling it a suck ball they escaped in a pretty heroin sequence at that time looks kind of fun hey Kiki survives so we can send a message to the others you go back and tell them that I know also because Zayn is in no position to threaten Kiki oh then gets a signal out it left the fallen on deaf ears because it's almost 80 degrees in March if this one out on youtube imagine the comment [Music] and that was the arrival ma Charlie Sheen's character is kind of a dweeb but he's a smart guy he doesn't shoot his way out of things he figures out stuff and he's likable char doesn't get to do a whole lot but she don't feed into Zane's paranoia and adds yet another character he's not sure he can trust Ron silver always makes a smooth slimy bad guy and that ball thing was cool the suck ball patent pending I think of a fascinating concept that they reuse human disguises and maybe some are just more popular maybe that's why to pop keeps popping up a lot of dyes halfway through the movie but she's there to fill in some of the pieces of the puzzle for Zane also as a major character her death raises the stakes the filmmakers deliver a dark suspenseful story it's not a typical alien invasion movie I mean who needs space ships when they're already here haven't we seen enough hovering spaceship and that makes the story even creepier they could already be here they're among us and we could be working for some of them right now by the way I'm totally cool with working for an alien and the alien speech sounded sufficiently well alien enough like a language but not one made by human vocal cords I just wanted a bit more of the paranoia angle aliens were confirmed just a bit early for me and there are some odd choices if they nuh nuh Lana or such threats why not just shoot them scorpions and a killer bathtub are they trying to kill a couple of nerds or sixties Batman it's not an action movie it's a thriller Jane thinks his way through things I don't think even touches a gun through the entire movie he does shove an alien off an elevator but that was more of a punch line welcome to earth calilarry but some of the effects do look pretty dated some of the green screen effects especially are pretty bad and I like this one it's a fun movie and I also like that although the ending is a victory it doesn't feel like a happy ending the message is broadcast but now what is it enough can we stop them should we yeah sure so don't think of it as being vilified think of it as being included in our little Hollywood club because at heart audiences love aliens alright fine countdown is ha you mean I saved the world ha Supergirl done you might get over yourself did that really happen Yeah right the right we'll get the winning three out of five it's entertaining and some parts may be predictable but it's still a tense dark thriller that manages to keep you guessing yeah but that knee thing killed me if you liked this video give a thumbs up and subscribe because you know you want to so do you think the aliens have a point leave a comment below this is the nuvi and as always thanks
