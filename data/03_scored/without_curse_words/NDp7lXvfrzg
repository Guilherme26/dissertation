either guys how are you so I feel like I'm the last person on the,0.08378728
internet to see this movie Logan is the third standalone Wolverine movie does anyone remember,0.08455757
that abomination against humanity you probably don't want to remember it because if you do,0.17093419
it'll give you nightmares and some people like that movie and that's okay but I,0.31089434
think it's a big bloated pile of and it almost ruined the entire franchise of,0.24831586
overeating well we got this movie so it makes up for no with that said,0.089034
check out my awesome new Wolverine t-shirt these are located at mighty public store I'll,0.1525473
put the link down below I have like nine new Wolverine t-shirts I picked up,0.1958892
it just felt necessary and to be honest with you I actually couldn't decide which,0.09129128
Wolverine t-shirt to wear for this movie review watch this old clip from 2013 where,0.106744796
I kill x-men origins Wolverine and I'm going to go switch my t-shirt I'll be,0.8355208
right back I think I like this one a little bit more alright so Logan,0.09312593
is directed by James Mangold who also directed the second Wolverine movie titled the Wolverine,0.043588895
and as far as that movie goes I don't think it's a bad movie it's,0.13337211
slightly entertaining but it's just a very forgettable movie in the Wolverine franchise because by,0.07132482
the third act of silver samurai turns into a Decepticon and you're just like what's,0.47936165
happening now let's talk about the movie Logan this film is based on the old,0.09890407
man Logan comics and it takes place in the near future where everything in this,0.10241948
universe has went downhill and by the way just on a quick nerdy side note,0.31089434
why can't they just give Wolverine his suit for one movie they almost did it,0.12794363
in the last movie almost and it's like I get it you can't have Hugh,0.09280654
Jackman running around and yellow spandex but and this will be Logan Wolverine is old,0.12953967
he's grizzled he's beaten down he's tired he doesn't want to do this anymore because,0.37077436
now when he gets shot or stabbed he doesn't heal instantaneously he's more vulnerable he,0.55479676
can't really take a beating like he used to I mean he still has adamantium,0.31089434
claws that can heal eventually but there's a larger sense of danger there when he's,0.06649845
in these situations and it puts you on the edge of your seat a little,0.100479
bit more so yeah let me get this out of the way before we continue,0.3072067
on if I was writing the script for this movie I would have made part,0.07489792
of the script or maybe a plot point to where since he healing slower maybe,0.05635397
he does have to get a suit of armor somehow some way to go into,0.06698966
the final climax of the movie in that suit of armor might look something like,0.06443676
this I don't know I just get Wolverine of yellow spandex I want it all,0.43055546
right let's get back to the plot of the movie but by the way if,0.082811244
you guys agree with me let me know down below in the comment section and,0.21251404
as far as the overall vibe of this movie goes and has a very post-apocalyptic,0.15284938
western vibe and I loved it I just love the way that this movie looked,0.09305411
and the way that it felt with the scenery and the settings in this film,0.06753544
had a very immersive vibe to it but now let's talk about Charles Xavier played,0.08199891
by Patrick Stewart and in this film Charles Xavier is not doing too well he's,0.12662429
suffering from a mental illness where it confuses him and sometimes when you combine that,0.4445436
with his mutant powers where he uses his mind it's a disaster waiting to happen,0.4033243
and that whole aspect plays a very large part in this movie and I really,0.06185373
enjoyed that because everything is very unstable at times and there's a few really intense,0.109183475
situations where Wolverine is the only guy who can step in and save the day,0.11630501
now the best way I can describe Logan this is a comic book movie for,0.08764273
people who don't like comic book movies now don't get me wrong I love comic,0.24217877
book movies can you tell look at all that back there but more often than,0.06420094
not comic book movies are over produced they're over budgeted they're over scripted they're just,0.08856235
a big bloated CGI mess of just random explosions and just happening for the sake,0.24807937
of happening this movie at times almost feels like an independent action movie with great,0.082164116
character moments but it just so happens to feature the character of Wolverine and that's,0.059721086
the biggest praise I can give this movie it feels like a real movie and,0.10661431
not just a comic book movie I'll be honest with you going into this movie,0.122843996
that was my fear because I almost thought it might be underwhelming and not quite,0.24089253
give me that comic-book aspect of that epicness and those berserker attacks I was looking,0.32373706
for but I am happy to say the Wolverine fanboy inside of me was very,0.076026596
happy five minutes into this movie because you realize they are definitely utilizing that rated,0.14964524
R rating and they're giving you the Wolverine we've all been waiting 17 years to,0.05308069
see isn't crazy hugh jackman has been this character for 17 years and I think,0.3120294
with Logan this is probably the best portrayal of the character we've seen yet and,0.025120938
most importantly we get those hardcore rated or Berserker attack scenes we've all wanted to,0.15413097
see that's right 78 people get decapitated in this movie with adamantium claws from a,0.40335795
storytelling standpoint everything that happens in this movie with the action and the blood the,0.15406857
guts from the gore and the violence it all blends together so well and in,0.48393795
between all those things you have characters and you understand these characters so when they're,0.05074639
in these intense situations you actually care about what's happening to them and out of,0.09115716
all the x-men movies I would say this movie have some of the best character,0.1128625
moments and there's a few very sad dramatic scenes between Charles Xavier and Logan to,0.12495772
this movie and the chemistry between these two guys it's great now let's talk about,0.097890325
the little badass who does berserker attacks in the movie and her character's name is,0.3572681
Laura but this little girl was awesome she was well-written and there are scenes where,0.17339219
she kicks a lot of ass and it gets like just a little girl dangling,0.9156528
on wires of special effects helping her do these things and as far as movies,0.13175361
go the best thing I could do to compare to her character in the movie,0.10024935
Logan is she's almost like Hit Girl from the kick-ass movies she still does a,0.7093121
lot of the scenes in the movie so yeah I really liked the character of,0.04775444
Laura in this movie now with all that said I do have a few complaints,0.0794577
with the movie now this we does have a few antagonists that go up against,0.07660286
Wolverine because we'll really need somebody to fight and I thought for the most part,0.1277526
as far as the storytelling standpoint goes they were sufficient they did their job but,0.03840643
I also thought they were both very bland and one of the antagonists in this,0.18201627
film almost feel like it was just tossed in there because hey we need another,0.077145785
badass for Wolverine to fight so let's just do this now does that mean it's,0.44777986
bad no I really enjoyed their final showdown in the movie I really thought it,0.13050443
was well done and awesome to watch but I sort of wanted something else and,0.04037577
one other thing I didn't necessarily love about this movie is during the third act,0.05538856
of the movie the big climax is happening things are going down the action is,0.11197872
ramping up I got to score that was backing all this up wasn't very good,0.10746259
when it comes to musical film scores I think they can really intensify the action,0.06086706
that happening up on the screen and during the third act of this movie or,0.080909565
people or running around in the woods it almost felt discombobulating it just feel like,0.08434383
random noises happening and it didn't really build up the situation as much as I,0.05391447
wanted it to you take other movies like Batman Begins of the Dark Knight you,0.097508155
hear that Hans Zimmer score and it builds up and it escalates the sequence and,0.071499266
amazing scores like that almost give you a little goosebumps down your arm you guys,0.4735719
know I'm talking about but during the third act of this movie that score that,0.068341315
they play it just didn't really do anything for anything happening up on the screen,0.09401597
I thought it almost took it down a notch so now here are my final,0.07010487
thoughts on Logan first things first I think we got by saying Deadpool because it,0.06068905
took a chance and it was one of the best rated our comic-book movies that,0.05489619
made a lot of money because of the success of Deadpool Fox Studios said wow,0.074882306
we can put our head down of our asses and actually make movies that go,0.8864033
for and aren't watered down because as far as comic-book movies go there are just,0.08482808
some stories that need to be rated R to give the viewing audience the best,0.034647625
possible movie they can and once again I love Deadpool it's rated R it was,0.07260443
awesome it was a blast to watch but when it comes to films movies like,0.11772399
Logan evoke emotions out of me they made me feel something they make me feel,0.12042983
sympathy or a feeling of sadness and other times when Wolverines getting beat to and,0.18854636
he's down on his knees and he's about to give up that one little ounce,0.42630023
of energy fire is up inside of him and his claws come out he kicks,0.32505426
everyone's ass and I love moments like that so a movies that evoke emotion out,0.9038004
of me are just my preference for movies and that right there is why I,0.0480559
think Logan is probably the best rated our comic book movie ever made so I'm,0.056489315
going to give logan hara a solid a this isn't a perfect movie it has,0.14377582
flaws there was room for improvement but after watching the movie i wanted to watch,0.08638202
it again and very a few movies do that for me the movie Logan definitely,0.061706714
goes for it at times and I respect things like that so that's my take,0.09595818
