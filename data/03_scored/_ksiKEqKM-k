talking about the favorite which I'm so pumped about because this movie is awesome it's,0.077950865
weird it's kind of gritty you don't really know am I supposed to laugh at,0.115696065
this is it supposed to be funny and it's dark it's it's everything that I,0.1095319
wanted from it and more I mean you you watch the previews and you know,0.09414263
that the gals are gonna deliver but this movie when you leave it I'm telling,0.0913859
you you're gonna be like how many Oscars is this gonna win because it is,0.07877347
bomb and I can help wait to talk about it so stay tuned to hear,0.30272323
my thoughts and of course cue the intro all right so let's dive into this,0.077052265
thing you guys know that I love tea and whenever I want to talk about,0.1515714
Old English Victorian all those things there's nothing like a cup of tea my personal,0.31089434
favorite is green tea and but English tea times okay they're T's okay but green,0.10689554
teas a little bit better so let's dive into this thing right so the movie,0.08205546
is about which is based on a true story that I didn't know when I,0.038608395
was going into the film basically it's about this this monarch Queen Anne and back,0.11280138
in the early 1700s she was ruler and but she was best friends with this,0.0833059
girl named Sarah Churchill who is related to Winston Churchill was explained sort of a,0.07147995
lot in terms of their diplomatic excellency and so she's best friends with Queen Anne,0.09770759
and honestly this is true story she had so much influence in court with the,0.053895686
Whigs and with how the Queen would make her decisions and she was very dominant,0.1073306
she's a cold cold person but you could tell she really loved the Queen but,0.25451207
she also loved her influence as well so everything's getting along real well and things,0.10642459
are going great until she finds out that her cousin whom she's never really met,0.3214585
before it's kind of down and out her name's Abigail Hill and she's like alright,0.20327963
um honestly it's a little bit embarrassing that I have this cousin who is basically,0.31089434
you know has a is living in the mud somewhere so I'm gonna allow her,0.53490317
to come to and meet the Queen and become a chambermaid and give her a,0.18895335
job so Abigail Hill is played by Emma Stone and I didn't mention that Sarah,0.080989875
Churchill is played by Rachel Weisz and the Queen Anne is played by Olivia Colman,0.054737967
and so then she allows her cousin to come in and she was not expecting,0.18003605
however that her cousin would be loved by the Queen and then her cousin would,0.21785596
it be just as cunning as she is and that's where all the tea starts,0.1047197
to spill because oh my gosh there's just so much going on it is just,0.14427914
it's just wonderful because they both want the Queen's influence and Sarah is so used,0.04985201
to being HBIC like she looks at Abigail like she's nothing Abigale used to at,0.24254909
some point be a lady but her father fell into her times or something and,0.16892356
she ended up being sold to to someone else and she's no longer lady even,0.2441568
though she was trained to be a lady so in her mind she's looking at,0.15922216
the Queen and this opportunity like hey I get I could possibly get to be,0.08634505
a lady again I get to be in the court I get to meet all,0.11527146
these fabulous men and suitors like I'm not gonna just sit here and let Sara,0.097616464
run all over me and and not take hold of the opportunity and at first,0.23963808
she's really loyal because she thinks that sara is a good person but she's not,0.16912271
and then it all unfolds and unravels and I will leave it there because seriously,0.1447201
guys this drama I was thinking this could have been like a 10 part series,0.15381183
it's fascinating it's so good so let's get to the performances like if Olivia Colman,0.15065278
does not win Best Actress I'll be shocked I mean not only her performance in,0.09884261
terms of emotion vocally like a lot of her bodily performance was impressive as well,0.18477727
because Queen Anne had issues with gout she had a stroke and a lot of,0.13038029
that is physical performance she's also known to be ill throughout her life she gained,0.3224705
a lot of weight later on in her time and it's just I mean Olivia,0.24208356
puts on like a tour de force of what it means to become a role,0.10951453
and how to carry it out on film it's it's crazy and then when you,0.4227054
get Emma Stone and Rachel vice I mean they're just like butting heads they really,0.3940394
play well off of each other the director Rachel vice said that the director told,0.042836662
them please don't read up on your too much history on your actual characters because,0.13869657
a lot of this I won't give exactly what away but some of its fictional,0.1038171
it's just to play up how Abigail and Sarah butted heads but a lot of,0.43414903
it's pretty true so not only is it is it a great film to watch,0.13696183
to see sort of a piece of history and watch how it all unfolds and,0.058874786
then also just the performances are incredible I mean I honestly don't know who's gonna,0.10875177
win between Emma Stone and Rachel vice because they both kick ass and so then,0.9017832
let's talk about the overall style and how the film looks it's strange because you,0.08557126
know that this is based on a true story when I watch this I wasn't,0.047953583
sure because it's so it's almost Tarantino esque in the sense that he will take,0.07870692
a history story but he'll kind of like flip it in his own way to,0.0750471
make it comical and you're not sure am I supposed to laugh at this I,0.19278057
don't know how I'm supposed to be feeling but it's dark it's edgy it's so,0.17681527
different than anything you guys have watched this year you guys have got to check,0.11073473
out this movie wide-angle lenses lots of there's just just how everything is framed and,0.07014614
there's these court and the costumes are gorgeous and all the rooms that they're in,0.11160536
and the palaces are amazing like seriously go see this on the big screen so,0.078107856
you can really look at all the details and enjoy what it means to watch,0.093695626
film that's what this movie is between the acting the sets the directing everything that,0.08449842
you want from a film is in this movie and I know I'm really selling,0.13049169
it and I kind of like weird things I'm not gonna tell you guys this,0.1874243
movie is not weird but there's symbolism there it's a movie that I think will,0.071230054
be taught in a film school because there's so much underlying tones and a lot,0.054565445
of things that are going on and I cannot wait to see it again so,0.06658997
I highly recommend go this weekend I know these next couple weeks we have so,0.053071722
