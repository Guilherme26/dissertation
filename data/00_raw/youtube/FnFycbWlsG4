[Music] hey guys we just got back from an early showing of spider-man into the spider verse and I gotta say whoa it's really really good yes I thoroughly enjoyed it was funny it was had a great story you guys must go out and watch this film yeah it's great I really liked it I think it's one of the best if not the best animated film of 2018 III was really uh you know encouraged by the trailers and and mostly what's that one movie where the best part of the movie was the this trailer break up that showed spider-man at the end and early showing or something like that and boy I could tell you man I am just blown away about how good this is this is pretty much as close as you can get to simulating a comic book on screen yeah I really like the animation uh I know you before you saw the trailer you like I don't know about this whole kind of animation how did you feel about that one yeah so that was something that I was knowing yeah I was really worried about it I freaking hated and I said I hate it hate it hate it and no matter what I'm gonna hate it but as I was watching it you kind of get used to it now do I do I and so and overall it wasn't an issue you get used to it and you're into it and things work out and by the end you don't really notice it but would it have been better if it was flowing animation maybe but it's just that that.oh sees you in my brain from from computers and low frame rates and you just see the like the big said somebody can fix this but i swear to god you get used to it and you won't notice it anymore the story really engages you and it involves you and honestly I'm not gonna say this lightly there are moments in this movie that are literally a work of art I mean this is a creatively driven movie thing you know what I'm saying it's just comic-book movies have kind of started to get a little say me I mean we've had 18 of them with Marvel films and we've had bad ones with DC and some good ones and and they kind of adhere to a formula this one kind of throws the formula out the door I mean this one seems to be able to take risks and and they pay off in my opinion what do you guys think about about that yeah I think that well it's a different it's a different medium entirely right could they get to do more things because it's animated so we had longer more drawn-out fights that just would cost you know hundreds of millions of dollars if it was real with CGI and so we get to see some really like really exciting scenes like action sequences in this this film we wouldn't normally yeah and for me it's one of the better spider-man films that I've seen I just have not seen homecoming so what do you guys other spider-man's that have seen started falling this one it's bringing the Spider Man bringing back to Spider Man yeah it's surprisingly deep complex even maybe overly complex for children now we went to a screening and they brought in a lot of kids as well this is it's like 9:00 in the morning right now I'm barely away guys but but you know I luckily they were quiet you know but but I thought it was surprisingly deep complexed and it had a sort of a you know mature jokes from tongue I wouldn't say mature jokes but adult jokes it probably would fly over the heads of kids here and there of course they've got the funny stuff as always but I was really happy with how it's not you know sort of dumbed down or appealing just to the stupidity or the dumb parts just fart jokes fart yeah you know when you're watching a bad animated film it starts to do that crap this does this tells yeah this tells a complex story an interesting story and there are a lot of characters in here okay we're not gonna spoil it for you we're gonna talk about it and in spoilers but you've seen the characters in the trailer so we have you know we got Peter Parker we got Gwen Stacy noir spider-man which is Nicolas Cage I was also to see you have like an anime spider-man and then you have a porker Peter porker yeah I don't know his name but so what did you guys think of this whole spider-man team-up thing though there was a lot of spider-man like there were pretty much well developed like they all had the little quick things but it was great that is funny though my favorite turned out to be Peter porker after I got like [ __ ] for it I was like this is too cartoony I did a vlog news oh yeah so I felt he was kind of disappearing in there and I was like what is the point of view to porker I was more into noir spider-man but I know the moment you talk about where they make a fun of the fact that he's a cartooning goes off so that that is a standout moment of the film yeah they do have other cameos in fact well we'll talk about it in spoilers but cameos that you might guess and cameos that you maybe may not guess and little Easter eggs I should say for for that if you're a fan of the game there are Easter eggs so yeah just overall really well done the writing in particular I thought was very good when they made a joke I was laughing now I say this film route starts real strong to me like you know it kind of throws a lot at you but it's easy to understand you're involved you're engaged I think towards the end of the second act and the third act they're still throwing jokes in there but I'm not I didn't laugh I wasn't laughing at those jokes but I was still fully entertained you know what I mean so I didn't matter at all to me that you know everybody was hilariously laughing in the audience and I was like oh really good because the action was so awesome I just I liked how they can go exaggerated because there are exaggerated moments in the film the the villains you have a nice new spin on Goblin on the villains in the universe because this is an alternate dimension Miles Morales so what did you guys think of the title character Miles Morales he's our first african-american slash Latino spider-man and hero yes he's Puerto Rican I'm about to beat you up if you say that but he's actually not the first Latino spider-man that somebody else and you probably don't know but I do know what do you think about this one I liked it I thought I was gonna be like kind of annoyed like little he's gonna be like teenage drinks kind of thing but it was all great and he act like an adult and took matters into his own hand when he needed to they I was worried that they were going to because he's new right he's a newer like as far as like his him having the powers he's a newer spider-man and I was worried that they're gonna be like oh he can't do it and him you know dwelling on the fact that he wants to prove himself over and over and sometimes movies with with teenage main characters they really stress it to the point where it's annoying I get it you want to prove yourself like get it you want to prove yourself they didn't do that they had just the right amount of time and they developed him as a character and they didn't fall into some of the pitfalls that a lot of these teen led movies fall into yeah you really believe that the his teenage lifestyle where his family loves him you can tell his father loves him his mother loves him you could see that we get a little bit of the the sort of Peter Parker school stuff we get a little bit of that with Miles Morales just with a spin on it in school and worrying about what people think of him and things like that of course you know it's miles and so it's slightly different it's all it's all really really fun because you get to see a spider-man origin story with a different take on it and and it's it hits some familiar beats but yet it's all unique and we see that over and over because when we see and and I don't say that as a negative thing because you think you'd get sick of it because they say we got to start at the beginning cuz every time somebody's introduced they're like we got to start at the beginning and that's funny yeah yeah but it goes real quick and you're interested in in their little backstories I'm gonna see where they come from and I think the story from Miles Morales has done there are so many references to his comics they do him justice this like I said not only visually is a great adaption of a comic book style just flowing and it works perfectly there but also some of the storylines and themes and and origin stories of Miles Morales so I think they nailed they absolutely nailed it is great voice acting across the board what was the day Joe you know this the guy from new girl the Peter Parker Johnson Jack Johnson yeah yeah yeah but at first I didn't I was like that's not Peter Parker but I got used to his voice oh don't like okay so I I was skeptical about that but he convinced me later on he did his job really well though I heard behind the scenes that they were going to have Tobey Maguire at one point voice one of these spider-man and you'll see which one and now I think they're kicking themselves like they got read in any of you or like it probably could have probably worried yeah but I think it win the discussion with movie theaters they thought that maybe it would be too confusing for audiences because it's like what universe is this spider-man from but it's not confusing because if you look at the start it's clearly telling you what universe is from it's showing references and scenes from Tobey Maguire spider-man so what are you little jabs Tobey put out a commentary track where you do this voice just for free do it and then when I get my DVD cuz I'm gonna buy this DVD I'll put that on there so that the so that we get a little bit of Tobey up in the movie because this was great man I'm totally buying this as you can see what about some of these subplots as you feel that anything was out of place in the movie or did you feel that all the sub blocks sort of strengthened it well I didn't so what what's great about the subplots in this film is they didn't feel like subplots because they were all actually involved and they were important they didn't feel like we were going off on little missions to go take care of this for no reason or go do something over here to take care of that they were all actually important to the development of all the different characters so they didn't really feel like subplots so I think they did a really good job yeah we get everything the purpose didn't bother me at all mhm we get villains that we've seen in Miles Morales this universe and and I honestly I thought that because maybe they were it was a kid's film or something that they were gonna change some of the story beats of Miles Morales for example the fate of spider-man in in Miles Morales is universe but they didn't pull any punches you know and and that gave the move the film emotional impact were you guys emotionally did you feel any emotion and did you did okay well that's mark of a good film and it's not just that moment from from his sort of origin story there are other moments that are earned by the film man this is good not only is it in my opinion the best animated film if I'm correct of 2009 18 but it's it's one of the best films of 2018 in my opinion so if you're a huge fan of spider-man you're really gonna do you you're gonna freak out this is him shown in a completely different way it's it's so nice and refreshing to see all these different spider characters I didn't realize I knew that there were alternate universes and I knew they've been doing other stuff with like Wednesday there's Marge oh yeah I know there's a future man there's there's other spider-man and you know so I just think you know and this is a complete story - they don't try to sequel bait and if they never make another one of these into the spider-verse movies this thing stands alone because of how good this is only if they get the same writers because that dialogue is so strong that the jokes are so smart and the references are like the right references a sequel bit a little bit I don't know the very like we won't get into spoilers but they definitely see well that is not in the film that is an after credits no no there's absolutely something in the film itself for their sequel baiting okay no it's no that's not what a sequel bait is it's complete freaking story doesn't shove it in your face at you like oh man and now I need to see the next one actually get the real story it's nothing like that it's really really satisfying this one just the animations great the voice acting is great the writings great the creative direction is great what else do you need okay so let's go with final verdicts let's start with Joe I really enjoyed this one the plot was great like you said the animation I'd like to come work style I want to see more of these I really hope this apart to 910 yeah I think this is this is it's got a couple things that I wouldn't call like flaws in the film the things I would like to see a little bit more of and because I didn't get to see some of those things that are only I mean this is almost a 10 out of 10 film from this oh it's really really close yeah well yeah I mean where did y'all where did you miss the points well without putting too much into it there was they kind of resolved the main story kind of quickly I mean things just kind of fell into place and I mean it's already two hour long film I have wanted ten more minutes at that especially during the climax of the film just to kind of feel like we resolved everything it just kind of felt like we got to the we got to where we needed to get to things kind of resolved and then I mean it took a little while with it but it didn't feel like it had the big the big ending that I really really wanted yeah so I think that's why I get set 9 but it's really high 9 for me yeah yeah it starts so strong it's really tight and focused on miles and then when other spider characters start to come in it gets it gets busy and it's not a negative busy but you still have to mention that it gets busy there and you're like well actually guys you did such a good job on miles I kind of want to see more of miles build up separately from the other characters and and that but they do integrate it so well his origin story with the other characters that you can't really be mad at it the the villains were good I think you know some of the you know you've seen some of them in the trailer but maybe you could ramp that up just a tiny bit but yeah they were villains though they were good they were relatable they're not like evil for evils sake which I always have such a hard time buying like they they were they were really good villains and that's something that's hard to do and a lot of these comic book films don't do a very good job with them animated film actually I'm keepin remind me of the guy from I thought it was cool I was like this is a different looking kingpin and I liked his design it's ridiculous but that man has some power and you know what it was invoking a daredevil Netflix's daredevil and what kingpin cares about most in that film is kind of here in this film and referencing this man that's in the comics as well so just well-done across the board I am trying to find reasons to to give it a 9 but honestly I'm trying to find reasons not to give it a 10 you know what I mean and why should I be doing that I think that it's a 9 out of 10 but what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna go ten out of ten on I don't fault you for it either and the reason why I'm going at ten out of ten is because I think it is such a wild success for creative minds for different directions for different animation styles for just style this film oozes style and honestly at first I was not I was skeptical of it and I was like I don't want this you got a bunch of rap music you got the shitty framerate animation I wanted to come in like a crabby Joe but it convinced me and I like the soundtrack there yeah I know I'm saying I like the dang soundtrack by the end of the film and it gives this Spider Man his own unique feel to it and man it's just a fantastic film and I'm so happy that you know a character like Miles Morales who when he first released you have of course you had bigots and idiots you know saying you know talking about how forever and always forever and always but also you have weinerman Fez look I don't want to news I don't want to spider-man and they kind of [ __ ] him because he's not spider-man he's not the spider-man or whatever and over time the they embraced him because they would read them in the stories are you really good no he's yes and so for them to also get his movie correct I think is a great thing for all of Spider fandom and for everybody out there that you know loves superhero movies and in an inspirational story of trying to be the best that you can be so this film has a good message and it's just great all around so I highly recommend you go out and see this in theaters when it comes out what a what a badass success from Sony you know I I just didn't expect that from them you know they it's been a while yeah I mean after what they did with with venom which venom is fun but it's not like my venom super face is so super faithful to the venom character other than some of his wackiness and and it's live action so they have that restriction this and I gotta say this okay I always say this DC animation is number one it's superb they're always kicking [ __ ] ass not ninja Bevan but here comes shut up with the ninja but here comes [ __ ] Marvel with like our freaking bazooka and they just nailed this if Marvel's animation is now gonna be at this level I know this is Sony when you know in collaboration with Marvel but way more of these please way more cuz just great alright guys so if you want to stick around for spoilers which I don't know why you would want to do that because this reviews coming out early but if you want to we'll talk about some of the plot points and you can end the video now and then wait till this comes out and then come back to the video and watch the spoilers that'd be cool too so thank you so much for watching and we shall see you on the next angry Joe show yes hey guys welcome to the spoiler section where we can talk about all the nitty gritty here so jumpers jump right into this this equal bait that you think what are you talking about because they will talk about the end credits scene that's after all the credits but what do you mean so he lies down at the very not that in the movie not before the credits so like before the credits start to roll he's like lying down he puts a sticker on a big metal eagle yes and then he lies down in bed and puts on his headphones and then she starts spider-gwen starts talking to him no I I didn't what what does she say but hi hi it's Gwen do you have a time like it was like two seconds long did I [ __ ] miss now fully sign in my life might take it or something what it's like okay well then that's not a sequel bait if it's literally 2 seconds long it's like a they still communicate okay they don't misunderstand the definition of what I see well what do you think it's equal bait is a sequel bait is when it's like literally all you don't you don't get to fight the final villain and he disappears and Hank you fight is Noah's lieutenant and then and then and then at the end of the film he comes through the portal and it's lucky now we're gonna fight but yes that's an over a huge sequel bait but they're definitely baiting that there's gonna be more of these films coming I hope if they can talk if they can talk transdimensional II then then I think that's I don't think that that's weird because I don't think that matches up with the film and if it does then that's a weird sequel bait because she doesn't have that technology well yeah we source there was nothing Ben should not have that technology neither does miles and the the only person smart enough capable of that is two people even the anime spider-man which she goes back to her own universe so I unless you built one for everybody and then threw them through the portals but though we got to talk about the end credits scene which is quite possibly the funniest you have so I don't know see it sucks because I don't know in the main review did I mention there's an after credits you did here okay cool so now we're gonna spoil it and basically it's what is memes yes it's spider-man 2099 Miguel is you know he has the technology and apparently another no it's not a goober it's a device it's a gizmo this time which is gonna allow him to travel between the vs. safely or whatever and so he travels into the next he's like I'm gonna go to the beginning and they go into the 1960s cartoon late sixties cartoon and they do this meme that we've always seen on reddit in other places the spider-man pointing it's like why are you born again and he's like come with me III need your elvers like it made the whole theater erupted and laughter and I do hope that we do get to see spider-man 2099 and she had even Spiderman the 90s I wanted same animation that whenever he comes back yeah okay some of the Easter eggs there the Sony ps4 spider-man suit is seen in the background in one of the glass cases multiple ones well there are also comic book suits and so there are in glass cases on to me in the in this particular universe is revealed like she's almost like Alfred she's got this shed that turns into a spider cave with all this advanced technology and she helps Miles Morales make his suit or help him find his his suit and his skills so that was really cool and but what we do want to talk about so the emotional impact we were saying on what made you emotionally impacted their job he just had a motional connection with his uncle like they don't you got along and his dad didn't get along with his uncle right he was still it's like his uncle was going down the wrong path maybe yeah they really explain it much but it's revealed that you know his uncle is the Prowler house and that's it the way that it is in the comics and the and the problem I thought that the honker knew who he was cuz come on he's a Spider Man you can see in there but I guess not he just thought if some punk kid he's gonna kill some kid and then when it's revealed that it's his nephew he's like oh no you know not only does he hesitates he makes a decision to not do it he gets shot in the [ __ ] back and miles picks up his body and he and gets him out of there because you know this is a big epic fight with scorpion doc ock who's a female Liz or something live and and tombstone I think it is I'm not sure I I'm not sure that that doubles go though yeah the the guile clone looking guy yeah and and they have this big fight in all maze cuz miles got a little sloppy and led them there but anyway so he manages to get prowler you know separated from the main group and you know his father rolls up on them as as his uncle dies and it's a touching scene and then and then you have the whole thing with you know the the brother going up to his brother and seeing his brother die and he saw that separation they did he doesn't want the same to happen with Miles so he tries to go into contact miles yeah and the other one that I was talking about is at the beginning of the film towards the beginning of the film where miles is thrown right into the middle of a battle he sees his versus universe's Peter Parker who's this perfect Peter Parker he's like the best spider-man of all time and he loses to you know not only this Collider technology but also the kingpin they they [ __ ] literally murder his ass and and right and it's touching right before because he's all messed up but he's like you think you can get out of it but he's like I need you to promise me that you're gonna shut down this machine and you're like me and and you take this device and and and then they kill him and so that gets an emotional reaction because not only do you see it with his own supporting characters but you see the whole city mourn spider-man's death and that's what you don't flow handled and it was in the comics so I'm not mad you know throwing out a spider-man death like I was mad about Superman's death if they didn't earn it that's that's a part of Miles Morales growth that he owes it to his Peter Parker to you know sort of continue this legacy so it's really handled very very well um Doc Ock has revealed you knows you think it's just as weird and happy maybe scientist lady or whatever he and then she turns into Doc Ock and you're like oh [ __ ] kickin [ __ ] ass keepin kingpins story was handled really well that he's not doing anything evil he's actually just trying to pull his is why his dead wife and son from an alternate dimension and just kind of steal them so he can have them again because they died in this universe yeah so he's not just trying to be a jerk or just trying to make money I mean spider-man wants to stop him because he'd been a worm to open a black hole and kill everybody but I think I think oh well to any even even the fact that he is a [ __ ] jerk because like even his family notices you're beating the [ __ ] out of spider-man and now you're beating [ __ ] out of this other spider-man we don't want anything to do stop trying to pull us into this universe we get away from us and it's it's that so he takes out his anger and aggression and emotions out on our spider-man and you know they highlight Miles Morales his powers for those of you don't know he's not just a standard spider-man he has unique spider-man powers that no other spider-man has had he could turn invisible he also has a little bit of telekinesis what's not call that it's something Kinesis type of powers that he can use oh they called it a venom strike or something like that I don't think it's called venom strike in the actual comics but now I'm not sure cuz I don't read a lot of Miles Morales his stuff though I definitely want to now he's black and red man now is the time like right now is the time to start buying all of the original brown stuff because once everybody sees this movie they're gonna buy all yeah it's really cool and I'm I'm happy and it's sort of like we're you know Nightwing you know becomes his own character and everybody likes him she's a badass but now we've got you know another spider-man that it's fun to see him and he's been in a lot of recent media for spider-man so it's cool to see him get his own movie like you know the spider-man video game he's in that and I'm pretty sure he's going to be featured in the next spider-man video game they teased a little bit of that I hope to see venom in that one by the way so and I hope does he maybe venom in the next into the spider-verse film - no not Tom Hardy's version though they could if they wanted to because now they hit they could play with so much the fact that they have all these different versions and now that this one did so well maybe they could do some flashbacks and get Toby to voice the original Peter Parker because that's who so actually the this Peter Parker is overweight he's depressed he's into it we go from perfect to everything that could happen everything goes wrong worst loss Mary Jane kind of yeah but that first perfect Peter Parker that was who they were going to get but I think they just reused his voice the other Peter B Parker but yeah so um what else what else for I like the fact that is as father as a cop in this universe now you have sort of like a Commissioner Gordon thing that they could be doing together I'm looking forward to working with you I love you and he takes off and because he doesn't know they thinks it's some other kid I don't think they did the reveal a change though because I get first thing his dad hated spider-man yeah not only did he hate spider-man for the vigilante thing because you're a cop and you you little jealous of the fact it's spider-man is doing he's getting all the credit but also because at one point he thinks the spider-man is the one that killed his brother you know miles analysis uncle because he's lying over him as he's given his dying words then takes off so yeah just well well done the the side characters didn't really have like they try to really milk the fact that the robot lady anime lady lost her robot and it didn't really go anywhere it was just like this small little thing just to try to get more remote I was like okay now you're being just now you're just being manipulated you know like the sad puppies fans you don't need to go that far but no she was super sad about that thing and then you know ten minutes later she was billeted buts her if her father died and that was that was his robot no it's well that's true and she does build a new robot but she's still got the spider with her that she has a telepathic link to yeah that's the only spider that they didn't [ __ ] kill us I wonder what she would think about about all the other Spider Man this yeah they killed it miles is just like it and he has it doesn't even hurt him you expect this like great reactions but it does power transfers and stuff they never explain where that spider comes from because this is technically miles Browns universe where there already was a beauty parlor who already got bit so how the spider had the the name of the the lab then they break into it has they printed the lab was pretty close by cuz he was funny Green Goblin yeah correct but you know I think I thought in his story it was like made by Norman Osborn Osborne's stuff that he made a bunch of those different spiders and and they got loose but I could be wrong about that but yeah I'm sure you'll hear about in the comments yeah but just fantastic you don't have to know all the comic book lore to really enjoy this and you will come out knowing a lot of the you know best and character beats from each one of these spider-man from their universes what about your Nick pics though new pics [Music] well I already kind of mentioned them in the review what about yours I I wanted more out of like the final fight because the they kind of get to kind of get there and then they just like plug the thing in and there's it takes him a while to get there but punching and kicking between kingpin I thought it was good because it's like they're always wanting to help him help him help him help him and then at the end as I could take a leap of faith in me that I can handle this on my own and he goes out there any kicks is that yeah it just didn't feel like a big final fight it felt like there's a lot of stuff happening because the the beams were going off and there's like city's being melded together and things like that but it didn't feel like the like an end boss it just it was just really a fistfight between Miles Morales and kingpin at the very end that's what pin does and so I was did you want the fist fight to be more an extended well they were like scorpion was there doc Hocker was there they had they had all of these bad guys there but they kind of resolve them and they just like they immediately knockouts court like scorpion gets knocked out with a hammer right and then Doc Ock I don't remember what they what happened that she's kind of you know what happened to her no good and they just get brushed aside and they do a bunch of stuff when a lot of things are happening but it's just like I wanna seem like Doc Ock was gonna have a subplot like she was gonna maybe betray kingpin yet again with her own mansion agents at Sur machine it's not just machine and that she was gonna do something like that but no that never you know never goes anywhere I really wish some of the second and third act jokes I was laughing at as I was looking at everybody else they're all laughing and having a good time it could have just been because it was like 9:00 in the morning that I was on laughing at every single joke you know like the anvil falling on the machine at the end people hahaha because this thing well the anvil was something there of the anvil I laughed when the anvil hits what's-his-face scorpion yeah cuz that's in a moment when you you got one over by Peter porker what happened he's just fun again that's what he does shyamalan he's amazing what happened he dropped an anvil basically just like a cartoon yeah so basically just Joe won't explain it to you they're in a fight and and he's like who are you what could you possibly do to me you're just a cartoon and cartoons are lame and stuff and he's like me got a problem with cartoons cartoons like they were pretty violent and Damned Kong who shed any dead [ __ ] amazing spider-man moves and then he busted out the [ __ ] mallet hammer and from his pocket and he said later on he gives it to miles he's like this will fit in your pocket and I believed him and then he drops a big [ __ ] ambulance 4 p.m. scorpion actually took that anvil pretty pretty well it was the hammer that knocked him out yeah so that was pretty funny and yeah just the use of colour the use of comic book panels the use of spray pain and creativity and artistry just I got to give it up to the director the writers and the you know everybody involved in that movie alright guys I think that's pretty much any other standing her haircut is because he got his fingers stuck on her on her hair and he's trying to hit on her and it didn't go so well the whole put your hand on the shoulder saying hey girl I'm gonna try that next state I go out on a girl I just come up yeah what else pretty good movie guys go out and see this one definitely are so we're gonna see bumblebee later on tonight Joe unfortunately has other plans you mean unfortunately I really want to have plans good ugly sweater thing or something like that so we'll have to miss out you're missing out Joe because me and Joe actually was like and Alex is totally not not feeling it but maybe we can convince you or maybe I will be horribly betrayed by the movie so okay so guys see you on the next angry Joe show bye bye see you guys oh don't forget subscribe click the like button and then
