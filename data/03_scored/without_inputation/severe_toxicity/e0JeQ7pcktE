film cooper plays an established singer-songwriter whose career is on the decline when he meets,0.03521815
Ally Lady Gaga he recognizes her talents immediately and decides to take a chance on,0.049936
her hi if you're new here my name is Shawn Chandler and I started this,0.07454181
channel cuz I was driving everyone around me crazy talking about movies way too much,0.072071984
if you can relate to that that you like to talk about movies more than,0.0072352025
the people around you you're probably in the right place and with that in mind,0.04152542
I'd love it if you tell me your thoughts on the movie down below in,0.14572045
the comments section are you excited for it have you already seen it did you,0.022960143
love it did you hate it all of that fun stuff let's have a nice,0.24232341
lively discussion with that said let's get started talking about the good probably the absolute,0.027601795
best thing about this movie for me is that it really does cover this full,0.029767632
spectrum of human emotions and life experiences like during the first 30 minutes of the,0.031828374
movie I was really surprised at just how funny it actually was and then it,0.02254773
becomes very romantic at times it's very tragic heavy dark at other points in time,0.0320858
in the film and then of course as it is a movie called a star,0.023466349
is born you have these moments of becoming as Lady Gaga's character is fully realized,0.025519105
and people discover it by the end of the film you feel like you've gone,0.026919981
on a very full emotional journey and been to so many different places that it,0.011748473
leaves you very satisfied and a large part of the reason that this movie works,0.04605931
is because of the performances everyone in this movie is just absolutely phenomenal and so,0.021222685
much of it boils down to just the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady gaga,0.069925435
you buy this strange interconnected relationship that's complex each of the characters are nuanced there's,0.020801622
things you love about them there's things you hate about them there's things where you,0.11941776
just want them so much to do something that they won't do and other times,0.04384558
they're doing things you wish they weren't doing and all of it makes for this,0.039426766
web of relationships the tie into careers that just keep you captivated from beginning to,0.021447517
end and all of them are absolutely convincing as all of this is taking place,0.088982284
Bradley Cooper has to be so many different things as this very broken character and,0.043896135
times you love him at times you hate him and you see him in so,0.2192452
many different lights and he just disappears the guy that you saw in The Hangover,0.06910593
is gone the guy from the a team isn't there this is this character brought,0.025459904
on to the screen likewise lady gaga plays a character that's taken on a huge,0.05434484
journey throughout the film and you would never guess she's a singer turned actress from,0.07802471
watching this film she did really in a new way a star an acting star,0.06205365
is born in her performance in this film in some ways yeah we knew that,0.019078797
Bradley Cooper was probably gonna be great on screen as an actor but we didn't,0.037174452
necessarily know is how great he was gonna be behind the scenes as the director,0.01823335
and he does a bunch of things great here as a storyteller first off he,0.058938596
does use a lot of visual techniques to draw our attention to just the right,0.017322047
details so he learned the information we need not by being told but by him,0.01816949
drawing us our attention to things by focusing in on things that help us to,0.029397791
understand what's happening in a visual way so we start putting the film together and,0.026647257
to that point part of what he does so well as a director is he's,0.02221514
always hinting at what's about to happen you don't necessarily know it as lines or,0.024406917
ceteris or eyes are drawn to something but he's always pointing toward us towards what's,0.059836596
about to happen and so lines of dialogue will happen and then two scenes later,0.066083334
as the events start to come together you get a sense of excitement you get,0.022008266
a sense of dread you get a sense of romance as you start to see,0.04423272
how it's fitting together and you're piecing it together in the good way you're able,0.0563803
to predict something that's about to happen not because the movies predictable but because he's,0.038482204
put all the pieces in place so you have that right sense of anticipation for,0.058496915
what's about to happen and as this is a musical you've got to talk about,0.02669648
the music itself and it is of course just phenomenal how much these songs both,0.014822952
tie into the themes of the movie itself and are just good songs that you,0.080000974
want to listen to once you leave the theater and like I said we didn't,0.033749424
know that Bradley Cooper could direct I didn't know that he could sing he's he,0.043290816
keeps up with Lady Gaga which is quite impressive I'd also highly recommend you check,0.033294436
this one out at a theater with a great sound system I got lucky in,0.0299326
the screening I was that might have the best Soundsystem in all of the Austin,0.07375024
area and I mean you felt like you were in a concert when they did,0.12166808
these concert sequences it's just how full and you could hear the crowd the separation,0.04654955
everything highly encourage you to check it out at a place with a great sound,0.024740841
system with that said let's move on to the mix aspects of the film and,0.008170451
the big thing that comes to mind really is just that the movie changes pretty,0.02940777
drastically as it goes along the first act or so maybe the first 40 minutes,0.04718813
of the movie moves it kind of one pace the stories to hold in one,0.017878806
fashion and as soon as things start to kick into action the way it's edited,0.20529562
the way scenes play out all of it changes and some of that factors into,0.022668129
the nature of the story itself what's going on with the characters and sort of,0.010350257
mirrors kind of the changes in their lives and things like that so it makes,0.043572854
sense it's not like it's executed poorly but it is a very big change so,0.058004014
if you love what's happening at the beginning you might be frustrated with what happens,0.033073597
as you move into the second and third acts of the film from there let's,0.029710427
move on to the negative aspects of the film and this is really a continuation,0.020406503
of what I just mentioned before but because the pacing changes so much in the,0.016312964
relationship dynamics change so much as you transition into the second act of the film,0.029289367
some of the storytelling momentum is lost a little bit some of the relational dynamics,0.035031896
are lost the chemistry isn't quite as strong because you're not sitting in them quite,0.03755627
as much as you were at the beginning you spend a lot of time in,0.025037512
individual scenes and sequences and then because things move so much quicker in the second,0.022835754
half of the film you're not sitting there as long where's the first act covers,0.053435534
a very small amount of time the rest of the film kind of montages through,0.02140162
big chunks of time and so there's a cost when you do things like that,0.03633832
before I get my final take on this movie be sure to tell me down,0.072033405
below in the comment section what did you think about it did you love it,0.03371084
- Jane have you seen it yet all that fun stuff I'd love to hear,0.024464125
take on this film as for me I'm gonna score this one in a and,0.08504639
a nine point five out of ten this was just this is classic great movie,0.024316452
