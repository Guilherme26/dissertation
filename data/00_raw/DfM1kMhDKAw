[Music] better late than never right I have finally got a Dunkirk review for you so I was really really looking forward to seeing this one but I haven't been able to catch it because of some travel assignments so as you might expect I've been hearing a lot about Dunkirk around the office and most of my colleagues keep focusing on the structure of the story the limited dialogue and the large ensemble of characters so normally I do like to walk into a movie with a completely open mind or at least as open as humanly possible but in this case one of the big questions I wanted to answer for myself at least was is this the best way to tell this story now I think I'm leaning towards a no on that right now but that doesn't mean I didn't like it in fact I really do admire Christopher Nolan's approach and I think it served the movie well in some respects but before I get too deep into my review a very brief synopsis for you the movie is based on the real Dunkirk evacuation during world war ii and it's divided into three parts so the mole is about a young soldier trying to get off the beach the sea follows a civilian boat going to rescue stranded soldiers and then third one is the air which features tom hardy as a fighter pilot first off the obvious here on the technical front Dunkirk is fantastic the visuals are stunning what it took to block all those extras is truly mind-blowing the sound design is incredible and the way Hans Zimmer score is woven in is also something else there are moments when it pairs perfectly with the gunfire or jet engines and then all of a sudden it'll be in stark contrast to all that and there are a number of moments when both approaches drastically enhanced certain beats of the story performances are also spot-on throughout you believe every single person every single second beyond Whitehead does a lot with very little dialogue as the main soldier featured in that first part the mole and Harry Styles proves he's actually a totally capable actually a really talented actor in that portion too Hardy is excellent in the air and so is Jack Loudoun who plays another pilot in that part and then with a seat three leaves really bring a lot to their characters you've got Mark Rylance our strong sense of common determination to him berry Kyojin is George a really young kid just trying to lend a hand and then tonglen Carney as Rylands his son who fits in right in the middle of the two of them and he really brings the group together especially when they start to navigate the situation with Killian burpies character really breaking it all down now maybe I should give the movie even more credit than I was planning to because every single segment is pretty moving and memorable and the ways they come together aren't really in a haha see what I did there kind of way the fact that they all connect actually feels organic and the way they come together also winds up enhancing the atmosphere no one visuals very clearly show you how dangerous the situation is then you got the score and sound design which make it even more intense but that nonlinear narrative format actually further highlights the chaos Dunkirk is missing the emotional beat of a traditional war film but in exchange for overwhelming atmosphere there's a real chaos to the movie that makes the evacuation truly truly frightening this isn't a scenario where the hero can save the day and then sail off into the sunset someone's survival is just a total crapshoot you could see it in one of the very first scenes when the beach is being bombed we're focused on one soldier on the ground and we see the bombs dropping all around him so it's one two three and then it stops right before he gets to him and it's so intense I'm giving Dunkirk four out of five duties on the Dewey Decimal scale you may not catch every single name or understand every single line of dialogue but Dunkirk will make sure that you remember how treacherous this incident was while also highlighting the difference just a little selflessness can make and that combination is pretty damn powerful so that's what I saw but I want to know what you thought did you see Dunkirk did you like it sound off in the comments section below and I'll see you real soon [Music] you [Music]
