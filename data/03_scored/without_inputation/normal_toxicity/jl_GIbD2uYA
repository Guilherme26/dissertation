I feel like the Hollywood thing going forward is gonna be alright,0.0490076
we're gonna take an actor,0.1003106
who's known generally for comedic things,0.13528347
so John Krasinski has stepped out of it since the office but he's more or less known for the office,0.113511644
we'll have them direct a thriller because apparently it really works a quiet place,0.14713407
so what quiet place is directed by John Krasinski he also gets writing credit on the movie along with a couple of other people and it more or less revolves around this family in this house in the middle of what looks like a farm and for a while now they have dealt with this situation the situation being is kind of a post-apocalyptic scenario you don't see much outside the farm,0.056967136
so you don't really know how the rest of the world is dealing with it,0.15016675
I can't glance at all the newspaper clippings I saw somewhat get the gist just being there are these aliens in the world really feral aliens,0.27208993
and if you make a sound they are drawn to sound if they hear you they will scamper over to you,0.31089434
and tear,0.09820263
you apart they'll shred you lose this family trying to sneak around going about their day-to-day not making sound those sounds probably will happen,0.3120953
and we've now set the stage for a very effective,0.047443017
thriller call,0.13039023
it a thriller,0.182075
I know some people like I don't like horror movies not as much a horror movie as it is a thriller a very fine line between thriller and horror movie,0.100800194
I feel like this movie really walks at well everyone in this movies great John Krasinski and Emily Blunt there's a scene in particular where I'm like emily Blunt's crushing it right,0.07321615
now I even have a couple of kids in the movie sometimes that is just your day away at that point not these kids these kids are great I'm kind of doing a flyby talking about oh they were all good in the movie but really they're great in the sense that one very huge part of communication is generally speaking gone in his movies everything they have to do they have to convey without words all the fear all the intensity any of the emotions their face their body,0.10611219
language,0.033744674
these are the tools because their voices just can't happen,0.15117608
they can't talk,0.09162008
they do they do sign language in the movie that's the primary form of communication,0.069303334
but let me just say that this is a thriller based on life and death in which the most intense of conversations are conveyed through sign language and it completely works,0.13361071
that's not very,0.08058233
conventional,0.03484689
they'll do a fantastic job operating in this world this movie has brought you into immediately,0.18870716
this movie brings you in on this world where you as the audience you feel like you can barely breathe,0.24359138
you definitely can't make any sounds there,0.12542383
were these people behind me,0.15119486
they were talking as the movie was starting,0.0927429
I was like oh my god a few times no immediately you get that feeling of,0.13112038
oh we can't make sounds and the theaters shut up even people who cough they were like oh my god nope you die not quiet enough,0.8671108
it's quite a thing when you can make the audience really feel like they're in the movie to the point where it's like making any sounds whatsoever,0.06966247
people are critical in their rappers to get their candy like and it doesn't so effectively because it illustrates how easy it is to make sound as homo sapiens are not stealthy the human race,0.2809631
we're loud we're clunky we're not quiet,0.41631573
that's why stealth is a skill that you have to faster I drop a little knickknacks and things all the time but if you do that in this world you die a big thing this movie illustrates it's how adaptable people are you will adapt to survive in most situations,0.2789446
and if you don't adapt good news you get to die early,0.6364068
so you can see how they get food you get to see their operations,0.102386534
it makes the world feel very lived in a movie like this or any apocalyptic type setting when it revolves around a family or a group of people and they don't really show how will they be survived,0.086775176
if I allow myself to pick it apart,0.083938174
I have to ask the question like how have you survived this long this movie shows how they've survived this long,0.100161865
it shows they do have a system doesn't mean this movie doesn't drag on in part,0.043205526
so for my first watch I was still glued I was like it shows the world I really this movie makes you reflect on human beings in general how much we rely on noise for communication for a release,0.10759732
I don't know how this movie got conjured up,0.13408463
but the fact that they're in a very intense scenario,0.05612855
I almost feel like someone was in a very intense scenario and they just had to release it had to scream they had to have a big cry and they thought what if you couldn't do that and that's what you really feel in this movie no one can cry,0.10525382
no,0.06626663
one can scream,0.08616833
no one can take a stick and smack a tree with it,0.53490317
so all the pain anger and emotions as families dealing with they haven't had a release that is straight up a version of hell,0.33385944
they're in hell and since they're feeling that this movie does a good job of bringing you into the movie you start feeling it every intense scenario,0.40324122
and there are a few of them you don't have release you don't go,0.10139806
you actually do the and you stop breathing this movie really preys on your fight-or-flight and you just freeze in place gotta hand it to a movie for doing that I mean when you first meet the family having all the noise go out when the cameras on the girl and having the ambient always come back when the cameras on the Sun it's genius and illustrating a couple things not only one of the things about one of the characters but also illustrating the contrast between quiet and sound does she realize how noisy the world is thus you realize how hard it is to be quiet cause,0.15140216
you realize the danger but I start to roll my eyes are moments where I'm like alright,0.11509068
I've seen this before in movies and it was just as cliche,0.068283595
there,0.016601479
well there'd be a particular scenario,0.063176766
I'm not gonna spoil anything,0.14969356
there's a scenario that takes longer than the 10 minutes it actually took and any time you have to bloody hand slapping onto the window,0.54398274
I'm like that is just that's just how many times does that happen,0.07289618
well chalk up one more because in the a quiet place was really unique my biggest flaw in the movie he's just simply where the movie ends,0.16965206
not that the movie ends,0.12174261
but where the movie ends where they decided to go,0.07015973
you know what that's the end end credits just didn't like it,0.078655586
gonna keep it vague but personally with me did not dig that choice,0.101944946
but in the end I thought John Krasinski crushed it every the movie did a great job,0.17080744
I was at the edge of my seat I was white knuckling it and I will say a quiet place is definitely worth watching and definitely worth buying on blu-ray,0.36111182
one of those movies you watch like I want my friends to watch this movie even if they just watch it once I want them to watch it once,0.18792619
