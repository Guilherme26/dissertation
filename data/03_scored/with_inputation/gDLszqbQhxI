a war fans welcome back to room 237 coming at you with another review of,0.24188189
1920s silent horror film this time I'm going back all the way to 1920 with,0.15113685
the cabinet of dr. Caligari which I'm holding this up because I don't own it,0.07686296
like many films back then as part of the public domain so you can find,0.072230555
it on YouTube which is how I watched it but I would love hold it,0.11254392
like an idiot but I would love to own this because I really enjoyed this,0.8785311
movie as far as silent films go I will put it up there with Nosferatu,0.17526038
it might actually be tied with a very different film it's very easy to see,0.0727332
the influence in it um I mean especially with people like Tim Burton or any,0.16157515
sort of visual filmmaker and the thing about dr. Caligari is it is widely considered,0.06057705
to be the first true horror film way back in 1920 course is debatable there's,0.11830964
been horror films before then mostly short films or trick films this was the first,0.1106623
one that I think was full-length and not a trick for my guess but yeah,0.05024791
so while it considered to be the first ever horror film so I have this,0.14102508
is a movie I want to see for a long time I've heard it mentioned,0.060546055
I've seen it referenced a bunch of times in movies for the longest time I,0.06444581
thought it was part of that 50 movie collection that I have I don't and,0.07881379
it's been kind of hard for me to find except for online but you know,0.16268787
I mean what can be said about it that hasn't already been said it is,0.05485971
a I mean saying its original would be kind of crazy because of how old,0.35739595
it is of course is nlgger original I would I will say that this movie,0.23749138
is a bigger our prime example of the German expressionist movement then say Nosferatu just,0.10621047
because of the visual style and Nosferatu feels mo even though it is German expressionist,0.10497047
it feels more straightforward then this does this is like witnessing someone's dream that's how,0.09886466
crazy and trippy this movie is I mean the whole movie literally looks like this,0.41489074
it looks like it is done on a stage like weird angles like the way,0.12658815
streets are depicted jagged lines windows are like triangles shadows from like lampposts or furniture,0.08827103
or trees is actually painted onto the set so you get this very artistic look,0.056434665
to the film which I find very fascinating and very in other senses you could,0.039866272
say it's cheesy and cheap but with this it really feels more artistic and more,0.1016532
more intriguing to look at see if I could just pull something up I should,0.04514334
have done this before but I didn't anyway and this the story is rather simple,0.052256033
it it is all it opens up with this young man named Francis played by,0.05889032
because I'm only familiar with one actor in this movie so I don't know anyone,0.096026234
else a frederick fair i believe is how you pronounce his name he plays this,0.1505492
guy at francis he's sitting on a bench with this older man and this woman,0.42724913
played by little dag / lil dag / that's right plays Jane and he says,0.095497414
oh that's my fiancee we've seen some crazy nlgger and he tells him the story,0.4711626
so he's probably the earliest unreliable narrator in horror and he tells a story about,0.11882397
how you know at some point in this past the carnival came to town and,0.05246179
this strange man came in and he had like an act with this um saamne,0.19275986
bolused I believe is how you pronounce it which is a sleepwalker played by conrad,0.15484467
veidt also from the man who laughs plays the sleepwalker named Caesar and dr. Caligari,0.11699857
is played by Werner crap werner krauss excuse me and basically the story is anyone,0.7411111
that sort of gives this doctor nlgger he pretty much hypnotizes or uses caesar to,0.31089434
commit to go out and kill them and the way it's done is it's beautifully,0.9156528
done I would say the score - this is better than nos bra to wear,0.22605117
nos bra to is more of like a gothic church organ even though I like,0.40324396
that this score seemed to fit a bit more and you know I had different,0.094719514
tempos and went with the film more and basically one of France's his friends named,0.06569026
Alan is murdered by Caesar so the more Francis looks into the murder you know,0.46630114
the more we find out about this dr. caligari in Caesar until eventually you know,0.06492774
and I mean it is a rather short film it's you know it's just over,0.14760244
an hour like an hour maybe 10 15 minutes the doctor sent Cesar after Jane,0.07519952
in her sleep what'd you get probably my favorite scene of the film which she's,0.11130397
in her bedroom and he he creeps up he wears like black leggings like a,0.27506158
black turtleneck and he has this weird like black diamond eye makeup everyone has weird,0.57905024
ass makeup in this movie especially dr. Caligari and just the way conrad veidt as,0.69542736
caesar like approaches her as she's sleeping with the knife and doesn't work he captures,0.450365
her but yeah I did mean to pull up just some stills of the sets,0.08380309
just so you can I mean this is this is like a walkway as he's,0.17302865
carrying Jane I mean jagged walkways and god damnit let me close or even like,0.8355208
streets which is clearly like a wooden or cardboard set with all these weird strange,0.16980672
lines one last one the the scene of him and Jane's bedroom possibly the best,0.092883974
personally my favorite scene in the film and also on YouTube I saw it in,0.040827733
the original print so you get some black and white you get like the gold,0.15550104
sepia tone you get like the blue that you see a lot but one I've,0.10672731
never seen before because even now a two is like sepia or blue when he's,0.13804409
in Jane's house other than her bedroom it's like this weird purple and it seems,0.27938744
like Jane's house and even Francis's house is that's like when everything looks normal like,0.054965757
the furniture is an all Tim Burton jagged looking and that's why some film historians,0.10620811
don't say it's a prime example of German expressionist because there's a little bit of,0.260007
scenes that aren't like I feel weird saying spoiler alert because this movie is 99,0.13375875
nlgger years old but there was a twist ending that I did not see coming,0.18763539
which is this dr. Caligari is he's a director of this insane asylum and he,0.6245014
was reading about you know couple hundred years ago there was this doctor Caligari that,0.06524442
used a saamne bolused to carry out acts of murder named Caesar so he became,0.31089434
obsessed and eventually a patient who was a song SS came in and he sort,0.18543933
of practiced on him named him Caesar and sort of became the new doctor Caligari,0.10469038
and so it's like it's told in flashback from Francis's point of view but then,0.052611433
we get to flashback to calc Ahri's past and then like when the authorities capture,0.114156
Caligari and put him away and we cut back to regular time you find out,0.18511096
the guy that Frances is talking to is another mental patient Jane is a mental,0.53490317
patient Caesars a mental patient and Frances is a mental patient and Caligari who now,0.3088583
does not have makeup is still a director of an asylum so it's like nothing,0.1794531
I'm sure there's different things you can take away from it but you know I,0.11067523
just the depths of madness that this movie is is insane I know another form,0.40322545
of German Expressionists or another big aspect of it is harsh Authority like sort of,0.31089434
interpreting harsh Authority you know like Caligari and being like a madman Caesar sort of,0.47366986
be in the German soldier sleepwalking and there was this one guy who wrote a,0.15300147
book called um Caligari to hit saying how this film is like a premonition of,0.10959071
Hitler some 13 years later at least but I definitely look at it as I,0.30870542
mean and even if this is the first horror movie ever which I consider it,0.18210125
to be it is still a damn behind film silent movies even though I love,0.53490317
old silent horror movies like family opera which I'll review at some point or not,0.1379456
fraught - which I have reviewed it it can be harder to watch because you,0.10641865
know people are overacting because silent films are you know in art form of body,0.1337471
language but this movie it the visual style the story the music even the title,0.055670686
cards I mean the title cards aren't just you know a black screen with text,0.2046162
I mean it's just weird fawn and some of them like when Caligari is Sanyo,0.15121837
at the carnival step right up ask Caesar your fortune at the bottom of the,0.15926394
title card there'll be like a shape like a cane sort of like how he's,0.071775675
getting everyone's attention or later on we're talking about murder at the bottom of the,0.2317224
tunnel of cars it's like a drawing of like a sharp object they really utilized,0.105775416
the title cards which even that I thought was very interesting you know like for,0.06102505
example the title cards are you know with we are backgrounds and shapes and fog,0.0623665
and again how every set doesn't there's no exterior shots it looks like a play,0.17353468
like it's all cardboard or particle board or something the fact that they paint shadows,0.08962335
with black paint like this movie really is like a nightmare or like a dream,0.20678003
it is the most surreal move well I mean you could also say Eraserhead is,0.18850434
the most surreal horror film but two totally different nlgger films it still it still,0.25938088
is very surreal and very dreamlike and of all the older horror movies that I've,0.15403429
been watching lately this might be one of my favorites and I would love to,0.06988628
own it I would love to you know especially find an Edition that has some,0.11914361
features because I would love to look into the making of this it was directed,0.10754022
by Robert Wayne wine German name but still just a simple story about a guy,0.07568362
telling his story about nlgger he's seen involving him and his fiancee about this crazy,0.53490317
doctor with a sleepwalker that kills people under his behest with twist after twist and,0.53490317
just the most surreal again sounds we were saying original about original set designs and,0.054237563
music and just the way people wear their makeup eaten that was another thing I,0.1886661
noticed during the main events of the film everyone has this weird makeup so you,0.15135303
know when you see Caligari up close he looks really creepy conrad veidt looks really,0.23972316
creepy but then in present time when we see where Francis is everyone looks normal,0.1600272
but very haunting images I love the set designs you know and again it's easy,0.07215759
to see the influence it's it's no surprise to me that next year this film,0.10423796
is gonna be a hundred years old and there's still people who are into it,0.059730053
amazed by it and talk about it I I wish I found this film earlier,0.097582504
I loved the cabinet of dr. Caligari it is the prime example of horror in,0.17468253
the 20s and I was amazed by you know the first ever horror film and,0.12923095
I thought it was that good even though I liked old horror movies anyway even,0.24187809
that old but I thought it was great I highly recommend it especially even if,0.08810877
you're not into silent films or necessarily old horror films in general if you are,0.16030176
definitely check it out but even if you're just into visually striking films that look,0.12707654
like nothing you've ever seen before definitely check it out so worth that I loved,0.19212826
it this movie I was blown away by it but that is 1920s the cabinet,0.106186986
