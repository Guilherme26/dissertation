hello,0.054463096
everyone my name is,0.031286377
Danny,0.029270217
this review is for the movie called portrait of a lady on fire,0.41705877
this is a 2019 film it is rated R it runs two hours and its stars probably not gonna saying these names right no Emmy Merle aunt Adele hen L Luana Boz Rami will give those a shot there you go the description of this is on an isolated island in Brittany,0.09484334
at the end of the 18th century a female painter is obliged to paint a wedding portrait of a young woman,0.15100248
this is portrait of a lady on fire,0.5154597
well I am doing a review of this movie but that doesn't exactly mean that I liked this movie or any movies like this,0.079260975
I am usually against watching movies with subtitles,0.1380071
I usually don't have the patience for it,0.099095516
I you know I can't just sit and watch two hours of reading a movie it's not what I watch movies for it's for entertainments for to be interested in something you know it's to be invested in an idea or watch a cartoon or watch an action scene or something,0.082872786
I don't watch movies to read subtitles,0.106331654
it's just not what I do,0.09593009
so when I sat down and I started reading this movie last week or last night,0.08111646
I'm sorry when I started into it,0.07503153
and I was reading the subtitles,0.05086688
I was like you know what I've been meaning to watch this movie for a while because it's been on my list,0.10137013
I know people have you know been suggesting it,0.05793881
I know what it's about it sounds interesting,0.06671473
now maybe there won't be so much talking because it's about a lady painting,0.15102318
and I thought maybe it'll be fine,0.06018917
so that's my overall opinion about this movie after watching it is that yes it has sometimes the whole time but there is a lot going on with the painting with interactions that you can kind of tell what's going on even if you weren't to watch the subtitles whatsoever,0.1338332
but honestly you know for future use of this video in this times of the virus I just kind of felt like toughing my way out through this movie because it has been on my list and I wanted to watch the whole thing - people say I've seen,0.11423902
it,0.046851434
and that's another reason why I decided to tough it out last night,0.09705838
- so as you get going in,0.09833826
this I don't know maybe other people are like me where they don't really like the subtitle movies as you go through,0.12376439
this it gets more interesting and you kind of know what's coming it's pretty,0.16446799
predictable and it's of an olden time and it's of a story one person's story in,0.08523885
history and it's a nice love,0.059067078
story I guess and it has some other things happen that are of intrigue and it has pretty dry,0.12808141
characters you know I mean they're,0.072609246
talking what French or I think there's a little bit of Italian than in this also but it's it's,0.12921506
fine it's a fine movie if this were made in English like I would have preferred it probably would be a little bit of you know maybe a high school movie where people are you,0.13573511
know they only have the summer to really enjoy,0.051038217
themselves and they just are meaning to talk to each,0.047038894
other but they are getting around to it in the last couple months that they have,0.06295008
available,0.034708448
so I mean it's a very generic movie in that sense that the reason why it was made was because of one person's experience in history,0.08627813
they had this person that they liked while they were doing a job,0.17637554
and then that's it you know that's that's the end of movie,0.08679926
so it's it,0.059224196
I don't know why we keep making movies like this,0.17039263
and why people think this is interesting,0.080930784
but you know I guess it's a kind of a life lesson,0.23770401
you know for people to stop waiting until the last second to tell somebody that they like them,0.12304445
it's at the reason why we keep getting movie after movie after movie of this idea where you know I don't know you know I Netflix and theatres alike get the same movie just in different forms,0.062126584
so portrait of a lady on fire,0.59576064
it has four main characters,0.067276195
and maybe a cast of thirty people you know not too bad not too big of a main necessary people that are around it's a little slow because it's only these three to four ladies in this house at a time there's some nice walks on the beach where in the ocean where it's very pretty scenery the painting by this lady that is the main character of the movie which is doing the painting,0.11244446
she has some nice artwork,0.11291527
she gives some nice lesson,0.19544546
she knows what she's doing she shows her expertise you know there's good interaction between her and the housemaid,0.16435832
that's nice you know to paint out kind of you know some human characteristics,0.14848441
they weren't just completely stuck-up they addressed the issue of being a woman versus a man,0.18723218
you know,0.07163658
there's there's some nice elements to it as far as that goes,0.06354346
it's not why I watch the movie but it kind of came out,0.09359009
so can I suggest it sure you know go ahead and go watch it a lot of people watch these subtitle movies a lot of people are interested in this kind of a movie with the painting,0.14919634
and the scenery and all this stuff and sure you know it's it's worth the watch if you're up for that and you have two hours to waste and you want to get involved,0.21849458
and you know this movie was out in theaters,0.103643715
somewhere,0.052030105
I think I might have seen it,0.050965905
at one of the smaller theaters while the while they were still open and everything but I just didn't have the urge to go see it in theatres for sure and I'm just kind of happy I saw I'm not really excited that I saw it or anything like that but I'm just glad I saw it,0.07136768
so it's out of the way I'm gonna get portrait of a lady on fire on see rating and I just can't get that excited about it for you you're gonna have to see yourself and kind of see what I mean that is kind of a bland movie it's kind of a bland story and reading some titles is no but no fun for anybody,0.25361112
so if there is a subtitle movie out there that I have to watch let me know maybe I can tough my way through it,0.0806463
if I can find it I'll give it a try,0.049088415
but this is probably one of the better ones that I have seen since I sat through the whole thing I enjoyed it,0.05090789
you know I'd say it was fine,0.110948235
so I think I could give a lot of subtitled movies a really low grade because I just don't care and I can't get invested in them and a lot of them I just stopped it after half an hour if I think it's completely boring after a half an hour,0.18308191
