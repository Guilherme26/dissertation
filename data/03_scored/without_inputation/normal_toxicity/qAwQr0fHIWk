by. Based on how much praise this movie was getting I was super anticipating this,0.09299996
"movie, but also cautiously making sure that the hype didn't get to my head. But",0.07198143
"thankfully this is just as good as everybody's been saying; this is a beautifully filmed,",0.054230217
well acted romance story and that says a lot from me because romance movies are...,0.041456006
my least favorite genre ever! I find them incredibly cliched and forced and really convenient,0.17689045
when it came to problems in a relationship and how they overcame obstacles. But what's,0.07398461
great about this movie is that it takes a long time to build up the,0.08158333
two of them as individuals before building up them as a couple. Marianne and Eloise,0.10099387
are two women who believe that it's best to be independent and try to control,0.18630387
"every aspect of their lives as much as they can. And oddly enough, that's the",0.12622628
reason they clash at first because one of them fights for what's theirs out loud,0.1721879
in public while the other one is nonetheless kind of content with accepting the fact,0.072777025
that there will be hardships in life. But after not only do they spend more,0.08203738
"time with each other but with this live-in maid named Sophie, the two of them",0.07608486
bond slowly over time and realized that they do kind of have to accept the,0.058037683
fact that people are not always gonna give you what they want especially in the,0.07992573
time period that they're in where there are just some things that they should have,0.05358782
control over but no one will let them have it. And as they spend more,0.06705103
"time together, they progressively switch roles to see who's more forgiving and accepting and who's",0.112136394
more cynical and that was the biggest surprise in regards to the romance side of,0.26982257
the movie. But the reason that it works so much as everyone has been saying,0.07391891
is the direction! Almost every shot really does look like a painting and the cinematographer,0.09730139
accomplishes this a lot by framing three or four different shots in one take and,0.08892103
they each adjust as actors move from one location to another. And it gives each,0.042697277
take a subtle amount of energy without giving you too much coverage but it also,0.07297444
allows the actors to play out their parts as uninterrupted as possible and because you're,0.20573886
"already so invested to what's happening on screen, the more time they're allowed to just",0.044115745
"play the part, the more time you just sit there wondering ""What's gonna happen next""?",0.062195756
And there's also- One of the biggest surprises was the fact that there's a real,0.053041425
lack of music and more of an emphasis on sound effects in order to create,0.108450726
atmosphere. There like three scenes that feature music and none of them come from a,0.10527584
"soundtrack, if there's any music it's because there's an instrument in the area and someone's",0.09283646
playing it. That's about it. But when another scene goes by where person is all,0.06446823
"alone, and you hear a fire playing in the background or hear echoing footsteps, it",0.11007517
just makes you feel completely alone and isolated just like the characters are. As much,0.056612752
"as the two women switching from who's the more forgiving and who's the more cynical,",0.56819534
"there is one argument that kind of feels a little out of left field, mostly",0.07381131
because that character had never really lashed out at anyone before and the other one,0.11661113
"had, so that was really the only confusing aspect and they don't really-out of all",0.056523554
"the scenes that do take time, that was the one that felt maybe the most",0.062668025
"rushed, but... It's literally only one scene, it lasts a couple minutes flat and... Other",0.08422942
"than that, I really don't have a problem with this movie; the direction, the cinematography,",0.063510545
the performances all of it is outstanding. If you can find an arthouse theatre that,0.061182037
