hi guys I'm Maria and welcome back to Santa club today I'm going to be,0.03832788
reviewing the new Pixar movie for you which is inside out I have been waiting,0.10131811
for this movie to come out for a very long time we have talked about,0.054247722
it multiple times in our movie podcast now conspiring and we've been very excited about,0.060463198
it and it's finally here and I got to see it last night I don't,0.05859137
want to give away too much of the plot because i feel like if you,0.14700824
say too much it gives away the magic and i feel also like the creators,0.06110111
have done a really good job and not saying too much about what happens that,0.020290762
really keeps the interest in mystery alive and I feel like that's how you should,0.03377736
go into this movie not know you so much about it except that it's about,0.054567676
the voices inside your head how they work and you know how you react when,0.074463315
things change in your life I have to say the first half of the movie,0.073105015
really blew me away they do such a great job and explain to you how,0.12307228
it slowly develops the first emotion that comes into Riley's life immediately after she's born,0.090605326
is happiness which goes to show that humans are innately happy from the very beginning,0.05251292
and then right after about half a minute later comes sadness and that's where babies,0.09994451
cry and they feel uncomfortable and it's really fun to see these five emotions slowly,0.03658244
come together and work as a team to create great memories for Riley five main,0.021802058
emotions are joy sadness disgust anger and fear and they're all so much fun of,0.14186105
course they're mainly one-dimensional because they're supposed to represent one particular voice of one particular,0.01488415
emotion so right from the beginning i'm not expecting full development from each of these,0.03473589
characters because together they are one great fully developed character which is riley they just,0.014924061
give you such a colorful and you know creative yet so accurate world of how,0.02961331
your mind works so all your character traits are built in link different islands and,0.055196274
you have this huge huge sort of area which is your long term memory which,0.039697494
is really fun as well and you get to see things like abstract thought know,0.025501145
the train of thoughts imaginary land which was probably everybody's favorite so it's a fun,0.021408271
adventure it's a fun ride throughout the mind of somebody and it's super compelling it,0.056245267
keeps you really interested but I feel like after you to know the world pretty,0.04054294
well the movie kind of just like slowly decreases in interest and in the element,0.04191788
of surprise I really had a hard time figuring out what it is that I,0.049921367
didn't like about the movie when you watch a Pixar movie or at least the,0.024842614
ones that I really love there's just something about them that just really blows you,0.21814698
away and it's not to say that this movie is not incredible that I just,0.042585723
didn't get the same feeling one of the things that really started to put me,0.010946928
off the movies that we focus a lot of what's going on inside the mine,0.06632147
which is kind of so to speak a technical issue which is now affecting Riley's,0.021071687
emotions something goes wrong I can't really explain it without giving too much away and,0.03078869
Riley's reacting to it because you know that's what's happening in her mind and I,0.0382893
first I thought that was great because that's exactly what you go through in this,0.02578784
period of time in your life and confused you get angry you're kind of like,0.11178278
talking back to your parents so you're not joyful all the time but then it,0.13987017
quickly becomes like we don't know what we're doing in the system so Riley is,0.016526489
reacting kind of like a robot that's the part that I mainly didn't like I,0.025400037
understand moments where she should be angry and anger is taking control of the whole,0.057990044
situation but there are moments where it just doesn't make sense and it does feel,0.01220479
like she's just a robot reacting to the buttons these guys are pushing in her,0.04441498
mind there's a moment where she sees this rail and she's super pumped to just,0.06035544
slide down it but then all of a sudden she's not she gets kind of,0.09260487
sad and then all of a sudden she's like whoo yeah let's do it one,0.109035574
more time those are the kind of things that overall don't make sense and don't,0.027191376
feel organic to the process of someone's emotions she doesn't feel like full-fledged character she,0.039204594
feels just a little strange in these reactions I really wish there would have been,0.019276356
a bigger balance between what's going on outside of reminder what's going inside I don't,0.014489695
feel like there's a lot happening outside for these reactions to have merit sure she's,0.021727558
going through a tough time yes there has been changed but I was expecting more,0.02577387
things to happen in her daily life that would marry these sort of strange reactions,0.077598326
inside of her head that was kind of a downer because Riley is a really,0.18927401
cool character and I really wanted to see more from her and I really enjoy,0.02294418
the moments where you see her but you still hear all the voices for example,0.019434005
she goes into room and there's like all these things like Oh what if this,0.05591068
happens which is fear and disgust is going like nope this is not going to,0.12830195
work enjoys trying to be very positive about everything and thought that was great because,0.056819323
that's exactly how your mind works you have all these different thoughts about a same,0.028874956
circumstance I really enjoyed those moments and I really enjoyed the animation I mean I,0.04298816
think that goes without saying there are times were you seen Riley crying and her,0.066578895
expressions are just so accurate and so beautifully done she flushes around her nose and,0.12933898
her cheeks when she cries I thought it was fantastic not to mention that the,0.24725609
characters inside her head are just so unique and vibrant and colorful there's a little,0.08945057
detail that I loved that I kind of only noticed enjoy I didn't know if,0.039172
I noticed it and the other ones joy skin like the outline is not as,0.14965369
defined as the human beings in the movie I can't explain it i don't want,0.11595947
to say pixelated because it's not that but there is sort of like a softness,0.059749454
in a bit of a you know sprinkly kind of look to her skin and,0.1567931
she's glowy and I'd kind of like that because i feel like it resembles that,0.08673064
she's a bit abstract she's inside her mind she's not a concrete beam there's many,0.2986075
details like that throughout the movie that make it amazing and of course you noticed,0.028443253
that it's Pixar and it's their amazing attention to detail and their original characters that,0.015823388
just makes it so fantastic I let the theatre is really liking the movie thinking,0.09552702
that it's really great not one of their best though but that's just my opinion,0.029488921
I know people are just raving about it and they're so enamored with this world,0.11624483
that they have created they feel like it's so original maybe it's just my standard,0.026492935
reaction to the overhead two reactions of the media that makes it feel kind of,0.01961161
uneven but I just don't think it's as incredible as people are saying it is,0.030378938
I think you quickly start noticing that it's really the same formula Pixar has been,0.03705472
using for quite a while it's a great formula but you start noticing that it's,0.034256957
just something you've seen before you have the story that starts out really peachy everything,0.0551557
is perfect but then something happens and these characters need to go back to a,0.04384824
place where they belong like toy story like finding Nemo and then there's the whole,0.04775686
dynamic of the two main characters that don't really like they're kind of opposite in,0.036507938
so many ways like finding Nemo up Toy Story and at one point something happens,0.03931102
the characters get upset one of them ditched the other like a finding nemo a,0.03331639
toy story but then their room night did they realize they're better when they're together,0.04400456
they're really good friends do timing doesn't it sound familiar again it's not to say,0.018534677
that the movies not good it's just that the publicity and the reactions have been,0.016231146
so high up and so exaggerated when you finally go see the movie the expectations,0.048598982
are like all out of whack overall it's a great movie it's really fun it,0.3694235
gets emotional at certain places which is to be expected I didn't point it as,0.015033816
emotional as other Pixar movies but there's a few moments where you're like okay you,0.04765442
got me pics are I'm crying in the theater thanks so that's if I had,0.06411373
to rate this movie for you I would tell you that inside out is worth,0.15570553
seen in theaters so nice tell me did you like inside I was it everything,0.054738626
