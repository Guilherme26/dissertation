hello everybody and welcome back to my channel if you're new here hi i'm mia,0.039221223
tiffany and today we are going to be watching the highly recommended highly anticipated film,0.03564985
casablanca and y'all i am so excited to watch this film okay so casablanca was,0.19835511
released in 1942 directed by michael curtis starring humphrey bogart as rick blaine ingrid bergman,0.07448128
as ilsa lund and paul henried as victor laszlo with other notable performances by claude,0.07709545
raines who we saw actually in mr smith goes to washington sydney greenstreet who we,0.035552736
saw in christmas in connecticut and s z caskel who we've also seen in christmas,0.11170828
in connecticut so i'm excited to see all of them in this film so before,0.25826788
we get into a little bit more of the film background i kind of wanted,0.029697124
to add in some historical background because there was a lot going on around this,0.026031297
film so if you want to stay and listen to the historical background please do,0.028841032
so or if you want to skip right on to the film reaction you can,0.014447789
do that too but without further ado let us get into some historical background okay,0.11092004
so during the time of the film's release the world was at war and because,0.041196153
of that hollywood kind of shifted into more moral boosting and patriotic themes and as,0.036120135
we know casablanca is no stranger to these themes in fact it was originally supposed,0.04861628
to come out in 1943 however they pushed it to 1942 in order to align,0.10645599
it with the allied forces successful invasion of north africa now this invasion uh served,0.1426227
as the first step in sort of weakening the axis powers hold on southern europe,0.058413766
and then in the very next year in january of 1943 the city of casablanca,0.05429362
served as the location for the casablanca conference which was attended by fdr and winston,0.024599157
churchill so not only did all of these events increase the popularity of the film,0.057115994
also show the us's support for the allied forces i also wanted to take a,0.027809998
moment to shout out grouchy marks for adding some of this information in the comments,0.05715258
thank you so much also i really appreciated and loved your story about how your,0.03093636
grandparents went to go see this film and all of the excitement in the movies,0.04202963
so thank you again grouchy marks for sharing that with all of us okay so,0.07415866
a quick synopsis of this film it says a cynical expatriate american cafe owner struggles,0.09235809
to decide whether or not to help his former lover and her fugitive husband escape,0.046075277
the nazis in french morocco some interesting things that i found about this film so,0.2592071
first of all this film was actually based off of an unproduced play called everybody,0.053669013
comes to ricks written by murray burnett and joan allison now they actually ended up,0.1074837
selling the rights to warner bros for 20 000 which at the time was actually,0.03274034
a record-breaking sum everybody who worked on this film did not anticipate the success that,0.02535547
it would have it actually became the fourth highest grossing film in 1943 taking home,0.062881805
a whopping 10 million 462 500 in the domestic box office it also was nominated,0.054947495
for eight oscars three of which it won for writing directing and then the big,0.02339983
ticket one which is outstanding motion picture yeah so this film is very popular and,0.016887682
had a lot of success and i'm so so so excited and so glad to,0.035175577
be sharing this moment of my first time watching this with all of you i,0.085276544
cannot wait to watch this film but before we do y'all already know the deal,0.038791515
if you haven't already please subscribe to my channel and hit that bell notification to,0.122677825
stay in the loop alright everyone it is time the moment we've all been waiting,0.014302779
for please get your drinks and your snacks and let us get in to casablanca,0.19859324
[Applause] also by the way i have all fruits i have bananas and oranges because,0.041550033
i am trying to be healthy but i wish i had ice cream to all,0.093695775
officers two german couriers carrying important official documents murdered and trained from iran murderer and,0.2854677
possible accomplices headed for casablanca okay i just want to explain really quick so in,0.08919248
the beginning they were saying that um to in order to escape the nazis reign,0.22224717
in europe a lot of refugees traveled from paris down to casablanca and they're waiting,0.043248244
to be able to go to lisbon and then to the new world which i'm,0.058780283
assuming is america so i just wanted to explain that because i feel like that,0.026630627
might have gotten a little lost it might get lost in the editing too so,0.023137748
everyone is trying to leave casablanca to go to lisbon to go to america perhaps,0.06428601
tomorrow will be on the plane i kind of i feel for these people because,0.026695816
they're essentially just sitting ducks you know waiting to be able to have enough money,0.14726235
to go to to basically run to freedom like i just think about the time,0.078572825
that they lived in and how much like stress and uproar and fear that was,0.028362101
probably circulating around during the war it's just really it's surreal like you don't think,0.0996771
about it when you're comfortable in in 2021 just thinking about what happened in the,0.034028135
past but i just imagine what it must have been like for real people who,0.031896885
were trying to escape to freedom like that must have been really hard there's claude,0.032819495
rain unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca thank you captain it's very good to be,0.12621461
here majestrous are my aide lieutenant cassell so the actor who plays major heinrich strausser,0.14807121
he was actually born in berlin and he was publicly known to be anti-nazi but,0.27487856
the only way that he was going to play this role of heinrich strausser is,0.031250995
if the as if the character was quote a villain with no redeeming qualities like,0.032470938
he wanted to make sure that this character didn't have any sort of goodness in,0.026031962
him i guess which i thought was really interesting like that was his only um,0.047624487
his only like i'll only play the role if xyz thank you thank you and,0.028768528
bring the 15 000 franks in cash remember in cash gosh everyone is really trying,0.020661935
to to get out i think they also suspect that or they they feel like,0.050845306
it's only a matter of time because at the time again the nazis were were,0.2502
storming all these different countries so i i wonder if they thought that it's only,0.24755505
a matter of time before the nazis come to casablanca so i think that's why,0.26839948
everyone just wants to get out as quickly as possible oh humphrey bogart i love,0.19215226
humphrey bogart and i say that honestly that he was actually the first male um,0.18572061
love interest that i saw in the classic film the first classic film that i,0.04546464
ever watched was sabrina with audrey hepburn and humphrey bogart and that began my love,0.09508601
affair with classic films i absolutely love humphrey bogart letters of transit so are those,0.07757971
are those the transit papers that the two germans had did he must have gotten,0.066233
a hold of them oh my goodness so that makes him like a poi what,0.09826093
else i'm noticing about this film is there's a lot more motion in the camera,0.04203229
i can see that there's a lot more movement in the camera and the cinematography,0.042561777
is is moving and and moving through rick's cafe and i also wonder if that's,0.014077947
because of citizen king because i do remember reading that a lot of cinematography after,0.018971037
that film was really inspired by that film again i i read it somewhere i,0.026798254
i don't know if i'm 100 true so if i'm wrong please correct me but,0.044635154
yeah i'm just noticing there's a lot more movement with the camera and a lot,0.046771057
more pannings and and moving around as if you know we're kind of walking around,0.07011102
with the characters and i really loved seeing that because usually the camera is very,0.015372394
stationary so it kind of has more of a modern feel to it which i,0.049236894
really appreciate who's got nothing we got nothing how much i don't know why like,0.046324056
i don't know why i get so excited to see actors that i've seen in,0.06709308
previous films that we've watched on this channel because it's like duh actors they're in,0.047520053
multiple projects it's like seeing tom cruise and you know just another film but for,0.027426187
some reason for me it's like oh my gosh like i know i know sydney,0.1370531
greenstreet or i know claude rains like i've seen his work before and it's just,0.03731148
so exciting to be able to say that i know their work but then also,0.019972805
to see them you know in different characters in these old films i i don't,0.105301894
know i just get super excited if you guys have do you guys get excited,0.23723626
like that i don't know let me know in the comment box if you do,0.035786215
now i'm officially putting that song in my spotify playlist that was a lot of,0.045977492
fun yeah but i was stuck because he won i love you oh shut up,0.335259
so the actress that plays yvonne actually outlived all of the other cast members i,0.041162893
don't believe she died until 2016. she died in 2016. yeah that is what a,0.09517847
life but how cool would it have been to to tell people oh yeah i,0.034471147
was actually a cast member in casablanca like that would be so cool i don't,0.15865494
know who were you last night that's so long ago i don't remember will i,0.05209918
see you tonight i never make plans that far ahead i really love how humphrey,0.23143642
bogart is playing into his cynicism it you really feel it from his character and,0.16431898
for some reason i just feel like it it i don't know it just makes,0.045279715
his character more which he's supposed to be cynical but the way that he's playing,0.04571275
it it's like it's so believable like he's he's a really good actor really good,0.16168885
actor you would like to be on it every single time there's a plane that,0.053886525
goes through or a plane that takes off it's very consistent the way that everybody,0.032249432
reacts to it you can tell that they're all just they're just wishing that they,0.04344647
were on that plane but more so it's almost as if it's like a symbol,0.042629626
of freedom which makes more sense because flying when you think of flying anything freedom,0.046891455
but i just love the consistency of of how everyone reacts to a plane taking,0.030470068
off it's just goes to show how much care was taken into this screenplay absolutely,0.04965862
there is a man arrived in casablanca on his way to america he will offer,0.09441484
a fortune to anyone who'll furnish him with an exit visa what's his name victor,0.12661572
laszlo no matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or i,0.19377266
should say too why too he's traveling with a lady how convenient that there were,0.044808768
two german couriers who were murdered for their exit visas and now there are two,0.3745264
people who need said exit visas to escape the nazis i mean it most likely,0.22005074
was done intentionally are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans and,0.13133653
their beloved paris not particularly my beloved paris can you imagine us in london when,0.057924192
you get there ask me so watching this i feel like i don't know i,0.041372426
didn't i didn't read this anymore but this is just a hunch have you guys,0.100193284
ever seen quentin tarantino's and glorious bastards well this scene reminds me of the scene,0.56464607
when they're like in the pub or like in the the bar and there's like,0.10149705
tensions are heightened because michael fassbender's character is like a you know he's like a,0.051501844
double agent they're all sitting around the table it really reminds me of this scene,0.0795114
so i don't know if this scene was influenced or that scene was influenced by,0.04225446
this scene or if it was just kind of a coincidence which i don't feel,0.08361957
like there are coincidences in in hollywood but i don't know it just it really,0.035624575
reminds me of that scene oh and if you guys know if quentin tarantino really,0.05180583
did get inspiration from this scene please let me know in the comment box i,0.03098625
would love to know that piece of information how about new york well there are,0.037262924
certain sections of new york major that i wouldn't advise you to try to invade,0.109030254
uh-huh who do you think will win the war with the slightest idea i really,0.13589635
appreciated that when he asked him who do you think will win the war and,0.04080702
he's like i haven't the slightest idea that he didn't push well it first of,0.044146243
all it's not even in his character to push which side would win but i,0.06269755
appreciate that they didn't make that into uh oh we think americans are gonna win,0.09684342
or we think the germans are gonna win like they made it very neutral which,0.12104414
obviously fit for bogart's character but i think that that that just had a little,0.031529706
bit more of a innuendo in there like at the time they didn't know who,0.06511616
was going to win the war and there was a lot of fear that was,0.051843747
like circled around who's going to win and what's gonna happen afterward but i appreciate,0.089477845
that they left that ambiguous because i feel like if they were to push it,0.0625991
you know into the more patriotic side and say the americans are you know like,0.090318635
the allied forces are gonna win then i feel like it would have been a,0.024208028
little bit too um like it wouldn't have it wouldn't have been realistic just obviously,0.06511816
for the time that it came out i'm just really happy that they left that,0.042150028
ambiguous so that it's not you know giving people false hope if the allied forces,0.0960911
didn't win oh so that's victor laszlo thank you but i hardly think then perhaps,0.032149658
for the lady the ring is quite unique oh yes i'm very interested i love,0.027812658
the spy elements of this movie too like there is a lot of like it,0.055354588
almost feels like i don't know if that's right like espionage i don't know if,0.028862318
that's the right word but there's a lot of like spy elements in this film,0.043517645
that the two german couriers for the transit papers got in play as time goes,0.027895141
by sing it sam you must remember this a kiss is just a key wow,0.06831436
what a beautiful the music in this movie kudos to max steiner i i don't,0.021317141
believe he's alive anymore but kudos to him for for using this music and he's,0.0695536
like why are you playing this song bro did you see that longing stare i,0.060670733
want to know the history there of all the gin joints and all the towns,0.08005884
in all the world she walks into mine so under all that cynicism and under,0.28977016
all that that he puts up there really truly is a sentimental man i mean,0.052351948
you can see it and the way he's acting like the way that he is,0.022628218
almost longing for her like dang i love flashbacks so they had a love of,0.09194767
a love affair and penalty we said no questions is looking at you kid oh,0.11820513
it's like the line well one of the lines but still why there is no,0.021146188
other man in my life that's easy that was he's dead i'm sorry for asking,0.34284404
nothing kills a beautiful love story like war wednesday thursday at the latest they'll be,0.20542069
in paris they'll find out your record it won't be safe for you here i'm,0.029975835
on a blacklist already i will say it is interesting to hear other accents like,0.076367736
we on this channel we've heard the british accent in the 1930s but ingrid bergman,0.11818052
is from sweden and so to hear her accent on top of the like the,0.019491876
1930s way that they used to talk is very interesting because it sounds very different,0.020751733
than what a swedish accent sounds like now this sort of takes a sting out,0.19483429
of being occupied does it mr richard you said it he's looking at you kid,0.07175402
i didn't know he said it multiple times in the movie i thought it was,0.023581425
just honestly i thought it was just that one time at the end like that,0.024927758
one scene that they always show where they're like in the rain but i guess,0.022259705
he says it multiple times i love that though or is it my heart pounding,0.09303724
so this may ruin some parts of this movie for you and i apologize in,0.22781621
advance so ingrid bergman was two or three inches taller than humphrey bogart which means,0.13757129
that whenever they whenever they did scenes together they had humphrey either stand on the,0.071261786
platform or they tied like boxes like platforms to his shoes to make him seem,0.026842821
taller than ingrid and then ingrid would would be acting barefoot and so that i,0.27149048
just think it's funny because during the romantic scenes you want to be like oh,0.039239183
it's so romantic and then you think to yourself but he's standing on a platform,0.07235469
at that point no no no no we must leave yes of course we the,0.022549061
train for my saili's at five o'clock i'll pick you up at your hotel at,0.10537906
4 30. christmas if it were the last time so another random piece of movie,0.028663429
fact so this scene well this flashback scene was one of the first scenes that,0.04864754
they shot in the production schedule and humphrey bogart was like he's like i don't,0.22514376
want to shoot these scenes because i'm not like all about that romance life or,0.6470445
something like that he said something like that and michael curtis was like you know,0.05719648
what we just got to get it we got to get it grab it and,0.026453024
we'll move on to the other stuff so i just thought that was interesting a,0.022784535
little interesting fun fact to note yeah but now everyone is fleeing from paris gosh,0.027812658
the just i could just imagine like the chaos and the pandemonium but then also,0.04718946
there's that aspect of like there's a sadness like you're leaving some people had to,0.029282048
leave you know their homes and the place where they grew up for a land,0.05775058
that they a foreign land to them so it's just like i said i think,0.05057125
in the last in the last video these films really give you insight into kind,0.14207391
of how life was lived during the time and there's just there's a there's a,0.029145021
sadness that i feel for these people that were uprooted out of their lives because,0.05762885
of this war like it's it's just it's really sad it says richard i cannot,0.048807185
go with you or ever see you again you must not ask why just believe,0.03330641
that i love you go my darling and god bless you ilsa oh so she,0.07457041
left him she was acting real shady in the last scene and that's what broke,0.07766884
his heart i wonder if that's where his cynicism comes from because he doesn't seem,0.16028798
very cynical in this flashback he seems like a sentimentalist so this must have made,0.17339209
him cynical and there she is oh no this spells trouble oh god i feel,0.19935088
bad for both of them it kind of has elements of brief encounter where they,0.055654585
weren't trying to fall in love they were just two people who happened to meet,0.07434558
in paris who fell in love and yeah and that sucks sometimes life just sucks,0.64451134
can i tell you a story it's about a girl who had just come to,0.06525851
paris from her home in oslo she met a man about whom she had heard,0.055523545
her whole life everything she knew or whatever became was because of him but the,0.06115898
feeling she supposed was love she's not talking about rick i think she's talking about,0.12961635
victor when she was talking about meeting a man after coming from oslo oh tell,0.03906158
me who was it you left me for was it laszlo or were there others,0.082606494
in between aren't you the kind to tell wow he's just talking out of anger,0.0943849
and and pain don't let it get to you or you may leave for lisbon,0.061586026
tomorrow on one condition you know the leader of the underground movement in paris in,0.03256606
prague you'll furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your,0.19256268
visa in the morning laszlo is literally telling this this um heinrich that like yeah,0.06537225
i'm i'm the leader of the like he they all know that he's a leader,0.046006095
of the resistance and but there's no like guns being drawn there's no you know,0.045130715
no violent things happening and it's just interesting to see the production code and and,0.05197346
the role that it plays in this in the storytelling because i feel like if,0.01899565
this was a film that were to come out in 2021 or you know in,0.05813572
the 2000s there would be a lot more violence there'd be a lot more like,0.12528734
struggle because like i said i was watching and i'm like why isn't why isn't,0.016674824
heinrich like doing anything like physically like why isn't he like you know like shooting,0.3211499
guns or like you know holding him down or restraining him or or on the,0.10958368
flip side like why why does everyone know the um laszlo secret like wouldn't that,0.034231015
be more secretive but no and i i suspect it's because of the production code,0.034473144
so it's just interesting to see its influence did you run out on me because,0.064683124
you couldn't take it because you knew what it would be like hiding from the,0.023558808
police running away all the time no you say victor lasler is my husband and,0.22487117
was even when i knew you in paris oh oh my god so she was,0.034896865
married when they were in love in paris what also doesn't that violate the haze,0.087406464
code because oh i guess it doesn't because she because she thought that her husband,0.06998064
was dead have you heard about senior gotti in the letters of transit yes something,0.048841108
those letters were not found in a guardian when they arrested him you know where,0.044917192
they are not for sure i'll venture to guess that a god he left those,0.077962846
letters with messier oh so now they know that rick has the papers oh that's,0.03581016
lovely god i love the boldness of lazlo he's so bold and i absolutely love,0.11326215
him i love his character i really love him and everyone stands out to sing,0.038053825
the french the french national anthem i have goosebumps that's awesome more than anything now,0.15715297
i need rick to give him the transit papers yes but no intention of selling,0.014665969
them when i was in a concentration camp where you lonely in paris he knows,0.106825836
he has to know why would he ask that and she's there how did she,0.03393767
get in there all right oh she has a gun pointed at him no i,0.21231797
want those letters go ahead and shoot he'll be doing me a favor she's not,0.62453955
gonna shoot you she loves you their their romance and their chemistry is very you,0.6663989
can you can tell that there's a lot of chemistry between their characters but i,0.02186126
also read that behind the scenes they weren't as romantic with each other but it's,0.066949405
just it's interesting because their chemistry is so good i knew it it's romantic so,0.02620757
that scene was only allowed because of an editing difference because of the dissolve that,0.045426056
