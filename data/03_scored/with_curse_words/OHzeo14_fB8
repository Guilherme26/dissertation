like is our first of all I mentioned the actors the two leading men the,0.080021165
cast was really great and includes four Oscar winners Robert DeNiro Al Pacino Joe Pesci,0.05846698
and Anna Paquin I really like Anna and I was expecting to see more of,0.06516705
her she I think has one line in the entire movie and she mostly just,0.13271762
kind of looks and stares so that seemed like a waste of talent for her,0.4648465
but anyway it was still nice to see her in the movie and the other,0.13859299
three that I just mentioned phenomenal and I hadn't seen Joe Pesci in anything in,0.07058433
quite a while so I just loved to seeing him other standouts are Bobby Cannavale,0.28732955
E Steven Van Sant Harvey Keitel Ray Romano Jesse Plemons and a million more Italians,0.106404625
in Hollywood rumor has it that Joe Pesci actually refused this role more than 50,0.07709485
times because he didn't want to come out of retirement but I'm so glad he,0.0657044
did he is just outstanding I already said that Ray Liotta however is missing in,0.065774426
the movie I don't know if he got an invitation or not but he should,0.1546455
have been I really liked him and he would have been perfect in this movie,0.10661505
it was also really fascinating to learn about some of the real-life people and how,0.24282265
everything was connected and how things might have gone down of course we still don't,0.06378625
know the facts of everything so it was just an interesting perspective and it could,0.031147424
have easily happened this way I'm always in summary impressed with the technology that makes,0.030340917
actors look younger so the special effects were just amazing they were provided by Industrial,0.08101767
Light and Magic and that was half the fun was watching some of these older,0.092193924
actors go back in time they're actually Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro actually speak,0.15396455
Italian in the movie with no subtitles or at least than the one that I,0.13077283
saw there were no subtitles they talked about the war and then they quickly transition,0.09751931
to English but the Italian sounded pretty good and gave a really nice authentic flare,0.105761744
I thought it was super interesting to read on the screen how various people in,0.07168632
the Mafia were found dead not at the very end of the movie although there's,0.3339121
a little bit of that but during the movie as new characters are introduced it'll,0.049994
say on the screen found shot dead 14 times in the head or the heart,0.62065256
or whatever and I was just like whoa so that was kind of a really,0.10023279
interesting and actually kind of a cool element that I really liked it the music,0.052223027
was perfect set the tone although there was one song that they played over and,0.04570548
over again whatever now some things that I didn't like and this list is very,0.054530587
short first of all the movie is really really long too long I think some,0.11614716
things could have easily been cut out some people say oh not a minute was,0.15171374
wasted it was perfection and actually there was some talk that they were going to,0.08401663
turn this into a two-part series which I think would have been good or better,0.071977414
for the average viewer it's just really really long this is actually the longest film,0.08096865
ever directed by Martin Scorsese and the longest feature film released in over 20 years,0.025312964
it took 106 days to film also the longest shooting of Scorsese Scorsese's career and,0.10921845
so another item was that there's some jumping back back and forth quite a bit,0.09304843
from past a present that might confuse viewers and then the only other pro are,0.06005299
the only other thing that I didn't care for was just so much profanity for,0.11482012
me it's just exhausting to sit through all of that I want to see the,0.12777545
art and of course it represents how they they would have spoken back then but,0.063252226
it's just exhausting anyway that's it I thought it was really really well done I,0.06860929
