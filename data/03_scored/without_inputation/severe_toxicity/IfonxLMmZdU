hello this is a Hitchcock review and heads-up there will be spoilers in the last,0.11562422
couple minutes of the video I will give you fair warning when I get to,0.13366133
that point today I am talking about Rebecca Alfred Hitchcock's 1940 adaptation of the 1938,0.02852108
novel by Daphne du Maurier running 130 minutes stirring Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier this,0.027065657
was Hitchcock's first american film and the only one of his films to win the,0.043273523
Academy Award for Best Picture it also won for best black-and-white cinematography Rebecca tells the,0.002720434
story of a shy awkward English girl working as a paid companion who meets and,0.19787085
falls in love with mysterious Maxim de Winter a wealthy Englishman still recovering from the,0.08374462
death of his first wife a year ago after a whirlwind romance they marry and,0.4005369
he brings her home to Manderley Manderley sounds better when pronounced with an English accent,0.08073533
as Mandalay his sprawling country estate where she finds herself constantly reminded of the woman,0.096683115
she's replaced Rebecca whose memory lingers around every corner it's a spooky romance and an,0.12287405
excellently done film the acting and directing photography Franz Waxman score the dreamy atmosphere visually,0.020689873
it's a detailed movie the huge set design of Manderley is imposing and a little,0.03734208
fantastic when John Fontaine enters a room my attention is always drawn to the massive,0.053297173
size of the door because the handle is placed at such a height as to,0.022624891
make her look like a little girl lost in a giant's Palace like I mentioned,0.34938028
in my Jane Eyre review I'm extremely fond of Joan Fontaine in these kinds of,0.038537413
roles she was nominated for an Academy Award for Rebecca but did not win though,0.019372808
they let her have it the next year for her performance in her second Hitchcock,0.039399493
film of suspicion according to legend her co-star Laurence Olivier sword at his wife-to-be Vivien,0.072230294
Leigh didn't get the lead was brusque with Fontaine Hitchcock encouraged this behavior and was,0.024832636
rough with her himself to provoke an ideal performance this method is questionable but I,0.06085366
can't argue with the results because as the second mrs. Dewinter Fontaine is perfect I,0.035476238
sympathize with her awkwardness and insecurities oh so much and that makes it intensely satisfying,0.08790269
to watch her develop a backbone and find stand up for herself Laurence Olivier as,0.0965401
maximum de winter might be a little younger than the part calls for and the,0.035942532
silver they put in his hair isn't super convincing but it makes him look very,0.041685063
distinguished and he does a fine job I think I might have had a little,0.022368131
crush on him as maximum de Winter at some point when I was 14 maybe,0.28631783
I think this is probably my favorite of his performances although his Richard the third,0.033456076
is pretty great completely different from this though I can't help wondering of course what,0.01939343
it would have been like if Ronald Colman had gotten the part story goes the,0.01541164
Hitchcock wanted him for it and he was interested and even Olivier himself said Coleman,0.050317153
should be doing it but Coleman had a scheduling conflict and couldn't going through some,0.039403483
highlights of the all-around outstanding supporting cast there's Judith Anderson as mrs. Danvers the creepiest,0.08551734
housekeeper ever no one can touch her performance Menace just flows out of her she,0.22252056
is a creature of hatred and spite with something possibly a little off upstairs she,0.32737532
makes your skin crawl and her scenes with the second mrs. Dewinter in Rebecca's room,0.16586886
are move chilling written and choreographed and designed so well there's also George Sanders who,0.04065403
did two movies with Hitchcock in 1940 I prefer his more likable character in foreign,0.03657845
correspondent to Jack LaBelle but this is a classic example of him playing the unmitigated,0.071819216
CAD Gladys Cooper has a relatively small part but I was struck by how much,0.028296247
younger and breezier she seems here than in other things she and neither Bruce are,0.04408571
one of the film's brightest spots and I also mentioned Florence Bates as mrs. Van,0.017564174
hopper who's only in it for a short time but leaves her mark I like,0.09896802
the moment when Maxim tells her that he's marrying her companion I love reaction shots,0.2509216
and that's a fun one as far as faithfulness to the book goes I guess,0.02895877
it's faithful except for a few minor points and one enormous one which I'll get,0.04397396
to in a minute but I'm not really the best judge of faithfulness in this,0.03361306
case because I read the book years ago and I don't really remember much about,0.018287228
it I don't even remember if I liked it or not I know this story,0.027986271
is often compared with Jane Eyre and I will acknowledge that there our similarities since,0.016002988
they're pretty obvious but to me Jane Eyre and Rebecca are different they have separate,0.0340288
settings and storylines and sets of characters similarities between the two of them are about,0.022188531
as common as I would expect to find between any two stories of the gothic,0.04881583
romance genre so I don't dwell on them too much I do have a couple,0.03269178
things I want to say that take us into spoiler territory so here's that fair,0.035293315
warning to stop watching now if you need to I don't want to have it,0.19699946
on my conscience that I kept someone from watching a good movie by ruining the,0.04888102
ending even if the movie is 76 years old so continue at your own peril,0.092916176
okay first here's the enormous change that I mentioned the matter of the crime they,0.09884828
change it from murder to accidental death I guess that's quite a bit different there's,0.13781075
still the issue of getting rid of the body and lying about causes of death,0.22454175
but that's so much tamer than actual hands-on murder I would think Hitchcock of all,0.19673471
people wouldn't have been bothered by the original circumstance so what happened was they're concerned,0.023717789
that audiences would be too horrified and reject Maxim is this a censorship thing second,0.039873768
I want to express my appreciation for a scene I consider pivotal to the movie,0.050023142
and its central relationship and that is the confession scene and it's follow-up Maxim de,0.015895894
Winter and his young bride don't have the best relationship to him she's a nice,0.04523914
little thing amusingly different from his old associations he does love her but in a,0.07138751
distant often corrective way and secretly he's too damaged to believe her when she says,0.07188041
that she loves him and she's too timid to try to draw him out they,0.050747525
both know something's wrong but they can't communicate well enough to fix it the confession,0.02233088
scene flips everything over she has to track him down to the boathouse where she,0.13129261
finds him sitting alone in quiet defeat as he finally tells the truth about the,0.06314921
past everything between them is stripped away all pretense and shyness and they see each,0.07917814
other with new clarity she's surprised by his vulnerable and he by her loyalty and,0.029905992
strength the next scene shows her descending the stairs more smartly dressed and confident than,0.022849059
ever before she joins him by the fire and after some more discussion they share,0.20354353
their first real kiss of the movie she has now assumed the role of most,0.028294917
intimate confidante trusted with his deepest secret and with the air clear they are free,0.11900202
to restart their marriage with a better promise of happiness I love that and I,0.09444477
love the way it's communicated so that's what I've got to say about Hitchcock's Rebecca,0.029143691
I thoroughly enjoy this movie and I know others do too so feel free to,0.049338665
