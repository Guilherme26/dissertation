ever come out with the twist ending and a very good one too i did,0.078043334
not expect that twist any coming and i guess i could say it's one of,0.032670494
the greatest twist endings in cinema history but yeah this film is about a man,0.04149083
named francis and um he's talking to this like guy next to him and then,0.10314537
like this lady in white just like kind of walks past them like looking very,0.082724236

where um there's a man in the name of dr caligari basically he's like running,0.03720904
this big event thing where he's telling people to come be a son ambulance which,0.056212008
we know as today as a sleepwalker and that's just what they called him back,0.11103711

been awake for 23 years and that's how old he is and um this somnambulist,0.03614874
his name is caesar or as they would pronounce it probably back then cesar and,0.029707767
um cesar he's again he's like a sleepwalker he's been asleep all his life and,0.33080095
um you know at this main event he's like a crowd of people alan and,0.068174005
um allen and francis are one of those people and basically dr caligari keeps this,0.04063607
man named cesar in a cabinet not let's not not necessarily a cabinet but like,0.016048886
in this uh i want to see like kind of like a closet i guess,0.19392565
i don't know where he keeps them he keeps him hidden that's the point but,0.02374107
and then he opens it up and for the very first time cesar wakes up,0.027234614
dr caligari does like this weird thing where he makes him wake up and he's,0.083653495
woken up for the first time and um he says to ask he tells the,0.022019574
audience to ask cesar all these different questions so um allen goes up to the,0.027173417
sleepwalker and he tells him when will i die and basically cesar tells him you,0.40643498
will die by tomorrow at dawn and at that point i was like this just,0.30112955
got a little interesting and then you know what happens is it shows allen sleeping,0.017376592
at night and then just like a shadowy figure slowly going up to him and,0.05048611
killing him and stabbing him with the knife which is a very frightening scene by,0.79308575
the way francis and jane get married the next day and um they soon find,0.04935729
out that allen is uh murdered and um they find out that this dr caligari,0.2722689
and this man named cesar are up to something that isn't very good and that,0.03804385
they're killing random people in this town and that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much,0.47779474
sums up the story of the cabinet of dr caligari now the cabinet of dr,0.015136254
caligari is again a very very creepy movie um a lot better than i thought,0.084341295
it was gonna be honestly i really really like this movie a lot and um,0.06996069
yeah it really surprised me again that swiss standing was just fantastic i loved every,0.10823003
second of this movie well some parts got a little slow here and there because,0.058393147
you know it's a silent film and you know it's just it gets very slow,0.07000526
but the movie is actually only 71 minutes long or at least the version i,0.035149634
saw was 71 minutes long so it's definitely not very long you could easily like,0.060383376
sit through the whole thing and watch it the film is very creepy what makes,0.060009543
it creepy is like just there's no sound it's just all very eerie music and,0.058395144
there's just the whole thing is just music playing and it's just so very eerie,0.024939066
and it's kind of disturbing in a way that really makes the movie very good,0.060333487
the movie has also this very strange and creepy atmosphere to it that not a,0.034808394
lot of movies have nowadays and it's just very creepy i don't know why but,0.051482555
