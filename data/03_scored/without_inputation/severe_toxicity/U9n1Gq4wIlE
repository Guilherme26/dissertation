eve of their graduation it's time to cram four years of partying in the one,0.0598652
night film was truly one of the big surprises of South by Southwest and easily,0.01235246
one of my true favorites of South by Southwest all in general waiting to do,0.026596703
a review on this film until it got closer to release they due to the,0.035953175
fact that I really want you guys to have this film stuck in your membrane,0.11546923
and not forgotten smart is an instant classic and I actually think ten years from,0.08060097
now we will be calling this the Dazed and Confused of our time even though,0.059665643
it does have a lot of similarities to super bad just with girls it's a,0.119548135
meld of both these films put together but also with its own twists and turns,0.059265867
with inside of it due to Olivia Wilde's directorial debut on this film she directed,0.10834112
this film it was her directorial debut and it's a fantastic one out of all,0.09923409
the films i saw at South by Southwest this is probably one of the strongest,0.047244668
directorial efforts that I did see it's energetic it's fast paced but she captured a,0.018824697
lot of the great things that made me go back and think about high school,0.03919528
a lot of the things that very much anyone can relate to because one of,0.0063225706
the things that she dived in and focused on in this film wasn't the raunchiness,0.062118176
or the humor of it all but in fact it was the relationship between our,0.01718502
two main characters there are multiple scenes in here where it dives into their relationship,0.024420887
and touches on that friendship that I never thought the film would actually dive in,0.028285604
deep into but Olivia Wilde decided to tackle into that with a brilliant script but,0.060735922
the direction is what elevates that relationship to a whole nother level you know what,0.076941125
else elevates it out to a whole nother level is the performances in deeper and,0.044193473
beany failed scene have some of the best chemistry that I've seen truly in a,0.048678137
film and so long it got to the point where I truly forgot I was,0.021858599
even watching a movie it truly felt like I was there with them watching their,0.035287328
friendship develop overall this one night and all the insanity goes through actually one scene,0.045420736
in here that is pretty much one of the top 10 best moments of 2019,0.020295419
in film and cinema in general it is a moment that I'm not gonna get,0.017418498
heavily detailed into but it is just it's a scene that if you've seen the,0.04304736
film it happens at a party and Olivia Wilde decided to take out all the,0.09091663
audio and just go back and forth on the two girls talking and discussing and,0.16322143
the emotion that's pouring out of their face and their facial emotions is what got,0.13242742
the film striked the strongest and it very much dive deep into my membranous is,0.043179065
stuck there for the rest of the days yeah I'm like I said you will,0.060038812
know what that scene is if you've seen the film or when you do see,0.018552637
the film it is one of the most powerful moments in the whole entire movie,0.021716915
and one of the things that I really appreciate about book-smart it doesn't just go,0.031732585
for that raunchy comedy it isn't just a raunchy humorous to it there is a,0.028637486
lot of emotion to it there is a lot of care taken into this film,0.055113126
and that's what really dived me into because comedies in fact if they're making me,0.04335401
laugh I'm all for it but when they have a really good story and really,0.021697626
good characters to it as well that even elevates the film to another level even,0.024599157
when I try to compare it to both these two it's not fair because this,0.027305124
film is completely different to be honest you know what I'm saying that I'm comparing,0.056571208
it to these two films I would even go as far to say they're probably,0.14493287
better made films than both of these did you carry the same kind of dynamics,0.045063533
between them when I looked in say that it's kind of like Dazed and Confused,0.033096213
but just ten years later a lot of these cast members in this film are,0.027070979
absolutely phenomenal but I look in ten years down the road these are our new,0.052163035
stars that we're gonna be looking forward to and you looking back at Dazed and,0.02141958
Confused when you go back and we watch it you're like oh my god I,0.05975411
forgot Ben Affleck Milla Jovovich and even Matthew McConaughey are in this film and I,0.09591882
think we're gonna say the same thing about this I say it's kind of like,0.029401118
this film just with girls you look at it from the perspective of it's like,0.06265764
Michael Cera and Jonah Hill's friendship in here their relationship is very much tested but,0.016257754
I think book-smart tackled and delved into that a little bit stronger it's fantastic humor,0.090900004
all the way around and performances that are off the charts great I mean I,0.06784142
mentioned Kaitlyn Dever she's great beanie fill teens excellent Schuyler jazz Ando who I think,0.17635748
is a big standout in this film as well from all these different cast members,0.03852278
in here Jason Sudeikis has a very hilarious moment in here as well but truly,0.04346975
one of the big standouts of this film that I cannot wait to see what,0.05985389
she does next and I've been saying this every time I see her in a,0.054407366
film or TV show that is Billie lourd she stole a every single moment in,0.1229266
this whole entire film and every time she's on screen I was dying of laughter,0.06984362
I got ton I got an ab workout from this film and that's what a,0.047337793
great comedy does look smart is one of the best films of this year it's,0.038624555
a great directorial debut from Olivia Wilde it's energetic it's fast paced and it's contained,0.047514066
but she knew what she was going for and I just fell in love with,0.049516935
that whole aspect of the entire film I think it's again a great directorial debut,0.032570053
a great territorial effort and I can't wait to see what Olivia Wilde does next,0.06585052
some excellent performances throughout the whole entire film great script all tightly wounded into there,0.047934465
and I cannot wait to see what this whole cast does next I mean again,0.05866853
at South by Southwest they brought the whole cast out and watching them onstage getting,0.0694026
interviewed I just fell in love they're all gonna be stars and this film is,0.020620028
a star in its own with all that said I'm gonna get book smart and,0.047684357
