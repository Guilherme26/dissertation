out - the director of photography Bradford young Bradford young my man you did your,0.15258837
thing but she was saying in them how they purposely edited the movie because they,0.1259567
kind of they want you to realize the gravity of what was happening so they,0.076792784
slowed certain things down it was like it was like pow in slow motion because,0.10808066
you need to understand that the humanistic depth of what was happening and how real,0.076619774
this was supposed to really move you inside and for a movie Selma past a,0.10545689
lot of historical context into it was like two and a half hours Ava Duvernay,0.12841755

in an interview said that she was not able to get the licensing to Martin,0.13640364
Luther King speeches you know all of Kings speeches are copyrighted it'll they didn't have,0.11355935
the ease of just having these already crafted magnificence we just use they had to,0.19883968
rewrite and come up with their own speeches that still captured the essence of the,0.059785087
power of Martin Luther King as a-- or Eva and her crew have gotten some,0.10430606
heat about how they portray lyndon b johnson in the movie in that he doesn't,0.094902724
come across as like a true-blue supporter of the demands that Martin Luther King is,0.1145809
making about the civil rights movement and I think that's way more accurate than this,0.08040197
kind of whole idea of this white Savior that's so often presented about white men,0.31089434
who did push through less legislation for the civil rights movement I mean if you,0.107391775
go back let's just pause here because if you go back you can listen to,0.1913413
James Baldwin on camera being interviewed about the time that him Harry Belafonte Lorraine Hansberry,0.11373746
and a few other people up in Harlem had robbed Robert F Kennedy come through,0.14950928
and sit down and he thinking because he is a herald of the black man,0.5876557
at the time and politics that they often agree him with happy faces and Cheerios,0.10458246
and James Baldwin was like we stacked homeboy Dale and it tells him straight like,0.14085744
what you're doing is not enough you don't understand your privilege is proceeding you here,0.2418482
and you don't really understand the plight of the black man or the black woman,0.5876557
in America so let us let us break it down to you how this is,0.1886641
ain't--we ain't nowhere near the cherry being put on top of the civil rights movement,0.11473171
right now it's very realistic that as the president and what that means to be,0.07304601
the president that Lyndon Johnson did push back on certain things and that he was,0.06590421
playing to his own political benefit and he wasn't really just a champion of his,0.103547916
civil rights because he so believed in the rights of the black man I think,0.4914374
you know you kind of have like the political spectrum at that time what was,0.06241829
going on and you know I know the movie didn't even allude to how much,0.067477696
the Vietnam War and what was going on with that impacted the civil rights movement,0.12670948
and how kind of crazy it is you know I don't think the representation of,0.27223325
him in the movie was inaccurate by any stretch of the imagination so what I,0.09079477
appreciate it was the showing of women and I think this is what gets left,0.25055745
out of the conversation so much of civil rights it's how much women play the,0.24091356
role especially to the powers of Coretta Scott King who I think I mean I,0.049895834
think we kind of look back on everything with rose-colored glasses and we want everything,0.07108976
to just you know look back at it as if it was all prim and,0.09015696
proper and you know a white flag was raised and we won the war and,0.13695583
that's not really how it happened you know I think sometimes Coretta Scott Kings o,0.06589663
Hamas's played down in history in that you know they did touch on Martin Luther,0.10918861
King's infidelity and so you know rather than portraying her as someone who didn't know,0.11102365
or is it not causing any problem or is it not being a burden that,0.11304961
she took on you know I feel like they really kind of showed the strength,0.124949165
of what it meant for Coretta Scott King to be the wife of Martin Luther,0.07099909
King and the mother of his children and how she did impact the civil rights,0.15926065
movement you know oh my gosh well Malcolm X shut up in the movie house,0.4462689
yo they casted this movie so well and they touched on everything like I like,0.2420262
this nlgger was real I like this wasn't no I'm the civil rights movement was,0.30390108
everybody agree and everybody rose up and everybody was in comeuppance with each other no,0.14115861
they was really they really talked about how they play people against each other and,0.2244874
when Malcolm X show up my dual that was good that was that was the,0.06154416
whole exchange between Malcolm X accredits got King I was in their life no I'm,0.11935149
aware of the world around me and I'm aware of how the landscape of America,0.12151463
is changing and how what it means to be black in America is ever-evolving and,0.40333107
ever expanding and I think so often kind of you know there's been a downplay,0.31089434
about the culture of what what it means to be a black American or an,0.35465828
african-american or how you ever however you want to self-identify and I feel like for,0.23483148
me this movie kinda just show like how much weight our community and culture does,0.14952268
really carry like this is part of my own fabric I just walked out of,0.06449551
that movie just with so much pride but so much understanding of how much work,0.06002215
we really have to do this is my favorite my favorite scene was when Martin,0.039023437
Luther King after having a row ruff-ruff-ruff night he got up and called Mahalia Jackson,0.19281735
some wee hours of the night play by lettuce teeth but that's when I knew,0.15071909
the casting was on point we let us see rolled up out the bed and,0.24179381
singer Mahalia Jackson all he said to her was mahalia I need to hear the,0.050317015
voice of guy right now let me tell you my favorite song my favorite song,0.06282679
when I am down and out from the black brown and beige Duke Ellington album,0.1530622
it has come Sunday with Mahalia Jackson like I'm sorry to keep having to bring,0.07120184
up who should know I got I got my sternum smashed on by a young,0.53490317
man out here and he was still in my house I will I put on,0.22330067
come Sunday but coz identity in that moment I needed to hear the voice of,0.06213299
God and literally when lettuce II got up and sang as Mahalia Jackson give it,0.12447734
a moment and you know they kind of talk about the division between the younger,0.053016998
college-age students who felt like they had mobilized and King which is coming in with,0.13442962
the camera to take all their glory away Wendell Pierce play Hosea Williams who we,0.14168859
should all know courtesy of real houses of Atlanta because his granddaughter is Porsha now,0.079028495

motto was unbought and unbossed which you know in my shady behind the whole time,0.152508
in a movie at the end when they kind of do run buys of where,0.05649225
each person ends up I was waiting for them to get to Hosea and be,0.08358202
like he went on to be a civil rights leader through his unbought and unbossed,0.11823592
campaign but his granddaughter Porsha was bought for fourteen ounces of weave and his dumb,0.8871699
ass doorknobs that's what I waited for the whole time not shade mache go see,0.794439
it like it I think for a lot of people it's a great introductory to,0.14258198
American history I think it should provoke you to look up more about American history,0.10012809
what the civil rights movement really was at that time and how we can learn,0.09360559
from it and how we can take from it in 2015 and let me know,0.07233977
