a phone system man once again and welcome back to another review and this is,0.050979353
thanks to a nice guy named Cody Lane 618 who had sent me in this,0.09732028
film rear window which this was actually nice to see because I had seen a,0.16310227
lot of films that took notice from rear window and all out of those films,0.14994791
I enjoyed because I enjoyed disturbia which was sort of rear window for teenagers mimic,0.25930667
3 which I did like maybe 3 it was a lot better than amendment 2,0.054939013
I like number 3 because I like there was a rear window type of story,0.13812609
but using the mimic storyline I love road games with Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee,0.04445857
Curtis that was pretty much a rear window but in a moving vehicle in Australia,0.1512368
loved road games abominable that was a film with a guy played by Matt McCoy,0.19216748
was in a wheelchair out in the I'm this cab in the woods and you,0.23627672
dealing with a Bigfoot type of creature and I mean it's called abominable and they,0.4398901
had a real window stuff to it I just I loved that motif no I,0.080152415
have not seen the remake with Christopher Reeve maybe one day down the road but,0.06530401
I thought were windowed they did a good job I thought it was nice to,0.09226889
see the original after seeing all the tapes on it now I just say I,0.08897943
enjoyed this film I liked this film I can easily say this is one of,0.08940481
my favorite outfit Hitchcock films this and the birds I would say the bird is,0.06440361
them along and this is a close number - I thought Jimmy Stewart did a,0.05836039
great job in this role Grace Kelly was beautiful and actually a pretty decent actress,0.07637145
but I always say Grace Kelly send the scenes that the way hitch got shot,0.24003874
her and you know her coming to camera may look just absolutely beautiful if someone,0.19309828
asked what's what's a if you name what's the most beautiful woman you've seen on,0.18727928
screen I might have to say Grace Kelly in this movie cuz she was absolutely,0.13704155
gorgeous absolutely gorgeous in this movie and what's nice is Ashley has a pretty good,0.15437278
documentary real window ethics remembering and restoring the Hitchcock classic as well as a few,0.1503888
other features part of this collection I mean the story I mean when professional photographer,0.06617543
JB Jeff Jeffries James Stewart is confined to a wheelchair with a broken laid he,0.34902224
becomes obsessed with watching the private dramas of his neighbor's play out across the courtyard,0.08080036
and that's not actually interesting way hitched I doing that without words you just see,0.18416551
him sleeping he has a broken leg in a wheelchair and then going to a,0.4591181
pitcher he took up a racetrack and looks like a car coming towards them and,0.3783896
then other pictures so you get the eye and a broken camera to get the,0.113029875
idea that doesn't have to explain you did piece it together yourself and also a,0.09286029
picture of this woman on this magazine which is Grace Kelly which he probably took,0.1786957
that picture and of course you have this thing where Jimmy Stewart what's to keep,0.06850185
doing his job and Grace Kelly's like well you know what how'd you know you,0.08282918
should work at the fashion magazine that I'm at and I'm thinking Jimmy Stewart it's,0.066565
creased look at look at this girl look how this girl looks just say yes,0.4398506
and do whatever the hell she wants but that's like what do you do why,0.4031442
do you say no Jimmy Stewart it's nlgger Grace Kelly it's I'll be like yes,0.35077402
ma'am as long as you sit on my face I will photograph you for magazines,0.7757222
her forever but I know dirty 30 but I mean and like him watching the,0.36103085
people even sight there's this woman who's very lonely and they had this other woman,0.42392367
who seems very I know if you will call sexual you know she nlgger I,0.6547132
would say she's I wouldn't say settled more of like you know as a dancer,0.18356222
and revealing and clothing that's much as you can back to 1954 yeah this couple,0.09826941
have this dog up above you have this newlyweds who pull the shade down and,0.3267215
you can guess what they're probably doing and you have this sort of guy who,0.17243098
seems like he has a dominating wife and the guys actually played by Raymond Burr,0.09689519
and went cream and burr holy nlgger like the guy from the American version of,0.4760751
Godzilla can the monsters it's called and Godzilla 1985 that Raymond Burr is the villain,0.303856
in this movie my holy nlgger the guy from the American version of the original,0.31089434
Godzilla and the American version of Godzilla 1985 from Gaza Latino the monsters and Godzilla,0.45794585
1985 the brain member that remembers the villain in this I never realized that before,0.36727604
I pop this disc in I'm like that guy sounds familiar window oh nlgger that's,0.5077459
Raymond Burr and he also have like a guy playing a piano who I think,0.11343324
the guy playing the piano is the guy who created the the Chipmunks Dave Seville,0.08351561
like the guy who became the character de Sevilla he traded the chip month I,0.11065018
believe dr. Brown I believe the guy playing the piano is that guy I could,0.06500836
be wrong I could be wrong hey Chuck will quick rod Bagdasarian Ross not wrong,0.095214106
Ross Bagdasarian he was betting on by the stage name David Seville he was the,0.06743804
trader of Alvin and the Chipmunks so yeah the creator of elder and the Chipmunks,0.082202934
is the guy playing the piano in this which I thought Ian kind of pretty,0.14954323
interesting fun to see I think that's actually where Hitchcock has his cameo is during,0.13273475
one of those scenes I'm with the the guy playing the piano the songwriter it,0.1288951
pretty much another one I hadn't mentioned I was on my films that are like,0.15299779
rear window the original Fright Night love the original Fright Night the beginning part that,0.092915535
has a bit of a rear window Lisa first third of the movie has a,0.24363047
little bit of a real window vibe to it but then he hears this glass,0.30949923
break and someone says don't and pretty much throughout he keeps seeing this neighbor doing,0.1250216
weird things like going out late at night and carrying the suitcase and then the,0.07556273
woman's not there and then you know it's like he's he's dating in the dardan,0.46711534
and the dog keeps barking at the Raymond burse character and later on the dog,0.1540277
is found dead with his neck broken I'm he asks you know this guy who's,0.7578339
a cop who I thought he did good job to 1 del Korie I thought,0.115022995
the acting was good throughout I think everyone did their job well he has some,0.09222678
little bit of fun back and forth between him and Jimmy Sorrento course he doesn't,0.10590782
believe Jimmy Stewart I thought Jimmy Stewart did a great job you know just try,0.068661235
and get someone to believe him and then Grace Kelly starts to believe him and,0.07553212
she starts helping out I like that idea as well because it's not Grace Kelly,0.14955327
being an a Dean oh yeah oh you for this nlgger like they won't say,0.5876955
cos it's the 50s but you're full of nlgger know he they don't do that,0.5627895
I thought it was nice that she started to believe in her maybe I first,0.12037467
uh you know saw a bridge a gap between them but I thought that was,0.15598035
it was the same vision you know he was a beautiful girl good actress but,0.10179218
also she wasn't a nagging nlgger she was so helping him out and also sort,0.37166303
of the show that she can be a little bit adventurous as well I pretty,0.19011737
much I like pretty much the entire film is from Jimmy Stewart's home well you,0.05535942
don't really ever step out of Jimmy Stewart's home which I thought was interesting and,0.06670823
the way it was filmed I mean for I understand how was it that Jimmy,0.08591365
Stewart's place was the floor of the studio and then all the stuff here was,0.056969933
like they took it out and used the basement be like think of Jimmy Stewart's,0.07288092
place here and then the studio here's the basement so they clean up the basement,0.070359714
they used all that and build like this entire neighborhood inside a studio and it,0.13717753
mates so the Hitchcock can have some really cool shots the way it's all filmed,0.15201151
in the way that Jimmy Stewart's right there and he can actually see everything there,0.029295824
I thought the movie kept going at a good pace I always I don't know,0.07269015
if I say always but usually with this kind of plot it just keeps me,0.07739513
interested yeah I don't know that makes me a voyeur I just like watching people,0.15301624
but I just like the idea of a character being stuck in one place for,0.05615818
some reason either Chazz he's in a wheelchair or you know he's a truck driver,0.3516727
and you know that's his job or mm III like the guy is very sick,0.69542736
almost like a boy in the bubble type of shape so he can't leave I,0.110712454
always like the oh of course Jimmy Stewart his leg is broken the fact that,0.16363542
they're stuck in this one place and this whole world is enveloping and coming up,0.11205247
in front of them and in a way they can't go anywhere they just just,0.14079309
using these pieces here to soar you as the viewer are in the same spot,0.13953154
as your main protagonist what does that mean what did that part mean hmm that's,0.07470437
what they're doing I wonder what they're doing yeah I mean think about it have,0.08035973
if you there are times where I've been once a while when I go on,0.09763495
a long trip where you look at someone driving a car you go I wonder,0.12816699
what they're doing wonder what their life is I wonder you know what's going on,0.074887566
where they're going where they've been you know that sort of curiosity I think it's,0.057988986
that curiosity where you know you're trapped in one place and you're seeing this world,0.15324342
and it's also a mystery like what's going on what's that what's that I don't,0.09528757
know what it is it's that I thought it was a great idea that I'm,0.077408694
you know a lot of people a lot of films took from rear window and,0.18421993
I think it's a great I wanna say genre but it's a gimmick it's a,0.070572965
great gimmick the idea the one person being stuck in a place or and they're,0.11428724
in this one thing and they're watching from the outside and they're observing from the,0.057514474
outside and then because usually what happens is that outside all Sun comes into where,0.042887818
they're at right now and it's sort of it's you're on the outside and then,0.049716365
it just leaps into their life and also because of course by the end they,0.11527146
gotta be in danger and what you think is safe it's not safe anymore but,0.07905807
the final confrontation between Jimmy Stewart and Raymond Burr would udn interesting stuff that Hitchcock,0.08597678
does like Jim Easter uses the flash is there when the flashes of blinds again,0.09707853
the screen goes like this red and then it dissipates Talent if you were blinded,0.30088344
which I did Lou entrances to fight that ideas Ellen you almost have at least,0.08820236
for me you're trying to like Jimmy Stewart your trial does that girl use the,0.14986707
dancer and okay that's what's wrong with that girl all that girl's lonely and all,0.3514184
know she might commit suicide on you well you're almost like Jimmy Stewart's shoes and,0.74533546
seeing you know what getting pulled in to see what these people are doing that,0.06674804
now also this it's almost like you're trying to solve the mystery with Jimmy Stewart,0.05937357
I think that's another thing when you're kind of with the proton is tagging is,0.07961332
because you're seeing what they're seeing in a way you're hearing what they're hearing for,0.08178756
the most part I mean once a while hitch God does something where like we,0.087466635
the audience see about Jimmy Stewart see it but it's always from within the inside,0.06125817
of that room that Jimmy Stewart's in idea I think that is this for the,0.062145595
most part you're on the same page as your lead character so in a way,0.11279001
you know what they know from Adam for the majority you know as much as,0.085824855
they know and you're trying to solve as much as they're trying to solve and,0.065242566
trying to piece together well may miss this and this I mean to again the,0.06720755
a lot of moves I enjoy enjoyed disturbia road games Fright Night the original Fright,0.08132919
Night I can't think of one that did this and I didn't write now that,0.050365478
I think about it cuz the freighting I remade didn't even attempt that which f,0.094543286
you don't remake it why don't you just do it from the whole film be,0.100724
like rear window but with a vampire hell if you don't remake Fright Night the,0.40528622
beginning / a friend was rear window why you just had the whole movie like,0.118516974
that but then if you want to do a foot in disturbia which once while,0.14895293
I seem like they wanted you I think I swear I heard one of them,0.114366546
mention nlgger in the making of whatever the hell it was I don't know why,0.5001443
you just go that route then they what I know they tried well they nlgger,0.58750826
up with the reman I don't think they even attempted in the remake of Fright,0.10324203
Night there's a lot of reasons why laugh film sucks but even the woman who,0.8292821
sort of once awhile comes by Jimmy Stewart the sort help him with physical therapy,0.15925492
I thought Thelma Ritter I believe is her name I thought she she was pretty,0.17356272
funny at times I when jamester was trying to eat and she's describing I bet,0.12066802
he killed her in the bathroom no Jimmy she was trying to eat yeah you,0.73012507
know in the he's clean like just the way she's describing and jimster who's trying,0.11721731
to eat and all son loses appetite because of it and I thought Jimmy Stewart,0.18764049
dude great James Stewart Jimmy Stewart I was saying this is of the I haven't,0.06150366
seen tons of stuff with Jimmy Stewart well the stuff I've seen I was definitely,0.060441706
say this is my favorite role of his it's just the idea the idea works,0.07521754
the way he should kind of filmed it the way it was all shot in,0.24018162
studio in the way of looks is well done Bri still is beautiful play her,0.056626976
reveal where his shots are pushed as a camera on her and just one of,0.25556663
those like looks like an angel type of Lord's Grace Kelly and again she's knob,0.5358436
Hey our beautiful girl you just say a hot girl who can add great take,0.48311907
that Megan Fox why people call you hot but you can't add for nlgger this,0.33713314
is a girl who's hot and cannot her name is Grace Kelly so there you,0.4906114
don't it can happen it's not impossible to have of course that's if you think,0.09705416
Megan Fox lesbian if not well then she's such both ways well three ways and,0.7093121
you know the third way of suckin but Michael Bay's dduk but which I remember,0.79310536
one time Michael Bay wanted to remake the birds now I mentioned Michael Bay and,0.022487298
talking about Hitchcock hopefully they'll never happen just nlgger that but yeah I know there,0.3434452
was a remake of this that Christopher Reeve had done something I checked out one,0.07181533
day down the road anytime soon but one day down the road but what can,0.101508684
I say about rear-window it's a film that's darn into classic this I can understand,0.4382766
not vertical Virgo I'm sorry everything I say in that review I mean I do,0.10704029
not like vertigo at all rear window I can believe as a class and I,0.28904817
never got bored I was always interested I liked the characters I thought the acting,0.09709346
was really good I thought I liked the the idea which started from there is,0.03433905
I don't know if there were films before this I did that but there are,0.07001312
I don't know about but I thought was well filmed I thought hit shot do,0.20035914
a job directing it get me interested involved it was pretty decently suspenseful I mean,0.14580673
his dad knows how to do that Grace Kelly's beautiful and she's also not a,0.15398233
bad actress at all Jimmy Stewart did a great job remember overall trying to think,0.24052477
if I miss him anything else screenplay by John Michael Hayes dude good job with,0.14884187
that based on the short story by Cornell Woolrich very well done movie really nothing,0.10182889
I can say bad about this film I really enjoyed rear window it was nice,0.28868508
to see the original way it was done you know I saw all those films,0.13672046
that had taken notes from this nice to finally see the original and I was,0.05065062
not disappointed so Lane 6:18 Cody thank you very much I'm glad I have this,0.08697369
