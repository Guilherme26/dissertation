I'll hell and during the mutants run for the government Logan must also determine if,0.31089434
this is the fight worth fighting for and this is could in fact be his,0.16602246
true Redemption in life now Logan is the third and supposedly the final chapter of,0.07564822
the standalone Wolverine films and i believe the tenth installment in the x-men franchise some,0.111027054
kind of too lazy to look that up right now as far as standalone Wolverine,0.40963316
films go in my personal perspective I don't think they have a great track record,0.10279226
at all i think they're pretty bad first we have x-men origins wolverine probably one,0.36025387
of the worst superhero movies ever made just an all-around terrible film and second we,0.30671242
have the wolverine and it's probably okay at best I wouldn't call it great but,0.049804162
now guys we have Logan the third and final chapter of The Wolverine standalone fields,0.09748467
and everyone wants you Jackman to give one last great performance as this iconic hero,0.15104817
now I saw this film it's good it's not amazing it's just good now this,0.11496487
film gives an incredible and vibrant feel to the New Mexico location in which the,0.024950264
whole film is set in based on its surroundings it plays off as if it's,0.058472853
a modern Western but with the element of superheroes thrown in the mix the settings,0.07643519
felt dirty and grimy when you're looking at certain characters appearances and their environments or,0.44799224
even some of the actions they commit this is a straight-up superhero Western it's a,0.10725055
feeling that the x-men franchise are never really tackle for and it really helps pull,0.06414444
it off when they have a consistency of the tone throughout which is that dark,0.0925218
and violent feel that x-men fans have always wanted in their films and now I,0.38513663
absolutely mean when I say it this is the most violent x-men film that we,0.2895593
have ever received unless you count Deadpool I'd rather type person I just want to,0.097489394
see dudes get sliced up by Wolverine himself this is the movie you have been,0.16163331
waiting for this Wolverine film earns that hard R rating which leads me to another,0.26090932
praise I have for the film which is how well the action is directed james,0.03920849
mangold returns to the director's chair to bring us smooth and well shot action sequences,0.18487483
that easily out does some of the previous Wolverine films it's like he really knew,0.099230744
how to cut at a certain angle to really intensify what was going on in,0.08916367
the moment of the film you absolutely knew what was going on and it was,0.0505094
beautiful and james mangold directs his cast equally as great because the performances in the,0.124678575
film by far so the best you've ever seen in an x-men film first do,0.06279873
you have Hugh Jackman as Logan this is the best performance he has given as,0.089749455
Wolverine is he gives a certain death to the character that we have never seen,0.19649053
before now we all know that this guy has a past and he deals with,0.149927
a lot of internal pains but not like where you see in this film it's,0.11508071
to the point where you feel extremely bad for this guy and then you have,0.33572316
Patrick Stewart reprising his role as Professor X and just like Hugh Jackman proves how,0.098876834
great of an actor he really is once you see his condition in the film,0.09369056
or how he's dealing with certain things it's almost as tragic as Logan himself I,0.16342226
almost got to the point where I teared up for him just the dynamic between,0.050651006
these two characters and where they're at and they're pouring their lives it's just all,0.08928034
sorts of tragic it's just amazing acting bodies to and then we have boyd holbrook,0.08488702
at the main villain and heels pretty cool yo serviceable as the main villain he,0.3492228
has a couple scenes that proves he's an absolute dick head is this going to,0.87806237
be the film that you're going to remember months down the line I ask you,0.080955505
don't think so I mean he did what he could with what he had and,0.104519606
then we have upcoming actress Daphne Kane as X 23 and she's easily one of,0.061764684
the best parts of the film she kind of reminded me of a little female,0.19059676
Wolverine what she was perform an action she was awesome and badass and when she,0.3764211
was acting in particular scenes you can tell that she is going to have a,0.062539876
bright future ahead of her you're going to see more of her pretty soon those,0.16113442
aspects in the film absolutely astonishing to see in a Wolverine standalone now I get,0.042735383
to some of the things that I didn't like about the film and that is,0.033675637
a pretty sloppy plot now the premise is pretty interesting because the mutants are now,0.1532024
gone Professor X and Wolverine they're the only ones left and they meet at 23,0.14458185
pretty cool right what it's all about the execution how they get to that point,0.17486209
where they kind of just gloss over a lot of the backstory that gets them,0.0853849
to this point it's kind of like oh the mutants are gone so there you,0.17537835
go and I'm over here like well why and how because I want to know,0.088566385
some of the backstory so I can get behind what on the main focus and,0.084607005
the chance that they do explain itself a little bit further and they do it,0.07930482
in the most bizarre and odd way because it gets to a scene where Wolverine,0.10692706
washes a recorded video on a phone and it starts off with a woman saying,0.21336013
walls paraphrasing right here it's like this is what you need to know about a,0.07189981
to be and it shone like certain events that are happening while the woman is,0.13491973
voicing over the entire thing and it just shows like many different clips just to,0.04929702
throw exposition any of your like okay does this woman edit this thing on her,0.44744846
computer kind of took me out of them a little bit it is kind of,0.25156182
executed story arcs in a pretty sloppy way I didn't really appreciate it that much,0.32339412
also we have a straight of characters in the film that if you were to,0.062370908
take them out completely it wouldn't be any different because they're ultimately a distraction of,0.10789597
what was going on in the main focus not much of a secret anymore that,0.075521536
Caliban is in the film and this introduction and story arc was like oh I'm,0.043744
here to help people do things in you know take up space we didn't really,0.075924926
get to know much of this character all we know is that he was there,0.05235791
just to do things and I just repeated myself and there's another thing in the,0.06448376
film that really infuriated me I mean I have to be as vague as possible,0.24133196
because it goes along the lines of spoiler territory but there's something that's just thrown,0.09680125
in there that Logan has to fight in the middle / end the film and,0.063736014
it's like why did that have to be in there it was about as lame,0.41599742
as him fighting that giant robot Samurai thing in the Wolverine it was forced and,0.13215289
it didn't need to be in there the entire thing is dumb now if you're,0.55687124
a fan of the x-men franchise or the Wolverine films this is going to be,0.0987034
your absolute heaven right here but if you're someone who just wants to go in,0.079062045
and enjoy a great film and you're just going to find it to be good,0.11285315
because I say if you want to see Logan it's best to see it at,0.0693463
the matinee price from a technical standpoint it was pretty good and also in the,0.056393623
filmmaking department but as the story itself it wasn't really that good for me but,0.07206012
anyway guys thank you so much for watching my review for Logan and I want,0.15197928
