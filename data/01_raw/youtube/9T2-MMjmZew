hi everybody my name is mary on this channel i watch movies and series that i've never seen before today i will be watching black panther for the very first time let's go [Music] hi everybody welcome back to another marvel movie normally i go into these movies blind i don't look up stuff up front but today i did because i know that this movie is a very important cultural perspective and i wanted to look into that a little bit more before i get into it so i like really can notice that as well so today it's actually the first marvel movie that has a black lead superhero it's also the first marvel movie with a black director and mainly black cost and what i've read as well black women in powerful and leading positions so honestly i think that that's super important to pay attention to and not just like go over and act like that's not important because the fact that it's only the first time this happens is quite late i would say but i think it's super important because i feel like especially when i look at younger kids it's important for them to have super heroes role models that they can identify with they know that they can dream about being a superhero as well when it comes to their race gender sexual preference and so forth it's only sad for a kid if you look at superheroes and none of them look like you that's just heartbreaking so i'm so glad that this is happening i think in the world that we live in today it's more than important and that's why i also really appreciate this movie i did read which is absolutely heartbreaking that chadwick boseman actually passed away it's just so incredibly sad and i think it's especially it feels very weird going into this movie know that he made this and put his foot in it got very much appreciated for it and then sadly a disease took over so i want to go in with a lot of respect for him in this movie i think that's everything i have to say for it and we shall see how it goes i am excited a lot of people say that it's a very favorite movie of theirs so yeah i cannot wait if you like this movie as always make sure to like and subscribe commenting always helps to generate interesting discussion in the comments and i learned so much from them so if you know facts about them of have opinions always let me know and if you want to see the full reaction you can always do that over on patreon there are poster full watch long style reactions let's get into this one the wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight and we still hide baba yes why nice it's like futuristic as well hello whoa [Music] come on let me see how you are holding up oh dr dude is like what the hell is going on because i want you to look me in the eyes and tell me why you betrayed wakanda wait what zuri what did you lie to me you liked him too did you think that you were the only spy we sent here damn it's not level like a spy spying on the spy the tiny nation of wakanda is mourning the death of its monarch king tachaka the suspect has since been apprehended oh i was so red which i think is really nice that there's not going to be another challah but they're not going to replace the actor i think that's nice because otherwise that would feel really icky i think no needle koi i can handle this alone she has her doubts but okay i never freeze imagine if you have a gun like that and you see your bullet just going like all the way hi don't freeze dude she got him good in frost oh gorgeous this never gets old whoa all right damn i always love in movies when i do the futuristic combined something else like i love the entour as well that you have like the old gods and the futuristic tunes and here you have the futuristic buildings and world in a very nature environment i love their warrior outfits as well did he freeze headlights oh my god this is so good like right in front of him as well no even behind his back jory sorry mother how are you feeling today mama your father and i will talk about this day all the time he is with us oh that must be so heartbreaking because you're happy for your kid and you're so proud of your son combine that with the laws of your partner oh they tell me you're the expert ah you could say that isn't that really awkward with her coffee in seventh century foola tribe i believe no but it's from wakanda wait i'm gonna take it off your hands for you you ain't checking for what you put in your body oh damn coffee hey somebody get some help come here hey come here [Music] i never get kissing while action is going on in that movies adrenaline rush is already like going a little bit and that moment you're like yeah i would be like okay let's go that's amazing whoa of goosebumps i now offer a path to the throne ah they take his power away and then he still needs to prove that he's worthy the river thread will not challenge today does that mean that they all respect him as a leader this corset is really uncomfortable so could we all just wrap it up and go home i thought that was going to be really wrong imagine being late and then want to challenge rude i accept your challenge then i thought this was going to be like a nice moment or everybody recognized him but i guess we'll just have an in-between step it's a really big guy no powers they both fall down thank god like the i rather die thing king t'challa the good thing is now though that he did fight for it so he can be like you guys get got the chance and i won so now shush allow the hardship to restore the powers of the black panther oh i like how they do your time to put a lot of rituals in there oh stand up you are a king are they only indirect obama or do they come to this language i am not ready to be without you i want to be a great king baba just like you oh my god he was there my father oh what a whole moment ulysses claw crow has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years i will bring him back i can't imagine that this is difficult for the people if they just made him king and now he's going to be a hero i can't imagine that for some of them that will be like do you not need to be here but i also very much understand the decision to go my king stop it stop it updated to interface directly with my sand table see i also really love her she's like the lead tech person interesting guess what i call them sneakers spread out the buyer is likely already here just spotted an old friend who works for this oh what oh i know chloe was in this too agent ross you are buying from club do me a favor stay out of my way you know what i think i'll just take these oh stand over here sick you look just like your old man [Music] damn good reaction time i made a crime i was gonna see him in the rain sorry remote driving system activated [Music] what [Music] oh [Music] all right

when she wants to play nice americans don't hurt me what is love baby don't hurt me me no more okay oh sorry i spooked i see you took your time didn't you he just jumped in front of me oh i don't think he'll make it here this will stabilize him for now ah okay we can't save him now we will all see him himself this man is a foreign intelligence operative this is like the worst i cannot just let him die what did his dad say about being too good great another broken white boy for us to fix you really want to go to wakanda there's sandwiches you'll just be an outsider [Laughter] there was a man today wearing a ring i identical to this one he helped claw escape from us and he was wearing this ring i would not like the answer i promised the king to say nothing i am your king now your uncle fell in love with an american woman they had a child he drew his weapon on me oh my god your father killed his own brother save that was his kid oh oh my god yeah i would be best too right if your uncle gets your father and then you're left by yourself oh no and they're gonna like that he brings this gift oh no oh all right where am i don't scare me like that colonizer okay is this wakanda no it's kansas don't touch anything my brother will return soon he's just saying they're like what so what can i can i move what can i do oh that's so cool i'm standing in your house serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people justice your king couldn't deliver dude be careful man your father murdered his father don't be pissed no i want the throne oh whoa i thought i was gonna say something like i want to be home and acknowledge then no in dingle and tadaka indiana gotten jobu huh i found my daddy with panther claws in his chest hey auntie hi all deep it's so casual i lived my entire life waiting for this moment that's not a good way to live though just so i could kill you imagine if you're filled with so much hate i'm like there's no way chella is going to lose but then i'm also like or he will and that he needs to get it back and that kind of stuff but jeez what a beautiful scenery though i was turned so bad this is for my [ __ ] he's not even gonna let him yield jesus take me or don't take anybody i'll take you both uncle james [Music] oh my god what a shocker you are the greatest warrior wakanda has help me i am loyal to that throne i really feel like this movie does a great job at showing how people react differently to certain situations is this happened a few times already what has happened to our gun there's no way he died right there's no way i just oh i should have taken you back long ago instead we are both abandoned here damn and the sad part is that you still hear that today imagine as a kid that death around you is normal that you're used to that so when it comes time for another king we will be ready another king burn it all what dude this is not the way i think he is focused a lot on the part where he gets revenge and gets to drone but not really much on how to actually deal with that once he gets a drone we're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our war dogs so they can finally rise up and kill those in power and their children and anyone else who takes their side imagine if you say that we're going to kill them and their children like are you even yeah i would not like to be in that position either my son was married in ritual combat the new king is uh shut up now one more word and i will feed you to my children kidding we are vegetarians [Laughter] is why we are here only you can help us stop him damn so he's only their best option come with me it's interesting that for them it's an outsider but if you look at all the other tribes they seem to be fine with it they seem to be like okay you won you have the right impossible he's in a coma one of our fishermen found him at the edge of the river border nakia the app oh but he's going to want the herb mommy's gonna let them give it to him why didn't you bring the boy home you were wrong to abandon him i chose wakanda it's a kiddo and you are wrong all of you are wrong to turn your backs on the rest of the world no more i cannot stay here with you i must write these wrongs yes let's go the black panther leaves look at this a handheld sonic cannon powerful enough to stop a tank they're like yeah dude we know we grew up here [Music] what he lives shh don't show your happiness what's up i never hear that i am not dead all that challenge [ __ ] is over with i'm the king now this must be so confusing for everybody involved like yeah but we but what uh we rather review but he won but did he win but like [Applause] what i was gonna like if i had to guess the kill this clown thing would really upset him and be like i still grew up with this guy you are not fit to be a king yes yeah here we go i was worried for that that we had two black panthers [Music] it was a fair try so what do i do i have to fly it oh my god good luck agent ross yeah i don't know what i'm counting on you smile i love the music i made it american style for you get in all right i'm on it oh no i got him what do i do if there is anyone who knows how to close it it's her right [Music] come on lady get him you'll never be a true king oh no oh i really thought for a second that he was going to get her these battles are sick [Music] oh you can power it off but also his oh they came yes [Music] it's actually incredibly sad thank god i have goosebumps hell of a move my pops said wakanda was the most beautiful thing you ever seen i was thinking like they probably can just save him as well it's beautiful maybe we can still heal you so you can just lock me up just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from the ships they knew death was better than bondage oh i thought you meant coachella for disneyland why here go chill out disneyland this is where our father killed our uncle they're tearing it down we are not telling it now i bought this building this will be the first walk on an international outreach center you're kidding yeah yeah imagine these kids on the on the like once glory oh man i love the ending this was such a strong movie in terms of like you have that superhero element and again like the super cool look at my kids so i was gonna say that it's such a strong movie in terms of like still you have the marvel element and like the superhero and the combination of futuristic very traditional elements which in my opinion is still awesome but then you also have that strong message that's behind the movie and what i said before i really feel like i did a good job how was this movie perceived when it came out did it reach the goal i think it's also very strong of marvel to make that decision to make it like this and the end with the little kid is literally what i said at the beginning that he looks at a superhero and is like who are you my name is king t'challa we will be sharing our knowledge and resources with the outside world we must find a way to look after one another what kind of nation do farmers have to offer the rest of the world oh he knows oh nice it's actually strong as well he's like i don't need to uh you you shall see mystery the music was also so good right that modern with traditional again i love it good morning sergeant barnes bucky come much more for you to learn oh wow i i need to like the last time we saw him he went away with captain america right with the confrontation with iron man i think was the last time oh and the next one is infinity war yeah i i love this movie and i think it sent such a strong message as very strong today still years after and sadly will still be important for the next years to come i think it's great that they did that of course i can only speak for my own experience i like seeing strong female warriors and leading lady in tech like all those things are like yes so i hope that this happened and people from the black community felt the same from their representation so let me know what you thought about this movie i think it's great i think it's great that they worked on that implemented that in the sphere of a marvel superhero movie and i am so excited for infinity war because my comments are filled with people like counting down towards that movie so i'm like i don't know what to expect but i guess it's gonna be great so i cannot wait to record that for you all i hope you enjoyed this reaction if you did make sure to like and subscribe leave a comment with your thoughts and as always full
