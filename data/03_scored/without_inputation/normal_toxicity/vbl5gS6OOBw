so I saw the Dunkirk movie this review I guess of this movie there's going to be a lot of spoilers my friend there will be a lot,0.095226124
the reason I'm reviewing this I didn't expect to do this video at all the reason I'm reviewing this is because this is my all-time favorite movie I was freaking shook us to the core to the freaking core of the earth and myself shook by this movie so uh the whole world seems to know that Harry Styles first movie is Dunkirk,0.46355128
so early on like last spring blast some time where I wasn't in school that's all I remember I looked up Harry Styles while he was on his break,0.060490105
and I'm like oh interesting,0.10431982
he's going to be in a movie not just like I'm gonna see that movie you know,0.12675038
when you're a directioner or you just like,0.22983694
Harry Styles or any of the members you just kind of want to like support them and whatever they do hence the movie like a bunch of Directioners are going to see the movie because you know it's like your baby,0.28619245
you know yeah baby kind of growing up and becoming his own,0.24142286
oh man,0.10534196
he's not even a baby,0.4708097
he older than me,0.16051635
my friend I know it don't look like it,0.12784594
but he is and he's living his life and his see he's succeeding he's freaking finessing everything so naturally,0.5625224
I didn't know what the movie was there was no trailer,0.05091693
there was nothing much about it,0.08347261
it was just like he's in a movie no I'm going to see that so time passes,0.15482144
and then I found out the movies called Dunkirk,0.10549552
I'm like oh great I'm going to buy tickets when it comes out didn't think much about it was like supporting my man,0.1325614
Harry Harold Edward Stiles that one and so originally I was brought to it because of Harry I'm not going to lie to you a few more like a little more time passed and I actually saw the trailer,0.15059112
yeah yeah I thought it wasn't even playing on it kind of hit me by surprise those in the movie theater with my friends and it just is like Dunkirk burnt,0.35626483
you know like the trailer,0.0645083
just did the trailer it just did its thing,0.059581764
and I was like oh god this is the one with Harry in it too right uh-huh mm-hmm,0.0916624
so we go this is going to hurt me more in my feelings,0.40791613
and I was a besting it too so it did basically more came out more interviews more trailer time everything kind of it just became more and it kind of built up and yes but mmm my god thing with war movies is I personally,0.15860787
they're probably one of my favorite movies and I'm like I suck at history but I really like more movies for some reason the reason I don't watch it that much,0.50869036
it's because Tyra my bunny is on the floor,0.15119289
if you can hear that I apologize okay buzzing with me and more movies is that I usually don't watch them just because they're kind of like emotionally kind of like okay like,0.22433221
why did we have war,0.28632712
and I kind of get mad at the fact that there's so much hate that we had to like fight with other countries like there's so much bad stuff that we had to fight with each other,0.23965049
so I get really like saddened kind of by war movies,0.18590337
so I just don't watch that many but they're like my favorite type of movies which is weird,0.117349535
I found out that Christopher Nolan directed it honestly I haven't watched any movies from Christopher Nolan because I have this gap of like not washing movies in my life and I don't know why I haven't watched any of his previous movies as far as I know that's going to change okay,0.092835404
so I was sitting there was my friend and my mom and my friend sister and we were watching the movie it starts right lights went down movie begin,0.1341177
oh my god it just started as already action like we went straight into it,0.11843368
they had the main character,0.08107467
I don't think any of them have names except for one or I wasn't paying attention if they actually did have names,0.07147352
but the main character we just starts off and he goes,0.054501932
and he's in with a group of people,0.17184381
and then straight off the bat like they're just getting shot they did they gone for the rest of the movie that's why I five people got paid their five dollars,0.48060277
and now they're good and they just great and they're dying that was over,0.18980421
so you already start with like boom action you're intrigued,0.10086227
he got your attention,0.08253601
he Christopher Nolan,0.09944539
yes he knows what he's doing he was and some at territory,0.14801796
I'm assuming that's why he was getting shot at him and his group,0.41070133
and he was like the only survivor,0.07397272
he went with the French although you know English and French allies they don't like each other,0.1938018
so they were like okay come here and go somewhere else like bye so he just went and he found his other English people on the beach and they were all trying to get out of Dunkirk on the way he was about to take a dump very good touch on the movie because you just don't expect to see that in a movie great um,0.3173506
and well he didn't written same thing by the way,0.1049705
and there was a guy burying a body and he switched coats,0.35592803
so he had the English coat on but he wasn't English from England,0.14911216
but we don't know at this point where he's from um then the story continues,0.08688218
they're trying to get out and basically Germany just keeps like sudden bombs and killing a lot of people so they would just have to go back on shore and just try to survive but they would send more boats try to survive spend more boats try to survive,0.4863693
and we have like these three point of views right a little boat like a little vacation boat one they just say on the sea usually was going out to Dunkirk so they can bring some people back to England,0.13846415
the second one was a pilot also going to protect them from all all these planes that kept on shooting their ships,0.23432416
so they were sending the airport and so we had one of the characters it was three planes,0.03156218
they were going out there,0.04076051
and then they had the other point of view which is the one we started with is where they're already in Dunkirk and trying to escape so they have a few scenes in the movie I'm not going to like tell the whole story because you need to see the movie there's just like a few scenes that really stuck out to me,0.09617631
one was when they were like really losing hope they just had a random guy,0.15175878
we didn't know him or anything,0.085072935
he just went into the water,0.07321825
and he just jumped in and drowned themselves like he literally gave up hope and not only him but everybody they had the scene where they had the boat coming out,0.46949914
and it was leaving the port,0.07120219
they were leaving they had their bread,0.1748479
they were kind of just like okay we just go back to England and do whatever they need to do,0.3488773
and they had I think a torpedo that just hit a ship and there we go and the ship was gone and in the room they were in it was like locked because that's just how they were at the time,0.09828041
and the guy that we didn't know that who's not English was out while all the English soldiers are in there,0.118145496
and he was out just kind of like thinking about what he was doing,0.111848705
and I think he was just contemplating a lot of things,0.09833572
and so he was outside of the ship and they got hit and everybody was stuck in that room the ship starts like tilting and they had water coming in and literally they were just drowning in this room and so many were trying to unlock it but they were already like this,0.1772808
it was almost impossible,0.047520448
and then the guy we don't know where he's from yet opens it,0.16057505
and then they all like come falling out and they go back to shore and that it was such a freaking emotional like I can't describe it how good of a seeing this was it was such an emotional scene and you just felt it and you saw all these characters and everything oh like if my god just saw like how helpless is basting then like they kept trying,0.4479217
and then but it just like stopped like I was brought to tears,0.09037558
I'm almost crying four times in this movie I don't want to tell I've never done like a movie review I don't want to tell too much as a story,0.09055737
it's just like,0.05661034
it's such a good story something I wanted to mention what they had since the very like first scene this ticking it was ticking and ticking and ticking very subtle in the background but it was happening the whole time that was telling you that just time kept passing and rushing everything like everything needed to be done,0.035117254
and it's just not being done,0.14954376
it's kind of like the ticking feel of what like what I was feeling around the end of the movie they had actual like ships that came by and they were back in England,0.1194447
they were on the train and while he's boarding,0.088656835
the Train Harry's character Alex a butthole by the way there's um you'll see why when you see the movie like you just you you're not meant to like his character,0.6687275
he's real tough,0.109397374
and like you know you're just not supposed to like him,0.18870293
oh my god by Harry's acting,0.06567211
it like this being his first movie it's just weird tonight like usually don't notice when you see like a pop star going some,0.1268823
so this was like a whole different thing for me but like where did you learn how to act,0.15385239
there was a scene where I was just like so surprised,0.042679038
and this whole movie like I know I originally heard of it because of Harry but I forgot Harry was in it like it was such a beautifully made movie all the angles all the things in like the color grading was so great and like beautiful and it just fits so well and you just felt every single character and you felt every death and there were so many deaths and you just felt all of it and how like you just felt the hope leaving and they had something like panic scenes and like just you you're like stomach went into a not like you didn't know how to feel and all you can do should sit there and watch the movie and I think Christopher Nolan he's just a genius in the way that he made this movie like,0.086549036
I don't,0.077960104
know how his brain even thought of this like how did he make such a great movie,0.31089434
I don't freaking have a clue anyways,0.40526617
they were brought back to England and s and they were getting there's a guy handing out towels,0.1919835
and he was looking down the whole time it was ticking and was ticking his ticking everything,0.0945249
it was like a very subtle tick,0.12973629
they had the main characters like the nice guy,0.07152639
the guy you like,0.0805422
and then they had Alex,0.07007203
so Alex was the first one walking into the train,0.06334809
and the guy was looking down,0.151701
and he was he said congrats and then Alex looked back and he was like for what we only survived or something like that and it was like that's enough,0.098868445
and then I was just kept walking in the train,0.04881107
and then the main character he got his towel,0.09286988
and then the guy was looking down who's handing the towels and said that that's good that you like survived felt his face meaning,0.12485988
he was blind,0.15163906
and then after when they were in the Train I've said that dumb guy couldn't even look me in the eye to say congrats or whatever and he was just you know like they need completely like two different things,0.7686546
and that's when the ticking stopped like as soon as he said that and that like I don't know like I feel like I should know what that means but I don't,0.05943151
and this whole movie just kept me freakin alive guys,0.6229327
