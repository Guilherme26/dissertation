Jordan peels horror follow-up to get out has finally arrived US is genuinely scary but does the story pack a punch or does it peter out we meet a family who is going on vacation in Santa Cruz to the mom's childhood home and they encounter a group of doppelgangers who just begin this night of terror first let's not compare this to get out I mean this is its own unique story it's not a sequel by any means so to really compare it in that way or to treat it as like hey this is get out part two it's totally unfair the acting in this is phenomenal Lupita Nyong'o plays Adelaide who is the mom and red who is the doppelganger she is awesome at both because what she does is she plays them so differently that they are their own standalone person with all of the unique traits and just nuances to that but she plays them as the same character as well so that you can truly be a doppelganger and you see that they also share slight mannerisms here and there and oh my gosh what she does with her voice as the doppelganger is just downright creepy and weird I mean you have to strain to listen to it a little bit because it's kind of like this inhalation talking and it's it rises and falls and just as scratchy and then is barely audible and then as fierce and and powerful and Wow I mean standout performance in this she is spectacular Winston Duke is gave the dad and he is awesome too because what he does is bring some comedic relief to the story but that's not to say that he's like some doofus or he's a or a fool because he's not I mean he is strong he is smart and I just love though that he is full-on dad joke I mean when he he's full of them he just brings him and he commits to them and you see the kids roll their eyes and even the wife rolls her eyes and me as a dad I'm like yeah that was awesome I totally get that the kids in this are great too I mean they are smart they are aware and their doppelgangers whoa those things just need to go I mean it is Sain Zhora the girl her double has this smile to it that is just terrifying really I mean if there is something so not right about it she just kind of  her head a little bit and then has this and I can't even do it justice by any means I mean she was awesome at that and the boy is just I as he crawls around as the doppelganger I mean he's got this mask on and he's he's almost like animal-like and it just the whole the whole imagery and their mannerisms and their movements are just oh not right Elizabeth moss and Tim Heidecker are also in this but honestly they're barely in it I mean they are such small minor roles they're fine at what they do but they're pretty insignificant really Pele has really created an atmosphere of creep in us I mean he is patient with his shots without belaboring anything I mean he knows when to sit on something and when to pull off and when to move it and some of the tracking and just the slowness and the patience to do certain things and then some quick movements when it's called for that also so just the the differences in all of his shot choices and even the way that he frames different thing in different areas of the film just really draw you in and they just they like hyper focus you and then you had this soundtrack in this score really it's more of the score that is off-putting and it messes with your mind and it sets up this tone of just creepiness and not full on terror but you know that something is coming and you don't know what it is but you're pretty sure you're not gonna like it the story in us is really layered and complex I mean yes on its surface it is a horror psychological thriller movie and it is digestible and it is accessible by everybody but I know that Peale did not just make a straight-on horror film just like in get out I mean he had a horror and a psychological thriller in that but he was also making a point in us he's also making a point and I'm I'm gonna get into that right now in this video but it's definitely see it multiple times I mean I'm going to see it in just a couple days again because I want to catch things that I missed the film opens in 1986 in Santa Cruz and the thing it kept running through my mind is well really two things first off Santa Cruz in the mid 80s was not a place to be and then I kept expecting to see Kiefer Sutherland and Corey Haim on the boardwalk someplace and if you don't understand what I'm talking about and you don't get that then just go look it up and then it'll make a little bit of sense it's not very funny but don't at least make sense I had a blast with us I mean Jordan Peele has solidified his horror director writes in my mind this is a spectacular film and you know once is a fluke doing it twice that shows some real talent and skill if you like psychological horrors or thrillers then you're definitely gonna want to check this out there is no sex or nudity but there is a lot of profanity and a lot of violence I give us 5 out of 5 couches
