Logan is directed by james mangold and is supposedly the last time we will ever see Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine and Patrick Stewart playing Professor X in this movie which is set quite far into the future,0.097763926
we can see that all mutants are pretty much extinct and Logan and Charles are pretty much hiding out in the middle of nowhere trying to have very little to do with anything until this young girl called Laura enters their lives who is on the run from an organization,0.13864402
and she may or may not be related to Logan in more ways than one believe it or not this was my most anticipated movie of the year the trailers look very promising,0.051392913
it was nice to see James Mangold who directed the Wolverine which I actually quite like coming back for this one,0.11153801
and I also wanted to see how they were going to handle Hugh Jackman's last outing as this character and I've gotta say they did it in the best possible way they could have done,0.058625337
because this movie is amazing,0.08556236
now due to the success of Deadpool this movie is rated fifteen or if you live in America rated R and it shows I mean from the opening scene alone you've got blood swearing and limbs flying everywhere and it's kind of satisfying,0.2294408
as the movie goes on you can tell that they are pushing this 15 rating as much as they possibly can the swearing gets a lot more frequent the violence gets a lot more gloria and brutal as the film goes on and there are a couple of times near the start of the movie where you do feel as if they're pushing it a little bit,0.15213941
but by the time the movie kind of spreads out and kind of evens out where the violence is in the movie it's kind of a lot more easier to take in also all of this swearing and violence doesn't just happen for the sake of swearing and violence it all feels very warranted and actually feels worth it,0.1384816
and this is easily backed up by James mangles superb direction I mean this is easily the darkest comic book movie I can think of since the dark night,0.094504535
it's literally there's very little happiness in this movie there's a couple of times that make you laugh,0.09948776
but throughout the most of the movie it's very dirty very grimy,0.47116965
and just very depressing overall,0.38184783
I mean not like I said not the whole movie is depressing but it just has that very realistic and grounded feel throughout,0.10021386
the majority of the runtime the way they approach this movie by stripping back a lot of the aspects most comic book movies nowadays have and making it almost like a independent movie with it's very stylish,0.0626053
yet gritty cinematography really shows and actually makes the movie more personal than your average comic book movie the performances in this movie are universally great,0.15511215
but the two standouts are easily Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart who give what could be argued as career best performances Hugh Jackman absolutely nails it as Logan,0.07841662
he's been playing this character for 17 years now,0.05434177
but this is easily the best he's ever been as this character,0.094752364
he's broken,0.14220135
he's aged,0.102838024
you can see that his healing factors not working the way it used to and all hope that he did have is just gone,0.057359748
he really does not trust anybody and doesn't want to be around anybody because he knows that they will get hurt Patrick Stewart on the other hand gives just as an emotional performance as Hugh Jackman does and is kind of sad looking at Professor X now because the what they've done in this movie is they've given his character a mental illness which plays around with the telepathy and mind control powers that Professor X has and it makes his character really vulnerable and kind of fragile and it's really sad to watch because you've seen these two characters in their prime in previous movies and just seeing them in what looks like a shell of what they used to be now it's kind of emotional,0.17467259
and also where Logan has just completely done with hope,0.038600367
you can tell the child does have a little bit of hope left even if it is a very desperate means of the word hope,0.11450043
but you can tell that he's trying to make Logan believe again Daphne King as the little girl Laura,0.21483184
I thought was very good,0.067016415
even though she barely says anything throughout,0.13686578
the first two acts of the movie but she makes up for it with some very convincing facial expressions and just by generally kicking ass in all fairness,0.8606264
I think she actually kills more people in this movie than Wolverine does also Steven merchants in the movie and he's not as annoying as I thought he was going to be he was actually a very good character,0.41542038
I mean his character could have been cut from the movie and it wouldn't have make difference,0.078714006
but I thought his performance was actually pretty good for what it was,0.070309386
now unfortunately I do have one very minor problem,0.15460147
and that is regarding the villains,0.14875671
now don't get me wrong,0.123994626
I actually quite liked the villains in this movie I thought they were very interesting,0.1414562
the motivations made sense for the sake of the movie and they were both acted very well especially the guy who plays Donald pierce,0.118457064
the guy with the robotic hands from the trailers I thought he was specifically very good but they do fall under the same problem that most MCU villains have which is the fact that they're kind of there for the sake of being a bad guy and they're not that memorable apart from that I absolutely loved this movie and it was everything,0.18204966
I wanted to see in a final installment like this the violence was incredibly brutal at times hard to watch but yet they also knew when to be heartfelt and emotional,0.15347709
and actually made me tear up more than once and that's surprising because I don't usually cry,0.11417211
these kind of things,0.0924221
the last time I cried at anything was when David Tennant left Doctor Who like that alone made me a crippling mess on the floor,0.15986142
Logan kind of did the same thing as well and because of this i have to give it a 10 out of 10,0.15447764
it satisfied everything,0.077906966
i wanted to see in movie plus a little bit more so guys that was my review of Logan,0.15202221
