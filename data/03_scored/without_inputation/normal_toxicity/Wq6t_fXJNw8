yeah now personally,0.06323468
i'm not a big fan of black and white movies or silent films of that matter,0.12325224
but this one really got to me for some reason,0.07891493
i don't know why,0.12699501
but i really like this one this movie creeped me out black and white silent movies always creeped me out,0.19845665
i don't know why it's just,0.112236835
they're so freaky this one especially this is a movie i think if you haven't seen it you all need to see because it just,0.31089434
it's such a great movie and you just don't need to see it horrifying or not go watch it the cabinet of dr,0.14195643
caligari is about a man named francis and um,0.12028994
this is actually one of the very first movies that has ever came out to have the the frame story effect where it's like um you've all seen movies where in the beginning there's like there'll be like two people talking or whatever and they'll say i'm gonna tell you a story,0.06323444
and then the whole movie ends up being that story the person is telling the other person to and at the very end,0.07795655
you know it goes back to them telling the story if that's what a frame story is,0.033832397
and this is one of the very first movies like to have that,0.05710661
and believe it or not this is one of the very first movies to ever come out with the twist ending and a very good one too i did not expect that twist any coming,0.06242624
and i guess i could say it's one of the greatest twist endings in cinema history,0.042332493
but yeah this film is about a man named francis and um,0.13377687
he's talking to this like guy next to him,0.29165226
and then like this lady in white just like kind of walks past them like looking very weird,0.4271962
i don't know,0.14657873
and then um,0.05796719
dr,0.050000302
francis tells the man he's talked into he tells them a story about the cabinet of dr,0.09109459
caligari or dr,0.055901747
caligari and um basically what happens is um what's his name francis,0.08221233
and alan are two they're kind of two friends who are both competing,0.058386043
each other to marry a woman named jane james or can't talk right,0.26864693

they're both gonna be friends,0.066054404
no matter what no matter who marries who but um basically the film takes place at this carnival where um there's a man in the name of dr,0.10150521
caligari basically he's like running this big event thing where he's telling people to come be a son ambulance which we know as today as a sleepwalker and that's just what they called him back then,0.12815955
but he's telling people to meet this sleepwalker who apparently is hypnotized and he's been awake for 23 years and that's how old he is,0.14672288
and um this somnambulist his name is caesar or as they would pronounce it probably back then cesar and um cesar he's again,0.13224877
he's like a sleepwalker,0.4938255
he's been asleep all his life and um you know at this main event,0.32298025
he's like a crowd of people,0.31099504
alan and um allen and francis are one of those people and basically dr,0.10284852
caligari keeps this man named cesar in a cabinet not let's not not necessarily a cabinet but like in this uh i want to see like kind of like a closet,0.24184829
i guess i don't know where he keeps them,0.111659124
he keeps him hidden,0.10696017
that's the point but and then he opens it up,0.051831085
and for the very first time cesar wakes up dr,0.06244861
caligari does like this weird thing where he makes him wake up,0.24010979
and he's woken up for the first time and um,0.06895184
he says to ask he tells the audience to ask cesar all these different questions,0.07410236
so um allen goes up to the sleepwalker and he tells him when will i die and basically cesar tells him you will die by tomorrow at dawn,0.6045219
and at that point i was like this just got a little interesting and then you know what happens is it shows allen sleeping at night,0.07564847
and then just like a shadowy figure slowly going up to him and killing him and stabbing him with the knife which is a very frightening scene by the way francis and jane get married the next day and um they soon find out that allen is uh murdered and um,0.7158846
they find out that this dr,0.08816537
caligari,0.03910246
and this man named cesar are up to something that isn't very good and that they're killing random people in this town and that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much sums up the story of the cabinet of dr,0.3244195
caligari,0.03910246
now the cabinet of dr,0.08293536
caligari is again a very very creepy movie um a lot better than i thought it was gonna be honestly,0.26512116
i really really like this movie a lot and um,0.11647351
yeah it really surprised me again that swiss standing was just fantastic i loved every second of this movie well some parts got a little slow here,0.25339052
and there because you know it's a silent film and you know it's just it gets very slow but the movie is actually only 71 minutes long or at least the version,0.10539006
i saw was 71 minutes long so it's definitely not very long you could easily like sit through the whole thing and watch it the film is very creepy,0.25654835
what makes it creepy is like just,0.15538073
there's no sound,0.0760434
it's just all very eerie music and there's just the whole thing is just music playing,0.069004714
and it's just so very eerie and it's kind of disturbing in a way that really makes the movie very good the movie has also this very strange and creepy atmosphere to it that not a lot of movies have nowadays and it's just very creepy,0.15151466
i don't know why,0.12699501
but for some reason the scene where um,0.07370182
i don't know what to call them caesar or cesar,0.15284187
i probably have been pronouncing,0.06526232
it wrong,0.09505881
