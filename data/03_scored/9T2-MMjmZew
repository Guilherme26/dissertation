hi everybody my name is mary on this channel i watch movies and series that,0.06830096
i've never seen before today i will be watching black panther for the very first,0.2436278
time let's go hi everybody welcome back to another marvel movie normally i go into,0.11113452
these movies blind i don't look up stuff up front but today i did because,0.24496119
i know that this movie is a very important cultural perspective and i wanted to,0.06117392
look into that a little bit more before i get into it so i like,0.23994611
really can notice that as well so today it's actually the first marvel movie that,0.052317325
has a black lead superhero it's also the first marvel movie with a black director,0.1074043
and mainly black cost and what i've read as well black women in powerful and,0.33984268
leading positions so honestly i think that that's super important to pay attention to and,0.07112879
not just like go over and act like that's not important because the fact that,0.09718938
it's only the first time this happens is quite late i would say but i,0.060315717
think it's super important because i feel like especially when i look at younger kids,0.105715625
it's important for them to have super heroes role models that they can identify with,0.04271507
they know that they can dream about being a superhero as well when it comes,0.09248914
to their race gender sexual preference and so forth it's only sad for a kid,0.47234827
if you look at superheroes and none of them look like you that's just heartbreaking,0.20096737
so i'm so glad that this is happening i think in the world that we,0.08184993
live in today it's more than important and that's why i also really appreciate this,0.05612935
movie i did read which is absolutely heartbreaking that chadwick boseman actually passed away it's,0.10016624
just so incredibly sad and i think it's especially it feels very weird going into,0.15312205
this movie know that he made this and put his foot in it got very,0.19196041
much appreciated for it and then sadly a disease took over so i want to,0.17833352
go in with a lot of respect for him in this movie i think that's,0.10210678
everything i have to say for it and we shall see how it goes i,0.08136397

still needs to prove that he's worthy the river thread will not challenge today does,0.10077998
that mean that they all respect him as a leader this corset is really uncomfortable,0.31431535
so could we all just wrap it up and go home i thought that was,0.09252344
going to be really wrong imagine being late and then want to challenge rude i,0.24412324
accept your challenge then i thought this was going to be like a nice moment,0.065121755

this happened a few times already what has happened to our gun there's no way,0.10850423
he died right there's no way i just oh i should have taken you back,0.5154597
long ago instead we are both abandoned here damn and the sad part is that,0.5578655
you still hear that today imagine as a kid that death around you is normal,0.4660486
that you're used to that so when it comes time for another king we will,0.07735666
be ready another king burn it all what dude this is not the way i,0.489351
think he is focused a lot on the part where he gets revenge and gets,0.24050933
to drone but not really much on how to actually deal with that once he,0.1093711
gets a drone we're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our war dogs so they,0.17307621
can finally rise up and kill those in power and their children and anyone else,0.8328306
who takes their side imagine if you say that we're going to kill them and,0.85934454
their children like are you even yeah i would not like to be in that,0.49068636
position either my son was married in ritual combat the new king is uh shut,0.31326672
up now one more word and i will feed you to my children kidding we,0.44690803

damn so he's only their best option come with me it's interesting that for them,0.7252239
it's an outsider but if you look at all the other tribes they seem to,0.09616473
be fine with it they seem to be like okay you won you have the,0.09871962
right impossible he's in a coma one of our fishermen found him at the edge,0.17218275
of the river border nakia the app oh but he's going to want the herb,0.06967318

you were wrong to abandon him i chose wakanda it's a kiddo and you are,0.3614963
wrong all of you are wrong to turn your backs on the rest of the,0.3915612
world no more i cannot stay here with you i must write these wrongs yes,0.23993321
let's go the black panther leaves look at this a handheld sonic cannon powerful enough,0.24036124

be so confusing for everybody involved like yeah but we but what uh we rather,0.06476016
review but he won but did he win but like [Applause] what i was gonna,0.06950367
like if i had to guess the kill this clown thing would really upset him,0.8407888
and be like i still grew up with this guy you are not fit to,0.4328901

i really thought for a second that he was going to get her these battles,0.14570989
are sick oh you can power it off but also his oh they came yes,0.40320018
it's actually incredibly sad thank god i have goosebumps hell of a move my pops,0.31422046
said wakanda was the most beautiful thing you ever seen i was thinking like they,0.11713212
probably can just save him as well it's beautiful maybe we can still heal you,0.07671275
so you can just lock me up just bury me in the ocean with my,0.5154597
ancestors that jumped from the ships they knew death was better than bondage oh i,0.49374634
thought you meant coachella for disneyland why here go chill out disneyland this is where,0.059084952
our father killed our uncle they're tearing it down we are not telling it now,0.31089434
i bought this building this will be the first walk on an international outreach center,0.08424079
you're kidding yeah yeah imagine these kids on the on the like once glory oh,0.2324024
man i love the ending this was such a strong movie in terms of like,0.080266684
you have that superhero element and again like the super cool look at my kids,0.08400855
so i was gonna say that it's such a strong movie in terms of like,0.05182751
still you have the marvel element and like the superhero and the combination of futuristic,0.07398445
very traditional elements which in my opinion is still awesome but then you also have,0.057538822
that strong message that's behind the movie and what i said before i really feel,0.10392116
like i did a good job how was this movie perceived when it came out,0.09224322
did it reach the goal i think it's also very strong of marvel to make,0.047399454
that decision to make it like this and the end with the little kid is,0.10739576
literally what i said at the beginning that he looks at a superhero and is,0.068817526
like who are you my name is king t'challa we will be sharing our knowledge,0.19151992
and resources with the outside world we must find a way to look after one,0.082262635
another what kind of nation do farmers have to offer the rest of the world,0.24033524
oh he knows oh nice it's actually strong as well he's like i don't need,0.13008595
to uh you you shall see mystery the music was also so good right that,0.09761003
modern with traditional again i love it good morning sergeant barnes bucky come much more,0.2059476
for you to learn oh wow i i need to like the last time we,0.1032351
saw him he went away with captain america right with the confrontation with iron man,0.146749
i think was the last time oh and the next one is infinity war yeah,0.098456115
i i love this movie and i think it sent such a strong message as,0.11134322
very strong today still years after and sadly will still be important for the next,0.050245438
years to come i think it's great that they did that of course i can,0.08002706
only speak for my own experience i like seeing strong female warriors and leading lady,0.17941011
in tech like all those things are like yes so i hope that this happened,0.04191049
and people from the black community felt the same from their representation so let me,0.37483057
know what you thought about this movie i think it's great i think it's great,0.13807566
that they worked on that implemented that in the sphere of a marvel superhero movie,0.039973184
and i am so excited for infinity war because my comments are filled with people,0.31089434
like counting down towards that movie so i'm like i don't know what to expect,0.1913099
but i guess it's gonna be great so i cannot wait to record that for,0.06662568
