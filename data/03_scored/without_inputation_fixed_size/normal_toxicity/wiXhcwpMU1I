Coco is Pixar's latest animated film and this one tells the story of young Miguel,0.07025544
a boy who really wants to be a musician he looks up to arnesto dela,0.26487342
Cruz the most famous musician he knows of he has a special attic hideaway dedicated,0.25233644
to this musician where he watches old VHS tapes of dela Cruz's performances he wants,0.26518047
so much to be a musician like him one day but his family would prefer,0.08873844
that he makes shoes for a living because that's what all of his relatives have,0.091526665
done music is pretty much banned in his family so one day he decides to,0.14907399
steal or nesto dela Cruz his guitar from his grave and in so doing finds,0.5829466
himself in the land of the dead there he must try to find his passed,0.21167018
away relatives to try to connect with them and figure out why exactly music is,0.082644254
viewed as a curse on his family and see if there's any way that he,0.4658377
can do what he wants to do with his life while still pleasing his family,0.24766992
I stayed away from most marketing materials with this film I had seen the first,0.049086314
teaser I think at a movie I was forced to watch it and I didn't,0.0726992
really know anything about the film so it was really nice to watch it unfold,0.06492233
and see this adventure blossom and be really surprised consistently by a very moving and,0.05809836
touching film Pixar is really known for making you cry and I would say for,0.3410069
myself for the majority of the movie I was just enjoying the experience the final,0.06015123
10 minutes though I heard people crying all around me in the theater I heard,0.19426034
people blowing their noses everyone was just really affected by the last 10 minutes of,0.3401951
this movie and it's because it takes its time to build up a credible story,0.06806846
with a family and a backstory and real history and actual pathos like you feel,0.31915674
like you are stepping into a big story that's already happened and few films are,0.109635435
able to accomplish that especially animated films a film that feels like it has history,0.05992445
like it happened before the movie started like these characters existed in this world before,0.07394047
the film began and that's one of the best things about Coco the music is,0.031559203
also wonderful the guitar work the singing it all sounds really beautiful these are things,0.14906536
you've come to expect with Pixar it's a cliche for me to say this movie,0.18040319
is gorgeously animated it is it's insanely detailed and there were specific shots of city,0.22664472
structure and streets and the cobblestone walkways that just looked photorealistic and if someone were,0.082691774
to tell me they actually are photorealistic and they just inserted animated characters into this,0.24762158
architecture I'd be like that makes sense because that's the level that Pixar is at,0.07785802
now computer animation has come so far it's mind-boggling now there was a film that,0.10690645
came out in 2014 called the book of life this film had similar themes we,0.04262536
had a young character whose family wanted him to be a bullfighter and he had,0.14839664
a passion for it and he was good at it but he also had other,0.14905857
things that he wanted to do with his life and he wasn't sure the path,0.056151383
he wanted to take and it was kind of about him bouncing what he wanted,0.11589454
to do with his life and love and it also revolved around the Day of,0.11126998
the Dead celebration and so some people have said hey Pixar you're ripping off the,0.3888736
book of life having actually seen both of the films I can say that the,0.076535836
stories are fairly different and I wouldn't say any ripping off or copying has occurred,0.10969956
it's just that they have similar themes and they both take place during the Day,0.053546313
of the Dead celebration and so inevitably they will be compared they've also come out,0.15220557
in a fairly short time span I feel like if you love the book of,0.05446527
life it's gonna be really hard to not think about that movie while watching Coco,0.10885052
if you were disappointed in that film though Coco might be that one where you,0.1133847
go okay there they got some things right this film is thematically rich it has,0.089721866
a lot of good surprises as well from a story standpoint it has characters that,0.0318918
I can see people especially young kids really appreciating it is however a little familiar,0.09242636
in its storytelling basically because it's another story about a young kid who wants to,0.059145782
do something with his life and his family wants them to do something else and,0.100984864
he has to find it within him to appreciate both sides and it's a good,0.08097673
message for kids but it did feel strikingly familiar at times especially since the book,0.05758752
of life came out three years ago that's really my biggest issue with Coco is,0.08076476
that as a story it's really beautiful and very touching but it didn't really wrap,0.08969078
me into it and I didn't feel all that invested in the characters despite the,0.04514349
fact that it's so well told and really beautifully directed it doesn't have as investing,0.08465849
a story as I would have liked because it does feel like other things we've,0.04986878
seen before but still this is a good movie and it's well done and the,0.07258503
music and the animation and the voice work is all really good I'm gonna give,0.1086974
Koko a B+ I hope you guys check this one out if you are looking,0.11013646
forward to it it's definitely worth your time it just is a little familiar and,0.0662348
it's storytelling we've seen these types of themes before beyond that it's it's definitely worth,0.075825855
checking out and I would see it in theaters guys thank you so much as,0.16918552
