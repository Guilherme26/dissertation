hey guys here's my review for the shape of water a film directed by Camila,0.12006877
del Toro a film that I was actually kind of very much looking forward to,0.06643708
because I still have a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth after,0.6712901
the crimson peak that was my attempt at sign language I looked it up I,0.05248235
apologized I couldn't find the translation for the book I am and so I apologize,0.063720085
to that but otherwise I actually really liked this movie del Toro was always known,0.06676187
for fantastically visual films he also is always known for very intriguing characters this film,0.11134028
is basically kind of like a quasi sequel but not really a more of an,0.2432749
Amash prequel to the character Beit sapien in the Hellboy movies as there is a,0.031908855
creature who is M phibian who can walk both on land and in water and,0.24146529
just so happens to like eggs but either way this film is actually very good,0.14576732
it does fall a little bit of stereotypes of Adele Toros previous works but the,0.050637554
thing I will also say is this is some of the best character writing he's,0.08132946
ever done Sally Hawkins is fantastic as a character the fact that she is a,0.12917006
mute does not hinder her at all in character development or expressing emotion it's one,0.08474975
of the things I've always loved about watching people who do ASL is that there's,0.07744292
no words physically our vocally being spoken but there's so much emotion that can be,0.05710087
conveyed just in how people move their hands and their faces how they express it,0.0668833
Richard Linklater who I originally thought was like gonna be her father or something in,0.14817302
this film he's not he's actually a completely very unique character the film takes place,0.09783993
in the 50s and his character is a quite an interesting sort of situation as,0.029073104
he is a closeted gay who wears the toupee and he's an artist and what,0.58454275
is so interesting about this movie is that there are instances of racial profiling or,0.15267989
just racism with Octavia Spencer's character and other people as well as there is obviously,0.31089434
the homophobia towards Richard Linklater's character and the thing that I liked about it is,0.35411
it wasn't there more so as a statement but it's just how the characters are,0.056371517
written and I like that so much it's because I understand when political statements are,0.059919655
being said but Deltora wasn't really trying to say that he's just giving us really,0.18239197
good characters and of course Michael Shannon wins the award for creepy nlgger of the,0.35732552
year again holy nlgger he is so creepy in this movie but he's so intriguing,0.44770426
his dialogue is full of such bigotry but you can't help but be someone interested,0.4154861
in how he's going to handle things because the man just does not want to,0.11773639
quit and as the films moving towards this conclusion you can't really help but think,0.11320117
he's committed that's for sure really he's a fantastic antagonist in this film just his,0.1400172
interactions with Sally Hawkins and the rest of the cast it's just so unnerving he,0.2321071
is absolutely horrifying it's like if Buffalo Bill got to be the head of security,0.31089434
but he wasn't a murder at least you knew about it anyways but there are,0.147528
certain scenes that are incredibly disturbing and very uncomfortable but some of the best ones,0.10559771
in terms of just character development as well is just like wow I can't believe,0.07054329
they did that speaking of which the opening of this movie I admit my eyebrows,0.15403475
were raised because we see how Sally Hawkins go through her normal routine and then,0.11703885
she goes into the bathtub and has a little bit of her time and they,0.2416504
just kind of nonchalantly go over that and is their routine they repeat it again,0.084545456
later it's like oh okay that's another thing I like about what del Toro does,0.115451984
of this movies he doesn't care about this stuff he just like shows it like,0.15502527
it's a regular day and I thought that was great again not forced it's just,0.097735524
there and again that's why I like these characters so much they feel real they,0.043421634
don't feel like stereotypes they don't feel like people who are there for us a,0.08720284
message or a statement they are just very well-written but the creature is pretty cool,0.11437867
too the relationship between him and Sally Hawkins is very endearing if not just a,0.121050276
little bit weird but it's really cool to watch two people come together in a,0.44419044
way that they can only express through themselves the music is fantastic Alexandra do pasta,0.089167506
five saying that correctly does a fantastic job with the soundtrack there's also a lot,0.05820719
of classic songs from the 40s and 50s that I played which is just fantastic,0.07544656
del Toro basically makes a love letter to the 50s with this movie but he,0.07485262
does slightly veer into kind of the stereotype of del Toro's writing mainly the last,0.061283447
20 minutes I was able to basically call play-by-play while his movies are dark and,0.11032507
always kind of have a sad but slightly happy ending I still enjoyed it I,0.1395176
think it is definitely one of his best movies that he's ever done and it's,0.09592429
a film that should be watched it's pretty ballsy for some of the stuff that,0.1310841
it just not gelatin ligo's over so I enjoy that I appreciate that and I'm,0.079706095
I've been I feel a lot better now I was really kind of little about,0.056889545
crimson peak because that movie sucked in my opinion but this was much more enjoyable,0.64553976
this was very engaging the characters some of the best characters I've seen in film,0.04702059
in a long time Richard Linklater kills it sally hawkins kills it Michael Shannon kills,0.6350361
it almost literally and I just really enjoyed this movie so in the end I'm,0.06972458
gonna give the shape of water is six out of seven it's definitely one of,0.05943981
the best movies of the year I can't believe that both Molly's game and shape,0.03924734
