hello Kyle mark Walter here for another film bite review got new haircut new haircut new,0.17201461
you knew you knew do do people say that is that it's not,0.105154864
it's not a thing anyways,0.091705255
I'm taking a look today at beau Burnham's 2018 feature directorial debut 8th grade oh now 8th grade is a film that's kind of hard to summarize because it's really about the network of things that go on in the film essentially though the movie follows Kayla day in her final week up eighth grade,0.069103576
she has a YouTube channel with not very many viewers a single dad,0.28267577
and the film follows her as she struggles with different things in her life at the end of her eighth grade year her desire to have friends her desire to feel accepted and her desire to be seen as something more valuable than she is at her middle school she is pegged as the silent loner type but really has dreams of being something more such a quick plot synopsis really doesn't do,0.06589824
this justice it might make you just kind of roll your eyes and go okay well not another melodramatic coming-of-age film but this movie is anything but that it is a really impressive directorial debut from Bo Burnham,0.12667899
it's kind of a set of wandering episodes or experiences across Kayla's final week of middle school and as you watch these episodes unfold it really develops her into a complex individual you really empathize and feel for her fears and her concerns and the things that she is going through,0.06773623
she's incredibly easy to empathize with the situations that Burnham has written into the film into the screenplay are really incredible,0.06764438
and the writing is really spot-on,0.06697636
the actors are given some incredible moments to work with and that transform this film into something of a rather sublime dramedy about the trials and tribulations of growing up in the 21st century technology plays a big part of this film kayla has a YouTube channel and across the film we see how internet and online communication is becoming and has become a really important and meaningful part of communication to a lot of people growing up right now,0.045621756
and how the Internet is an important part of the maturation experience and how that impacts the relationships that people have,0.08957346
and the fears that people have growing up with the internet right at their hands but outside of that the situations that Burnham has brought into this film are really really poignant the relationship between Kayla and her father the relay ship between Kayla and some high schoolers that she meets are incredibly well developed and give us these wonderful glimpses at the difficulty of relationships and the fears that come out of relationships that work or don't work,0.06747558
when you're in middle school going into high school,0.116444215
and the acting is brilliant LLC Fischer who plays Kayla is phenomenal,0.0981078
and Burnham has done a great job choosing a young actress who is not recognizable who can jump into this role as this,0.11965768
eighth grader who is is feeling insecure and unsure of herself and looking for ways to grow into this world Josh Hamilton as the father is wonderful,0.19784284
and even the small supporting characters should get a shout out Jake Ryan another young actor who plays the sort of awkward lovable boy who comes into Kayla's life at different times is absolutely phenomenal and just crushes this role as the easily overlooked awkward boy who's around this girl's life you would you like chicken overs right,0.24703696
yeah,0.040847696
okay cool,0.05487404
I got a 20 piece and I also got two of every kind of sauce,0.088565566
but you know if you have a favorite sauce,0.06710538
and one packet of it you can have mine I like all the sauces equally Thanks,0.05645641
yeah oh and the Nuggets have been sitting out for a little bit because you know I didn't know when he'd be here so just uh you know tell me if they're too cold,0.14915548
and I can heat them up in the microwave from there okay okay,0.2183389
and the directing is really solid,0.041119173
it's not spectacular in terms of catching your attention,0.11609835
but does exactly what it needs to,0.05007709
and Burnham has worked with his camera and his scimitars to do a really great job of capturing with such simple photography such poignant and powerful moments,0.076109484
I would give the film four out of five bites,0.14058182
it is nuanced,0.0549166
it's poignant,0.05028013
it's a powerful coming-of-age story that is really refreshing to see in a time where we are seeing a lot more coming-of-age stories appear or at least at a higher frequency,0.052913025
and this one really rises above the others in terms of its ability to tell us some interesting stories with some powerful screenwriting and some powerful acting I highly recommend eighth grade,0.055698115
