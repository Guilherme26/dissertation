[Music] last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again this is the opening line of Rebecca the 1940 Academy award-winning film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted from a novel of the same name the film which can be classified as a romantic drama or thriller follows the life of Maxim de Winter in his new bride who has never named other than to be called mrs. de Wynter however more importantly the film follows the mysterious death of Maxim's previous wife Rebecca and the manner in which every other character especially Danvers the head housekeeper and previously close confidant of Rebecca seems to hold some sort of obsession with her aspects of the film such as the meson sin camera angle and non-diegetic sounds helped to establish this obsession and create the film's ominous mood [Music] one aspect of the Nissan sin that contributes to these ideas throughout the film is the reoccurring images of water throughout the film depictions of the sea and raging waves are shown at times these images are accompanied by maksim or mrs. Dewinter and often evoke a feeling of danger for example after revealing her costume to Maxim mrs. Dewinter looks over the sea with Danvers in Rebecca's room in this scene there is an overarching feeling of Rebecca's presence in the waves redolent of Rebecca's brutal death the dress she previously wore the room and in danvers words urging mrs. Dewinter to jump you've nothing to stay for you have nothing to live for really have you look down there it's easy isn't it I don't you this scene highlights Rebecca's impact and shows the many ways in which her influence is still alive another effective tool for creating the film's ominous mood and underlining Rebecca's impact is the camera angle and in this case medium close-ups the employment of medium close-ups throughout the film served to accentuate each character's emotions and in turn accentuate how powerful Rebecca's presence was and still is this idea is most apparent in the scene where Danvers shows mrs. Dewinter Rebecca's room and personal belongings which have been kept exactly as she left them as Danvers shows mrs. Dewinter Rebecca's belongings and describes life serving Rebecca close-ups are used on your sister winter this shows mrs. de winters fear of Rebecca's remaining control and unease over the extent of Danvers obsession with Rebecca I wonder if she doesn't come back here to Manderley watch you and mr. de winter together you look good why don't you stay here awhile and read in addition this scene reveals the extent of Danvers devotion to an obsession with Rebecca as it is shown how she held and still holds Rebecca in such reverence and maintains her room in all of Manderley - Rebecca standards even after her death furthermore one of the most effective means of producing this mood and emphasizing the force of Rebecca is the use of non-diegetic sound in the form of music and nearly every scene the tone created by the nissan son and camera angle is stressed by the music this is evident in the scene where Maxim de Winter drives his new bride mrs. de Wynter to his home Manderley in this scene the background music changes from an upbeat jaunty tune as we see the newlyweds drive up to their home to something more menacing as mrs. de winter is introduced to danvers for the first time I didn't expect the whole stops to be intended mr. dancers other side sorry about this one taken this is mrs. Danville how do you do how do you do I have everything in readiness for you that's very good of you I didn't expect anything I think we'd like some teeth come along darling [Music] this scene highlights the shift from life away from Manderley where the couple met free from Rebecca's influence to life at Manderley where Rebecca's power is alive still in the house danvers obsession and the see the meson sin use of medium close-ups and non-diegetic sounds create the film's Menasha stone and impress the extent of Rebecca's influence even after death these techniques emphasize the idea that Rebecca will always be alive in spirit and memory at least at Manderley and lead to the only logical ending for Maxim de Winter and mrs. de winter to be able to go on together the burning down of Mandalay and Danvers along with it this leaves the newlyweds with nothing but memories of Manderley free at last of the control of Rebecca [Music]
