either guys how are you so I feel like I'm the last person on the,0.083787136
internet to see this movie Logan is the third standalone Wolverine movie does anyone remember,0.08455744
that abomination against humanity you probably don't want to remember it because if you do,0.17093419
it'll give you nightmares and some people like that movie and that's okay but I,0.31089434
think it's a big bloated pile of nlgger and it almost ruined the entire franchise,0.5876557
of overeating well we got this movie so it makes up for no with that,0.08132857
said check out my awesome new Wolverine t-shirt these are located at mighty public store,0.1490404
I'll put the link down below I have like nine new Wolverine t-shirts I picked,0.24187757
up it just felt necessary and to be honest with you I actually couldn't decide,0.09156028
which Wolverine t-shirt to wear for this movie review watch this old clip from 2013,0.14834376
where I kill x-men origins Wolverine and I'm going to go switch my t-shirt I'll,0.8060606
be right back I think I like this one a little bit more alright so,0.08569066
Logan is directed by James Mangold who also directed the second Wolverine movie titled the,0.035543695
Wolverine and as far as that movie goes I don't think it's a bad movie,0.16690521
it's slightly entertaining but it's just a very forgettable movie in the Wolverine franchise because,0.06365663
by the third act of silver samurai turns into a Decepticon and nlgger you're just,0.5672383
like what's happening now let's talk about the movie Logan this film is based on,0.1012006
the old man Logan comics and it takes place in the near future where everything,0.13212876
in this universe has went downhill and by the way just on a quick nerdy,0.37890095
side note why can't they just give Wolverine his suit for one movie they almost,0.14162779
did it in the last movie almost and it's like I get it you can't,0.08146228
have Hugh Jackman running around and yellow spandex but and this will be Logan Wolverine,0.06410007
is old he's grizzled he's beaten down he's tired he doesn't want to do this,0.2950258
anymore because now when he gets shot or stabbed he doesn't heal instantaneously he's more,0.5154597
vulnerable he can't really take a beating like he used to I mean he still,0.32416013
has adamantium claws that can heal eventually but there's a larger sense of danger there,0.052218158
when he's in these situations and it puts you on the edge of your seat,0.11364482
a little bit more so yeah let me get this out of the way before,0.24587576
we continue on if I was writing the script for this movie I would have,0.06495889
made part of the script or maybe a plot point to where since he healing,0.070944525
slower maybe he does have to get a suit of armor somehow some way to,0.060998075
go into the final climax of the movie in that suit of armor might look,0.08147241
something like this I don't know I just get Wolverine of yellow spandex I want,0.35261852
it all right let's get back to the plot of the movie but by the,0.08276099
way if you guys agree with me let me know down below in the comment,0.24846622
section and as far as the overall vibe of this movie goes and has a,0.06655572
very post-apocalyptic western vibe and I loved it I just love the way that this,0.113362946
movie looked and the way that it felt with the scenery and the settings in,0.0401486
this film had a very immersive vibe to it but now let's talk about Charles,0.10680597
Xavier played by Patrick Stewart and in this film Charles Xavier is not doing too,0.0627287
well he's suffering from a mental illness where it confuses him and sometimes when you,0.5876557
combine that with his mutant powers where he uses his mind it's a disaster waiting,0.32698393
to happen and that whole aspect plays a very large part in this movie and,0.087746315
I really enjoyed that because everything is very unstable at times and there's a few,0.1007461
really intense situations where Wolverine is the only guy who can step in and save,0.11904185
the day now the best way I can describe Logan this is a comic book,0.10253929
movie for people who don't like comic book movies now don't get me wrong I,0.18945442
love comic book movies can you tell look at all that nlgger back there but,0.4467698
more often than not comic book movies are over produced they're over budgeted they're over,0.06805254
scripted they're just a big bloated CGI mess of just random explosions and nlgger just,0.53490317
happening for the sake of happening this movie at times almost feels like an independent,0.0872442
action movie with great character moments but it just so happens to feature the character,0.05320846
of Wolverine and that's the biggest praise I can give this movie it feels like,0.09531187
a real movie and not just a comic book movie I'll be honest with you,0.1509272
going into this movie that was my fear because I almost thought it might be,0.15495172
underwhelming and not quite give me that comic-book aspect of that epicness and those berserker,0.40212402
attacks I was looking for but I am happy to say the Wolverine fanboy inside,0.16561621
of me was very happy five minutes into this movie because you realize they are,0.21777472
definitely utilizing that rated R rating and they're giving you the Wolverine we've all been,0.07961476
waiting 17 years to see isn't crazy hugh jackman has been this character for 17,0.31089434
years and I think with Logan this is probably the best portrayal of the character,0.034589056
we've seen yet and most importantly we get those hardcore rated or Berserker attack scenes,0.15159492
we've all wanted to see that's right 78 people get decapitated in this nlgger movie,0.47137946
with adamantium claws from a storytelling standpoint everything that happens in this movie with the,0.0985395
action and the blood the guts from the gore and the violence it all blends,0.4286907
together so well and in between all those things you have characters and you understand,0.061625786
these characters so when they're in these intense situations you actually care about what's happening,0.076872066
to them and out of all the x-men movies I would say this movie have,0.24026659
some of the best character moments and there's a few very sad dramatic scenes between,0.10427922
Charles Xavier and Logan to this movie and the chemistry between these two guys it's,0.0780374
great now let's talk about the little badass who does berserker attacks in the movie,0.39412272
and her character's name is Laura but this little girl was awesome she was well-written,0.15474387
and there are scenes where she kicks a lot of ass and it gets like,0.931399
just a little girl dangling on wires of special effects helping her do these things,0.3052772
and as far as movies go the best thing I could do to compare to,0.06554432
her character in the movie Logan is she's almost like Hit Girl from the kick-ass,0.8160851
movies she still does a lot of the scenes in the movie so yeah I,0.117937356
really liked the character of Laura in this movie now with all that said I,0.05173754
do have a few complaints with the movie now this we does have a few,0.040947694
antagonists that go up against Wolverine because we'll really need somebody to fight and I,0.1804049
thought for the most part as far as the storytelling standpoint goes they were sufficient,0.0609796
they did their job but I also thought they were both very bland and one,0.16019961
of the antagonists in this film almost feel like it was just tossed in there,0.07506549
because hey we need another badass for Wolverine to fight so let's just do this,0.49552247
now does that mean it's bad no I really enjoyed their final showdown in the,0.08584854
movie I really thought it was well done and awesome to watch but I sort,0.06609312
of wanted something else and one other thing I didn't necessarily love about this movie,0.04974973
is during the third act of the movie the big climax is happening things are,0.09474341
going down the action is ramping up I got to score that was backing all,0.07600051
this up wasn't very good when it comes to musical film scores I think they,0.07852987
can really intensify the action that happening up on the screen and during the third,0.040701248
act of this movie or people or running around in the woods it almost felt,0.13990524
discombobulating it just feel like random noises happening and it didn't really build up the,0.06722146
situation as much as I wanted it to you take other movies like Batman Begins,0.08747971
of the Dark Knight you hear that Hans Zimmer score and it builds up and,0.06340186
it escalates the sequence and amazing scores like that almost give you a little goosebumps,0.2830369
down your arm you guys know I'm talking about but during the third act of,0.24780463
this movie that score that they play it just didn't really do anything for anything,0.10882362
happening up on the screen I thought it almost took it down a notch so,0.076331876
now here are my final nlgger thoughts on Logan first things first I think we,0.15502225
got by saying Deadpool because it took a chance and it was one of the,0.054639958
best rated our comic-book movies that made a lot of money because of the success,0.07466789
of Deadpool Fox Studios said wow we can put our head down of our asses,0.88824683
and actually make movies that go for and aren't watered down because as far as,0.10138425
comic-book movies go there are just some stories that need to be rated R to,0.07498016
give the viewing audience the best possible movie they can and once again I love,0.033000655
Deadpool it's rated R it was awesome it was a blast to watch but when,0.07562341
it comes to films movies like Logan evoke emotions out of me they made me,0.1275996
feel something they make me feel sympathy or a feeling of sadness and other times,0.108111076
when Wolverines getting beat to nlgger and he's down on his knees and he's about,0.6364068
to give up that one little ounce of energy fire is up inside of him,0.13834862
and his claws come out he kicks everyone's ass and I love moments like that,0.9480856
so a movies that evoke emotion out of me are just my preference for movies,0.06989973
and that right there is why I think Logan is probably the best rated our,0.01890124
comic book movie ever made so I'm going to give logan hara a solid a,0.1527274
this isn't a perfect movie it has flaws there was room for improvement but after,0.06945907
watching the movie i wanted to watch it again and very a few movies do,0.08644761
that for me the movie Logan definitely goes for it at times and I respect,0.06831101
things like that so that's my take on the movie Logan guys now here's my,0.11102873
question to you and let me know down below what you guys think about the,0.15324223
movie Logan or what is your favorite rated or comic-book movie of all time I,0.08802387
