that you go follow him on Twitter and Instagram because his work is absolutely amazing,0.031826377
so getting into Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler and I absolutely loved this film,0.07380479
I was shocked that I love this one because I actually got scared before I,0.043280173
went to go see it because when the embargo lifted and all the reviews came,0.012947135
out I was like yeah like I know this movie's gonna be great but I,0.037019465
felt like it was a little bit over height and I was scared because my,0.086797155
level of excitement was even higher because of how good the reviews were so I,0.017955301
didn't want to feel like I was setting myself up for failure if the reviews,0.026205575
completely overhyped the film but I will have to tell you that the movie is,0.02106437
very very good it definitely is a different type of Marvel film than what you're,0.044255998
used to seeing and I actually appreciate that now first and foremost the casting for,0.018776804
this film is simply amazing the casting for this film is so good and the,0.034610834
character development of the majority of the cast is so amazing that sometimes you forget,0.032851424
that there's a movie is about to chawla okay because you have all these different,0.037212368
story arcs from the other characters and they're just as entertaining to watch on the,0.017890114
screen that you kind of forget like oh yeah like I'm in a Black Panther,0.14882885
movie so I thought the casting decisions were absolutely amazing for this film now I,0.042274415
have to talk about the female presence of this movie and it's for a different,0.07305712
reason now a lot of people talked about the door of menagerie and they're basically,0.030756095
in this badass all-female army that protects the king but I really want to talk,0.37457243
about the diversity of female empowerment from the different types of characters because not only,0.09107162
do you have the general of the dorm Elisha who is this badass woman she,0.33204767
was one of my favorite characters to watching the action sequences but you also have,0.010954909
someone like Nakia who is kind of like an independent rebel who fights for her,0.09330531
country just in a different way than what you see the dorm lij I'm do,0.057022203
and then you have two childless little sisters sharee who is definitely gonna be the,0.03220021
fan favorite she was my favorite in the entire movie not only is she absolutely,0.060926165
hilarious in the film but she's a 16 year old genius not only is she,0.08751888
a 16 year old genius she isn't the smartest person on the planet yes she,0.10212964
is smarter than Toni start and she is responsible for the some of the technological,0.051254395
advances that what kind of continues to have so I really like the different types,0.033409514
of female characters that you see it was really refreshing not only just to get,0.051214483
the strong warrior-type but to get the highly intelligent woman as well or the independent,0.07887415
kind of spy type of female so I really appreciated that and especially as a,0.15956558
black woman seeing all these different types of black women who were basically just as,0.09950948
important to the film as Black Panther himself it was really great to see now,0.046252213
we have talked about this villain okay because when y'all started talk about this villain,0.09161907
y'all were like this is the best villain that I've ever seen that was just,0.055669885
like okay yeah it's not like it was gonna be that hard to do that,0.08914193
because the villains are and issue in these types of films but I absolutely enjoy,0.051414706
Michael B Jordan and yes I said Michael B Jordan because he was looking like,0.04001279
a little snack okay after you didn't lost ten pounds and you want to reward,0.06310664
your suffer at that cheat meal that was Michael Bay Jordan this kill monger okay,0.560118
yes he was getting it in a movie but back to him being a good,0.059843246
villain I enjoy kill monger now a lot of people compare him to Loki saying,0.73707676
the best villain says Loki but for me I'm gonna compare him closer to a,0.08391558
vulture just because I feel as though would both of their storylines I felt as,0.040252257
though because of their circumstances of what happened to them you kind of sympathize with,0.04238151
them as a character and then you almost felt like well yo given given the,0.016954865
same circumstances that she went through I would too and I was okay with that,0.055592723
and will kill monger is even is his circumstances are hiding to where not only,0.3725021
do you sympathize for his character but because he was speaking so much truth in,0.027935717
this film like he will be talking I'd be like yep message okay cuz he,0.08636412
didn't tell no lies he told that one lie in this film and it was,0.061454322
hard because you know that this is a hero film but it's kind of just,0.022847727
like I was okay either way I was like if if the hero wins I'm,0.049494985
okay but if the villain lives I'm a little too because he was speaking of,0.06946646
truth and so I think that's why a lot of people enjoyed his character because,0.026842821
he had character development and because the backstory of how his life turned into that,0.027939709
direction I think it really set him up to be a very good villain but,0.08143378
he was also funny too he was funny yeah like he was saved me he,0.032485574
would be serious but it would be funny and that kind of leads me to,0.04686285
another thing that I liked about this film the jokes the movie was funny at,0.054716676
the right times and I think as a black person because I felt as though,0.2986985
it was like black jokes it was junk so like black people will get cuz,0.71076006
it's like something that a black person will predominantly say to another black person which,0.57598376
made it even more hilarious and that's not to say that if you're not black,0.37873462
that you're not gonna get the jokes you're definitely gonna get and they're gonna be,0.03622058
funny whoever watches it but I just think it's a black person just given the,0.42596886
context of the jokes it made it even funnier even made it even more funny,0.04705709
for me so I thought that the movie knew when to take yourself seriously in,0.06379045
a new one to lighten up the mood but it wasn't in a cheesy way,0.03021131
it's so natural and because the movie felt so natural it didn't feel like a,0.017987896
superhero movie and I think that's because of the real-life topics that they talked about,0.056161456
they definitely talked about imperialism colonialism they talked about immigration this is there's this battle,0.035989095
of what do you do intervene with another country to try to you know help,0.043895468
them do better you know and I feel like a lot of the issues that,0.021333104
were talking about are relatable to the issues that we talked about as a country,0.014991909
today and I appreciate it that they did not try to like sugarcoat it they,0.027273195
called it what it was it wasn't preachy preachy it was done just right and,0.022795843
I appreciate it being so real which made it such a relatable film it's like,0.0629297
they it's a superhero film but it's not doesn't feel that way I definitely agree,0.035163604
with the comparisons that this is a Bond film made like the political thriller yes,0.024757471
now as much as I love this movie there were a few just a few,0.050533336
issues now a lot of people talk about the CG with the extra scenes I,0.03155897
didn't have an issue with majority of the action scenes I only had an issue,0.023327325
with the one with the two Panthers and I didn't like the music that was,0.022485867
paired with it that's really nitpicking it really wasn't necessary to say but that was,0.020964593
an issue for me as well as a little bit of the pasty some of,0.043110553
the parts of the beginning felt a little bit like too long but overall as,0.05073755
a film pacing wise I didn't feel like I was in a two hour and,0.014918739
14 minutes which was a good thing I just felt like there were a couple,0.07770742
of parts in the beginning that they didn't need to dwell on as much but,0.02001205
for me I love this movie I really love this movie I love that this,0.053107597
movie is dispelling the myths that are predominantly black cast with positive black characters can't,0.011304131
do well in the box office and we see that from what it's doing with,0.018893877
the presale tickets I love is of the beautiful presence of like women like doing,0.20748807
the damn thing and in a positive way I just love this movie so much,0.41994256
I'm so happy they were continued this is not just the first black superhero film,0.06213946
it's the first predominantly black cast with a Marvel movie but we had movies like,0.06915848
companies like Blankman we had meteor man we had spawn we had blade like we,0.22651006
had a lot of movies but I love that this movie is getting so much,0.024815341
height that we can continue to make other movies like this and even continue it,0.029026618
out into different genres I love this film I'm so happy that I got to,0.06481483
see this early I can't wait to go see it again on Monday and give,0.035392426
you a more in-depth look on my thoughts about this film but I'm gonna leave,0.086766556
