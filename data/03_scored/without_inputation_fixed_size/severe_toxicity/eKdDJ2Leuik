movie here and for this installment it's The Godfather I was really really excited to,0.034007512

out on my social media accounts I'm just trying to grow and build my community,0.03607956
every day I'm working really hard to not only work on my blog but my,0.035887986
youtube channel as well so if you could hit that subscribe button I would really,0.22133388
appreciate it now on with the review the godfather was directed by Francis Ford Coppola,0.03765272
and came out in 1972 as it stars Marlon Brando Al Pacino Robert Duvall James,0.051672798
Caan Diane Keaton as it headlines a star-studded cast for what is an incredible movie,0.042262442
there's a reason why this is a classic and I think we're gonna get into,0.0356585
it but it is just so well done and Francis Ford Coppola Bravo to you,0.055708464
sir because this movie is a hit and I can totally understand why now the,0.057293598
film follows the Corleone family was part of the Italian mafia in the 1940s in,0.12784497
New York and the power struggle that goes on with the other families in the,0.017749095
Mafia during this time period is very prevalent and a big part of this film,0.06302282
but also the characters that really stand out in the family specifically have to be,0.022940189
Vito played by Marlon Brando and Michael played by Al Pacino their characters are integral,0.012941813
to the main plot of the story as they're highly involved together but it's interesting,0.034351412
because since Michael was involved in world war two he comes back and is not,0.055761013
really a part of the family business and was kind of not dealt in on,0.018694986
things but since he is Beto's favorite son Vienna really wants him to have the,0.035145644
business and really run things but Michael really isn't into it at the start really,0.018239336
important quote that Michael says in the beginning of the film it's during the wedding,0.017683242
scene he's talking to Kay in case asking him are you a part of this,0.04571009
do you know what's going on and he says that's my family kay it's not,0.027335057
me this is the important one this is the one that shows that's where Michael,0.028773183
is in the beginning and then his transformation to the end of the film is,0.018425588
really the most intriguing part I saw a movie a couple weeks ago Goodfellas which,0.022571677
was a great movie the mob boss is the guy that you should be feared,0.14876899
he should really respect him and you know he's the guy who gets stuff done,0.05830667
and that I just felt like he was doing his thing he's grilling sausages and,0.16922139
just kind of they're in this one Brando really has that figure and that aura,0.034415938
about him that just commands respect and commands attention because every time he has a,0.029705105
scene you pay attention and you know better because if you don't then you're in,0.02517454
trouble I think it's interesting to kind of show that even though he has so,0.059833933
much power and even though he's done so much he's kind of off his game,0.04973977
he's kind of at the tail end at his career and that's a turning point,0.061525498
for a lot of families that are in the Mafia at that time and they,0.042044926
kind of want him gone so they try and do anything that they can to,0.05180517
take him out and try and supersede his power the Corleone family they're not gonna,0.108649105
let that happen they're gonna try and do the best they can to preserve that,0.020518254
power and Sonny the oldest son played by James Caan it was most notably also,0.037428554
in ELF playing Will Ferrell's dad does everything he can to try and preserve the,0.028033499
family business he's kind of like a wild card maverick sort of type deal he'll,0.07192098
kind of do what he wants and on impulse but he kind of won't think,0.08477367
things through and that's I think where Vito saw Michael was a little more rational,0.02963127
and can kind of do things by thinking them through instead of just kind of,0.03508777
like oh this happened I better retaliate and I think that's what makes Michael's characters,0.029002007
so engaging and so relatable is that in the beginning he's kind of like oh,0.022225115
I'm not involved in this like I shouldn't be he's just enjoying himself with Kay,0.06456073
and he's you know living his life but as soon as certain events happen Michael,0.07735753
starts to really change and I think that that turning point is the scene in,0.024565233
the restaurant where he deals with so the other head of the Italian mafia family,0.28437662
and the chief of police michael has a choice to make and ultimately that choice,0.039190624
is what changes his character for the rest of the film this movie is really,0.01658436
paced well and for it being almost a three-hour film for that to happen is,0.03369554
a pretty extraordinary feat and it's really a tale of two halves you have the,0.047821384
first half where Vito's character is in control and then the second half after he's,0.016340902
attempted on by the selasa family it's Michael's time to shine and I think that,0.042847138
that's really well done in a sense of showing how they're different but also it's,0.019668816
very similar and I think that's why Beto liked him so much because he was,0.04092875
so much like Michael was so much like him and the ending is just great,0.06315453
because it sets up that line that I mentioned earlier in the beginning it shows,0.028843028
how Michael has come full circle from kind of going to I'm not involved That's,0.015530707
not me k2 I'm in this this is my life now I've accepted the family,0.046825603
I've accepted the family business and Kay asked him to tell him the truth and,0.014727831
he straight-up lies to her and that not only sets up more tension down the,0.20856833
road but it also builds for another installment which we will get into next time,0.05810712
as I want to be a part 2 of The Godfather but overall as a,0.019501854
score I'm gonna get the Godfather a four point eight out of five that's the,0.024422217
highest rated score I've given a movie so it's a pretty good accomplishment to the,0.02835811
Godfather thank you all so much for watching it really means a lot to me,0.031307533
