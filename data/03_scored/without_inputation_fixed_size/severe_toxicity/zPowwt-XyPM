be a criterium blu-ray I'm not sure when I see The Criterion films come out,0.057859004
on another from another company on blu-ray it makes me wonder if it's ever gonna,0.031996664
come out on their version of blu-ray so this movie was the only film that,0.055280752
of Hitchcock's that was ever nominated or there was ever won Best Picture I've won,0.022103388
the net for 1940 it was nominated for 11 Academy Awards but only one to,0.03035233
one for black-and-white cinematography and one for outstanding production which is basically Best Picture and,0.005187767
Hitchcock was nominated for a for Best Director but he didn't win he's he was,0.012417648
nominated several times but he actually never won for Best Director he was given an,0.01260523
honorary award later on in life it's said that he wasn't able to win because,0.06326163
he's definitely one of the best of all time and another thing about Rebecca is,0.008983971
this was his first American film before this everything he did was a British film,0.009866004
so this was kind of a landmark film in a lot of different ways but,0.029744351
it starts Joan Fontaine as the young woman or the young lady they don't actually,0.08910135
ever say her name in the movie it also stars Laurence Olivier and he plays,0.020709163
max to winter hopefully or Maxim de winter I can't remember it's been a few,0.030981593
months since I watched it but I've watched this like so many times and what,0.020743752
happens is you know the stories the movies called Rebecca the Rebecca is the name,0.012997689
of his wife who had passed away and he's and I think Monte Carlo and,0.09719996
he meets this young woman who was working as a hired companion for this rich,0.06856713
annoying woman and they fall in love and end up getting married like two weeks,0.39915735
after they meet and she moves back to Mandalay which is the house that he's,0.029670516
lived in his whole life it's this huge estate and the the house itself is,0.046639353
like another character in the film it's really hard to describe but it's it's amazing,0.019712718
and there is a woman who was kind of running things in the house and,0.13248396
she was like Rebecca's personal maid back when she was alive and her name is,0.034266934
mrs danvers' and she's kind of this sinister figure who really doesn't accept the new,0.17329763
wife and was completely obsessed with Rebecca like she was almost to the point where,0.037812363
she was in love with her and she tries to kind of ruin things for,0.21320267
the new verge on Fontaine's character throughout the movie she's constantly setting her up for,0.034794427
failure and making her feel horrible even at one point almost pushing her to the,0.11942042
edge of suicide but the film is just amazing and there's a huge mystery to,0.17984371
it at the end but I don't want to even tell you about that part,0.028247023
because it's kind of a really crazy twist in the story and it's great and,0.05281292
I want you guys to experience it for the first time without any first-hand knowledge,0.14256415
I think I may have given away a bit too much information in my last,0.059292473
reveal cabinet of dr. Caligari I didn't realize one of the things I said maybe,0.020218257
some of you who haven't seen the film it might have gone over your head,0.066272244
and hopefully it did so that you didn't catch on but I kind of gave,0.054501157
away one of the twists so I'm sorry about that if I ruined that for,0.05584483
you but anyways Rebecca amazing and like I said Joan Fontaine one of my favorite,0.051746633
actresses of all time she was nominated for Best Actress but didn't win in this,0.0111411605
one and the following year 1941 she starred in suspicion which is actually one of,0.012806116
the first Hitchcock movies I ever saw and I love that one as well and,0.060136594
she did win Best Actress for that yeah so Hitchcock has done some amazing films,0.064838775
and it was hard it's hard to choose one of these to review because there's,0.04675975
a lot of different like amazing great movies there's at least three of them of,0.0334461
his films are in my top ten including this so I just went with this,0.062295113
