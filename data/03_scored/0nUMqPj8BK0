hello everybody I'm Tiffany and today I am doing another movie review let's go I,0.06678436
went to the movie theaters recently with Eddie hi Eddie hi Kevin I had a,0.03801838
great time it was SuperDuper fun got to go to my theater where I work,0.0724544
I have been dying to see this movie ever since it came out in theaters,0.18080588
it's really really new I've been super excited about it and I finally saw it,0.111268304
thanks to Eddie the movie I am talking about is Dunkirk by Christopher Nolan is,0.06298061
a war movie directed by Christopher Nolan I don't think you know this but Christopher,0.15226065
Nolan is my favorite director I love his movies I love them my favorite movie,0.07991861
is inception that I don't think people would think that I think they think it's,0.10704128
Titanic but its inception because that movie has Christopher Nolan and leader Eric Caprio who,0.09161786
is my favorite actor so anything that Christopher Nolan comes out with I will jump,0.2408156
on to see whether people say they like it or not I really like this,0.085527994
jacket too it kind of had the army green so that's why I wore it,0.06416569
and it's really comfortable I wanted to wear it I was definitely a little bit,0.08188108
worried going into this movie just because when you work at the movie theatres you,0.13206506
do hear a lot of the feedback from guests on movies sometimes and I got,0.057492215
really mixed reviews there were some people saying it was great it was wonderful and,0.064457096
then I had people saying it was slow and kind of boring and some even,0.24040572
said it was a little bit confusing but that's a little bit of Christopher Nolan,0.099042825
because let's face it every movie is kind of confusing till it comes to its,0.1495681
end and then you get it and it's this mind-blowing asset so I was a,0.25277114
little bit worried going in but it's off the Christopher Nolan and you always produce,0.11176921
this good content so even his movies that maybe consider not as good really really,0.15223488
good I knew despite what I heard I was going to see it anyway and,0.071975715
I got a lot of good reviews more than anything I really wasn't that worried,0.05249178
about not liking this movie I really loved it and I'm not sure if it's,0.13059108
because I'm biased towards Christopher Nolan and I'm gonna love everything he did but I,0.097223
thought it was awesome it was a great movie it's not that long of a,0.13442233
movie which is weird Christopher Nolan so I don't know if that throws people off,0.23988874
a little bit it's holding in our and 46 minutes so the fact that Christopher,0.085792266
Nolan and it's a war movie which usually doesn't pretty well was kind of shocking,0.23763396
it was that short but I really did like the pace of it overall I,0.07279388
felt it was well built throughout and I thought everybody did a really great job,0.054680385
in this movie definitely an anxiety ridden Leto just letting you know um people told,0.10075937
me they were bored but for me I was just panicking and throughout this entire,0.066884615
movie I'm pretty sure I jumped and scared Eddie a lot I'm sorry about that,0.14052123
can be frustrating a little bit at times and I think the music score in,0.10415802
the background makes it that much more intense because the music in the background is,0.04791162
literally o'clock and when you hear the clock going to tick tick tick tick you're,0.13369422
like what is coming what is going right now and the music was built and,0.0580315
then something would happen but then I go back to the Speaking Clock I just,0.11121538
like you know if you're not looking for a super super be nervous throughout the,0.14524572
entire movie experience to enjoy watch it just watch something mellow and calm when you're,0.08393947
wanting to feel that nervous heart pounding energy watch this movie for those of you,0.38130465
who want statistics this right now has 8.5 out of 10 on IMDB I don't,0.06296979
know it's going to stay there because again it just came out really recently that's,0.09047511
a really good rating and I really don't think it's going to drop that much,0.10001508
farther that's a reasonable T the movie is that rating it's really really good I,0.11186837
think it definitely deserves an 8 or above I loved it I thought it was,0.14900753
fantastic for the actors one thing that I love about this movie especially being a,0.10521189
young aspiring actress myself is seeing all of these new faces that are getting their,0.14893095
breakthroughs I'm pretty sure they've been in the business forever because if you don't know,0.14967223
the system takes forever seeing a movie that's really big directed by this really big,0.065037884
known director and seeing that he put all of these newer faces on the screen,0.072885476
along with some veterans that have been in there forever it felt really nice to,0.06727039
see that and the fact that the main characters in there are played by newer,0.032905012
actors was really nice you're mainly following these newer actors and doing a warning right,0.19006085
now I'm sorry about the nasty names mom there's Phelan Whitehead I don't know pronounced,0.5279541
that way I'm sorry Jamie and Lonard ineuron bernard a bunch of other people harry,0.23959923
styles in this if you like one direction bow Harry Styles he did actually good,0.06812272
job in this so good job Harry style there's more violence Cecilia Murphy there's Kenneth,0.18919049
Branagh Tom Hardy a lot of really great actors and then these newer people and,0.10280299
I really liked that combination for those of you learning synopsis it recreates the historical,0.096392244
events that happened it was a battle on Dunkirk France and basically the battle was,0.053141754
lost the Allies realized that so the British Army decided to try and evacuate their,0.09641525
troops to safety before they can actually all get injured the story is done basically,0.086653754
trying to get these troops back home to England while the Axis powers are constantly,0.2814901
coming at them and trying to stop them and they're on this whole little beach,0.26154009
alone and out in the open so they're pretty easy targets and they're not afraid,0.14717613
to go for those targets the historical event can learn about it go learn about,0.14927238
it Lauren history overall it was really really good I really liked it overall I,0.06770781
don't know if everybody will like it just because again getting the mixed reviews I,0.08007313
think some people will some people long I appreciated the length of it it's weird,0.16431671
see Christopher Nolan in a war movie combines not being SuperDuper long but I do,0.11376279
appreciate that it was short because it kept that intense energy level throughout the movie,0.04238766
for me and I saw it in so many mills which is really cool being,0.10059593
a film fanatic I was really happy my theater was playing it in some new,0.240426
millimeter that's really all I can tell you without spoiling you goodbye non-spoilery people go,0.37271523
watch John Kirk and then come back and then we can discuss all the fields,0.080619484
and your anxiety levels when you come back love you guys goodbye thunder now I,0.22360712
don't know why when I first saw the trailers I thought Tom Hardy was a,0.0716224
bad guy because they always showed him in the airplanes and I airplanes were always,0.28154987
long the beach where all these helpless soldiers are and my mind I'm thinking that,0.11085345
Tom Hardy is the bad guy luckily he wasn't I loved rooting for Tom Hardy,0.19144571
throughout that and he saves there but I was really proud of Tom Hardy even,0.06488855
though his name is an actually Tom Hardy in this Sun I'm still going to,0.0664268
call him Tom Hardy that was a really nice moment in hearing them cheer and,0.14056864
seeing him finally defeat those plays those planes were mourning oh my gosh I cannot,0.19141947
tell you how many times you would hear it and you just wanted to scream,0.1495625
duck at the screen and take cover and you knew people were going to die,0.5876557
and it was soul-crushing because it's every time they got into I they're reloading ship,0.16807537
they launch the ship and it slips and boom I do think that out of,0.08608906
everything you do get a personal connection to some of the characters but not a,0.070799135
ton of them you don't get a super super super super deep connection to anybody,0.26534167
if you got a deep connection to anybody I think it'd be more violence is,0.34291637
character and to Dawson and his son I think those are the characters I personally,0.07419354
was invested in the most and I really wanted them to get to Dunkirk and,0.05752669
be able to help all be soldiers not just because I wanted them to help,0.089926235
all these soldiers but because they were genuine good people all the other ones I,0.15108259
have sympathy for them don't get me wrong and I felt really bad for all,0.13593309
the soldiers but there wasn't a moment of complete utter panic for one character for,0.0753889
me like the moment where gifts and I think dice that didn't impact me I,0.08204156
think as much as it should have I really felt for him and I didn't,0.07767413
wanted today and seeing him struggle in that water was painful it didn't really make,0.06760075
me cry or anything like that because there wasn't enough personal knowledge about the character,0.11369844
for me to actually have an emotional impact on that don't hit me don't get,0.1074544
me wrong and for me what hit me more were situations they were put in,0.19494264
then the actual characters getting hurt themselves it was the risk of danger they were,0.06538865
in and all the soldiers were sitting in that boat waiting for the tide to,0.0693412
come portrayed so they were able to move the ball and get out of there,0.09135817
and they are being shot at and that one guy gets shot in the eye,0.7681867
and then water swirling in and they're threatening to kick gifts and out because he's,0.3571774
French and he should stay behind that was all really intense and I wanted to,0.14524034
prevent them just get out of the stupid boat this is pointless you're not going,0.7120593
into where you're going to drown and then get some done you should just listen,0.66617405
so that's what I meant if those intense situations I felt for that but there,0.030300288
wasn't a moment in there for me where you saw a really tragic kuroh of,0.121723145
destiny even the end with Tom Hardy he gets taken in by the German soldiers,0.24373084
and I get that and he probably dies and that's heart was powerful with the,0.28998727
airplane burning and sacrificing himself knowing that he's going to probably die that was powerful,0.53765965
the younger soldiers I didn't have as much of an impact mr. Dawson and his,0.06889961
son and then Tom Hardy's character in the pilots I really felt for throughout and,0.048436835
I felt for the soldiers too don't get me wrong just not as much as,0.10890425
the others I think it's because the pilots and mr. Dawson in them we're the,0.058143422
ones who could go and save them all where the soldiers themselves were really helpless,0.110899106
so you felt helpless with them but there really wasn't anything you could do so,0.07456811
you were really rooting for the people who could actually go out and do something,0.13715032
and the soldiers in here it's them trying to survive and you feel that and,0.078392595
they don't always do the most righteous thing but they want to survive I thought,0.067974165
Philly a murphy's character was really interesting though the shell-shocked soldier I was really obsessed,0.053738855
on he killed George I was really mad I like spud orders in the paper,0.53490317
at the end though I did like his character overall he was really interesting I,0.05107404
just wish he was in the movie more I think that's the only problem with,0.1482299
the length that I do like the pace but it kind of feels like your,0.09191931
interactions with each character gets cut short if the movie was longer and we get,0.10073133
more invested in the characters and learn about them more Julie emerges character it was,0.057963867
really impactful and you saw war before the guy but he knocks down this kid,0.2425697
and then to have mr. Dawson son telling him that yeah he's going to be,0.13347414
okay when the boy is actually really died to save the soldier from any more,0.35646546
grief so that's the only thing is that I feel like if the movie was,0.092802435
longer I'd have more of an impact with the characters because you whip them longer,0.48002172
not only like characters to be tortured don't get me wrong I just want to,0.31089434
be really personally invested in them and I was in a way just not another,0.05099234
way that scene at the beginning with them trying to get the injury man I,0.10326177
thought they were gonna miss it I'm sorry I thought that was that type of,0.05444131
movie luckily they did it but did oh my gosh then the bone explodes and,0.12543528
the guy's still on there and I was just sitting there one of my hands,0.15150706
my face thinking this was all for nothing they just saved this guy he's a,0.32026598
tunnel then he's been you know we dead I was really mad that was me,0.46602598
and Christopher Nolan because that was a tease because you think they're going to miss,0.13682531
the boat because Christopher Nolan isn't all about super happy happy you don't think they're,0.08654428
going to make the boat but then they do make the bull and then they,0.1110476
can't go on the boat so that's that but then you realize that the guy,0.07516165
that they just put on the boat they just doomed it even more because this,0.11970226
ship tips over Wow way to just play with my emotion and make me think,0.12295494
this guy was somehow going to survive I did get a little bit how people,0.25635508
said it was kind of confusing though there was a timeline element that they did,0.039595656
and at first I was a little confused enjoyed by that when it really first,0.06747089
happened to me that was the Cillian Murphy's character again because we see him on,0.06253632
the boat with mr. Dawson but then it cuts to this moment where he's denying,0.077158935
soldiers to be in this boat not enough room the boat he says and so,0.06740767
find another one and the characters he's talking to are the main soldiers that you're,0.078959346
following and so I was really confused at that because it showed him before he,0.05072915
was shell-shocked and I was just like wait he was just shell-shocked on this boat,0.095308654
wait what her moments like that timeline wise where it wasn't clear that I was,0.08424106
jumping back and moving forward and drumming documenting forward English go deuces deuces deuces just,0.4669977
like that that was a little bit confusing everything that was Rebecca know had to,0.09008507
do with water because since they were on a beach and surrounded by water they're,0.08906344
all drowning it Somali where the pilot is docked at the plane and the water,0.34770837
is coming in I was panicking in family I did not know they were going,0.08131994
to make it asking about for Carolyn if you don't know you really don't know,0.11401916
if they're going to be kick or not the main moments were when the water,0.23917732
was slowly rising and I'm just like this keeps happening they all keep getting stuck,0.07261649
in water channel of water I'm a swimmer this may be not like water in,0.08506578
the movie I'm sorry water I love you you keep me refreshed I have a,0.078745805
glass right here I love you but in the movie you were mean and I,0.2322528
promise characters a little bit confused about again I think it was the lack of,0.07990697
not really getting to know him it's supposed to be this really nice moment when,0.063325495
he says he's going to stay behind and help his fellow countrymen and help the,0.07663723
French in some way and I think that was really noble I just feel again,0.09074301
if we had more of a connection to him personally then it'd be even more,0.07536362
impactful that he's staying behind but it still was a really good strong statement everything,0.08649403
needed here was strong statement and I really enjoyed it it's just upping the level,0.110129185
a little bit and then it would have been completely mind-blowing though it was so,0.18055163
basically mind blowing that's really all I have to say about this movie if you,0.31089434
haven't seen Dunkirk I don't get why you stayed through spoilers but you know what,0.07545429
go go and watch Dunkirk because it's a really good movie overall I think I,0.20674948
would have wanted it to be a little longer just to have more character development,0.119423024
but at the same time I really liked the pace of it and it made,0.040705252
me really anxious throughout this entire thing Thank You Eddie for coming with me that,0.079835765
was really fun let's go again thank you so much for joining me today if,0.10593673
