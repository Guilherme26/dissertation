"An anxious experience that invites participation. Based on a short story by Cornell Woolrich, this mystery thriller by director Alfred Hitchcock earned 36-times its $1 million dollar budget, scored four Academy Award nominations, and is widely regarded as one of the best movies ever made. But even after seeing it twice, I remain unconvinced of its greatness. One of Hitchock's trademarks was his frequent use of point-of-view camera movement, a technique which forced the audience to engage in a form of voyeurism.",0.041091915

"I'm reminded of a particularly memorable occurrence while I was attending college in Boston; when an athletic mid-30s female in the apartment across the street began paddling her pink canoe in full view of our entire floor. Surely she knew people would see her, right? With the lights on, shades open, and mere feet from a college dormitory? It felt like a scene out of a raunchy teen-comedy... everyone gathered around the windows and cheering her on. Were we invading her privacy by watching, or was she enjoying her public display of self-affection? At what point does shameful voyeurism become acceptable entertainment?",0.10441469
"And when might it become a civic obligation? ""Rear Window"" attempts to examine both of these themes by way of a relatable, if lethargic story. Jimmy Stewart stars as a wheelchair-confined photographer, who spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them has committed murder. And although every scene he witnesses seems sinister and dangerous, the script is quick to provide alternate explanations, as if to discredit itself, and play Stewart off as a 'boy who cried wolf'.

"technicolor, the 112-minute film makes excellent use of its confined location. Remarkably, the camera never leaves Stewart's apartment; but with a multitude of angles, focal lengths, and color-changes, Hitchcock keeps things from becoming repetitive or claustrophobic.

"fake-apartments. Perhaps ""Rear Window's"" most effective accomplishment is how it imprints Stewart's uncomfortable emotions onto the viewer. What begins with guilt soon transforms to anxiety and fear, and later, obligation and heroism.
