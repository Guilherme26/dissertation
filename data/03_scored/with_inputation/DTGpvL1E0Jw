hi guys I'm Maria and welcome back to Santa club today I'm going to be,0.08692056
reviewing the new Pixar movie for you which is inside out I have been waiting,0.19341618
for this movie to come out for a very long time we have talked about,0.09391026
it multiple times in our movie podcast now conspiring and we've been very excited about,0.114708215
it and it's finally here and I got to see it last night I don't,0.10858036
want to give away too much of the plot because i feel like if you,0.23966102
say too much it gives away the magic and i feel also like the creators,0.1107349
have done a really good job and not saying too much about what happens that,0.063037805
really keeps the interest in mystery alive and I feel like that's how you should,0.088367015
go into this movie not know you so much about it except that it's about,0.127003
the voices inside your head how they work and you know how you react when,0.15328002
things change in your life I have to say the first half of the movie,0.15431787
really blew me away they do such a great job and explain to you how,0.24261771
it slowly develops the first emotion that comes into Riley's life immediately after she's born,0.16581544
is happiness which goes to show that humans are innately happy from the very beginning,0.10763025
and then right after about half a minute later comes sadness and that's where babies,0.17504242
cry and they feel uncomfortable and it's really fun to see these five emotions slowly,0.103279084
come together and work as a team to create great memories for Riley five main,0.049786463
emotions are joy sadness disgust anger and fear and they're all so much fun of,0.2672703
course they're mainly one-dimensional because they're supposed to represent one particular voice of one particular,0.052723896
emotion so right from the beginning i'm not expecting full development from each of these,0.0828719
characters because together they are one great fully developed character which is riley they just,0.041483734
give you such a colorful and you know creative yet so accurate world of how,0.0736258
your mind works so all your character traits are built in link different islands and,0.23979895
you have this huge huge sort of area which is your long term memory which,0.11380348
is really fun as well and you get to see things like abstract thought know,0.076979555
the train of thoughts imaginary land which was probably everybody's favorite so it's a fun,0.054360848
adventure it's a fun ride throughout the mind of somebody and it's super compelling it,0.12764712
keeps you really interested but I feel like after you to know the world pretty,0.10518165
well the movie kind of just like slowly decreases in interest and in the element,0.078129284
of surprise I really had a hard time figuring out what it is that I,0.09814549
didn't like about the movie when you watch a Pixar movie or at least the,0.07664079
ones that I really love there's just something about them that just really blows you,0.4179179
away and it's not to say that this movie is not incredible that I just,0.10974544
didn't get the same feeling one of the things that really started to put me,0.042605042
off the movies that we focus a lot of what's going on inside the mine,0.10950835
which is kind of so to speak a technical issue which is now affecting Riley's,0.0668615
emotions something goes wrong I can't really explain it without giving too much away and,0.07863846
Riley's reacting to it because you know that's what's happening in her mind and I,0.122707926
first I thought that was great because that's exactly what you go through in this,0.07437827
period of time in your life and confused you get angry you're kind of like,0.31089434
talking back to your parents so you're not joyful all the time but then it,0.32274705
quickly becomes like we don't know what we're doing in the system so Riley is,0.05961071
reacting kind of like a robot that's the part that I mainly didn't like I,0.074608065
understand moments where she should be angry and anger is taking control of the whole,0.14966299
situation but there are moments where it just doesn't make sense and it does feel,0.03850163
like she's just a robot reacting to the buttons these guys are pushing in her,0.11999159
mind there's a moment where she sees this rail and she's super pumped to just,0.16713476
slide down it but then all of a sudden she's not she gets kind of,0.1664976
sad and then all of a sudden she's like whoo yeah let's do it one,0.24032214
more time those are the kind of things that overall don't make sense and don't,0.08115378
feel organic to the process of someone's emotions she doesn't feel like full-fledged character she,0.10215948
feels just a little strange in these reactions I really wish there would have been,0.053818934
a bigger balance between what's going on outside of reminder what's going inside I don't,0.05453306
feel like there's a lot happening outside for these reactions to have merit sure she's,0.061251525
going through a tough time yes there has been changed but I was expecting more,0.058745395
things to happen in her daily life that would marry these sort of strange reactions,0.13704357
inside of her head that was kind of a downer because Riley is a really,0.39995742
cool character and I really wanted to see more from her and I really enjoy,0.051982332
the moments where you see her but you still hear all the voices for example,0.06199054
she goes into room and there's like all these things like Oh what if this,0.1027929
happens which is fear and disgust is going like nope this is not going to,0.24931958
work enjoys trying to be very positive about everything and thought that was great because,0.13942295
that's exactly how your mind works you have all these different thoughts about a same,0.1104955
circumstance I really enjoyed those moments and I really enjoyed the animation I mean I,0.09682467
think that goes without saying there are times were you seen Riley crying and her,0.20984218
expressions are just so accurate and so beautifully done she flushes around her nose and,0.37359592
her cheeks when she cries I thought it was fantastic not to mention that the,0.47475225
characters inside her head are just so unique and vibrant and colorful there's a little,0.18030557
detail that I loved that I kind of only noticed enjoy I didn't know if,0.09598159
I noticed it and the other ones joy skin like the outline is not as,0.21159583
defined as the human beings in the movie I can't explain it i don't want,0.19051094
to say pixelated because it's not that but there is sort of like a softness,0.1523381
in a bit of a you know sprinkly kind of look to her skin and,0.31089434
she's glowy and I'd kind of like that because i feel like it resembles that,0.16870195
she's a bit abstract she's inside her mind she's not a concrete beam there's many,0.53490317
details like that throughout the movie that make it amazing and of course you noticed,0.0753712
that it's Pixar and it's their amazing attention to detail and their original characters that,0.058375075
just makes it so fantastic I let the theatre is really liking the movie thinking,0.15080246
that it's really great not one of their best though but that's just my opinion,0.091014616
I know people are just raving about it and they're so enamored with this world,0.31089434
that they have created they feel like it's so original maybe it's just my standard,0.07041753
reaction to the overhead two reactions of the media that makes it feel kind of,0.060615774
uneven but I just don't think it's as incredible as people are saying it is,0.08331398
I think you quickly start noticing that it's really the same formula Pixar has been,0.108336166
using for quite a while it's a great formula but you start noticing that it's,0.082253255
just something you've seen before you have the story that starts out really peachy everything,0.1521812
is perfect but then something happens and these characters need to go back to a,0.10043132
place where they belong like toy story like finding Nemo and then there's the whole,0.09137392
dynamic of the two main characters that don't really like they're kind of opposite in,0.10470931
so many ways like finding Nemo up Toy Story and at one point something happens,0.08430117
the characters get upset one of them ditched the other like a finding nemo a,0.102409035
toy story but then their room night did they realize they're better when they're together,0.091012836
they're really good friends do timing doesn't it sound familiar again it's not to say,0.06121071
that the movies not good it's just that the publicity and the reactions have been,0.059349146
so high up and so exaggerated when you finally go see the movie the expectations,0.09554958
are like all out of whack overall it's a great movie it's really fun it,0.4937734
gets emotional at certain places which is to be expected I didn't point it as,0.048770618
emotional as other Pixar movies but there's a few moments where you're like okay you,0.103019886
got me pics are I'm crying in the theater thanks so that's if I had,0.18788634
to rate this movie for you I would tell you that inside out is worth,0.3190197
