how do you guys know know about this move have you not like paying attention san francisco california tell me how i just found out that san francisco is in california,0.09434324
i feel dumb for not knowing that is that common knowledge because i did not know that here's our new house that is so small that is so disappointing of a house i would hate that let's go get our stopper in the moving van all right goodbye,0.56897914
well guess what the moving van won't be here until thursday you're kidding everything seems to be going wrong,0.1232219
and joy is just trying to hold on like crazy,0.43489864
see you sweetie dad just left us,0.12467235
oh he doesn't love us anymore,0.17086755
that's sad,0.050168827
i should drive right joy,0.15477385
what are you doing,0.07937409
uh i love this,0.06799291
i'm only a few minutes in and i'm loving like the symbolism what the heck is that it's broccoli on pizza,0.31089434
that's it,0.05140533
i'm done congratulations san francisco you've ruined pizza,0.41516975

right,0.04255815
now oh come on it could be worse,0.2504257
yeah joy we could be lying on the dirty floor in a bag,0.67155385
i guess all i really want to say is thank you,0.066523924
huh,0.05334757
you know through all this confusion you've stayed,0.16027533
well you've stayed our happy girl your dad's under a lot okay that is so not a good thing to tell your daughter smiling,0.42316312
it would be a big help that is no for him right,0.11970615
no oh that's that's upsetting me to my core,0.120280474
yeah sure honestly guys,0.06879786
i'm kind of relating a bit too much like i'm feeling a bit too much relating a bit too much to sadness and like after some i've gone through i just know that you cannot say that to someone because it just it's going to hurt them a lot more trying forcing themselves to be happy trying to put a smile on their face,0.31089434
it's just it's so not good and it's so straining on that person their body and mind,0.53490317
and i i hate that i'm actually really connected to what this movie is trying to do with joy being really pushy,0.4047605
she honestly seems like the villain of this movie so far,0.32199654
okay,0.050967906
i really like that song that like gentle music,0.05466345
it's i don't know why it's making me emotional like i'm preparing my body for what's gonna come,0.30771336
you know i'm gonna make sure that tomorrow is another great day,0.09542785
i promise today wasn't even a good day,0.1545843
how can you make sure tomorrow's a good day,0.08534876
that's my thing did you see that look they're judging us but everything's different,0.077450804
now okay,0.054177463
this is so sad and so hard to watch okay,0.16605347
i don't know imagine being the king of guys,0.24119699
that's a core memory,0.08969246
joy is legit,0.06170525
the villain of this movie like what the hell you're not in headquarters without you riley can't be happy honestly,0.67279667
i feel like you're describing depression,0.1578426
she has no identity and no hap like no way feeling happy because joy's gone her core personalities and everything is just gone that is they have to be describing like depression or something there uh-oh she's looking at us uh what did she say oh oh sorry sir no,0.18233229
one was listening is it garbage night,0.47938144
uh we left the toilet,0.37974587
seat up what what is it woman what he's making that stupid face again,0.9323429
i could strangle him right,0.82583433
now signal him again,0.10545134
ah so riley how was school for this,0.07997953
we gave up that brazilian helicopter pilot,0.1500161
well what i want to know more about that that's it go to your room,0.11938744
now foot is down,0.1503018
the foot is down,0.11513585
good job,0.054077584
gentlemen that could have been a disaster,0.24220152
well that was a disaster,0.17678049
oh my gosh this mom is legit like not in this relationship right,0.40334505
now she's not here for it okay that actually hurts,0.30515605
it's like she's losing a part of herself part for personality,0.24197249
damn i'm relating to this way too much,0.8249984
it's actually hurting ugh,0.18837899
that's sad,0.05016883
why is this movie just sad,0.08120814
without even trying i mean it's probably trying if you want to walk the long way go for it,0.09592615
but riley needs to be happy,0.06551803
i'm not missing that train,0.10362088
bing bong knows what he's doing he's part dolphin they're very smart joy's a narcissist,0.50926775
i just realized that she's like riley needs me like i know she needs to be happy like but like you know,0.15257369
what i mean,0.085002795
she thinks a lot too much about herself that is my favorite,0.08088773
oh it's so soft,0.08994337
oh let me try hey what's the big idea,0.091299616
you better fix that wall or else,0.07278158
you're invincible,0.16047074
he just murdered,0.7686997
somebody okay,0.09789824
i like bing bong that's wow,0.1205923
yeah i stashed it in there for safekeeping,0.07408447
and now i'm all set to take riley to the moon,0.156671
he is destroying everything like all around him,0.44727537
i would have sworn sparkle pony mount was right,0.14754015
here,0.053441156
hey what's going on,0.07957203
well,0.039254032
yeah,0.040847696
i i don't know princess dream world,0.18472354
oh the stuffed animal hall of fame,0.18378134
oh oh they're tearing down her old imaginations okay because it's old and she's growing up okay that's sad ah this whole movie is just showing about growing up and like all the changes as we can see in her mind her imagination being forgotten,0.15173875
her memories being thrown away just a lot of things changing,0.11242198
oh gosh why does that make me so emotional,0.13668984
once we flew back in time we had breakfast twice that day see i love how sadness is comforting,0.0809654
sadness is like there's a use for her,0.08703458
we were best friends,0.032043133
if you can't understand that pain,0.17887034
yeah i can't connect with people,0.12205852
no these facts and opinions look so similar,0.091253
ah don't worry about it happens all the time that's hilarious actually that that,0.111516155
yeah how about we wake her up sadness,0.121805884
that's ridiculous how could we possibly how about we wake her up great,0.5991479
idea jordan thanks come on,0.12182701
yeah narcissist joy is a narcissist we're gonna make her so happy she'll wake up with exhilaration we'll excite her awake and that's never that's not possible,0.6364068
if you're happy in a dream you want to stay dreaming you just don't want to wake up like,0.18256956
i just wanted to sleep for 10 hours like i was not tired anymore,0.17614172
but i felt my dream made me feel happy,0.09654896
so i stayed sleeping that is terrifying,0.12036888
that's really all you care about your friend is being locked up this looks so cool,0.24666716
i really like the way subconscious looks you know for a fact there's like some badass thoughts down there in the subconscious,0.28849372
it's broccoli is black looking that terrifying,0.35544518
i never hated this,0.12913752
i actually usually always liked it candy wrappers,0.060474593
why is he in a clown jail with like balloons that's hilarious,0.64149237
oh because there's a crowd okay are kind of scary,0.17843336
i mean i've never had an encounter with clowns,0.49360803
i wouldn't know i mean yeah i think like some clouds are scary like i feel like people who make like some kinds of scary because they got a way to be scary,0.17570601
but i'm i don't know i have not i've not like had a personal bad experience with the clown that you are making so much noise,0.60497105
can you not okay,0.11086926
that's that is concerning,0.05175607
okay that is creepy,0.18465692
did you say birthday this time is freaking me out i promise okay,0.42933655
can you,0.06744802
please stop no,0.09331677
that's not,0.0632968
it was a dream,0.050636176
this is ridiculous,0.5922953
we can't even get a good night's sleep anymore time to take action stupid mom and dad if they had moved us,0.8496929
none of this would have happened,0.09945911
i'm like anger's character i like that he's taking control and he's representing,0.20621262
what would actually happen like the feelings and emotions that would you'd feel in this situation stop you're hurting riley no,0.14537595
no no i did it again,0.082426764
if you get in here these core memories will get sad i'm sorry riley needs to be happy,0.10280139
joy is really pissing me off like she's really the villain here leaving sadness behind and stuff like that only focusing on herself and wanting to feel happy,0.65181774
oh my god this is pixar did such a good analogy with this okay that has given me some avengers memories that that okay that scared me and it's like your subconscious fear,0.18372409
oh okay okay this is making me sad wow she used to stick her tongue out when she was coloring it's feeling like someone died and it's like just her memories but it's like feeling like a part of her diary basically heard that she died and it's actually sad,0.26420814
i don't like that three tears came now oh my eyes burned now two tears came out bedtime,0.32894275
i hate it seeing those things fade away it just makes me sad,0.30913356
it was the day the prairie dogs lost,0.24718007
the big playoff thing marley missed the winning challenge,0.060596414
this is a great thing about how happiness can only come,0.11070432
once you like sadness after sadness and like events like or it's just like,0.05700347
it's yin yang they both have to come together it balances out which is true all the time though if you're sad someone will come and help you but that's not,0.091126435
it's not always the case and that sucks that really,0.794439
does okay,0.061351515
gosh this is giving me way too much infinity vibes i'm not this one,0.13855454
i'm not liking,0.15249743
it's giving me a lot of experiments,0.1409893
oh that's so heartbreaking take her to the moon for me,0.13171044
okay,0.050967902
why don't you fade away like that just,0.24070974
so not fair that is so not it's so not okay,0.077110276
this is shady as hell,0.5341344
i feel worried for you just let me go riley's better off without me coming,0.29276484
oh my god,0.059858847
why is that why is this movie just hitting different like santa's being like,0.16490526
let me go,0.10766344
joey's better off without me because you know when you're like sad or like depressed you're just like you just wanted to go away you just want the sadness go away you want you want to be happy,0.45017767
it's legit,0.06211777
this is this is the embodiment of that we can't make riley feel anything,0.09185203
oh that is that's terrible,0.22551729
she is fully honestly,0.09571426
she is fully committed to the whole she's like the deepest sad she's depressed depressed,0.31089434
ah poor rally like feeling that at such a young age i don't think you printed enough boyfriends that's okay,0.24101162
i love that i love the dedication design for her yep loving that and we don't support dying for something,0.15294877
oh i wish joy was here kind of dumb,0.7697845
but i'm just saying in this movie's house,0.06780982
well what would you do if you're so smart i tell you but you're too dumb to understand,0.86812747
what of course your tiny brain is confused i love,0.5739117
i like disgust like i like her personality,0.69542736
she seems like that sassy friend i think you're really kind of like mean,0.6573652
i don't know like could be bullying others,0.19970338
but like she's not really like that,0.13673435
and she's not like a boy for you,0.5154597
you know what i mean riley,0.1404632
oh we were worried sick where have you been it's so late okay i'm i'm liking this,0.31089434
so far the like ending,0.14188884
and so i don't know i just feel like pixar's gonna come out and just hit you but but okay wow okay,0.32792392
this is something a lot harder than i thought it would this is not okay,0.07780445
i know you don't want me to but i miss home,0.11974595
i miss minnesota you need me to be happy,0.10330202
but i want my old friends and my hockey team i want to go home please don't be mad,0.1703847
i'm so glad she's talking to her parents,0.24027498
oh i'm glad that she's talking and they're being nice,0.09211653
gosh,0.10844589
why does pixar do this to us in that song we heard in the beginning that like soft instrumental,0.07308246
oh it's going back again,0.057547063
hey i'm liking this new view friendship island's expanded glad,0.113428645
they finally opened that friendly argument section i like tragic vampire romance island fashion island,0.11137884
oh everyone shut up boyband island,0.65156555
hope,0.058086112
that's just a phase say what you want,0.11477259
i think it's all beautiful,0.072799645
i love that there you go i love that expanded console is up she's um maturing and going through so more emotions expanded consoles guys what's puberty,0.18562663
yeah oh it's probably not important,0.1846752
sorry,0.041893564
okay,0.050967906
i love that i love that okay um,0.06971467
wow tears came out of me with that one okay that was something that was something i felt and dealt with with a lot of tears um,0.1525756
i really like inside out,0.10657831
i really like what it teaches you and like what it tells and like for people i don't know like i i can like emotionally connect to it,0.15048306
and pixar is just really great at doing that um i'm sorry if i wasn't like as energetic and like funny and silly as i would be during this commentary just like this movie i connect to it a little bit too much and like i didn't i honestly did not know what to say sometimes and like i didn't know what joke jokes to make or anything,0.44408277
it was like i was just like watching absorbing and i didn't want to like talk too much like preaching this,0.060546204
so that's why i was kind of like that um,0.09763721
and it's like late in the afternoon,0.061446313
it's like what it's one,0.110992074
and so i am um i'm a little bit tired but i'm not like that tired,0.14904824
but yeah i am um,0.058475994
yeah i think more people show attention in inside out it's it's a really good movie and like as someone who's like been the press before that was like complete that was such a good way to represent it like forcing happiness on top of yourself like being like,0.24174103
i need to be happy and hating sadness like hating sadness so much thinking it's so like useless and it's like why why do i feel sad just like yeah and all the anger the fear to discuss that comes with that like towards sadness and towards just everything that doesn't make you happy,0.29211715
it's just like,0.05661034
so it's so true and i really like that and i really like like at the end they like accept sadness and realize that sadness has like you need it in your emotions,0.10632072
you need to feel sadness like to feel empathy like with helping bing bong like i mean my sense of empathy has grown but also because of sadness the thing the things like i took for granted before things i loved i loved even more like i loved tv before but now i love tv even more not being able to feel the happiness that it once gave me and then regaining that happiness,0.100309834
i'm never gonna let that go and just like it just like,0.14951625
yeah i am not the same person,0.14963627
i was a year ago,0.06378615
but i like this person i am now i like the videos i'm making on youtube that makes me happy like all the people i'm connecting with with you so that makes me happy,0.2411774
i like continuing watching tv and trying and um applying for college to be director applying for college is so hard and stressful,0.08729419
so wish me luck with that,0.064087026
but yeah that's what i like inside out,0.11802253
and i'm sorry this wasn't my like giddy up happy video and like you're probably not gonna like it,0.35324836
but like i'm glad i watched it and said these things in front of the camera because at least i said it in front of people instead of just thinking it,0.079335466
so people know how i feel whoever does watch this,0.14546344
but i'm yeah anyway stop talking about myself that was a good movie and like anyone who's feeling sad,0.18739687
i should probably watch that and get some a good cry out of it,0.15431614
and just like enjoy how much you can relate to it,0.028583495
and how much it shows that there are people out there that who understand you and understand that feeling because that is that is good to show um,0.08693876
