Malone's classic film club you'll investigate you have your shadow do watch every minute from,0.11788028
now on so I had never seen double indemnity probably because there was the released,0.11290931
a year before my mother was born but um when I got into it I,0.1766938
really enjoyed it like it was a little slow at times and you know the,0.11465131
it's a very old fashioned in some places even just from the clothes like the,0.10446478
guy wears the Fred MacMurray is the shirin salesman a Barbara Stanwyck is the wife,0.17215706
that convinces him to kill her husband and you know he his his uh waste,0.8839628
the of his pants are up to his nipples just about and you know he,0.8981648
talks to you and I hold that old film talked you know baby yeah I,0.13496041
want to do this like it's definitely the product of its time but it's interesting,0.058899134
because the actual tone of the film is incredibly dark I mean the story is,0.09821683
about a guy murdering someone and then trying to cover it up it's incredibly dark,0.53490317
at the same time like it's not dark like a movie today would be because,0.11122606
it like even though things are happening or really I mean he's kind of evil,0.32893753
the main character but like you as you're meant to like him and it's only,0.113464005
that's some though so on about it because like he's talking all y'all that old,0.30038726
speak and this at the same time he's doing horrible things and I it's an,0.29569665
interesting the economy in the film and while I don't think a movie like this,0.05772402
could be made today with such a dark tone at the same time there is,0.10720553
no really graphic violence shown on screen I mean there are murderers and people are,0.4033937
shot and stuff goes down but they don't really show it like this kind of,0.24247472
happens like off-screen or like you see late yeah you know that don't show it,0.09596235
all the same time similarly they don't have any sex like the guys murdering people,0.69542736
for this girl you don't even have sex with her like because as you know,0.86052096
I think you know they had limitations back then with what they could show but,0.049330235
the same time they the tone could be really dark and it's interesting the same,0.042340953
time like the sexiest part is when the UH the Fred MacMurray kind of gets,0.11225482
entranced by her ankles oh there's some sexy ankles you wanna murder your husband I'm,0.8366681
down just don't cover up them ankles one thing I didn't like though is that,0.09781549
because you know has that whole that film noir trope I guess I may not,0.15298511
be the trope of the time of the person narrating the movie and the you,0.17794709
know at the beginning basically he's telling the he's recorded making a recording of everything,0.073942095
they did so he kind of know from we bright from beginning that he did,0.059713203
murder the girl's husband and like I would have that there's a moment in the,0.7691864
movie where he acts like you kidding I'm not gonna do that kid she starts,0.31089434
to hint at something when she's when he's trying to sell her insurance and she's,0.08003719
trying to hint at maybe buying some accident insurance for him and what that may,0.15015854
entail and you know he responds like a person should respond but then he goes,0.1364921
back and like I almost like if I knew he had to go back like,0.09747515
it was like the more if I didn't know that I think you know and,0.06227568
I kind of enjoyed the narration you know it worked well with the film and,0.03709903
fit in nicely as in general I don't like when essentially movie Constable's itself so,0.0848365
overall I really enjoyed the Double Indemnity like I would recommend that if you're looking,0.08574865
for a classic film noir to look to watch and that's something that's really different,0.08246495
from movies we see in nowadays and I it's really interesting if I give it,0.05637894
like a seven point seven five out of ten there's some like that's well thanks,0.0769193
