this is my father's so Wonder Woman the story of an Amazonian princess travels to the world of men to try to stop a war by destroying the God of War we see what shakes her into how she thinks and watch the equation thing we see her growing through her power and we see how all of this sheltered life had affect her as soon as she comes to real world like she knows nothing she's worse than Jon Snow she knows nothing at all I think we have to remember that this is her order story this is how she became one of them's a lot of people don't really know about Wonder Woman so going in this movie noted they're going to be a lot of build-up for characters all the acting in this is superb Chris time does an awesome job Gaza dog does awesome job Danny husband does an awesome job as the villain David Thewlis that Dickinson's dudes named David do this he does a great job as well it's one of the main characters onto the movie itself when they're on the island of the mascara hey do not shy away from black Amazonian and that made my heart jump yeah it's one thing where they show the Greek gods battling and I thought the art direction that one scene like the way they did it was really awesome India if y'all have seen any my reviews character me relating and we care about the characters is really big for me it's like a huge thing for me and the fact that they were able to do that it did that was hardly did that with her mother of course Diana Creek spine character his little ragtag group like his friends I liked them all I really liked them all it was I feel like the director did really well with how she brought them in how she developed them so quickly and made me care few times I was tearing up there are certain things that I probably should have been tearing up on but I felt like they were my friends so the chemistry between Chris Vaughn and Goddard oh he has the teacher everything he has you know she's copy asking question and she's playing off of him and you know she knows stuff because she's read books but she hasn't experienced nothing so he is her first experience in France in the world of men and the way they play off each other in the way today interact is a one the only bad thing about this movie was there in the third act I want to say right before finalizing the third act there was this long stretch me about I'm not long 23 minutes it just seemed to drag and drag and drag that's when I started feeling the time of movies with any kind of pickup at that I picked up again I lost my got lots of moving here other than that the pacing was good I felt like the story moves along very nicely I think it was good for her first movie but one more thing that kind of bothered me sometimes the soundtrack did not fit the scene in my opinion it was a big deal most of the one knows that but just just me seem like DC is suffering from a catch up complex so they try to fit a lot into their movies and it kind of blows the movies but it was a much more enjoyable two and half hours in Batman versus Superman the overall story the overall feel of the movie I had fun Huell I got my my Wonder Woman teachings my armbands my arm shield I got my Wonder Woman shirt had a good time I hope compared to the first Iron Man the first Iron Man was great story great pacing great origin story told you about the character built them up this one does the same thing Wonder Woman you're wondering my book so I give it a minus and a Wonder Woman is just playing wonderful but that is my opinion don't see the movie I think whatever the hell you want to think parts of Africa there's no black you when you're in you know different parts of the world or even the universe there's no black people and I felt like it was a win because there was so many strong black and Mazzoni in' and they didn't like they did shy away from it at all like everything they show Amazon they were in there so that was cool to see don't forget to like try or comment down there series friends family I love to Twitter Oh
