this is Samuel Leggett representing Team JVs to my great pleasure I was able to go and attend the Middleburg Film Festival 2019 in Virginia,0.093516044
this had a slew of variously amazing films that have won awards all across from TIFF to Venice to all around,0.10993083
and there was one film that was probably one of the first films that I saw @mf of 2019,0.19355118
I really want to talk to you guys about I'm talking about the portrait of the lady on fire this film,0.3180528
it was actually directed by Celine Saima,0.039289523
I apologize for pronunciation of the different names Claire muffin was the cinematographer and the cast range from I make sure I get all the cast and get all this out of the way Noemi Marlin play the role of Maryann Adele had no play the role of hey Louise,0.05535046
and they are the two stars of this film,0.08845071
now this is the synopsis of the story on an isolated island on Bettany,0.090114005
at the end of the 18th century a female painter is obligated to paint a wedding portrait of a young woman simple premise right,0.14486592
but I was looking and I was like I see so many amazing different scores and reviews cinema scores,0.03330626
I think right now currently out of 93 rating,0.1231464
so I was like what is it about this story,0.06448222
what is it about this film that has elevated people's response like this,0.09526917
and I will tell you this is one of the best films I've seen all year this probably is one of the best foreign films I've seen in the past three years to be quite honest with you,0.06962698
now break it down,0.16724475
and tell you why so breaking out from the cinematography,0.112518966
what they were able to do with a lot of the shots,0.13938951
we're just mind melting because it opens up on the the ocean,0.15173405
you have Mary and is going to the island and kind of going with her painting materials and try to do everything she need to do,0.0889452
and the first thing that happens she has to go over for some unseen reason,0.10359863
but the camera never leaves the atmosphere what I mean by that is mary-louise again is an artist and they take so much careful detail to the way she paints the way she draws the way that the characters interact they are very personal istic,0.092869945
there's an amazing moment by a campfire,0.047461435
that there's this Harmonist ik like noise is happening where people are singing,0.22812147
people are dancing,0.049232963
but the way that this actually shot is just,0.18710475
so it pulls you in on so many different levels,0.16667657
but at the same time there's an elegance behind it because a big part of this film is the love story is the the essence of art and the beauty behind like painting and drawing and just the art form in general and it goes from different ranges of that it can go from at a certain point,0.0535414
there was a moment where hey Louise and Mary Andy are going at a piano and Mary Louise starts to play this interesting tune and like you're just immersed into that now one of the biggest key points about this is the sound the score there is,0.08185763
technically no rhythmic score throughout the film it's very silent film,0.08439684
but their attention to detail whether it's the waves whether it is the the paint Brussels hitting against,0.08444235
the canvas whether it is like the interaction like the human touch whether it's like this,0.14887527
unseemly moment where it feels very uncomfortable and like you hear like the scratching of like a chair or like something going on in the background or like at a campfire,0.09847314
you hear the popping of the the wood or the materials or the the leaves,0.088179514
this crackling the sound design is perfect because it lays the atmosphere for everything,0.11067617
that's actually happening,0.053730864
what other film kind of did something similar to that which was a lighthouse where their atmosphere was one of the biggest catalyst for the film,0.07726973
but there's there's technically not a real big score throughout this,0.06301355
it's just the sound design is just perfect,0.056360684
now,0.031218953
let's go to the platform of the actual actresses and the people that were played in it fit with this,0.09022669
so within this of course you have Adele Hansel know me Marlin with the main two leads but you also have apologize for I'm not even gonna try to name her her last name but Luna plays a role of Sophie and Valeria garli,0.065878056
no plays a role of like Humpty's who is hey Louise's mother and really that's it,0.16171783
there is no other cast,0.09589654
there's really not any male characters that are primary leaves or secondary leads,0.13302118
the only time you actually see male figures in this film are they're going and carrying luggage or their the background or people are talking about what their connection is with this,0.10933341
now again,0.041201644
this is a very this is a French film English subtitles,0.037393827
but there was never a moment that I have missed the step,0.056353305
there was never a moment,0.065770455
I felt like I had to pause,0.0956719
because that was going to class,0.08376779
it's very paced very well matter of fact I would say its pace perfectly because the the tension builds with the relationships that are had because when Mary Louise when not Mary Louise when Mary Ann gets there like she's kind of like put in the situation where like okay nobody's helping me to get here,0.12067831
I need to get where I need to go,0.0507165
but she's very independent she's very you know passionate,0.15310584
and the actress that plays the role of Mary Ann is so perfect because she comes across very crass and yet passionate and very artsy but yet standoffish but then she like consistently kind of drinks wine consistently you know smokes her pipe and so you know she's kind of like trying to think trying to process trying to get into her own headspace but keeping people to a distance where the other side of that the parallel to that is hey Louise who really just doesn't want her face to be painted,0.15183161
I'm not gonna say the reasons why but she doesn't want to be painted,0.149107
she kind of like wants to be on her own and she's had tragedies before her life,0.24209833
that's platformed her to the way in the direction,0.10530911
she goes now then they are connected together,0.07601485
and these actresses are so amazing because the thing about it is yes,0.09484273
they can act there's in their scenes,0.093242034
and the moments just by themselves they can act very well but when they are together like it is some of the most amazing imagery of art and compassion and empathy and stress and worry and concern and empathy that are stretched through all different levels in the short amount of time in the gap of this film,0.0718078
and I was like there's so many different raw emotions that are,0.045914102
so efficiently done that I was I was captivated I'm gonna be very honest,0.19701304
I was very much so captivated and then they interact with the younger person who Sophie who kind of like you know taking care of the place and kind of not undertake it but she has her own store,0.15342198
she has her own atmosphere that's going on but there's never a moment where you feel like all this so dreary and so drought,0.14029844
that's one of the things about favor up that towards the the third half of the film I was kind of mean isn't the present man is is rough,0.14710948
there are moments of levity not just comedy but just like natural progression of characters like they come to really come into their own come into who they're meant to be who they are to each other and this all different ranges of emotions that are effortlessly effortless effort Leslie done and displays through the screenplay because the screenplay I think plays the most part of it,0.068406835
I'm not sure how much of this was improv but it felt like the script was just tight,0.06869895
and I mean I have to give credit where credit's due when it comes to the directing for this one because the movie knew exactly what it needed to be it didn't try to reach,0.033774666
it didn't try to go super natural,0.070609555
we didn't try to go too artsy,0.07027089
it was the perfect blend of every one of those different dimensions of genre and again Celine Saima,0.067596376
I give her a lot of credit because this right here to me should be and would be in my personal opinion up for Best Picture nomination not just best foreign film I've not seen parasite,0.24933393
I've heard great accolades about that I've also not seen,0.07584754
what was the other film was a farewell,0.053040307
I haven't seen that,0.051056664
but this film right here to me could be a contender for best picked,0.083702445
and for me I give this nothing less than a ten out of ten I know I didn't go too much into the story,0.1245833
I think that the the mood and the movie in himself,0.09795384
it immerses,0.051981475
you enough that you are gonna make this story in and out what you feel it's gonna be,0.12684771
and what you feel behind it,0.1820313
and by the end of it you know I was in tears I was laughing I was taking it back with every single moment,0.11981976
and I think that the the the cast were amazing the sound design was excellent,0.08854338
the cinematography was immaculately beautiful and the essence behind art form mix,0.098849684
with camaraderie,0.040069435
friendship love is the spread throughout this entire film,0.11020597
and they just glistens perfectly it is the perfect painting,0.0691682
I think that's the best way of kind of complementing this film hopefully you guys,0.12955129
