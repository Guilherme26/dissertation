and then of course like he she gets caught and it's just this whole idea of being confined,0.15536158
and the way that alfred hitchcock like makes you feel the way that the main character feels and makes you see things through his eyes and connect with him on a way that i don't know that i've ever connected to a character that much and then at the ending when like you really feel confined and helpless it is,0.31089434
