her she cleans the household she loves the children that she looks after and she,0.15120663
lives a very very simple life this is by no means a plot driven film,0.12480327
it's very much character driven we are following cleo seeing things happen to her through,0.05254774
her eyes through her points of view but it's more about a scene setting it's,0.1544828
more about living this immersive view into the family into this very specific time capsule,0.12277765
of history and showing that maybe things haven't changed so much today in 2018 as,0.039476585
we might like to think they have her on is a big fan of the,0.06582227
effect that a cleverly constructed single take can bring he did it fantastically in children,0.1096224
of men one of my favorite movie scenes of all time and here in roma,0.16213699
there is another one that takes place on the beach and it's toward the end,0.08430439
of the film but it is very much a climactic and extremely emotional moment on,0.048368625
the beach in the waves all from the side angle of cleo as we follow,0.061588917
her and we track her up and down the beach and into the water no,0.15272444
that she can't swim and it is just it is so tense it's done so,0.13195328
simply that it's even more effective than if they put all this dramatic music all,0.21309279
these cuts from the water under the water following around up close it's sort of,0.0634637
like by stepping back and just following it in this real-time way it's it's even,0.07531902
more like heart pounding I adored this film from start to finish I was so,0.14047326
invested in the character of Cleo in her decisions and how she was going to,0.05926497
manage the obstacles that kept coming up against her the way that she fits into,0.12727895
the family dynamics is really fascinating in the relationship especially between her and the mother,0.07414924
you know the matriarch of the family how they kind of fit together it just,0.2796432
felt really real they don't always see eye to eye but at the end of,0.056317102
the day they both care for the children the only thing I will note is,0.089525096
that this is portrayed in a romanticized wait a snapshot of time from qur'an's own,0.09592538
childhood so it's him as a filmmaker reflecting on his childhood you can see that,0.13445838
come through in the film and in that as well some of the characters romanticized,0.042065296
so even though it's real and raw and tender these are people that have been,0.14877781
elevated in memory because when you look back on things things always just seem different,0.08649519
in memory and that's certainly not a negative critique if anything that's even more interesting,0.061892685
to see the filmmaker himself within his own film which is really unusual to see,0.07555532
it so intertwined in such a way like this film is Kuran exploring his own,0.15837769
memories of his own childhood so I think that's absolutely fascinating and the film Roma,0.0819277
