guys and continuing on in my series of billy wilder reviews in today's video i'll,0.061403766
be taking a look at the 1944 film considered one of his very best double,0.02464705
indemnity i killed dietrich me walden f insurance agent 35 years old unmarried no visible,0.46330896
scars until a while ago that is yeah i killed it i killed it for,0.61659735
money for a woman a rich woman and a calculating insurance agent plot to kill,0.5553993
her unsuspecting husband after he signs a double indemnity policy against a backdrop of distinctly,0.18677492
california settings the partners in crime plan the perfect murder to collect the insurance which,0.3658705
pays double if the death is accidental so double indemnity was released in 1944 and,0.15410842
this was the film that solidified billy wilder as a top tier director ever since,0.029834816
its release back then this was seen as an amazing film it broke a lot,0.03863187
of grounds and it was considered the first film the war which was a popular,0.037805714
genre especially throughout the 40s and 50s these very gritty black and white films usually,0.003176252
dealing within the criminal lifestyle and whether they can get away with murder or any,0.15786405
other extravagant crime or not usually shot in black and white the music is very,0.04042587
moody there's usually narration going on told in the point of view of one of,0.014579495
the criminals there's definitely a lot of tropes in the genre that originally started with,0.06693344
this movie and this was a movie that many people loved when it came out,0.045820512
and it was seen as a risk to make a movie like this as there,0.018493436
was a lot of production censorship codes that were going on at the time and,0.028084053
the censors didn't like movies told in the perspective of criminals because they believed that,0.036883105
was bad you shouldn't tell movies like this there was fears that a movie like,0.06320908
this would brainwash younger children and the following in their footsteps as silly as that,0.4840399
sounds but billy wilder and the crew were able to find ways to get around,0.024907136
the sensors tell a brilliant ending with a payoff that would make the sensors happy,0.047700986
while still making it work within the context of the story and make an effective,0.013761984
thriller that's just as effective and entertaining to watch today as it was back in,0.048426036
1944 this is the second time i have seen this movie the first time i,0.05240982
saw it was a few years ago when i caught it on turner classic movies,0.05011427
definitely respect them for helping me get into a wider assortment of cinema during my,0.036794633
teenage years this is the second time i have seen the film in full for,0.011453797
this director project and i think this is a great film this is the first,0.023917343
great film i would say that i've seen from billy wilder going through his filmography,0.07622805
in chronological order i think what he brings to the table both as a writer,0.025930189
with his very smartly detailed and written script along with the slick direction is very,0.023852155
top-notch i would say this is a prototype for sunset boulevard which spoiler alert i,0.048564393
think is an even better film the war i think that movie is absolutely insane,0.18729709
and it's one of the best written classic films i've ever seen in my life,0.06103193
and i'm excited to revisit that one again you can definitely see the prototype here,0.029063204
that led to an even better film i do enjoy the performances in double indemnity,0.17492934
fred mcmurray was definitely a risk too because apparently before he was cast in double,0.062046334
indemnity he mainly starred in a lot of romantic comedies but here he plays this,0.031212412
insurance man who conspires with another woman to commit a murder to collect the insurance,0.491705
yeah you wouldn't expect that that was definitely a risk and i think he made,0.039928313
it work i think he gave a good performance along with barbara stanwick as the,0.03509376
very conniving rich woman who cheats on her husband falls for this insurance guy and,0.29120293
they plan the perfect crazy murder crime parts of this movie feel like alfred hitchcock,0.5090253
at times i think hitchcock would have gone further and further into the madness of,0.2309347
the plot it's interesting because the whole murder plot happens like halfway into the movie,0.0951339
there's the build up in the first half and then there's the fallout in the,0.018533347
second half to see if they get away with it or not and i think,0.06930815
it was done in a very interesting structure i really respect billy wilder for doing,0.036328338
that because normally murder plots would happen far later into the film but here it's,0.09118271
done halfway into the film and it's a very suspenseful sequence to see if they,0.032932576
can pull this off or not to make it look like this death was an,0.1477792
accident instead of murder so they can get away with the insurance money and double,0.24151233
if it's an accidental death with the double indemnity clause and that makes the film,0.08974059
very suspenseful you also got edward g robinson in this film who plays the claims,0.051403396
manager at the insurance agency that fred mcmurray's character works for who is very much,0.026198259
on to this case and i greatly enjoy that with g robinson's performance he definitely,0.2072087
played against type 2 because edward g robinson was best known for starring in gangster,0.18057407
movies at the time and here he's actually the good guy in this film and,0.04412163
i thought that was very interesting and very refreshing and he pulled that off very,0.018697647
well too especially when he's paired alongside both barbara sandwick and fred murray when the,0.028720634
three are on together this movie electrifies in powerhouse performances and that witty script that,0.023373889
billy wilder brings to the table i'd say the only thing that brings double indemnity,0.22532351
down for me is even though i enjoy the performances even though i enjoy the,0.06514742
storytelling even though i love the direction and filmmaking i don't really find our two,0.025182523
main characters all that interesting even though i do think both are great actors i,0.030086922
do enjoy the performances i just cannot connect with fred's character or barbara sandlick's character,0.036628336
i think it's because they're both written to be very unlikable it's really hard finding,0.100308366
any sympathy or anything for any of these characters and why they're making these bad,0.049689885
decisions and i think even in some of the hitchcock movies even though some of,0.24088804
the characters that we follow are very unlikable there's still a little bit of sympathy,0.1107717
towards some of these characters and why they end up making some of these bad,0.055399153
decisions especially movies like in vertigo and psycho that comes to mind off the top,0.17256327
of my head here with double indemnity i just see two awful characters doing awful,0.14865458
things i'm just waiting for that to be bit in the butt in the end,0.47482702
here i just see these two characters i'm like i'm enjoying the storytelling but i'm,0.02766033
not connecting with any of these characters it's a movie that i love and admire,0.05132424
but it's not a personal favorite it doesn't impact me personally compared to some of,0.021386985
billy wilder's other films which i think are even better than this but double indemnity,0.22809698
was still a great start for a great career that spanned decades for this incredible,0.023040632
director this was definitely the first top-tier great film from billy wilder i enjoyed his,0.04035137
previous films particularly major in the minor and five graves of cairo but i didn't,0.028304895
love him i do really love double indemnity it's not a personal favorite there's definitely,0.12138604
this disconnect especially with some of our main characters but it's still incredibly directed i,0.029492248
love the performances i love the script i love the suspense i respect it for,0.03765405
being the benchmark to a whole genre that was so popular and prominent during that,0.011566878
time and it's still one of the finest films of that era in filmmaking and,0.027718203
i highly respect double indemnity for that alone i'm glad i revisited this one again,0.08338276
because it's such a really good film especially the script especially the suspense and especially,0.029095132
the performances in billy wilder's direction i definitely highly recommend this one if you want,0.029967854
a good introduction to the film the war genre this is definitely a great place,0.030571176
to start and then look up some of the other new wars of that time,0.060203113
and watch them as well this is definitely a great introduction for newbies of the,0.06523456
genre it's got billy wilder directing it he made a lot of great films and,0.06913453
this i'd say was the first really great film in his long-running filmography i'm gonna,0.07416399
give double indemnity a four and a half out of five stars and on the,0.02915633
hundred point scale it's getting an 84 out of a hundred so that wraps up,0.076086365
