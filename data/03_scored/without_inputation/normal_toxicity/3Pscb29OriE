aquafina in a dramatic role where she drives the story we know comedic actors can typically do drama really well how does she do taking this dramatically,0.095802546
The Farewell is a movie based on an actual lie,0.2804461
the story's about a Chinese family who finds out that their grandmother doesn't have long to live and they choose as that family to keep the news from her,0.15626454
so under the guise of a wedding they all come great in China to surround her and to be with her for one last time,0.15275247
this is a beautifully shot film from a 24,0.15271802
and it's their first movie that received a PG rating it's great to see the film rely so heavily on the story especially when it's very simple and pretty straightforward as an audience were exposed to this Chinese culture,0.063493714
and that was new to me but it was still really accessible,0.05752945
because down deep we all have family and we all have people that we care about,0.09956393
and so we were able to connect in ways regardless,0.07343263
if we understand the culture are familiar with it,0.053859048
now it was awesome to watch and I got to tell you that a lot of the food that they showed really made me hungry,0.141928
so when you watch us make sure you've already eaten otherwise you're gonna be upset for about 90 minutes until you can go chow down on something aquafina is billy the granddaughter and she is the lead of this film and she absolutely crushes it,0.14963509
and then she is just surrounded by a supporting cast who is spectacular,0.105907924
I mean they are all just genuine and human and so believable and that makes it really easy to relate and sympathize with them now while there is a fair amount of heavy drama to this,0.101151526
I mean because you it's surrounding the idea of death the filmmakers really sprinkle in just the right amount of humor at the right times to keep us from going into the bell jar but it's not like overly funny where you where you lose sight of the drama,0.27778435
I mean it's just that perfect balance,0.06737097
it's really easy to fall in love with a family because the interactions are genuine and heartfelt and they just feel so real,0.08451032
and we get to know them quirks and all as they just navigate this grief that they're going with and dealing with the the imminent death of their grandmother but also trying to keep that smile on their face so that she doesn't find out what's actually going on,0.24258438
now I know that seems a little bit weird and they expected to keep that secret from somebody that you are dying,0.41263884
the movie does a really good job of explaining it and putting us into that culture so that we do get a good understanding of why they would do that even though they may be struggling through it filmmakers also employ some really great imagery,0.08675966
I mean it's subtle but still really powerful,0.06856495
I think the simplicity of the story mixed with the complexity of the emotions,0.04757279
and the beliefs is really what makes this film stand out to me there were a few scenes that were funny but also touching as well I mean there's one that involves the family going to visit the grave of their grandfather and just that whole interaction and even leading up to them getting to the grave,0.16286317
just everything,0.04721784
that encompasses that and the dialogue that they're using is very powerful,0.041382477
but also has some great humorous moments to it,0.05833259
there's also a drinking game that goes on at a wedding and it is just like some jacked-up version of the funky chicken I have no idea what's going on but it's really funny,0.2101154
and then leads to a very emotional scene one other one is part that we see in a trailer and it's Aquafina learning,0.050173964
some exercise moves from her grandmother and just the interactions that they have how touching it is and still being able to be funny all the while and of course all of those add humor but they also do such a good job to draw us into the characters and into the story,0.09115744
now if I were gonna nitpick there were two shots that just kind of seemed to go on a little too long one's an exterior of a building,0.15353578
and the other is the cast walking and it looks like they're in a music video,0.10531397
it's just a slow-mo walk,0.44802627
and both of those just seem to sit on them a little too long even though they're great shots,0.22109905
but even if you were to trim them down you're only gonna save about 10 12 seconds at most so it's just it's negligent and it doesn't really matter,0.17593387
and again like I said that's only if I'm nitpicking and really trying to find something that I felt was even remotely wrong with the movie the relationships also are,0.06724694
so well executed,0.55551577
I mean they're grounded in reality and just so believable and you can see yourself in them,0.109970085
I mean I can see myself having one of these interactions or being part of this family just being sucked in to the drama that I'm seeing and then therefore the ride,0.44284642
I don't know what kind of distribution the film itself is gonna get,0.0749848
but you should take every opportunity you can to see the farewell,0.10074855
it is that good it's a perfect mix of drama and humor with a wonderful story in a spectacular cast there's no sex nudity or violence,0.5158793
but there is a little profanity,0.16853864
I give the farewell five out of five couches are you planning on seeing it,0.07473186
