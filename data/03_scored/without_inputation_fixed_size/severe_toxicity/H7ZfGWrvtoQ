eighth grade was directed by Bo Burnham and stars Elsie Fisher as young Kayla a,0.010889721
girl in her last week of eighth grade trying to survive because it's absolutely terrible,0.137548
and her life is painfully embarrassing and this is something that I think a lot,0.18764365
of kids and adults can relate to if they've ever been that shy kid in,0.035891313
class or the unpopular kid trying to reach out trying to make friends but it,0.04869876
takes a different approach to it than films you may have seen like this from,0.018684343
the 90s or early 2000s and so much of this film relies on our hero,0.03474454
young Kayla and Elsie Fisher gives a star-making performance here she's totally charming completely real,0.036482
and I basically loved everything that she brought to this movie I thought she was,0.065549195
so fantastic and the writing was also very realistic and very authentic for eighth graders,0.025173875
the film bridges the gap between acts by having her make a YouTube video and,0.02633861
we see a YouTube video in which she's talking about how to gain confidence or,0.044867966
something like that and then we see her dialogue overlaid over a sequence in which,0.03407004
we witness her trying to do something that she's talking about in her YouTube videos,0.06825849
and what I loved about that is that through those videos that she's making she's,0.09100976
trying to reach out she's trying to connect we never really get an idea of,0.032369167
if anyone's actually watching her channel that much except for one person in the film,0.04621962
who mentions it but despite wanting to create videos about things like confidence or how,0.03055255
to be yourself she has a really hard time doing that in real life which,0.09698444
I thought was an excellent commentary on modern-day social media I'm not sure if that's,0.021702947
what Bo Burnham was going for but it does feel like he's saying look at,0.024764122
all these people who are online telling us how to act or how to feel,0.058337934
but in everyday life they have no idea how to do it and I thought,0.03701348
that was really beautiful and the film captured it extremely well throughout the movie Kayla,0.013917637
would get opportunities to do things she wanted to do maybe she got invited to,0.028607553
a party or maybe she got to go out with some people a little bit,0.09655008
older than her and that excited her every single time something was looking up for,0.09575452
her in the back of my mind I'm thinking no it's about to crash and,0.18247518
burn this is so terrible I'm getting anxiety just watching this terrible flashbacks of eighth,0.10315535
grade oh my god and that's why the writing is so good because you always,0.045626275
feel like the Hammers about to drop on this poor girl you never really feel,0.19214162
like she's crawling out of this introverted and very embarrassing phase that she's in even,0.22260503
when things are kind of looking up for her her father portrayed by Josh Hamilton,0.014533597
in the film I thought was wonderful he has some beautiful scenes with her however,0.060252998
his character does sometimes feel almost too good to be true like so much of,0.02388342
the film feels very grounded and then he's just the best dad ever you could,0.014890136
possibly have ever and it just it just felt a little bit fantastical to me,0.04928013
but it wasn't something that took me out of the film it was just kind,0.028782496
of in retrospect looking back on how authentic everything else was he did feel sort,0.04657882
of like impossibly perfect and the film does follow a formula that we're used to,0.0095240995
seeing in films like this for instance there's a young boy that she has a,0.062089574
major crush on every time she sees him we get a close-up of his eyes,0.38551337
and some booming techno music which I thought was absolutely hilarious but there's also that,0.053835306
one kid who's really nice to her and in your head you're like yeah that's,0.24622959
the person you should be talking to you not this guy and we've seen that,0.08768584
many times in films before - but it's the wonderful writing the sharp comedy and,0.029874062
the commentary on today's youth that continue to make this film extremely entertaining it also,0.033620376
has a nerve-wracking scene in a car I saw this film with two of my,0.11286038
friends and I think we just held our breath for like five straight minutes it,0.1044192
was incredible extremely well done the film is definitely worth seeing it has great performances,0.019913603
