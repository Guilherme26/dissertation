so it's kind of nice to get back to reviewing a normal film,0.15063748
you know and especially a film like this which is of course the shape of water directed by Guillermo del Toro and man out I can tell you right now guys that I was so excited for this film you're my little Toro is one of my favorite directors working today you know he's on Hellboy crimson peak Pacific Rim and my favorite out of his filmography to date and this one might to be giving it a run for its money,0.09138531
but Pan's Labyrinth of course but yeah the shape of water,0.06567119
I was so excited for it like I said trailer hit,0.26158297
you know I as a trailer,0.07293995
it was it was good you know I kinda didn't really high me up but also excited to see that this movie was really doing well and you know in festivals and stuff like that and and really a happy four year more little Toro as well but yeah guys I'm obviously doing well festivals because it's a great movie and I can say that now I I highly recommend it for you guys right off the bat,0.09158049
please go see the shape hotter view not not seen it,0.24167363
yeah you know and if it's plane or near you cuz I know it's in stuff like cities and stuff like that but there's movies phenomenal guys it's just firm everything I tweeted out when I got home that you know everything from the cast,0.081609175
the cast was phenomenal to the score,0.052472193
so let's get a little bit into the cast,0.1284564
I think there has to be some Oscar nominations here for of course Sally Hawkins she was phenomenal in this film she was just really great,0.06576532
and she she does the whole ASL sign language thing,0.1005266
and she got kind of got a little bit backlash because I guess that community was like saying you know what they're not really portraying how we really doing stuff like that um but I'm not sure if excuse me if they really if they seen the film now like if it's the same or different,0.06179118
you know but for me she did a really good job for in the performance overall yeah and she was really good,0.0708077
so I think most likely I feel like they're gonna give her a nomination for that,0.06807598
but another like as always guys,0.09248146
Michael Shannon for me,0.08218803
it's just a phenomenal actor one of my favorite actors working today,0.057127602
and I feel like he's underrated I feel like he should have gotten nominated last year for nocturnal animals for Best Supporting Actor and yeah but he was phenomenal as the villain and man he they really do some some cool stuff with him,0.10251293
he kind of just embraces that whole villain like really good,0.331969
but same time in the movie I feel like he do something's different with him kind of making you kind of feel for him and kind of make him kind of bring him home and stuff like that you know,0.10560677
so you kind of couldn't tell what kind of life,0.23869435
he has you know at the same time,0.08791351
he kind of I loved that he kind of just pursues more he wants to be that that Top Gun,0.119993925
you know that top guy,0.10819258
and he's trying to you know,0.07719651
please is his a higher ups and stuff like that,0.14603451
but I yeah Micro Chanin he did a phenomenal job and another I feel like Michaels not gonna get nominated because Rick Richard Jenkins man he was just so good in this film you have to nominate him for Best Supporting Actor you know,0.099399365
he just did a phenomenal job,0.09789635
and he they did some really interesting things with his characters and you know normally water won't see normally I don't want to get into that little debate or their little topic,0.06524925
but yeah I was just surprised how that decided to go through what scared him bug me or any issues,0.1748713
okay cool,0.05487404
you know um you know you just don't expect that from like films,0.15818812
you know like they don't get that deep within these characters and their psyche and how they how they do things,0.08523131
and you know,0.056913033
and so really there was one scene in particular that I really liked him like,0.053728428
when that little moment happened again no spoilers my audience was like you know I was like,0.094098195
well you can kind of tell you know,0.092099115
and I really liked that moment too because it sets up you know his his character and the other person had to diner that's all I'm gonna say or yeah the diner,0.07170421
but I really liked that scene um but overall Richard ring is just knocks it out of the park in this Octavia Spencer,0.06423143
she just does her thing,0.102102384
you know I always feel like she's funny and everything but she you can kind of that's the thing about this movie that I can see the Octavia Spencer you know,0.11358563
she did her like role that she always liked,0.078863315
in supporting roles,0.037356436
she's funny and stuff like that like this earlier this year pretty sure she's been in a lot of stuff this year,0.1935858
but earlier this year she was in a gifted starring Chris Evans and I thought she was really good in that as well a little supporting role,0.075300686
but the thing about this film that for each character even those supporting characters,0.06362909
they have like a nice,0.048496526
I don't see arc but they have nice little character development moments and stuff like that and throughout the whole like first few scenes that Octavius was with Sally I'm forgetting their their names,0.075207315
I think one of them's Zelda I think in the other one was Lisa or something not sure I should remember these characters names but and I was even talking to myself about the movie on the way home and I never remember the names but now I'm just blanking but even in the beginning with those two characters you can kind of hear Octavia in the background whereas Ali's doing her thing she's in the background she's talking about her like husband stuff like that,0.071811736
and you know kind of can come full circle at the end,0.07721249
I was really nice to see you know but yeah and even Doug Jones I feel like he's just one of those actors,0.13108544
you don't really know that he's like in that role,0.17543663
but I think I think he did a great job for what it's worth,0.1417189
you know you can't really see that,0.09663882
he did a performance,0.085808344
like facial wise you know obviously,0.34603226
but overall you can kind of he did a great job,0.088102326
because of that like he was I was gonna say real quick to that,0.1332467
I don't know,0.14319348
I think he was he was in a practical suit I'm not sure that's another thing about this if they have like visuals effects like CGI,0.09506726
it was really great because I was just thinking it was real like a pr√°cticas a gear model,0.07186606
so obviously he that he uses real of practical effects and something,0.13939619
now he's he's uh okay I say how could I say he really likes using them um,0.2420829
so to been anything about her right now or it was like his suit yeah a little bit,0.31089434
I don't think it was,0.0683436
and that's amazing if it wasn't um but anyways Doug Collins did a pretty good job my gosh and like I said the whole cast I really liked the cast and their character so like that that's the thing characters you know that,0.07233456
uh so here,0.08238526
my little Toro we could talk about him,0.0877182
he's just phenomenal in this film,0.15379131
he doesn't started it,0.09128137
but he just he just knocked out of the park with everything was was the the story in in the way it's shot to Scimitar,0.19173664
if he's beautiful to score,0.10069158
I really noticed a score in this film and I believe his name is uh Alexandre de plus or another plus this flat,0.14892834
I think not sure how you spell he says that same but he didn't feel homage on this,0.14543183
I think he did some of the Harry Potter movies and he's worked with forgetting his name but he did move right a moon moonrise kingdom and he also did mr.,0.031768832
Fox phantom,0.12812763
mr.,0.059083447
fantastic,0.056152686
Fox,0.07015875
I think I'm forgetting the director's name,0.04492689
but he he's he's one of my favorites,0.15032324
but he the he the composer he'd that he's done a lot of good scores,0.08891098
and this was no different,0.07563705
so I've noticed score really early on to insert ography obviously garam also visually visually you know he focus on visuals as well you can tell his previous films um,0.09629053
but in this film I think you know,0.095666975
sometimes I gotta say that he kind of gets to carry to wait a little bit with visuals,0.17554653
maybe that's what it's like Pacific Rim,0.06328211
I enjoyed Pacific room I own it but a lot of people say you know it's kind of not up there for in his films but yeah guys I just overall,0.21113081
I don't know what else to say about the movie the the the score was great scimitar feel directing the cast the story itself I had a great time at the theater,0.08216716
that's something I kind of didn't really expect you know from this these movies is I love watching movies and these could have been ways for me like more Oxford,0.11591162
ish movies I guess they're really great films and stuff like that but you don't find yourself at theatre kind of like having fun,0.15416454
I guess unless because these are more like darker films and so like the more more serious films I should say more drama driven films but this one was a little bit different I was having fun following these characters in this journey and stuff so overall guys if I had to rate the shape of water,0.085485876
I think I have to give it an 8.5 out of 10,0.07905425
it was just a really great movie,0.052188437
I I seems like I'm giving a lot of movies 8.5 um this year looking like when I look back at my scores but there's just one scene a real quick that kind of just kind of came out of nowhere for me,0.09989198
you know,0.07163658
and in you kind of involving like some singing,0.15149422
I just thought there was a lot of great stuff little cared little character details and stuff like that a lot of great stuff in a movie you know with the Richard Jenkins character and his painting,0.058554802
it's just a lot of stuff,0.099754944
I really loved about this movie but I don't know I just feel like at the end of the day like I I just didn't really kind of I don't know III I'm thinking about that scene way too much,0.089159325
but just that scene kind of took me out you know in,0.11880887
so I think that's a good score in my opinion,0.061762415
it's one of my favorites of the year,0.05244405
so yeah if you guys not checked out this movie again I highly recommend it,0.1228756
