it sounds preposterous on screen it is poetry Guillermo del Toro's film is fantastical gorgeous nutty and so moving that I wept del Toro has a frenzied fiercely original imagination his worlds are populated by magical creatures with a propensity for both great good and jaw-dropping evil,0.24060896
but even the most awful are fully realized and utterly fascinating here that character is Colonel Richard Strickland a power-hungry sadistic government official played by Michael Shannon Strickland armed with an electric cattle prod enjoys torturing the creature who reciprocate Spy biting his fingers after that the creature who was found somewhere in the jungles of the Amazon is chained,0.5002063

I also enjoyed the wonderful Richard Jenkins Octavia Spencer and Michael Stuhlbarg who plays a Russian spy and of course Shannon who's Colonel Strickland is a villain so contorted and torture himself that you all post want to help with a hug and therapy the shape of water is obviously inspired by Creature from the Black Lagoon also a story set during the Cold War of a half-man half-fish creature,0.1840861
