singing in the rain directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donnan starring Gene Kelly Donald,0.068926975
O'Connor Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen is a 1952 musical that follows the career of,0.07259477
Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown to lifelong friends that go into the movie business during,0.08237382
the silent age of Hollywood but now during the advent of sound pictures they must,0.03704179
adapt or die all the while being dragged down by Lina Lamont a silent aged,0.4762523
film star with a terrible voice who threatens to ruin all of their careers singing,0.46549472
in the rain is one of those movies that I hadn't seen yet even though,0.05383872
it's always at the top of the greatest musicals ever made lists and all these,0.059294034
other things and you hear about it all the time I just hadn't seen it,0.057279963
because frankly while I enjoy current-day style musicals where the songs are a key part,0.06940419
of the storytelling old musicals old Hollywood musicals tend to just have these musical numbers,0.07293038
that come out of nowhere mean nothing take forever and while they might be visually,0.18970646
interesting have cool choreography they're pointless and so they feel annoying and and like a,0.53490317
huge waste of time after watching this movie the one thing that is abundantly clear,0.18625416
is the fact that this movie is carried almost entirely by the actors the actors,0.09064881
are the heart and soul of this movie Gene Kelly does an amazing job as,0.056852676
this hyper popular really famous film star who is in all the big movies and,0.088538386
he just has this charm about him in every scene whether he's pretending to be,0.1279277
acting or whether he's just talking to people or he's feeling down it doesn't matter,0.11820134
what the scenario is he is so charming and so instantly likeable and lovable it's,0.27482334
just incredible his performance Donald O'Connor is interesting too because he plays the best friend,0.06625528
of Gene Kelly and he is really a supporting role he doesn't have much of,0.09840942
an arc he doesn't have a whole lot to offer in terms of the story,0.080180004
but in terms of what he brings to the film is a lot I mean,0.0554194
he brings this hyper amazing energy like every scene he is in he elevates it,0.15275998
by a lot I mean he is so charismatic and so energetic and so excited,0.19149968
to be part of every scene he's in Debbie Reynolds is our main female lead,0.28809726
in the movie does a really great job whenever I see a female character in,0.10017986
a movie from the 50s or earlier I always have to really reset my expectations,0.061366692
for what characters are gonna be like because back then a lot of female characters,0.15152954
were just cardboard cutouts but in this movie we get a sense of her wants,0.16202869
desires her frustrations you know she feels like a more well-rounded character than I honestly,0.18126468
would have expected for the time period so it's surprising and she does a really,0.065195024
good job with her character she sings amazing her physicality in terms of the way,0.1292346
she moves and dances and stuff is amazing as well she just does a really,0.09267352
really good job and she is just pitch perfect for the part and then Jean,0.1568384
Hagen who plays our de-facto villain in the movie who is this over pampered starlet,0.2423165
who gets everything she wants and is hyper demanding she has this hyper screechy awkward,0.44421235
accent / voice and the entire plot of the movie is about how awful her,0.4032371
voice is that's the entire plot of the movie and so if that didn't work,0.09333694
though movie would have fallen apart and it works beautifully because the first time I,0.08119547
was watching the movie and I saw her talk for the first time it correctly,0.09731289
made me go ah your voice is terrible so when the whole plot revolves around,0.49264616
everyone trying to hide her voice from the public so they don't find out how,0.11894556
terrible her voice is as an actress it you buy it all the way as,0.6855354
a musical we of course have to talk about some of the musical numbers oh,0.035390075
man the physicality on display by the actors here and the dancers here is in,0.13740844
sane this is some of the most impressive dancing I've ever seen in a movie,0.08772146
ever choreography is ridiculous and the execution of that choreography is even more ridiculous these,0.8606264
are these are incredibly long takes of really complicated movements with multiple characters interacting with,0.1506188
each other and strict timing I mean it's just unbelievable every scene is so complicated,0.1179792
and they're all executed with such precision it's it's a wonder to behold I think,0.44306156
by far my favorite musical number was good morning which was a trio number with,0.051503334
Gene Kelly Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and they are all doing these complicated movements,0.13942614
they're dancing together they're arm and arm they're like dancing upstairs and downstairs and using,0.11810877
props left and right and just oh it's crazy and it has so much character,0.40324908
to it and so well done like they're going from room to room it's um,0.09041938
it's unbelievable Donald O'Connor's big number is make him laugh which is this incredibly physical,0.31089434
dance number where he's flipping over props and he's like getting up and falling down,0.1488654
on the floor and you know he does it with so much energy and so,0.050760996
much character and he's flipping upside down over walls and like wow man Wow it's,0.16438353
unreal as I'm watching it I'm thinking okay he's he's got to stop like it's,0.31016538
gotta go down like he's got to start winding this down and it just keeps,0.2722481
ratcheting up to another level and going and going going and the energy is insane,0.24134511
Broadway melody I have to mention because it's in the tail end of the movie,0.08923994
and I think and the tail end of the movie there's more musical numbers that,0.049301025
are more irrelevant they feel longer they feel more stretched out and while there's interesting,0.16356668
things happening in them it does feel a little overwrought but there's two parts of,0.11409425
the Broadway melody that are so interesting and so beautiful and cool that I have,0.054202005
to mention them there's this sexy dance between Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse where she's,0.40315554
wearing this green dress and she's dancing around him and they basically play out an,0.10573086
entire intimate relationship in a dance and like the power on display of the physicality,0.18632811
of both Gene Kelly and said Cherie says she's jumping into his arms and he's,0.20218374
lifting her up or dipping her flipping her around and it is really impressive just,0.1577346
the physicality of that dance and the sensuality of that dance is something else the,0.112147875
other part of the Broadway melody is the melody ballet which is just insane it's,0.24106054
this really long segment where Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse are dancing but Cyd Charisse,0.123355955
has this shawl this like white scarf thing that's just draping forever behind her it's,0.3504572
just it it's incredibly beautiful it's long takes these long long takes of them dancing,0.2618877
like this and it just looks so unwieldy and difficult to film that I can't,0.08101931
imagine how many takes it would have taken to get that right I mean wow,0.05666516
it was impressive it was just unbelievable i watch that and I think they would,0.08999689
never do that today like Dave if they were gonna do that scene they would,0.098567165
do this the entire shawl of CGI because they would not want to deal with,0.124771684
the headache of trying to get that to work practically but back then they didn't,0.04801453
have a choice and I mean to have the the khones to go for it,0.061316375
it's crazy it's crazy but the the results speak for themselves it's beautiful I mean,0.3373148
this movie is so fun like it's funny to like the comedy in this movie,0.14957082
is is real I was laughing out loud at a lot of the jokes the,0.06933927
character dynamics are so good and it's just this hyper real world the colors are,0.08090799
bright and lively and everybody in this world seems to be loving what they're doing,0.06484975
in life and and nobody seems down-and-out nowadays there's so many films that are so,0.10305307
cynical and so dark and but this just has a really refreshing beautiful air about,0.24172187
it my final rating for singing in the rain is going to be a 10,0.07396977
out of 10 there's really nothing to complain about the the musical numbers as they,0.05509252
are are really good the characters are great the story is simple but well-executed and,0.20149153
funny I mean this is just a great movie and I I think everyone should,0.124460414
watch this one cuz I can't imagine there'd be many people who hate this movie,0.21419518
