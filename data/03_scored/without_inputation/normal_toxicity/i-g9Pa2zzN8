it's well back again,0.06963989
and today's view is the fantasy drama film the shape of water co-written and directed by Guillermo del Toro the shape of water takes place in the 1960s and primarily follows Sally Hawkins character Eliza Esposito Eliza works as a janitor at a Research Center in Baltimore and begins interacting with the strange creature,0.098183334
that's being studied by medical professionals,0.11423384
at the research center as time passes Eliza finds herself at odds with the scientists and government officials as she begins getting attached to the creature,0.12959208
and the rest of the film spent watching their friendship evolve,0.08550514
as the government attempts to simply understand what this animal was alright,0.26096895
so I can't exactly say I was looking forward to the shape of water,0.054900926
I mean I definitely wanted to see it because it's guillermo del toro but it wasn't something that I was like dying to see you know like when the trailers came out,0.104027025
I was interested in it,0.06944963
I wasn't blown away by what I saw in those trailers,0.08097329
I didn't feel like I had to rush out and see it but like I said since Guillermo del Toro's name was attached to it,0.037460525
I felt like I kind of had to see it,0.09418662
and I saw the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes like I said don't I don't ever read reviews beforehand but I do look at scores a lot of times because you know I don't get any early access to these movies I see him most the time the same time,0.15271263
do you guys do really I was so really disappointed with this one I was very disappointed with the shape of water because it feels if I feel like I had no emotion to it,0.0848757
I felt no connection to the characters and it wasn't really entertained,0.051938653
it was just kind of a very boring movie and that's probably gonna be upsetting to a lot of different people out there who probably loved this film but it was very boring,0.14923473
I found myself checking my my watch on my phone a lot just because I just felt like there was nothing really happening,0.09699918
it felt like I wasn't engaged in the story like things were progressing but it eventually just kind of felt like a collection of scenes kind of you know mashed all together into this force kind of awkward romance story,0.07255876
and that's you know,0.061250042
it is unique,0.06899701
it's a very unique movie,0.073932275
and I think that will resonate with some people this love story,0.064660154
it's a very unique very different type of love story very different type of romance story than what you've probably ever seen before or at least very different from what you've seen before,0.073685184
and that's cool that Guillermo del Toro took that direction,0.07845996
but you still kind of gotta have you know good character,0.08088112
and the story that's actually entertaining and you know makes sense to me this story doesn't make sense,0.055801224
there's a lot of things that happen to feel very forced like I said it feels like the romance is the biggest part of the story and they make sure that happens,0.052177027
no matter which direction the characters are going,0.061537676
and no matter which direction things are headed,0.0746534
and when it comes to the entertainment factor,0.08013088
that's a really really big issue,0.13044827
for a movie like this,0.09758058
I mean any movie really I mean there's a lot of things that movies can try to do they can try to help you learn something help you feel something,0.07792723
but entertainment is the primary focus for a lot of films,0.1112798
and this film is not an exclusion from that,0.10283029
and it's not a very entertaining movie like,0.11019113
I said I was very very bored,0.07236873
this is by a lot of people considered one of the best movies of 2017 and for me it's one of the worst because it was so boring,0.1617244
there was like I said there was no engagement no attachment for me,0.07892487
it felt like a very hollow experience very hollow and like I didn't care about anything,0.11885666
I didn't care about the characters,0.07891333
I didn't care about anything that was happening that was going on in this story and that's a big problem because if you're feeling that way and you're feeling that cold towards the story and towards the characters that's that speaks volumes for how much you're enjoying the movie because if you're not you're not engaged in that way you know you're not doing much,0.05535581
and it's not like I'm a huge Guillermo del Toro fan of his that I've seen is actually Pan's Labyrinth,0.1244598
I don't think,0.102524914
I've seen any other his films,0.20097315
I mean I have to go down his IMDB page and check but I was more interested in his work because he has that kind of credibility as a director a lot of people consider him to be one of the best a lot of people love his work and love his films,0.1961555
and I think expectations were very high for this movie,0.07710268
and that maybe that could be why people are judging it so favorably,0.056757465
I don't know maybe they actually enjoyed it,0.14945678
this wasn't a movie that when I went out to see you today that I was going out there and really hyped really excited to see it sound like I was going to see Star Wars or Avengers or even a trail that really wowed me like moonlight or lala land last year arrival,0.07696381
those movies were movies,0.09133442
I was really excited to see going into the shape of water,0.0648339
not so much I mean like I was going into it expecting it to be good,0.11040175
I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as I thought it was but I didn't expect it to be great either because I feel like the trailer their story just didn't act with me,0.08504367
I didn't feel any sort of emotion from the trailer,0.05831949
I didn't I felt cold like I did throughout the entire movie and besides a few scenes I think a lot of the reason or the biggest reason that I felt so cold was because there's no build up to it,0.04996078
there's no build up,0.06377592
tinea scenes things just happen things just happen like so the collection of scenes that lead to events that are in the script and they have to be there,0.053640544
that's how this feels to me it feels very contrived and that's a big problem for a movie that's you know supposed to entertain me and supposed to make me my heart warm basically I'm supposed to have a heart warming to an extent experience from this because it is a romance story,0.08783847
it's a romance story,0.049659383
it was sold as romance story,0.047092024
it is it's a very odd one but it is that and that may be part of the problem too I mean it's a romance story like I said and the romance is between a sea fish monster and a woman and it just feels weird it just feels weird and like I can't really connect to the story no matter how much outcasts,0.16672666
they are how abused they've been how neglected they've been in society,0.31089434
or you know wherever this wherever they've been that didn't really change,0.11345053
the fact that I couldn't get invested in their relationship,0.07393293
I couldn't get invested in their evolving relationship,0.061597757
and that was something that you know is gonna if you can't either if you feel like this movie is gonna be too weird for you and you're not gonna be able to get invested in this unusual romance to say the least and you're not gonna enjoy this movie,0.116612315
I'm guessing a big reason people really enjoy this film,0.117620915
or some of the critics really enjoy of this film is because of the characters the characters are outcasts almost all of them,0.095828205
and they all interact and identify with each other in unique and outcasts like ways they've all kind of been shunned by society in some way they all kind of feel unaccepted or unappreciated in some way,0.15987782
and that's something that does resonate throughout this story and that kind of identifies and goes with the creature that Sally Hawkins character you know has a romantic connection with because they're similar in that way but it's just it's just weird,0.16037741
I think if you're really into artsy really unique films which I am to an extent then you probably will enjoy this,0.15507457
I think this is very specific to a very specific crowd very film,0.1241527
buff,0.03725017
very hardcore movie lovers artsy film lovers,0.24151589
those kind of those kind of crowds,0.15273009
that's this movie is going to appeal so and otherwise if you're not in that crowd I think you won't like it,0.16406508
but there are a few things I liked about this film,0.09460484
I mean the shape water does have some redeeming qualities,0.09523167
I mean I think sally hawkins is really great in her role as Eliza,0.15074453
I think she's probably the best thing going for this film I liked her character the most but I was more impressed by the performance I mean this is a very difficult role to pull off considering,0.062031772
Eliza is a mute,0.3126216
she has to speak through sign language,0.102345966
she has to relate a lot of emotion to her facial expressions and body language,0.24059112
and just general tone without actually speaking anything,0.08226499
that's a very tough role to take on very difficult role to take on not a lot of actresses could do that role,0.085081786
and I thought she pulled it off really really well,0.103533395
Michael Shannon is also really great,0.067275174
he's great in a different kind of way he's intense very creepy,0.35685292
it's a very Michael Shannon s kind of role I plays a government official,0.08504027
and he's very serious about this asset this creature,0.30718008
I thought he was really great to him and Sally Hawkins were great activity Octavia Spencer was also really good,0.08595857
she was good as well,0.11229758
so the acting is good,0.07024921
it's just weird to me that I liked all the performances but I hated all the characters even the good guys and the bad guys I hate I didn't like either didn't connect with either of them that's kind of weird that so that's a rarity for me,0.14452536
and I think I can you know most people can separate,0.05821095
the difference between a good performance and a good character or bad performance and a bad character here good performances bad characters,0.09528164
that's kind of how I do it the movie also looks cool,0.09207367
I mean the CGI looks cool,0.09496506
there's a lot of really slow-mo shots a lot of pans and zooms a lot of great cinematography work a lot of interesting,0.44536883
lighting lighting efforts letting work in this film it's a very pleasant,0.10045988
very easy film to look at it has that 1960s vibe and feel and tone to it visually visually this film looks great a lot of underwater shots that look we're really really cool very artistic looking it's a very easy film to look at just not a very easy film to engage with emotionally,0.13228054
alright,0.048265677
there's one more bad thing,0.119741246
I have to say about the shape of water,0.064365976
so the ending the ending is very out,0.15237996
there like the rest of the film but it makes no sense,0.08117723
I was very confused and very frustrated but not surprised because the rest of the movie kind of does the same thing,0.07726361
and it very much left me underwhelm very cold,0.1505601
I walked to that theatre very disappointed that was you know the whole movie kind of felt that way to me,0.088239886
but the ending was just you know the icing on the cake as for the pros cons though the shape of water had very nice acting performances from Sally Hawkins Octavia Spencer and Michael Shannon they were all really good and it looks cool the visual experience is very nice CGI looks cool the cinematography the lighting all looks very good as for the cons the story was very uninteresting,0.066922046
it lacked emotional resonance and didn't have much of an entertainment factor,0.0681616
the pacing was a little bit of a mess there were a lot of collections of scenes no build-up not not much tension to experience,0.15316625
in this film the ending was very anticlimactic,0.1620061
and the characters as a whole were also very very underwhelming,0.19044298
I'm gonna give the shape of water,0.07356433
a 4.5 out of 10 I know that's very disappointing to hear for a lot of you,0.2406777
and I'm gonna recommend that you pass on this one in theaters,0.1535938
you might want to see it,0.088918194
if you love Guillermo del Toro and you're just looking for a very out-there romance story but otherwise for most audience members the vast majority of you I feel like you could really pass on this one,0.063326046
so did you guys see the shape of water,0.07732224
yet what did you think of it,0.07024921
and if not let me know why not,0.08687734
and also let me know your favorite gear,0.063097745
mando Toro film I guess mine would be Pan's Labyrinth,0.09319085
