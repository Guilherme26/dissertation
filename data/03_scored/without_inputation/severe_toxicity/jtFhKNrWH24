Thor Ragnarok I'm gonna give it a good I'm gonna be the bad I'm gonna,0.09417071
be the nerdy so I'm not gonna spoil everything about the movie but I will,0.28971148
talk into detail about some of the plots in the movie so that could be,0.02142091
seen as spoilers I did a video earlier this week where I actually went to,0.02026216
the Thor Ragnarok premiere and I gave a little mini review at the end of,0.037179776
that video about how I felt about the movie in general so if you want,0.057116657
no spoilers I would recommend checking out that I would actually just recommend checking out,0.04971915
the video in general because Tessa Thompson may or may not be in it just,0.047722936
sayin and someone may or may not have met her just sayin I also love,0.042225856
the fact that I saw this movie incredibly early and yet I'm still one of,0.035834108
the last people to actually review it on YouTube it's even earlier that I see,0.07414736
a movie though later I review it I'm terrible at this I should just quit,0.06303879
I'm not gonna quit I can never quit you no matter what your comment say,0.028863648
what can I say about Thor Ragnarok let me point this out to you and,0.04037199
I mean this as a positive compliment let's say you took your favorite Saturday morning,0.019855732
cartoon from the 80s and 90s and you said okay Saturday morning cartoon I know,0.06230975
you're cheap and just made to sell toys but what if I gave you a,0.12120245
good director a good script and a good budget to do whatever you want and,0.017850203
make an awesome movie but still like a Saturday morning cartoon that's the Ragnarok this,0.04677638
movie is so freaking fun if I feel like Laura Ragnarok finally embraces and accepts,0.15445897
the world that it's in feel like now that we've gotten past the dark world,0.11205617
and Garn is the galaxy and dr. strange that now Marvel is like let's go,0.049445096
all out with magic and creatures and powers and all this stuff and thor ragnarok,0.1442444
just fully embraces that and it's fun i mean this is the kind of stuff,0.06589841
that i would have loved to see more of in the other two movies because,0.025866332
i feel like it was kind of holding back a little bit whereas now it's,0.04684556
like BAM just put it all out there you can definitely get a guardians of,0.051023576
the galaxy vibe from this movie like it clearly watch that movie and when mm-hmm,0.031700656
that's what Thor needs to do guys that's what the word he used to do,0.018198093
and a lot of it has to do with the direction tygo ytt is an,0.026749695
amazing director this movie handles a lot of different plots in subject matters some more,0.024116898
on a light-hearted comedic side and some on the darker dramatic side and he found,0.05945744
a way to take something like this with these different elements and still always make,0.024473436
it feel like one movie but when it is funny oh my gosh - the,0.052091863
movie is hilarious and again I want to point out the reason why I think,0.052130442
it's it's funny good is because it's funny in the natural element of the story,0.027444812
and the comedy came more from the characteristics of the characters in the movie and,0.015508757
what they were saying is their characters as opposed to like Marvel stand-up and we've,0.049483676
seen Marvel's standup you know what I'm saying this one I think they really fleshed,0.044031166
out Thor better they put a little bit more humor into him and they had,0.06391816
him really showcased a little bit more than just being I'm a god and I,0.091861196
can fight things Loki of course is up in this everyone loves Loki he's in,0.059482053
top form as always but the whole Thor I hope dynamic of course Thor ends,0.038639855
up in this tournament and he has to fight the Hulk meanwhile Hulk is in,0.046371948
this weird state where he can't change back to Bruce Banner and Thor has to,0.05042092
kind of help him out with that the dynamic of those two almost are to,0.02066526
feel like a buddy cop film we got to see a little bit more of,0.06298956
Hope in this movie I still kind of wish that some of these elements could,0.038597282
have led itself into a solo Hulk film but if this is what we got,0.0380791
to do to get the Incredible Hulk more on-screen and to see more of him,0.032190897
and establish that cared a little bit more I thought I did it in a,0.061723057
really good way and we got ourselves a good Marvel villain I really really like,0.074102126
Cate Blanchett as hella in this now warning here's where some spoilers come in so,0.118290275
hella is this evil goddess and we find out that not only is she evil,0.32702476
but she also happens to be related to Thor she's actually Thor's sister Odin's daughter,0.1465852
her and Odin used to be back in the day just crazy warriors taking over,0.34315935
other worlds just causing all kinds of damage and destruction as warriors and then of,0.21732016
course Odin was like well I got kids now so I can't do that no,0.15100268
more we're done and hella still wants to do it and oh it is all,0.0826943
like none not only are we done but since you still want to do it,0.025219772
I'm have to banish you you gotta go and I gotta say man I don't,0.24046318
really like Odin took this movie for me to really go you know what oh,0.12966758
it is kind of the big you know like he said some nice things the,0.023693841
word Loki - have a love for him because he's the father I get it,0.074040264
but he banished Thor in a moment Thor got cocky about being a warrior which,0.21967025
is the past of Asgard in itself he adopted Loki but never told Loki the,0.023985857
full story to where he always felt resentful of Thor because he was true Sun,0.047838014
and Loki was adopted son and now we got hella this daughter that was side,0.15343525
by side and battling him and then one day he just changed his mind and,0.08087635
then gonna try to tell her she's wrong for doing what they were already doing,0.09984207
before it's like when you were smoker and you're a drinker and you stop and,0.3722466
then you started point out other people would stop smoking this time dream like hey,0.059067644
you were there with me Oh didn't you got some issues man it's another one,0.06454211
these complicated father relationships as Marvel Cinematic Universe if you're looking for the dramatic dark,0.03551349
stuff in Thor Ragnarok it all comes from hell she is not a jokester she,0.18127584
is not doing any one-liners her one mission is I am pissed off at Asgard,0.21319668
I am pissed off and Odin I'm pissed off and Thor and everybody in my,0.30790797
path got to die and I mean that literally like for a movie that's got,0.31362575
some wacky funny jokes in it there's some straight-up like just mean death and like,0.38393867
even with characters that you know like people that have been in the Thor storyline,0.027023086
for a couple of movies literally just walking on the screen to go hey what's,0.040471103
that remember me sick don't even show up she just disappeared she wasn't even in,0.17632222
the movie but everybody else in that crew you know that crude authorities hang out,0.044555333
with they are in this movie for like five seconds hell is like yeah you're,0.23709922
right now yep yep Callen just was a straight-up clean house of characters for the,0.017751755
Marvel Cinematic Universe and then Karl Urban's there and he's all like don't kill me,0.2751337
she's like great will you the executioner now I'm a command here to kill other,0.5714334
people he's like seriously I just got here he just elbows gotta go into hiding,0.06896358
em dogs gotta like take off his big old crown and get away from the,0.5104355
the open date there the mariokart road and just be like in the for somewhere,0.03385718
like let me go wait I'm gonna stay alive because black panels coming up in,0.47856006
February honey if you can't make myself get a cameo don't kill me hella as,0.2757112
the worst aegis elbow impression by the way thank you very much but enough about,0.09237738
hella oh my gosh uh Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie good lord uh what can I,0.19769457
say I love her I love everything about her the moment she walks on screen,0.05423442
she is great she is strong she is powerful she is awesome but she is,0.028844358
also flawed because she is an alcoholic very first scene that you see her is,0.22878253
she's like what's up I'm here to fight yeah Wow okay that's an entrance her,0.11062137
character is just so amazing and so cool when there's all these cool shots of,0.040499043
her when she's walking and like explosions are happening when hotter like he's a freakin,0.5559032
Power Ranger she's just amazing man I just really liked her and then she has,0.037666023
this incredible backstory about her and this army of women warriors you get this backstory,0.17997275
or this is his flashback where heard a bunch of warriors of fighting hella and,0.12337161
their own freaking flying unicorns and horses of whatever and helis throwing stuff in the,0.47457406
air and it's all in slow motion and it's got these different effects I'm telling,0.032935902
you it feels like a Saturday morning cartoon with a budget and there's a whole,0.07981273
point of the movie where I'm like I need that movie like entirety like I,0.034180462
need more of that like can we just strip that out make a prequel film,0.11862885
or sideways movie and give me that I'm telling that shot oh man that was,0.14579828
so cool you know a lot of people always talk to rag on DC and,0.10690499
stuff but I'm gonna say man I feel like Marvin might've saw one woman I,0.088386945
was like yeah we were gonna cut that scene but I think now we're gonna,0.08833506
leave it in you you're right tiger look at this let's hold on to that,0.031666733
she's awesome she's just really I just I can't say enough about her she's just,0.080139995
a really cool character one of the strongest female Marvel hero that we've seen in,0.069749825
some time and again hopefully when she gets back on that ship again she could,0.04145624
take a trip to her condo just be like hey what's up I brought him,0.06722479
go with me to Falcon is riding shotgun war machine flew behind us Peter picked,0.23018822
up sand data from spider-man homecoming we all here go boom it's all I say,0.048562396
if you like go bloom you're gonna get some Goldblum in this gold boom is,0.057744592
at full Goldblum in this movie it's Grandmaster right cuz I keep want to call,0.059988923
him taskmaster for some reason but it's Grandmaster I also love that kind of turn,0.0546455
a little bit in Jeff go boom when I try to explain that you hear,0.048486568
me go uh a grandmaster if you know Jeff Goldblum and you know how Jeff,0.06491195
Goldblum is and that's the Jeff Goldblum you want to see thor ragnarok deliveries but,0.02709027
there's his new character Korg I really liked him and I found out later that,0.039284416
the director Tycho martyt was the voice of him he was really funny too I,0.02323553
really liked that character a lot he's trying to start this whole resistance and that,0.028749902
leads into Thor wanting to start his own group of superheroes called lore Avengers what,0.09386406
I thought was really cute and then even the ending of this movie man it,0.1444413
was not what I was expecting you know I had a whole idea what was,0.029068526
gonna go down and then I was like oh okay I mean you won but,0.10634757
that was a surprise his movie is just full escapism at its finest it's not,0.03642479
trying to connect what it's saying in a movie two things are happening in the,0.014910092
real world except for maybe a little subtle metaphor about immigration all the way down,0.06527048
to a song called immigrations on this movie issues all about going in shutting off,0.13303074
the rest of the world being in this fantasy world seeing all the action seeing,0.06997399
Thor fight scene Factory fight see and hope though crazy seeing all these action and,0.112888984
colors and and powers and all that kind of stuff this is a pure escape,0.037264254
film and you know what there's nothing wrong with that this feels like the types,0.039507918
of movies that they were trying to make as action films back in the day,0.02401313
but they just didn't have the budget or the story or no one cared enough,0.016010305
to try to make it good like seriously I want everybody that worked on Thor,0.048709404
Ragnarok to now make a Masters of the Universe movie like if y'all could do,0.05109941
he-man like you do Thor I would be a happy happy person and then get,0.1160925
on Thundercats while you're at it and SilverHawk to the finish of the trilogy now,0.027138162
for the bad like I said this movie is super super funny so funny though,0.0635124
that sometimes the more dramatic stuff kinda doesn't have as much strength as it should,0.031650767
it's really good stuff and an instrumenting stuff and what I do like about the,0.024418892
movie is that when it does get into some of the more heavier stuff usually,0.024276542
with hella it does kind of stop the jokey jokes it really makes it clear,0.073594585
this is bad and this needs to be stopped but I think that in a,0.043534275
movie that maybe wasn't as humorous that might have had a little bit more weight,0.07881029
to it than it does in this movie the tournament stuff it makes sense why,0.025418663
that super humorous and fun and action-packed because it's a tournament of Fighters and it's,0.112008944
the crazy world is and you got Jeff Goldblum what do you expect but the,0.055427756
hell of stuff I think is something that's also very good too in a different,0.11694926
way as much as I like it and as good as it is in this,0.049391218
movie in a weird way I kind of do wish it was a movie or,0.08762531
a character that got established in earlier Thor movies and luckily like I said with,0.019717373
the direction they were able to make it all seamlessly feel like the same movie,0.021753501
but I feel like there's something they could have done more with hella they really,0.072904795
kind of introduced this whole storyline because her story is interesting and her reason for,0.021096965
doing what she's doing is not only these cases with a villain kinda has a,0.076108314
point I was doing something that I was told was okay and right for so,0.030683592
long then all of a sudden I'm wrong and I'm banished so therefore I got,0.086791165
some vengeance to take out and I can respect that I mean I'm not saying,0.14497611
I side with the villain I'm just saying that I kind of get where she's,0.09452193
coming from a little bit so to see her story kind of go from start,0.053760808
to finish in this movie you know I wished that she was like Loki where,0.09574321
we would have met her early and we could have seen the progression of her,0.029494243
and her vengeance or anger towards Thor towards Odin along the way maybe there would,0.14725304
have been a moment where Loki and hella kind of teamed up and worked together,0.072391935
and then hella getting to a point where even look he was like I can't,0.06967267
roll with that and that could have been interesting you know for all that time,0.027596474
we spent with them elves that we're never gonna see again and Thor the dark,0.040646046
world that could have been a moment to be like hella could have been a,0.08639804
part of that you know that's what I'm saying I think maybe the second movie,0.021434877
could introduce or has something to do with hella that could have culminated to this,0.06201507
movie dealing with that as well as a tournament because I feel like that she,0.07422651
was a great villain that we're now kind of done with maybe who knows you,0.108124934
know Marvel will always find a way they need to bring her back but look,0.07646153
like she's pretty done like I said Schiff was nowhere to be found they don't,0.07363184
even explain why she's gone and Jane Foster Natalie Portman dang talked about just give,0.089981385
it up on something you had two movies where you made pretty much a large,0.04918035
part of the movie about Thor pretty much leaving his life to be with this,0.033739444
one woman that he loves so much and the third movie that he's like yeah,0.11215595
they broke up and that's it and it's not even for Mike lore or Loki,0.046851546
it's from like some fan some random person comes up the doors like oh you're,0.050439544
Thor can I take a picture by the way sorry did your girlfriend broke up,0.12913808
with you by I'm like that's it that's how you Andale somebody's you forced me,0.12976004
to watch you made me sit through that for two movies for the third movies,0.06233303
go yeah that's over why couldn't Ella meet her be like hey let's not Natalie,0.07268528
Portman yeah nothing that's wrong that's nice wrong that I shouldn't want Jane Foster dead,0.14362845
that's a really terrible thing to say but it'd be pretty cool Dov you want,0.04335068
it Helena get Thor upset that'll be a way to do it I'm just trying,0.018685674
to add a little bit more drama to your comedy where's kat dennings and now,0.037668686
by the nerd yeah God had that Stan Lee cameo it's a good one well,0.21725364
we also get another cameo from another Marvel hero that you might remember I don't,0.026357237
know that's a Doctor Strange song or the guild theme song it was fun to,0.030594457
see Doctor Strange and Loki kind of go head-to-head while in the battle Loki had,0.055357248
to go grab something for Thor and he's notices that tesseract is still under there,0.04206688
and they don't ever show him taking the tesseract but I think it's pretty safe,0.033285126
to assume he took it you know you can't trust Loki how in three movies,0.04261499
and the Avengers does Thor not realize stop trusting Loki I know he's your brother,0.03109002
but I got some family members and I love to but I don't keep my,0.037004165
wallet and plain sight around them cuz I know you get a funny after credit,0.06090089
scene with Jeff Goldblum at the very very end and you get a very interesting,0.05911753
scene in the mid credits where Thor and Loki they've got a bunch of people,0.0383352
in the ship everything is cool and then this much much bigger ship just shows,0.026184954
up and they don't show who's in that ship but I'm gonna have a good,0.04354159
guess that probably involves a big purple being with a really cool blinged out gauntlet,0.022916242
I think the infinity war is about to begin I do like the movie I,0.089996025
really think it's fun in this movie being a little over hyped right now maybe,0.046363965
if you want to sense the best door yet I'm all about that I could,0.03702811
believe that but best Marvel film I can't go that far but overall this is,0.03275697
just a fun freakin film so those are my thoughts on Thor Ragnarok what did,0.29586563
you think if you saw the movie or do you plan on seeing the movie,0.032950535
