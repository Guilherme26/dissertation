so at Disney press screenings they take your phone they don't trust us every other studio,0.10284341
lets you keep your phone I mean they have security in the room watching you you know those little devices to see if anyone's recording but Disney makes you hand over every electronic device and they wand you going in to make sure you hand it in and you have to put it in a little plastic baggie and you get a little you know baggage claim ticket and you have to pick it up after the screening and let me tell you the line is long,0.102036834
but because they do that and you have to get there early to make sure you get a good seat there are no reserved seats at these press screenings,0.08088574
so I decided this time to bring some reading material and I brought the Time magazine that recently came out with chadwick boseman on the front of it talking about this very movie,0.05213859
and you know what it ended up being the perfect choice,0.067027345
because black panther plays more like Time magazine than a comic book,0.23991492
I was very surprised now it works and a lot but it's different,0.03055722
so allow me to explain first off,0.08202516
it is extremely political,0.07630945
but I appreciated the political comments it had to make,0.055873703
I think that in the run-up to this film's release they've been made to see much more incendiary than they are,0.09642647
and they're not you know you know they've they've been made to see more Malcolm X and I think they're very much,0.12408095
Martin Luther King jr. side note if you haven't seen Selma you should see it Ava Duvernay was so good directing that movie she's almost got this one,0.18608221
and she and Ryan Coogler are super close,0.18639381
he talked about editing across the hall from her a wrinkle in time,0.064028084
you know her editing as well and I hope you know we'll see if that movie turns out just as political,0.15534864
but anyway there's also a National Geographic element to this film and it's exploration of Wakanda its history,0.07727966
and its traditions,0.049799077
and you know I have to say it's it's odd to me and you know I'm not gonna go into spoiler territory,0.15139931
so don't worry about it,0.101451784
but I have to say that it was odd that a civilization was such filled ristic technology like it it almost seemed made-up haha it was made up of course,0.07924233
but you know it was amazing,0.06436306
but I don't understand how they would be so primitive in their leadership structure and board that come to bite them in the butt we'll discuss in the spoiler review I also have to add that for all the wonderful dynamic female characters that are featured in the movie and they've made a big deal about that at the end of the day,0.6364068
they're all still support staff which also comes from tribal culture,0.05497464
and I don't think that's a great idea either,0.07149049
so but anyway we'll discuss all that in a spoiler review but well it's politics,0.08651672
in its world-building are impressive and admirable,0.06824549
you know what I actually have to say it reminded me of a fascinating follow-up to roots and that's hard for me to say because obviously as I've discussed before I'm not a member of the black community,0.4940739
I'm an outsider looking in but that's what I felt,0.09908733
when I was watching the movie as the next touchstone in the journey of defining the black community,0.35111862
its sense of self,0.23713192
and also I think you know for anyone like myself watching this material how its seen,0.10673949
and the fact that a comic book movie can achieve that is incredibly noteworthy very very impressive and again while that is all impressive though the movie doesn't have nearly enough action,0.06394193
I was surprised how little action it has I can't believe that no one brought that up to Ryan Coogler and said you know this is all really fascinating,0.10128836
you're really making me think and I think you're doing a lot for the world with this movie but it's also comic-book movie and we promise people a lot of action in the trailers,0.15168221
so maybe you should consider delivering it it has two extended action sequences and they both go by way too quickly,0.107212864
made all,0.030694095
the more frustrating by the fact that when they click they really click there were a couple of moments in this movie where my it took my breath away and most of them we're doing the action sequences,0.09167346
but some of the wort and again that's mighty impressive now as a comic book movie I would put Black Panther on the same level as the first x-men movie and also Batman Begins where a very talented filmmaker was still getting the hang of not just VFX work but working at this level,0.12353872
I would say to the movie I would say almost never felt like a big shiny blockbuster it it often felt like a small movie like the films that Ryan Coogler has been making,0.09087526
and I would say that the Russo brothers are still the best in the biz this when it comes to not only doing action sequences but realizing their importance you know it's like,0.08340449
what that story that Steven Soderbergh story that they they really should teach it in film school and they should may put it on every film set where he said I was at an airport and I saw someone in our target demographic just fast-forwarding through a big blockbuster movie just to watch the action sequences and some people that's the way they consume the material,0.08441163
I think we're all consumer the material that way,0.076167785
sometimes there's nothing wrong,0.057792645
with that Steven Soderbergh thought there was but the Russo brothers understand that's how a lot of this stuff is consumed and they build their movies accordingly,0.17775294
Ryan Coogler has yet to learn that lesson and because of the lack of action,0.1608438
I worry about this movie's repeat watch ability factor especially to those it doesn't resonate with culturally another problem in terms of rewatch ability is that the film exists in a bubble it has nothing to do with the MCU at large that doesn't mean it's not entertaining,0.046692125
but I just don't want you to go and disappointed alright,0.18683009
so next the music with all due respect to Kendrick Lamar's album Ludwig Gordon his score does a lot to make this movie but frustratingly like the action the music comes and goes too quickly,0.07815029
I'd be like oh this is so good why did you stop playing it,0.16146518
I want more of it I'm definitely buying the score as it was both tribal and modern at the same time like Wakanda itself oh well Conda much like Pandora many people who see this movie say they would like to go there,0.08206518
and don't worry just like with Pandora,0.061921056
Disney will be happy to oblige very soon at one of their theme parks and they should I would definitely want to go there,0.052481126
and on that note Wakanda felt like two things,0.08867542
and the other one though was like a real place,0.058344934
but what was a theme park which again I would very much like to visit while I was watching the movie it I almost was like where can I have my my brick my character breakfast and where's the Black Panther ride,0.20059584
and what time is the stage show start it was really cool,0.04472285
but the other thing that it felt like and this is far more important obviously is it felt like an idea,0.068960294
now at one point in the film it's referred to as a fantasy which was quite touching but even better it was also established in the film as aspirational,0.07282182
and that is Black Panthers biggest gift to the world hopefully redefining how the black community sees itself all not redefining of I think that's a much better word evolving how the black community sees itself because it's very much has one foot in the past,0.46599793
and also how others see the black community,0.38877645
and I think that's really noteworthy and remarkable and I'd have given Ryan Coogler another hour to explore this make it a three hour movie I wonder if I would gladly watch it another hour of this,0.07534468
but he'd have to promise me the 20 of those 60 minutes would be more action,0.11849573
now that acting is top notch across the board and all the characters are incredibly charismatic likeable and complex,0.0833632
I also was blown away by the strength of the relationships portrayed and a lot of that is accomplished by the actors,0.09106014
and I was particularly impressed with the brother-sister bond between T'Challa and Sheree very unusual to see inmates true entertainment for any group,0.055540007
I just thought that was really nice as someone who has a very close relationship with my own sister,0.27034384
so I really like that a lot now without spoilers my favorites are chadwick boseman of course it's his movie but in a very understated way with tisha Wright in a very understated way,0.13695207
I love her mind and I love her fashions,0.09493137
I would love to raid her closet,0.8149734
she looked fantastic,0.12413802
she I think she doesn't have any thumb holes,0.42836326
but it's in the thumb hole category we would get along Danai gurira Wow totally see why she got upgraded to infinity war,0.2303171
she was one of the moments that took my breath away in the casino,0.15172006
you know what what you see it,0.068081036
because you'll probably have your breath taken away,0.40315142
Winston Duke what a scene stealer and then Andy Serkis having so much fun,0.53490317
it's criminal,0.18924354
now as for Martin,0.049542062
Freeman also a warning,0.14591861
he has a very small role,0.112728246
it's almost non-existent,0.07099747
but I thought there was some poetic justice in it after having after having to see poor Jeffrey Wright basically run through Bond movies the last couple of Bond films,0.17710897
now I would not see this movie in 3d the press screening was in 2d and it looked great,0.08560858
and if the studio doesn't show it in 3d that means they know it shouldnít does not need to be seen that way,0.06685206
for instance guardians of the galaxy vol 2 was shown to the press in 3d and it was remarkable this 2d all the way there are also two end credits scenes,0.0553439
but they are very low-key,0.18051037
I mean they're nice and enjoyable,0.096726574
but they're not like,0.12595756
that's not one of the things take your breath away,0.2699878
Oh Inc inclusion just like everyone should see roots everyone should see Black Panther,0.1807588
I honestly feel it's that important,0.070950024
and as for its place in the MCU,0.051612783
and as a comic book movie just from an entertainment perspective the stage is now beautifully set and they should greenlight of sequel immediately I mean I guess,0.06162567
they're waiting to see how it does opening weekend on the strength of this and the strength of the hype if I were Kevin Feige I already would have greenlit a sequel especially seeing that the film canal with its sequel hit the ground running and have more action gotta have more action,0.18641205
you know whenever I whenever I wrote a comic book called superbia and at the top of my outline I'd always put sex violence in action,0.6389411
and I'd be like does it have enough of these three things and you know they should they would move them to apply the same strategy to this fell to,0.07406908
the sequel in all movies quite frankly,0.17819872
but anyway that's my review black panther,0.24922398
I look forward to hearing your thoughts down below but no spoilers save those for the spoiler review I really appreciate action,0.10884196
you know in all honesty talking about this movie with you,0.14957394
it's a very important and tricky film to discuss as we've been discussing this week,0.0773357
and so I'm really honestly,0.058467645
you know I always look forward to discussing movies with you down below,0.46925113
but with this one I am honored to partake in the discussion of something,0.05402867
I know is so important to a group that I'm not a part of alright,0.09147087
so anyway,0.06061376
I loved it write your thoughts down below and you can check out some more videos as always right,0.26940086
