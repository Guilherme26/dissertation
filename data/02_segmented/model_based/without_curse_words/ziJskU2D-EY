"Hello, everybody, and welcome back to my channel"
"If you're new here, Hi, I'm Mia, Tiffany, and today we are going to be watching the highly recommended highly anticipated film Casablanca, And y'all I am so excited to watch this film"
"Okay, So Casablanca was released in 1942, directed by Michael Curtis, starring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, and Paul Henried as Victor Laszlo, with other notable performances by Claude Raines, who we saw actually in Mr"
"Smith goes to Washington, Sydney Greenstreet, who we saw in Christmas in Connecticut, and S"
"Z Caskel, who we've also seen in Christmas in Connecticut, So I'm excited to see all of them in this film"
"So before we get into a little bit more of the film background, I kind of wanted to add in some historical background because there was a lot going on around this film"
"So if you want to stay and listen to the historical background, please do so, or if you want to skip right on to the film reaction, you can do that too, but without further ado, let us get into some historical background"
"Okay, so during the time of the film's release, the world was at war, and because of that Hollywood kind of shifted into more moral boosting and patriotic themes, and as we know, Casablanca is no stranger to these themes"
"In fact, it was originally supposed to come out in 1943"
"However, they pushed it to 1942, in order to align it with the Allied forces successful invasion of North Africa"
"Now this invasion uh, served as the first step in sort of weakening the Axis powers hold on Southern Europe, and then, in the very next year, in January of 1943, the city of Casablanca served as the location for the Casablanca Conference, which was attended by Fdr and Winston Churchill, So not only did all of these events increase the popularity of the film also show the Us's"
support for the Allied forces
I also wanted to take a moment to shout out grouchy marks for adding some of this information in the comments
Thank you so much
"Also, I really appreciated and loved your story about how your grandparents went to go see this film and all of the excitement in the movies"
"So thank you again, grouchy marks for sharing that with all of us"
"Okay, So a quick synopsis of this film it says, a cynical, expatriate American cafe owner struggles to decide whether or not to help his former lover and her fugitive husband escape the Nazis in French Morocco"
Some interesting things that I found about this film
"So first of all, this film was actually based off of an unproduced play called Everybody comes to Ricks, written by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison"
"Now they actually ended up selling the rights to Warner Bros for 20 000, which at the time was actually a record-breaking sum"
Everybody who worked on this film did not anticipate the success that it would have
"It actually became the fourth highest grossing film in 1943, taking home a whopping 10 million, 462 500 in the domestic box office"
"It also was nominated for eight Oscars three of which it won for writing directing, and then the Big Ticket One, which is Outstanding motion picture"
"Yeah, so this film is very popular and had a lot of success, And I'm so so so excited and so glad to be sharing this moment of my first time watching this with all of you"
I cannot wait to watch this film
"but before we do, y'all already know the deal"
"If you haven't already, please subscribe to my channel and hit that bell"
notification to stay in the loop
"Alright, everyone, it is time the moment we've all been waiting for"
Please get your drinks and your snacks and let us get in to Casablanca
"Also, by the way, I have all fruits"
"I have bananas and oranges, because I am trying to be healthy, but I wish I had ice cream to all officers"
"two German couriers carrying important official documents, murdered and trained from Iran, murderer and possible accomplices headed for Casablanca"
"Okay, I just want to explain really quick"
"So in the beginning they were saying that Um to, in order to escape the Nazis reign in Europe, a lot of refugees traveled from Paris down to Casablanca, and they're waiting to be able to go to Lisbon and then to the New world, which I'm assuming is America, So I just wanted to explain that, because I feel like that might have gotten a little lost"
It might get lost in the editing too
So everyone is trying to leave Casablanca to go to Lisbon to go to America
Perhaps tomorrow will be on the plane
"I kind of, I feel for these people because they're essentially just sitting ducks, you know, waiting to be able to have enough money to go to to basically run to freedom like"
"I just think about the time that they lived in, and how much like stress and uproar and fear that was probably circulating around during the war"
It's just really
it's surreal like you don't think about it when you're comfortable in in 2021
"Just thinking about what happened in the past, but I just imagine what it must have been like for real people who were trying to escape to freedom"
like that must have been really hard
"There's Claude Rain, unoccupied"
France welcomes you to Casablanca
"Thank you, captain"
It's very good to be here
"Majestrous are my aide, Lieutenant Cassell, So the actor who plays Major Heinrich Strausser, he was actually born in Berlin, and he was publicly known to be anti-nazi But the only way that he was going to play this role of Heinrich Strausser is if the as if the character was, quote a villain with no redeeming qualities like he wanted to make sure that this character didn't have any sort of goodness in him"
"I guess, which I thought was really interesting"
Like that was his only
"Um, his only like, I'll only play the role if Xyz"
thank you
thank you and bring the 15 000 franks in cash
"Remember in cash, Gosh, Everyone is really trying to to get out"
"I think they also suspect that or they, they feel like it's only a matter of time, because at the time again the Nazis were were storming all these different countries, so I I wonder if they thought that it's only a matter of time before the Nazis come to Casablanca, So I think that's why everyone just wants to get out as quickly as possible"
"Oh Humphrey Bogart, I love Humphrey Bogart, and I say that honestly that he was actually the first male um love interest that I saw in the classic film"
The first classic film that I ever watched was Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart
And that began my love affair with classic films
I absolutely love Humphrey Bogart Letters of transit
So are those are those the transit papers that the two Germans had did? He must have gotten a hold of them
"Oh my goodness, So that makes him like a poi? What else I'm noticing about this film Is there's a lot more motion in the camera"
"I can see that there's a lot more movement in the camera, and the cinematography is is moving and and moving through Rick's cafe, And I also wonder if that's because of Citizen King, Because I do remember reading that a lot of cinematography after that film was really inspired by that film again"
"I, I read it somewhere"
I
"I don't know if I'm 100 True, so if I'm wrong, please correct me, but yeah, I'm just noticing there's a lot more movement with the camera and a lot more pannings, and and moving around as if you know, we're kind of walking around with the characters and I really loved seeing that because usually the camera is very stationary, so it kind of has more of a modern feel to it which I really appreciate Who's got nothing? We got"
nothing
"How much? I don't know why, Like, I don't know why I get so excited to see actors that I've seen in previous films that we've watched on this channel"
Because it's like duh actors
They're in multiple projects
"It's like seeing Tom Cruise and you know, just another film, but for some reason for me, it's like Oh my gosh, like I know, I know Sydney Greenstreet, or I know Claude Rains, like I've seen his work before and it's just so exciting to be able to say that I know their work, but then also to see them, you know, in different characters in these old films"
"I, I don't know"
I just get super excited if you guys have
Do you guys get excited like that? I don't know
Let me know in the comment box
"If you do now, I'm officially putting that song in my Spotify playlist"
That was a lot of fun
"Yeah, but I was stuck because he won"
I love you
"Oh, shut up"
So the actress that plays Yvonne actually outlived all of the other cast members
I don't believe she died until 2016
she died in 2016
"Yeah, that is what a life"
"But how cool would it have been to to tell people? Oh yeah, I was actually a cast member in Casablanca Like that would be so cool"
I don't know who were you last night
That's so long ago
I don't remember
Will I see you tonight? I never make plans that far ahead
I really love how Humphrey Bogart is playing into his cynicism
"It, You really feel it from his character, and for some reason I just feel like it it"
I don't know
"It just makes his character more, which he's supposed to be cynical"
"But the way that he's playing it, it's like it's so believable like he's He's a really good actor, Really good actor"
You would like to be on it Every single time There's a plane that goes through or a plane that takes off
It's very consistent
The way that everybody reacts to it
You can tell that they're all just
"They're just wishing that they were on that plane, but more so, it's almost as if it's like a symbol of freedom, which makes more sense because flying when you think of flying anything freedom"
but I just love the consistency of of how everyone reacts to a plane taking off
It's just goes to show how much care was taken into this screenplay
"Absolutely, there is a man arrived in Casablanca on his way to America"
He will offer a fortune to anyone who'll furnish him with an exit visa
"What's his name? Victor Laszlo? No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa or I should say too"
"why, too"
He's traveling with a lady
How convenient that there were two German couriers who were murdered for their exit visas
And now there are two people who need said exit visas to escape the Nazis
I mean it most likely was done intentionally
"Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans and their beloved Paris, Not particularly my beloved Paris"
"Can you imagine us in London when you get there? Ask me, so, watching this, I feel like I don't know"
I didn't
I didn't read this anymore
but this is just a hunch
"Have you guys ever seen Quentin Tarantino's and Glorious Bastards? Well, this scene reminds me of the scene when they're like in the pub or like in the the bar, And there's like tensions are heightened because Michael Fassbender's character is like a"
"You know, he's like a double agent"
They're all sitting around the table
"It really reminds me of this scene, so I don't know if this scene was influenced or that scene was influenced by this scene, or if it was just kind of a coincidence, which I don't feel like there are coincidences in in Hollywood, but I don't know it"
Just it really reminds me of that scene
"Oh, and if you guys know if Quentin Tarantino really did get inspiration from this scene, please let me know in the comment box"
I would love to know that piece of information
"How about New York? Well, there are certain sections of New York Major that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade"
"Uh-huh who do you think will win the war with the slightest idea? I really appreciated that when he asked him, who do you think will win the war And he's like, I haven't the slightest idea that he didn't push"
"Well it, First of all, it's not even in his character to push which side would win, but I appreciate that they didn't make that into"
"Uh, oh, we think Americans are gonna win, or we think the Germans are gonna win like they made it very neutral, which obviously fit for Bogart's character, but I think that that that just had a little bit more of a innuendo in there, Like at the time they didn't know who was going to win the war and there was a lot of fear that was like circled around who's going to win and what's gonna happen afterward, But I appreciate that they left that ambiguous because I feel like if they were to push it, you know, into the more patriotic side and say the Americans, are you know like the allied forces are gonna win"
Then I feel like it would have been a little bit too
"um, like it wouldn't have"
It wouldn't have been realistic
"Just obviously, for the time that it came out, I'm just really happy that they left that ambiguous so that it's not you know, giving people false hope if the allied forces didn't win"
"Oh so that's Victor Laszlo, thank you, but I hardly think"
then
"perhaps for the lady, the Ring is quite unique"
"Oh yes, I'm very interested"
"I love the spy elements of this movie too, like there is a lot of like"
It almost feels like I don't know if that's right
Like espionage
I don't know if that's the right word
but there's a lot of like spy elements in this film that the two German couriers for the transit papers got in play as time goes by
"Sing it, Sam"
you must remember this
A kiss is just a key
"Wow, what a beautiful"
the music in this movie Kudos to Max Steiner
"I, I don't believe he's alive anymore, but kudos to him for for using this music and he's like"
Why are you playing this song Bro? Did you see that longing stare? I want to know the history there of all the gin joints and all the towns in all the world
She walks into mine
"So under all that cynicism, and under all that that he puts up there really truly is a sentimental man"
"I mean, you can see it, and the way he's acting like the way that he is almost longing for her Like dang I love flashbacks"
So they had a love of a love affair and penalty
"We said No questions is looking at you, kid? Oh, it's like the line"
"Well, one of the lines, but still why? there is no other man in my life"
That's easy
That was
he's dead
I'm sorry for asking
Nothing kills a beautiful love story like war
"Wednesday, Thursday, at the latest, they'll be in Paris"
They'll find out your record
It won't be safe for you here
"I'm on a blacklist already, I will say"
it is interesting to hear other accents like we on this channel
"We've heard the British accent in the 1930s, but Ingrid Bergman is from Sweden, and so to hear her accent on top of the like, the 1930s way that they used to talk is very interesting because it sounds very different than what a Swedish accent sounds like"
"Now this sort of takes a sting out of being occupied, does it, Mr"
Richard? You said it
"He's looking at you, kid"
I didn't know
He said it multiple times in the movie
I thought it was just honestly
"I thought it was just that one time at the end like that one scene that they always show where they're like in the rain, but I guess he says it multiple times"
"I love that though, or is it my heart pounding? So this may ruin some parts of this movie for you, and I apologize in advance"
"So Ingrid Bergman was two or three inches taller than Humphrey Bogart, which means that whenever they, whenever they did scenes together, they had Humphrey either stand on the platform or they tied like boxes like platforms to his shoes to make him seem taller than Ingrid, and then Ingrid would would be acting barefoot, and so that, I just think it's funny because during the romantic scenes you want to be like"
"Oh, it's so romantic and then you think to yourself, but he's standing on a platform at that point"
"No, no, no, no, we must leave"
"Yes, of course, we, the train for my Saili's at five o'clock I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4 30"
"Christmas, if it were the last time, so another random piece of movie fact"
"So this scene? Well, this flashback scene was one of the first scenes that they shot in the production schedule, and Humphrey Bogart was like He's like"
I don't want to shoot these scenes because I'm not like all about that romance life or something like that
"He said something like that and Michael Curtis was like, You know what, we just got to get it"
We got to get it
"Grab it, and we'll move on to the other stuff"
So I just thought that was interesting
A little interesting
"fun fact to note, Yeah, but now everyone is fleeing from Paris"
"Gosh, the just I could just imagine like the chaos and the pandemonium"
"But then also there's that aspect of like, there's a sadness"
like you're leaving
Some people had to leave
"You know, their homes and the place where they grew up for a land that they, a foreign land to them"
"So it's just like I said, I think in the last in the last video, these films really give you insight into kind of how life was lived during the time"
And there's just there's a
There's a sadness that I feel for these people that were uprooted out of their lives because of this war like it's It's just it's really sad
it says Richard
I cannot go with you or ever see you again
You must not ask
"why, Just believe that I love you go, my darling, and God bless you, Ilsa"
Oh so she left him
She was acting real shady in the last scene and that's what broke his heart
"I wonder if that's where his cynicism comes from, because he doesn't seem very cynical"
"In this flashback, he seems like a sentimentalist, so this must have made him cynical"
and there she is
"Oh no, this spells trouble"
"Oh God, I feel bad for both of them"
It kind of has elements of brief encounter where they weren't trying to fall in love
They were just two people who happened to meet in Paris who fell in love
"And yeah, and that sucks"
Sometimes life just sucks
Can I tell you a story? It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo
She met a man about whom she had heard her whole life
"Everything she knew or whatever became was because of him, but the feeling she supposed was love"
She's not talking about Rick
I think she's talking about Victor when she was talking about meeting a man after coming from Oslo
"Oh, tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo or were there others in between? Aren't you the kind to tell? Wow, He's just talking out of anger and and pain"
"Don't let it get to you, or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow"
On one condition you know the leader of the underground movement in Paris in Prague
you'll furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts
You will have your visa in the morning
"Laszlo is literally telling this, this, Um"
"Heinrich that, like, yeah, I'm I'm the leader of the like"
he
They all know that he's a leader of the resistance
And but there's no like guns being drawn
There's no
"you know, no violent things happening, And it's just interesting to see the production code and and the role that it plays in this in the storytelling"
"because I feel like if this was a film that were to come out in 2021, or you know, in the 2000s, there would be a lot more violence"
There'd be a lot more like struggle
"Because like I said, I was watching and I'm like, Why isn't Why isn't Heinrich like doing anything like physically like, Why isn't he like you know, like shooting guns, or like you know, holding him down or restraining him, or or on the flip side, Like why? Why does everyone know the Um Laszlo secret? Like? wouldn't that be more secretive? But no, and I I suspect it's because of the production code, so it's just interesting to see its influence"
"Did you run out on me Because you couldn't take it Because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police, running away all the time"
"No, you say Victor Lasler is my husband and was even when I knew you in Paris"
"Oh, oh my God, So she was married when they were in love in Paris"
"What also? doesn't that violate the haze code? Because? Oh, I guess it doesn't Because she, because she thought that her husband was dead"
"Have you heard about Senior Gotti in the letters of transit? Yes, something"
those letters were not found in a guardian when they arrested him
You know where they are
not for sure
I'll venture to guess that a God
he left those letters with Messier
"Oh, so now they know that Rick has the papers"
"Oh, that's lovely, God"
I love the boldness of Lazlo
He's so bold and I absolutely love him
I love his character
"I really love him and everyone stands out to sing the French, the French national anthem"
I have goosebumps
That's awesome
More than anything
Now
I need Rick to give him the transit papers
"Yes, but no intention of selling them When I was in a concentration camp where you lonely in Paris"
He knows he has to know
Why would he ask that And she's there
"How did she get in there? All right? Oh, she has a gun pointed at him"
"No, I want those letters"
Go ahead and shoot
He'll be doing me a favor
She's not gonna shoot you
She loves you
Their their romance and their chemistry is very
You
"Can you can tell that there's a lot of chemistry between their characters, but I also read that behind the scenes they weren't as romantic with each other, But it's just it's interesting because their chemistry is so good"
I knew it
"It's romantic, so that scene was only allowed because of an editing difference because of the dissolve that we just saw"
"They used a dissolve instead of a fade out, because at the time a fade out suggested that two people were taking things a step further, If you know what I mean, if you're catching my wind, So instead of a fade out, they decided to do a dissolve into the next scene"
"And so that's why this scene or this storyline was like, or this scene alone was allowed"
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret? It wasn't my secret
Richard
Victor wanted it that way
What about now? now? I don't know
I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again
"So she's planning on staying with him in Casablanca, and that makes sense, because when she was trying to explain it to him that night when he was drunk, she was saying that she mistook her uh, fascination with with Laszlo's work as love"
She just really loved what he was about
And so she thought that that was love
And so that's why she married him
"Then she finds out that she's actually in love with Rick, and everything kind of comes crashing down when they're trying to escape"
And then she realizes that Laszlo is still alive like that Is that is good storytelling
"Wow, I know a good deal more about you than you suspect"
I know
For instance that you're in love with a woman
It's perhaps a strange circumstance
we both should be in love with the same woman
"The first evening I came into this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Elsa"
I told you he knew
I told you he knew
"Yep, not so fast, Louie"
nobody's gonna be arrested
Not for a while yet
Keep your hands on the table
"I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means"
I do
We've got plenty of time to discuss that later
"Is this whole thing like a ruse? No, I don't think this is a ruse"
I'm saying this only to make me go
I'm saying it because it's true
inside of us
we both know you belong with Victor
"Did you see that motion camera? I mean, like the camera zoom in that"
I don't know why
"I feel like I haven't seen that in these films and I really really love that they used it in this video in this movie In this film, What about us? We'll always have Paris"
We didn't have we
We lost it until you came to Casablanca
That's another really popular line
I'm sorry
let me watch you
"Let's watch it again, because I did talk over it"
Let's try one more time
What about us? We'll always have Paris
We didn't have we
We lost it until you came to Casablanca
"Is looking at you, kid"
That's the one that I remember
"Oh no, and the bad man is coming"
Welcome back to the fight
This time I know our side will win
"Oh, did you hear what he said? he said This time I know our side will win"
Dang that is wow
that's awesome
This film is awesome
"I love you guys, but get on the plane, please"
The Nazis are coming
"Oh my gosh, I'm like sweating"
I'm like please
"Oh my God, there he is"
but they're on the plane
It's too late
"Oh my God, he shot him"
"Oh my goodness, round up the usual suspects"
round up the usual suspects
That's another one
This is so cool
"Like to be able to watch it well, Rick"
"you're not only a sentimentalist, but you become a patriot"
I really seem like a good time to start
I think perhaps you're right
"Okay, There was some"
There was some sort of significance with that Vici water
I don't know what it is
"but if any of you know, let me know cause there was some sort of significance there"
"There it is again that that realization that that they're not leaving again, the consistency of of like every, like literally, everyone's faces whenever they see the plane leaving, it's always the same face"
"Like I'm not on that plane, or Oh, that symbolizes our freedom"
"or that is, that is consistency, and I like that it might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while"
There's a free French garrison over a brother view
I could be induced to a range of passage
My letter of transit
"I could use a trip like, I can't believe that like this is such an iconic scene, and I can't believe that that's Claude reigns"
Like I didn't even realize that that's freaking Claude reigns
I don't know why I'm freaking out
It's just like I know him and I know his work and I I'm freaking out
I'm sorry
this is so cool
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
"Oh Lily, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"
"Oh, what a great film"
Oh my goodness
"Oh my God, that was such a good film"
y'all That was so worth it
"Like so worth the wait, So worth watching"
I really enjoyed it because it was adventure and it was romance and it was intrigue
And then all of the actors that I that I know from previous films like this movie was definitely a 10
Like this was just a really good film
I'm like
"I'm really excited that I got to watch it, especially with all of you"
Like this has been so awesome
I'm so glad that we've gotten to this point
I really loved it
Thank you guys so much for recommending it
I'm so happy I can finally say that I watched Casablanca
