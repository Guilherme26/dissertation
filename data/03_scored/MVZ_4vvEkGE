hey everyone welcome back to my channel I'm Stef Koza and I have not posted,0.08073806
a video in a while so hello hi still alive it's summer it's time for,0.15493865
vacations and traveling and not sitting in this room all the time but summertime also,0.08284253
means an incredible amount of summer blockbusters so here we are about to review one,0.06264654
Mission Impossible fallout let's go so this is one of those movies where you see,0.08418266
the trailer and you're like do we need another Mission Impossible movie not really but,0.10444284
after seeing it I feel like I needed it I had so much fun watching,0.058246996
Mission Impossible fall out what I feel like the first thing that needs to be,0.06960029
addressed here is Tom Cruise 56 years old six the Mission Impossible film really action-packed,0.07562658
like heavy load of like stunts and practical effects and like difficult for a 56,0.12391779
year old man to be doing so a lot of people were like can he,0.24068955
still do this like is this is this gonna be okay or is this gonna,0.15486175
be like some weird crickety old frail man trying to like embrace his younger self,0.31089434
that he just can't find anymore but if you told me that this man was,0.13181622
56 years old I would not believe you just what he is just as incredible,0.15479258
if not more incredible then he's always been in all the Mission Impossible films I,0.12686211
don't really like Tom Cruise like nobody really likes Tom Cruise like let's be real,0.20491266
he's kind of a prick sorry Tom but I am so impressed by him like,0.6492628
he does 99% of his own stunts he wants them all to be practical he,0.21337846
doesn't like green screen so he will literally be hanging off the helicopter doing some,0.24182148
ridiculous stunts just because he wants to because he cares about the movie and he's,0.69542736
like this is what it has to be like I just I have to do,0.06277215
this sorry and it's so cool and it really shows in the movies you can,0.090395555
tell like this was a real stunt this this happened in real life and I,0.105375804
really do appreciate the hell out of that because not a lot of people do,0.35078368
that especially in this day and age he's badass enough at 56 years old to,0.4032787
be hanging off helicopters and climbing rocks and skydiving I can't even do that now,0.60499007
25 so mission impossible fallout is directed by the same drew after that did the,0.062726155
previous Mission Impossible movie this is like a direct sequel to the events that happened,0.08705838
there it's like the same characters the same villain so they're very closely related and,0.09595962
this movie is also very much like pretty much what you would expect we know,0.11514177
the format the formula of a Mission Impossible movie at this point there's some exposition,0.055886183
it's like okay now we get it and then once you get it it's just,0.10431212
a whirlwind of action sequences and just ridiculous like there's hardly any lines in like,0.64453536
the second and third acts it's just ridiculous amounts of incredible action but that's what,0.4804052
we signed up for when we go see Mission Impossible well you know that's what,0.062319275
we're getting into I would describe this movie like a roller coaster kind of ebbs,0.16142379
and flows there are lots of like really high intensity moments and then really low,0.050141554
kind of boring exposition moments but like the overarching plot of the movie like the,0.1529161
whole experience it's kind of like when you're going up a rollercoaster hill and it's,0.11464571
like the really big hill and you're just like slowly like working your way up,0.16615559
and it's just like and you have like this anticipation building but it's really slow,0.16166149
and you're just kind of looking around and you're like oh I can see my,0.15043019
car from here and then you finally get to the top and she's like and,0.08361919
that's the rest of the first act up the hill rest of the movie crazy,0.45019177
rollercoaster and it's really fun like I did not expect to have that much fun,0.09292547
in this movie I had so much fun like I'd have to point out this,0.100257546
is a three hour movie this movie was three hours long there was not one,0.08427406
moment where I realized it was three hours long like I walked out of the,0.05811722
theater and I said holy it's 11 o'clock how did this happen but it was,0.092158385
like really it was just so fun and so exciting and so many new things,0.076976955
kept happening as I cool ooh ooh what and it was just very exciting I,0.04603852
will say the villains villain villains were not super interesting I think some of that,0.15020554
has to do with the fact that the villain why does my microphone always die,0.36706716
every time every time hey whilst I never make a video without her microphone dying,0.46955195
halfway through we'll never know anyways what was I talking about what was I saying,0.09638239
villains I think the villain in this movie is Lane who was established in the,0.1376824
previous movie so there wasn't really any like we don't need to know much more,0.08243051
about him we kind of already know but that made it a little bit boring,0.34990022
because like he doesn't really say much of anything throughout the entire movie he's just,0.13359292
sort of there he's just kind of a problem and it's just more about them,0.16263837
solving this mission and solving this problem that he has created but he's not really,0.07671836
doing anything after he's created the problem if that makes sense so the the real,0.089447595
villain of this movie is just like the mission that they're trying to solve and,0.11728628
then there are obviously like some people who get in the way and like try,0.11864804
and stop them from solving this mission because you have to have a million car,0.11727952
chases and fight scenes and all that good stuff but I don't think any of,0.10245804
it is like strongly motivated by anything and that was one flaw that the movie,0.09004509
had was just kind of like face value it's a mission they need to solve,0.087109186
it save the people run from the bad guys very top-level average action movie stuff,0.2385458
but like I said this movie does have some incredible plot twists that I never,0.08294276
would have thought of there were so many things that happened that I did not,0.049517963
see coming at all and every time they happened I was just like oh like,0.08705277
everyone in the theater just starts screaming they're just like what's happening like really well-written,0.18012035
ideas and concepts and there's a lot of like sticky situations that they get into,0.15667087
and you're like I literally could not even think of a way to get out,0.31441563
of this like the writing is surprisingly impressive I think the dialogue is not very,0.10149351
good there are a lot of like kind of cheesy moments but I think that's,0.10801602
sort of part of the charm of Mission Impossible is it's like it's a shitty,0.8606264
action movie that's actually not that shitty it's like one of those blockbusters that's like,0.8606264
a pretty good blockbuster like I would definitely watch it again it was really fun,0.0845829
Ethan Hunt is still a really believable character even with Tom Cruise being 56 years,0.057274476
old like he really convinces you that he can do all of these things you,0.13341026
just kind of love him like I started the movie and I was a guy,0.12595761
I forgot how much I hate Tom Cruise but then I got like halfway through,0.41218266
the movie knows like I love you you're so great you're such a good character,0.086086184
it's just so cool and I mean there are a lot of moments in this,0.0779981
movie where you're like that would never happen that's just ridiculous like it's a little,0.67031014
bit believable like everything kind of like you could defend it with physics it's just,0.24160324
kind of like in an anomaly situation but like it could happen it's just very,0.10198743
unlikely that all of these things happen to this guy and like he was okay,0.31089434
but that's kind of the excitement of it's kind of funny like whenever something like,0.079863355
that happened like everyone in my theater would just laugh like you know it's not,0.13470858
a moment in the movie where you're supposed to laugh but it's just so ridiculous,0.7093121
that you can't help it and it was just made it kind of more fun,0.1197474
some people might consider that a flaw I consider it a charm I think Henry,0.13278261
cavils character was a little bit he had some good moments but in general not,0.084894076
super interesting probably could have done without him I mean he was crucial to a,0.084557846
few plot points so I get it I don't know I wasn't really blown away,0.11249024
by his presence I think Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames really stole the show I,0.31561732
love the two of them together Rebecca Ferguson was also a super badass I just,0.27957794
love to see a girl kicking ass just as hard as the rest of the,0.9280189
cast like yours are so invigorating to watch her work but yeah in general I,0.46898004
thoroughly enjoyed this movie way more than I thought I would it's a three hour,0.106625214
movie that doesn't feel like three hours and I would say mission impossible fallout is,0.044602998
the best action movie this year so far but that's just because we don't have,0.055268444
John wick yet zing I'm so excited okay yes mission impossible fallout I'm gonna give,0.12463243
it a four a four out of five surprisingly good really just came out of,0.08256819
left field I wasn't even excited to see it I was like I have to,0.08831135
go see Mission Impossible but I loved it I had so much fun if you're,0.11062738
