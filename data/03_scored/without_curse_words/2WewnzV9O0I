hey there guys John can't be here thanks for checking out my movie vlog I'm,0.11212364
in San Diego in my hotel at the moment in case you can't tell and,0.14542447
this is my quick review for the brand new Christopher Nolan film Dunkirk now Dunkirk,0.09643086
is based on the true events when four hundred thousand soldiers with their back to,0.080843635
the sea trapped on a beach completely surrounded by German forces that were coming in,0.2031386
and no way to get home and the concerted organized effort to save those guys,0.050321188
now a few months ago there was a lot of conundrum going on because people,0.074930385
found out that this was going to be a pg-13 movie and how on earth,0.14008236
can you do a true war movie that's worth anything unless it's rated R I,0.15219657
mean if it's going to be good it's got lots of blood and guts right,0.49087822
or else it's just going to feel weak like Disney as if there's only one,0.14688635
specific formula you can use to make a war movie to make it any good,0.15418142
don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong formula formula is good but sometimes break in,0.10044281
the formula is also good that's the case with Dunkirk because believe me this is,0.051642235
one of the most intense films you are going to see this year maybe next,0.085161634
year maybe the year after that the way Christopher Nolan sculpts this story is so,0.05691482
impressive look we heard early on from some early screenings of the film that a,0.038687132
lot of critics are coming out saying you know what there's not a lot of,0.09815316
character development in this thing it's not allowed you know immersive dialogue we don't really,0.06188248
get to know the characters very well and that kind of set off some alarms,0.07816331
for some people but what you realize really quickly going into this film is that,0.080576144
this movie isn't about any of the characters this movie is about the situation and,0.05146059
more than that as a filmmaker and as an audience this movie was about Christopher,0.05951556
Nolan wanting to take the audience and immerse them into a real situation that happened,0.08716019
once and let you naturally feel all the intensity all the tension all the fear,0.13931893
that that situation would have had it was about taking you plucking you out of,0.2060205
that comfortable seat and dropping you into the middle of hell and when the bullets,0.6580036
are whizzing by and when the boats are sinking and when the planes are buzzing,0.11260296
overhead you didn't need to see blood to actually feel that terror you know what,0.27193838
this reminds me of and this is going to sound a little weird but follow,0.17558494
me here for a second it reminds me of that horror movie The Descent I,0.14895053
love that horror movie but what was so great about that movie it wasn't the,0.118330486
characters or getting to know them or the background whatever the reason I got so,0.039908826
sucked into that movie was the first half of the descent when their cave diving,0.66539705
and there you can feel the claustrophobic nature you're in there with them do what,0.1353383
they did in that movie was able to take you out of the comfort of,0.14045024
your seat and put you in that cave put you in that type spot make,0.35237837
you feel like you couldn't breathe feel how insanely scared you would be down there,0.4507974
because what they did was they didn't entrench you with the character at that point,0.06716666
they just embedded you into the situation so you could feel it that's what Dunkirk,0.07704802
does the movie is about taking you taking you out of that comfortable seat and,0.11228512
put you in the middle that war and making you feel it like honestly no,0.25432476
other war movie has ever made me feel it you know one of the truly,0.1431065
incredible things that Christopher Nolan does here you hear me say a lot for me,0.09900669
to care about action I first have to care about the characters if you get,0.05075891
me to care about the characters then the action has dramatic purpose and yet in,0.064025946
Dunkirk I never really got to care about any of the individual characters yes I,0.0745882
got to see Tom Hardy's great pilot yes I got to see Kenneth Branagh looking,0.08212434
very regal in a captain's hat and yes I got to see a bunch of,0.14215395
those things but I didn't care about the characters instead what Christopher Nolan did was,0.054180287
instead of getting you to care about the characters he got you to care about,0.07797777
the situation because like I mentioned before he makes you feel like you're in the,0.0748476
situation you're not suddenly but having the need to feel a connection to this one,0.10686496
particular guy in order to care about the action because you felt like you were,0.15602213
in it and that was all the motivation you need to care about the action,0.04061302
what's going on now I'm reading some people saying that Dunkirk is just all non-stop,0.1231579
from the beginning of the film to the end of images Moomba all non-stop all,0.116690546
non-stop and that's not necessarily true Christopher Nolan very intelligently throughout the film understands that,0.0918062
as an audience member we need to be able to catch our breath for a,0.07468212
minute now and again or else we just get fatigued with what's going on on,0.058775615
screen and there are very deliberate pauses throughout the film that give us that time,0.037333164
to catch our breath right before Nolan throws us right back into the fire again,0.17985411
the understanding of the preciousness of Hope the pure intensity of the movie having a,0.066796884
movie that's really able to teleport you from the comfort of your seat into the,0.10368972
situation itself are some of the reasons why Dunkirk is an absolute triumph now I've,0.062416974
been hearing some people saying that this is Christopher Nolan's greatest movie ever and I,0.10447274
can see why some people would say that I don't necessarily think so I don't,0.060193665
think it's the Dark Knight I don't think it's memento necessarily I don't think it's,0.05971583
as good as my favorite Christopher Nolan film insomnia but it ranks right up there,0.053379666
this is a truly fantastic film and it's a different kind of film it is,0.055632576
truly original how can a World War 2 movie be original and we've seen that,0.083799325
thousands of trust me it's the way that Nolan does the film that is very,0.06514494
unique and very original and I think is going to give you an experience in,0.060341842
the movie theater that you haven't had before but of course the most important thing,0.08698506
here is what do you think I know there are lots of advanced fanscreen these,0.06865304
