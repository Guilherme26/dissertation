starts that movie should have been the last x-men movie I don't know whose bright,0.23963703
idea what company's bright idea was to not have the x-men universe just end with,0.11587296
Logan logan is a movie about showcasing the life of a superhero in a world,0.12338344
in which superheroes lost it is a superhero story but not one that we've seen,0.09387829
explored all too often it's a movie that balances the complexities of a broken-down super,0.11212225
human having to live as a normal person Logan in this film is a shadow,0.18351549
of his former self a man who decided that yes I'd rather take a bullet,0.6088636
than let my car get damaged he drives the limousine by the way yes Wolverine,0.1810289
drives a limousine in this movie the x-men are dead it's at this point right,0.4031546
at the very beginning that the movie slams you in the face the people we've,0.24092409
been following all this time these heroes these icons are gone and one of their,0.09377409
own is to blame Charles Xavier easily the most paternal character the one that should,0.10258143
have been saving them humanity is what the x-men technically lost against not an evil,0.1075498
super villain or a mutant god Charles Xavier started to manifest Alzheimer's and lost control,0.20446284
of his powerful telepathic abilities Wolverine is dying due to metal poisoning from the adamantium,0.22977017
in his system the things that should make these characters larger than life is what,0.05926891
is causing them pain and with Xavier not even remembering what he did because of,0.1654165
what he has Logan has to carry Xavier is pain as well Logan is just,0.13254334
fully engine for this entire movie I mean let's be honest the x-men universe started,0.15330295
and should end with Wolverine right actually I'm lying the x-men universe started with rogue,0.3874229
and that isn't a joke I'm not smart enough to make a complex joke like,0.13747269
that I mean maybe that's why Cyclops storm and Jean were such cardboard cutouts in,0.07875998
the movie they focus too much on how to give rogue a white streak of,0.38040838
hair and forgot about literally the rest of the x-men either way even though rogue,0.33754313
pretty much started this whole thing it was her journey in the first film and,0.052494563
then Wolverine tagged along and he both mutually helped each other the main protagonist of,0.06537513
the film x-men is Wolverine and so I still stand by my belief that the,0.11654937
x-men universe should have ended with Logan right why is it that you releasing trailer,0.11282591
you're pushing your movie back to June while speaking with IGN Ken Berg talked a,0.092699945
bit about what fans could expect from gambit movie fresh Dark Phoenix we are ripping,0.26713148
that family apart the next few years there was no mention of gambit I suppose,0.066218875
that means the film is officially dead now New Mutants is going through reshoot so,0.31918344
it's been delayed for early 2019 I'm sorry I wait I mean no it's actually,0.12773731
it's actually delayed again and they still have to do the reshoots yeah great and,0.19073188
finally Dark Phoenix a movie that looks so mediocre that if you look up mediocre,0.6545184
in the dictionary you're gonna find a poster so this video is being edited to,0.15549621
then be released but then Dark Phoenix actually came out and the women are always,0.23985563
saving the men around here you might want to think about changing the name to,0.08699909
ex women it's not very good is it what I do like about it is,0.5154597
that it does feel like it tries even though it was rushed reshot multiple times,0.06624685
it does feel like people were trying to make a decent movie it didn't work,0.08313645
at all but they tried I thought the opening of the movie was solid I,0.058263075
thought Hans Zimmer's score was fantastic like most would expect unsurprisingly some of the best,0.08011421
parts of the movie are just Charles and Erik James McAvoy or McAvoy and Michael,0.04141997
Fassbender gives some great performances just like first class just like Days of Future past,0.1578954
they're actually trying also the main villain in Dark Phoenix IRA Cotter named Jessica Chastain's,0.12463216
character I mean she tries she's very forgettable what's funny is that I would rather,0.14861985
watch x-men The Last Stand than Dark Phoenix but anyways if you do want to,0.10061474
watch a good x-men movie just watch first class Days of Future past Logan they're,0.10887014
all much better anyways back to the video that was previously edited at the end,0.076130316
of the day Dark Phoenix being good or not it still feels hollow because the,0.083753385
main character Jean Grey has only had one movie to really showcase herself we haven't,0.09635042
gone through a whole journey with her it's only been one movie and she wasn't,0.095866024
even the main star thinking about it now the scene most people remember from her,0.060931135
debut film apocalypse is the scene in which Professor Xavier lost his hair damn it's,0.69542736
like history repeats itself anyways back to Logan because you see Logan is a Rhapsody,0.121223934
it's a film dedicated to showcasing the emotions that Logan goes through and his journey,0.051785614
towards becoming a true hero once again a path which took all of his friends,0.105307125
and in the end the path that takes his life as well at the beginning,0.0698018
of the film he risks his life for a car would he valued most at,0.08287074
the moment and at the end of the film he risks his life for his,0.11777091
heart the end of the movie serves as a Requiem not only for Logan but,0.051204666
for the x-men as well that there's something more than just superhuman they're symbols of,0.09496147
heroism Laura practically turning his grave into a monument showcases this I'm gonna be honest,0.24255045
here on first watch I never really bought Laura and Logan's relationship I felt her,0.099005945
calling Logan dad was way too sudden but upon re-watching it it didn't bother me,0.1222818
as much I do think the movie had to deal with a lot and it,0.067113176
isn't perfect but who was still effective my personal favorite x-men film his first class,0.16804196
but that doesn't mean that movie doesn't have problems to every movie has problems except,0.04248686
for cat one and for me would turn me off a bit from Logan and,0.23498432
still kind of turns me off is how odd it feels to randomly have a,0.15211053
bunch of mutant kids come out in oh where they're talked about in the movie,0.46189916
but their appearance feels a little bit sudden to me but still plot wise it,0.12775642
makes sense as it's Laura's journey to reach them and Logan is ensuring this happens,0.06428256
and they can escape jarring or not it doesn't take away from the fact that,0.041602656
Logan's journey is one of reclaiming his status as a hero as an icon that,0.08261639
has comic books made about him one that isn't defined by his violent past but,0.12167145
a hero that can surpass the horrors that have plagued his life thanks to being,0.15515132
free from a sense of responsibility as he ensures that his daughter and the future,0.1092147
generation will survive he can peacefully die in the closer looks video on Logan which,0.17557679
is fantastic and I urge you to watch it if you haven't it was said,0.115380764
that the MCU would never achieve this sort of finale in which you feel true,0.11586516
closure and in the video Dead that Tony Stark would never have this happened to,0.25150603
him because he just can't die his stories these days aren't dictated by what would,0.16203032
be best for these characters but what is most profitable thankfully the Russos and Kevin,0.07223365
Feige and the rest of those behind endgame decided to tell a fulfilling character-driven story,0.06914688
and not showcase another product and tony dize a good death a poetic death now,0.46683502
while Logan did have his poetic death as well sadly Fox did not do this,0.21135682
for the rest of the x-men because they've kept milking a profitable franchise to me,0.16789266
Logan should have been the end of Bryan Singer's x-men universe but we were hit,0.21517771
with apocalypse and now Dark Phoenix with the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disney,0.104298614
completed the x-men won't get her triumphant last hurrah the x-men will go out in,0.18898465
a whimper and not in the good whimper kind of way as Logan was able,0.12692082
to pull off high stakes without having the and in its third act by going,0.13402078
out in a whimper I mean the x-men property won't get its endgame its Rises,0.15332775
its hidden world it'll get a delayed film that gets memes on all the time,0.18741843
it almost makes me want arc Phoenix to be good because this nearly 20 year,0.06451499
long saga shouldn't end in such a mediocre way but what can you do when,0.46551362
the company only cares about money and not a good film that only goes to,0.14918084
show how powerful Logan is what are the repercussions of being a hero how much,0.0610974
violence can a hero take before they snap in the never-ending battle of good versus,0.15206268
evil does good truly win every time in the end it's all a blur but,0.1725382
there is hope for a brighter future the new generation that pays tribute to the,0.067362994
old one it's a finale to one of the greatest superheroes ever put to screen,0.1404607
one that will go down in history and it also works as a finale to,0.07621966
the x-men a true ending even after the ending of Days of Future past seventeen,0.15468335
years of film finally brought to an end in a very small personal level no,0.07946722
one can just look at Hugh Jackman and see Hugh Jackman anymore they'll always remember,0.058369588
that this dude was once Wolverine he defined the character and he got the beautiful,0.08488963
