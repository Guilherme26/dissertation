hey everyone,0.055095624
it's Alexander the real mr.,0.10544796
Robinson welcome to my channel,0.14590411
and this is my review for singing in the rain which is another first-time viewing experience considering that there's nothing happening out there right now,0.03571833
so this is a movie about Hollywood pretty much,0.08929718
and more specifically it takes place during the era of Hollywood where silent movies are starting to transition into sound our main character is Donald Lockwood played by Gene Kelly,0.063644454
and he is the lead in a film that's being made as a silent film,0.107719
but during this transitional period because of that scene in the jazz singer the production shuts down and the movie has to be retooled to be a talking picture and the movie pretty much follows lockwood his vaudeville partner and best friend played by Donald O'Connor and a young up-and-coming actress played by Debbie Reynolds as they try to work to save the movie and retool it to be a talking film so in the same way I talked about Casablanca yesterday singing in the rain is another movie that I have never seen up until now but it's such an iconic movie that I can recognize a reference to singing in the rain,0.06734924
when I see it more specifically,0.06160493
the famous scene where Gene Kelly is dancing to singing in the rain because there was actually a lot about this movie that to be honest,0.06625035
I didn't expect for one thing I didn't expect this movie to take place in the time period that it takes place this movie came out in 1952,0.08784304
and I assumed that it would be a movie set in the 50s,0.051142015
but I was surprised to find out that it was actually set in the 20s during the silent film era and that it was truly about Hollywood because I literally had no idea of what the plot to this movie was which to be honest is actually one of my disappointments with the movie and it's not really with the movie itself it's just more like the circumstances of when I saw this movie because again this is the first time I've ever seen singing in the rain with no prior knowledge of it outside of the cast and the iconic dancing scene,0.051956233
but when I was watching this movie and watching the plot go along and unfolded,0.08270515
I thought to myself this is the artist this is the plot of the artist where it takes place in the silent era of film,0.065836556
and it's during that transitional period where silent movies are actually starting to die out in favor of talking pictures and again,0.2983966
this is not a fair criticism towards singing in the rain because singing in the rain came first 59 years to be exact but because I saw the artist first the plot to sing in the rain just didn't really leave me with many surprises and to be honest,0.044788457
I thought the artist was actually a lot more compelling in terms of its characters,0.07118968
but again that's not a fair criticism towards singing in the rain at all because it technically was the first movie that came out,0.06833811
and by comparing the two movies you could clearly tell that singing in the rain was a big influence in the making of the artist right down to,0.070461236
the fact that Gene Kelly and John Dujardin look identical,0.08472859
in fact a lot of times when I was watching singing in the rain I kept expecting a French accent to come out of Gene,0.082921915
Kelly because he looked so much like Jean Dujardin or more accurately Jean Dujardin looked a lot like Gene Kelly,0.105093166
and I have some other problems with the movie that I think are legit criticisms but I don't want to talk about those quite yet because this movie is really good this is a lot of fun,0.08147592
and when people say that this is one of the greatest if not the greatest dance movie out there I could definitely believe that and it all has to come down to your main three actors especially Gene Kelly Gene Kelly dancing,0.12434588
in this movie is the stuff of legends,0.1072952
he has energy in him,0.09956817
he is able to take whatever's around him whether it's certain parts of the set or certain props and use those to his advantage to enhance the dancing,0.094900295
and it is just this sounds corny but it's magical to watch him dance and dancing a way to where it looks like he's never tired,0.3309401
you,0.10154687
just have to wonder how many takes did he and the others have to do in order to get those dancing sequences right because that's got to be exhausting,0.062332563
Donald O'Connor is really good in the movie and he manages to keep up with Gene Kelly in terms of dancing,0.1148472
but honestly in terms of a character Donald O'Connor,0.07001483
just didn't really leave that much of an impression on me unlike Debbie Reynolds who is very good in this movie as well and she also manages to stay toe to toe with Gene Kelly in terms of the performances,0.089091845
and I think she's might be my second favorite character in the movie another fantastic actress in this movie is Jean Hagen as Donald Lockwood's co-star in the movie that they're making,0.14927067
and this is one of those characters where I can't stand her because her voice in the movie is the equivalent of Quint scratching on a chalkboard and you just can't stand this woman,0.40338546
she is irritating she's obnoxious and yet she is very very funny,0.69542736
and one of the big plot points in this movie is that she has such an obnoxious voice a voice,0.67339176
that is not made for talking pictures that Debbie Reynolds character actually had to dub her over because the test audiences were laughing at her natural voice and what's really interesting,0.12875475
and ironic about that is that the sequences where Debbie Reynolds is dubbing over Jean,0.08955245
Hagen's character is actually Hagen's natural voice,0.14979364
so that's pretty impressive,0.07946451
and I just recently found out before doing this review that gene Hagen was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars and yeah with the situation like that that's a nomination well deserved,0.10569412
now,0.031218953
I did mention earlier that I had some other issues with this movie which is why I'm not gonna give it my highest rating get off your ass and go see it right now,0.9363906
and this criticism is honestly another one that I can't really blame the movie for because with this criticism you got taken to context the time that this movie was made,0.08002506
and that's the first time that Gene Kelly and Debbie,0.06770184
Reynolds are on screen Gene Kelly is running from a bunch of really crazy fans he jumps,0.63147444
on one of the trolleys and jumps into the passenger seat of Debbie Reynolds car and she's freaking out naturally you got some weird random stranger jumping into her car perfectly but then when she finds out that he's a famous actor,0.3105106
she's calm,0.17159905
she's relaxed and there are several points,0.09158345
during this first meeting where Gene Kelly has his around her and he's getting really close to her and I'm just like oh no not good not good that is you just met this woman stay back man too too soon and again,0.16934618
this is something I really can't blame the movie for it's just the fact that I first watched this movie in a post me too era and it just felt a little creepy watching it in the era that we're in right now,0.0997691
and then there's also one dancing sequence in this movie that I felt was totally unnecessary,0.080749184
it's a sequence where Gene Kelly is describing to the studio head the one final scene that they need to make for the movie,0.05680287
and it's told to this giant what-if scenario and again,0.1000933
it's an amazing dance sequence but I felt like it wasn't natural to the plot and it was just put in there for filler,0.102340326
but outside of that there is absolutely no,0.0716231
denying that this is a great film,0.056894578
it's an incredible dance movie the entire singing in the rain sequence is iconic,0.07784228
the performances are fantastic,0.057762314
it's a lot of fun to watch it's funny even though I'm not gonna give it my highest rating it's still a movie that if you love classic film it's worth seeing in her lifetime,0.13524306
it's not my favorite musical out there,0.045489
I still love movies like West Side Story or Sound of Music a lot more than I do singing in the rain,0.030566173
but there is absolutely no,0.06543867
denying that this movie is fantastic and iconic in its own ways,0.18559656
and there you go that's my review for singing in the rain and much like with Casablanca,0.10238067
this is another movie that Turner Classic Movies is showing on their classic film,0.14811766
festival special home edition,0.070597686
so if you want to see this movie for the first time or again you've got no better chance then later today,0.081395194
