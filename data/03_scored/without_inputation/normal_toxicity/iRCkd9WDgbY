describing exactly what kind of film the shape of water is will be quite difficult on the surface,0.05639087
it's exactly what you might think a cold war-era monster movie might be and it encompasses all of the themes that you'd expect from 1960 to Baltimore,0.25119075
a unifying fear of Russia the expectation of a nuclear family and music by the likes of Glenn Miller but on a less obvious level,0.1462876
it's this fantastic fairy tale that implements narrative elements you might find in stories like Cinderella or Beauty,0.08724316
and the Beast combining these two very opposing story elements has been very well done from the set design cinematography and makeup artists I think were actually able to identify the characteristics of each story element by identifying the colors that I used in the film the primary color scheme for the film shows us that green emerald and teal colors are what encompass all of the film which I mean it's quite obvious throughout its runtime the laboratory and institution very much represent this color scheme along with much more of the film these color combinations are,0.06964245
what's known as analogous on the color wheel by using colors that are close to one another,0.08593743
it creates a calm look that's often found in nature,0.05676336
these colors are found in a lot of the lives of each of the characters Eliza and Zelda where these green uniforms to work giles forces himself to eat key lime pie in order to talk to the server at the diner he even gets told that green is the future by his ex-boss looking at these it seems like all that's coated in green are representations of old world values the server turns out to be homophobic and racist the uniforms that Eliza and Zelda wear for their cleaning jobs are expectations of women in the 60s as well as the need for Giles to change his painting to what his ex boss thinks is the color of a nuclear family type future,0.31089434
I think it's safe to say that throughout the film the green tint to the world that are lies is representative of traditional values that conflicts with her as a character as well as Silva Charles and Dimitri the attitude of these characters reflect the color that they inhabit,0.15549843
this is why red is introduced into the film slowly the color red is accumulated by Eliza as her relationship with the amphibian man develops and she opposes the normal values that everyone around her conforms to I think that the color red was chosen for this representation because it's an opposing color to green on the color wheel which makes Eliza stand out in the film because she isn't a normal character,0.07071231
she's the princess without a voice these colors mirror,0.17991917
the changes that each character goes through the first time Eliza sees the in fit being man,0.092467815
she is cleaning Strickland's blood and slowly through the film she accumulates red shoes a red coat and a red bandana as she falls deeper and deeper in love with the amphibian man,0.14974402
she finds herself to be loved for the first time and fulfills her desire to be understood,0.36733124
by someone she goes from a deaf cleaner to a lover while this is happening the characters around her begin to become themselves and follow in her footsteps Giles,0.26490372
realizes that the diner server isn't who he thought he might be and gives up on the advertising business knowing that they won't hire him because of his sexuality once he sorts to help Eliza,0.33636755
he grows his hair back and ditches his toupee upon realizing his sense of self-worth Dmitry opposes both of his countries in trying to maintain his scientific integrity,0.24107815
Zelda continuously shows her independence in the face of racism and inequality living up to the confrontation with Strickland where she maintains her belief Strickland himself is so obsessed with conformity that he does things that,0.31030795
he hates,0.4516689
he buys a car,0.10448514
that's colored green a color that,0.039980132
he doesn't like simply because he's told that it still,0.12220316
and he's the man of the future,0.07946649
he's in an unhappy marriage with a wife and kids simply because it's what's expected of him,0.28170684
he even tells Dmitri that throughout his entire life,0.18297713
he does what he's told after all of this his confrontation with general Hoyt sets him undone his whole world is a lie because of the people who rejected the norms of society that made it happen,0.18856323
there's a lot to look at in terms of hidden meaning and symbolism in the film this was linguist Ferdinand de Saussure argues for what's known as semiotic theory that would explain a lot of what we see in the shape of water,0.050720364
he argues that we will always see a signifier which is the form a sign will take place in this sign is to signify it a concept that the form represents which I know is a bit confusing but it's pretty simple,0.071679875
in reality an example of this would be the eggs that are continuously featured in the film in reality,0.10852802
there's no reason,0.0582542
why would call them eggs other than it was once decided by someone that that's what they're called and so eggs could carry any other meaning that we would give them,0.16587497
and so the meaning that we give them is carried by the letters that make up the name for an egg,0.15457161
in this case fertility might be attached to the eggs in this film,0.15425092
Eliza begins her relationship with the amphibian man by giving him her eggs and as her relationship progresses,0.3667268
she will eventually give him her other eggs in this scene we see Eliza waiting for her bus to come sitting next to her is a man waiting with a cake,0.26948115
this could be as simple for the majority of people having a desire for a lot of different things in a person whereas Eliza only carries eggs just having a single ingredient,0.08029392
please her short of wanting what everyone else wants this could be what she wants in the InfiniBand semiotic theory can be used to explain the way that green of red are implemented into the film the meticulous design of the world that these characters inhabit tells us a story that only the medium of film is able to get across I'm so glad that the filmmakers could tell us this fairy tale in a wholly unique way thanks everyone for watching the video up until this point,0.07434262
