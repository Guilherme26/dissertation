seeing wonder woman leap into action and those moments are very carefully placed throughout a,0.12250915
very thoughtful and engaging story make no mistake above all wonder woman is a great,0.14228483
story but still when she leaps into action it is something that I will never,0.0787569
forget having witnessed and then I never ever will get tired of seeing you know,0.13908884
everything that's ever been said about Wonder Woman how she represents women and what they,0.20506199
can and should be I got to admit in the past sometimes I rolled my,0.18095632
eyes when that's been discussed but here I finally get it she finally I think,0.10304413
has become what she was always intended to be and I have gone from thinking,0.15420796
that Wonder Woman is okay she has her moments to her actually challenging Batman I,0.1178124
can't believe I'm saying this as my favorite superhero I'm not just talking about raw,0.09594736
power although it's an impressive display year but also her ideology that we get to,0.10701831
see take shape before us and I think that in seeing that ideology take shape,0.12065054
we can better understand it and not roll our eyes at it that makes a,0.06970657
lot more sense now when I got out of the press screening we were allowed,0.049136285
to tweet about the movie the social and gargle had been lifted and I said,0.10588542
it's one of the best movies not just DC EU or Cod book movies that,0.08646863
I've ever seen and one of you tweeted me back J's Lewis and Meryl and,0.15548521
you were like Citizen Kane vertigo Seven Samurai Wonder Woman and I say no not,0.24402668
Citizen Kane I would say more The Little Mermaid Indiana Jones and inglorious basterds I,0.50644493
had to choose that last one very carefully and I set a lot of glorious,0.07039619
bastards for several reasons one humor this is a very funny movie uh to that,0.8606264
it rewrites history you know inglorious basterds played with history and of course this movie,0.3874114
plays without the history of World War one but always very respectfully and also a,0.080809474
love of old movies there's a real Turner Classic Movies feel to this Wonder Woman,0.15112558
that just permeates the entire film there are scenes that would feel right at home,0.056569934
you know both romantic scenes and scenes about war on Turner Classic Movies it's and,0.15417978
if you're a fan of Turner Classic Movies oh you're just going to be an,0.10066097
absolute odd they've been able to fold that into a comic book movie we talked,0.0943192
about playing with genres right like oh this is a spy comic book movie this,0.12512091
is a horror comic book movie this is a Western comic book movie this is,0.31089434
an old-fashioned comic book movie and you're Batman V Superman I imply applauded for its,0.23066019
ambition but this again it's not only very old-fashioned filmmaking but it has a distinct,0.10410262
female point of view now in the past that has meant a grading viewpoint men,0.24128895
vs. women a lot of negative connotations and interestingly for the most part up until,0.24555807
now or this year feminism and popular entertainment has actually been crafted by men including,0.17336944
Wonder Woman herself throughout the decades mostly male creators but here patty Jenkins and gal,0.10697029
gadot and also Emma Watson asked I have to give a shout out and how,0.19086829
she shaped Belle because I think this is all part of the same movement are,0.3376884
able to finally put feminism a brand of feminism in popular culture that is productive,0.12114084
and admirable instead of destructive and grading and now so exciting I think this is,0.18479839
the feminism that so many of us have been fighting for and whenever we see,0.24428514
these some of you recently have said grace you seem very upset with female characters,0.24852666
lately and it's because I'm like that is not where I want representing feminism it,0.31089434
makes me look bad and makes all women look bad this this and Belle please,0.5149186
look to this this is what I want to define feminism and back to that,0.15411416
journey that this movie has you take I think that's really important because instead of,0.085306436
just showing you the destination by having you take the journey of feministic thought I,0.5569585
think it because are accessible to some people who maybe previously have rolled their eyes,0.09201263
effect I think that every woman who watches Wonder Woman would hope that she shares,0.24741301
many of the same qualities and I also think that they would look at her,0.20165594
relationship with Steve Trevor as an ideal relationship of partners it's so amazing and I,0.028855722
want to take a just a slight moment a moment here before we get into,0.095426895
Steve Trevor I have so much to say about Steve Trevor I really want to,0.050135527
point out that well patty Jenkins is the driving creative force here it is very,0.079634614
important to note that the screenplay and the story are entirely written by men and,0.08982607
it is very much the message of this movie that it's best when men and,0.15403503
women work together and it both have something to offer and that both are corruptible,0.526386
very important there's been a lot of talk about you know gender separation and that's,0.18407236
that's the pepper feminism we're trying to move away from okay now make no mistake,0.2620601
this is very much Steve Trevor's movie just as much as it is Wonder Woman's,0.0865375
and as much as this movie maybe a fan of Wonder Woman it made me,0.1668502
that much a fan of Steve Trevor he is her Lois Lane well what Lois,0.0425441
Lane used to be quite tragically in fact Lois Lane has been sidelined these days,0.11098008
nowhere near the reporter she once was but she said but Steve Trevor he's never,0.09709812
been so much of a spy before a man of action he was just so,0.14213029
great and he's every bit as appealing and vibrant as Lois Lane is in her,0.13706103
best stories but unlike Lois sometimes Steve leads and sometimes Wonder Woman leads they have,0.062017903
a pretty good dance going on and once you see the movie you'll understand that,0.11342851
reference and also so importantly Steve Trevor is instrumental in shaping Wonder Woman's ideology he,0.029475097
is an incredibly important figure in her life beyond their romance now speaking of Lois,0.15176256
and romance you might recall that in the original Superman movie which is hugely influential,0.06715816
on patty Jenkins as you can tell when you see this film there was a,0.07612149
pretty risque line about what color Lois's panties are you know x-ray vision and all,0.31089434
that and this movie is just as playful what's so much more risque I was,0.13298412
shocked at some of the things they put they put in here let's just say,0.086569615
that Wonder Woman is very curious and Steve Trevor is more than happy to explain,0.075268395
I I was just it was just crazy but I have to tell you it,0.27820516
was so much fun and it was so incredibly romantic I'm like like Titanic level,0.096243404
romance I was amazed at how romantic this film is this is a fantastic date,0.06894398
movie but because of some of the risque lines I would advise anyone thinking of,0.07918172
taking young children that they might want to see this movie first just to make,0.20714289
sure they're okay with some of the things that are referenced in here you might,0.07543404
be like really in a comic book movie in a DC in you movie they,0.17481938
would really do that yes let's just say there's Princeton some reference to some male,0.24210927
anatomy it's um it's thinly veiled and it's done in a comedic fashion but it's,0.106670864
there so I only asked for golga dodge I get so many questions about golga,0.0958118
dot as to whether or not she's up to up to this role and let,0.076689675
me tell you she is as much Wonder Woman as Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones,0.23962778
and Christopher Reeve is Superman from her action scenes too sitting in a bar with,0.090966694
Steve and his crew planning a mission to arguing with a British general one of,0.06455518
my favorite scenes in the movie every single movement from gal gadot rings true after,0.08818915
the action scenes while they are used sparingly they are masterfully woven into the story,0.06691522
I would say there's an Indiana Jones desk ratio of action to story and it,0.058053605
works just as it doesn't Indiana Jones but when there is action again it is,0.030310815
a wonder to behold and that third act boy oh I don't want to ruin,0.27938363
it for you we will discuss it at length in the spoiler review but let,0.05788286
me just tell you it definitely raises the bar and it definitely delivers and still,0.054572247
it manages to be faithful to this old-fashioned storytelling which is very impressive but I,0.07106147
have to also add that I actually enjoyed some of the quieter moments in the,0.060595676
movie just as much there are some beautiful and poignant things said and done that,0.0378007
are just so moving and also so haunting we have a lot to discuss in,0.05312784
the spoiler review these damn gauntlets I hope they're making too much noise while I,0.7093121
move Wonder Woman's like you know moving magic keeps my armor from distracting from my,0.17689195
dialogue but anyway I also wanted to add the Wonder Woman isn't just about taking,0.18314625
but and strength she has always been about also loving compassion and I personally have,0.061437108
felt that that it's held the character back in the past ivenn like you have,0.0637207
to choose you know I think that your love and compassion is holding you back,0.08149042
Wonder Woman but just as I said I enjoyed some of the quieter moments in,0.14931636
the movie as much as the action sequences that just that that embodies Wonder Woman,0.101878695
herself and I finally see the beauty of that balance between kicking button strength and,0.14135383
loving comparison and I not only see it as a benefit to the character but,0.043009855
it's a benefit to humanity to you to me and the fact that that movie,0.12062005
this movie was able to make such a strong impression on me and I think,0.14880043
particularly at this moment in time is really something amazing you know what I'm just,0.052682698
going to do it I'm going to take the dark night out of my list,0.31089434
of top three films of all time I've said before everyone has it's hard to,0.08906926
choose just one but everybody can choose their top three films of all time to,0.065102816
triangulate them as who they are as a movie goer and so I'm taking the,0.47296742
dark night out with all due respect and I'm putting Wonder Woman in as one,0.15453003
of my top three films of all time I just think it's that spectacular so,0.10477765
that's my review of Wonder Woman a film that I feel is absolutely perfect well,0.10398124
it has two little small problems which we'll discuss in the spoiler review but I,0.06291954
can't wait and discuss it with you down below if you're if you've seen the,0.24106097
movie do not ruin it for people save your spoilery comments for the spoiler review,0.14014734
and one last thing a lot of times you guys ask me to to your,0.16131076
3d and as I always say if the studio I let the student dealer's choice,0.07032609
right the studio put it in 2d for the press screening and as you can,0.069296755
see I had a wonderful time so that is what I would recommend for this,0.07602687
all right so much Wonder Woman coverage coming all week we are going to have,0.13163146
ourselves as I tweeted an amazonian time but right now in this moment I want,0.06226169
to harken back to something pretty amazing that happened on Twitter about a month or,0.1039914
so ago you might recall this woman named Karen Bradley her sister was a huge,0.34227076
Wonder Woman fan and she was unfortunately awful quite sick and it was one of,0.46170563
her final wishes to get the chance to see this movie unfortunately Melissa did not,0.18039559
get to see Wonder Woman but the outpouring of support that was shown to her,0.1143187
through my tweets and year tweet so many of you tweeted about it really meant,0.06534537
so much to her and I've kept in touch with her sister Karen and I,0.28168955
asked Karen for this review to tell us a little bit about Melissa send me,0.14896443
some photos that I can share them with you so that she could be a,0.10284628
part of this experience anyway and I have to tell you I was just so,0.048726432
absolutely moved by what Karen sent me I can't do it justice I'm going to,0.09715446
put it up on the screen and what I think it's just such an appropriate,0.07942676
ending for a review of this film because it fits so beautifully and it's just,0.1536861
such a perfect embodiment of sisterhood human spirit faith and the character faith and patty,0.08264679
Jenkins faith and what's in doing what's right that it is incredibly moving and I,0.10460802
think that particularly once you see the movie you'll see just how fitting and appropriate,0.13690467
this is so I again let's like Karen and her sisters honor wrap this up,0.10529956
