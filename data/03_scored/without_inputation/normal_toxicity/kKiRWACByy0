based on a 1942 short story by Cornell Woolrich called it had to be murder,0.35109368
the big thing that the short story and the film have in common is the,0.022955572
central conflict in which lb Jefferies suspects one of his neighbors of murdering his bedridden,0.43400687
wife after forming his theory Jefferies spends most of his time searching for clues by,0.07155523
spying through his camera lens to eventually uncover the sinister truth however the more interesting,0.15164399
part to me is where these two stories are different and that's the element of,0.020919064
romance as we've touched on already a lot of the characters in Hitchcock's film are,0.0602116
involved in a relationship of some kind notably and most importantly our main character lb,0.028376771
Jefferies who is pretty much ready to give up on his dating relationship with his,0.15396936
girlfriend Lisa you'd think that since this element of romantic love is such a prominent,0.12497492
part of the film upfront there would be some semblance of it in the short,0.06225798
story right but that's not the case at all in fact the character of Lisa,0.05957067
is completely absent from the short story which instead leans completely on the thrills and,0.076273136
suspense of Jefferies playing private investigator and of course Cornell Woolrich the author of the,0.11370808
short story executes this to great effect in fact I included a link to the,0.05637028
free PDF version in the description if you'd like to check it out yourself but,0.14601752
the absence of romance in the short story is all the more telling that it's,0.038615067
inclusion in the movie was a very deliberate choice by Hitchcock so what kind of,0.12480145
love story was Hitchcock trying to tell here well let's take a look at the,0.057408735
first act to learn what kind of relationship Jefferies and Lisa have at the beginning,0.07342816
of the story we know from what we see in the opening shots that Jefferies,0.089987576
is an accomplished and well-traveled photographer and prides himself as a free spirit and an,0.037507992
adventurer in fact the reason he broke his Lake in the first place was because,0.06876187
he put himself in harm's way to get that perfect photo but when it comes,0.17890243
to Lisa he doesn't seem to think she's very interested in getting her hands dirty,0.6049727
with a mess of adventure she's just not the girl for me yeah she's not,0.5021582
me perfect she's too perfect she's too talented she's too beautiful she's too sophisticated she's,0.25946015
too everything but what I want while this relationship dynamic is being set up Hitchcock,0.07694724
periodically gives us glimpses into the lives of the neighbors including one who seems less,0.075775124
concerned with his surroundings than anyone else a musician now in the beginning of the,0.07988554
film we can see and hear that this guy is beginning to compose a piece,0.1254968
of music on a piano we only hear bits and pieces and kind of get,0.13467216
the impression that there's still a lot of work to be done before the song,0.063185364
will be complete as he fishes around for a melody the inclusion of the musician,0.0821991
might initially seem like just another part of the neighborhood flavor but before we explore,0.07805391
exactly why this character is so significant let's bounce back over to the relationship between,0.05943278
Jefferies and Lisa a few scenes later we see that a lot of Geoffrey's doubts,0.08037212
about their future seem to be justified although they clearly have affection for each other,0.13039666
lisa has high-class tastes and seems preoccupied with things that are frivolous in the eyes,0.26769084
of Jefferies both of which contrasts with his modest and down-to-earth personality can you see,0.13400276
me driving down to the fashion salon and a jeep wearing combat boots on a,0.14106569
three-day beard this disagreement sends an already tense relationship into further turmoil and we feel,0.07534461
the frustration between them both now it's at about this time that Hitchcock guides our,0.11773847
attention back to the musician who's continuing to work on his piece of music but,0.084059425
we see that he's dealing with some frustration of his own at this point we,0.12427602
can start to connect the dots that the progression of the musician's songwriting is developing,0.055078298
in tandem with the relationship of our main characters following it from a vulnerable place,0.04979311
where it was still new and clunky to a place where it's on the verge,0.24045148
of falling apart this connection between music and character becomes even more apparent at around,0.1028745
the story's halfway point when Lisa has finally accepted that thorwald is acting suspiciously and,0.0849392
she decides to break into the man's apartment to dig for clues and evidence herself,0.17520988
as Jefferies watches helplessly from across the courtyard we hear the musicians piece of music,0.09338192
more prominently than ever before and it's now starting to show signs of growth and,0.07404868
progress this resonates directly with the progression of our main characters relationship because this is,0.032637514
the moment when Jefferies realizes that Lisa is willing to take a step in his,0.07725157
direction and embrace risk and adventure to things that he didn't see in her before,0.07486654
and then at the very end of the story after the terrifying face-to-face confrontation in,0.14974053
which Jefferies is thrown out of his apartment by thorwald who is subsequently arrested we,0.102882355
hear the completed version of the musician song play in all of its glory and,0.0637265
what do you know the name of the song finally becomes clear I can't tell,0.059068333
you what this music is meant to me while this reinforces the idea that the,0.14178933
relationship between Lisa and Jefferies has now fully blossomed we know that it's just the,0.05413445
beginning for them as if to acknowledge this Hitchcock gives us one final image Lisa,0.08658988
dressed in more casual clothing reads an adventurous book about the Himalayas indicating that she's,0.13119942
changed and is now embracing some of Geoffrey's values but the shot becomes more interesting,0.08346043
when she eventually puts her book down in favour of a fashion magazine yes she's,0.1539616
now embraced a lot of what Jefferies is passionate about but she's also preserved an,0.06136646
important part of herself in the process so many elements of this film managed to,0.06929614
say so much without a single word being spoken the opening shots of Jeffrey's apartment,0.11525229
informing us of his normal world and values the progression of the musicians song reinforcing,0.06854638
the ups and downs of our primary character relationship and our final image of Lisa,0.07556923
that somehow manages to capture the complexity of what it means to love someone all,0.070383675
of this demonstrates that Alfred Hitchcock isn't just the master of suspense but moreover a,0.05563745
