hey everybody today I'm going to be reviewing Mad Max fury road and I know,0.19175994
I'm so late hun reviewing this I know everyone's already seen it but I kept,0.043393906
getting request after request after request to review this movie so here I am I'm,0.054358684
devoted one of the reasons it took me so long to actually go see the,0.075286485
movies because I was a complete Mad Max virgin I we hadn't even made it,0.53490317
to first base I knew nothing about Mad Max I didn't even know Mel Gibson,0.22070509
was in it and I know that's kind of lame to admit but I just,0.40013853
I didn't really grow up with a lot of cult action movies as a kid,0.09143451
so I just never got introduced to it and you know what's so great about,0.10536859
this movie is that you don't have to have much backstory at all if any,0.15273657
to enjoy it and I think a lot of that comes from the simplicity of,0.05988897
the storyline the movie is just kind of one big climax that is stripped to,0.07061424
the bare-bones in terms of the plot you've got your protagonist which is max obviously,0.13468164
and he is a prisoner that is escaping from this tyrannical civilization that it's kind,0.4454857
of like a cross between Tatooine and Geonosis he is escaped and he is helped,0.0704251
by a woman named furiosa played by Charlize Theron and the whole movie is basically,0.11510368
just them trying to survive and they're being chased that's it some may say that,0.07157981
the plot is too simplistic and I couldn't disagree more I actually think ironically it's,0.11015654
very refreshing to see a movie an action movie know exactly what it is and,0.068595074
so it just keeps everything to the minimum in terms of how complicated the plot,0.064705595
is because I feel like nowadays all I see and I'm getting so sick of,0.1505412
it are these overly complicated plots and these movies these action movies that have so,0.08668963
much CGI no personality at all they're just like these cold corporate things that are,0.17427914
just kind of shoved out on an assembly line and this movie basically just Christ,0.16783623
Faolain all that Mad Max is a no-holds-barred blockbuster flick and it's gritty it's relentless,0.3543097
it's bombastic and all of this in the best possible way and it's one of,0.08477549
the best action movies I've seen a long long time I watched some of the,0.046804693
making of behind the scenes footage and from what I understand there's very little CGI,0.0947443
going on here and that is so great because to me you just can't I,0.15296578
mean at least right now I mean maybe in the future we will be able,0.06270691
to be more evolved in terms of the technology but right now you just can't,0.07898886
capture the personality and the detail of things with a computer everything here just looks,0.07418921
so real and authentic the atmosphere of it is incredible so creative they look like,0.045313418
they put so much effort into everything everything from the cars to the makeup and,0.04556016
the weapons everything it's just so over the top and it you feel like you,0.17496388
while you're watching it you feel like you're at the most adrenaline infused operatic rock,0.101793446
concert ever and actually there is even a guy who is you know on top,0.1475564
of one of the vehicles with a guitar electric guitar and there's fire coming out,0.14524889
of it and he's just like and as soon as I saw that I was,0.08542981
just like yes by that point you know exactly what kind of movie it is,0.068916924
and you just kind of have to go in headfirst and I think that the,0.32895193
cacophonous nature of the visual storytelling is balanced so well with what I said before,0.08445782
that simple story that's more kind of in the revenge Kill Bill style and each,0.31798217
character has something that is at stake or desires something that we can all connect,0.046825454
to emotionally you mean you've got max who's just trying to escape and he's got,0.15703663
all of this you know post-traumatic stress I guess you could say he's just basically,0.140714
wanting to be liberated from this oppressive society and then you got Nicholas Hoult character,0.28054506
who is quite manic and naive and he just wants to stand for something he,0.6859612
wants his life to have meaning before he dies and in there's furiosa who is,0.34244767
one of the female characters Charlize Theron and this character has been talked about a,0.10937826
lot I think more than any other aspect of the movie and actually somebody on,0.09283468
YouTube asked me what I thought about the if I thought it was feminist or,0.31089434
or what I think the movie is feminist but really I don't think it's consciously,0.48645267
I think it's just a movie that has happens to have very strong female characters,0.21274629
it and it's one of the very few films to portray a female in a,0.18839967
very realistic light as as realistic as Mad Max could be and it is not,0.12527008
feminist propaganda like some people think it is and because it's capturing all kinds of,0.407574
different archetypes and how females are portrayed in different ways furiosa is just one of,0.23992842
the most badass female action heroes I've ever seen I mean she's tough and very,0.39453337
androgynous she's got a shaved head that's kind of been that Maria Falcon Eddie style,0.34189683
and if you get that reference there aren't any moments at least that I remember,0.037486047
watching the movie where she was once objectified where they even referred to her as,0.11553169
a female there isn't any competition or you know sexual tension that you usually see,0.55024785
in these kinds of action movies and Max and period as equals and I guess,0.0596155
the feminist aspect of the movie that we are all seeing is that furiosa is,0.24191783
trying to free all of these sex slaves basically there are these female slaves that,0.74282867
have this captor and the slave women even though they may be scantily clad and,0.5283153
they may not have the prowess of curiosa they do have their own kind of,0.16295463
resourceful qualities so the movie is showing us different facets to masculinity and femininity like,0.26241472
on one hand George Miller the director is trying to show us women who are,0.15077007
able to prevail in a masculine environment and then other times I don't want to,0.08052205
give it away and I want to give away spoilers but other women do fall,0.5531021
victim to it and he's also showing us the pros and cons to an overtly,0.3049377
masculine world yes there may be a lot of very gruff masculine villains in the,0.23900667
movie but yet you do have a very mess man at the forefront of the,0.26131344
film max so the whole thing is very rounded it builds with tension in a,0.07330557
way that is very exciting and it's got an amazing flow to it it's got,0.078777164
an accessible storyline as I said that people can latch on to and even though,0.06916798
the plot is very similar to things that we see we've seen in the past,0.049461763
it doesn't have any of those action cliches that we're so used to like the,0.106485024
catch phrases and things like that it's so raw and entertaining and yet it feels,0.104135625
like it was made by human hands which unfortunately is rare in this day and,0.26890308
age to me it has all the makings of a classic so yeah it's just,0.10842539
