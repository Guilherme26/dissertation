what's going on people Mike see town here where I'm gonna be discussing the new,0.058743697
Jordan Peele film us before I get into that I want to say that I,0.095989324
reviewed this on the frames-per-second podcast so make sure you guys go check that out,0.026165664
link will be down there but I also wanted to make a video about this,0.034360062
- jumping into it us is the second horror film from Jordan Peele third film,0.05380604
in general as he also did Keanu but he was also known for his jokey,0.041150257
and Peele but I've never actually seen that show I didn't know anything about this,0.025850367
guy until he did get out which I loved which I also reviewed so I'll,0.05073821
link that down there as well but because I love get out so much I,0.06438845
had really really high expectations for this one and before we get into this review,0.034004852
there will be spoilers so if you have not seen the movie turn this off,0.06921103
go watch the movie and then come back so us is the story of Adelaide,0.045108765
played by Lupita Nyong'o her husband Gabe played by Winston Duke and their two children,0.0980647
Jason and Zora they go up to Santa Cruz California to their vacation home to,0.05443198
kind of chill out but while there they encountered their doppelgangers and a whole lot,0.0907989
of crazy happens I look like I need to tell you the entire story if,0.08539694
you saw it you know it if you didn't see it you need to go,0.04329747
watch it but I think the main part of the story evolved around who the,0.03694829
doppelgangers or the tethered are the tethered or group that lives underground they're in some,0.07047288
way tied to their above-ground counterparts and what the above-ground twins do is mimicked by,0.05327722
the tethered no matter how weird or awkward it is later in the film we,0.023749717
come to find out that the tethered are a scientific experiment in cloning that's why,0.028278952
we see so many rabbits and at first I thought it was because rabbits were,0.026794927
some of the first animals to be cloned but I was actually wrong about that,0.040791057
I now think it's just because rabbits reproduce so rapidly so it makes sense to,0.1047305
use them especially if we're talking about feeding the other tethers anyway the scientists moved,0.054747276
on from cloning animals and were semi-successful in cloning the humans they were identical counterparts,0.050946414
to their above-ground twins except they weren't able to talk never really explains why but,0.06494653
I kind of have an idea we'll get to that later but at some point,0.034191106
the tethered decide that they're gonna go up of ground because they're tired of living,0.08046926
below ground and living a relatively shitty life while their above-ground twins are living great,0.6220468
lives so they decide to come above Brown and start murdering their twins with scissors,0.5025409
so let me say I loved this movie while I was excited to see it,0.057824414
I was also a bit nervous I didn't want this to be drastically worse then,0.05250095
get out and then Jordan peel is looked at as a one-hit wonder and then,0.042912994
his career within horror movies is over but even outside of looking at the symbolism,0.054050162
which we'll get into I thought this was a very entertaining movie it had plenty,0.04598082
of drama it had some comedy but it was it was tense and it definitely,0.030293794
kept you on the edge of your seat was the perfect film no it was,0.049224254
not I didn't have a new small issues with it if he listened to the,0.018211398
podcast you'll know that one of my issues with the movie was game the father,0.03622324
he was incredibly annoying throughout this movie and I understand that he was written this,0.22228043
way on purpose as a way to prop up Lupita nyong'o's character or maybe even,0.029913308
to prop up black women in general um but after shooting the podcast and driving,0.37256736
home and thinking about it more I now realized that he was kind of representing,0.042845145
how women are treated in horror movies they're looked at as dumb they're looked at,0.47528994
as useless as pointless and this kind of made me think about the part where,0.26352105
he's kind of trying to sexualize the situation by laying on the bed and kind,0.31339288
of spreading his legs yeah that's what women would do in horror movies you know,0.4144292
and I was thinking before that it was too much that it was too obvious,0.038756926
that he's this this big buffoon who gets hit in the leg one time and,0.41587725
he spends the rest of the movie kind of whining and crying and crawling on,0.2006859
the ground making dumb jokes at completely inopportune times and yeah that's how women are,0.46011084
in horror movies I feel like Jordan Peele was giving us a taste of our,0.043238267
own medicine and yes it was extremely annoying but now I see that that was,0.05286015
probably the whole point so I feel like he did his job there and that,0.026021319
part no longer bothers me I also feel like they should have left out the,0.051748626
part that definitively tells us that a delay was switched out I think could have,0.019549083
left that to us to figure out you know one example I gave on podcast,0.043244254
was Deckard from Blade Runner you know the movie gives slight implications that may imply,0.029479608
that that Deckard is actually a replicant but it doesn't say for sure so this,0.05584283
gives us years of wandering and rewatching and discussing and it contributes to the cult,0.047681693
status of that film and I think without giving us the answer so definitively the,0.0197952
idea of Adelaide being a tethered would give us the same feeling that Deckard being,0.07825021
a replicant did but there's another idea that wasn't definitively given that I feel like,0.018718267
could give us that same feeling but we'll get to that in a minute my,0.035637215
only other issue was the impracticality of certain things like how would cloning Adelaide and,0.04540344
Gabe result in their kids being exact clones it would be different if Adelaide and,0.0491584
her clone red hadn't actually given birth to the kids but they did the kids,0.07094383
weren't cloned later on so it didn't really make sense but those are extremely small,0.028132612
gripes because I'm totally fine with suspending disbelief for within horror movies especially if I,0.099801496
really enjoyed the film now let's talk about the details of the film so I,0.016879035
did love this movie when I first left the theater I was kind of mad,0.06716492
on the whole thing I thought it was cool and I thought it was a,0.023146395
fun ride but it didn't really click I didn't really get it I had to,0.021414258
think about it long and hard on my ride home and that's when things started,0.06154279
to come together and the more they came together the more I loved this movie,0.0414283
once I started to think about the details of the story my mind started going,0.024635077
crazy so we all know that Adelaide was switched out with her underground clone so,0.07999366
when you think back to the beginning how when young Adelaide was found she wouldn't,0.015257318
talk and that's because the tethered don't talk Adelaide had to learn how to talk,0.030312419
to you she also tells Kitty the mom of the white family they're friends with,0.1489253
that she has a hard time talking to people again because The Temper don't talk,0.059670962
even though you'd think that she'd kind of be over that by now as she's,0.04250457
been above-ground for what we could guess would be at least 20 years also there's,0.021341087
the scene in the car where she's teaching her son Jason how to snap along,0.038099058
- I got five on it I noticed while watching that that she was totally,0.05241115
off beat and I thought that maybe it was just me being too critical and,0.08343332
that it wasn't a big deal but it is actually a big deal because she's,0.04456265
offbeat due to the fact that she's not of this world her her wiring isn't,0.08835102
like ours so even though she's able to pretend with certain things other things just,0.06455807
don't connect for another thing that I mentioned on the frame for second podcast review,0.020709828
about this is my idea that Jason the son was also a tethered I can't,0.044257995
say for certain but many things this movie gave me this impression once I started,0.04125203
to think back on it first off when he's on the beach he's not building,0.052929327
a sandcastle he's building a sand tunnel and it didn't connect at first but it,0.040271547
does once the movies over and you look back at everything just like when Jason,0.03620528
says certain things like kiss my anus and is his parents are like where the,0.74428785
hell did you get that from and then they say he's been acting weird since,0.3629792
the previous summer but they simply think it's because his grandmother died I think it's,0.07177265
because he was switched out that previous summer there's also the thing about the magic,0.018591218
trick toy that he has he says he remembers playing with it but he doesn't,0.06727069
remember what it does and that's because he doesn't know but because his above-ground twin,0.11239076
was playing with it he sort of knows how it works but when we look,0.021516696
at Jason's tethered his face is all burned up and I think that's because while,0.39698356
this Jason was above-ground playing with the little toy his twin was below ground mimicking,0.093790896
him but he was playing with matches and he ends up burning his face I,0.46645314
also think another indication of Jason being switched out is he's the first to say,0.0232495
it's us when the tennard show up he seems to be the least freaked out,0.042756673
at first you know Adelaide is so weirded out because I think she doesn't really,0.05348409
remember that she's a tethered because it happened so long ago she it starts to,0.04184271
come back to her later on in the movie but it's been so recent with,0.054074775
Jason that he knows the whole time but at the end when Adelaide looks back,0.022467908
at Jason and she gives him that kind of sinister smile that kind of tells,0.11822442
the audience that she's a tethered Jason doesn't say anything he just lowers his mask,0.06526649
kind of indicating that he's going back to masking the fact that he's a tethered,0.06628887
to now let's talk a bit about the symbolism in this movie the first big,0.049806956
one that we see is the homeless guy holding the sign that says Jeremiah 11,0.032402426
you know there are many interpretations of this verse depending on which version of the,0.016168619
Bible that you're reading but I found this one and I think it seems to,0.056427527
fit the movie the most behold I'm bringing disaster and suffering on them which they,0.1863818
will not be able to escape though they cry to me I will not listen,0.061741017
to them the interesting thing is the other places the 11:11 appear the attack also,0.09498357
seems to happen at 11:11 p.m. but one of them that kind of me up,0.11118079
was during the fair in 1986 when the fathers playing whack-a-mole the guy that hands,0.10565178
in the ticket is wearing a black flag shirt so me being a nerdy punk,0.2869848
of course I noticed that and I'm like no that's pretty cool kind of like,0.04267419
a random reference until later we see one of the real light twins in the,0.027019095
Tyler family the white family they're wearing a black flag t-shirt and I noticed that,0.26574746
and it took me forever to figure out why you know I know a bit,0.03539775
about black flag but I was never a big fan of theirs so I was,0.045664858
looking at songs and song titles trying to figure this out until I looked at,0.01481364
the logo it had a huge dub moment for bars 11:11 such a dope little,0.19960831
nugget for Jordan Peele to throw in there the significance of eleven eleven outside the,0.24332614
verse itself saying that the tethered are bringing evil onto the world and they won't,0.084560804
be stopped I think the number eleven eleven is obviously a take on the whole,0.04600876
twin thing you know eleven eleven is the same no matter how you flip it,0.05940755
the scissors I knew there had to be a reason as to why they were,0.047648434
using scissors to attack people but I couldn't figure it out until the scene where,0.3045455
red cuts the paper dolls then it dawned on me that the scissors were a,0.06853387
representation of severing the above ground people from their tethered twins that's why they specifically,0.068327
use the scissors to kill them this is them breaking that connection between the tethered,0.66112524
and the above-ground people now why they specifically killed people by stabbing them in the,0.63576055
necks especially with the Tyler family that part kind of confused me so if anybody,0.1477772
has any ideas on that please drop a comment down there Hands Across America so,0.076283924
this was an 80s campaign that I'm actually old enough to remember it was geared,0.028759215
at raising money for the hungry and the homeless and in US red used this,0.028652785
idea of Hands Across America a way of fixing the issue of the tethered being,0.03257604
the hungry and the homeless as they have no home since they've been living in,0.0740855
the tunnels and eating nothing but raw rabid while their counterparts live above ground eating,0.25361335
whatever they want chud so there were a few movies that were seen at the,0.025718661
very beginning of the film if you play it close enough attention chug being one,0.02906786
of my favorite horror movies that one jumped out at me you know judge is,0.038723666
a story of these creatures who live underground and homeless people are fed to them,0.115678094
we're laying to the idea that the tethered being homeless and living underground I kind,0.048364174
of think it's obvious as to why that movie is a big reference so what,0.023131762
do the tethered represent to me they represent impoverished disenfranchised or marginalized people you know,0.07782782
us could also be seen as u.s. United States Adelaide even says when they're asked,0.065047644
who they are you know she says we're Americans the tethered represent this idea of,0.037079997
these people who have been here as long as we have but we treat them,0.052472346
like others like outsiders the same way immigrants black folks gays or any marginalized group,0.62341076
is treated which gives the movie a whole new meaning when we consider who we're,0.016320946
supposed to root for in this movie are these people really coming to the surface,0.05409739
just to hurt people with no reason like the media tells us in real life,0.3344776
and in this film or is this justifiable revenge why don't the tethered talk well,0.18137297
disenfranchised people typically don't have a voice until someone from outside of their group is,0.076944456
chosen to speak for them we have to remember red is from above ground she's,0.033404857
technically an outsider to them so the fact that she's the one that speaks for,0.022662807
them I think it says a lot I could totally keep going but I'm gonna,0.038870007
stop there I'm just gonna say again that I loved this movie I like to,0.046145786
get out more because I related to it more but I still thought that US,0.044919185
was an amazing twist on the horror genre the reason being is he has a,0.056773424
voice that is missed in horror for the most part horror has always had socially,0.049528908
conscious films Night of the Living Dead and Candyman are a few but Jordan Peele,0.13496244
is presenting a narrative that solely missed you know the horror movies with with black,0.11532156
people as the center who are not based on stipulations or stereotypes I think that's,0.054028213
really really dope as our horror movies that really make you think about real life,0.07328129
without giving everything to you on an easy platter so I support this fully so,0.109319605
make sure you guys go see this movie then be sure to come back and,0.061454985
let me know what you guys thought of it and let me know if I,0.02970178
missed any of the references or any of the symbolism drop some comments down there,0.019261058
in the comments section but yeah that's it as usual thank you for looking thank,0.0074407444
you for loving thank you for being you and I'll see you guys next time,0.101616114
