what's up guys it's well back again and today's review is the latest installment in,0.08588086
the Marvel Cinematic Universe Thor Ragnarok Dora bagging rock the third installment in the Thor,0.10696388
franchise directed by Taika Waititi kicks off when the evil hella invades Asgard hella the,0.3169399
goddess of death seeks to rule Asgard and many other lands in an attempt to,0.25491303
establish her dominance over the nine realms and bring death to those that defy her,0.664166
Thor after his failed attempt to protect Asgard gets stranded on a strange planet where,0.13910012
he's captured by Valkyrie and forced to become a gladiatorial fighter against his friend and,0.1658017
fellow Avenger The Incredible Hulk before long though Thor assembles a team and the rest,0.08536306
of the film has spent watching the team or crew attempt to escape this strange,0.046088044
planet and take back Asgard from the Ebola alrightso thor ragnarok had a pretty interesting,0.24126944
marketing strategy in contrast to the previous two Thor films that were decently serious overall,0.054136615
the third installment was marketed as a more lighthearted silly and fun popcorn flick and,0.5562073
honestly that's exactly what this movie is Marvel's marketing efforts we're not misleading in the,0.09615796
slightest and overall I enjoyed thor ragnarok but I think the more the time passes,0.061933417
the more hollow I find the entire experience to be a lot of people are,0.16730751
claiming to this film sets a new standard for the MCU I really could not,0.066356845
disagree with that more this isn't one of Marvel's worse films but I wouldn't say,0.18481371
it's one of their best either I think it's somewhere in the middle of the,0.1016105
pack this is not a film that's ever going to bore you it moves at,0.18276714
a very quick pace and I found myself pretty entertained for the vast majority of,0.04396227
it there's some exceptional visuals some really nice comedy very solid performances across the board,0.10684626
but I gotta be honest I'm not overly fond of the goofy at all cost,0.45474717
approach that Marvel is currently taking with their films this is two films in a,0.09747659
row now and spider-man homecoming and Thor Ragnarok that I felt missed great opportunities to,0.096335076
be something much more than just a silly albeit entertaining superhero film the problem here,0.5580281
lies in the fact that Marvel seems fairly intent on making every film with the,0.18083672
same tone as guardians of the galaxy and there's not a tone that aligns naturally,0.15473972
with some other heroes in their stories Marvel was always injected bits of humor into,0.07115863
their films to add varying elements of lightheartedness to make the experience more family-friendly that's,0.07399318
totally fine I think the vast majority of people have always been fine with that,0.10167727
now it seems that Marvel is intent on taking the comedic route above all else,0.086842515
and I think that's gonna be something that's not gonna resonate with a large segment,0.08684977
of their fanbase Thor Ragnarok is a very entertaining movie that I very much enjoyed,0.09144745
watching but I feel like it's the kind of experience that won't resonate with viewers,0.08060702
in the way that Marvel films of the past have I think the primary reason,0.08220684
for that is that the film oftentimes refuses to take anything seriously most people probably,0.07366337
won't even realize this when they're watching it but I think when you leave the,0.09845468
theater and start thinking back on your experience you realize that it could have been,0.07057699
so much more if not for the tone that just seems off there's several very,0.09028417
funny moments but there's this inescapable feeling of emptiness I felt when reflecting back on,0.07631264
how little character development takes place over the course of this two-hour film I consider,0.14767116
that a huge missed opportunity because these characters have sort of become parodies of themselves,0.058545124
and that's kind of sad to me because I've become very attached and very invested,0.062442403
in these heroes and their stories that it kind of made me feel like I've,0.050849266
been betrayed a little bit by Marvel with how little they're progressing those characters Marvel,0.20141394
has always had a formula to their films but now the formula seems to have,0.067070894
shifted heavily in favor of comedy Thor Ragnarok a lot of times feels like a,0.10675507
comedy film with superheroes in it more than does a superhero film with some comedy,0.14666936
in it and that's probably something that's gonna resonate strongly with the family-friendly crowd but,0.05597515
I think will disappoint a lot of the more hardcore Marvel fans that are heavily,0.16216703
invested in these characters and their growth because there isn't much growth here for any,0.048527732
of the characters really like I said it's not like the movie isn't funny it,0.0651301
certainly is but there has to be a certain point where the filmmakers sort of,0.0727737
rein things in and refocus the audience with the serious issues at hand Ragnarok does,0.09197011
really well with its comedy but it doesn't do so hot with its drama and,0.2323547
it occasionally doesn't know when enough is enough and to put it serious face on,0.15458965
hell even guardians does that guardians struggles tones pretty effectively Thor Ragnarok doesn't really this,0.14491442
is starting to become like a vent session but I just feel like this direction,0.06679789
that Marvel was going feels like an over commercialization of their product and attempt to,0.05779312
be overly family-friendly above all else even telling a compelling and well-thought-out story some people,0.13427962
will love that for me I don't I miss the attempts at serious character development,0.13299023
but like I said there are definitely some things Thor Ragnarok does really really well,0.069108926
the visuals are outstanding and this is right up there with guardians from Marvel's most,0.05761225
vibrant movie yet the costumes the planets and the battle sequences they all look really,0.05582427
colorful and really great visually marvel hit another home run here it's a beautiful film,0.07801063
to look at performance wise I think everyone's really good Chris Hemsworth is good and,0.039415788
the row is always albeit a little more comedic this time around Tom Hiddleston returns,0.10813058
as a new more family-friendly albeit still mischievious low-key Mark Ruffalo is good as Bruce,0.15297455
Banner aka the hog but don't get your hopes up for development there's basically none,0.18591347
to be found for him Cate Blanchet is solid as hell if she's not a,0.31089434
great villain but she's certainly serviceable and Tessa Thompson is a nice addition to the,0.21461847
team as the strong-willed Bao Cree their performances are all pretty good I also really,0.09849103
enjoy the action there's a lot of style to be found in the battle scenes,0.08344844
that lends itself to the strong visual offerings Marvel has always been good with action,0.091267385
and they continue that trend here by delivering some really cool fight scenes they don't,0.097528346
quite rank near the top of the list but are still fun lively colorful and,0.038643833
exciting nonetheless but overall Thor Ragnarok is a fun experience but I really do believe,0.08085726
it's important that you go in expecting comedy and light-hearted superhero fun above all else,0.16674632
because that's what this movie is I thought it had solid performances across the board,0.09064614
some nice comedy vibrant and lively visual offerings and some strong action sadly also felt,0.056187864
the film didn't Joe tones well and felt overly silly and the character development was,0.38733044
lacking pretty heavily regardless i'm gonna give thor ragnarok an 8 out of 10 and,0.4492688
generally recommend you check this one out in theaters if you enjoy Marvel movies or,0.11528109
you're just looking for some fun in general make sure fun is your highest priority,0.0883727
though because that's what this movie offers first and foremost so did you guys see,0.05654002
Thor Ragnarok yet what did you think of it and if not let me know,0.12791432
why not and also let me know your favorite Thor film honestly I'm taking Thor,0.13432932
1 I think it has the best story and characters that's all for now though,0.029371152
