it will be necessary to do a spoiler talk video for Avengers endgame but this is not that video this is not that time this is a spoiler free review so peace of mind there that said if this comes across his vague if it comes across to me just being like well I like things and then there was a thing and but another thing was cool and that character was high I just try not to spoil it I said let's talk about this movie that's the culmination of the past eleven years of the MCU [Music] Avengers endgame so Avengers endgame is the sequel to Avengers infinity war yes Avengers endgame is in fact three hours long Avengers infinity Wars like two and a half or something like that so really it's one five and a half hour epic at the end of Avengers infinity war spoilers if you haven't seen it I imagine you have Thanos went snap and half of living beings disappeared so now this movie is them picking up the scraps if I would say life but really general existence that's a big hit everything took so now they got to lick their wounds help each other up take out Thanos if they can bring everyone back who disappeared if they can and that's really as much as I can say about it because that's what the trailer showed there's more going on in this movie there's always three hours long by the runtime you know it's not as simple as well gotta take that hose down I guess so the trailers were really vague it doesn't show really what's going on so I can't talk about what's really going on because if I talk about what's not in the trailer as people see it as a spoiler so we'll just talk about how I felt about the movie I really enjoyed the hell out of it I mean it'd be in three hours long there are slow parts slow parts those slow parts are character building parts I loved them all I was never bored in this movie for a three hour long movie to not bore me that's impressive it really does some great things with characters because where everyone's experiencing some form of pain or loss it's not like they're like ah humanity disappeared cool well let's go take down the grimace it's not that simple man this fall out there great character moments come from that like Hawkeye is more interesting in this movie that needs ever been in any MCU movie ever I mean it like I mean it I mean granted Hawkeye's character doesn't have a lot of competition when it comes to Hawkeye's character but no he was quite ravenous movie Captain America gets more shine that was one of my disappointments with Infinity Ward's like Captain America I felt like that kind of pushed to whose side I was like no that it's cap come on he became a favorite cap gets more time to shine in here I appreciated that I will say this isn't fan OSIS movie like infinity Wars Thanos this movie for sure this is not that this is the Avengers movie like Thanos had his movie he not punched all of them now it's them on the ground clutching their nuts good yeah that hurt didn't it okay let's let's see you try to get through that you're gonna punch back cool all right is your moment now cameras on you clutching your balls on the ground so if Thanos made infinity war for you'd like endgame isn't gonna give you that same feeling for that out I will say there are moments of conflicting information or at least one in particular where I'm like before you said now it works that's that's conflicting I don't know just things it's like Thor taking a dying star to the chest Lord can he really do that I guess he took it to the back it came whatever they used Captain Marvel really well - I know Captain Marvel's like a hot topic like a hot-button topic right now there's like some weird Captain Marvel economy online if you make videos about Captain Marvel apparently that's just good for YouTube videos I don't know why people care that much but I guess they do but they used Captain Marvel really well in this movie in fact in this movie I concede in this movie where I'm like oh you mean like she really is powerful like this movie made me like Captain Marvel more than Captain Marvel's movie made me like Captain Marvel but this is also directed by the Russos so I think her better director granted she's not in the movie much so again if you're looking for like oh yeah a Captain Marvel fest he's not really that so when her sparingly being in this movie when they did use her I really liked part of the plot that I actually can't talk about here because you know it's not in the trailer and by part of the plot I mean it's a big part of it it's familiar to another movie that I also can't mention here it's very familiar I walked out going it is like this movie you'll know when you see it when you watch the movie you'll be like that is like this other movie but as a whole it all worked out and the last act is really [ __ ] indescribable it's indescribable that's how I can describe it this is the MCU going yeah here it here it is it's come to a head this is 11 years built to this guys in the end that that's what I can say about this movie this movie is that this movie is the fanservice the payoff that the MCU is giving the fans that have been here for 11 years or if you haven't been here for 11 years if you got on the train at any point this movie it's here for you like granted yeah if you're looking for some highbrow masterpiece if you're all like yes it is a movie but does it film is it hot you might leave disappointed I mean it's [ __ ] art as far as I'm concerned but it's not like that it embraces what it is and it changes the game and it's almost when I was driving home I was just thinking to myself it's impossible to rate this movie as a movie in and of itself it's not a contained experience it's not just this one movie it's not just one movie it's chapter 22 of a saga and Odyssey a legacy like if you come into Avengers endgame you're select all right yeah I'm loosey-goosey with the MCU some of its alright I haven't seen all the movies I'm gonna check this out and see how it is you'll probably walk away going oh yeah I had fun with it but if you've been there for the MCU you love the MCU you know the heroes you know the villains you know the conflict you know the strife you know the love you love the characters you know the interactions you know the relationships if you feel connected to it in that capacity which I personally do this movie was straight-up made for you it's not literature like Lord of the Rings but in its own right it's pretty damn impactful I will say Avengers end game is awesome tacular alright spoiler-free i spoiler-free as i could make it because i had to talk about the damn movie like walking out of the movie the trailers are so VAT goes like I don't know what I could talk about oh I can just go that doesn't matter does it that's not the spoiler alright it's about this time I would say avengers endgame what do you think is gonna happen what do you think comment below let me know not going to do that this time because avengers endgame has been seen and there are people out there who know what happens in avengers endgame some of those people work to spoil the experience for people by giving spoilers so there are probably spoilers in the comments section right now don't even go down there if you want to help the video out give this video a thumbs up and then just [ __ ] bounce stay off the internet until you see Avengers end game I'm serious don't come back until you see it's been great I'll see you this week and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more [Music]
