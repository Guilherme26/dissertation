hey guys welcome back to my channel this is
Charlene i haven't record a movie review video for such a long time today i am going to do
a review on Lady Bird yes i watched this movie this afternoon it is a great movie telling
about how middle class family are going through it has been a while since a movie had moved
me emotionally i cried in the ending it is a really great movie for any family or any
one who had gone through high school and gone through conflicts with family i won't tell
about flaws today i just wanted to share you guys how this movie is. i really liked the pace of this movie, and
also the tone. the color hm cause ladybird has pink hair,
they used a lot of blue and pink colors inside the movie also a lot of sceneries landscapes
that i really love through out this movie i think everything is based on a simple script
the family are a middle class family and they are through day by day financial stresses
and lady bird in high school is through searching for love and you know meeting the wrong person
and noticed that her lover is gay and everything in the story is simple all the transitions
in the story is really simple but in a fact it feels so true and so realistic that i feel
i was in their world the soundtrack is comforting it has a really great ending so this movie
i really do recommend this movie is telling us to be grateful and to have a gratitude
of life i think the movie kind of taught me to just be who i am right now and know that
love is always there for me i think you guys will like it so thank you for clicking on
