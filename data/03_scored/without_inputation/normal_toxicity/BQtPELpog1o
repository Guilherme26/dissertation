this movie I was hyped because based on a few minutes that we got to,0.13109866
see a black panther in civil war a couple years ago it made me excited,0.36958832
for a character I didn't know much about and for me Black Panther is sort,0.21002959
of like the Batman of the Marvel Universe he has the coolest costume and the,0.08712452
coolest gadgets and speaking of Black Panthers costume in this film there's a lot of,0.050882425
upgrades and changes made to his costume where he essentially gets power upgrades and now,0.06207711
he's more indestructible than he ever was before and from a visual standpoint I understand,0.18533432
why they made some of the changes and tweaks to his costume aesthetically and from,0.14465839
a storytelling perspective I can understand why the powered up his suit essentially now he's,0.09797809
stronger than he was in previous movies because in future Marvel films you're going to,0.12723227
have black panther standing side by side with Thor and Hulk and he has to,0.10057601
look like he can carry his own so that made sense to me now let's,0.191841
talk about a little animated movie called The Lion King which came out in 1994,0.18078065
and this is a true story when I was a young kid when I watched,0.06604357
The Lion King I thought to myself if I try really hard in life one,0.2805078
day I'll grow up to become a lion because I I don't know why I,0.17380902
just wanted to fight hyenas I thought I could do that physically you have no,0.46381578
idea how letdown I was when I found that two years ago I couldn't and,0.104772225
this is nothing new or groundbreaking over the last couple of weeks many people have,0.07170047
compared the film black panther to The Lion King and I will just say this,0.097794674
if the writer a black panther was not heavily influenced by the story of The,0.039502386
Lion King well then it's the biggest quit Siddhant in film history that or he's,0.17065513
just lying because if someone told me to take the Lion King and turn it,0.31089434
into a comic book live-action movie it would turn out just like Black Panther let,0.22505574
me tell you something my father told me Simba everything the light touches is ours,0.17845613
you must never go there that's all I got now as far as the overall,0.26998436
look at the film black panther visually it's very impressive when you see the cityscapes,0.09844468
of Wakanda and African landscapes when I was watching the film I was genuinely interested,0.0762387
in this place Wakanda I wanted to learn more about it I wanted to see,0.08442236
the characters interacting in a social environment and how things look and how things interact,0.051444747
with each other and what makes this place so great and when you only get,0.08779205
three or four different locations that are all the essentially the same interior shots use,0.053810816
throughout the movie which is a lab where his sister develops the suits a little,0.09795591
place where they grow plants and then you have the throne room and outside of,0.106218785
that you really don't get much more and that's a little bit disappointing when you,0.3226451
see this huge amazing looking city you want to know more about it and I,0.08463432
thought the film could have established Wakanda as the character of its own throughout the,0.027564628
movie a little bit more so than it did now as far as chadwick boseman,0.15397926
who plays to chala aka Black Panther I understand that the character at times is,0.1027035
supposed to be stoic he is a leader he's very intelligent but I didn't really,0.20317487
feel like much charisma was coming from him as an actor throughout the film or,0.06021075
not enough to really make him stand out and get audiences rooting for him throughout,0.13877921
the movie I didn't really get that and with that said I think chadwick boseman,0.07695676
is a phenomenal actor the first movie I remember seeing him in was the movie,0.060908567
42 now real quick there's just one more thing I wanted to mention about Black,0.24061255
Panther in this film and that is if you watch the film Civil War when,0.054715242
you saw a Black Panther for the first time he was doing flips and kicking,0.5154597
ass and he seemed real competent and confident as the character Black Panther he knew,0.4110975
what he was doing it didn't feel like his first day on the job but,0.05160575
in the film black panther black panther himself doesn't seem like he's that great of,0.04655543
a fighter he kind of gets knocked down a lot and he almost needs to,0.20549284
be saved multiple times by his female bodyguards who also saved the day multiple times,0.19511385
now the character in this film that has the most depth and substance is the,0.053596865
character kill monger play by Michael B Jordan and I think they cast this character,0.6407051
perfectly because kill monger is he's a badass he has a motive that makes sense,0.62784386
and you understand it and even if you don't agree with it at least you,0.11070253
understand it the guy just wants to take what Condon's technology and give it to,0.08742118
everyone else because he thinks they're being selfish and when you watch the film you,0.40321097
almost agree with them at times but as far as Michael B Jordan as a,0.06699252
villain in this film I thought that's what really held this movie together and gave,0.15536185
it the depth and the substance that it needed and as the old saying goes,0.043127738
a hero is only as good as his villain and I think they got the,0.283724
villain right this time especially for a Marvel movie where the villains are typically just,0.13949913
big monster guys who want to do bad stuff for the sake of doing bad,0.73855066
stuff this time around you actually got a character and now I do have one,0.09344943
other negative with the film and that's some of the visuals and the fighting and,0.060755834
action sequences throughout the movie for example there's one fight scene that takes place on,0.0784942
a waterfall we see this group of people in the background cheering on and I,0.14900482
remember watching that scene in the theater and thinking those people in the background remind,0.114564046
me of the people in the background Street Fighter 2 yo and also throughout the,0.05261259
movie there's an overabundance of CG that makes the character of Black Panther when he's,0.17558436
fighting look like a video game cutscene at times Black Panther is directed by Ryan,0.24382542
Coogler who directed the film Creed you have this extended one take shot with no,0.2411915
cuts no edits and it's a phenomenal scene and I was hoping for something like,0.10504619
that in the film Black Panther because it seems like that that make movies stand,0.10939217
out in action sequences feel so real and you remember them for years to come,0.050119758
there isn't really one action sequence you're going to remember are you were on the,0.054478027
edge of your seat watching their all-sufficient they're entertaining at times to watch but I,0.14393838
really was expecting more now here are my final flicking thoughts on the film black,0.2407435
panther overall this is a fun comic book movie that is entertaining at times and,0.123553
the best thing about this movie is it's a comic book movie that has a,0.12546685
moral message to tell people and it's you should help people just because you have,0.10280969
something doesn't mean you should keep it for yourself give it to people help them,0.06126049
out and that's a good message that's positive two thumbs up for that but I,0.07855602
would be lying if I said this film didn't have some pacing issues and it,0.14157836
could have been better than it was especially with the action and the way that,0.053697504
it was filmed I really expected a little bit more out of this movie just,0.11473736
based on the character and how awesome you could make a black panther film just,0.019773288
take the character of Black Panther put him in this situation show his movesets and,0.07447512
his skills and how he can do flips and just take those calls and just,0.14954358
ah overall this is a competent movie I think it's a good first solo movie,0.1347642
for Black Panther is it as great as it could have been probably not and,0.29328558
I will just say this 10 years ago who would have ever thought we would,0.104826994
be seeing a solo Black Panther film like it's crazy we live in great times,0.23344694
right now I'm going to give the film Black Panther Oh a b-minus go check,0.11399671
the movie out it's a good time it's entertaining and it's a solid Marvel movie,0.09997965
with a great villain that doesn't happen very often in Marvel movies so that's my,0.18854067
