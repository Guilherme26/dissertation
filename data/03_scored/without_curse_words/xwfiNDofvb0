just gonna roll the dice on this what do you say pal yo this is,0.10825837
so tough i i just told you that list listen i'm from the future how,0.08248234
dare you point at me you you were pointing they doing a boy first let,0.23459819
me start by saying don't forget to like comment and subscribe if you are subscribed,0.07840972
hit the notification this was better than i ever expected i mean they took a,0.26239812
bunch of care and detail they placed into this movie i mean so let's start,0.1361153
at the beginning right so when we first see miles and his family i'm like,0.04350764
oh yeah that's a black dad yeah that's hispanic mama yeah that's new york like,0.65811616
the the ambiance and everything as the father's driving him you just hear some spanish,0.12113356
music in the background it's hustle and bustle you see this new gentrifying ass shop,0.76855314
um what was it like phone party or some like that like you just see,0.15027821
all this dopeness but they wasn't putting a bunch on it right it just seemed,0.16639173
natural and towards the end of this film at no point this is what was,0.06948234
dope about it at no point did i even take into account yo he's black,0.73058367
and he's hispanic until it got to the end and i went this is some,0.17759907
of the best representation modern representation i've ever seen portrayed just period and for it,0.047747176
to be in a cgi ass cartoon ass marvel movie is like yo there was,0.8060606
no patronizing at no point did i even consider what kelly was and who he,0.06969923
is plays a place in the film it's not just there just randomly right even,0.062039778
gwen her being a spider spider woman or whatever it may it made sense right,0.27314326
this was dope in the beginning he's talking to people he talking to his boys,0.3949024
and as he walking down the block and you like yo that's what somebody would,0.28566495
say like so from then on at no other point was i going oh that's,0.08561672
what they say now i'm fully involved into it now i'm in this world and,0.075003274
it seems real and he speaks how a young black kid would speak from new,0.5931298
york his pops and his uncle like his uncle seemed like a uncle down now,0.37974626
how he was dressed down to how he acted like down to how his house,0.15184526
look he looked like a bachelor ass uncle right man this was so dope the,0.89513314
way his mom she would speak spanish randomly to him and like man it was,0.18162118
dope then he goes to uh he goes to a tech uh high school or,0.41460508
whatever and it's like that's dope like some of the most famous new yorkers that,0.20821916
that we see nowadays they've gone to schools like that where it's like this multicultural,0.11491928
uh place and it's like it's asians blacks white people and they all together and,0.5519428
that these parents send their kids there and it literally sets them off on a,0.066636726
dope path right so his mom is a nurse his pops is a uh i,0.6596092
think she's a nurse she could be a doctor the the pops is a cop,0.11550428
and they they strive to like get him into a better place and the pops,0.09104255
told him like hey man you the choices everybody has choices and he's like well,0.08808522
what if i choose not to go he's like no no you got to go,0.16301
right that's how it is it's like he he wants him to do better and,0.10054566
be better and i just thought from the beginning from the very start of this,0.0604373
it laid the groundwork of who miles morales is what his family is what he,0.14890888
came from let's get into this artwork yo the colors mixing the comic aspect into,0.11449796
it and doing it in such a dope way it didn't sacrifice anything by doing,0.1851893
it when onomatopoeia was involved when thought bubbles were involved where um the coloring would,0.08934661
change based off of the fight sequences it all made sense and it wasn't there,0.054677676
was no sacrifice in doing that um the physics oh right so they could have,0.084152944
just gone away and played it straight let's keep this as real as possible but,0.26216513
based on what this was and what they were trying to convey the physics was,0.0784816
just fire er i maybe in the next film and i it based off that,0.15443254
the ending it seems there's gonna be a next film they're gonna go even more,0.0663444
big but uh until we got to that last part a lot of the fighting,0.08937872
was it seemed very closed in which was dope right because like it wasn't this,0.14940326
spread out thing even when they're running from doc ock and they're going through the,0.14924407
forest it wasn't this wide open area right or even when they were fighting against,0.086564064
her inside the building it's this closed-in sort of fight and i was like and,0.4622367
then one of the dopest scenes of the past however many years for me as,0.33587733
far as action goes is uh when prowler and uh the scorpion and the other,0.06881567
dude they're inside aunt may's house and they're fighting and they told him hey can,0.10204237
y'all take this outside you're gonna my house up and they tear the house up,0.14553851
but the fighting it was so dope i mean in this close little area so,0.15705931
much was going on it was like i would have to watch it multiple times,0.092610046
to catch everything that was taking place because it was all happening at once like,0.081371225
some they're like this is an aspect of like oh like some of these classic,0.18722081
kung fu films where they're able to do things at one time that it it,0.17730893
just it plays with your brain right but you can see the things that they,0.42611307
want you to pay attention to you pay attention to so well while he has,0.11040656
the goober and he's trying to escape whatever power's chasing him there's still going off,0.24095103
on the side and then every once in a while something would come in and,0.117985316
uh like spider girl spider woman whatever she comes she snatches the goober in it,0.49253413
all that was dope the story line with his uncle that was dope i don't,0.24728729
know how in my i don't know why i couldn't figure out who the prowler,0.13110548
was and when uh when he started talking i'm like wait he has a black,0.46239543
voice i still didn't get who the the problem was but yeah man i still,0.07888171
didn't get who the problem was this was so good um i should have been,0.06122447
able to pick that up though even down to the spider that bit him the,0.14826503
colors on it were like it was very colorful but it wasn't too bright i,0.18886794
can't really explain that this wasn't a very bright move film but the it had,0.06693648
so many vivid colors that it was like oh did they they did it they,0.048806354
did it right because this could have been a shock to the system if it's,0.062411256
too bright get like because it looks like a kaleidoscope when he's doing this little,0.16305685
inter-dimensional breakdown or whatever it was done perfect um the voice acting this some dope,0.47956255
ass voice acting every and everything they were saying it sounded so real and so,0.735928
sincere and i really appreciated that even down to like how gwen was talking to,0.15307657
him uh uh peter b parker everything uh aunt may i liked that i enjoyed,0.40316015
this aunt may man it was and it was a bunch of things that was,0.090154424
dope to see right so i've been out of comics for a while but it,0.1969085
was dope to see all the spider suits in the basement or whatever in the,0.18158935
little layer or whatever um and then let's get to the dopest part of the,0.41634068
film all the different spider-man we got gwen we got peter porker peter b parker,0.2514754
spider-man noir which was fire i i want to see them do like little mini,0.32307073
like let's say the next film comes out let's do like some little mini uh,0.10353684
shows or whatever that like make it a mini series and each episode is uh,0.073096104
like some little issue that they're dealing with and it all leads up to this,0.06502173
to that to that film that would be so fire because i'm interested i'm even,0.2661971
interested in peter porker i i found that amusing that when i first saw him,0.2701086
i go yo is this even legal like that's clearly a rip-off of of porky,0.52940315
pig and like he has these like acme tools he has a a mallet he,0.76905066
has the um anvil and it's like for them to acknowledge that at the end,0.16513443
that was fire um man storyline was just dope man like i i had no,0.3516655
problems with it right i'm not expecting nothing too crazy but for as far as,0.43316135
the origin story fire and based off what they showed at the ending with uh,0.10057936
uh that uh other spider-man going to earth 67 yo we in for some fly,0.15720245
right man this is for me for me this is my favorite off the first,0.09607293
watch my favorite cgi thing i've seen i don't really enjoy those type of movies,0.115718454
right like i was even thinking to myself am i going to watch seoul when,0.08237163
it comes out this month i'm probably going to end up watching that but that's,0.12431115
probably a little played into a little bit why i didn't watch this until so,0.12699245
much so much further but man this was good this was good um i want,0.11468438
to know how they're going to take this though because this is so um cool,0.08502559
and they could have made it cool how can i put this to the point,0.06898209
where it was cheesy but they understood what people would want to see so to,0.09872591
see peter parker peter b parker see mj again and be like you know awestruck,0.13408877
or whatever you're like oh that was you know what i mean or to see,0.14996046
like for for me right i don't read the comments i don't know if this,0.12687004
is this way in this comics to see doc och reveal this doc ock it,0.17674938
never even crossed my mind that she was doc i'm like oh that's tough right,0.18775862
because my whole life has been some old white guy with the glasses and only,0.48687902
thing they changed was her sex it's an old white chick with glasses man dope,0.7728963
they they knew what they were doing on this the people who worked on this,0.08954358
understood the material and you could tell and they loved it and with it and,0.08289504
they understood what they were trying to convey and i got it this was fire,0.13506454
hey this actually makes me want to start watching some more like comic uh like,0.18605992
bass movies and like the uh rise of the superman i plan on watching that,0.15203069
maybe um they uh the and the x-men anime with the wolverine anime that's coming,0.116008185
on netflix soon i haven't watched that so i may end up watching that too,0.15309091
