a few weeks ago I had the pleasure of seeing one of my most anticipated,0.06590877
films of the year ladybird ladybird is a film about a high school girl named,0.113388166
ladybird played by Saoirse Ronan and about her relationship with her mother played by Laurie,0.34967443
Metcalf and how it's affected when ladybird meets boys when she's moving after college and,0.15348366
a bunch of other small things I'm gonna cut to the chase and say that,0.28446442
I really really liked this movie it's really rare to see a dramedy that balances,0.14201842
comedy and drama so flawlessly this movie blends the two together in an almost invisible,0.11372182
way the movie is hilarious and sad but not a depressing way it's more of,0.13942878
a it gets you to understand the emotions that the characters are getting across while,0.05721689
at the same time making you laugh again the humor is super clever and very,0.15223391
consistent usually in comedies it'll be really funny and then it'll get really dramatic and,0.070802614
then it'll go back to being funny and it would be some really good parts,0.24420686
and some really bad parts but this movie is hilarious all the way through I,0.16768128
don't want to spoil anything but there are some extremely clever and unpredictable cuts throughout,0.11645299
this thing that are super sad but also hilarious which is kind of confusing at,0.10931518
times but it ends up working really well it's super interesting because throughout the film,0.049605895
I'm trying to figure out if I'm just a jerk for laughing at certain things,0.77566403
or if it's actually supposed to be that funny as for the drama it works,0.079995565
insanely well the film does a great job at making you actually feel for these,0.08735764
characters and not like they're just people on a screen it makes you feel like,0.09916766
you're in that world and that these people have feelings and it's that aspect of,0.15305011
the film that makes it super convincing as for the actual plot it's actually a,0.05689372
pretty cliche idea it's really just about a girl that's going off to college and,0.1576637
sort of her relationship with her mother and swear the troubles that come with that,0.24154985
but it's done in such an interesting and unique way that honestly I've never seen,0.07093161
before I almost got a bit of a Napoleon Dynamite vibe coming from it because,0.1167583
it's able to get this high school story across in a very interesting and non,0.10687373
cliche way I mean it was able to take a scene where one student gets,0.106460266
an A and the other gets a C and it made it convincing for once,0.15184894
usually those scenes I'm just kind of like yeah okay but this one I actually,0.080205135
felt for the characters I owe a lot of this to Greta Gerwig the director,0.06530811
who by the way is very at her job considering this is her directorial debut,0.09472814
and she did a pretty much perfect job I mean throughout the entire film the,0.1184195
direction is on point I mean there's not a single flaw with what she did,0.15678848
the whole thing is super exciting and fresh there's an adult and for the acting,0.08742878
I mean Saoirse Ronan Laurie McAfee locust hedges the whole cast did a really fantastic,0.18433805
job probably one of my highlights is Laurie McCaffrey gave a phenomenal performance as the,0.08467759
mother I mean every time she was on the screen I was completely drawn into,0.10018967
the film and on top of that I want to give a shout out to,0.09489355
beanie Feldstein I've never heard of her prior to this I looked her up and,0.22472134
she really hasn't had that much experience before this film and she was by far,0.10436256
the funniest part of the movie I felt like I connected to her and I,0.08839604
thought that she was hilarious I mean it was she was just a great character,0.085464664
overall in reality every character felt so much like they belong in this world each,0.1091885
one felt so important and vital to the story which is so rare like I,0.08143469
said earlier to a film about high school that is also a dramedy I mean,0.17083046
it all just felt really natural in terms of cinematography this film is just beautiful,0.09752486
there's nothing incredibly striking or out-of-this-world about it but it works really well with the,0.09512708
story and doesn't make you feel you know distracted or like it's anything more than,0.0620414
what it is the whole aesthetic of the film is just very pleasing it's very,0.09178888
dark red kind of golden I don't know despite all of what I've said I,0.17391145
do understand that there are probably going to be some people that don't like this,0.09784315
movie for one their major plot points in this film that are addressed within the,0.064234175
matter of seconds now that's usually done for the sake of humor and it actually,0.055359494
works very well but I can see why some people might not like that very,0.13379405
much I know a lot of people like a big buildup in a super dramatic,0.3293649
climax but this film isn't like that if anything this film makes fun of dramatic,0.15679827
movies well at the same time being a dramatic film very well on top of,0.12925097
that there are a few parts of the film that don't come full circle necessarily,0.06378765
if you want to avoid spoilers I suggest skipping to this part of the video,0.13461593
I mean for one near the end of the film we figure out that lady's,0.121095054
father is depressed we figure out that the drama teacher is seeking help and there's,0.08955721
a scene where lady's father runs into her brother while applying for the same job,0.21535161
I mean for that last one I don't think necessarily needed an end it kind,0.09634788
of spoke for itself but for the others it would have been nice to learn,0.09202036
a little bit more about these characters and where this would have gone but again,0.08834935
as is I thought that the film worked incredibly well without it I thought I'd,0.020740533
kind of fit with the overall story that you know it's life is kind of,0.09889501
unpredictable and there are loose ends and you don't know what's gonna happen next and,0.16200013
you know it's it works besides that this film is absolutely amazing it's stunning the,0.09921747
writing is great it's hilarious it's sad it's basically everything you would want in a,0.11237135
dramedy to be honest it might be my favorite film of the year if not,0.06809165

aspects of this process that I haven't seen done in any other films about this,0.082209505
and it does so in a really enjoyable and unique way I cannot recommend this,0.095148586
