I did so book smart um it is a film about so you've got Molly,0.15355942
and Amy and they're the two main characters and they are very studious they're very,0.05473534
serious young women and the film starts on the second last day of school so,0.11702662
technically it's the last day of high school and the following day is gonna be,0.045881785
graduation and everybody's gonna be going off to you know their respective lives colleges universities,0.104960024
whatever they're gonna be doing after school and Molly and Amy have spent all of,0.027418423
their school career you know studying hard be very serious about it not being distracted,0.10244741
by parties by anything that was going on that other people were getting up to,0.10798335
because they wanted to get the best grades and they wanted to get into the,0.05401024
best universities and kind of set themselves up for you know their adult life which,0.064691454
is really cool and they're very happy with this they're their best friends they have,0.04223404
a really kind of sweet friendship they kind of do everything together and they've been,0.07394256
very happy with this and in fact I would say Molly um kind of Lords,0.11599243
a little bit over other people and she she's off you know I think it's,0.202632
Yale that she's off to and she kind of just she's very kind of proud,0.24133128
as you should be for getting into a good university and you know she kind,0.28781775
of looks down a little bit on some of her so-called like slacker or party,0.4861565
kids in the school and this is all fine and dandy until on the last,0.13234866
day uh they kind of make a shocking discovery so they discover that in spite,0.153237
of the fact that some of their classmates have had a great time they've partied,0.061183814
they've done what they want they've also gotten good grades and gotten into good universities,0.05859552
and this is just a shock and a revelation to them Molly and Amy particularly,0.08699601
Molly and they decide that what they're gonna do is gonna have one night and,0.06175394
they are going to kind of make up this four years of where they've not,0.06790452
gone to parties they've not had this sort of kind of teen high school experience,0.13121152
they're gonna make it up in one night and they're gonna go into the coolest,0.05358782
party and they're just gonna you know be teenagers for one night now kind of,0.08513562
as you can imagine hilarity ensues on this night because nothing really goes to plan,0.15285043
and it is a it is a very funny film I laughed out loud and,0.09149045
there were people in the in the theater with me just laughing out loud at,0.11081669
lots of points some of them are hilarious it's they're very kind of it's very,0.15215866
high and I love kind of teen I'm gonna put my hands up I love,0.14944212
kind of teen American high school films anyway but this one is very funny what,0.10433024
I love about this one as well is that the main character Molly she isn't,0.095540136
your stick-thin model type and then Amy she is a lesbian she's out she's proud,0.82657945
she's been out for two years she's trying to find a girlfriend um and the,0.14344735
block does not hinge on coming out either and then you've got you've got some,0.15308475
great queer up in this book so you've got Amy and then you've got Amy's,0.2455368
kind of love interest then you've got two side characters they're gay guys they're fabulous,0.46729457
they're kind of theatre and they're interested of doing these theater performances very flamboyant dresses,0.14288597
so there's some really great queer rep as well the parents are hilarious Lisa Kudrow,0.25068903
as Amy's mother is hysterical it's like a really small cameo but it's very funny,0.34295794
and I just kind of I loved the film I just thought it was fun,0.06606722
it was sweeted at heart to it it just it was it kind of talks,0.16392943
about friendship and first love and there's just so many wonderful wonderful elements of it,0.0820239
and I highly recommend it the other thing I love about this film is that,0.074838094
you've got two female leads which is fantastic and most of the storyline focuses on,0.15328789
female characters as well as well as the director so I'm trying to make a,0.103518136
conscious effort to not only watch films that have queer representation but also films that,0.0064741503
have female directors because unbelievably um it's not good Hollywood you still have to actually,0.32926607
look for films and this is this is slightly more of an indie film and,0.07514016
Olivia Wilde is the director she doesn't awesome job I think she's really created a,0.27896148
gorgeous kind of I think like a cult classic teen film that I love and,0.09747618
it honestly is and the reason why I'm actually sitting down and talking about it,0.15018976
is because it's it's my favorite film that I've possibly seen all year on in,0.052357674
a very long time really really really enjoyed it loved this film and I would,0.09664967
say so as if you like this you might like that if you like book-smart,0.32524297
watch it please if you do and you like it you might enjoy it slightly,0.18058768
older film crumbled 83 and I probably do a separate video batch of cat3 because,0.15188132
it's one of my all-time favorite films but you know look it up online it's,0.087568715
kind of got that same vibe that friendship that finding your way there's a queer,0.53490317
element and that as well so yeah I definitely think if you enjoyed book smart,0.23998949
you'll enjoy gypsy 83 so kind of those are my thoughts so what I'm gonna,0.1698392
do with my film reviews is I'm gonna give you three of my favorite things,0.06472199
about the film and then I'm just gonna tell you what the film makes me,0.053429443
feel so my three favorite films about the favorite things about this film is that,0.06375773
it was directed by a woman you've got an out-and-proud lesbian main character and the,0.31089434
story's not about coming out or her being a lesbian she just is and then,0.6499733
you've got a very strong female lead cast and a beautiful friendship and very positive,0.19127484
female friendships kind of Pro women um which is awesome to see and then for,0.19573316
me this film kind of looks like a it's kind of a Mardi Gras meets,0.38795727
clueless and this beautiful cinematography the colors are lovely and then the outfits and some,0.16001584
of the clothes are just really cool and quirky and fun then it kind of,0.07690082
it tastes like uh I would say it kind of tastes like an ice cream,0.17323051
sundae but one that you've put all the toppings on just fun and ever Vicent,0.15052138
and gorgeous and it feels like summer like sunshine and just like proper high school,0.07755014
