"I know this is supposed to be a kids movie, but this movie really touched my soul"
"Okay, I feel like I would sit in that hour and 50 minutes therapy session That"
I just need it because they got my wife all the way together
"By the end, everyone is running from pair of weights, and today I'm going to be reviewing Disney and Pixar Coco"
"I'm so, was directed by Lee after she was responsible for a directing Toy Story 3 and Adrianne Molina is a co-director who is responsible for writing The Good Dinosaur"
"So Coco centers around Miguel, who is a young boy who was an aspiring musician That just so happens to be born into a shoemaking family that absolutely hates music"
They hate music so much
"Even saying that music is the reason that their family was cursed many many years ago, So the movie basically shows Miguel kind of fighting with his family, especially his Abuelita, who is really really against music in the family, and he tries so hard to try to expire to his music goals, despite being told no time after time again that somehow he ends up in the land of the dead, and in order to leave, he has to receive his family's blessing"
The only problem is he wants to receive one of his family's blessings that actually wants him to do music
So he seeks goes on a journey to find her next
"Oh de la Cruz, who he believes to be a long-lost relative on one of his ancestors"
I'm so rude
"Then on the movie details his journey, finding our nurse toenail crews, and then also Miguel, learning more about his family and his ancestors and how music played a role into their family in the past"
so let's talk about what I enjoyed about the movie
"So let's go ahead and get this out of the way, because you already knew this was coming"
The the animation is stunning
I mean this Pixar
"I mean, everyone pretty much knew that this movie was going to be stunning, but it's absolutely gorgeous with the use of colors when they lay out what the the Land of the Dead looks like, and is absolutely amazing from the different characters to the skeletons, Even the little characteristics that they gave to everyone to make them look different"
"The spirit animals, everything is just absolutely gorgeous"
"Um, So for me, like I said in the beginning of this video, I got so much life from this movie"
I felt so inspired
"Actually, I was so inspired at the end of this movie that I actually already went and did my 2018 Vision board That all my goals together, got my life together"
"If it was just really great, I can see my family like I understand"
"A lot of people had an issue with why they're releasing this film during Thanksgiving week, instead of closer to the first week of November, which is closer to November 1st"
The day is dead
"But after watching the movie and seeing their really theme of family, and being thankful for what those before you have done, and making sure that we understand where we come from, I really think it makes sense now why they're releasing the story Thanksgiving, Which, what most people will be around their family"
Who this is when everyone pretty much goes to the movies together as a family
"So it makes sense to me, The other like theme There really got me together was like the theme of my perseverance"
"Like seizing the moment was like a really big deal in this movie And watching Miguel, even though he was a young boy, like he wanted to be a musician, he knew that that's what he was destined to do, and no matter who told him no, he was going to do what he needed to do to follow history, not even just follow his dreams, Bull run after his dreams, So I really thought that was absolutely amazing"
That's why I really feel like
"Even though these are great things for children to see, I think it's a great thing for adults to see to, kind of you know, rejuvenate everybody's spirits, because I just I love this movie"
"The movie was funny like there is definitely like funny parts that even the kids caught on to some of the jokes that the adults were laughing at, and also to the music"
I'm a sucker for a musical
"and like all the songs, especially with a Dylan closer to the Mexican culture, I really enjoy all of the songs, especially the main song"
Raymond
"member me, I'm nice singer, But that was my song right"
That was my song
"but overall, I think this is a great movement family, great for the kids and hell, all the kids attention In the movie theater"
"There was no one like getting restless or running around crazy, since it is an hour and fifty minute movie, which is a little bit longer than most children's films, So for me, I would definitely say that you need to pay to go see this movie in theaters"
It's a great ride
It's a great new addition to Disney
I love the cultural diversity that Disney and Pixar is introducing into their collection of films and I can't wait to see what they do next
