Martis filmmaking career is now in its sixth decade and in all that time he's,0.034287557
directed 25 narrative features in 16 feature documentaries and of those 41 movies maybe six,0.018937113
or seven could be called crime dramas and yet for better for worse many people,0.12737203
who have only a passing knowledge of Scorsese's movies likely associate him with crime dramas,0.059793357
and gangster fare so if you're one of those people who dismissed the Irishman out,0.13977571
of hand as just another Scorsese gangster movie stop it it's not so much that,0.15904209
Scorsese only makes gangster movies or even mostly makes gangster movies it's more that the,0.10054783
ones that he has made have pretty much defined the genre I mean you know,0.054815125
any list of the best gangster movies ever made is gonna be like half scorsese,0.13551787
for that reason chastising haters aside I guess it's only appropriate that his opus about,0.056762114
looking back on your life and everything you've ever done would take the shape of,0.15586916
an expansive gangster crime epic the 77 year old directors latest begins in a nursing,0.22808434
home with octogenarian Frank Sheeran played by Robert DeNiro directly addressing the camera in this,0.017534906
confessional style he recalls a fateful road trip he took a quarter century earlier from,0.036313705
Philadelphia to Detroit with aged my boss and longtime friend Russell Bufalino played by Joe,0.033250533
Pesci early in this road trip flashback the movie flashes back a second time -,0.05793683
Frank's time as a truck driver for a meatpacking company in his 30s when he,0.088943034
first meets Russell and becomes a Lackey for the Bufalino crime family the story moves,0.10646996
forward from there chronicling Frank's rise from Bufalino Lackey to Bufalino hitmen while it occasionally,0.16398506
returns to old Frank on the road trip and really old Frank addressing the camera,0.036428116
in the nursing home eventually the main storyline catches up to this fateful road trip,0.026306018
and it becomes clear why Frank's life story confessional begins with and occasionally returns to,0.014467079
this road trip as it ends up being the most consequential trip of his life,0.054940842
after Frank proves himself capable of painting houses which is a blood splatter related euphemism,0.2001298
for performing hits Russell introduces him to union leader Jimmy Hoffa played by Al Pacino,0.039191954
and Frank transitions from being a crony for the in the shadows crime boss to,0.06383634
being a company for the high-profile union leader and this is how old Frank's narration,0.01950784
introduces Jimmy Hoffa nowadays young people they don't know Jimmy Hoffa was they don't have,0.029313978
a clue I mean maybe they they know that he disappeared or something but that's,0.052173678
about it but back then there was a nobody in this country who didn't know,0.06119224
who Jimmy Hoffa was and astute and helpful observation as this young person only knew,0.030593127
that Hoffa disappeared and that's about it turns out as Frank's narration continues in the,0.018484788
fifties he was as big as Elvis in the sixties he was like the Beatles,0.057529073
next to the president he was like the most powerful man in the country bar,0.020942641
none I had no idea before this movie but Hoffa captured the respect and admiration,0.021541307
of millions of Americans including and especially Frank's daughter Peggy played by Lucy Galina as,0.030612417
a child and Anna Paquin as an adult in these early years young Peggy's admiration,0.035111055
for Hoffa is in direct contrast with her disdain for Russell and her indifference towards,0.072414555
Frank she sees her father's violent ways first hand and she deduces the nature of,0.094887115
his work for Russell where are you going go to work in the later years,0.023589408
Peggy's indifference towards her father turns to disdain as she suspects that he was involved,0.16223231
in Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance much has been written about Anna Paquin's lack of lines but,0.022773227
her silence is the whole point she's silently judging Frank and she's the audience stand-in,0.05603507
by doing so the whole point of old Frank in the nursing home telling his,0.024795385
story directly to camera is that he's trying to explain himself attempting to justify the,0.028324185
choices that he made that ultimately made his daughter hate him I know what wasn't,0.10281478
done good dad I know that I know that I was just trying to protect,0.012741593
all this from what this framing device makes the movie a confessional it's not a,0.03214633
spoiler to say that it ends with Frank talking to a priest and given the,0.025294274
final shot of the movie it stands to reason that whoever Frank is addressing as,0.10234183
he looks directly the camera is also intended to be a priest or perhaps God,0.021301841
himself or herself this comes out in the language of his narration how he's embarrassed,0.08206304
by parts of his own story when he talks about when he left his first,0.030762749
wife for his second wife he's like ashamed of himself eventually Frank comes to a,0.11502888
crossroads where he must decide between Russell Bufalino and Jimmy Hoffa and maybe it's not,0.038300607
even much of a choice one of the interesting through lines of the movie is,0.015583257
it's meditation on power young Peggy rebukes Russell and is taken by Jimmy because Russell's,0.016402097
clearly a criminal and Jimmy at least appears to be clean Jimmy doesn't get his,0.14107148
hands dirty so Peggy admires him because she assumes he isn't dirty but his hands,0.32754877
aren't dirty only because he makes Frank do his bidding Frank is powerful in the,0.09150533
sense that he can perform hits and beat the out of people but the real,0.26826876
power is not with Frank but with whoever's holding the reins in Jimmy Hoffa has,0.011308787
the power to control not only Frank but also billions of dollars of Union money,0.019492542
one of several fascinating historical subplots involves how hafez Union money investments built Las Vegas,0.024117563
what it is today in doing so Hoffa commands the respect of Frank's daughter that,0.034344763
eludes Frank his whole life there's plenty of clear overlap with Goodfellas you know both,0.039878424
are about one man's decades-long involvement in organized crime and like Henry Hill and Goodfellas,0.046087913
Frank Sheeran is a passive character in an early scene Frank tells Russel about his,0.022342853
time in Italy in World War two you got all this you followed up if,0.29893062
they tell you to bring some prisoners into the woods you know and they don't,0.05287013
they don't tell you what to do but they just say yo hurry up Russell,0.03295187
Bufalino works the same way he tells you to do something and you take care,0.15744165
of it however you take care of it and when you did something for us,0.023279432
you did it yourself like Russ used to say when I asked somebody to take,0.110695206
care of something for me I expect them to take care of it themselves I,0.06829374
don't need to rule to come back after Frank's time as a soldier in Italy,0.091080934
he's then a soldier for the Bufalino family and then he's a soldier for Jimmy,0.033192664
Hoffa but he never has any power of his own or any control over the,0.025293607
events around him he's a cog in a machine powerless to prevent the death of,0.1379338
his friend another clear overlap with Goodfellas is obviously the presence of Robert De Niro,0.028070085
and Joe Pesci and De Niro's giving the best performance he's given in like a,0.042190604
decade understated but still conflicted and by the end pained and as impossible as it,0.03491283
may seem this is actually the first collaboration between Al Pacino and Scorsese and you,0.033258516
know Pacino has kind of been in ostentatious shouty mode for the last thirty years,0.035526127
she got off great ass but shaadi mode works well and he's playing an ostentatious,0.6646778
overconfident Union boss but the real revelation of the movie is Joe Pesci emerging out,0.06368202
of semi-retirement to deliver one final devastating performance for the director that made his career,0.030305767
in the 80s and 90s do not expect the fiery short-fused firecracker that he played,0.10471986
in Goodfellas and Casino or even in my cousin Vinnie and home alone here Pesci,0.085412905
never even raises his voice and yet he still as menacing and terrifying as comedy,0.0923807
Vito and Goodfellas in one key scene Frank Sheeran finds himself explaining questionable actions to,0.017669274
mob boss Angelo Bufalino and a brief appearance from Harvey Keitel and Pesci's Russell Bufalino,0.06771836
doesn't even have to say a word in the entire scene and yet he's as,0.048536453
captivating and tension inducing with silent looks as he is in the why am i,0.07621608
funny seen the digital d aging of the characters was like the big hook talking,0.028436601
point of this movie and you know it ballooned the budget north of 150 million,0.042865764
hence why Netflix got involved and I thought it worked fine for the most part,0.02008256
like the first cut from 55 year old Frank's face to 35 year old Frank's,0.11760114
face is like a little jarring but I got used to it on the Directors,0.10330036
Guild of America director's cut podcast Scorsese said that he sees the digital D aging,0.0563364
is just the next evolution of film makeup you know you have to factor in,0.019641543
how it effects lighting and camera angles but you have to do that with makeup,0.043036718
too admittedly the digital D aging is for now limited to faces and there's always,0.033985563
so much that can be done to make a 75 year old body look like,0.046608087
a 35 year old it's what it is so why age down older actors why,0.06262438
not cast younger actors the younger scenes and then use traditional makeup to age them,0.08278144
up for the older scenes which is what would have been done in the first,0.014789693
hundred years of moviemaking and the answer simple that would change the movie down to,0.016875044
its bones the Irishman is about an old man looking back at his life whether,0.115722
that old man is Frank Sheeran or Robert De Niro or Martin Scorsese take your,0.08040141
pick a younger man playing Frank Sheeran would lose this pathos more important than the,0.072189055
overlap with Goodfellas are the differences where Goodfellas is a frenetic hyper stylized roller coaster,0.07592938
Scorsese said at the time that he wanted the movie to feel like an amusement,0.050663713
park ride the Irishman is a patient slow-burn with a 200 minute runtime to prove,0.13738304
it the framing device of that opening road trip from Philadelphia to Detroit is a,0.03255675
decent metaphor for the movies leisurely sprawl Frank and Russel could fly but they opt,0.019880343
to drive and take their time and take care of some business along the way,0.040831633
and reminisce about when they were younger men and they are certainly no longer younger,0.09323214
men where Goodfellas followed Henry Hill from adolescence to middle-age the Irishman follows its characters,0.052911367
from middle age to the grave when secondary and tertiary characters are introduced there's a,0.035447635
freeze frame in text that displays their name and the date and manner of their,0.03322193
death underlining that this movie is above all about endings as I mentioned Scorsese is,0.24435747
now 77 years old De Niro's seventy-six Pesci's 76 Pacino is 79 yeah these guys,0.044435598
might continue to make movies for another 10 years you know Clint Eastwood's 89 after,0.038524777
all but it's hard to not consider this movie something of a swan song especially,0.050287217
given the nature of the story chronicling the lives of these men from their thirties,0.18140689
to their 80s it all has the air of we've been at this all our,0.027340379
lives and we've had a good run but now it's over earlier this year director,0.042716097
Todd Phillips used the term Trojan horsing to describe his attempt to hide a psychological,0.07839588
character trauma inside a superhero movie an argument to be made that Scorsese and screenwriter,0.051517144
Steve Zaillian used a gangster movie Trojan horse to deliver a movie about getting old,0.22599979
and out living everyone you ever knew and having nothing about time on your hands,0.18847181
to look back on your life as you sit around and wait for death far,0.51111186
too many cultural critics over the years have made the mistake of acquainting the actions,0.031360082
and morals of Scorsese's characters with Scorsese himself and yet it's hard not to notice,0.042190604
that the main character of the Irishman is taking stock of his life's work in,0.049105853
a movie that plays like the greatest hits album of the director that made it,0.037905492
from the genre to the soundtrack to the locations to the players involved I don't,0.013356888
even know how to judge the Irishman against the rest of Scorsese's filmography like you,0.06348712
know it just feels like it's so in conversation with his career it's hard to,0.04123806
place it among the other works in his career but you know regardless of whether,0.031866953
or not this will live on as one of his best movies you know too,0.030961638
soon to tell it certainly feels like both a piece of a hole and also,0.3455206
