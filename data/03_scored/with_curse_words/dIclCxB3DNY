it was a great movie that's all you need to know welcome back today we're,0.082077235
talking about a star is born at my school there was a pretty screening for,0.060492024
the movie so as you know the movies coming out on October 5th so we're,0.058827635
gonna talk about the movie plot a review of the movie and there's gonna be,0.06040808
a lot of spoilers I'm not a movie critic so I'm not gonna use official,0.09194765
terms like the rising action and stuff so I'm just gonna talk out of my,0.07667755
ass basically so the very beginning of the movie started out with Bradley Cooper who,0.63572854
plays my god what was his name Jackson me so Bradley Cooper plays Jackson main,0.08589742
who is a country singer as and that's like we see within the first few,0.05506307
minutes he is obviously an alcoholic and he is constantly taking pills before and after,0.5728257
his show and then after his show he wants to go drink some more he's,0.07809019
out of liquor so he ends up going to I thought it was pretty obvious,0.09121399
that he was an alcoholic to begin with but so basically afterwards he goes to,0.403243
a bar and it's a drag night at the bar and there's lady gaga and,0.42932975
she was performing La Vie en Rose which is a good song and basically she,0.0911814
falls in love with her boys FY Lady Gaga's not playing a drag queen that,0.4722764
she just happened to be like performing there that night also anyway so he falls,0.18973286
in love with her and then he was like dude that was resin this start,0.14980896
they have chemistry and then like you can see like oh my gosh it's gonna,0.16119424
be an epic love story so then afterwards they go to a bar where they,0.073936604
Lady gaga her character's name is Ali punches this guy who was being basically a,0.47353986
dick to Bradley Cooper's character and I'm like it's all cute like he gives her,0.8606264
peas for her knuckles and then there sitting on a curb he's drunk she's singing,0.4595788
to him and then he like falls in love with her like right then and,0.21514653
then basically stalks there for a little bit but not like in a weird way,0.18731092
like some other movies romanticized stalking then he's like oh like please come to my,0.34376508
show and then she's like okay and then she goes to the show then he's,0.1503454
like by the way that song that you sing the other night you're performing it,0.108958736
right here with me so yeah and then like that started this whole thing where,0.07661012
they went on tour together and Ally became huge but like right like in the,0.063167736
middle of the movie there's just like this dark tone where you're like okay something's,0.20977435
about it like get up so you can see that his drinking problem is getting,0.1321243
progressively worse as they are following more in love with each other it's just like,0.21590242
he was like oh like he's a drunk with that like they add character to,0.4315887
like to that you know usually a movie though just have like a drunk be,0.26983312
a drunk basically the humanized him using human we're like a lot of movies when,0.37729308
they portray drunks they don't portray the human aspect of them so you can see,0.439601
how in love he is with her but he also is struggling with this alcoholism,0.086570434
but it's not being addressed by the right people and then they end up getting,0.12472663
engaged in the end of getting married and then Ali starts like launching her own,0.113022834
career and then at the same time accents career is like starting to fizzle out,0.08291654
and then at one point he even gets replaced by somebody else and then Ali,0.09371418
has like become a huge success but also like her manager is kind of a,0.10695978
dick and wants to change her and then you see like her style changed from,0.88824683
was it down-to-earth country until I pop and I'm like she's even like oh we,0.24508187
need to dye your hair and I don't know it was weird so she changes,0.35365367
a little but then like throughout all of this she gets really successful even wins,0.10969944
like she's nominated for three Grammys wins a Grammy and this is basically when the,0.08476153
whole thing went to and you're like this is what all the like weirdness throughout,0.09861386
the movie has been hinting towards was already at the Grammys and he had been,0.08522318
replaced by somebody so he had to be like a guitarist like the person's guitarist,0.15873422
even though like he was bigger than the other person it just like kind of,0.093744166
hurt his ego so he's got really drunk then he went to go sit down,0.43577167
with Ali it was announced that she won the Grammy but she goes up to,0.046682063
get her award and he like starts going with her but then he stumbles down,0.17438866
falls on the stairs like Jennifer Lawrence and like what was that like 2014 Grammys,0.096790366
or something he eventually stumbles up with her and she's like giving her acceptance speech,0.14662068
and he's standing next to her and he is so drunk and then he pissed,0.7398065
himself onstage at the Grammys and collapsed and it was this whole dramatic thing they,0.16130103
carried him out and he got sent to rehab but the whole time he's in,0.114905834
rehab like Ali's still doing her shows but she misses him a lot like the,0.101896815
the thing about the movie is that they love each other so deeply which is,0.05966265
also part of like why the movies like it's great it's not just a tragic,0.105616994
story about somebody falling in love and then like somebody having alcoholism and then like,0.10101147
both of their lives getting destroyed which is like does happen but it's so it's,0.22610964
so great like it's a great love story so he got sent to rehab everything,0.15060419
seems great he's obviously like a little depressed about everything and he feels so bad,0.3355072
but it seems like he's on the right track to making things happen and it,0.105764166
goes home and now we're going to talk about Ali's manager which I said earlier,0.06377806
was kind of a dick Ali's not the air the manager talks to Jackson and,0.8339936
it's basically like you're a and you're gonna ruin Ali's career if you stay with,0.48477396
her and then so what happens next was just like oh my god it was,0.08032344
so bad cuz he finally seemed like everything was getting back together then like Ali's,0.28270373
got a concert and she was like this is the last concert and then I'm,0.122256406
gonna be home with you all summer because she had actually had a whole tour,0.08217452
in Europe then but she decided to cancel it so she could stay with him,0.088572
because her manager wouldn't agree to let him go with her on the Europe tour,0.120158695
and then so at her last concert he is this huge dramatic scene he distracts,0.40339303
his dog so that his dog won't like I don't know do something and then,0.24072112
he goes and he kills himself in the garage like he hangs himself with a,0.74499655
belt oh it was a saddest scene ever like everybody in like my school's Little,0.17957827
Theater was like and then like you could audibly hear people like starting to cry,0.30295622
and then it's just so sad because afterwards it shows Ali and like the effect,0.06339862
it had on her and you can see how much she really loved him the,0.085628636
way the movie ended was her singing a love song that he had written for,0.13547601
her and that's just basically a short summary of the movie but it doesn't really,0.07270213
do the movie dresses in any way so in conclusion Robbie Cooper is an amazing,0.11389415
actor and director if you didn't know he did direct this movie it was an,0.10578962
amazing movie just the whole time you feel all the raw emotions and it just,0.06645586
seemed so it was great I don't know what's a word and I I know,0.13571146
Lady Gaga has been like in TV shows before I don't think she's ever been,0.28994194
in a movie before I could be wrong but she did she did it a,0.113822125
really good job at portraying somebody with such raw emotion and just somebody who was,0.07958388
so new and innocent to an industry and Bradley Cooper is really good at portraying,0.10168529
a damaged person he's really good at playing the damaged person and that's kind of,0.2966811
scary because you're like how can you be like that but this story is the,0.18585554
type of movie where everybody can feel a connection at some point or another it's,0.06282069
not just one of those movies that you go in for entertainment it's something that,0.0900203
you go in to feel like to completely submerge yourself into a plot and really,0.28725532
like become attached to characters which is what makes the ending so tragic it's a,0.069272794
work of art I highly recommend this movie it's premiering on Thursday that is my,0.100512356
review I got these awesome posters for free it's really a great movie you should,0.092006125
