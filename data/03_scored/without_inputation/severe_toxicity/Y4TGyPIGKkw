when the movie Selma came out it was a hit and a critical darling but,0.040266894
there was significant controversy surrounding it and that was the historical accuracy given that this,0.0113074565
shows intent is to analyze history in film I thought it was about time to,0.021281885
tackle that problem head-on after having watched the movie though I think the fact checkers,0.054084085
have actually gone too far we'll get into that and more because this film shows,0.046667956
you what I've been saying all along on these episodes then it is a good,0.037972674
historical movie if the inaccuracies do not affect the narrative and Selma is just that,0.02254507
a good historical movie an inspirational one at that but it only slips into that,0.04025625
category I had a difficult decision in proclaiming this one good because there are some,0.011957341
problems but I don't think they affect the narrative the civil rights movement had been,0.016378151

to keep black people from registering to vote ensuring that they would stay in an,0.64452434

what the hell is that voting but if your Negro the only way you can,0.7490619
vote is if an approve registered vote of vouchers for you many of those laws,0.0244149
survived the Civil Rights Act because they were technically not racially selective even though in,0.07190968
practice they really were a group called the Dallas County voters League later joined by,0.016314294
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee snick for short had launched a campaign in Selma to,0.039149385

the 50 mile walk from Selma to the state's capital in Montgomery on March 7th,0.01314935

police state troopers and vigilantes attacked the procession in a coordinated and brutal fashion it,0.19334494
was so horrendous that newspapers called the event Bloody Sunday because it was well publicized,0.17749427
thousands of people came from across the country to take part in another march a,0.04442961
second march was staged this time with King and the front of it a court,0.021041755
order had mandated that the March could not cross the county line at the bridge,0.029634597
but when they came to the top of the bridge again the troopers actually made,0.027023751
way for the marchers the entire procession kneeled in prayer and then King turned them,0.036690865
around keeping in line with the court order but confusing the rest of the marchers,0.014056661
because of this the second march became known as turn around Tuesday during the night,0.04395866
the KKK assaulted three white protesters beating one of them so badly that he died,0.5496808
within hours several protests were organized in Montgomery because of the failure of turn around,0.06183148

response a sit-in was staged at the White House to try to get lyndon b,0.0274202

though he had been working on it since Bloody Sunday with perhaps his most famous,0.07690188
speech of his career it's not just Negroes but really it's all of us who,0.5832105
must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and we shall overcome two days,0.0551098
later a federal court ruled in favor of the SCLC s proposed march on Alabama's,0.029731713

protests this movie goes out of its way to be accurate the marchers are staged,0.08607942
to match archival footage and the general Vince line up perfectly the film could not,0.013981495
procure the rights to King's actual speeches which are technically still copyrighted even though they,0.014154443
could have claimed fair use and used the actual words they instead paraphrased quite succinctly,0.015915183
to the point that I thought I was listening to an actual speech at one,0.038611915
point the LBJ speech on the other hand had no qualms with simply quoting him,0.08088766
for the most part actors just nail mannerisms of these folks this recreation of Selma,0.040850922
has been done before so they were retreading some ground but the story is more,0.028137933
involved than selma lord selma and far superior in fidelity and quality the best part,0.036166035
is where the movie shows the way that the whole thing was organized we really,0.018025147
get to see the ideology behind selma and what made it tick we do is,0.027118206
negotiate demonstrate resist and a big part of that is raising fight consciousness and in,0.039334305
particular the consciousness of whichever white man happens to be sitting in the Oval Office,0.27256933
this is important work because too often do we get the X happened which caused,0.026282737
y approach to the civil rights movement but here we get to see the internet',0.020694528
scene fights among civil rights leaders you want us to bring our people in but,0.054441955
you're not giving anything in return now we are asking for some kind of commitment,0.039290402
the motivation for selecting Soma we don't fight and the reason for so much momentum,0.07825486
being necessary in obtaining voting rights there have been thousands of racially motivated murders in,0.34370044
the South including those for girls no the astounding fact that not one of these,0.08661223
criminals who murder us when and why they want has ever been convicted one conviction,0.1907168
because they are protected by flight officials chosen by an all-white electorate and on the,0.17026971
rare occasions that they face trial they are freed by all-white juries Oh for instance,0.43703902
just listen to the speech dismantling your own legacy with each passing day no one,0.07885353
will remember the Civil Rights Act but they will remember the standoff in summer when,0.0048119384
you never even set foot in this state they will remember you saying wait and,0.043934714
I can't unless you act sir that's incredible you really get a sense of what,0.049631346
this fight was all about there are so many other clips I could show but,0.10622584
I'll just say if you haven't watched this movie just go watch it there's not,0.055586737
much here but I'll just run through them real quickly the church bombing that took,0.29168832
out the girls in the beginning was a year earlier than King getting the Nobel,0.08241625
Peace Prize but the movie is showing it to illustrate the speech he made for,0.031628817
receiving the award not to show the chronology the person who attacked King in the,0.12304168
hotel actually punched him twice and kicked him while he was on the ground the,0.6730923
KKK member was sent to jail for a month because of it and fined $100,0.15590906
some of the SCLC leadership was in on the turn around Tuesday secret it was,0.0346115
understood by them as part of complying with the core order and avoiding another Bloody,0.24297297
Sunday but the movie is correct in saying that it was a surprise to everyone,0.01522938
else both of people killed in the movie took a while to die of their,0.45395115
wounds rather than dying on the spot but that's alright since the movie needs to,0.034817707
save time there is one thing that this movie has been going back and forth,0.025860345
over but I think it's unwarranted it is implied that Johnson ordered a blackmail package,0.049289443
sent to King to stop the first Selma March get me J Edgar Hoover historians,0.061613966
are correct in pointing out that there is no evidence to show that Johnson did,0.017808296
this but here's the thing the blackmail thing really did happen they go ruin me,0.11853839
yeah because J Edgar Hoover the unjustifiably powerful director of the FBI had been monitoring,0.0328175
King for years and had caught him cheating on his wife on several occasions the,0.19065493
black mantle incident happened sometime in early 1965 though we don't know when but it,0.16687196
never caused much of an effect on King or his wife because he had already,0.10147244
confessed his wrongdoings to her beforehand so yeah the implication is incorrect but it is,0.1545787
only implied through montage nor does it make a big difference for the narrative instead,0.00943696
we see the differing stances on what needs to be accomplished first between MLK and,0.043191705
LBJ which is quite accurate what the movie gets wrong on this front was that,0.050482783
it does not show the stress that LBJ was under because of Vietnam it keeps,0.036275126
talking about the Great Society legislation that he proposed almost a year prior I'll call,0.019253075
it the war on poverty instead the Vietnam War was escalating exactly during these few,0.05828805
weeks the official ground war began on March 8th a day after Bloody Sunday that,0.2005276
was what was preoccupying LBJ when he said to King something along the lines of,0.045432042
this you've got one big issue now you demanded more and put me on the,0.08069809
spot with this visit that's okay that's your job that's what you do but I,0.040216338
am sick and tired of you demanding and telling me what I can and what,0.085482754
I can't do now historians have been saying that the moving unnecessarily it demonizes LBJ,0.039965563
but I would argue it's easy to see it the other way around he was,0.029535484
more preoccupied with a spurious war than helping people at home yet the movie makes,0.072586834
him out to be more preoccupied with domestic problems in general and political necessity what,0.044702336
he needs to do is get on board with what we're doing instead of the,0.020276127
other way around for once but here's the thing despite it not showing the correct,0.022087423
preoccupation of LBJ's it does show that he was preoccupied and then it was soma,0.036913037
that pushed him to act you see the movie doesn't alter the narrative just tweak,0.023389187
some things to not have to get bogged down in others all movies necessarily cut,0.07487972
stuff this could easily have been a three-hour snorefest like so many other movies but,0.03243502
instead the narrative stays intact and what is cut is not necessary sure I would,0.021651728
like to have seen other civil rights leaders depicted in this like we could have,0.01050325
seen a legion of people trying to register to vote and not just one but,0.02218587
one is all it takes that is why the movie is still good historically despite,0.010179305
its inaccuracies now you know that I research this stuff prior to watching although I,0.028117977
didn't use to so I get really deep into the way that filmmakers react to,0.019479237
fact-checkers I always see the typical pablum of you got this wrong so everything's wrong,0.037226338
or it's just a movie you know the platitudinous argument that is between slender and,0.061174944
artistic license things like this or this I've been doing this series for a while,0.019326245
now and I had to develop a mode of critiquing based on the true stories,0.035910603
but this movie in particular made me have to kind of reassess that being said,0.044601228
I think my original assertion from last year is still correct you don't get to,0.011157125
have artistic license when dealing with the truth not at least if you're changing the,0.013644247
narrative what really set me off on this is when I saw the director of,0.021422239
this movie wrote an editorial saying it's not a documentary I'm not a historian I'm,0.0474848
a storyteller now that's just idiotic historians are also storytellers they're just forced to use,0.32175153
evidence to show that their story is true besides no worthwhile historian claims to be,0.021458825
a hundred percent accurate we make mistakes as I do all the time on this,0.02076903
channel why do you think we're arguing all the time amongst each other just as,0.016414072
historians are allowed to make errors artists are allowed to purposely flub stuff as long,0.06827312
as it does not affect the narrative furthermore there is a difference between facts and,0.00978219
interpretation when historians are angry about what this is the vilification of LBJ and funny,0.040667333
enough most of those historians are from the LBJ library so they have a vested,0.045585036
interest in their particular narrative but as I showed earlier that is an interpretation not,0.018146874
a fact if you can't differentiate between the two then you should make fiction not,0.02503219
based on a true story movies this is a competent movie but if the director,0.027062332
is going to be this kind of foolish then maybe she should stay away from,0.31620014
these kinds of movies from now on with real people and true stories you don't,0.02771022
get to take artistic license to the point of changing the actual narrative without incurring,0.033196654
the ire of the historical community that's simply falsifying the past instead of arguing whether,0.026170986
it's right to fact-check movies which it undoubtedly is we should be trying to find,0.01805242
out if the narrative of the movie diverges enough from reality to be inaccurate history,0.02568274
is the story of us and Selma is an important component of that story so,0.012711659
telling it correctly is vital to understanding ourselves it is a building block to reality,0.036463372
and to be inaccurate as in to get the overall narrative incorrect is simply to,0.02473552
breed ignorant so how does this movie stack up to this measure does it actually,0.3849626
help us understand reality does the movie Selma misrepresent the actual Vence narrative no it,0.016873049
actually strengthens it and gives it new life it has its faults but none too,0.048493218
great to affect the narrative and that's what counts Selma is a good based on,0.033074927
