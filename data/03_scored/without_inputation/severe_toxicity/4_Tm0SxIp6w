so you have a wonder woman sequel for me yes sir i do so we're,0.19091237
gonna start the movie with diana as a kid back in themyscira okay okay and,0.21015745
what's she up to well she's competing in the amazon version of that tv show,0.025789835
wipeout and she tries to use a shortcut to win and learns that cheating is,0.07636042
wrong sure okay that's a nice quick message to start the movie off it's gonna,0.10069683
take a full 11 minutes oh my god so then we're going to jump forward,0.100848496
to the 1980s which is when this movie takes place okay okay so like 30,0.03883209
40 years ago oh i don't enjoy that that's a true thing so anyway diana,0.07604446
is still super heartbroken about steve trevor dying in the first movie he's all she,0.071169995
can think about really after all that time yeah well i mean you gotta understand,0.07588748
this was a really good guy she knew for a couple of days seven decades,0.027897801
ago well yeah i guess so so anyway diane is working in washington dc at,0.040251594
the smithsonian and she has a new co-worker named barbara what's her deal oh she's,0.039867118
a freaking nerd sir she can't even walk in heels oh embarrassing disgusting and pathetic,0.76386225
i bet nobody likes her yeah and so there's this artifact called the dream stone,0.08694017
and that's what this movie's going to focus on oh what's this thing dude oh,0.03058847
this thing's freaking nuts it grants wishes but it takes something in return a very,0.37820047
magical stone and this phony business guy max lord he gets his hand on it,0.16066447
and he wishes to become the dreamstone oh so he turns to stone you would,0.09857756
think so the way that was phrased but no now he can grant people's wishes,0.029919295
when they touch him and he can take something in return do barbara and diana,0.08319785
get wishes in before he does that they do barbara wishes to be more like,0.049489
diana so she gets some nice clothes and some super strength and now she can,0.08606545
walk in heels now that's impressive am i right yeah she's not pathetic anymore also,0.30516905
she removes her glasses which as you know makes people automatically more attractive that's just,0.1033722
good character development is what that is and so diana's gonna wish for steve trevor,0.03229134
to come back to life and this way we could get chris pine back in,0.10739456
the movie oh people like chris pine so what does he just appear out of,0.06748554
thin air actually no his consciousness goes into this random guy's body so everybody sees,0.17816745
this random guy but we see chris pine okay is this because the stone can't,0.06658887
make things just magically show up no it absolutely can a giant wall is going,0.050614487
to appear out of nowhere so are some nukes i mean the thing is magic,0.117051035
why are we doing this weird body control thing with steve i don't know what,0.08653308
happens to this guy's consciousness while steve's controlling his body who's to say you are,0.18610974
yeah what if this guy has a job and a family he has to get,0.05311957
to the implications are insane where is his consciousness is he dead oh well here's,0.15840085
the thing sir i'm gonna need you to get all the way off my back,0.061534144
about this body control thing get off of it oh that felt vaguely threatening so,0.056492716
i'm gonna get off your back about that great and so then steve and diana,0.18906981
obviously they get intimate because you know they love each other they do that using,0.06635606
a stranger's body that's got that's got to be crossing a line that's not okay,0.044428945
yeah well we're going to have them do it anyway and i find it strange,0.066083334
that you immediately got back on my back about that i mean it's actually a,0.049648643
really easy fix just have steve trevor show up as himself no so then that,0.050498083
max lord guy makes himself super rich and he goes to egypt to take some,0.03656315
guy's oil and make himself even richer okay so steve and diana they gotta get,0.056074318
over there you know how are they gonna do that well the thing is they,0.014551558
can't just take a commercial flight because steve doesn't have a passport no i mean,0.02357943
the guy he's possessing probably has one yeah well they don't check for that they,0.02979557
head to the smithsonian and steal one of the jets from over there they have,0.22347367
operational jets at the museum they do yeah fully fuel jets just lying around so,0.046783697
they take one of those because steve was a pilot okay he was a pilot,0.046426494
in world war one these are those those are different planes well i mean a,0.13286445
plane is a plane that's i mean okay yeah that sentence is not technically wrong,0.036498625
so there you go but okay sir a plane is a plane are you implying,0.026429743
that a plane's not a plane because a plane is a plane i mean that's,0.037612144
just such a vague general statement a plane is a plane okay so then they're,0.08561712
being chased because of the jet theft and so wonder woman goes ahead and makes,0.054398052
it invisible and that's how she gets her invisible jet what how well turns out,0.05336303
that's a thing she can do so she does the thing that she can do,0.026967876
well thank god she has that ability we never once mentioned a reference it works,0.044784818
out great so they go to egypt and they have a big chase scene with,0.07239061
max lord oh very exciting but he freaking gets away and he goes around causing,0.23662831
a bunch more chaos then he goes to see the president of the united states,0.14129698
what for well he gets the president to wish for more nukes and then he,0.09689797
sees this technology just lying around in the oval office and it's exactly what he,0.13927615
needs what do you mean what's this device that lets him take over everybody's screen,0.061485585
around the world so technically through like satellite waves he is you know he's touching,0.06610063
them how i don't worry about it okay it won't so then there's gonna be,0.049252857
this fight in the white house and barbara she's turning evil so she gets in,0.23995365
on that too okay and steve manages to grab max lord oh and so he,0.068656266
wishes for everything to go back to normal oh yeah no that would have been,0.0576508
smart instead he pushes him around a bit also a decent strategy yeah so then,0.033748094
max lord escapes and he heads off to the satellite island to do his broadcast,0.22520393
wow wow wow and steve and diana find out that everybody needs to renounce their,0.05978604
wishes or else civilization's gonna end so they have this big emotional goodbye oh very,0.08158278
sad very sad but then she starts to fly and lasso some lightning bolts so,0.042009007
that's pretty cool that's that's not bad oh sure yeah that may as well happen,0.033704855
so then diana's gonna have to fight barbara who by the way is a cat,0.15814808
now what yeah she's a cat now she's part cheetah what are you talking about,0.07293938
well see max lord was like hey anything else you want and she's like yes,0.045322955
actually i would like to be an apex predator please so she could have just,0.23161209
as easily been turned into a killer whale yeah i guess there was a chance,0.18849975
she could have turned into a you know orca whale but that would have made,0.070874654
for a less interesting fight scene oh i wholeheartedly disagree anyway so then we're gonna,0.0590264
have a barely visible fight scene and barbara's gonna get electrocuted oh so she dies,0.42557797
oh no she gets a little sleepy which is what happens when cats get electrocuted,0.09682546
that's not no i don't think that's accurate well that's what my dad told me,0.022919567
when my childhood cat chewed through his extension cord that your cat died i think,0.38766724
no sir he went to sleep then he went to live on a farm and,0.06289378
i never saw him again i mean okay so what happens next oh well max,0.10414647
is granting wishes to everybody in the world through their screens most of the world,0.062400214
doesn't speak english okay yeah i'll keep that in mind for trivia night i guess,0.06846802
that's interesting anyway it's gonna be complete chaos oh it is yep people are killing,0.13322166
each other with wishes one guy gets a farm outside his apartment people can wish,0.05156304
for anything really yeah it's gonna be nuts statistically speaking wouldn't at least one person,0.080769256
wish for the guy that just showed up on their tv to die or for,0.27495024
the world to end wouldn't at least one person wish for world peace what happens,0.0517892
with that paradox well i mean that's got that's like a one in a million,0.05376147
kind of wish right there are billions of people in the world you're just full,0.07913956
of fun trivia tonight so anyway diana has to lasso this guy but her lasso,0.11003667
can't get through this mysterious wind around him oh wow it's gonna be tough for,0.025085406
her to defeat him if she can't reach him actually it's gonna be super easy,0.10633094
barely an inconvenience oh really yeah see she gets her lasso around his ankle and,0.086498484
then she can talk to everybody through him i thought she couldn't get through with,0.06425408
that thing oh yeah no she couldn't but then she could but how unclear well,0.0950288
okay then so then she tells everybody to renounce their wishes because nothing good comes,0.08362356
from lying and everybody does it everybody does it including max lord who suddenly cares,0.11363598
about his son that he's been actively ignoring the whole movie and so what about,0.050884552
like what if someone with a terminal illness wished to be cured oh well they,0.25614208
would have they would have to renounce that because that's that's not the truth uh,0.043123856
what if a blind person wished to be able to see that's uh that's that's,0.111591876
a shortcut uh to being able to see so that's that's wrong what if somebody,0.047849987
wished to be able to feed their starving child yeah okay this moment only works,0.24333134
if everybody wishes for something selfish or violent so we're gonna have to pretend like,0.048956852
that's the case okay oh pretending is tight okay let's do it okay thank god,0.10106933
so then max lord is gonna go reunite with his son who just kind of,0.036657605
comes running out of the woods for no reason how did max lord get back,0.040822987
from the island if he renounced all his wishes unclear and what happens with barbara,0.048401423
well she's not a cat anymore and she's she's chilling i imagine okay anyway then,0.19495668
diana's gonna have a little flirty moment with the guy who steve was controlling it's,0.0817371
gonna be very sweet he's already seen that guy naked yeah just a real sweet,0.30413067
moment it's gonna be christmas too yeah i don't know if it being christmas makes,0.034638107
it better and then she looks at a balloon and we're all done so what,0.037451833
do you think i mean i feel like using a strange man's body is just,0.114559256
so deeply strange and raises so many messed up questions right right right well maybe,0.020900736
nobody will think of how weird it is well yeah i guess that is a,0.04938656
possibility okay let's do it hey guys ryan here thanks for watching that pitch meeting,0.061276052
