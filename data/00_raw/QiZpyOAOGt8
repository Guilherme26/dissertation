you saved the entire world i'm such a cry baby hey guys so today's movie commentary hmm i get so many comments about arrival i have seen a rival and i get so sick of telling people in the comments i've seen it i've seen it i've seen it i alternate between films where they're like funny jokes where they're cheesy where like i can just sing along or laugh to then like jumping back to something which is more critically acclaimed it should be interesting to revisit this i remember that there's aliens and amy adams and jeremy renner and i think forrest whitaker is in this too it's about language and trying to communicate with them but i was discussing with someone about how i've seen it but i don't really remember anything from it i don't remember everything i don't think so it's kind of a re-watch but also i feel like i might be surprised by certain things possibly maybe we'll see everyone's saying it in the comments all the time i just kind of got sick of it so i thought why not just like re-watch it together because then i can just say it's on my channel i can just like copy paste it into the comments i've seen it it's on my channel it's on my channel stop hassling me about it i feel like i should do more denis films like i've i think i've seen all of his films except for incendi's yeah i guess let's jump into this so i mentioned this on my twitter the other day i find it so so funny i find it like actually hilarious when i read these comments where people tell me stop talking you talk too much like just watch the movie it's literally in the title it says movie commentary like this film goes for nearly two hours this video will go for like 20 25 minutes i'm not talking throughout the entire film you do realize that right majority of the time that i'm sitting here i'm actually not speaking i'm literally watching the movie these are just like highlights this is the portions of the movie that i'm talking at least majority of them i don't know why i actually have to put that out there like if you want to watch the movie with no one talking i don't know why you're watching a movie commentary video i feel like putting the definition of commentary on the screen right now [Applause] [Music] i used to think this was the beginning of your story on the nature of daylight by matt uh max richard it's already playing it's already playing this opening scene i don't i i'm gonna cry my tissue is sitting over there in case i start crying imagine losing your child like your child when they're a teenager or a baby or just it happens to so many people but it's just that's so unfair now i'm not so sure i believe in beginnings and endings there are days that define your story beyond your life like the day they arrived ends in beginnings why am i getting dark vibes guys do we believe in an end in the beginning where is everyone okay well let's get started literally for uni i turn up for like the first lecture the next like three months i don't even go to the lectures and if they're recorded which majority of them are i don't usually listen to them that was me in uni i don't i'm not i don't study anymore but that was me in uni that was pretty much me if they're not compulsory then i wouldn't go to them do people not have their phones on silent i always have my phone on silent who wants beeps and tones and stuff coming off all the time it's so frustrating mom please don't bother with that channel how many times do i have to tell you those people are idiots choose your media sources wisely and correctly because there are so many people out there and like news telecasts and journalists that just speak absolutely [ __ ] like total [ __ ] i love that she's sleeping hugging a pillow that is so subtle like a way of showing me maybe that she's lonely or missing like comfort and companionship you know a lot of people do that with pillows like they want to be able to hold something or hug someone there's like literally things that you can buy like like human size that you can cuddle when you're sleeping the atf has put a temporary ban on new gun licenses forcing many independent suppliers of hunting equipment and firearms to close their doors to the public piss off firearms should not be your priority right now i can tell you that it's impossible to translate from an audio file i would need to be there to interact with them i feel like this was a whole new language that they created right for this film that they like did this from scratch like made an actual full language i could be making this up but i feel like that's a thing oh jeremy renner he's the map oh i just kicked the camera my bad i like jeremy right now when he's put in good roles he's really good like he's actually a really good actor he made me cry in endgame he made me cry given good movies i am down for that how about we just talk to them before we start throwing math problems at them this is why you're both here opposites working together i like that the importance is trying to find common ground common ground between opposites you're not going to get anywhere unless you have the opposite ends of the spectrum to work together that's just general knowledge people where do you expect us to get anywhere if people don't [ __ ] work together we're going to get [ __ ] all done zero productivity dude like come on come on that aerial shot that swooping aerial shot is just denise that looks like miniatures that literally they look like miniatures does that look like not look like a miniature set to you guys because it does to me i love that like 360 swooping around i love that that's amazing put these on you're going to wear them at all times that um military guy that was there before he's the decade from ready or not he's the husband from ready or not oh my god that movie if you haven't checked out my commentary for that that was eventful that was an eventful commentary and very entertaining the use of the orange is so just like kind of finding it hard today to articulate my words i don't know why but the orange just makes them stand out so much in regards to how cool toned the rest of the scenery is the entire um color scheme is so dull so i love that they're in orange suits i love that you know what that reminds me of it reminds me of like a contact lens not that i have contact lenses but it looks like a disc kind of like an eye like a not a puke like a pupil i don't know i don't know is that giving you um 2001 as face odyssey sort of vibes that shot i haven't seen that movie i know i know i know what is wrong with me guys huh i feel like i'm gonna like look at this movie and be like i like that shot that shot is gorgeous do you like that shot because i like that shot that looks beautiful [Music] who [ __ ] loves this sound design in this school huh who's on the same page as me let's turn this volume up guys obviously they need to use animals to be able to tell if they're safe they're not going to use humans obviously still poor birdie what if the birdie died i don't want the birdie to die the tension of this movie my ears are in heaven right now after this i am so watching behind the scenes videos guys i need to know how this [ __ ] was bloody made what they used to make the sound of them how they made the language the special effects the design my brain needs to know how this happened how this worked their website claims the arrival of the aliens set in motion a prophecy the 12 sets of 12 should be followed this kind of thing just brings on the bloody maniac people that are just believe in absolute total [ __ ] the minority are so much more vocal than the silent majority i'd be shaking i wouldn't be able to deal i would not be able to deal if i was her no way would i last i would majorly fail as my position as her i'd be like nope not gonna happen amazing amazing it's like squid ink but like smoky like squid that is so cool that's incredible yes it is incredible wow oh special effects amy adams is amazing she's such a great actress she's in so many roles like so many roles and i just adore her and her eyes are so blue she has the most blue eyes contamination they need to see me back doctor she's walking towards the screen i don't i don't think you're really going to be able to convince her otherwise just let her do her thing if she dies that's on herself that's her own that's her own fault oh my god that sh oh wow oh oh god the goddamn oh the texture on there like skin so detailed ew that's actually kind of gross it's actually kind of gross ew louise i am louise screw it just take it off imagine if they just died just like bam dead dead on the spot they have names what are we going to call them bob and jeff well that was totally off book oh but he's not happy ready or not guy is not happy he doesn't seem very pleased looks like a giraffe what is that horse why did i say giraffe looks like a giraffe here are some of the many things we don't know about heptapods greek hepta seven pod foot seven feet heptapod i think that exposition exposition each scene was very much needed subtle and it wasn't just like info dump dump which was good it was like providing us with knowledge that we need just to sort of recap you know how exposition scenes can be like that where they're just like damn here is all your information that you need damn the same government who ruined our healthcare and bankrupted our military look at these people most of them don't even have guns who needs [ __ ] roof guns are not the [ __ ] solution oh she's hugging her daughter like she was hugging her pillow oh how sad i don't think that that makes me unfit to do this job the one thing that's really stood out to me so far is the lighting like i feel like we haven't really gotten many harsh contrasts in the lighting it's very soft and luminous really like that i just i love the way that lighting is used in this movie our language like a culture is messy and sometimes one can be both and it's quite possible that they're asking us to offer them something not the other way around you go to google translate and write in a word for like a certain language for it to be translated into another language it can be something completely different this is absolutely frustrating [ __ ] off [ __ ] off i already have like a passionate hate for him already all people want is to [ __ ] kill other people and create hate and war in the world i know you have to be safe and protect your borders and protect your country but that's not going to get us anywhere no don't disconnect from australia no no we need to be talking to each other we want to talk exactly communication i can't believe they explode they try and [ __ ] send off a [ __ ] bomb a bomb you pieces of [ __ ] you're all piece of this [ __ ] [ __ ] you i can't belie actually no that's not far-fetched that's honestly not ridiculous like that's not something that wouldn't happen like obviously that's gonna happen we've been attempting to hail captain marks the escort units are not responding sir why not said security the escort units aren't responding it's because they're [ __ ] murderers they're murderers i get angry but i just i don't want to deal with hateful people i don't knock knock who's there so what they're gonna kill other humans so they can kill the two heptapods so they can kill albert and costello they're going to kill other humans other military people who are probably their friends people they work with that has no logic that has no no logic i don't know which one it was but they protected them he protected them and saved them oh my god they are not harmful to humankind they're not said the aliens have 24 hours to leave chinese territory or face destruction and he urged all other world leaders to unite with china and take a similar stance no no no it's a non-zero sum game non-zero sum game what the [ __ ] have i forgotten about this movie like they're giving have given her powers this is so frustrating me oh can she see oh she can see future events she can see oh oh my god it's coming back to me it's coming back to me now okay okay my i i remember i kind of remember the ending i kind of remember the ending now yes yes yes yes hop in get in there i don't know how i feel about the hair how do you guys feel about the hair do you think it looks good i think it looks good but a little something doesn't feel right oh it's so much bigger than they thought has it got a head oh my god oh that shot oh my god that's so cool how can you know the future because we're aliens that's how we do the future because we're aliens from out of space mommy and daddy talk to animals [Music] oh my god yes the bird oh okay okay now it's all clicking imagine being able to see the future i think all of it's coming back to me so the technology that they gave her technology or weapon in their language because obviously they're still struggling to communicate the weapon is being able to open time and so all these flashbacks are actually her seeing the future of her daughter her daughter's future and mommy and daddy mummy daddy see the future jeremy rena is her husband and they have the child but then they get a force okay okay yeah yep i told him something that he wasn't ready to hear what that you're dead that you're going to die that you're oh that's so sad honey your daddy didn't leave you you're going to see him this weekend he doesn't look at me the same way anymore of course he doesn't she told him that she dies i just realized why my husband loved me are you remarried not past tense future tense future tense i will be married well your name is very special because it is palindrome it reads the same forward and backward because at the beginning she said when it comes to time we don't know if when there is the ending when there is the beginning because she's open with time now like time is open so so you can see what's to come the time it it isn't the same for them it's non-linear i love how she's saying like the language is non-linear because when you think linear you think like straight you know start and end but they're the way that it's visually representated is like a circle it's round like i just find that so interesting how visually the language reflects the concept and idea of how the language actually works the design of it the design just like that blows my mind it was an honor to work with good luck good luck having a child that eventually will pass away and my husband will leave me because i tell him that our daughter dies from a rare disease and had her anyway because i wanted to have her but also that's so difficult that's so difficult of a choice you're the reason for this unification all because you reached out to me on my private number how do people come up with these things like writers filmmakers just uh astound me you're quite sure who i you are committing an act of treason yeah to save the entire world you save the entire world imagine if like stuff that happens in sci-fi films is real could you imagine like close encounters like what's the one with jodie foster i s contact like insane imagine if we had all of these abilities and all these things we're capable of these things and we're flashing back to the beginning of the movie the beginning is the end the end is the beginning i love that concept so [ __ ] much it just messes with your brain i love them together they are i love their chemistry they're amazing daddy [Music] oh i'm tearing up oh i wasn't meeting them is meeting you i'm such a crybaby music makes me so emotional i cry so much in movies [Music] this [ __ ] movie wow incredible why did i get it so get me so emotional that ending on the nature of daylight is it has its own section in the credits yes that song just has its own tiny little section in those credits it just [ __ ] helped i re-watched my favorite films over and over again so many times but i never re-watch this what is wrong with me thinking back on it now they foreshadowed a lot of different things like the part where she said go ask your father because he's the scientist like that's hinting at how ian is her father because he's the mathematician it's kind of therapeutic sitting down and talking to you guys going through like all the recurring events in this movie letting it come back to me sink in understanding it i want to know was this nominated for stuff was this nominated for best picture winner of sound editing yes so happy with that but it was nominated for best picture achievement and directing so director adapted screenplay was nominated for cinematography film editing sound mixing production design oh my god it was like nominated for everything denis you are a genius you are a genius sean levy sean levy why is its name sound familiar oh my god he's a producer for stranger things he's canadian too oh so he was a producer how many produce 14 producers holy [ __ ] i'm so happy i rewatched it on my channel with you guys because i wasn't even planning on it on doing this but i definitely got a new perspective and experience on this film okay well let me know your thoughts on arrival if it's your favorite denis film what you enjoyed about it if you didn't like it that's your opinion everyone's allowed to love or hate whatever movies they like i knew at some point i was gonna cry because i i usually majority of the time cry at some point in a movie i hope you guys enjoyed and i'll talk to you guys later bye
