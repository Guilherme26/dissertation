what's up everybody and welcome back to another movie review I'm chase Lee in the movie I want to take a look at right,0.082565196
now is the fair,0.05465943
well now this one comes from a 24 and it is written and directed by Lulu Wang and this one stars Aquafina yes that Aquafina from crazy rich Asians and she stars as Billie and her and her and her family live in the United States,0.49330974
and her dad gets a call from his aunt his mother's sister and she says hey your mother's,0.57065564
got stage,0.073149905
4 cancer,0.3162944
she's not gonna last long just letting you know,0.1513143
and so this really kind of puts him into you know like a downward spiral a little bit,0.27275625
he's like well we gotta go,0.118520476
we gotta go see her and so you know going from the u.s. to China is not a cheap flight and so they they spend a lot of money to go over there rightfully,0.15459976
so it's you know one of the family members getting sick but they what they do is,0.15751517
they staged a wedding from for Billy's cousin and they that's how they bring everyone together from all over,0.09730909
the world to go to this wedding so they could basically be around her grandmother you know before she passes and just spend as much time with her as possible before the day eventually comes,0.1837278
and you know we've all been there we've it's it's not it's not fun,0.08495268
but spending as much time as you can with loved one before they go,0.07176695
he's very important and that's what they do here,0.099407054
they just do it in a very funny way,0.061649516
and so you know going into this,0.074084915
I heard a lot about this movie from Sundance,0.08989717
this is where I heard the most pop from and I I was like oh wow with the farewell aquafina drama,0.08206137
well what is this,0.05962215
I have to see this pronto so you know from Sundance until now which is like seven months,0.07643815
you know,0.07163658
I've been hearing nothing but great things,0.1092359
and I solved the trailer to it,0.061486557
and I was like this looks like a really great movie like just a a solid straightforward,0.11123759
good movie,0.06150708
so I walked out of the movie and I hate a 24 because every time when I see a good movie I have to reorganize my top 10 list yet again it gets a little annoying,0.30974057
you know for first firstworldproblems indeed do not feel sorry for me,0.11657864
no,0.06626663
this is a wonderful film it is absolutely touching it's heartbreaking,0.13222255
it's funny poignant,0.07681646
it's just,0.056531064
it's a really well-balanced movie and it's it's so straightforward so simple its bare-bones type of filmmaking but it resonates with not only like me but I think it'll resonate with like everyone else that watches this movie it's it's just it's a wholesome movie that everyone can go and join everyone can appreciate with that being said it is a 24,0.09492569
first-ever pg-rated film I know kind of weird right,0.15201327
if you saw midsummer like that's borderline nc-17 is just really funny to go from that one to this one,0.14827344
and this one is a film that while everyone can enjoy it,0.05802312
which is fantastic,0.058371436
I love movies like that that was just pure crowd-pleasers that um everyone can kind of a kind of grasp onto it,0.18604231
and so what I really appreciated about Lulu Wang's kind of writing and directing is that she doesn't have to make a flashy movie she doesn't have to make something and hold our attention for every three seconds with like an explosion or like a fast cut or anything,0.15515348
absurd like that it is such a straightforward story and it's really just down to its simplicity,0.25643373
that makes it so beautiful,0.10779604
you have a film that opens up with Billie and her parents they hear about the news and then they're Amelie in China and from that point on all we do is just see the interactions between each family member,0.15147883
and then the movie ends it is one of the it's probably the simplest movie I've seen all year the reason why resonates so well is because she knows that it's a simple story and you have to elevate it with great writing and great characters to start with the writing the writing is sharp,0.06358534
it's it's on point in the the comedy work,0.13270727
she never would think a movie about death there would be as much comedy either as there is,0.17143689
but listen there's a lot of goofy families out there,0.67030114
and I appreciate that this family has enough personality to wear even in its darkest times in this movie people can still be a little lighter in the next scene and just enjoy each other's company and that's where the comedy comes from it feels very realistic doesn't even feel like I'm watching actors those look I'm watching,0.06738204
there's a real family go through this real struggle,0.094421126
and Aquafina is you know you know kind of sharp comedic timing does work in some scenes because it once again it shows that she has personality,0.14904629
and the whole family has personality as well that they're able to kind of bounce off of her her improv and her jokes and everyone else's you know might crack a joke whatever it's just it felt so natural and so organic and then while it while it is you know got a lot of heart and a lot of humor to it,0.15244587
it does have a lot of somberness,0.06495308
it does have a lot of subtlety and a lot of nuance in its storytelling,0.13114406
its character development and acting with its characters,0.09191443
this isn't a movie that like feels like it was made under a Hollywood microscope where we have to write every single character you know crying in hysteria because their grandmother is just it's going what Lulu does fantastically and balances so well is that she she captures what it is like in the final moments of someone that's about to pass everyone in this movie breaks down at different moments,0.09715411
no one breaks down at the same moment,0.10095259
and that's what I love about it at first,0.085720465
you know Billie is like kind of hesitant to go because like her grandmother's about to die,0.6364068
but as the movie coming keeps going,0.060788855
she has her moments where she breaks her cousin has his moment when he breaks at the most unfortunate situation which can apply to the comedy area her dad has a nice moment,0.14939235
her uncle has a nice moment,0.23774095
and Anton cause it's just everyone has their moment to shine and they are,0.055495825
they're all kind of coping with it in there either own speed,0.120074295
and that's where I found once again very realistic about it very very grounded and just kind of honest to how humans react to this stuff and just once again there's nuance to the way they are written it,0.05686471
they're the times that they kind of kind of break down or unexpected,0.21482521
I I don't really know,0.12672183
well like how the movie is gonna kind of treat these characters how they're gonna kind of weaving out their emotions,0.12699197
and that's what is kind of so beautiful about it is because everyone's human in this movie everyone feels like a real human just kind of coping with this thing in different ways,0.320714
and I really love the kind of grieving process that each of these family members kind of go through and on top of all that their connection is wonderful once again it feels like a real family uncles aunts cousins the parents the grandparents grandparents siblings,0.08294507
it's just like everyone was bouncing bouncing off of each other,0.19496757
so well that once again goes back to Lulu lanes direction,0.072859436
and what I was saying with the writing is that balance,0.069624625
it's all about balance ping-pong hanging back and forth showing what she excuse-me needs to show excuse me,0.20722389
I don't know what that was showing what she needs to show and doing it in such a meaningful manner nothing ever feels wasted,0.22090423
this is such an airtight movie and is well edited,0.1826163
you know for its hour-and-a-half runtime,0.14865293
it's a short movie but short sweet into the point,0.14556178
and that is the best way to describe it going to the nuance of the acting,0.06051999
this is it's really funny when I saw last year aquafina and crazy rich Asians I was like alright she's got some like Melissa McCarthy vibes she's she's an interesting supporting character,0.5104722
and she's got so much personality,0.19547516
it's so bubbly and inviting you she's the type of person that you want to go hang out with,0.6287379
I have a drink with and discuss life with she does a complete 180 in this movie and I absolutely love it her her subtlety in her her emotional stakes in this movie are so high she picks the right moments to explode,0.37037662
her character with where you know she's talking with her mom and she's she's had enough in what she has to yell at her,0.31089434
you know um one scene where she's talking in English to one of the doctors in the hospital and her grandmother can't hear but you can tell that her eyes are like tearing up because she's hearing like the the news in an honest way because the doctor is keeping everything hidden from her I I didn't look into it,0.14634462
I don't know if that's a cultural thing in China where if people are dying if they ever struck with an illness,0.49074438
and they only have like a few months to live or something,0.07834695
I don't know if it is culture to keep them in the dark like that and just let them die peacefully you know I'm not opposed to it,0.60481757
I think that's fantastic and it kind of keeps them less paranoid and just kind of lets them go peacefully I guess yeah you know I I see no issue with it,0.35139617
but if that's a cultural thing please let me know down below but um yeah it's just uh they they keep up,0.17677526
this lie,0.30380425
you know pretty well and it just takes a lot of it takes a lot of toll on these these actors and these actresses and everyone is just it's so somber and so kind of beautiful and poetic with their performances I really enjoyed and Aquafina is fantastic everything you've heard about her and this movie is very warranted,0.155603
she is outstanding a couple couple things and I'll go and wrap this up the second thing is speaking of the cultural thing it doesn't matter,0.15271331
if you're from China if you're from Japan Taiwan any Asian territory any European territory American territory whatever everyone can enjoy this,0.15314062
you don't have to be Chinese to enjoy this film,0.29023182
this is a film about family,0.06030727
it's about love,0.07734674
it's about compassion,0.08316146
it's about the grieving process,0.045198675
it is once again a human thing everyone that is a human being can enjoy this movie it is a universally made movie,0.12356669
that's what I love about it,0.06584264
everyone can watch this movie and be like I've been there,0.0658755
I've done that,0.05537764
so yeah I mean you know I adds a grandmother that passed last year and so I kind of did everything that was done in this movie like I lied to myself about it,0.18076704
I'm sure everyone else lied to themselves about it,0.19003905
and you know when the day came it hit you or maybe a hit you a day later they day,0.42704308
or two later,0.04889554
you know it's just it's it's interesting how people people cope with it,0.081968315
and just watch this movie brought brought a lot of those memories back and it's it's you know death is uh it's inevitable,0.20008112
but it's a it's an interesting process,0.06282375
that's all I'll say,0.047487672
and the last thing I want to say before I wrap this up is that Lulu Wang while making a simplistic story did not skimp on the visual aesthetic of the film the one thing I really appreciate about the cinematography is not only is it clean,0.094838984
it's you know it's clear,0.051920705
it's it's just really nice cinematography excuse me she plays with the framing a little bit,0.2480251
if you are making a movie you know typically if you have a shot like this,0.2408881
you want to have about that much Headroom between your head in the top of the frame if you want to make it a shot interesting if you have them over here and like the third right there or excuse me right,0.3652858
right,0.04255815
there like there's a third there's a third and there's a third,0.08650594
you can have their faces right there you could have you know extreme close-ups and see like their face,0.31678143
there's many ways you can frame a scene and she could have easily made this visually boring,0.14920737
but what I love about it it's just,0.0780781
it's just subtle things like this small little things matter folks she has most of her her characters like this we're like the top of their head is hitting the halfway point in the frame and so it's mainly just like their head in like a little bit of their their chest area in the bottom half of the frame and so I was thinking myself like why is she doing this,0.29228848
and I came up to the conclusion that I think she did it this way because the situation that this family is going through with you know the grandmother experiencing this and them experiencing the the grief and the inevitability of her death is that the situation weighs on them,0.16388057
so if the situation is weighing on them,0.07897395
it's just kind of like pushing them down a little bit and like their bodies are sinking with it,0.37862536
and that's that's how I interpret it,0.06770055
it could be something completely different,0.03305029
she could be like I just did it cuz,0.106804445
it looked good what you does it adds a little bit of uniqueness to the film,0.077274665
but that's what I got him is that the situation is weighing on them so much that's actually pushing them down in the frame once again just adding a nice little extra layer to the film guys,0.14975537
this is a wonderful film it's a it's an honest film about family and about death,0.2362722
it's a funny film it's wholeheartedly just fantastic,0.10503462
I have nothing bad to say about this movie it is a straightforward movie it's airtight everything about it works for me,0.12824917
I love the farewell quite a bit,0.08245411
I know my fiancee did too so I'm going to give the farewell an A it deserves an A I have no issues with it it's gonna make the top ten eventually I just need to figure out that list,0.08445784
but thank you a 24 for three great ones in a row,0.06658254
you can stop now cuz it's getting ridiculous,0.605056
no keep coming,0.09348254
yeah,0.040847696
so if you've seen the farewell please comment down below and let me know but until that until that let me know anything else down below and that will do it for this review guys,0.10004585
I'm chase Lee and tune in next time for whatever I review next,0.07513738
