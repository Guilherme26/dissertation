hi I'm Andre,
I'm a black nerd with a review for you the new reviews Thor Ragnarok I'm gonna give it a good I'm gonna be the bad I'm gonna be the nerdy,0.6292747
so I'm not gonna spoil everything about the movie but I will talk into detail about some of the plots in the movie so that could be seen as spoilers,0.06414657
I did a video earlier this week where I actually went to the Thor Ragnarok premiere and I gave a little mini review at the end of that video about how I felt about the movie in general,0.055408634
so if you want no spoilers I would recommend checking out that I would actually just recommend checking out the video in general because Tessa Thompson may or may not be in it just sayin and someone may or may not have met her just sayin,0.09120303
I also love the fact that I saw this movie incredibly early,0.093782194
and yet I'm still one of the last people to actually review it on YouTube,0.19149557
it's even earlier that I see a movie though later I review it,0.1096517
I'm terrible at this,0.15525219
I should just quit I'm not gonna quit,0.12184179
I can never quit you no matter what your comment say what can I say about,0.15157482
Thor Ragnarok let me point this out to you and I mean this as a positive compliment,0.09277034
let's say you took your favorite Saturday morning cartoon from the 80s and 90s and you said okay Saturday morning cartoon,0.10949959
I know you're cheap and just made to sell toys,0.47653124
but what if I gave you a good director a good script and a good budget to do whatever you want and make an awesome movie but still like a Saturday morning cartoon,0.105361916
that's the Ragnarok this movie is so freaking fun,0.4719733
if I feel like Laura Ragnarok finally embraces and accepts the world that it's in feel like now that we've gotten past the dark world,0.08691135
and Garn is the galaxy,0.12575963
and dr.,0.04945572
strange that now Marvel is like let's go all out with magic and creatures and powers and all this stuff and thor ragnarok just fully embraces that and it's fun,0.15215908
i mean this is the kind of stuff that i would have loved to see more of in the other two movies because i feel like it was kind of holding back a little bit whereas now it's like BAM just put it all out there,0.09060558
you can definitely get a guardians of the galaxy vibe from this movie like it clearly watch that movie and when mm-hmm,0.072665446
that's what Thor needs to do guys,0.063644536
that's what the word he used to do,0.05966691
and a lot of it has to do with the direction tygo,0.08752079
ytt is an amazing director this movie handles a lot of different plots in subject matters,0.07039938
some more on a light-hearted comedic side and some on the darker dramatic side,0.15142006
and he found a way to take something like this with these different elements and still always make it feel like one movie but when it is funny oh my gosh - the movie is,0.08300587
hilarious,0.07548715
and again I want to point out the reason why I think it's it's funny good is because it's funny in the natural element of the story and the comedy came more from the characteristics of the characters in the movie,0.04189824
and what they were saying is their characters as opposed to like Marvel stand-up and we've seen Marvel's standup you know what I'm saying this one,0.10273757
I think they really fleshed out Thor better,0.06824935
they put a little bit more humor into him and they had him really showcased a little bit more than just being,0.11117285
I'm a god and I can fight things,0.25774124
Loki of course is up in this everyone loves Loki he's in top form as always but the whole Thor I hope dynamic of course Thor ends up in this tournament and he has to fight,0.10177387
the Hulk meanwhile Hulk is in this weird state where he can't change back to Bruce Banner and Thor has to kind of help him out with that the dynamic of those two almost are to feel like a buddy cop film we got to see a little bit more of Hope in this movie I still kind of wish that some of these elements could have led itself into a solo Hulk film but if this is what we got to do to get the Incredible Hulk more on-screen and to see more of him and establish that cared a little bit more,0.083572656
I thought,0.039424464
I did it in a really good way and we got ourselves a good Marvel villain,0.2496955
I really really like Cate Blanchett as hella in this,0.21320911
now warning,0.19247994
here's where some spoilers come in,0.08779615
so hella is this evil goddess and we find out that not only is she evil but she also happens to be related to Thor she's actually Thor's sister Odin's daughter her and Odin used to be back in the day just crazy warriors taking over other worlds just causing all kinds of damage and destruction as warriors,0.53490317
and then of course Odin was like well I got kids now so I can't do that no more we're done and hella still wants to do it,0.29435396
and oh it is all like none not only are we done,0.10896561
but since you still want to do it,0.05601892
I'm have to banish you you gotta go,0.5480486
and I gotta say man,0.122827634
I don't really like Odin took this movie for me to really go,0.239855
you know what oh it is kind of the big you know like,0.053087015
he said some nice things,0.068069376
the word Loki - have a love for,0.046925053
him because he's the father I get,0.11550464
it but he banished Thor in a moment Thor got cocky about being a warrior which is the past of Asgard in,0.4452358
itself,0.08425186
he adopted Loki but never told Loki the full story to where he always felt resentful of Thor because he was true Sun and Loki was adopted son,0.15450634
and now we got hella this daughter that was side by side and battling him,0.31089434
and then one day he just changed his mind and then gonna try to tell her she's wrong for doing what they were already doing before,0.26186737
it's like when you were smoker and you're a drinker and you stop and then you started point out other people would stop smoking this time dream like hey you,0.58264303
were there with me,0.055828206
Oh didn't you got,0.09397779
some issues man,0.17559847
it's another one,0.061450273
these complicated father relationships as Marvel Cinematic Universe if you're looking for the dramatic dark stuff in Thor Ragnarok it all comes from hell,0.31545684
she is not a jokester,0.24464759
she is not doing any one-liners her one mission is I am pissed off at Asgard I am pissed off and Odin I'm pissed off and Thor and everybody in my path got to die,0.6773239
and I mean that literally like for a movie that's got some wacky funny jokes in it,0.35108534
there's some straight-up like just mean death and like even with characters that you know like people that have been in the Thor storyline for a couple of movies,0.23700148
literally just walking on the screen to go hey what's that remember me sick don't even show up,0.27748606
she just disappeared she wasn't even in the movie but everybody else in that crew,0.21631311
you know that crude authorities hang out with,0.1096698
they are in this movie for like five seconds,0.10102039
hell is like yeah,0.46468362
you're right,0.058070842
now,0.031218953
yep,0.05336829
yep Callen just was a straight-up clean house of characters for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and then Karl Urban's there and he's all like don't kill me,0.2516398
she's like great will you the executioner,0.43610966
now I'm a command,0.087170385
here to kill other people he's like seriously,0.7068937
I just got here he just elbows gotta go into hiding,0.104090616
em dogs gotta like take off his big old crown and get away from the the open date there the mariokart road and just be like in the for somewhere,0.494353
like let me go wait I'm gonna stay,0.117618896
alive because black panels coming up in February honey,0.27705735
if you can't make myself get a cameo don't kill me hella as the worst aegis elbow impression by the way,0.3950129
thank you very much,0.05111566
but enough about hella oh my gosh uh Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie good,0.21632032
lord uh what can I say I love her I love everything about her the moment she walks on screen she is great she is strong,0.08275977
she is powerful,0.08917266
she is awesome,0.06397282
but she is also flawed because she is an alcoholic,0.7683549
very first scene that you see her is she's like what's up,0.1554071
I'm here to fight,0.24145553
yeah Wow,0.05593723
okay,0.050967906
that's an entrance,0.09812042
her character is just so amazing,0.063576266
and so cool when there's all these cool shots of her when she's walking,0.3270792
and like explosions are happening,0.114484094
when hotter like he's a freakin Power Ranger,0.7668948
she's just amazing man I just really liked her and then she has this incredible backstory about her and this army of women warriors you get this backstory or this is his flashback where heard a bunch of warriors of fighting hella and their own freaking flying unicorns and horses of whatever and helis throwing stuff in the air and it's all in slow motion,0.56164503
and it's got these different effects I'm telling you it feels like a Saturday morning cartoon with a budget and there's a whole point of the movie where I'm like I need that movie like entirety like I need more of that like can we just strip that out make a prequel film or sideways movie and give me that I'm telling that shot oh man that was,0.16446134
so cool,0.03968372
you know a lot of people always talk to rag on DC and stuff but I'm gonna say man,0.24223678
I feel like Marvin might've saw one woman,0.23827463
I was like,0.039237767
yeah we were gonna cut that scene,0.29553145
but I think now we're gonna leave it in you you're right tiger,0.08511206
look at this,0.054210015
let's hold on to that she's awesome she's just really I just I can't say enough about her she's just a really cool character one of the strongest female Marvel hero that we've seen in some time and again hopefully when she gets back on that ship again,0.15507011
she could take a trip to her condo just be like hey what's up,0.19277152
I brought him go with me to Falcon is riding shotgun war machine flew behind us Peter picked up sand data from spider-man homecoming we all here go boom it's all I say if you like go bloom you're gonna get some Goldblum in this gold boom is at full Goldblum in this movie it's Grandmaster right cuz,0.17729
I keep want to call him taskmaster for some reason,0.086624876
but it's Grandmaster,0.10147059
I also love that kind of turn a little bit in Jeff go boom when I try to explain that you hear me go uh a grandmaster if you know Jeff Goldblum and you know how Jeff Goldblum is and that's the Jeff Goldblum you want to see thor ragnarok deliveries but there's his new character Korg,0.09673552
I really liked him and I found out later that the director Tycho martyt was the voice of him,0.08006315
he was really funny too I really liked that character a lot he's trying to start this whole resistance and that leads into Thor wanting to start his own group of superheroes called lore Avengers,0.14208142
what I thought was really cute,0.07013493
and then even the ending of this movie man it was not what I was expecting you know I had a whole idea,0.1489903
what was gonna go down and then I was like oh okay,0.23792464
I mean you won but that was a surprise his movie is just full escapism at its finest,0.11028685
it's not trying to connect what it's saying in a movie two things are happening in the real world except for maybe a little subtle metaphor about immigration all the way down to a song called immigrations on this movie issues all about going in shutting off,0.10101379
the rest of the world being in this fantasy world seeing all the action seeing Thor fight scene Factory fight see and hope though crazy,0.38203537
seeing all these action and colors and and powers and all that kind of stuff this is a pure escape film and you know what there's nothing wrong,0.0693679
with that this feels like the types of movies that they were trying to make as action films back in the day but they just didn't have the budget or the story or no one cared enough to try to make it good like seriously,0.0545281
I want everybody that worked on Thor Ragnarok to now make a Masters of the Universe movie like if y'all could do he-man like you do,0.20140569
Thor I would be a happy happy person,0.0766722
and then get on Thundercats while you're at it,0.061296135
and SilverHawk to the finish of the trilogy,0.09265484
now for the bad like I said this movie is super super funny so funny though that sometimes the more dramatic stuff kinda doesn't have as much strength as it should it's really good stuff and an instrumenting stuff and what I do like about the movie is that when it does get into some of the more heavier stuff usually with hella,0.2399131
it does kind of stop the jokey jokes it really makes it clear this is bad and this needs to be stopped,0.16860716
but I think that in a movie that maybe wasn't as humorous that might have had a little bit more weight to it than it does in this movie the tournament stuff,0.1373824
it makes sense,0.050915394
why that super humorous and fun and action-packed because it's a tournament of Fighters,0.21062046
and it's the crazy world is and you got Jeff Goldblum what do you expect but the hell of stuff,0.558764
I think is something that's also very good too in a different way as much as I like it,0.06291821
and as good as it is in this movie in a weird way I kind of do wish it was a movie or a character that got established in earlier Thor movies and luckily like I said with the direction they were able to make it all seamlessly feel like the same movie but I feel like there's something they could have done more with hella,0.08161331
they really kind of introduced this whole storyline because her story is interesting and her reason for doing what she's doing is not,0.08464549
only these cases with a villain kinda has a point,0.1893189
I was doing something that I was told was okay and right for so long then all of a sudden I'm wrong and I'm banished,0.26006764
so therefore I got some vengeance to take out and I can respect that I mean I'm not saying I side with the villain I'm just saying that I kind of get where she's coming from a little bit,0.24150854
so to see her story kind of go from start to finish,0.2008341
in this movie you know I wished that she was like Loki where we would have met her early and we could have seen the progression of her and her vengeance or anger towards,0.15698306
Thor towards Odin along the way maybe there would have been a moment where Loki and hella kind of teamed up and worked together and then hella getting to a point where even look he was like I can't roll with that and that could have been interesting,0.12191975
you know for all that time we spent with them elves that we're never gonna see again and Thor the dark world that could have been a moment to be like hella could have been a part of that you know,0.24053496
that's what I'm saying,0.06048369
I think maybe,0.050416924
the second movie could introduce or has something to do with hella that could have culminated to this movie dealing with that as well as a tournament because I feel like that she was a great villain that we're now kind of done with maybe who knows you know Marvel will always find a way they need to bring her back,0.1519
but look like she's pretty done like,0.15515222
I said Schiff was nowhere to be found they don't even explain why she's gone and Jane Foster Natalie Portman dang talked about just give it up on something you had two movies where you made pretty much a large part of the movie about Thor pretty much leaving his life to be with this one woman that he loves so much,0.15284172
and the third movie that he's like,0.10869155
yeah they broke up and that's it,0.084616885
and it's not even for Mike lore or Loki,0.10039099
it's from like some fan some random person comes up the doors like oh you're Thor can I take a picture by the way sorry did your girlfriend broke up with you by I'm like that's it,0.23147209
that's how you Andale somebody's you forced me to watch you made me sit through that for two movies for the third movies go,0.24091543
yeah that's over why couldn't Ella meet her be like hey let's not Natalie Portman,0.13078755
yeah nothing that's wrong,0.09789283
that's nice wrong that I shouldn't want Jane Foster dead,0.24695067
that's a really terrible thing to say but it'd be pretty cool Dov you want it Helena get,0.15091924
Thor upset that'll be a way to do it I'm just trying to add a little bit more drama to your comedy where's kat dennings and now by the nerd,0.41229454
yeah God had that Stan Lee cameo,0.07816201
it's a good one,0.05668307
well we also get another cameo from another Marvel hero that you might remember I don't know,0.15123902
that's a Doctor Strange song or the guild theme song it was fun to see Doctor Strange and Loki kind of go head-to-head while in the battle Loki had to go grab something for,0.10998834
Thor,0.044869266
and he's notices that tesseract is still under there,0.07330311
and they don't ever show him taking the tesseract,0.10582445
but I think it's pretty safe to assume he took it you know you can't trust Loki how in three movies and the Avengers does Thor not realize stop trusting Loki,0.072978176
I know he's your brother but I got some family members and I love to but I don't keep my wallet and plain sight around them cuz,0.13776292
I know you get a funny after credit scene with Jeff Goldblum at the very very end,0.0778177
and you get a very interesting scene in the mid credits where Thor and Loki they've got a bunch of people in the ship everything is cool,0.08020033
and then this much much bigger ship just shows up and they don't show who's in that ship but I'm gonna have a good guess that probably involves a big purple being with a really cool blinged out gauntlet,0.051944453
I think the infinity war is about to begin,0.15098688
I do like the movie I really think it's fun in this movie being a little over hyped right,0.122532085
now maybe if you want to sense the best door yet I'm all about that I could believe that but best Marvel film I can't go that far,0.10573581
but overall,0.052775852
this is just a fun freakin film,0.5721199
so those are my thoughts on Thor Ragnarok,0.062641226
what did you think,0.0773198
if you saw the movie or do you plan on seeing the movie,0.07744889
