hey y'all welcome back,0.072107285
this is my review of Jun ho bongs 2019 film parasite,0.4032563
Joon ho bong is a South Korean director so this is definitely a foreign film subtitles everywhere and which I don't mind,0.17291044
I love foreign films and he is the director of okhta from 2017 magnificent animated movie there,0.08800544
and he also did snowpiercer with Chris Evans back in 2014,0.077996634
I think or 2013 that also is a great movie and parasite is more along the lines of snowpiercer and that it examines the disparity between rich people and poor people and what the poor people will do in order to get rich and what the rich people will do in order to stay rich,0.40057394
but it doesn't go,0.06671261
so far as to show that the levels in snowpiercer it mostly focuses on this poor family in South Korea and what they do in order to sort of get a leg up in society,0.13869098
they're poor in the way that it's kind of comical but kind of terrible at the same time because they live in a sort of like a basement of an apartment building their windows face the street,0.2463554
so we got them there,0.03664114
they're you know living quarters and then the street levels,0.17853849
right here,0.0585415
so they can see people walking around and they can see all the activity outside,0.06372592
and so when their windows are open all they get is noise from the street and everything,0.066508666
so there's not going on and I say they were so poor that their dad,0.3707253
he advises them to keep the windows open,0.10767058
so that when exterminators come around with you know their gas and they're shooting everything everywhere that some of that fumigation can go into their little apartment and then kill their bugs and that way they don't have to pay for the fumigation at all so kind of funny but still kind of terrible that you got to be in that situation,0.55530304
and it's that the movie was on that kind of a road for a good a good,0.0748722
50% of the movie was like that was really kind of funny watching them con this wealthier family and it was very good satire as to how a lot of poor people have to be like super-smart in order to survive basically so while it shows that a lot of poor people have to work extra hard at getting smart or or or becoming athletic or anything like that in order to get out of poverty,0.15168084
it also shows that once people get rich they kind of stop learning things,0.15079525
they're a bit more soft as far as as far as dealing with the world is concerned because they're more insulated along or along their own rich communities,0.2857617
you know they're not exposed to everything out there in the world,0.21619725
so it the movie does a really good job of showing those two those two different worlds really and how this family integrates itself into working for this rich family basically taken advantage of then they're conning them,0.21760044
and I loved how the the rich people aren't made to be the villains or the victims,0.3438818
and neither are the poor folks you know the poor folks that in this movie do what they got to do it's fraud,0.23980933
it's wrong but they do it right,0.110791
and the rich folks are completely unaware so what's going on with them,0.15052466
they're just kind of like falling for everything,0.12051352
but you're like,0.087925166
well are you stupid or you're just naive or or what is it you know,0.90174
and so when the movie took that left turn and went from a satirical dark comedy to basically a horror movie with very little gore,0.28289598
but still is very tension kind of shocking as to what happened I stopped rooting for the funny conman family you know and stopped feeling bad and then stopped feeling bad for the rich folks we're getting taken advantage of and I liked how the movie didn't let me say okay,0.31089434
these people are bad these people are good that's all there is to it,0.4894396
I like how it didn't do that everything was great funny at first and then kind of terrifying at the end and then kind of shocking at the near near the end credits but it's a it's a very well-done movie,0.07240882
I can't say that I wasn't I was looking forward to it,0.062400896
and I I wasn't in any way anticipating what was happening in the movie I couldn't call out anything,0.071005225
I wasn't alike,0.10591233
okay,0.050967906
well this is happening,0.060477316
so that that's gonna happen later I got everything wrong,0.17667235
I got everything wrong in this movie and I loved it I loved that I got everything wrong about it,0.14904308
and it's two families the rich family and poor family both mother-daughter father-son so it's four people to each family right,0.24080545
and so the rich family obviously they live in this huge house,0.18830153
you know gated security all kinds of crap,0.8785311
and I would explain the poor family's living situation,0.28518805
but I liked how both of their the character flaws are highlighted in this movie to show their downfall right because the the pork family their character flaws,0.1844565
they wind up really screwing them over later on at the end,0.6047274
of the movie which was I thought was brilliant because it wasn't something that I paid attention to and I would never have guessed it,0.06131254
but the character flaw just came back in a huge way at the end of the movie and completely ruined them,0.15433879
and then same thing with the rich family their character flaws,0.12025306
screwed them over kind of in a worse way you know towards the end of the movie and I really I really loved that like I said before when I reviewed Joker I hadn't seen this movie at the time but this has to be also one of the best movies I've seen all year long really is it really is I couldn't find it in the theater anywhere near me,0.35036454
so I did find the UH the illegal means online,0.0631242
so if it comes out on Netflix I don't know if it's still in theaters,0.10289114
but if it's on Netflix I highly recommend you check it out you watch it in the sense that it makes you think about the state of society nowadays and between the rich and the poor it's very much like Joker except that it focuses more on the wealth inequality,0.091244176
gap whereas Joker was mainly about mental illness but towards the end of the movie I was like wow this is practically like Joker in,0.21039848
so many ways,0.14821753
now that I see this ending,0.13490117
I was like okay that's that's kind of disturbing but it was good very good movie,0.14870554
I'd give it an 8 plus,0.09107205
so that's it,0.05862057
I don't want to give away anymore spoilers,0.10956226
I don't think I gave it away any spoilers but I don't want to give away too much about the movie it is funny,0.08980088
it's darkly funny it's very good dark humor in here it does become quite tense,0.059106674
when that movie makes that left turn turns it to like a horror suspense thriller thing the move the ending is fantastic the cast all do great work,0.124589145
it shot very very very nicely and man oh man that ending is twisted,0.4985139
so yeah if you see it you know joon-ho bong directed parasite anywhere come up in your feet or whatever Netflix whenever it's gonna come out there,0.4515347
I don't know how long it's gonna last in the theaters,0.15318055
I know it's already made 94.9 $94 and those already made 94 million dollars worldwide and it's a very small movie,0.060641423
so it's made a ton back in profit already,0.09928963
and I can see why it won the Golden Lion,0.09619728
I think I can see why I won first prize at one of these film festivals it's it's an amazing film it's really well done check it out if you want to get your mind twisted by some really dark humor or if you want to question a society and how things are divvied up between one group and another group and don't forget to Like and subscribe if you'd like to like and subscribe to things and I'll see you in the next video ciao,0.18022262
