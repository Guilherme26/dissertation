on with her character that you're just literally following her around and figuring stuff out,0.099101864
as the movie progresses the things that I liked about this love it was obviously,0.07238808
I had mentioned this in my trailer Thursday video for this movie the cinematography alone,0.10166082
is what made me want to see this movie it is so beautifully shot it's,0.31089434
in black and white so it's very unique and refreshing to see in a movie,0.07442171
like this I feel like the in last movie that I saw in black and,0.08575276
white that was even up for awards consideration was Nebraska that was also really good,0.10941145
and I also enjoyed the fact that it wasn't just a series movie it was,0.050548125
a serious movie in a sense of certain issues that were being brought up but,0.078360625
it was also slightly comical so it wasn't just this long drawn-out movie where we're,0.066375084
like okay it's in black and white there's just so much going on that you,0.17574224
feel like you have to pay attention to it it's so detailed but it is,0.088290475
exactly what goes on that makes it so light-hearted and like I said going through,0.07056902
the motions especially a scene in the third act really just brought me to tears,0.07221788
and it just made me so emotional to watch you know the progression of the,0.077078216
character and what this movie was all really about in the end but unfortunately the,0.0943993
things that I didn't really like about this movie was that some parts of the,0.059894536
movie were slow and it was expected because you know there wasn't any true like,0.06606722
musical score and some parts of it we're really boring to watch however I was,0.11372199
engrossed with the store and I really tried my best to really get into it,0.09053242
