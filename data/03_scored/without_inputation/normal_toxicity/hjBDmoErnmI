at a high security government facility finds a top secret mysterious creature who she is instantly inclined to,0.17352569
so i want to start off this review by saying that this is a request from trailer recuts and you guys should go check out their channel,0.18080434
it's really cool,0.05239944
and they have some really cool videos and thank you so much for the request,0.039680023
i was actually planning on rewatching this movie anyway and this was at a perfect time,0.08467283
and if any of you guys have any requests or any type of video you guys want to see on my channel make sure to leave them down in the comments in any of my videos because i'm always checking and looking for new ideas,0.24138398
but yeah let's talk about the shape of water,0.060458053
this is actually a movie that i saw once i finished watching the 2018 oscars i always watch them and every time a movie gets a lot of praise,0.062341735
i'm really interested in seeing what it was about especially when at that time i hadn't really watched as many movies as i do now i didn't really know what the shape of water was when i first saw it and to be honest,0.057048295
i didn't like it that much the first viewing i remember i saw it that same year 2018,0.06120862
i think i was like a sophomore in high school,0.09638533
i can't remember i didn't really like it as much,0.05366683
and i didn't understand its praise everybody was talking about it,0.10757698
and i didn't like it but i recently saw pan's labyrinth which is also a movie directed by guillermo del toro and he has amazing movies,0.08217618
you can tell he's very passionate about what he does,0.080238566
and he's amazing at production design and color and direction,0.05915951
but for me the story wasn't working the first time i saw it,0.06049721
and i'm really really happy to say that that has changed because i really really liked this movie i can't talk about this movie enough without mentioning the production design,0.11012651
it is so amazing,0.06140436
and this movie is very blue and greenish but it has some hints of that like mint green from the 60s and 50s and it is just a very beautiful color palette especially for this movie a lot of this movie is in the dark since sally,0.08225157
hawkins care is a cleaning lady working at night,0.25226563
most of it has to do at night,0.08455392
so there's a lot of really dark beautiful scenes that make it possible to have really beautiful lighting,0.09686535
and i think guillermo dodo used that to his advantage it was so beautiful there are so many beautiful scenes with alleyways and it's just like a beautiful looking film even this movie had a really bad plot which i used to think when i first saw it i have always loved the production design and it is such a beautiful looking movie also something that i love about this movie is that every single scene doesn't feel out of place everything feels like it flows correctly,0.13469473
it's not one of those movies where there is a random scene of violence or there's a random scene of this,0.14676796
and that like it feels like another director did it all of this you could tell that it's the same director because it has a very similar style,0.08257043
and i think that's really important when a director has a specific style because it makes the movie that much better,0.051403582
the acting of this movie is great,0.113873035
michael shannon is really scary in this movie and they they have this guy ripping his own fingers off,0.5154597
so he is clearly very menacing and every single time,0.20272395
he came on the screen i wanted to punch him in the face,0.91465795
so he's a very evil character,0.55887336
and his acting was great,0.113196716
he's always really good as well in everything that he does and you have octavia spencer she's kind of like her friend at work and is always trying to help her and i really liked her addition to the story and she's also always really great,0.07615389
there's richard jenkins and he's like really really nice,0.07804143
he's like one of the like the sweetest characters in the movie and i also really liked his performance can't believe i forgot to mention the creature dude,0.16009422
he also did really good,0.05816942
but the one that shines for me the most in this movie is sally hawkins and she's playing a mute lady,0.24610704
and she doesn't say many words,0.1133749
actually she doesn't speak at all in this movie,0.13540101
and she her performance just says so much,0.08594825
and that's so amazing because once you take away something like speaking which is a way of people you know talking about their emotions,0.12494724
it really really allows the movie to be way more interesting because it shows there's different ways of communicating that don't have to be with your voice,0.09213116
and this is just a very beautiful movie with very like outstanding acting,0.1063345
and i just loved her performance,0.07576616
she did so good and everything about her like she portrayed,0.16605823
so many emotions in a movie without ever saying one word,0.06737192
and i think that says a lot about her performance and i'm so happy that at least she got an oscar nomination because she very well deserved it,0.206585
and her character is obviously the essence of the story and i really like what they did with her especially that feeling of not feeling fulfilled with your life and feeling like something's missing that's a very relevant theme in life in general and obviously in this movie and i definitely really like what they did with that,0.07708339
and i also really enjoyed with the screenplay which is fantastic how they were able to take something that our main character is feeling but apply to,0.033804372
mostly all the characters actually that's not that i think of it all of the main characters in the story like every single person in this feels like they have to fill in some type of like void in the movie and they feel incomplete,0.09968136
and i think what the movie has to say about that is very interesting as well as human connection as well as just connection and that it doesn't just have to be human connections and the connection extends from just human to human,0.15158224
and i i thought that the messages of this movie were very beautiful and i'm really really happy that i rewatched it because when i first saw this when i was younger i didn't really it didn't click for me i was like okay this is just weird a weird looking alien dude with a girl,0.24217638
i didn't understand it,0.0761995
but it is so much more than than their connection which is of course very relevant in the movie it,0.07777321
and it's not just a love story,0.05149985
it's a lot more than that,0.057377625
and this movie has a lot of layers,0.098980986
and that's why i also think it is so amazing and it's it's just really awesome,0.059139155
i ca i don't even know how many other words to say about this because it's just you have to watch it and see because i think the messages portrayed in this movie are very important and relevant to a lot of people,0.1507355
and i think it's kind of ironic that such a strange looking movie with a strange plot that can not happen is very relevant and realistic to a lot of people which i think that's what makes a movie that much better than other movies honestly the one negative that i would have with this movie is that some scenes do make me feel weird and uncomfortable but that's just a personal preference,0.10080512
i'm not going to take too much away from the movie i mean that's what he wanted to do,0.0881599
i think this movie was very bold,0.24005774
and what it was trying to do which i really admire in a filmmaker and in a movie when movies are don't play it safe and this movie definitely didn't play it safe but just like that's like the one thing that's kind of weird sometimes i'm like you know but it's just like i still really enjoy this movie,0.08134972
and i'm going to give this movie an a one of the most original movies i've ever seen he never fails to make an original movie and his style really really shines and i'm pumped,0.15392293
i just want to see all his movies now which maybe maybe i should do that you know since i finished watching all the christopher nolan movies maybe i should watch all of his and make that a series,0.17680739
i think that that would be very fun,0.06658316
thank you guys so much for watching,0.039207336

and thank you again to trailer recuts for leaving this suggestion i loved rewatching it and i'm very happy that i did because i love changing opinions about movies and i think that should be very normalized in the film community you could hate a movie and then suddenly love it,0.11564629
