supreme with the Sam Raimi spider-man - that might be a nostalgia that might change because the reality is this film has so much rewatch ability has so many different Easter days but that's not even the best thing about,0.10342817
it I mean the visual immersion part of this film is unlike,0.13334486
anything I've ever seen before I think that shout out to graze ran off from making a great reference to paper that was made by,0.10142675
Pixar it was the perfect blend of 2d,0.11329167
stylize and then 3d animation because that is what this is on steroids because what this is is you taking like a tumble strip and you go through and I'm sitting there like reading pop-ups and reading this and any kind of blurs and they think this merges that was so many loves there's something moments where I was like,0.21168937
it's a 3d image,0.07091815
this is a focused image like but it is so visceral is so in your face is so amazing,0.36409545
no pun intended but they get every tear to write the character models were perfect because the thing is I am also a comic book collector suffice to say that I'm a spider-man fan is the understatement man is my second favorite superhero of all time number one is Batman,0.07223912

spider-man,0.21480738
I on Mt version swagman the original one John semper for the 1990s and like I love the character and the richness of it,0.047701657

and what this move was able to do they get the characters perfect,0.05655253
if you know the comics you're gonna be like looking it's like,0.08659541
this is the character,0.061842956
I've always wanted to see and they get it to a tee,0.059241768
and now the biggest thing about this for me from the not just a visual standpoint,0.06411968
but from an emergency point they have to get spider-man right Peter Parker spider-man and they have to get mild around spider-man right,0.15290138
now Peter Parker pick it perfect because the two different purchases I want I don't want splicing much,0.0989253
let's just say that they get him one,0.088152334
did you see from the trailers and just like what he kind of goes looking on old and ragged like his Baxter's for the interesting the backstory of the villains in this is really interesting,0.12195185
the surprises of the villains in this are very interesting and every single one of the characters has their moment interesting one to get some of them kind of Whittle in here there but they are utilized perfectly to the point that Enid they've gotta have their own spin-off any of them could go in a weave with each other at Owens,0.09601757
how they have created,0.067214854
this is how you make a multiverse or a universe a cinematic universe in one movie they succeeded but miles Brown shout out to man,0.10777194
Ryan Ryan Jason Reynolds dressing room has made a book a novel called Miles Morales spider-man and I recommend you go and check that out because when you read that we through the pages and you start watching the character dynamics between mouse's parents from my house and his world and you know how he gets to the school days then he what kind of person that he is you know his inadequacy complex,0.13786517
like the things that he loves to do like things with his uncle,0.15446779

because again the visual effects for these are amazing but even more so the soundtrack and the score are equally amazing like there's so many different suppose I'm like how did you get the rights to this song like how like how did you get this great production of a soundtrack to go through so smoothly then it goes and just translates off the beat,0.09433825
there's even one mom in the vent opening that I thought was to live,0.13361795
it was straight up like a baby driving moments to me when I'm sitting there watching miles do something when he was in his room and I was like this is this is character development in like raw form,0.10459783
and I was like this is just great like from cinematic from a cemetery standpoint,0.085866906
it is great visual immersion but it's also it's same that time interweaving with music and with the characters the last thing that I wanted to really bring up is the writing is great like,0.05039533
I mean bin Dez created Miles Morales of course dico and Lee had a beat back product or what spider-man is in it takes from all those elements and just make something so rich and in visceral that you're like if you're spider-man fan if you're a spider-gwen fan or a Ghost Rider fan if you're that's fundamental war fan,0.28662208
