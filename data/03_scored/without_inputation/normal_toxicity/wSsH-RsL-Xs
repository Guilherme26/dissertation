hi I'm Andre and I'm a black nerd nice to see you again on my channel and a special shout-out to my subscribers you asked me to review the movie get out which I actually saw a couple weeks ago they had a special influencer screening but it was really cool,0.40310544
the cast was there Jordan Peele key and Peele Fame who wrote and directed this movie was their chance the rapper was hosting the Q&A so that's different that's pretty cool,0.03263473
but yeah it was a little cool event and it was nice to see the people whatever but it's all about the movie right,0.08974029
I saw the movie I got to talk about it right,0.091954246
now to you let's talk about this movie,0.1271755
here's the thing about this review those be a little bit different than what I usually do,0.09517256
usually I'm like here's good bad very and here's some clips and here's some plot point if any other mm-hmm I don't do any of that I won't going to keep this as as big and simplified while still giving you my thoughts,0.13225767
and what I possibly can,0.05532647
and the reason for that is I don't want to spoil this in any kind of way,0.09634787
I think this is one of those movies that you got to go in knowing probably as little as you possibly can to really fully experience and enjoy it,0.15047786
so this is it this photo you see back here that's all I get all right,0.11278191
I'll put the the logo of the title of the movie boom get out,0.09596011
that's it only thing,0.0808919
you need to know about the plot is that there's a couple Chris Andros Chris happens to be black Rose happens to be white they're going home to the countryside to our Paris house to meet her family obviously her family is white,0.40210116
he's is black guy in a different location with all these family members and something's happens,0.5334604
some of its suspenseful some of its horror some of his race-related,0.3124429
so it is a blend of all of it but that's all you need to know,0.12027784
so uh yeah man,0.18730596
I really enjoyed this movie I am NOT a huge horror person like,0.31089434
I don't really go see a lot of horror movies in theaters and lately some of the horror films have kind of followed a similar formula that just come in to go,0.104150586
and so it was nice to go see this one and really get into it,0.08196875
and what's interesting about this movie is it's or suspense then hearth,0.14898941
it reminds me a lot of 10 Cloverfield Lane not necessarily in the actual premise but just in the feeling of it which with another movie that was much more enjoyable,0.0339537
not knowing anything going into it,0.05934447
as opposed to being told a lot about it before going in I saw 10 Cloverfield Lane like the weekend it open mainly because I didn't want anything spoiled about it,0.098299384
and really enjoyed it as a result and the same way,0.05955211
I feel about this one but as far as there are similarities as far as feelings,0.07278358
yeah man that that feeling of just suspense of like everyone's acting normal but they're a little off,0.31089434
and I know that there's something underneath that's going down,0.083114035
but I can't figure out what yet the movie is not coming yet,0.05613625
but I know everything,0.047837418
ain't right or when someone goes from one move to another move really quickly for whatever reason like this gave me some flashbacks of watching 10 Cloverfield Lane and just how the suspense was with this movie the whole time I watch this movie I'm just like this like usually when you're watching a movie and you like having fun like a Lego Batman or a comedy or something that you can like sit back,0.09343799
you,0.10154687
lean back get Sharleen back gets popcorn you just like rule is I'm having a great time movie time just relaxing,0.11059402
you know if you don't have anybody in those in the seat in front of you you might even get a little like home body,0.17793913
and I ain't got no manners to speed up,0.10814712
you know how it is,0.060410738
but what this movie man I was like this the whole time like and air any sound like not even like jump jump scare type sound like just you know up walk like you hear like a twig getting cut from someone's foot touching the ground I'm like what that was that wasn't what's going on that's kind of how I felt watching this things about this is so suspenseful and it's just one of those movies where you're just like you don't know what's going to happen,0.36831322
or how people are going to act in this and and it's just the tension is just so deep,0.076235406
and I felt that the entire time watching this thing,0.0625423
so that's one thing you're reminding me live how I felt when I was watching 10 Cloverfield Lane like man John Goodman is helping me a little winters it out but at the same time King y'all there I got a got to live off this like this family they seem cool then you know the making food and everything seemed right was hell me right,0.24181525
I know something right,0.06668494
and then when you start meeting the people that's helping them network at the place and you know and of course like that's what a report comes in cuz,0.060192928
they're all black you just like something about them either,0.604787
you know this dude going in here and either like a really black people working here I think I could be cool with it but then you meet them you Amy they were everyone weird why oh man isn't it um,0.5668118
so I really like that bad,0.2397587
I really really appreciated that that style of suspense with this movie you just don't know what's going on but you know something they are right,0.110756665
and then what adds the extra element to that is the stuff about race,0.11696885
now I'm guessing that this may be the type of movie that is going to work for different people in different ways depending on what your background is,0.0506541
so I can only explain it for myself,0.11562369
but as a black man particularly one who has been in situations at times where I've been surrounded by all white people on their element in this movie that I kind of relate it to a couple of times I was like I know this is fictional,0.46531773
and I know this is a suspense and I know that there is something extra to this movie that has nothing to do with with real life,0.09833007
because it's a fantasy you know situation,0.15562293
but the thing that's happening,0.05926095
here,0.053441156
I can relate that to actual things that happened to me I realized there's a without,0.04778111
giving away too much,0.12339495
there's a party scene that happens in this movie and it's very much related to the movie but I have been to a bit,0.08908103
I have been to parties and I have been in conversations particularly in LA that I was like I know that situation,0.05720013
I've been there,0.032005034
I can literally like take myself out of my seat take myself in the movie theater and go,0.16800782
I have been in that situation are you are you focusing on some pleasures,0.15293376
my cameras aren't focusing on on the screen as opposed to on me not this black faces black face cameras make a decision anyway,0.44134447
so yeah Matt you you you can't help but notice at least for me I couldn't I hope but add that extra tension to the movie so you've already got the suspenseful stuff going on and then you add the tension of race on top of that and it's not even so much blatant stuff,0.23674738
it's just just situation,0.052895673
it's just the situation,0.0529033
and that's why I was saying,0.05762768
I think it's going to work different for different people because it was a situation that I could relate to based on my life experience and based on experiences of others I know who've been in some situations it's like I I could just feel an extra level of attention that I don't know other people will feel but I felt it,0.05729077
I felt about the entire movie man and it was it was intense man,0.1580216
the other reason why I would compare this movie to 10 Cloverfield Lane is because like that movie there's a lot of times you're going to want to pay close attention,0.10762331
to just everything in the movie you want to pay attention to things,0.113964505
people say things people do certain lines of dialogue certain objects certain things you just want to keep tabs because there's going to be things you know what was that all about,0.10142182
and then when that all the pieces start getting put in the place you be like,0.1123143
oh now I see why this person said this or this person did that it's like it,0.12863544
will all sort of come together gets all scooby-doo mystery on you like God says Velma comes out and says I mean the reason why this thing happened is because of this and now you understand jinkies you know I get it get to that moment um so that that's really cool too because I think it's going to be one of those types of films where if you watch it the first time I only watched it once but I feel like if I were watching a second time there were things that probably just kind of look like oh that's the thing but I'm now watching and go,0.11249174
oh okay I see what you did there Jordan,0.083010815
Peele,0.065581806
you crappy dude,0.86209285
so uh so that that's that's really neat um,0.10256162
you know are there any issues with the movie you know it it after a while you start to start put the pieces together yourself it starts to get a little predictable,0.16603908
it isn't Blum House production,0.06873162
so some of the element are Blum house II,0.05195938
but at the same time I know that Blum house kind of had this period of just trying to make every movie cheap and like paranormal activity or whatever but you can tell that you know even though this is a bottle film it only takes place in a couple locations,0.113701224
you can tell that there was definitely some work into how it shot into the performances the performances are great,0.1821738
everyone plays it on this subtle level to where you again you're like questioning like wait are you saying this because that's just how you are as a person or are you saying this because there's something going on that,0.15090871
I'm not noticing here,0.13629404
so like they're really good at that the music is always this kind of like violin sounding or just kind of creepy sounding that makes things more intense it shot beautifully,0.2423572
it's performed great a lot of people play it very subtle,0.079038136
there are a couple of characters that are a little bit more so not so subtle,0.16730474
uh but that's okay because they either makes them really creepy or really hilarious so either way you're fine there's an actor in here in a little realm,0.16568947
he's a comedian and he's great,0.17819862
he basically without again without saying too much,0.09914626
but but if you are a person that constantly goes to horror movie then you're one of the people who's like why are you doing,0.15549023
this,0.05212481
why you doing that don't go in there don't do that,0.08827966
that's basically his character in this movie ah you can kind of relate to his character in that same kind of way so so yeah man oh man it I just I really really like this movie I just very much enjoyed it,0.07018122
and I think it's very interesting to see a horror slash suspense film use the subject of race as a way to add more horror add more suspense to something that is fictionalized,0.16346133
but yet you can still connect it to things in life which that's how it is with pretty much any drama you look at like sci-fi or even comedies or action,0.114506826
even though it's a fictionalized fantasy version of what's going on the screen you can always kind of relate it related to real world things,0.08017757
and that's what happens with this,0.0694423
I mean I don't think it's a preachy movie I think it's just a movie that uses a subject of race who is advantage to tell a story,0.1583894
so if anyone's going is going was it is it Reese's,0.039007116
I don't know no you know,0.1572889
what grow a pair,0.17018409
I'm sorry it's all right boohoo a movie about suspension car use the subject of race to help get mrs.,0.101661496
Benson car,0.05288871
oh man went away,0.19593799
you know like deal,0.072887756
with it okay because that's what the movie is,0.062462386
and that's what made,0.0504413
it intriguing to me,0.06797221
when I first saw that trailer for I was like I got to see that you know I didn't do a reaction video because I wasn't really doing reactions of trailers at the time but mark my words when it came out at this time period I would have done but anyway uh yeah man,0.10820107
I knew for a fact that I want to see what was going on here,0.069439635
and now thing I really think it's really good and particularly for it coming from Jordan Peele who is a person that you know is known for comedy known for key and Peele and bad TV and sketch comedy and things like that to see him on the other side being a writer being a director I mean obviously he had a lot of great work doing this in comedy like cameo you know I was thinking they were writing the sketches everything but to see him take that talent into another genre was really cool,0.10005683
and I thought was very effective,0.051563375
I mean you know I I just I really was intrigued by this movie and that's really all,0.09638066
I want to say about it,0.10175232
I'm not going in any more detail more than that all I'm saying is if you like horror films if you like suspense film and you are whipping a be about race being mentioned in the movie then get out for you for the schedule Barry okay two kids see Batman and speak on over to the other theater and seek it out uh yeah man I just I like this movie I really really enjoyed it like I saw this screening but I actually want to go see it again,0.19503838
I'm going to Newark on this weekend,0.1497927
so I don't if I get to see it again,0.073566094
this weekend but I do want to see it again,0.066686854
that's a phone get out,0.08310092
I want to see the movie again just because I'd be intrigued to see if I catch anything the second time around I'm watching it again,0.0771105
so there you go that's not fun,0.10534543
this,0.05212481
