yeah hey what's going on out of the YouTube this is SCO 0 pick to,0.06522192
0 representing JVs so this is gonna be my review for a movie that I've,0.059547905
been long overdue of watching and I'm talking about the movie Lady Bird coming-of-age story,0.071164005
this was directed by Greta gierek starring I'm gonna get her name so wrong I,0.06116031
apologize but sorry so Ross Ronan Laurie Metcalf um Lucas hedges and Timothy Shaw met,0.059682272
the ironic thing about all four do you feel that just listed either last year,0.014101228
or this year they're not made for Academy Award Timothy are Sarma is nominated for,0.025995377
the movie with Armie Hammer even though he was in this movie Lucas hedges for,0.07334249
Manchester by to see who did amazing in that and then you got Laurie and,0.031650104
this is Ronan that are nominated for Lady Bird and I gotta say their relationship,0.053223338
is so real like what I mean by that is the organic nosov how they,0.035999075
function and thrive as a mother and a daughter is something that I can sit,0.0736917
there and be like I've seen this before this seems real it's not like okay,0.074616976
we're gonna like have this Hollywood moment where this thing happens or like okay this,0.034391325
person is gonna get this epiphany and they change like I think one of the,0.05313753
most literal amazing scenes is when Lady Bird and her mom are legit going and,0.16755643
trying on dresses and Lady Bird goes trial on his pink dress she likes it,0.16379282
and her mom the first thing because our mom is like something kind of sitting,0.22365268
like is it too pink and Lady Prairie responds back why can't you just be,0.05583219
okay with it why can't you just like me and then she goes back and,0.059688926
even reiterates with it's like why don't you like me and I mean I think,0.13718349
that the movie Fitz's hit home with me son kind of the same way as,0.07861938
this one because this is for me was something that I'm I come from the,0.03389044
south I come from you know certain circumstances where I'm like man I this is,0.04597816
real these kind of conversations are seemingly real even though it's coming from a play,0.027140157
like I can see and relate to this conversation and even with these two people,0.022483872
these two amazing actresses they're able to convey something to me that I was like,0.032613955
mate because one of the things that Laurie the mom says early on and move,0.051653504
on I've know I'm kind of spoiling a little bit I apologize you should definitely,0.108996995
go check this movie out but I think that even if you see it in,0.040796377
the trailers I don't think you're gonna lose anything as far as weight behind it,0.07438482
um one of the things that she talks to her about when Lady Bird gets,0.06130532
upset with her is that she was my lady pros like you know haven't you,0.13538216
ever just wanted to do this and do this as a kid like and not,0.06360087
complaining about this and like she was like my mom was an abuser and an,0.31798536
alcoholic and it was like yo like and that that defines her character if you,0.0746489
don't catch this little moment everything up she does you won't pick up on you,0.048479248
won't pick up that cheese very much so a perfectionist like analytical critical highly over-critical,0.023064578
can't even really enjoy herself because she not just critical of you know labor but,0.048941553
of herself and what she does and ironic thing is that she interacts with people,0.07145536
and helps people throughout their problems like literally that's what she does you know saying,0.04621563
I'm just a nurse but she really helps people without their problems but yet she,0.051879004
does that to try to project because she's got this internal turmoil within herself and,0.029917965
and even like later on her dad even says to the baby bird like look,0.15837955
your mom loves you but your mom can't even get out from this one specific,0.41532812
situation to try to help she doesn't know how to help you net that hurts,0.05602443
her on the inside and I was like that's crazy but then the character Lady,0.14007902
Bird is even more conflicting because she's not good at anything it's like he's not,0.138746
just like you know how I got these like superstar characters you know like alright,0.026499586
this person is gonna have this one trait it's good Act she's gonna be good,0.124339454
at writing but she's gonna be good at you know organizational skills so you gonna,0.07860275
have the same as that Kings and her mom have she any of those things,0.095254965
and what happens is because her mom is not able to reflect and let her,0.22796625
know like you are great I like you everything's good so she she touched her,0.21303238
dad but you know it's always that mother-daughter thing that shows like where you are,0.14105552
going as a woman and so for her she's a pathological liar because she has,0.41271612
to try to appease to feel at place and that sounds crazy but her friend,0.10666486
I was her friend's name oh my gosh Julie paid by a beanie Feldstein I,0.093168944
would have actually liked a little bit more of her but I like the way,0.10271234
they just kind of like ran it off they didn't give me too much because,0.043095917
that's not about you know the story has over art either way when her and,0.017679252
Julie were conversating and stuff like that like it was like it seems so organic,0.09501018
it seemed so natural but eventually she just decides the desert Julie and I go,0.040164452
and meet up with this cool girl because she wants to hang out with this,0.3665456
cool guy and then it's like expectation expectation and it's not even like peer pressure,0.0756254
it's like you need to feel like you're at place and part of that is,0.045871064
because it reflects on who she sees in herself like even when she goes and,0.06284988
like goes into the the teachers location takes the grades those enjoy sound like like,0.027054349
this is who I am and it's like yo like she has no characteristics about,0.14850025
her that makes her exceptional other than the fact that she is a realist when,0.03407137
it comes down to it like an eventual point she's like alright yeah I was,0.09904518
a pathological liar like look this is this where it is but she's really just,0.30839598
figuring out that's why I mix it so well done as a story that's a,0.034326803
coming-of-age story my legit like when I got done looking at the movie those one,0.11527167
moment towards the end where Julie's mom like shuts her out you know I'm saying,0.16759968
and like Julie leaves I'm not Julie but um Lady Bird leaves and she goes,0.056252584
a circle in the car right and like that performance was oh lazy because she,0.19726819
conveyed so many emotions and she kept it in and I was this like because,0.025994712
we have seen like the parallel between the beginning of the stories like them two,0.017279476
together in the car and you know their their body hit these proximate because they're,0.22768883
already clashing but you know they love each other but he can't really talk about,0.032123048
it and like the beginning you don't say lady breathless I'm crazy I don't wanna,0.09779929
spoil it but when the mom is by her stuff and leaving she's like in,0.057483174
her heart I can feel like there goes my best friend daily goes my daughter,0.10622783
there goes the person I need to protect and I can't help you know I'm,0.031056095
saying like I was I feel uneasy motion Dan later bird later on she goes,0.07219039
to this church when she gets through what she needs to be and she leaves,0.14861067
it has this conversation it's like like I'm feeling all these kind of things I'm,0.05525215
like yo I'm sitting there I go back and recount to myself and that news,0.060632154
is telling a little bit about myself I don't want I normally don't do this,0.04377374
but this movie provokes testimony in my personal opinion because you know saying when I,0.05496878
think about high school like when I went to prom for my high school I,0.085001156
didn't go with anybody I got you know invited was somebody I didn't want to,0.021457493
go with and then you know I went but I met up with the person,0.024427539
that I wanted to dance with but we didn't leave together a legit left my,0.024456142
prom and I went to the waterfront and just you know children listened to music,0.038425665
because my family situation it wasn't so much about like when I went to prom,0.062205978
like alright well it's gonna be this you're gonna have this little did I it,0.06263569
was it was a totally different family dynamic so for me to go out and,0.033026367
go to the water park what would a front and be in my car and,0.029376505
listen to music chillin like I was like I embraced that so I said they're,0.05837319
almost like I'm connected to this moment with Julie and Lady Bird I was like,0.049602743
me and I love this like when you know Lady Bird is have this conversation,0.11439296
with her mom back and forth like I can relate to these kind of conversations,0.12624787
because this is real this is like even like when she went and go away,0.13274139
to college like when I went to college you know I'm saying and I was,0.01943467
kind of just like taken back when she had this conversation I was talking to,0.048086792
her dad over the phone talking about like she's rich I talked to her mom,0.17388499
and she's talking about like her hometown and how long she drove in it for,0.053933755
the first time it was different than when she walked around they don't when her,0.047130257
mom drove away it was like she they were to set and feel all the,0.055921324
beauty and she couldn't really accept all of it until later on and I'm getting,0.056803357
to a point here but for me like I remember going to college and like,0.015403657
you know I was like man there are some beautiful things in my small town,0.0777021
that I'll miss you know saying I didn't accept it until much later you know,0.024065014
saying even now like I'm not you know it's different like it was moments like,0.025798483
I always remember and they they take part of who I am because one of,0.019608948
the biggest critical things about the the movie to me was that Lady Bird tried,0.065921694
to say I need to get away from home you know I want to be,0.120917745
this I want to be better than this person I want to be the center,0.09951879
of attention but she had no idea you know who she really is she wasn't,0.02760379
good at anything and on top of that like she alienated everybody because of her,0.11386214
pathological lying you know about everything you know I'm saying like it was like she,0.19444782
had her friend Julie and she shut her out you know she had other friends,0.16416866
but they weren't really friends there was even a moment where yo oh boy Lukas,0.090672515
huge Lukas hedges has interesting relationship with her that whole relationship would bit off of,0.11900202
a line foundation you know and then like the crazy thing I'll say that I,0.034358066
think that her mom in her do have in common I think is an asset,0.17495926
which is actually something good about Lady Bird that she probably gets from her mom,0.13264161
is that after the fact of being able to forgive I think that forgiveness is,0.011158456
something that Lady Bird can definitely be able to do as much as she bickered,0.11052359
and you know act it out did all these kind of things like the relationship,0.07307042
between Danny and Lady Bird is to me a testament of her able to forgive,0.040600814
her being able to late because the any situation that's real you don't say like,0.031897552
you never would know you know but it happened and when he broke down on,0.067873344
her I was like oh that's crazy you know and it just it feels real,0.11292889
and for me to be able to rant about this it's almost like you know,0.07376953
I took a I took a I took a detour into Sacramento California chilled and,0.031556312
just kind of like went with a camera crew and just walked around with like,0.036658272
these characters for a while and just watch their lives like the jimin in the,0.057356127
2005 the music selections like the the dress the way people dressed and the way,0.046936687
things were and even like from a Catholic school standpoint I mean I don't wanna,0.14381337
go too much into that but it's very much so accurate in my personal opinion,0.062076267
so as a film and that was able to convey how they act I can,0.019964822
see why this was definitely rated one of the highest movies this year this gave,0.02803882
me the same as X feeling that me myself me me Earl and the dying,0.1709981
girl gave me emotionally as much as a coming-of-age story that you know I think,0.24279767
it's just this is an interesting Testament it's like it was to me it was,0.06163126
definitely better than manhood because her boyhood because it felt so organically real not just,0.24681117
from the standpoint of time but from what things were happening so I mean I,0.024875874
don't know what to give this a rating I don't want to just give it,0.038981758
a 10 just to say us a 10 but it can't be anything long it,0.03409066
is I'm gonna give it a range how about that nine to ten a nine,0.052627336
to attend is where this was stand I don't know I feel like over time,0.026504908
if I said yeah I looked at this on my wife she would love it,0.10650654
we would probably bring it up to a ten if I looked at this over,0.025665445
time of myself like a foggy night for five where my Steven at nine but,0.07716596
as a movie it is very good it is very well acted is very organic,0.04773491
it's very natural and I think it's very interesting that I would wait tonight which,0.05726965
is the night the sudden fit Daniel in lobes to watch this film because for,0.050149526
sure man the mom could easily get nominated for me and as well as oh,0.06321772
girl Ronan she could get nominated as well or not nominee they could both win,0.13854046
but either way I hope y'all enjoyed this review keep the lock jbi swingin on,0.096977785
