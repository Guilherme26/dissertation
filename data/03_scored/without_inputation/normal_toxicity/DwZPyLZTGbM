so this is probably the most hyped movie this year when it comes to the award season,0.06680848
but from the first moment I heard about it it seemed boring to me that was pretty much my initial reaction to it,0.09855244
oh this looks boring and that's just me being honest here,0.29536647
and it doesn't really matter to me how much hype or praise the movie gets if it doesn't appeal to me on a gut level I'm not gonna be that excited to watch it that being said there's still a pretty good chance,0.087554745
I like it,0.076225646
when I do sit down and watch it and I fully expected to be proven wrong,0.12576069
here I expected to end up liking it,0.07749848
well you can probably tell where this is going,0.061392087
yeah,0.040847696
I didn't like it,0.076315805
and I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it about five minutes into it,0.11182073
because the title sequence sets the tone for this thing pretty much perfectly,0.08660306
if you like the title sequence you'll love this movie and I definitely didn't I mean during the first scene after the titles,0.063944615
I just went oh for sake because at that point I knew exactly what I was in for,0.053304575
and I just had no interest,0.09502693
so what's the deal,0.07340182
here,0.053441156
it's a black-and-white movie by Alfonso Cuaron said in Mexico in the 70s the same guy who made children of men and gravity the first one is great the other one visually stunning but story-wise kind of meh but this one's a bit different this one is about a maid who lives with this wealthier family and she seems kinda like a part of the family actually they treat her very well and the kids well her and it's almost as much about the family itself as it is about her except the stories told entirely through her and the movie follows her and I mean I have nothing against the core story here or the characters or how its shot or any of that Quarren knows what he's doing it's more about the pacing and how it's put together and presented,0.17684078
this thing moves at a glacial pace,0.10996206
and the thing is there's nothing complex going on here,0.09703245
it's a very straightforward story,0.04965778
this is a 90-minute movie if I ever saw one but it's actually 2 hours 15 minutes,0.057900667
I mean I could tell you everything important that happens in this movie in about two sentences,0.1337618
now,0.03121897
I'm obviously not gonna do that there's some new ones there but it's essentially a movie about changes challenges and moving on,0.050066225
and my main issue was that I just didn't care about anything that was going on not necessarily because the stuff itself wasn't compelling,0.065568015
but because of the way it was presented the presentation board the living out of me,0.11799729
and I love dramas,0.08871782
I don't mind a swell movie and I don't mind long movies either but the pacing needs to be good and it needs to be either really interesting or really entertaining,0.08726832
and this just wasn't I mean I just reviewed the house that Jack built which is longer than this and it's a slow burn too but I liked it because for the most of it it was either interesting or entertaining and to me this wasn't however that last act the last 45 minutes or so I didn't hate I actually kind of liked it,0.07228868
at least,0.08127203
I liked some aspects of it because it felt like an actual movie it had some momentum it moved,0.10980769
forward,0.03346383
things happened I even got a bit invested in what was going on unfortunately the first hour and a half didn't have that and I can't remember being so utterly bored by a movie in a long time and in the interest of being completely,0.061225597
transparent here I seriously considered shutting it off and I told myself no one knows you're gonna review this,0.16645195
no one cares just shut it off and this misery now but I stuck with it and well I don't know if it was worth it,0.5154597
but at least it got better,0.052479394
so there's that,0.05213398
and now I'm sitting here trying not to be too harsh because this thing obviously struck a chord with people but the bottom line is I thought this thing was incredibly boring for most of the runtime and that's just the truth,0.1544315
and that's just my opinion,0.056090996
so take that for what it's worth but it also means,0.09024881
I don't see how I could possibly recommend it,0.15003647
so maybe skip it maybe don't make up your own mind,0.1927855
I'm not your dad,0.24004465
you,0.10154687
