so last week the Irishman the latest film from Martin Scorsese dropped on Netflix with,0.06702104
the holidays and my birthday it took me a few days to find a block,0.09839292
of time where I could watch the entire thing but I finally completed the irishman,0.08298672
challenge so let's talk about it the Irishman tells the epic story of Frank Sheeran's,0.07119597
time is a mafia hitman spanning multiple decades so prior to this films released there's,0.3741294
been a lot of talk about what is true cinema the MCU all sparked by,0.06803584
comments from Martin Scorsese but now we have the movie itself and we can evaluate,0.07833139
it on its own terms so before I give my thoughts on it go and,0.09986278
tell me what did you think down below in the comment section did you love,0.1757748
it is it one of the best of the year is this true cinema we,0.029347574
a little bit disappointed was it too long all of that fun stuff let me,0.20170312
know your take also let me know if you happen to have been able to,0.097249836
see it in the theater only got a limited theatrical release for a Scorsese film,0.15130045
this is the kind of film you really do kind of want to see in,0.12992711
the theater let me know if you were able to do that down below in,0.3039949
the comment section with that said let's get started talking about the good in the,0.04426699
first thing you have to talk about with this movie is of course the fantastic,0.09980847
performances from our three leads you've got three Hollywood icons essentially returning to the genre,0.05385302
that puts them on the map as Hollywood icons in the case of Joe Pesci,0.09967278
he's essentially been retired for something like 20 years and has been telling people no,0.09469049
for decades and finally this is the movie that he decided to return for Martin,0.05077468
Scorsese for this specific project and he absolutely brings his a-game and you kind of,0.10655515
remind you how good he really is like in my household I've got two kids,0.22649175
I got three kids under the age of 10 and so we watch home alone,0.11094037
all the time and then I watch the Lethal Weapon movies all the time that's,0.23039791
what I see a lot more of than some of his more gangster kind of,0.5154597
an actual award-winning stuff and kind of just remind you how excellent of an actor,0.11959705
he really is in the big stuff in the subtle moment he can do it,0.061459523
all but he's been out of the spotlight for a very long time the other,0.09829303
two kind of leads here with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino these are guys,0.06407781
that of course we know their a-game is the best there is but for whatever,0.09239979
reason a lot of the roles that they've gotten over the last 20 years have,0.029250152
been a little bit questioned allah some times they've been comedic stuff that you just,0.31373513
seems a little bit embarrassing why are they doing some of this stuff he wondering,0.24167052
like did they lose it a little bit if they kind of lost theirs no,0.10341408
no no they just didn't happen to get the right roles as soon as they're,0.08615766
working with Scorsese again I mean they are just kind of fantastic in convincing you,0.14980434
that they are like turning into these people it's very like with you know Al,0.12262092
Pacino is showing up in Adam Sandler copies and stuff like they kind of forget,0.15188982
in some of the other stuff he's even kind of done over the last 20,0.094625995
years it just seems like he's doing his Pacino isms whereas here it gets back,0.10647059
into acting and transforming into the jimmy hoffa in this film and you buy him,0.18932073
as the charismatic leader guy that's rallying all these people that behind-the-scenes really believes he's,0.19419496
doing the right thing even though he's very much doing evil things and through some,0.30351135
of the stuff that he's doing the pride all of it because also Robert Robert,0.05460672
DeNiro as well here similar types of situation of some of the stuff he's done,0.06534475
recently like kind of questionable and then you see him here as this guy that,0.111760035
left World War Q with a little bit of an emptiness in his soul that,0.3608986
allows him to do just kind of awful things and just kind of shrug it,0.31089434
off and keep on going and as you go throughout the movie and you just,0.082742915
kind of see the sadness of his existence as it continues forward and he just,0.16067682
plays that while never kind of surrendering the coldness of never surrendering the pride but,0.078475505
you just seeing the toll that it takes upon him also it's a movie that's,0.10559437
a return to kind of these classic prestige underground crime mafia type films that you,0.40245858
know over the decade gates there's been many of these that have been created but,0.04528376
over the last decade it's a genre that's kind of gone away a little bit,0.1540356
until you have this legendary director returning to one of his genres that we haven't,0.07700201
seen much of lately and doing a classic version of one of these massive stories,0.071764156
of underground crime spanning large amounts of time huge cast complex plots true drama layered,0.24019952
on top of each other there's just neat to see that again it's also a,0.06024159
movie that for its very long run time which we will talk about that later,0.09640272
in this it's actually a very quickly paced movie it's not long because the scenes,0.10756492
just drag out and there's these extended amounts of dialogue and monologues and open it's,0.10440071
not like that it actually jumps around at a very brisk pace between different plot,0.09467583
lines different time periods different characters there's a lot of different pieces and it touches,0.07371732
on them in a way that you're constantly feel the forward motion and movement inside,0.07902494
of it and so it's it's it's long in a very strange kind of way,0.10863513
because it's just not like most movies like this which was a very pleasant surprises,0.117113076
I've been scared of the runtime going into it it's also a film that gets,0.11367004
very emotional as you move into the third act the first two acts set up,0.10063252
these characters their relationships the dynamics between all of them and then you start moving,0.0954716
into the final hour and some little tragedy hard choices you start to see the,0.06522471
toll that it's taking on them and you see their full lives play out and,0.08753805
where the choices that they've made lead them at the end of their lives and,0.14254576
it really packs an emotional punch as you see all of this play out the,0.2489623
way that it's handled really nicely done inside of that third act with that said,0.108150266
let's move on to the mixed aspects of the film the big thing here is,0.04164017
with a movie of this scope and size with so many plot lines and characters,0.083823286
and seeing these characters at different points of time in their life and it's kind,0.10565785
of jumping around a little bit certain things work entirely clear as we're watching it,0.09881583
my wife said there's a whole lot being implied here that's not clearly stated and,0.11196336
to some extent that's a good thing you don't want the director to treat you,0.1492542
like you're an idiot and over explain everything but because it's so big cuz there's,0.9515855
so much going on at times there we were having conversations while watching the movie,0.07299067
to make sure we weren't confusing which character was which and you know and Anna,0.04043775
Paquin shows up at one point I'm like is that his daughter to his daughter,0.24047993
right which one is it they trying to piece together who is what because there's,0.057427287
just so much to take in in process and it implies a lot it doesn't,0.022916425
spell it out and that can make things at confusing at times I think it,0.09001421
could have done a little bit more to give a couple more details to make,0.061920278
it clear exactly when things were happening how things things tie together but at the,0.061118733
same time I mean I appreciated that you didn't think I was an idiot now,0.8060606
maybe I am a little bit of an idiot now that's why I mean he,0.88824683
spelled out a little bit more but it's kind of is on that right on,0.11164172
that line of did I need a little bit more was it good that it,0.07424934
made me think a little bit and pay attention I'm not entirely sure from there,0.06725076
let's move on to the fat and the big thing here is a little bit,0.3180523
what I kind of implied a little bit earlier but I found the payoff of,0.08101315
the third act to be a lot more engrossing than the set up of the,0.067229584
first two acts now there was a lot of things inside of the first two,0.07639767
acts that were great in scenes that I loved in the general vibe of it,0.09509484
I think worked but there's just so much there and so much to take in,0.047502954
that I think it kind of felt kept me at arm's dinks lengths distance at,0.08424681
times because I'm just trying to sort through all the information all the characters are,0.048240658
lead the Robert DeNiro character is intentionally kind of cold-hearted and so you don't initially,0.0658688
have a big emotional connection to him because he is this hit man that's just,0.15966195
okay with what he's doing and because all of that it made the third act,0.11759361
really stand out and connect with me and resonate with me a lot more than,0.09377005
what came before hand but by comparison during that third act I like felt the,0.036164258
dread of where things were headed I was scared of certain things the choices that,0.0729994
might be made at certain points in time and felt the loneliness of these characters,0.07786172
and I didn't feel that in the first two acts I wasn't sure what I,0.083236754
was supposed to feel at certain points in time I just kind of like interested,0.039046716
in the narrative and then other times I was like okay what am I even,0.065179646
supposed to be paying attention to here and so that third act when it focused,0.05986006
a lot more and we understood the relationships that's when the move you really found,0.08794781
its stride for me and I'd say this is but a lot of discussion on,0.10400577
Twitter as to people posting like hey if you want to watch it in four,0.103690475
chunks here's how you should break it down into four episodes and people like thrashing,0.33301228
them like this is meant to be watched one sitting I don't maybe I shouldn't,0.07582983
say this but I mean I think that there's a lot of merit to the,0.084447004
idea of watching this as four different episodes like if they actually intentionally cut it,0.17057621
that way and you retweet they absolutely the piece is just a little bit to,0.16749078
make for 50 minute episodes out of this that were clearly focused in each piece,0.053989444
I think that would have worked really well I also think the movie if you,0.07829873
trimmed it down to about 2 hours 45 minutes I think it would had a,0.098182596
lot more clarity inside of it and had a lot more punch from beginning to,0.15242739
end as is I think it was just a little bit too big at least,0.22330911
for a film that you're watching at home that's a different experience like if I,0.07535025
was in the theater I think I would have experienced this from very differently than,0.0440677
watching at home with all the distractions the things that happened dogs walking in kids,0.24133033
waking up the things that happen when you're in your home versus the escapism of,0.07721145
a theatre changes the experience and this as a one sit-down movie for three and,0.07004821
a half hours it was a bit rough for me even though there's so many,0.110200174
great things inside it real quick before I give you my final thoughts on this,0.1451131
one be sure to share your thoughts down below in the comment section I know,0.12522449
a lot of people are loving this movie they think it's a masterpiece and so,0.08685175
I think I've imagined we have a bit of a lively discussion between the two,0.05243443
crafts that people have thought it was fantastic and the people that thought it was,0.14596745
a little bit too long and dragged out just be respectful let's share our opinions,0.18775818
the Irishman is a very good film with fantastic performances but that I did think,0.10103173
was a little bit too long even though it did move at a nice brisk,0.1507842
pace it's an a-minus overall it's a 7.5 the entertainment scale and I guess I'd,0.06537829
say it's a must watch for cinema fans be sure to tell me what you,0.1021129
thought down below in the comment section if you want more videos like this check,0.17856579
