hey everyone i'm mariana and let's talk about one of my most anticipated films of,0.052860815
the year Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk I don't think there's a point in me describing the,0.023713132
plot it's exactly what it sounds like world war ii Dunkirk evacuation that's the whole,0.05988715
movie and Christopher Nolan really takes a different approach to a war film here compared,0.042891707
to what we're used to seeing from movies like this it's not a story of,0.018344434
one person's heroism or a story of a smaller group of people getting personal during,0.046016738
the war or a story that involves strategic planning it's none of these things this,0.03247227
is about survival in a very specific situation there is very little dialogue there is,0.022825778
essentially no exposition or backstory from the beginning you are thrown right into the action,0.057031516
and you are just stressed as hell for an hour and 46 minutes now if,0.26091284
you're like me you were probably a little surprised by the pg-13 rating when I,0.04970452
heard that that's what it was earlier this year I was a little skeptical how,0.017135795
is Nolan going to pull off a war film without an r-rating well he does,0.12496007
and it is one of the best war films I've ever seen he does it,0.06845139
with tension he doesn't was sound he doesn't with scale and to be quite honest,0.06707978
I was blown away by this film what's interesting is that no one makes a,0.080136
very conscious choice not to get the audience familiar with the characters because Dunkirk is,0.008524993
not about any one person's story you don't get to find out what their friends,0.02108499
and family situation is you don't know what their hopes and dreams are because that's,0.03177449
really not the point where other directors may take an approach that is more personal,0.024863899
nolan really wants this audience to understand that on this beach while they may all,0.074374184
be different people they're also all the same waiting for ships hoping to get home,0.052518908
trying to survive another day he challenges the audience to root for all of these,0.031880256
soldiers because it's a terrible situation and because war is more than one person's story,0.027754122
we get three different perspectives beach water and air which helps us piece together the,0.016348884
overall picture and while each of these perspectives has their own set of characters the,0.014304109
dialogue is very minimal because there's no reason for them to explain anything they know,0.025584958
what the situation is they're only going to talk when it's necessary and yet even,0.022461256
though we know very little about these people we still get a sense of what,0.03373013
kind of people they are the cast is perfect and I really liked that Nolan,0.09900128
used his stars sparingly while giving a lot of attention to less familiar faces Tom,0.023316016
Hardy and Mark Rylance are probably the biggest names here but they're not there to,0.028434604
show off their performances are beautifully subtle I really appreciated that personally I'm a big,0.033029027
fan of Killian Murphy and he has some great moments here too Finn Whitehead place,0.50290626
Tommy who's our lead character on the beach and though I haven't seen him in,0.02131448
anything else I'm definitely hoping to see more of him in future films he did,0.054995388
really really well and guess what who knew Harry Styles could act to be honest,0.019019596
I would not know that that's who it was that the internet wasn't buzzing about,0.03792611
it for months now because I know next to nothing about one direction but you,0.030356986
know if you are going into this film and you're afraid that you're going to,0.040896155
I roll throughout the whole thing because of Harry Styles he's actually pretty good in,0.025614226
it obviously this is a visually stunning film I don't think we would expect anything,0.037859593
less from Christopher Nolan at this point he knows what he's doing you absolutely must,0.03191817
see dunkirk on the biggest screen you can I saw it at IMAX and that,0.07632982
was some experience also the wonderful Hans Zimmer score is going to play a really,0.022229772
big role in how stressed out you're going to be while watching this movie it's,0.056873865
the ticking bomb type of score that's the best way I can describe it and,0.19077002
it just builds and builds as things are escalating on screen and as you would,0.03568444
expect it gets loud which along the fact that every shot and explosion you hear,0.13087422
sounds very crisp just adds to the overall tension this movie is all tension no,0.04302208
extraneous movie just tension I could talk about this movie for much longer but I,0.03045743
don't want to get into spoilers there were moments that were terrifying to me despite,0.02506279
the lack of graphic violence there were moments that had me tearing up there was,0.09608378
some beautiful powerful writing and there despite the very minimal amount of dialogue I was,0.027274525
rooting for all these characters and I was consistently stressed from the beginning to the,0.017467057
end of the film and I really do appreciate the different kind of approach Nolan,0.022186534
took with this dunkirk was a very memorable and impactful experience for me so here,0.06534365
