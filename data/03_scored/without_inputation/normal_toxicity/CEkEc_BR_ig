[Applause] [Applause] hey everyone today I've got the favorite movie review what do you get,0.05928321
when you have royalty drama with the - of comedy a movie that could be,0.09997088
my favorite so as far as the story goes Jurgis lanthum us directs this period,0.15173228
peace movie that is set in the 18th century where there is a war going,0.12766504
on between England and France but nothing stirs the team war then when you have,0.11372401
to do whatever it takes to make the current Royal on the throne happy even,0.08809843
in the ailing state that she's in I was really curious to know what this,0.22871782
movie was all about it's already got ten nominations - this year's Oscars so it,0.06484233
obviously is something pretty impressive and when I saw it I literally didn't know what,0.08612726
to expect it has a young woman that has this chance to work as a,0.1208971
maid for the Queen and it gets turned into what looks to be this fight,0.14707856
to know their place among all the other employees that work at the palace and,0.06290277
like I said this is a dramatic film it's also got this comedy that you,0.30123472
know brings it all together with these ideas of gaining power and it sometimes is,0.056202937
shown in a ridiculous way especially when certain women of this film especially the leading,0.6622981
ladies have to do whatever it takes to get attention they're all sort of going,0.13400021
off and doing their own thing and it just makes for this really interesting yet,0.07750215
entertaining film as far as the casting goes you've got Olivia Colman who plays queen,0.24014586
and I liked her a lot in this movie I think she definitely pulls off,0.21294567
the royal lead well and also considering the fact that she's going to be in,0.12371619
crown season three is Queen Elizabeth I think that's also proving she's got the acting,0.12289642
chops to wear a crown upon her head and this time she plays this role,0.15481679
with some vulnerability because she's ailing she's always in pain she's always getting help from,0.31851548
Rachel vices character who plays Lady Sarah and they always seem to appear to have,0.08108648
this interesting relationship on-screen probably more so that I originally thought which was really surprising,0.06567796
to me not like that was all done pretty well and of course I'm a,0.20671244
huge fan of Rachel vice because she's just been really impressive and she's also worked,0.082438454
with the director on the lobster as well as Olivia Colman so I thought like,0.12672313
that was a pretty nice reunion to see there and then when you have Emma,0.072276935
Stone brought in who plays Abigail and she's the maid that also gets to have,0.11962572
some encounters with the Queen I thought it was like okay I definitely felt like,0.117811136
there was something going on with her character that just seemed to really have some,0.062235333
kind of frustration I mean it didn't help when you know people were mistreating her,0.1548716
and then Lady Sarah takes her under her wing and everything's supposed to be cool,0.16519853
and called it the cucumber but know things just get crazier from there and of,0.40330195
course Nicholas Hoult I also love to have in a movie like this as well,0.15119936
so the things that I liked about this movie was obviously right off the bat,0.16696623
seeing that production design the art direction and the costume design just really pulled off,0.047716036
this period piece very well and I also really enjoyed the cinematography throughout and especially,0.07205131
when you're constantly seeing a camera following the actors around I mean there's just always,0.0951288
movement there's always some bustling going on in the palace at just looking around their,0.13859318
life through a spyglass lens which I thought was really cool because I did not,0.07642499
expect to see that in a movie like this and despite it sometimes being dizzying,0.10567332
to watch then you've got the music going on so makes it even a peer,0.08700758
hectic with this royal life and how that can all be especially with the current,0.12111171
state of things that were going on during that time whether this is not exactly,0.0651856
based off of true events it's kind of like almost an inaccurate way of portraying,0.099462
this time period but there is some imagery that depicts the savagery of what is,0.20679823
supposed to be this prim and proper royal lifestyle and things are just going on,0.22783431
left and right that you really don't expect to see but unfortunately the things that,0.10707423
I didn't really like about this movie was that I will admit this movie at,0.074429594
times is really boring to watch and I almost fell asleep watching it so I,0.15399453
kind of feel bad that that happened but sometimes it was hard to follow what,0.100682326
exactly was going on because there are certain things that are being talked about that,0.04804463
I'm just like what the heck is this like something about like a treaty or,0.41917425
trades or something going on with different countries and people's relationships with one another I,0.08358619
mean it was all just sort of like going on in my head I don't,0.14347157
know if that's going to make or break me to want to see it again,0.10665759
for a second viewing so overall I would say that the favorite while it's not,0.06642185
my favorite movie of all time I definitely wouldn't stop me from seeing it again,0.10449242
and I may or may not recommend it because some people might be able to,0.09834397
handle a movie like this unlike me but I still thought it was at least,0.15018156
a very interesting movie nonetheless so I would give this three hearts on the heart,0.12938067
