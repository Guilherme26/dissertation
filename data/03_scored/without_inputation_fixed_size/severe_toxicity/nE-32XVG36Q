at me was it a better made don't tell their stories well after the Sun,0.029892022
right Samsung might tell its story perfectly and everything aware it is fantastic he made,0.03292127
the editing cuts on action at perfect moments the camerawork is dynamic he's roaming it's,0.05422444

the story is so well developed that hope does God feel really good arcs it's,0.02605724
really really well put together the other questions I can levy on it are best,0.047250655
if we just knit picks and really really mine and it picks at that so,0.01389103
let's just move where for now let's look at one of the things that's so,0.02158521
great about is just the characters the characters here are iconic like absolutely iconic I,0.015720285
think there's no question here that some of them have gone down in legend the,0.027532617
leaves I'm like kambei is this a jade humble dignified samurai who has seen a,0.075604774
lot of death he's take a fight in and throughout the course of the movie,0.20756856
he would sit more fight in and I think he kind of is the Sun,0.10422097
even the glue the whole summer summer together he's the character who we always respect,0.01168129
and we respect the fact that he sees this lost not was a good thing,0.0593264
even if it's for a noble purpose but really this damn character in some way,0.51209056
is kikuchiyo who is one of the first characters ever put to cinema and he,0.031658087
is one of the best actors want the best arc in cinema the couch it's,0.023196284
a fantastic character he starts off the movie being kind of a laughable fake samurai,0.1152424
he's not excited by the others he's a triangle among the circles he's not the,0.15636405
some way that they respect he's someone who's just a fake his swords oversized his,0.20837542
papers a wrong he's a liar and his lover born is ridiculous and everyone makes,0.40064165
a mockery of him who thought the film they learned to respect it by the,0.15107718
end of the film he has reached the level of Bentley penis I might accepted,0.5156366
as of summer like they expected or something like he gets the same treatment as,0.035327237
a song like he is a samurai despite the fact that he starts off to,0.038415685
be such a laughable fake and there's two moments that define him that ever I,0.18976292
mean with best moments in the film at one point kikuchiyo holds a crying child,0.045984145
while a house behind him burns and I think he at that point he realizes,0.26919276
how far he's come from what he started and I said really keep one for,0.038973108
him on the sudden who he is and what how he's changed and I think,0.051553063
they have a really great point for the future it's a speech midway through the,0.04513737
film well he bakes a samurai for their snobbery towards a farmers or for their,0.18157186
I can give at the farmers and I think it's the best moment in a,0.024276542
film thought of so many fantastic moments it's not my her Cuchillo really reveals who,0.09259556
he is like not just in the literal sense in a very much he reveals,0.073099025
how he feels he the facade has gone and he perfected something right for the,0.026139056
society they leave it for the responsibility in the oppression that goes on the front,0.05370693
of samurai just looking down all those lower than them and for the idea that,0.08016394
the son might have sought wonderful and I think coochie is kind of revelation here,0.09129845
that he doesn't find all of them expecting this I'm right he's really kind of,0.047810074
interesting because that's something he seems to want to be and it's such a fantastic,0.03187693
moment the bricks apart the fell I think it's a moment well look the violet,0.04146156
world around them we see the clarity this is a phone with a bandit sort,0.08868495
of bad guys but there's a point to myth about how the bandits and the,0.10140658
Sun might both leave the cycles of violence that oppressed the peasants it's not just,0.10349193
the pundits who have long in this world and so kikuchiyo lay in that bear,0.060761865
in such a brutal honest fashion the bricks the heart the other characters is such,0.052029334
a fantastic moment in a film that really has so many others but isn't really,0.016096113
count if I were to fill about groups individual don't do you mean much to,0.057828404
this family to feel about a group dynamic so for example the titular taro something,0.03704142
I must be aren't really developed or define but what is define is how everyone,0.035427682
function doing a group we know how the team works even if we don't know,0.04205291
how individuals work and I think what's really important is sometimes I feel about groups,0.03379266
we're curious how I die max his film he has the groups of characters that,0.15154812
move and they even moved he ever unify all split apart and separate and coach,0.02347433
always all of our movement I mean they're film exploring natural movement main wind but,0.04989609
he constantly muses clouds and he constantly uses groups it's about group mentality it's not,0.0588182
about individuals in this film so it's a film where we have peasant versus some,0.07747128
my versus bandits everyone is a separate group never one is expected to for those,0.049198315
world you want to be a Bundy or a farmer or peasant over some way,0.14744727
or wife you know meant to be anything else and so this is a film,0.05797275
where everyone goes into predefined roles in the society as soon as we see this,0.054815125
quite okay we see it wouldn't character who fixed time I will defile his daughter,0.19926041
who's a farmer and sir he gave me her not kind of emphasizes an ugly,0.31481192
truth to society when defined in a way it shows the follows a feudalism that,0.06201906
follows of classifies of privilege it shows how bad they can be and so Seven,0.044454888
Samurai really is a film about the group mentality it's about how people work a,0.03594054
collectivist that it's not about individuality and that's kind of something that makes it a,0.02884968
bit different to films of just like a singular action hero the other thing is,0.04046179
that this is also a hair of those two very traditional hair and narrative the,0.022076115
the seven song right don't necessarily strike whose heroes in heavenly but what they have,0.01783956
is a moral character they're fighting to protect one village it's a very small scale,0.03140598
story just seven song with a woman village it's almost gotten difficult in a way,0.037186425
I think because if I was a judge I caught your consciousness it has become,0.052409153
a myth really the story that Seven Samurai you've saved a village for no reward,0.020014046
and great cost because almost in Heroes is that they're more character says that even,0.012785495
though there is no cost and their glory to this they will fight to the,0.03030111
death then they do fight to quite literally a bad end for a lot of,0.3020513
them fill all of these variations on this idea the actions are always seen and,0.038778212
when it is seen there's often a lot associated with it fighting isn't always novel,0.0120804
and fighting does lead to death if item does lead to suffering and as much,0.13199438
as the fighting here is justified because you've got to see if the peasants and,0.12463945
the bandits there's certainly a task Forte what keys interesting I fixed I'm saying right,0.10784756
it's just a master view like obviously everyone on planet earth who's seen this film,0.06775294
thinks is a masterpiece all they should do at least because it's so obviously is,0.034356736
it among films it is just perfectly put together it's a story which is really,0.030366298
what Paul is never once boring it's fantastically develop the characters are so likable and,0.029829495
if they aren't like people they're interesting the story is simple which we call a,0.050794087
mythos become an active everyone knows it it's inspired counts of us I mean America,0.06269622
did the Magnificent Seven we make it's absolutely groundbreaking it's absolutely astonishing it's a film,0.044007886
which holds up time and time again I watch it pretty much annually and every,0.03599375
single time I love it it's a feminist just it's magnificent and I don't know,0.30576807
what else it is to possibly say well Severus I'm like you don't want to,0.08197923
love words like perfect around because in all honesty nothing is ever truly perfect but,0.031940788
summer sign right you suppose it gets about as close to perfection as you can,0.01894975
get given what it is it does it pretty much perfectly so yeah it my,0.05040695
favorite a lot I know you know I'm not saying it is but there's very,0.02091936
few that are objectively better put together I think there's Seven Samurai and it's just,0.0437458
