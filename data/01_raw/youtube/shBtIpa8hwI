it was great to see how this spider man film was able to tap into the core elements that make the spider-man character so rich and deep even if you happen to know the outcome of certain situations for some characters it won't matter it doesn't take much to feel the pain loss and other emotional challenges that the characters endure thankfully this movie wasn't a total downer and that's because it was actually pretty funny I suppose that is to be expected given the fact that Lord and Miller had a hand in making this film if you're a fan of the past spider-man movies then get ready to laugh your butt off as this film pokes fun at the spider-man movie franchise and drops a number of funny callback references don't laugh too hard though because you may miss out on some of the jokes seriously even the lyrics to the outro credits are pretty funny and before I forget the soundtrack for this movie was just perfect the music transitions seamlessly at different moments to amplify the setting or mood during scenes better yet every song sounds like something Miles Morales would actually listen to as a result both the music and the main character become a bit more relatable now besides having the comedy the drama and the action it's really the characters that serve to be the backbone of this movie shameik Moore was perfectly cast as Miles Morales and Jake Johnson was an ideal fit for this version of Peter Parker that he portrays I think the potential fan favorites that literally got me to laugh out loud will come from Nicolas Cage and John Mulaney spider-man characters okay enough of that let's get right into the bad the bad now the only issue I really have with this movie stemmed primarily from well the animation that I praised earlier while it is vibrant and colorful there's a bit of blurriness that occurs throughout the movie the best way to describe it would be like if you ever walked into a 3d movie and forgot to put your 3d glasses on I'm pretty sure this blurriness was done intentionally since it does maintain the character on screen to be in full focus either way it's just a little bit distracting at times okay enough of that let's get right into the reason the reason spider-man into the spider is hands-down the best spider-man movie to date now I had heard people mention that before going into my screening and in my mind I was like no way could this top spider-man to however I think it did fight a man into the spider-verse just does so many things well that it's incredibly hard to deny its awesomeness if you were halfway hesitant on seeing this just because it's animated worried not the content is definitely suited more so for teens to adults and I am so happy that this movie represented Miles Morales in an authentic and positive way I think this film helps his character live up to be the positive diverse representation that he was created to be this movie has everything a spider-man movie should have and it will only leave you wanting more and I suppose Sony knew exactly what was going on because even before this movie's released they already greenlit the sequel which at this point I cannot wait to see so when it comes to the rating for spider-man into the spider-verse I've got to give it a 9 and a half out of 10 look if you're a spider-man fan comic book fan or if you're just interested in seeing a great story of a hero coming into their own then Spiderman into the spider verse is definitely the movie you want to go see I mean this is nothing short of a must watch in theaters also be sure to stay until the very end for the very hilarious post-credit scene well that's all I got for today thank you very much for joining me are you excited to see spider-man into the spider verse when you do get a chance to go see it please be sure to come on back to this video and in the comments let me know what you think about it and is this actually the best spider-man movie that we've ever gotten I'd like to know where does it rank for you I'm very curious to know what you think so please let me know in the comments down below if you enjoyed this review please share it with your friends and if you happen to know somebody who is a big spider-man fan tag them to this review as well if you're new to my channel please don't forget to subscribe and give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it I've got more videos and reviews to do for you all and until next time I'll see you all later [Music]
