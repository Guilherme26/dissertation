hey everyone it's Mariana I haven't seen you in a bit but I am back,0.122812234
and today let's talk about get out this movie is written and directed by Jordan,0.09555369
Peele it's his feature film directorial debut which is really impressive and is definitely not,0.07617037
your regular horror film I don't even know if I would classify this as a,0.38891226
horror movie because it's the kind of thing that somewhere in between thriller and horror,0.18244316
film but what really surprised me is the amount of humor and satire in it,0.117420636
the story centers around Chris played by Danielle Kaluga who goes to meet his girlfriend's,0.09321733
parents at a pretty secluded location he has some concerns about this because Roth has,0.09617035
not told her parents that he's black and when they gets there things go from,0.50319415
slightly awkward to straight-up weird and that's all I'm going to tell you about the,0.20468782
plot because I think it's definitely one of those movies that's best seen knowing as,0.05403304
little as possible about it so if you haven't seen get out yet which you,0.101614766
absolutely should go see it in theaters that's all you're going to get from me,0.1154622
for the plot this movie is filled with tension and suspense it is absolutely a,0.07008818
very effective thriller it kind of reminded me of the invitation if you've seen that,0.06977938
movie but I did enjoy get out more partly because of the humor and partly,0.11082436
because I think it's just a more clever film in general it does take it's,0.09838094
time to get going also kind of like the invitation it which surprised me a,0.06040244
little bit because it's not a long movie it's about an hour and 43 minutes,0.14941397
I believe but the first 30 to 40 minutes felt longer than the rest of,0.057679344
the film to me and I kind of wish things picked up a little bit,0.13268396
quicker I did really like how it builds up this atmosphere of unease with small,0.13857597
things that escalate it throughout the film one of those things where the situation just,0.022960318
feels off and it may not be anything major or openly aggressive to begin with,0.117821984
but it just puts you on edge the entire time because you feel uncomfortable along,0.17963092
with the character and that's another thing I really enjoyed about get out though wheyhey,0.05181746
films this and the way he tells the story Jordan Peele does a really great,0.07535388
job putting the audience kind of in the shoes of the main character and making,0.06904392
the audience see the situation from Chris's perspective making the audience uncomfortable because of what,0.056292135
he's experiencing and Daniel coleus performance really helps with that as well I would say,0.10765467
in general the performances across the board are very strong not just for a horror,0.10153004
film but for any film I think a lot of us can relate to this,0.035524864
type of anxiety because even though we may not have been in this exact situation,0.06192136
I think a lot of us have experienced being in a social environment or in,0.041934066
a small gathering where things just feel wrong and something about it is passive-aggressive and,0.11071891
it's not something you can easily explain unless things escalate but you know you're not,0.08269588
feeling right in the situation this is also a film that has layers to it,0.061456587
while it is definitely entertaining and fun because of the comedy and because of the,0.09450166
thrills it is a film that has some social commentary it's a film that deals,0.069962494
with racism and stereotypes and the way people treat each other I don't want to,0.33692518
really ruin anything once again but it all comes back to the awkwardness of the,0.1934827
situation and to the perspective and to the way you can interpret what somebody is,0.031569585
saying and you can try to explain it away but that doesn't mean you're going,0.061080858
to feel any more comfortable I do wish that the filmmakers have stayed away from,0.06286405
jump scares because the jump scares and get out are so unnecessary there's a kind,0.15530002
of jump scare that just startles you with a loud sound and nothing scary is,0.22194667
really happening and I find things like that annoying as you know and they're not,0.21757393
really all over the place but there are a few so that was kind of,0.07649065
a bit disappointing for me overall though get-out is a film that you should definitely,0.38977543
check out it just works on so many levels it is an effective and suspenseful,0.08125915
thriller it is a clever set tired had me laughing quite a bit throughout the,0.21174347
film even though it never really turned into a comedy it was just part of,0.081324734
the entertaining experience it was smart and funny it was well shot it was well,0.2676857
written and all of that makes it very much rewatchable so absolutely check it out,0.08132159
