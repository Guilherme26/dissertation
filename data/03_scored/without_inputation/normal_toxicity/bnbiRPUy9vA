what's up guys it's Katie and here it is the spoiler review for Star Wars,0.07215818
the last Jedi I did make a no spoiler review,0.09380889
so if you haven't seen that click right on up here check it out,0.07375109
there are absolutely no spoilers in that one,0.08930852
this is the spoiler review I love to the movie okay I'm just catching you up,0.15236437
I absolutely loved it,0.055839743
I personally think it is the best newer Star Wars movie it is definitely number one for me after the original trilogy,0.06497183
I absolutely loved it,0.055839743
I just want to talk about all the spoilers,0.06559784
so I guess we'll just jump right on in my brain is literally all over the place right now because there are so many different things that I want to talk about that I absolutely loved about this film,0.2684805
so I'm just gonna start with the cast,0.097070195
okay there are some characters that I liked in the force awakens,0.05409784
but in this movie I loved like I got a say,0.081287876
and I said this is my no spoiler review that I am probably one of the few people in the world that thought kylo Ren was freaking awesome in this movie alright I know a lot of people like to say he's just a big cry-baby,0.42276567
well he is and that's kind of what I like about him because a lot of times we get these villains that are you know you can maybe relate to something bad that happened in their past that made them this horrible human today but with kylo Ren he literally feels so relatable like I feel like we've all had that moment in our lives whether we were kids or teenagers or adults,0.31575626
we're you know we we were just so angsty and stubborn and mad at the world like we've all been there,0.2575903
so I really like seeing that represented in a film and honestly I like that about kylo Ren,0.07197233
I wanted more scenes with him and Rey I loved every single scene everytime it cut away from when they were chatting with each other,0.14973557
I was like no go back,0.119897224
I want more of that I want to I want to know more like there was this weird connection or chemistry that they had I loved that,0.07421437
they didn't go all like romance with it because it so I really liked their scenes together,0.14279783
and how they were basically talking about the exact same things just coming from two different sides one being a dark side,0.07861739
and one being a light side even though they both have both qualities in them like it just was really interesting for them to be talking to each other and kind of relating with each other,0.107907966
and in later on kylo actually saving Ray's life which was incredible like usually I'm really good at predicting these moments but when I saw that lightsaber moving I'm like ooh Ray's gonna like unleash some crazy sort she's gonna go like Wonder Woman everywhere but no that was awesome,0.31488186
I was not expecting that moment with kylo Ren saving her so that was that was something that was really really cool that I thoroughly enjoyed and then watching them fight together,0.16093658
oh my gosh their fight sequence together was probably my favorite part of the whole movie I'm not gonna lie just the the production value of that moment with like all the men in red and just the atmosphere of where they were and the actual choreography of the fight,0.19044349
sequences like it just was outstanding,0.08297674
I loved that I can't wait to go watch it again,0.111731194
because that moment for me I was just sitting there like eyes wide mouth open I'm just like oh my gosh I thoroughly liked Ray's journey throughout this movie especially with Luke Skywalker and how they just they were able to make these really really funny moments within such a serious world and a serious thing happening,0.15116677
I felt like the story felt very contained which was awesome,0.047189277
it was literally like just saved the rebels from being extinct and that was just your a2b,0.17509949
but there was so much that happened in the middle of these tiny little plot points like C and D and E plot points between a and B that I just thought were so smart and I absolutely loved it,0.15431283
and it just made the movie feels so action-packed and entertaining and there was just constantly something going on which I loved I really liked that Luke Skywalker was kind of like this hard-ass at the beginning like he really was um he still is I mean let's let's face it,0.6080428
he's like grumpy old man,0.74479234
Luke Skywalker but I really liked that because you had this like young and courageous full of hope ray versus like the old man like it just was fun,0.24177475
and I liked their dynamic a lot I don't know about you but those pores are like so cute,0.23043251
they were funny and adorable and sad,0.08236888
and I want them all and they I just absolutely loved them,0.091409616
I love the addition of new creatures into the Star Wars world,0.06937663
I really enjoyed Poe's storyline throughout this movie I they just they just did such a good job giving every single character a full arc and a full purpose like we've been seeing so many movies this year that have huge ensemble cast,0.037246183
and we're just getting like tiny little bits here there of like even even a huge character just being like butt of all the jokes,0.56242764
but in Star Wars they had an ensemble cast of characters who had full stories to complete in this movie which I loved and for Poe it was basically him being kind of like a little bit of a hothead and I just I'm gonna run in there and I'm gonna blow things up into actually becoming a little bit more strategic of a leader that he definitely could be and so watching his journey especially going against Authority and then kind of learning that maybe he should do a little more listening,0.24022512
even though you know his hearts in the right place,0.059053935
I just I loved his storyline,0.10697983
we had a new character Rose played by Kelly Marie Tran holy moley,0.17952697
oh my gosh you guys,0.18030868
I don't know about you but I absolutely loved her absolutely loved her,0.15222955
I thought,0.039424464
she was such an incredible addition to the story and made for such an awesome duo with Finn,0.048881624
I can't even believe that a movie that was you know two hours,0.15088569
and some on change could have,0.05986972
so many things happen for different characters in just one movie the action sequences,0.056170356
were,0.024826352
so incredible,0.030955464
especially the final action sequence with the salt,0.048064407
and how it was like red contrasted with white,0.14742754
I absolutely thought that was genius,0.12888484
because it gave us a practical reason to have like a red sky,0.058265608
you know we've seen some other movies where it's just all CGI,0.10584455
and the skies are just so red or orange and you're like well why,0.065935
and at least in this movie we had a reason it was the salt and every time they moved the salt red would come up from it,0.058754977
and it just created this incredible element to the film and it was beautiful to watch and definitely add its dynamic and depth to everything,0.047636915
I don't know about you guys,0.19329154
but when I saw Oda pop in I lost it,0.08730965
I think the whole crowd was cheering we were just not expecting Yoda to be in this movie at all,0.07265387
but I really like I liked Luke's journey and how Yoda fit into that and it and it kind of just came full circle,0.053930152
I'm not sure if he's gonna come back or not I kind of hope he does because he was obviously very helpful and I don't feel that his relationship with kylo has been a hundred percent resolved yet so I'm kind of hoping Luke comes back for that oh my gosh Carrie Fisher watching her was just heartbreaking,0.1162714
she just looked absolutely stunning just stunning and she just her character got to do some incredible things in this movie and she played such an important role,0.14007428
it's just heartbreaking to watch knowing that she's no longer with us but to watch her shine in this movie was just it,0.15018238
I don't know it made me sad,0.09767513
but in a happy way if that makes sense she just was so incredible in this movie and I it just it was beautiful and holy moly Lane's got the force oh my god another moment where I was freaking out and screaming,0.18666974
I was just like what what what but after all these years how wait can we go back like can we just like get a little like flash back or something like how how did this happen,0.08572679
for the first time is this a new thing has she had it this whole time,0.06827338
and none of us have realized this this might be really deep of a question,0.07719457
and it probably might be in a book somewhere but um yeah was that a shocker for you guys,0.09940095
it was this something that you expected is it something you didn't like cuz,0.14467321
I was all about it,0.055437762
I was like,0.039237786
yeah that makes sense,0.056897335
I've always wondered why Luke had the force and she didn't so heck yeah and I know I'm probably like forgetting to talk about a million things just because there's so much that happened in this movie and so much of it that I liked between the action the acting the production value the music everything,0.13071057
I just this movie really blew me away and I kind of wasn't expecting it to have this much of an impact on me but it really did I wanted more of this movie when it ended I was like no,0.14800222
