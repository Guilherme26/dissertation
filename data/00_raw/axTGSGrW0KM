all right people so this week we got another spike Lee joint by the name of black Klansmen so let's get alright so this movie is starring John David Washington Topher Grace and Adams driver and it's directed by Spike Lee and when I'll give him too much away basically the premise of this movie is we have a young black rookie cop in Colorado Springs that helps infiltrate a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan so what worked for the movie I gotta say Spike Lee has kinda had some hit and misses these past couple of years but with black Klansmen I really enjoyed this movie I liked it a lot the acting was pretty good can't really complain there was probably like one or two scenes where I just felt like some actors then like a hundred percent delivered like how they should have in certain scenes better than that the acting was pretty good I felt like this was a well written home story for the movie I was intrigued the whole time and there was some good comedy in it there's this one character in particular that I think the audience are gonna love and laugh at this character so yeah this movie was a well made enjoyable movie and I really can't complain about this movie alright so as far as negatives go I don't really have a lot back to complain about this movie like I said before this is a pretty good Spike Lee movie it's not his best movie but it's pretty good from what he's delivered to us in these past couple years so as far as negatives though I don't know I feel like maybe the movie could have been ten minutes shorter I don't know Adam driver in certain scenes I just couldn't get Kyle ran out of my head don't get me wrong and I felt like he did a pretty good job but there was just certain scenes when he was talking I was just like oh that's kind of over in there I know that I alright so over all people I feel like everybody from all walks of life should go check out this movie you might learn something so Carlos scale one to ten will give this movie a solid a very enjoyable entertaining movie like I said you might learn something if you go watch it so definitely check it out at your local theaters not sure if it's playing in IMAX anywhere else so the admission price is definitely well worth it you're not gonna spend in X amount of dollars singing it and it's probably worth buying a blu-ray when it comes out so if you like what you see and you want to see more please hit that subscribe button after hitting the subscribe button hit the bell button so you get notified every time I upload a video and please hit the like button and leave a comment at the bottom [Music]
