what's going on all my youtube buddies i'm jacob with another movie review for you guys and in today's video i'm taking a look at a classic alfred hitchcock film that i think deserves more attention rebecca as part of the criterion collection man i love the criterion man that's a beautiful cover it's so creepy and haunting and it's oh man i love these covers so rebecca was released in 1940 this was directed of course by alfred hitchcock it was based on an acclaimed novel by i think it says on here her name is daphne dumouria based on her novel and this was alfred hitchcock's first hollywood production alfred hitchcock was already a successful director in britain he had made a lot of well-regarded british cinema in the 1930s with films such as the man who knew too much the 39 steps and the lady vanishes hollywood was starting to pay attention to alfred hitchcock's talents particularly david selznick who was hot off the success of recent best picture winner and at the time the highest grossing film of all time gone with the wind and so they ended up working together on rebecca hitchcock's first hollywood production rebecca while not as monumental of a success has gone in the wind was still a huge hit as well especially for putting hitchcock on the map to talk to a larger wider audience than what he was doing in england i am moving to hollywood got him a lot more attention from a wider variety of film fans and moving into the us actually paid off as rebecca won some academy awards as well particularly best picture and because of that alfred hitchcock ended up making more signature films that really signified his talents creating iconic classics that are still beloved to this day like their window vertigo north by northwest psycho the birds none of these movies wouldn't be possible without rebecca so this is a very influential film in hitchcock's filmography a very game-changing film in his filmography is it still a masterpiece this very day let's find out together doing rebecca joan fontaine plays a young woman who believes she has found her heart's desire when she marries the dashing aristocratic whether were maxim de winter but upon moving into manderlay her groom's baroque ancestral mansion she soon learns that his deceased wife rebecca haunts not only the estate but the temperamental brooding maxim as well and besides joan fontaine this movie also stars lawrence olivier george sanders judith anderson and gladys cooper so this was the first time i had seen rebecca in a few years back when i was starting to get into classic cinema i think about eight years ago now uh rebecca was one of the first alfred hitchcock films ever watched i distinctly remember the first two alfred hitchcock films i remembered watching rebecca and the birds the birds being the very first and rebecca was one of the first hitchcock films i remember watching as well i was intrigued to get into that one because i knew that it was the only alfred hitchcock film to win best picture and i wanted to see what made the academy love the film so much and watching rebecca it's pretty easy to see why i think this is one of the more melodramatic films in hitchcock's filmography i guess because hitchcock paired with david selznick who just did gone with the win this sweeping melodramatic epic film one of the best films of its era and so him pairing with alfred hitchcock to create a melodramatic romance but also very gothic and very psychological as well i think they were a great pair now hitchcock has later come out and said he was a little dissatisfied with the making of rebecca he didn't get full creative control like he did in his later films he definitely had some tension with selznick throughout the making of the film selznick wanted to do some things hitchcock want to do some things and so there was a little bit of a tension between the two but i don't feel any tension watching the film i feel like in the final version of the film there's still a great balance between the psycho drama that makes hitchcock films rewarding mixed with the melodrama that made uh david selznick a prominent producer back at the time uh back in the day and i think it's a pretty good match uh the cinematography in this film is very haunting throughout very atmospheric and very gothic i really love the way uh the movie makes you feel the presence of somebody who's never really on screen this rebecca character the former wife of maxim who tragically died and everybody's comparing her to the new wife that joan fontaine is playing and it just makes for a very unsettling film it's not a scary film by any means it's more of a psychological thriller that where the fear in the film is upon expectations it falls upon obsession it falls upon expectations where you're trying to do your own thing but everybody's comparing you to somebody that they think is better and that just makes for a very very creepy experience at times especially the housekeeper character mrs danvers played by judith anderson we as soon as you see her on screen she is one creepy woman very much obsessed with rebecca has like a her own room shrine dedicated to this woman there's a little bit of creepy undertones to her character when you're like how did this make it past the sensors some of the stuff she says and the stuff she keeps but she is so good in this role she's probably the scene stealer of rebecca because of how creepy she is you also got like i said jim fontaine plays the young woman who marries lawrence olivier and is struggling to do her own thing as the new wife while struggling to learn more about the mystery of who rebecca was and why people are obsessed with her and then there's a lot of crazy twists as well between her relationship to maxim lawrence olivier there's a lot of good twists in this film uh the romance in the film is uh pretty compelling throughout between joan and lawrence olivier horns olivier is so good as maxim very much one of the best dramatic actors of that time who committed to every role that he was in in such a theatrical presence and it's another remarkable performance here in rebecca the very brooding shy man struggling to cope with a loss so severe while also trying to find new love and move on as well movie moves at a pretty good pace it's a little bit slow at times and it's run time because of the nature of the story but it all leads to a very rewarding payoff in the end i did enjoy the twists and turns in regards to what really happened the the mystery surrounding rebecca's death and what was really going on and what lawrence olivier's true feelings and regards are and then uh some of the other mysterious figures that have had a connection to rebecca there's another character that claims to be her cousin who is played by george sanders if you're a disney fan you may know him as the voice of sheer khan in the jungle book he shows up in the film and he's pretty entertaining as well i enjoyed his small part as somebody that has his own agenda and trying to solve the rebecca death and he has an interesting connection with her as well which i'm not going to spoil but definitely want to take the cousin term lightly here that's all i'm going to say the movie is very well scored it has a very eerie score throughout and while this movie is not as suspenseful or as intense as some of hitchcock's later films i do agree that when hitchcock got full creative control he made some of the best movies of the golden age of hollywood like look to psycho and vertigo rear window and some of the very very best alfred hitchcock films but he was getting his start in hollywood i get that and his first hollywood production still really good i did enjoy the mix of the psycho drama the melodrama the gothic atmosphere it's still an excellent atmospheric watch i don't know if it would have been my pick for best picture that year because 1940 i know the great dictator came out that year i love that film from charlie chaplin uh the grapes are raph is another excellent drama that came out that year i like those movies a little bit more than rebecca and i think they probably would have been my picks for best picture one of the two of course the academy doesn't care for animation films if if it was a truly fair year like pinocchio or fantasia should have been in there in the running as well but rebecca is a really great film nonetheless it's one of my favorite alfred hitchcock films i know it's not the best alfred hitchcock film but i'm strangely attracted to it and i think it's because of the atmosphere the atmosphere in this film really sells the movie for me and every time i've rewatched it i've really really dug it and i do appreciate rebecca even more on every rewatch that i see of it so if you have not seen rebecca and if you're an alfred hitchcock fan this is a good film to check out your enjoyment of the film depends on i guess your experience with it but for me this is one of the best out for hitchcock films probably in my top 10 i don't know um i haven't seen all alfred hitchcock's film but this is a really good one and i'm going to give rebecca a 5 out of 5 stars and on the 100 point scale it's getting a 92 out of 100. so that wraps up my review of rebecca i meant to do this review last month in august when i was celebrating out for
