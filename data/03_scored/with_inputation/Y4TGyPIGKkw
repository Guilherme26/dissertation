when the movie Selma came out it was a hit and a critical darling but,0.07621898
there was significant controversy surrounding it and that was the historical accuracy given that this,0.033383373
shows intent is to analyze history in film I thought it was about time to,0.05690763
tackle that problem head-on after having watched the movie though I think the fact checkers,0.1055875
have actually gone too far we'll get into that and more because this film shows,0.11099895
you what I've been saying all along on these episodes then it is a good,0.09162806
historical movie if the inaccuracies do not affect the narrative and Selma is just that,0.09149387
a good historical movie an inspirational one at that but it only slips into that,0.09920893
category I had a difficult decision in proclaiming this one good because there are some,0.033833556
problems but I don't think they affect the narrative the civil rights movement had been,0.061047077
producing significant results since the end of World War two in the fight to end,0.11182508
segregation it kind of officially achieved that with the 1964 Civil Rights Act but enforcement,0.06678027

vote is if an approve registered vote of vouchers for you many of those laws,0.08841001
survived the Civil Rights Act because they were technically not racially selective even though in,0.1333298
practice they really were a group called the Dallas County voters League later joined by,0.04187609
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee snick for short had launched a campaign in Selma to,0.07583133

the 50 mile walk from Selma to the state's capital in Montgomery on March 7th,0.040045843
1965 but didn't get very far as soon as they crossed the bridge that separated,0.058780253
Selma along the county line coincidentally named after a Confederate officer and high-ranking KKK member,0.15328178
police state troopers and vigilantes attacked the procession in a coordinated and brutal fashion it,0.24892606
was so horrendous that newspapers called the event Bloody Sunday because it was well publicized,0.31493253
thousands of people came from across the country to take part in another march a,0.09030614
second march was staged this time with King and the front of it a court,0.059029453
order had mandated that the March could not cross the county line at the bridge,0.06654993
but when they came to the top of the bridge again the troopers actually made,0.07090765
way for the marchers the entire procession kneeled in prayer and then King turned them,0.07174058
around keeping in line with the court order but confusing the rest of the marchers,0.05156803
because of this the second march became known as turn around Tuesday during the night,0.097771265
the KKK assaulted three white protesters beating one of them so badly that he died,0.6364068
within hours several protests were organized in Montgomery because of the failure of turn around,0.12664185

though he had been working on it since Bloody Sunday with perhaps his most famous,0.1711751

protests this movie goes out of its way to be accurate the marchers are staged,0.1573418
to match archival footage and the general Vince line up perfectly the film could not,0.041069582
procure the rights to King's actual speeches which are technically still copyrighted even though they,0.05115288
could have claimed fair use and used the actual words they instead paraphrased quite succinctly,0.039374866
to the point that I thought I was listening to an actual speech at one,0.07934138
point the LBJ speech on the other hand had no qualms with simply quoting him,0.16938753
for the most part actors just nail mannerisms of these folks this recreation of Selma,0.107704364
has been done before so they were retreading some ground but the story is more,0.097302005
involved than selma lord selma and far superior in fidelity and quality the best part,0.0812217
is where the movie shows the way that the whole thing was organized we really,0.05715768
get to see the ideology behind selma and what made it tick we do is,0.0649514
negotiate demonstrate resist and a big part of that is raising fight consciousness and in,0.09193595
particular the consciousness of whichever white man happens to be sitting in the Oval Office,0.44336125
this is important work because too often do we get the X happened which caused,0.08380131
y approach to the civil rights movement but here we get to see the internet',0.06520237
scene fights among civil rights leaders you want us to bring our people in but,0.11511049
you're not giving anything in return now we are asking for some kind of commitment,0.10502178
the motivation for selecting Soma we don't fight and the reason for so much momentum,0.14991815
being necessary in obtaining voting rights there have been thousands of racially motivated murders in,0.43288356
the South including those for girls no the astounding fact that not one of these,0.20289895
criminals who murder us when and why they want has ever been convicted one conviction,0.3129659
because they are protected by flight officials chosen by an all-white electorate and on the,0.31089434
rare occasions that they face trial they are freed by all-white juries Oh for instance,0.5154597
just listen to the speech dismantling your own legacy with each passing day no one,0.20156899
will remember the Civil Rights Act but they will remember the standoff in summer when,0.014399836
you never even set foot in this state they will remember you saying wait and,0.1186099
I can't unless you act sir that's incredible you really get a sense of what,0.14302123
this fight was all about there are so many other clips I could show but,0.15291262
I'll just say if you haven't watched this movie just go watch it there's not,0.111927405
much here but I'll just run through them real quickly the church bombing that took,0.41611564
out the girls in the beginning was a year earlier than King getting the Nobel,0.17216636
Peace Prize but the movie is showing it to illustrate the speech he made for,0.09635856
receiving the award not to show the chronology the person who attacked King in the,0.18665768
hotel actually punched him twice and kicked him while he was on the ground the,0.769733
KKK member was sent to jail for a month because of it and fined $100,0.25746682
some of the SCLC leadership was in on the turn around Tuesday secret it was,0.0770741
understood by them as part of complying with the core order and avoiding another Bloody,0.35360017
Sunday but the movie is correct in saying that it was a surprise to everyone,0.052146584
else both of people killed in the movie took a while to die of their,0.5843437
wounds rather than dying on the spot but that's alright since the movie needs to,0.08340764
save time there is one thing that this movie has been going back and forth,0.069277816
over but I think it's unwarranted it is implied that Johnson ordered a blackmail package,0.12886608
sent to King to stop the first Selma March get me J Edgar Hoover historians,0.1488414
are correct in pointing out that there is no evidence to show that Johnson did,0.0633626
this but here's the thing the blackmail thing really did happen they go ruin me,0.2766346
yeah because J Edgar Hoover the unjustifiably powerful director of the FBI had been monitoring,0.08845294
King for years and had caught him cheating on his wife on several occasions the,0.35197964
black mantle incident happened sometime in early 1965 though we don't know when but it,0.27263722
never caused much of an effect on King or his wife because he had already,0.21549875
confessed his wrongdoings to her beforehand so yeah the implication is incorrect but it is,0.2563408
only implied through montage nor does it make a big difference for the narrative instead,0.039235923
we see the differing stances on what needs to be accomplished first between MLK and,0.0822234
LBJ which is quite accurate what the movie gets wrong on this front was that,0.12391606
it does not show the stress that LBJ was under because of Vietnam it keeps,0.092326604
talking about the Great Society legislation that he proposed almost a year prior I'll call,0.07499593
it the war on poverty instead the Vietnam War was escalating exactly during these few,0.103398554
weeks the official ground war began on March 8th a day after Bloody Sunday that,0.23965314
was what was preoccupying LBJ when he said to King something along the lines of,0.11377676
this you've got one big issue now you demanded more and put me on the,0.24202201
spot with this visit that's okay that's your job that's what you do but I,0.106866285
am sick and tired of you demanding and telling me what I can and what,0.33740193
I can't do now historians have been saying that the moving unnecessarily it demonizes LBJ,0.098789625
but I would argue it's easy to see it the other way around he was,0.08029311
more preoccupied with a spurious war than helping people at home yet the movie makes,0.18006799
him out to be more preoccupied with domestic problems in general and political necessity what,0.12968647
he needs to do is get on board with what we're doing instead of the,0.06385976
other way around for once but here's the thing despite it not showing the correct,0.060769513
preoccupation of LBJ's it does show that he was preoccupied and then it was soma,0.100780554
that pushed him to act you see the movie doesn't alter the narrative just tweak,0.07852515
some things to not have to get bogged down in others all movies necessarily cut,0.14779486
stuff this could easily have been a three-hour snorefest like so many other movies but,0.070660695
instead the narrative stays intact and what is cut is not necessary sure I would,0.062680244
like to have seen other civil rights leaders depicted in this like we could have,0.029844914
seen a legion of people trying to register to vote and not just one but,0.06907701
one is all it takes that is why the movie is still good historically despite,0.036945406
its inaccuracies now you know that I research this stuff prior to watching although I,0.09288213
didn't use to so I get really deep into the way that filmmakers react to,0.05604796
fact-checkers I always see the typical pablum of you got this wrong so everything's wrong,0.14185542
or it's just a movie you know the platitudinous argument that is between slender and,0.13639171
artistic license things like this or this I've been doing this series for a while,0.051364824
now and I had to develop a mode of critiquing based on the true stories,0.08471223
but this movie in particular made me have to kind of reassess that being said,0.09211765
I think my original assertion from last year is still correct you don't get to,0.05337472
have artistic license when dealing with the truth not at least if you're changing the,0.05437994
narrative what really set me off on this is when I saw the director of,0.062094036
this movie wrote an editorial saying it's not a documentary I'm not a historian I'm,0.10447966
a storyteller now that's just idiotic historians are also storytellers they're just forced to use,0.73762304
evidence to show that their story is true besides no worthwhile historian claims to be,0.0860006
a hundred percent accurate we make mistakes as I do all the time on this,0.054396093
channel why do you think we're arguing all the time amongst each other just as,0.052131355
historians are allowed to make errors artists are allowed to purposely flub stuff as long,0.15177982
as it does not affect the narrative furthermore there is a difference between facts and,0.035061184
interpretation when historians are angry about what this is the vilification of LBJ and funny,0.11567604
enough most of those historians are from the LBJ library so they have a vested,0.12063015
interest in their particular narrative but as I showed earlier that is an interpretation not,0.05349012
a fact if you can't differentiate between the two then you should make fiction not,0.08131146
based on a true story movies this is a competent movie but if the director,0.07524265
is going to be this kind of foolish then maybe she should stay away from,0.7688647
these kinds of movies from now on with real people and true stories you don't,0.0739557
get to take artistic license to the point of changing the actual narrative without incurring,0.06789826
the ire of the historical community that's simply falsifying the past instead of arguing whether,0.07264926
it's right to fact-check movies which it undoubtedly is we should be trying to find,0.05666431
out if the narrative of the movie diverges enough from reality to be inaccurate history,0.071473144
is the story of us and Selma is an important component of that story so,0.04202615
telling it correctly is vital to understanding ourselves it is a building block to reality,0.08644165
and to be inaccurate as in to get the overall narrative incorrect is simply to,0.07472633
breed ignorant so how does this movie stack up to this measure does it actually,0.7401385
help us understand reality does the movie Selma misrepresent the actual Vence narrative no it,0.051806796
actually strengthens it and gives it new life it has its faults but none too,0.14759889
great to affect the narrative and that's what counts Selma is a good based on,0.0952988
