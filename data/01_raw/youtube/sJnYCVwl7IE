hello everybody today I'm going to be reviewing Logan directed by James Mangold as you may have heard this is Hugh Jackman's last time playing the grizzly chiseled comic book character Wolverine and as his last outing he and Matt gold together they both decided they wanted to have a different take on the x-men Wolverine canon with this villain they took a really bold risk here I think because this is not like a typical superhero movie at all and I don't mean that it takes risks in terms of the narrative because there's it's very familiar there's nothing there that we haven't seen before in terms of the narrative but it's more in the execution of it the style of the film that really stands out to me and I think that it really paid off this film is like a rusty pipe of a villain it's very gritty it's extremely violent and it feels very warm you feel every stab in the film the sting of all of the wounds it's very physical a physical film and it's nothing like a lot of those glossy cgi more soulless true superhero films that we've grown so accustomed accustomed to seeing in the past and I find that refreshing quite honestly I think that this is a film with soul it has a moral compass and it tries to strip away all of those more obvious tropes the film starts with a brawl between Wolverine and several men and Wolverine gets knocked to the ground while he's on the ground the camera is right next to him and you see in the corner of the frame Logan the name of the film and I feel like that image you know with the title of the film in it is a perfect metaphor for so much of what the film is is about what it's trying to say that this is not about Logan in his in his prime this is about a man who is growing much older who is being beaten down offense he's very weary and hurting both mentally and physically realizing that mortality is starting to eat away at him quite literally the film takes place in 2029 I believe and it's a far more cynical world very kind of dystopian that really reflects a lot of the social consciousness the darkness that we're experiencing right now Logan is caring for Charles Xavier of course the professor Eck's and he also was very very old and he keeps trying to lose his mind they both come across a young girl who is a mutant that is being pursued by the antagonist the film this these corporate forces who want to turn her into a weapon so I said it's a familiar story this is nothing we haven't seen before but she is that representation of the next generation they'd be the youth that could use her power for good it's a chase movie basically and I think that it's something that the director men gold is very comfortable directing I mean we've seen him do films like that in the past he's a very classical director he likes to kind of borrow from lots of genre pieces of the past I mean we saw that in his remake for 3:10 to Yuma which I thought was a really solid movie there are a lot of kind of callbacks to a lot of those nostalgic narratives that you see echo in this film morally visually there are call out to films like Shane which is of course a classic film as well and that someone really helps to shape the symbolism and the themes in this one this would be kind of reminds me of the Last of Us which is a video game but I think it could have easily been a film as well they're both similar stories similar ideas in terms of the tone but Naughty Dog's a company who made that film well art started this video game they wanted to make a game that was different from games we had seen in the past they wanted it to be a more cinematic experience one that really draw on emotion so they really tried to develop great complex characters that you're playing and there's a real ensemble and I think that this movie does the same thing in a lot of ways it takes a genre that in my opinion has become very stale and increasingly more uninteresting as time goes on but if instead it's doing something more bold I think it's stripping back the story and focusing much more on the pay so we see the characters arcs and we get to see them explored much more than we have in any of the other x-men films that I've seen at least yeah it does resort to certain cliches here and there that I think that some could have done without but overall I was I was very convinced by it I know I have criticized superhero films in the past I have talked about how I think that they are too literal and too realistic and they sacrifice a lot of their artfulness in the fantasy aspect of what makes a comic book film or sorry a comic book or a graphic novel so special but I actually think it works in this instance because of how well they sell it it takes the gloves off and goes all in to the point it doesn't even feel like a comic-book movie at all I think that somebody could just walk in and see this and they probably wouldn't really need much context I mean it even includes the x-men comic book within the movie at kind of a fable to contract that fantasy from reality so we can look at the situation and see that it's very separate from what people believe the idealism of it all and it really does succeed in terms of just being a dramatic work because of the the core themes of the story they're very intact they're very resonant and they're consistent all the way through I've seen a couple people here in their describe this film as a nihilistic film and I don't see it that way at all I really disagree to me this is the opposite of a nihilistic film it's a film that masks itself and nihilism but it begins to peel back those layers of hardened calluses to reveal what is important which is love vulnerability the need to connect and how that leads us to the feeling of hope that yes morality is real that people like Charles Xavier and Logan are both aging rapidly and Logan seems to be rotting from the inside and in some way but the fact is that were all rotting technically from the day we're born we're slowly getting closer to our imminent fate so we must choose how we spend our life whether it's learning to love or running away from that vulnerability in those emotions and that's really the main conflict here in terms of what Logan is struggling with he's realizing that he does have responsibilities as a man and she can either of course be the loner that he's always been or he can learn to take his legacy and pass it on to the next generation and it's done in a way that is very kind of emotionally gut wrenching I would say I was very moved by the film and I think a lot of people are going to be as well especially the hardcore x-men film fans there is a lot to admire about this movie so yeah thumbs up and that's my review thank you all for listening if you'd like to follow me on
