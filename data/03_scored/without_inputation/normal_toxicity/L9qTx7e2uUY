in the 2017 motion picture of the shape of water,0.051781554
the United States government captures a new species an amphibian man Eliza,0.15990616
a mute woman who works at the facility that houses him falls in love with him and rescues him her employer a man named Strickland investigates this disappearance until eventually discovering Eliza intends to release the amphibian man into the sea over the course of the film we see various ways in which social systems oppressed minorities or people with less political power ableism in the form of how Eliza is treated due to her disability racism of course sexism,0.34738523
well it's the 1950s,0.050738584
so what do you think the amphibian man is not a direct allegory for any particular oppressed people the way say lesser films clumsily utilize allegory instead the amphibian man is more of a grander symbol for the concept of the other director Guillermo del Toro explained it himself the monster is a cipher,0.2363523
it's a symbol,0.06517929
it's an embodiment of more than anything else other Ness,0.08113765
I needed to talk about acceptance and love in a very urgent way,0.07708173
I feel it as an immigrant that has been received by this country,0.173797
but I still feel there is a sort of demonization of the other very present,0.10232872
I needed to talk about the beauty of the other,0.05014552
but guillermo del toro is touching on here is a sociological concept of the other the idea of other nests essential to sociological analysis of how majority and minority identities are constructed this is because the representation of different groups within any given society is controlled by groups that have more political power than the other in the setting of the film for example white people constructed the social identities of racial minorities by representing them through stereotypes and superficial observations when Strickland meets Zelda the cleaning woman mentions that she is an only child Strickland incented remarks that this is unusual for her people a minute or so later Strickland mentions the appearance of God and says that he probably looks more like Strickland than like Zelda so in everything from social matters to religion Strickland is constructing,0.11625644
the representation of another people later in the film the diner employee tells the african-american couple that they are not allowed to sit down,0.31089434
at the counter uttering,0.056152627
other,0.03234011
people has obvious discriminatory aspects,0.16264834
that,0.038000632
permeate throughout social interaction,0.07642469
and even the law but there is also a psychological component to it social identities reflect the way individuals and groups internalize their established social categories within their societies such as their cultural identities class identities gender identities sexual identities and so forth these social categories shape our ideas about who we think we are how we want to be seen by others and the groups with which we belong one of the major contributing factors to ending racial segregation in America was proving that this had a severe negative psychological effect on children social identities are created through ongoing social interaction with other people and the resulting self-reflection about who we think we are according to these interactions,0.21314968
this is something called the looking glass self social identities are produced through agreement and disagreement with other people,0.15133435
and we adjust our behavior,0.0763285
and self-reflection based on these interactions,0.28118736
when Strickland invades Zelda's home to discover the location of the amphibian man her husband Brewster briefly objects before almost immediately backing down and allowing Strickland to manhandle his wife he also gives up the location of Eliza,0.11309105
and the amphibian man this interaction is terrifying,0.15140153
to watch and as an audience,0.051226817
we might wonder why Brewster does not defend,0.07967934
his wife however bear in mind that his previous interactions with white men and the discrimination,0.5485915
he faces might have persuaded him that this is not a fight that he could win that even if he throws him out of his home he and Zelda might face consequences for that his social identity is the result of his disagreements with other people and his unwillingness to get involved as a result of his self reflection of who he is and what he can and cannot do after the incident,0.11561927
Zelda tells Brewster that he could never understand what it is like to be her,0.19324838
the implication that Brewster is not willing to understand what it is like to be a woman socialization shapes our ideas about what it means to be a man or a woman and the unequal relationship between these two identities Strickland sexually harasses Eliza at work we could say that he does this because he is a bad person and maybe he is but he is permitted to do this because many societies establish certain privileges in men,0.3535406
if Eliza complained there is a strong chance that the accusation would be dismissed as quickly as she would be dismissed from her job 20th century,0.073010266
philosopher Simone de Beauvoir once said thus Humanity is male and man defines woman not at herself but as relation to him she is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her,0.14842519
he is the subject,0.07054705
he is the absolute she is the other Strickland says that Eliza's inability to speak sexually arouses him,0.6907106
and when he has sex with his wife he places his hand over her mouth so that she cannot speak he enjoys the ability to shape the social identity of others,0.8060606
his references to the biblical Delilah is his way of expressing his feelings about female cunning and betrayal,0.24145475
it's his way of reminding Zelda a black woman of what he believes is her place the shape of water takes place during the Cold War in the 1950s the American government and the Soviet government do not have any specific use for the amphibian man outside of a brief discussion about the likelihood of his biology helping the space race the American general explicitly says that if the Soviets wanted that America wants it if the Soviets wanted they can't have it because the so it's must be up to no good his sole basis,0.33242175
for reasoning is that they are Soviets the shape of water shows not only a tolerance for the other,0.10710755
but also a love unlike in say Beauty,0.10941966
and the Beast the amphibian man does not need to transform into a human to receive a happy,0.26678482
ending movies generally present us with clear heroes,0.15388902
and villains in the film Strickland is the villain,0.2081577
he is the true monster of the shape of water movies and perhaps stories in general reinforce an individualistic worldview the idea that society is made up of individuals making independent choices and that your lot in life is primarily a result of your own actions irrelevant to the actions of others the individualistic model of the world posits that people do what they are and that injustice and impression are the result of the isolated actions of a fringe group of bad people like Strickland,0.35294488
but the truth is that the social systems that individuals create become more powerful than the individual as individual people we are always participating in these social systems,0.04742989
a family is a social system,0.035933778
a workplace is a social system when we meet people and either introduce ourselves or shake hands,0.053113315
we are participating in a social system when we interact with our employers,0.035616495
we are participating in a social system,0.03148587
and when we treat people a certain way based on their social identity,0.15094434
we are also participating in a social system it is,0.023423897
so inescapable that it has become ubiquitous,0.10980199
and therefore invisible we choose not to see it and choose,0.08777969
only to see the individual in a sense,0.09624394
the villain of the shape of water is not Strickland rather it is the institutions and systems,0.069412366
that affect the characters,0.08016653
the villain is racism sexism homophobia,0.47833556
etc,0.035887264
Strickland exhibits most of these traits,0.24851684
so he is more like the representative of these systems,0.06770577
and functions as the voice of the institution of uttering people because a film is told through and visuals rather than invisible systems of oppression to the credit of the shape of water,0.08142134
Strickland's motivations are related to his being in a system in this case the government's military and intelligence sectors,0.13734795
he complains to the general in individualistic terms Strickland says that he has proven himself time,0.09296461
and time again however the system does not care about that because it is bigger than the individual Strickland is portrayed as the villain of course and the audience is meant to root against him,0.097543284
but when many are confronted with the facts about other investments,0.04622732
some are quick to dismiss the concept become defensive miss the point and talk about personal responsibility instead or choose the path of least resistance,0.064785905
ignoring it as someone else's problem,0.124945976
that is how social systems and individuals interact individuals are not completely powerless though they can choose to walk away from the path of least resistance and actively fight,0.078099914
a systemic oppression despite the pressure from the social systems to conform the shape of water shows us an example of this,0.05470323
when Eliza turns on the television she and Joe see the 1950s civil rights movement,0.11959874
and suppression of these protests by the police Giles frustrated demands that Eliza turn it off,0.24094737
he can't stomach watching it,0.20583123
and instead prefers watching Bojangles an african-american performer not a protester Giles who is a gay man living in the 1950s must be careful about his interactions with other people his flirtation with the diner employee ends badly but it could have gone much worse for him,0.1796919
if the employee had decided to become violent however his sexuality is something that he can hide and therefore has a small luxury of not engaging Zelda,0.40026608
in contrast must take into account who she is speaking to in every situation in her life to protect herself from sexism and more violent forms of bigotry related to her race,0.36898357
Giles tries to make this someone else's problem,0.118792646
and exemplified by Eliza's request to help the amphibian man which he also rejects he eventually finds that he cannot take it,0.03170547
anymore seeing the diner employee reject him and then shoo away African Americans he realizes that hiding in the system men,0.40315142
ignoring,0.15996337
the problem is no way to live,0.13922475
and he helps Eliza rescue the amphibian man he even fights Strickland,0.1184882
it's easy to pretend sociological systems of oppression do not exist,0.28394303
sometimes they benefit us and we instinctively side with things that benefit us also because we would prefer to think of ourselves as individuals instead of existing within complex social systems that we do not entirely control and also because such systems are invisible until we witness them happening to ourselves,0.05533397
