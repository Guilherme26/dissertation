see the fact that this whoa is that the first time i'm hearing this with,0.10854197
headphones so that noise just zipped through my left ear that was insane that was,0.28635177
wild i don't know like that was that that spooked me a little bit yo,0.46367437
yo yo what's up everybody welcome back to another movie reaction and commentary today we're,0.0728503
going to be re-watching arrival now i'm really excited to kind of jump into this,0.24217917
one because it's been a minute since i've watched this to the point where i,0.07006831
kind of forget the main theme of this i know it has something to do,0.056356598
with aliens and like communication but i know there's like a twist at the end,0.091674134
that you know i think implements time travel or something like that um but yeah,0.10296869
i just remember being like really blown away primarily due to the cinematography as well,0.12257696
as just the direction that this movie decided to take and i'm really excited to,0.06379166
kind of rewatch that and provide some filmmaking aspects to things uh that can hopefully,0.08720736
bring value to you guys and also maybe clarify some things that maybe you hadn't,0.09560867
realized the first time or second time or however many times you've watched this film,0.10197819
so i'm really excited to kind of do this this is also starring amy adams,0.10412449
forest whitaker and jeremy renner um and we got the man the myth the legend,0.08823906
dennis the villain i'm not gonna call that i'm not gonna say his last day,0.24188411
because i know i'm a butch it up even though i know how to say,0.25415042
it i'm just not gonna even attempt it because knowing me i might butcher it,0.5154597
but on here we're gonna call him dennis the villain because he's villainous with the,0.20323452
camera and this dude knows how to direct movies he's just been killing it ever,0.711131
since i you know watched prisoners on here i'm really excited for i believe he's,0.14956583
doing dune as well too um blade runner 2049 was just incredible yeah i mean,0.1860804
he's he's on a roll in terms of just directing these incredible really deeply layered,0.09836752
films that you know encompass not only filmmaking and why filmmaking is great but also,0.13595329
it does justice to the overall story that he's presenting to the audience in general,0.055366144
and i think that's a perfect balance so i'm excited to kind of jump into,0.15858135
this when i kind of re-watch this and from the eyes of a filmmaker now,0.08890645
and just really just like you know be able to uh sit down and hopefully,0.24371263
bring some education to things that maybe you haven't known about like always guys the,0.08252444
best way to support the channel is through patreon but i get it now everybody,0.06585188

help out the channel just as much as well as let's say for instance you,0.08337512

thing you can do for yourself and for me is to just enjoy your time,0.10425891
as we watch or i should say re-watch arrival again guys if you want to,0.08913328
watch the full length definitely check out the patreon link below there you can sync,0.070049524
up your copy of the film with mine and enjoy all the commentary and laughs,0.10003517
and whatever the heck is in the freaking video that i don't put on youtube,0.7093121
you guys already know the drill yeah this scene hurts a lot because of knowing,0.11658169
the scene definitely holds new meaning now if i can remember correctly on uh what,0.042793956
exactly happened at the end of this film but also this is a kick-ass soundtrack,0.65149176
i've heard it multiple times too bad i can't play it for y'all but just,0.08223573
know it's like the it's like the sad soundtrack you guys know what it is,0.09847337
yeah again guys you know i would i mean this is definitely sci-fi i would,0.07857642
say in its own way you know storytelling is there are days that define yours,0.04342816
millions and trillions of ways to formulate a story so i would consider this sci-fi,0.23035008
but very psychological i love the the tackle of you know inner questions and things,0.14939417
or themes that you know really depend on the independent and how they affect the,0.03767822
outside world basically imagine this film being like imploding in on itself and then exploding,0.21224488
hold on i'm learning that more objects like this have landed ah it's so great,0.2585626
that they're keeping this frame on her face as the information is being told to,0.10429353
us without showing us what it is like that's so well done that's so well,0.11830072
done builds a lot of questions and it also builds this narrative it's really cool,0.047372468
i really relate to dennis and his way of you know storytelling because it's some,0.049294647
of the things that i would do the only ones to have one of these,0.12054779
in our backyard if this is some sort of peaceful first contact another thing too,0.1363706
that i really appreciate is the flow of information within this film i'm noticing it,0.08155252
now but just the audio uh that's outside of like you know our main source,0.06466301
here you know the dialogue is being almost transitional it's like a transition phase to,0.06591789
every scene so even though the scenes are changing the flow of information still keeps,0.10112223
the same pace which allows us to you know really piece together what the director,0.04489482
or you know the filmmaker wants us to know lady ain't nobody showing up the,0.069549665
class like there's aliens coming to earth no one is showing up to class you're,0.1783632
always going to have teachers like that it's the weirdest thing to me go home,0.11630836
like can you imagine someone coming into your your your workspace and saying can you,0.5685013
translate that and then proceed to like let you hear that it's like i i,0.06197995
don't even know where to start with that i don't even know what to even,0.19012633
begin with that tonight as russia and china join talks at the united nations meanwhile,0.122944295
financial markets across the world are in crisis as the dow jones industrial outlet if,0.05349553
any of you notice too there's a lot of blue like like the color blue,0.040557265
just literally radiating the film itself why i'm not too sure but i would love,0.07198437
to understand why blue seems to dominate a lot of the shot selections get here,0.10580624
are they capable faster than my travel i think you might have a i love,0.09261998
how realistic this film is man this film is just so damn realistic in its,0.65735
approach and how they decided to tackle this i would have loved to seen like,0.09676565
the conversation of tackling this film as realistic as possible i wonder if they talked,0.06887882
with anybody god what the hell man that shot is crazy dude with this music,0.72649974
in the background just damn it's so good it's so good i love it like,0.5154597
this is my speed to a t that sense of scale is wild wild what,0.21809873
a crazy cool way to just introduce that oval-shaped spaceship man i really love that,0.27225786
it's just super cloudy which is like the greatest thing at least for like uh,0.15029694
a cinematographer [Laughter] like just the the atmosphere the vibe that's weight down in a,0.07307987
lot of these shots because of just how it looks like i'm telling you guys,0.24056157
like the look of your film can really affect the story of your film every,0.14840001
aspect of filmmaking is important and that's why i tell you the best thing that,0.07553854
you could do as a filmmaker or anybody that's dealing with any piece of art,0.19798437
is to know the vibe that you want to cast not only for your audience,0.09823141
but for yourself yeah bro that sense of scale is just ridiculous it's one of,0.7093121
the reasons why i'm also really excited for dune too because that sense of scale,0.15265901
man like the scale is what is one of my favorites within this film like,0.15128338
just looking up and seeing this fortress of an identified floating object that's not from,0.0749072
our galaxy really that is wild that's crazy that's that's insane that's insane dawg that,0.5053359
sound is wild i don't even know how they did that doctor dude like what,0.31089434
they literally look like their hands are doing this bro like that's like dude that's,0.2177846
so cool like that's incredible man shout out to everyone who worked on this film,0.15617143
this is just such a surreal moment i don't know about y'all i get a,0.109102555
marine biologist in the building like this this sounds like wells communicating with each other,0.0654048
or some deep-sea creature communicating with each other they're using like vibrations like that's wild,0.23963602
set their compound ablaze their website claims the arrival of the aliens set in motion,0.098994285
of prophecy the 12 sets and it's not even just a race against time for,0.3503253
the aliens it's a race against time for like the people of the world because,0.4031629
we're just freaking out you know like everybody's freaking out because they don't know what,0.44571728
the heck is happening so the reason why i'm assuming that the military is like,0.4075395
hey we need to do this fast it's because everything is gonna you know everything,0.06965942
is just gonna fall apart bro that is so cool man that is so cool,0.16701816
man help me understand okay um i gotta say i'm so frustrated with forrest whitaker's,0.28125966
forrest whitaker's like questions but like i'm happy he is questioning it so that way,0.14769365
i can learn too but he is frustrating my thing is like you can't see,0.1888337
the top of their bodies like it's it's forever in mystery you don't exactly know,0.12500241
how big they are or what the finished product of their body even looks like,0.24188428
they're like weird octopus that are blind it's really strange and i love it that,0.18486097
is wild man i love that that's so cool bro that's so cool damn i,0.70258856
love sci-fi man it's so dope see the fact that this whoa it's like the,0.25658584
first time i'm hearing this with headphones so that noise just zipped through my left,0.09814912
ear that was insane that was wild i don't know like that was that that,0.19385104
spooked me a little bit unlike all written humanly it's like teaching an infant the,0.18248484
dictionary through painting that's literally what it is i only say infant because you know,0.23437335
they don't know the language so imagine trying to teach an infant the human dictionary,0.39335144
through like i don't know pollock paintings you would have to know each word you,0.26126662
wanted to use as well as how much space that it would occupy such a,0.07131129
brilliant a brilliant way to tell that like that's just so good what's this word,0.06522084
yeah i if you were to tell me that there would be a correlation between,0.07638507
a grieving mother who's lost their child and extraterrestrial aliens i'd be like okay it's,0.4033887
just it's incredible that it makes sense off her weapon wow oh god god that's,0.2412998
ah yeah that would definitely bring some uh some tension action prevails there's no evidence,0.06851631
of that sure there is let's grab a history book the british with india the,0.11102815
germans with rwanda yeah but that's human like that's human that's so weird to bring,0.5024878
up history when you're dealing with aliens especially when you don't know what they are,0.15156825
and their communication is vastly different that's the one thing man that it frustrated me,0.12462451
when i first watched this is people's just like oh yeah well history it's only,0.08916087
been humans it's human history like what and there would be idiots like this there,0.85609066
will be idiots like this just stupid dumb not know how to do their job,0.94992846
idiots oh god that's so annoying oh snap i think it's tapping it because it's,0.9017225
like yo there is a bomb in our ship brett go get that thing it's,0.33265144
like hey so like i know all over time dimension there's a bomb in our,0.26567507
ship you should get that damn i think this was when it clicked for me,0.77403057
when i first watched it i was like oh yeah these dudes are like other,0.13159515
dimension like they know how to like what with uh ian said being able to,0.099511005
know a beginning and middle a beginning and ending of a sentence is basically that,0.09736746
but just with time wow dude i can't believe i don't remember this part what,0.06823511
the heck that's crazy yo said the aliens have 24 hours to leave chinese territory,0.60515773
or face destruction and he urged all other world i hate how like realistic how,0.48794198
realistic this would be like it's so stupid it's so stupid man i'm just like,0.8355208
why don't you just let people do their jobs i don't know but like whatever,0.24010216
stop focusing on the ones look at the zeros how much of this is data,0.10752377
how much of it is negative space yup and this is where the dimensions come,0.10468738
in man they're in a whole different dimension speaking in 5d basically they are speaking,0.04987319
in five-dimensional i don't even know what that looked like so i don't even know,0.15074578
what how that even would i can't even fathom that what trade it's a non-zero,0.10963169
sum game non-zero sum game oh my god everything is freaking connected bro what yo,0.5154597
it's ah dude time and sci-fi there's so much out there that's just so interesting,0.06985575
to me i'm so happy this film exists i've never seen anything like it i'm,0.117067136
not sure if it was like originally a book or whatnot but so interesting yeah,0.053996246
at that point it's it's destined to be her like you just know that it's,0.13215016
destined to be heard this is so bizarre man i love it god that is,0.15511207
just so awesome man just so many questions are just in my brain right now,0.22394738
so many visually how do you capture something like this you know like man the,0.12133151
visuals in this are just beyond anything yo yo that's that's that's i can't fathom,0.13144688
that how do they design that oh that's so intriguing this is so cool man,0.09528811
this is so dope [Laughter] oh yeah i mean i'll be i'd be crapping my,0.5570165
pants tremendously though who's this child yep and then that's where it clicks she didn't,0.10340456
even have a kid yet right imagine imagine trying to put that and wrap it,0.10038683
around your stupid three-dimensional human mind like how do how does one do that how,0.8785311
does one do that it's my fault i told him something that he wasn't ready,0.14922427
to hear oh it clicks now i unders i i'm getting where i left off,0.11141934
from when i first watched this yeah got you that's why he left it's ian,0.07672726
by the way she basically was like hey dude um our tartar is gonna die,0.6447799
from cancer and your poetry and all the other amazing things that you share with,0.42726928
the world i am unstoppable oh that's crazy like i literally was telling y'all someone,0.5592065
came up to me and said yeah this film is about you know a person,0.110487714
you know losing their daughter and then aliens and then connected would you guys have,0.21746892
thought that this would be one of the ways it reads the same forward from,0.06276929
beginning and end all right that's no it's clicking i don't know i think i,0.11792085
clicked this when i first watched this but i can't remember me like getting it,0.09409087
but i'm like re-clicking things and i'm like damn it's basically like trying to it's,0.5227885
like you realizing you've already lived and picking up the pieces from where you've left,0.11117994
off i'm not sure if that's like a good way to remember but that's basically,0.084079616
what i'm feeling like that's it's like it's like imagine yourself already have lived years,0.14217597
like you're in the future but you just don't know it until now and like,0.14905916
your memories start kicking in like deja vu from the future i believe it was,0.31089434
important for you to see that um i called you didn't i yes you did,0.10215936
wow wow dude that's insane like what the heck it's like memento but like just,0.6981272
like like if if you told the story of memento in a five-dimensional level how,0.062782735
i i don't know ah the music building is just oh my god it's like,0.13105698
it's so good man it's so good wow like i'm getting a lot of christopher,0.15345837
nolan vibes from that too because it's dealing with time you know which is a,0.096641734
very commendable thing gone disappeared thin air dude that's just like this is just like,0.14193359
probably one of my favorite portrayals of just communicating with aliens that i've seen in,0.12482329
a while a very long time this was a commendable film and the whole time,0.08713294
she knows that's what hurts man like she knows that is just brutal man it's,0.4734
brutal but she saved everyone you know what surprised me the most that wasn't meeting,0.12327131
them is meeting you damn that line hurts so bad that line hits man damn,0.8373695
man dude i mean again guys this part's probably muted for y'all but like the,0.15829815
feels the emotions and the fact that she's aware of it all you know just,0.08104006
make sure just appreciate it even more yeah guys and that is the end of,0.07418217
arrival all right everybody we just got done finishing up our re-watching of arrival and,0.17910302
man i'm so happy i rewatched this because i just i appreciate it just through,0.10507395
the roof to the moon and back on my second time and just you know,0.07270012
having a better understanding of what was really being you know showcased as on top,0.058969937
of like the beautiful cinematography and the pacing of this film i think this film,0.11781385
is just excellent it's a plus material not only have i've never seen anything like,0.11653316
i mean anything quite like it this takes just sci-fi to a whole new meaning,0.09104296
a lot of the times we think of sci-fi as this you know action adventure,0.054300867
um you know just journey of the universe and it 100 is but that's just,0.0425183
one out of the trillions and infinite possibilities where you could take sci-fi and i,0.08563083
remember this comment that i remember reading on one of our sci-fi videos that we,0.09388972
watched i i don't know what video it was but you know they said that,0.09519829
oh yeah actually sci-fi is something that's already been tapped into you know you can't,0.09505383
really do anything more with it it's actually being worn out and then you have,0.13339442
films like arrival coming in and saying nah nah you guys were just dealing with,0.13396217
all the action what about communicating what about that and incorporating it with psychological storytelling,0.08974494
that is very personal and implementing time travel in a way or like time uh,0.059567116
dimensions all of that and then even better the alien designs what like it was,0.12607457
just so haunting but like there was this gentle abstraction to them their designs were,0.1012679
just so so real it's it's it's quite interesting to say that because again this,0.056841932
is imagination this is purely imagination but it was really grounded with reality not even,0.10163167
just on how humans would react but just aliens that's incredible that's super awesome so,0.13727537
guys let me know what your thoughts are in the comments below i would love,0.17167006
to hear them especially for this film like always guys stay healthy and stay hydrated,0.13016912
because we are just getting started purple jacket pocket full of wheat everything that i,0.06204874
should ever need grab some matches cause they give em free just like my time,0.1542303
