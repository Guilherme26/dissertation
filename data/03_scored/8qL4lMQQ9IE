[Applause] starwars the last Jedi was directed by Rian Johnson and stars a whole bunch,0.055331513
of people and porks and it's about Rafe in Poe Luke Leia kylo and a,0.24065639
whole bunch of Star Wars folk on a big adventure and that's all I'm gonna,0.16378614
say you should just go see it I'm not saying anything else joking aside if,0.13292086
you saw the force awakens you know that it quite literally ended with a cliffhanger,0.17921862
Rey extending that lightsaber out to Luke and us wondering what he's gonna do with,0.05125924
it this film answers that question and a lot of other questions and has a,0.052755278
lot of fun doing it and I had a blast watching the last Jedi this,0.12961157
is a really really damn entertaining Star Wars movie and one with a unique voice,0.604956
Brian Johnson is able to direct this film and please I'm sure the vast majority,0.102769636
of Star Wars fans but his voice is not lost in the shuffle I've seen,0.2420816
all of his films I've been a fan of his ever since brick that was,0.18689644
one of the very first movies on my channel that I gave an A+ to,0.047628995
my highest rating the vision that he has shown in films like brick and looper,0.13873707
and even the Brothers Bloom is very much so present here he has a great,0.062845804
knack for filming terrific action sequences and his voice and his humor are ever-present in,0.12767342
this film it's a very funny movie just like the force awakens was a lot,0.10727894
of great jokes and none of them feel like they're at the expense of the,0.074625686
characters it doesn't feel like they're referencing things either just to reference them sure there,0.02652947
are winks and nods and references but to ask the eighth film in a saga,0.05746006
to act like the others didn't even exist I think is unfair but the fanservice,0.15112966
in the last Jedi does not come at an expense to the story it doesn't,0.05182581
feel like a throwaway moment like in rogue one where we saw at c-3po just,0.11793332
going oh yes I'm in this movie because I'm in every Star Wars movie and,0.085917965
we couldn't have it not be in this it doesn't feel like the fanservice in,0.06433605
the last Jedi is there because oh yeah I remember that Star Wars thing Johnson's,0.058127034
love for Star Wars and for these characters shines through but also ways that he,0.07148458
questions certain things that have become established in star wars I'll talk more about this,0.08155759
in my spoiler review but the film does bring up things about previous Star Wars,0.052860245
stories and asks questions that I think people walking into this universe like our new,0.058433972
characters would logically want to know about and the film has a surprising way of,0.041545123
exploring these questions let's talk a little bit about the performances Daisy Ridley once again,0.09846994
is proving to be an excellent choice as Rey she's terrific in the action sequences,0.08006567
and the dramatic stuff she's an incredible actress John boyega once again amazing his fin,0.18129446
oh boy let's talk about Carrie Fisher this was tough this was really hard for,0.06063672
me actually because she was kind of a childhood hero of mine and of course,0.37667978
when she passed away this was one of the the real celebrity deaths that actually,0.18408851
kind of affected me and it was it was tough seeing her in this film,0.16717826
but I think they did a great job with her character and it has some,0.06906487
truly satisfying moments and it was just it was really nice to see her on,0.15533198
screen and she was great in this movie Mark Hamill is the best he has,0.089604996
ever been has Luke Skywalker and this is easily his best performance he is magnificent,0.13117184
in this film every single scene with him was awesome he was really really good,0.110710144
this is a character as I said dealing with quite a bit obviously he has,0.1946596
secluded himself on this island and so some history has led to that and the,0.088138275
exploration of that in this film was wonderful Hamill you really knocked it out of,0.23971474
the park you gave me everything I wanted in a Luke Skywalker and everything I,0.1316473
didn't know I wanted I'm sure has a lot of you know he has said,0.09276854
that he was kind of surprised by the direction Rian Johnson took and I can,0.052635085
see why and it definitely paid off I think this is a very unique vision,0.10420085
and that's what I'll say for now until the spoiler review this is definitely definitely,0.040138666
different when it comes to his character Johnson has also done something with the action,0.046962615
sequences in particular anything involving a lightsaber that I have wanted for ever my favorite,0.06280051
shots any lightsaber battles are always the head-to-toe wides the beautiful grand master shots that,0.41578668
feature our heroes and you can see their entire body the choreography and it just,0.07904616
feels incredibly epic the lightsaber sequences in this film have some of the most beautiful,0.07624486
wide shots I have ever seen it's very apparent how much Ryan Johnson has been,0.1509495
inspired by Japanese films by samurai films anime it all feels very much so like,0.06159278
the Jedi are almost samurai and if I'm wrong and that wasn't what he was,0.08324359
going for that's what I saw and some of the imagery here is gorgeous the,0.07436296
action sequences are some of my favorite that I've seen in a Star Wars movie,0.049726743
they're really really good Adam driver as kylo Ren continues to be very compelling a,0.09321028
terrific performance he and force awakens I thought was a very conflicted and deep character,0.13554373
not your average villain he wasn't done yet he wasn't fully trained he wasn't ready,0.27512208
he had angry deep-seated emotion that really shone through in his work and he is,0.10957299
amazing here and this film continues to deepen kylo ren's legacy in ways that I,0.059864312
cannot wait to talk about in the spoiler review really satisfied with everything they did,0.062087312
in this movie with every major character Oscar Isaac is once again amazing as PO,0.10246225
such a likable presence let's talk about Finn and Rose because this leads me into,0.15471236
my issues with the last Jedi there's a storyline here that involves these characters Finn,0.08264953
and Rose that feels like an extended short film almost like the movie just stops,0.09851492
and becomes something else something else I didn't really enjoy all that much it's a,0.07020419
sequence on another world that feels almost too much like Earth this place they go,0.07715147
just did not feel like a galaxy far far away it felt like a place,0.12823898
you might see here on earth just with a few more exotic creatures but it,0.20389852
wasn't just the setting it was the fact that it basically screeched the story to,0.054226354
a halt and every time it cut back to them I was like okay is,0.17782734
this gonna get more interesting here is this gonna get better reminded me of in,0.075730145
the Phantom Menace documentary when George Lucas had just seen The Phantom Menace for the,0.05011118
first time and you see him sitting there in the theater agonizing over the fact,0.16671914
that he can't remove anything because it all connects and he's just kind of like,0.098987125
oh boy well Rick what do we do I can't really remove any of that,0.14091724
stuff because they're all kind of you know interweaves oh boy you know a special,0.2611681
effect without a story is a pretty boring thing Rick you know oh boy Jar,0.16212825
Jar is the key to all of this jokes aside this sequence with Finn and,0.08519621
Rose it's just too far along and the things that they have to do sure,0.03463443
it effects the plot later but they're just should have been an easier and quicker,0.10745792
way to do some of these things because it feels like a detour an unnecessary,0.13532656
detour it reminded me of in Avengers age of Ultron when Thor goes off looking,0.091279164
for that pool you're just like what all right unfortunately this sequence is necessary to,0.24176942
set up some things that you're supposed to care about later and I just didn't,0.07889034
we'll talk more about that in the spoiler review but that is my one major,0.053670682
issue with the last Jedi that 20 to 30 minutes that are combined this Finn,0.14925559
storyline now obviously it's not just a 30 minute chunk of the movie it's spread,0.07306024
out over the film but it's one of those things like I said where you're,0.053217348
going back to this place and you're like yeah this could be better pushing all,0.2746223
that aside I honestly love the last Jedi I had a really great time with,0.06486235
this movie I think it has some of the best action sequences in the entire,0.06127023
saga it has some of the best performances in the entire saga it has a,0.059994016
compelling and conflicted villain and it has tons of surprises there are a lot of,0.12651071
things that happen I did not expect I'm not the type of person who likes,0.10314311
to go in speculating though so that could be different for you I don't like,0.09212908
to sit here and make up theories and guess and try to predict things I,0.089268014
like to go in just like I can't wait to experience this I also like,0.07022027
John Williams score this time around more than I did for the force awakens his,0.055081543
music of course is always going to be really good but his score for the,0.08254423
force away was one of my least favorites it just felt a little rushed this,0.12144437
one feels better it's like he had more time let's talk about porks real quick,0.1923912
they're adorable they're amazing and they're not annoying thank God captain tarpals never forget bb-8,0.14907989
once again has a lot of moments to shine Chewie does as well as does,0.07222128
the Millennium Falcon some really awesome Millennium Falcon sequences I honestly love this film I,0.06464121
don't know about where it stands for me but the force awakens I want to,0.08869613
see it again let me see it this Thursday we'll do a spoiler review after,0.07242309
that I think I'll be able to give you my official ranking of where this,0.067414545
fits in but it is a damn good Star Wars movie there are a lot,0.47468066
of emotional moments that I am looking forward to talking to you more about in,0.090472855
the spoiler review if this review seems a little vague it's because I feel like,0.09636459
that's what you would prefer we'll talk more about that after the film is released,0.042255837
but rest assured this movie made me really happy I'm gonna give the last Jedi,0.081259966
and a - definitely better than rogue one I had characters that I actually cared,0.113994576
about a story that felt like it was beginning middle and end made by one,0.075421594
person it didn't feel like an assembly line product it didn't feel like another movie,0.067428924
we've already seen it's structurally its own thing sure there are a few little beats,0.08589873
here and there where you might be like I've seen that before I've seen that,0.067561254
before but this is definitely made by somebody with a unique voice Rian Johnson and,0.0772098
I think he did a damn good job I'm looking forward to seeing it again,0.54500264
I can't wait for you guys to see it thank you so much as always,0.11187708
