so I just drove three hours total to see a three and a half hour movie in the theater,0.0747585
so that's six and a half hours of my time was it worth it,0.11757616
what does that flick fans and welcome back to my channel today we're talking about the brand new Netflix original film the Irishman this thing drops on Netflix on the 27th,0.06689496
I fortunately found a theater that was semi closed to me and I said you know what I'm going today,0.05753335
we're going to talk about it,0.05535673
let me know in the comments are you a fan of Martin Scorsese and were you excited for this film let's talk about it so world war ii veteran and mob hitman Frank the Irishman Sheeran recalls his possible involvement with the story of union leader Jimmy Hoffa in honesty time I love Martin Scorsese one of the best directors clearly working right now and some of the best actors of all time in this movie together,0.24042693
I was excited for this film but not as excited as some others because I was um I was nervously hesitant because of the integration of this D aging technology and the fact that this film is so long,0.09339895
it's going to Netflix there were just so many things that we're making me nervous,0.08950592
and I saw the trailer and I really liked the trailer but I'm like huh I'm just I'm not excited as I should be once again Martin Scorsese Robert DeNiro Al Pacino ha Joe Pesci Harvey Keitel oh my good go on for days,0.091412835
Bobby Cannavale II Ray Romano,0.09154966
everyone is in this film and it is a movie that is very long like I said three and a half hours actually past that especially if you are like me and you're just sitting through the credits go on you just gotta take a breath after a movie like this,0.118456066
because it really knocks the breath out of you,0.25588253
this is the story of one man's entire life not necessarily from beginning to end,0.08935117
but it focuses on the reflection of Frank's life what he did to build up to that integral moment in the film and then the aftermath right,0.03883881
it's not just boom and the movies over no we get time to sit and breathe,0.123535015
and really think about what just happened,0.058797713
it feels like every time we get an intense moment,0.08174072
and trust me some of the most intense moments you will see all year are in this film,0.07917686
we get chance to reflect upon it think about it for five to ten minutes with our characters,0.060312662
and let me tell you guys the acting in this movie is as good as you were anticipating it to be Robert De Niro is fantastic,0.12514961
Joe Pesci,0.065787956
he's back,0.07268528
it's so good to see him back playing a very different character normally or most of the time when people think of Joe Pesci and a Martin Scorsese movie they think of the exaggerated and over-the-top character that's what Al Pacino gives us in this film which is similar to what he normally does,0.060522854
but Pesci plays a very more subdued character,0.1499562
he's kind of the guy in charge this time and everything runs through him and I really like seeing that side of him not that we're going to see him again in the future,0.15017934
because he's been out of the game for a while he came back for this film,0.16058545
and oh my gosh does he not absolutely kill it,0.73099357
so those two actors were on top of their game,0.112114124
but my favorite performance may actually be Al Pacino even though he is playing a similar character to what we've seen him play before Jimmy Hoffa is a different person with different intentions in this guy man any time,0.07811331
he gets let off of his leash,0.2716067
he goes crazy he talks so much in this movie and he's always talking people out of how they feel and talking them back into how he feels,0.5876557
that's just the kind of guy that Jimmy Hoffa is and they even say in the movie not a lot of young kids are going to know who Jimmy Hoffa is after this film if you all get the opportunity to see it even if it is on Netflix not on a big screen everyone know who Jimmy Hoffa is because Al Pacino is phenomenal in this movie just incredible,0.07606204
and Scorsese's Direction is as good as you anticipate it to be now it is a different feeling film it even looks different from his previous more recent efforts,0.062427547
you compare this to something like wolf of wallstreet it's like wolf of wallstreet has a very specific color palette and has a very specific over-the-top exaggerated look to it,0.08911687
I love that movie so much this is very different,0.0673753
this is a movie starring older gentleman,0.115435466
it's not necessarily going to be for the young crowd if they just look at it watch five minutes ago it's not for me,0.0699609
give this film a chance because even though this is a movie intended for the older crowd or intended for Scorsese fans like myself,0.100177735
I think everyone can get something out of this film even if you don't relate to our main character in Frank who does you know make mistakes in his life,0.09174647
and then at the end of the film he is reflecting upon this and saying what did I do wrong,0.08878503
and I love the way that this story is told I love how they go about his relationship with his daughter even though they don't flesh it out in the manner even from what I'm saying you expect them to flesh it out but they do it very very subtly,0.14611316
now if I have one complaint about that story it's the fact that Anna Paquin who plays his daughter,0.10206829
the older version did not get a lot of screen time with De Niro,0.066948086
now there is a reason for that,0.05530485
but I could have used more with that story,0.035633005
maybe just one conversation or one moment with her to speak a bit more because we did not get a lot from her but that storyline was integral because you continuously feel how he feels those looks just those really subtle moments that he's giving his daughter all throughout the movie you feel that,0.076874636
and that's what I'll say about this film it makes you feel,0.10467031
it makes you reflect even if you're not that age and we'll talk about the de-aging here in just a second you're thinking about your entire life,0.25448734
this movie makes you think about death and the consequences of death not a spoiler it's a mob movie but it's a very different mob movie a lot of people are going to compare this to Goodfellas maybe before they see the film and it's an understandable comparison because they are two mob based movies with someone kind of telling us the story as we go along in a non expositional way it's important exposition,0.13434549
there is a difference between bad exposition and good exposition,0.085112
and this was very necessary for this story,0.05117176
but they're two very different films this one's more subdued,0.11962712
but when the violence happens oh man does it happen and the way that it's filmed every single time,0.113061674
it's just so shocking,0.101716086
and we talked about the intense moments,0.05091683
and there's one scene in particular and oh my gosh man edge of my seat we're already so far into the film it's already been the span of what two other movies combined would be,0.14866751
and I'm still locked in I'm still focused because of the way score says he tells the story and it's also funny in the same way that Goodfellas was funny the unexpected humor there are some lines of dialogue and that are just hilarious from the smoke breaks that they have to take for their wives on their road trip to the way that Jimmy Hoffa gets frustrated because a guy shows up to a meeting in shorts and 15 minutes late it's just constantly throughout the movie you're sad you're intrigued you're a bit upset you're curious as to what is going to happen next and then you're laughing,0.1436055
it's everything that you want in a theatrical experience,0.11627226
now to the d aging,0.09573001
there are some moments in here first,0.042446062
sure where you're gonna look at it go,0.0710666
I I don't know if that was perfect and yes it has to do more with the CGI,0.15065986
but I think it's more of the fact that you are D,0.1846749
aging the face of course but you're putting that face on the body now they're obviously going to the hands and stuff too but on the body of a person who is a bit older,0.5154597
so even though they look younger when they start to walk they're a bit slouched and they walk like an older person and that's nothing against an arrow,0.32673934
it's nothing against Pacino,0.10298488
but you could just kind of tell every now and then that he's obviously not that young and I had trouble at moments trying to figure out what age he actually was but I do have to give kudos because the de-aging is so subtle at points that I didn't even notice it,0.09958418
and after about 10 minutes of watching this with a really long runtime,0.12223729
you don't care anymore because you're so locked into the story and you want him to keep going back throughout the years and tell more of his relationship with Russell of his relationship with Hoffa and De Niro is so captivating,0.24168497
I mean obviously the best performances any of these guys have given in quite some time Ray Romano as well and I know I mentioned him before but I was just shocked at how subdued everyone was in this movie and then delivering on the jokes when they had to and a lot of people are going to ask since this reached the heights the level of what a Goodfellas did it's a very different film that movie focused,0.080791965
on one thing this film focuses on morality and legacy and what did my life mean in the grand scheme of things,0.05295261
and how do I handle the passing of time,0.0614629
there are moments throughout the film where people start to not recognize those that have passed away a long time ago man and it makes you ask yourself these questions too it's like,0.0534934
what does it all mean and all of this from another Scorsese,0.06872061
my movie this film was epic,0.12355359
I'm gonna encourage everybody to watch this seek it out in theaters but don't worry if you can't find it in theaters,0.081057236
it's coming on Netflix like,0.063413076
I said,0.051518872
now it may be may be difficult because I feel like a lot of people are going to try to split this film up into like episodes because it's so long and I encourage you do not do that sit there locked in get some surround sound or whatever you need to do to get invested to get locked into these stories and I promise you it will be worth it,0.112636015
and I hope it will captivate you,0.4033327
I need to see the film again for sure because even though it flew by I do think it was a tad bit too long and like I said I did question some of the D aging effects,0.08091196
otherwise I just I was so sucked into this film I have to go really high with my score,0.5062228

my next video will most likely be a box office breakdown,0.09009063
