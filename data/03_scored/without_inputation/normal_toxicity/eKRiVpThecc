Jordan peels horror follow-up to get out has finally arrived US is genuinely scary,0.19377407
but does the story pack a punch or does it peter out we meet a family who is going on vacation in Santa Cruz to the mom's childhood home and they encounter a group of doppelgangers who just begin this night of terror,0.2623273
first,0.04585904
let's not compare this to get out,0.1518009
I mean this is its own unique story,0.055801507
it's not a sequel by any means,0.110874295
so to really compare it in that way or to treat it,0.085855134
as like hey this is get out part two,0.094324574
it's totally unfair the acting in this is phenomenal Lupita,0.15543152
Nyong'o plays Adelaide who is the mom and red who is the doppelganger,0.15193543
she is awesome at both because what she does is she plays them,0.090859696
so differently that they are their own standalone person with all of the unique traits and just nuances to that,0.24803092
but she plays them as the same character as well so that you can truly be a doppelganger and you see that they also share slight mannerisms here and there and oh my gosh what she does with her voice,0.114984386
as the doppelganger is just downright creepy and weird,0.356343
I mean you have to strain to listen to it a little bit because it's kind of like this inhalation talking and it's it rises and falls and just as scratchy and then is barely audible and then as fierce and and powerful and Wow I mean standout performance in this,0.085226886
she is spectacular Winston Duke is gave the dad and he is awesome too because what he does is bring,0.17434084
some comedic relief to the story,0.057535447
but that's not to say that he's like some doofus or he's a or a fool because he's not I mean he is strong,0.8322059
he is smart,0.13021144
and I just love though that he is full-on dad joke,0.21665168
I mean when he he's full of them,0.17963997
he just brings him and he commits to them,0.0971817
and you see the kids roll their eyes and even the wife rolls her eyes and me as a dad I'm like yeah that was awesome,0.28155786
I totally get that the kids in this are great too,0.1080784
I mean they are smart they are aware and their doppelgangers whoa those things just need to go,0.16479729
I mean it is Sain Zhora the girl her double has this smile to it that is just terrifying really I mean if there is something so not right about it,0.24234588
she just kind of her head a little bit and then has this and I can't even do it,0.4918276
justice by any means I mean she was awesome at that and the boy is just I as he crawls around,0.16721494
as the doppelganger,0.06654822
I mean he's got this mask on,0.15504627
and he's he's almost like animal-like,0.36050248
and it just the whole the whole imagery and their mannerisms and their movements are just oh not right Elizabeth moss,0.20484383
and Tim Heidecker are also in this but honestly they're barely in it,0.09268437
I mean they are such small minor roles,0.22114845
they're fine at what they do but they're pretty insignificant really Pele has really created an atmosphere of creep in us,0.49082634
I mean he is patient with his shots without belaboring anything,0.272099
I mean he knows when to sit on something and when to pull off and when to move it and some of the tracking and just the slowness and the patience to do certain things,0.09929782
and then some quick movements when it's called for that also,0.062112156
so just the the differences in all of his shot choices,0.15855435
and even the way that he frames different thing in different areas of the film just really draw you in and they just they like hyper focus you and then you had this soundtrack in this score really it's more of the score that is off-putting and it messes with your mind,0.10293205
and it sets up this tone of just creepiness and not full on terror,0.36694735
but you know that something is coming and you don't know what it is but you're pretty sure you're not gonna like it,0.26941377
the story in us is really layered and complex,0.053877942
I mean yes on its surface,0.09468998
it is a horror psychological thriller movie and it is digestible,0.17999326
and it is accessible by everybody but I know that Peale did not just make a straight-on horror film just like in get out I mean he had a horror and a psychological thriller in that but he was also making a point in us he's also making a point and I'm I'm gonna get into that right,0.16643696
now in this video but it's definitely see it multiple times,0.10748871
I mean I'm going to see it in just a couple days again because I want to catch things that I missed the film opens in 1986 in Santa Cruz and the thing it kept running through my mind is well really two things first off Santa Cruz in the mid 80s was not a place to be,0.08195596
and then I kept expecting to see Kiefer Sutherland and Corey Haim on the boardwalk someplace and if you don't understand what I'm talking about,0.11560678
and you don't get that then just go look it up and then it'll make a little bit of sense,0.11410091
it's not very funny but don't at least make sense,0.12055381
I had a blast with us,0.095918424
I mean Jordan Peele has solidified his horror director writes in my mind,0.4082618
this is a spectacular film and you know once is a fluke doing it twice that shows some real talent and skill if you like psychological horrors or thrillers then you're definitely gonna want to check this out there is no sex or nudity,0.48869145
but there is a lot of profanity and a lot of violence I give us 5 out of 5 couches,0.16701373
what's the scariest movie you've seen recently,0.24207744
