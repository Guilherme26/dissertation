realities but I've never liked it with spider-man but here rapt attention I think my,0.076434255
favorite thing about the movie is that it takes itself so seriously I mean it's,0.028221082
animated so it can be highly stylized and closer to its comic-book roots right from,0.043449797
the get-go and you even see the way this movie opens with the credits you'll,0.04318106
be like I think I'm in for something special and you are but it's very,0.03866779
much still it seems very much like a live-action movie you've been hoping for in,0.057331514
terms we know when it comes to the evolution of animation but I'm talking about,0.025636842
scope depth action scenes and what's at stake this is the Beauty and the Beast,0.14334507
of superhero animated movies I'm also in awe of this movie's authenticity this is Miles,0.032231472
Morales this is Peter Parker Spider Gwen but it's also miles this extended family such,0.016772605
great characters Kington Aunt May and well there are some surprises here yes while the,0.012227406

online and I checked my invitation and even Sony didn't provide it whoa this is,0.018512726
a long movie but in like in a really good way where you're like I,0.08646922
can't believe we'll be still going I never want it to end keep going keep,0.03063836
going yes give me more I really I hope hope they're working on the sequel,0.14075552
right now although I have another idea which we'll talk about in just a moment,0.019205848
but for those of you first of all worried about getting miles just right oh,0.022598948
boy do they he even speaks Spanish for instance I know a number of you,0.03861524
were worried about that but most importantly he feels is real and unique as he,0.013642916
did when he was first introduced in the comics because in the comics recently and,0.021273904
I think this has to do with Brian Michael Bendis his attention being drawn elsewhere,0.060998004
first within Marvel and then leaving for DC but miles has lost his way as,0.022145294
a character over the past couple of years I've bought every single one of his,0.03229799
comics always enjoyed them even though it's been waning a little bit recently and I'm,0.06496117
hoping that this movie reminds Marvel and Sony what a great and valuable character he,0.055820215
is I would love to see shameik Moore very talented actor should meet more fans,0.09701038
since um since dope but he does the voice of Miles Morales and I would,0.044060435
love to see him appear alongside Tom Holland in a future live-action spider-man movie and,0.04197242
you know I'd actually say the same for Hailee Steinfeld who I don't usually enjoy,0.052454386
but she is perfectly cast as spider-gwen I really liked her too come to think,0.09381151
of it they animated these characters to look a little bit like the actors so,0.03865249
they could do it they could jump to the live-action but there will always be,0.049628023
a special place in my heart for Jake Johnson spider-man I have waited so long,0.05645214
for an adult spider-man to appear on screen and it was worth the wait he,0.037124563
is perfect I also want to warn you at the beginning of the movie like,0.073236056
myself you might be like where's Jake Johnson's voice did they cast a different voice,0.025771875
don't worry he's coming it's just part of a twist in a movie full of,0.062296443
twists then as I said truly true believer best Stan Lee cameo ever no shirt,0.023839517
to be fair coming right after his tragic passing it does pull on the old,0.051105395
heartstrings just a bit harder but I still think even if you take that element,0.080636226
away it's the best Stan Lee cameo because I think for one it's associated with,0.03204855
spider-man the character he's the most associated with and then he's given such a wonderful,0.029917965
line that he says to Miles Morales it's like almost as good as the one,0.028670745
he wrote for spider-man in the comics with great power comes great responsibility and I,0.039662905
think it even plays on that a little bit it was just it perfectly captured,0.03297914
Stan Lee and on that note this is a really well-written movie so kudos to,0.022076115
