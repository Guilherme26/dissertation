hi I'm Andre and I'm a black nerd nice to see you again on my,0.48481917
channel and a special shout-out to my subscribers you asked me to review the movie,0.04489391
get out which I actually saw a couple weeks ago they had a special influencer,0.07741939
screening but it was really cool the cast was there Jordan Peele key and Peele,0.022103388
Fame who wrote and directed this movie was their chance the rapper was hosting the,0.012517426
Q&A so that's different that's pretty cool but yeah it was a little cool event,0.015325831
and it was nice to see the people whatever but it's all about the movie,0.044607215
right I saw the movie I got to talk about it right now to you,0.047478147
let's talk about this movie here's the thing about this review those be a little,0.0311878
bit different than what I usually do usually I'm like here's good bad very and,0.10236178
here's some clips and here's some plot point if any other mm-hmm I don't do,0.03000976
any of that I won't going to keep this as as big and simplified while,0.074660875
still giving you my thoughts and what I possibly can and the reason for that,0.036021024
is I don't want to spoil this in any kind of way I think this,0.042535834
is one of those movies that you got to go in knowing probably as little,0.027383614
as you possibly can to really fully experience and enjoy it so this is it,0.028419971
this photo you see back here that's all I get all right I'll put the,0.04643115
the logo of the title of the movie boom get out that's it only thing,0.032153647
you need to know about the plot is that there's a couple Chris Andros Chris,0.015875272
happens to be black Rose happens to be white they're going home to the countryside,0.27360845
to our Paris house to meet her family obviously her family is white he's is,0.27167058
black guy in a different location with all these family members and something's happens some,0.25286096
of its suspenseful some of its horror some of his race-related so it is a,0.20939316
blend of all of it but that's all you need to know so uh yeah,0.09152262
man I really enjoyed this movie I am NOT a huge horror person like I,0.15846005
don't really go see a lot of horror movies in theaters and lately some of,0.04626685
the horror films have kind of followed a similar formula that just come in to,0.030323062
go and so it was nice to go see this one and really get into,0.043308113
it and what's interesting about this movie is it's or suspense then hearth it reminds,0.03308158
me a lot of 10 Cloverfield Lane not necessarily in the actual premise but just,0.008060031
in the feeling of it which with another movie that was much more enjoyable not,0.021007165
knowing anything going into it as opposed to being told a lot about it before,0.028743915
going in I saw 10 Cloverfield Lane like the weekend it open mainly because I,0.03143791
didn't want anything spoiled about it and really enjoyed it as a result and the,0.03649996
same way I feel about this one but as far as there are similarities as,0.015428934
far as feelings yeah man that that feeling of just suspense of like everyone's acting,0.04139172
normal but they're a little off and I know that there's something underneath that's going,0.09047628
down but I can't figure out what yet the movie is not coming yet but,0.018569266
I know everything ain't right or when someone goes from one move to another move,0.019549748
really quickly for whatever reason like this gave me some flashbacks of watching 10 Cloverfield,0.048068833
Lane and just how the suspense was with this movie the whole time I watch,0.0434631
this movie I'm just like this like usually when you're watching a movie and you,0.046947997
like having fun like a Lego Batman or a comedy or something that you can,0.08412577
like sit back you lean back get Sharleen back gets popcorn you just like rule,0.06383701
is I'm having a great time movie time just relaxing you know if you don't,0.031826377
have anybody in those in the seat in front of you you might even get,0.06044191
a little like home body and I ain't got no manners to speed up you,0.049235564
know how it is but what this movie man I was like this the whole,0.06444033
time like and air any sound like not even like jump jump scare type sound,0.15473701
like just you know up walk like you hear like a twig getting cut from,0.18011975
someone's foot touching the ground I'm like what that was that wasn't what's going on,0.094594434
that's kind of how I felt watching this things about this is so suspenseful and,0.03901036
it's just one of those movies where you're just like you don't know what's going,0.091551885
to happen or how people are going to act in this and and it's just,0.046761744
the tension is just so deep and I felt that the entire time watching this,0.037884206
thing so that's one thing you're reminding me live how I felt when I was,0.03262726
watching 10 Cloverfield Lane like man John Goodman is helping me a little winters it,0.045233153
out but at the same time King y'all there I got a got to live,0.09456916
off this like this family they seem cool then you know the making food and,0.058268756
everything seemed right was hell me right I know something right and then when you,0.23391056
start meeting the people that's helping them network at the place and you know and,0.025526423
of course like that's what a report comes in cuz they're all black you just,0.49604666
like something about them either you know this dude going in here and either like,0.03647468
a really black people working here I think I could be cool with it but,0.31336206
then you meet them you Amy they were everyone weird why oh man isn't it,0.07988057
um so I really like that bad I really really appreciated that that style of,0.03922322
suspense with this movie you just don't know what's going on but you know something,0.10659834
they are right and then what adds the extra element to that is the stuff,0.016894335
about race now I'm guessing that this may be the type of movie that is,0.0595499
going to work for different people in different ways depending on what your background is,0.018137563
so I can only explain it for myself but as a black man particularly one,0.4596664
who has been in situations at times where I've been surrounded by all white people,0.33473533
on their element in this movie that I kind of relate it to a couple,0.018208737
of times I was like I know this is fictional and I know this is,0.02024686
a suspense and I know that there is something extra to this movie that has,0.027607117
nothing to do with with real life because it's a fantasy you know situation but,0.0409507
the thing that's happening here I can relate that to actual things that happened to,0.007613027
me I realized there's a without giving away too much there's a party scene that,0.039410137
happens in this movie and it's very much related to the movie but I have,0.025946153
been to a bit I have been to parties and I have been in conversations,0.036785986
particularly in LA that I was like I know that situation I've been there I,0.040661346
can literally like take myself out of my seat take myself in the movie theater,0.09379422
and go I have been in that situation are you are you focusing on some,0.03766802
pleasures my cameras aren't focusing on on the screen as opposed to on me not,0.031648107
this black faces black face cameras make a decision anyway so yeah Matt you you,0.54355747
you can't help but notice at least for me I couldn't I hope but add,0.024627093
that extra tension to the movie so you've already got the suspenseful stuff going on,0.055005368
and then you add the tension of race on top of that and it's not,0.13957681
even so much blatant stuff it's just just situation it's just the situation and that's,0.027855895
why I was saying I think it's going to work different for different people because,0.056867216
it was a situation that I could relate to based on my life experience and,0.025823094
based on experiences of others I know who've been in some situations it's like I,0.032408413
I could just feel an extra level of attention that I don't know other people,0.03333169
will feel but I felt it I felt about the entire movie man and it,0.084175
was it was intense man the other reason why I would compare this movie to,0.061651215
10 Cloverfield Lane is because like that movie there's a lot of times you're going,0.031493787
to want to pay close attention to just everything in the movie you want to,0.023545505
pay attention to things people say things people do certain lines of dialogue certain objects,0.04830763
certain things you just want to keep tabs because there's going to be things you,0.038803488
know what was that all about and then when that all the pieces start getting,0.034705292
put in the place you be like oh now I see why this person said,0.064148314
this or this person did that it's like it will all sort of come together,0.08300095
gets all scooby-doo mystery on you like God says Velma comes out and says I,0.09413347
mean the reason why this thing happened is because of this and now you understand,0.039962903
jinkies you know I get it get to that moment um so that that's really,0.090309985
cool too because I think it's going to be one of those types of films,0.07857083
where if you watch it the first time I only watched it once but I,0.04172697
feel like if I were watching a second time there were things that probably just,0.018521374
kind of look like oh that's the thing but I'm now watching and go oh,0.02962861
okay I see what you did there Jordan Peele you crappy dude so uh so,0.3616675
that that's that's really neat um you know are there any issues with the movie,0.015536695
you know it it after a while you start to start put the pieces together,0.15481219
yourself it starts to get a little predictable it isn't Blum House production so some,0.036590423
of the element are Blum house II but at the same time I know that,0.012188825
Blum house kind of had this period of just trying to make every movie cheap,0.05571445
and like paranormal activity or whatever but you can tell that you know even though,0.034725912
this is a bottle film it only takes place in a couple locations you can,0.07895264
tell that there was definitely some work into how it shot into the performances the,0.13340192
performances are great everyone plays it on this subtle level to where you again you're,0.028870966
like questioning like wait are you saying this because that's just how you are as,0.04948634
a person or are you saying this because there's something going on that I'm not,0.02984679
noticing here so like they're really good at that the music is always this kind,0.08038878
of like violin sounding or just kind of creepy sounding that makes things more intense,0.045995455
it shot beautifully it's performed great a lot of people play it very subtle there,0.12935427
are a couple of characters that are a little bit more so not so subtle,0.05725502
uh but that's okay because they either makes them really creepy or really hilarious so,0.0539577
either way you're fine there's an actor in here in a little realm he's a,0.028745912
comedian and he's great he basically without again without saying too much but but if,0.030958312
you are a person that constantly goes to horror movie then you're one of the,0.07686729
people who's like why are you doing this why you doing that don't go in,0.051010273
there don't do that that's basically his character in this movie ah you can kind,0.05024398
of relate to his character in that same kind of way so so yeah man,0.012938487
oh man it I just I really really like this movie I just very much,0.056668326
enjoyed it and I think it's very interesting to see a horror slash suspense film,0.10795199
use the subject of race as a way to add more horror add more suspense,0.16815376
to something that is fictionalized but yet you can still connect it to things in,0.013887039
life which that's how it is with pretty much any drama you look at like,0.06422348
sci-fi or even comedies or action even though it's a fictionalized fantasy version of what's,0.050412938
going on the screen you can always kind of relate it related to real world,0.0147584295
things and that's what happens with this I mean I don't think it's a preachy,0.03513899
movie I think it's just a movie that uses a subject of race who is,0.072197035
advantage to tell a story so if anyone's going is going was it is it,0.032917276
Reese's I don't know no you know what grow a pair I'm sorry it's all,0.039352264
right boohoo a movie about suspension car use the subject of race to help get,0.042622972
mrs. Benson car oh man went away you know like deal with it okay because,0.054876987
that's what the movie is and that's what made it intriguing to me when I,0.019620256
first saw that trailer for I was like I got to see that you know,0.035711713
I didn't do a reaction video because I wasn't really doing reactions of trailers at,0.027565876
the time but mark my words when it came out at this time period I,0.039166015
would have done but anyway uh yeah man I knew for a fact that I,0.05718717
want to see what was going on here and now thing I really think it's,0.046181705
really good and particularly for it coming from Jordan Peele who is a person that,0.035053182
you know is known for comedy known for key and Peele and bad TV and,0.042720754
sketch comedy and things like that to see him on the other side being a,0.07443471
writer being a director I mean obviously he had a lot of great work doing,0.05254352
this in comedy like cameo you know I was thinking they were writing the sketches,0.10554003
everything but to see him take that talent into another genre was really cool and,0.04782737
I thought was very effective I mean you know I I just I really was,0.017147103
intrigued by this movie and that's really all I want to say about it I'm,0.055081863
not going in any more detail more than that all I'm saying is if you,0.04581519
like horror films if you like suspense film and you are whipping a be about,0.1722094
race being mentioned in the movie then get out for you for the schedule Barry,0.09486982
okay two kids see Batman and speak on over to the other theater and seek,0.07215912
it out uh yeah man I just I like this movie I really really enjoyed,0.10431875
it like I saw this screening but I actually want to go see it again,0.03095299
I'm going to Newark on this weekend so I don't if I get to see,0.045327608

get out I want to see the movie again just because I'd be intrigued to,0.029993795
see if I catch anything the second time around I'm watching it again so there,0.022393407
