hello I haven't really done this in a while and I thought I wanted I,0.03911413
would want to kind of start easy into this whole thing so I recently watched,0.08317323
this movie called eighth grade which I'm sure everyone has heard of something green many,0.037980657
people have heard of it although it may not be like a popular movie per,0.016688127
se but I saw it recently in quite late to the party and I thought,0.018950418
it was very fascinating because of how well fails were unfamiliar eighth grade is about,0.04083895
a girl who is in eighth grade and in the 2010s and it really encapsulate,0.06434787
so the era of it and it's very fascinating because if well getting into it,0.037495073
more later but there's this idea in which technology is just so quickly and rapidly,0.023539519
developing and changing every few years that again watching this movie and maybe two years,0.040322103
from now maybe two years from my you watch this movie again it will appeal,0.051138654
to something be quite adequate because perhaps if the specific reference is a certain things,0.014020741
in social media specific trends the fact that this film opens and ends with a,0.023691181
YouTube recording a recording of a YouTube video and that YouTube is it really is,0.022976108
a big part of the lives of many younger people and even just more more,0.04564623
people in general like you know this idea that this is a new platform that,0.03169068
has really superseded the media landscape those are what one would choose is doing an,0.024855252
any given point is to kind of you know go on their phone or whatever,0.03369155
and watch some videos online and that really is a big part of how this,0.044852003
generation this new crop of human beings coming into this world has to deal with,0.2918666
unfortunately or fortunately you know it there many things that go in and out of,0.07277176
that but there's what what struck me most about it I mean you know this,0.053657703
movie's fine it's funny and sweet and all that but what struck me most about,0.056726195
the movie maybe really think because there's a scene in the movie where the young,0.05690779
and I forgot her name but the actors Elsie Fisher she was about to hang,0.12529266
out with this new friend she made it was an older high school student and,0.037218355
they go to this mall of sores and they are having some kind of you,0.1752892
know they they they have dinner or something and this older boy makes a suggestion,0.06024502
it makes no suggestion but he makes a he kind of asks questions of this,0.029079834
young a the grader girl in which he seems to delineate that there seems to,0.24037775
be a generation a generational difference between a pair of friends and the young girl,0.043439154
and it's a four-year age difference but for some reason it feels generational because a,0.029929938
lot of the things that they felt they grew up on and whether it is,0.012678401
ideals or whatever a lot of the things they grew up on and she did,0.042592373
not grow up on and things that she grew up on we're not not exist,0.098721236
of and they were kind of coming of age and the example of use is,0.013634269
like when did you get your first we need use snapchat and she says fifth,0.08008811
grade and for them that they so if they think well that's kind of crazy,0.18800151
that you were in fifth grade when the snapchat came out because it definitely would,0.08647188
have change how you perceive the world or she did say something about how you,0.028405337
know probably were sending dick pics in fifth grade with each other you know because,0.5482312
I guess snapchat is used in a very sexual manner or some teenagers so it,0.31443462
seems that that the fact that it was a popular must have influenced how she,0.023693841
and others people her age develop and think about the world in a way that,0.08010607
even distinguishes them generationally even though it's just four years when you think about like,0.025364783
stuff like the baby boomers and gen-x and you know these how people are mentally,0.19796199
distinguished generations were in these like 20 30 year block periods of time when you,0.049072593
would have been born and now on a practical level on a relational level it,0.10166734
seems that there are generational differences between someone who is saying my age and someone,0.09115277
who is four years younger than me and four years younger than them because of,0.024225323
how big how it really it seems to that a lot of how we interact,0.038615905
with the world does rapidly is rapidly changing and in developing and I think it's,0.042722084
it's interesting because I'm not sure how do how it would play for someone who's,0.033027034
older right or someone who's older than me for example who didn't have to do,0.050951738
didn't really have to kind of go through the specifics of the specificities of the,0.015426274
social media a revolution of sorts it does feel for me for example that when,0.029262759
I imagine my growing up and the degree to which I had social media I,0.017507633
do think that one social media became such a popular thing it did influence our,0.018045766
relied in such a big way that it must it does feel like there must,0.038993064
be some kind of disconnect but it's hard to tell how that will kind of,0.028208442
manifest in the future whether or not that not that it actually you know it,0.021781439
changes anything particular the fact that according up within the internet for example I think,0.028966088
probably you know me gives me a different experience of obviously because me different experience,0.03035233
but I grew up with a very strong inclination towards trying to read things online,0.019769924
and Masri di love thing and Wikipedia and being able to you know read about,0.044161543
movies or see movies or all these things I would have been impossible before you,0.049364608
know and the thing with social media with specifically with younger people is that it,0.029852778
agree as it's kind of an obvious thing I don't even feel like it's very,0.03980592
interesting for me to talk about it but again it's this idea where you kind,0.06461261
of have to create this online identity of source so that seems to be just,0.020523576
as important perhaps as your social real life I don't say real life but like,0.051843747
your physical identity and it's you have to kind of manipulate how you are perceived,0.1870829
in those different kind of Stratton's of you know it's it's a whole thing that,0.023672557
it's a whole issue that some people feel like they need to deal with and,0.022349505
it's a very common right now obviously but it does definitely does seem like something,0.024298493
that would be stressful if one had to kind of go into that from a,0.038295288
very young age because again when I think about my growing up when I was,0.030450111
around an eighth grade or whatever the degree to which I had social media was,0.023641292
um we had messaging apps which is I was on Yahoo Messenger and that was,0.041808788
the extent of it I mean there was no real sense of identity to that,0.029965859
degree were except for the fact that you would have the ability to be true,0.043562878
as a profile picture and maybe write a little bit like a status message I,0.03957643
think which is interesting because it doesn't really rhyme come up in the future social,0.023514908
media platforms but where you have like a persistent set of words or things that,0.034860946
you know that would always be seen whenever one that he tries to contact you,0.013005005
like a Fraser some people put links and music or whatever it was but that,0.021035768
was only that was the extent of it we didn't have to think about the,0.016365513
say the mystification of the daily life through snapchat stories or Instagram stories or the,0.017302092
idea that one has to constantly a massive following or at least not the study,0.022384094
that one has to a massive following but that one's so-called following has some kind,0.033680245
of pertinence to their social status and their even in the school setting because I,0.05526612
definitely have seen this manifest in some places I know I've I've involuntary dad for,0.031550992
example in different schools or even just in my own school and saying oh when,0.020837544
I was about to leave high school it was just a very big thing it,0.053659033
is a very big thing that is being a part of the lives of those,0.033176698
who are growing up and I'm very curious to see how it kind of well,0.015806094
if it even does influence how when things about the world and process things and,0.044532716
the amount of maybe perhaps personal stress and how we how the creation of the,0.023680538
the separate identity the online identity how that kind of evolved in manifestos you went,0.056888502
as one gets older as well and comes out to say the face of adolescence,0.07819832
which you know is a long period but again it's it's so eighth grade I,0.02340116
mean I don't guess I don't read it didn't even talk about the movie that,0.01972336
much I liked it you know it's fine but I was very fascinated about that,0.020275462
idea right of the idea of the the shortening of the supposedly but you can,0.028938815
argue about what a generational gap even means and maybe you can say well it,0.038502824
doesn't even matter it's not a real generational gap but the fact that in practice,0.04319769
is felt is something worth probably considering and I'm wondering how as I kind of,0.016210526
progresses into the future so you know that's what I thought about some of the,0.027787382
things I went on in that movie I've I know there are many things I,0.026705127
can talk about over the next few however long I'm going to be doing these,0.034228355
but yeah I was gone because I was a backpacking in Japan for a few,0.08329297
for two and a half months I was backpacking it made it difficult to kind,0.022228442
of and I didn't really want to make videos I just wanted to kind of,0.025484515
experience things in the moment and those in that kind of period and it was,0.026813554
a lot of things can go on I can talk about some of those stuff,0.019457286
next time but yeah this is what I think honey watch the movie and especially,0.032405086
I think is very useful to watch the movie if you are someone who doesn't,0.03321794
understand doesn't understand the younger generation because the movie does kind of get a lot,0.023697168
of or it seems to you know accurately depict a lot of the issues that,0.017210297
seems to be persistent in say people who are my age people who are a,0.052442413
few years younger than me it is quite accurate I think so you know that's,0.02886631
interesting to look at if you are not very young if you don't quite understand,0.08256459
what it's like or you want to kind of know a little peek into the,0.038156264
the gen Z life then you can check out the movie I think you'll be,0.077698104
