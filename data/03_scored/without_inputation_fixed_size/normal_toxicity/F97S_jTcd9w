hi I'm a mandrill and today I will be reviewing director Guillermo del Toro's 2017,0.079674944
movie the shape of water it's basically the story of a mute woman who works,0.2607242
in janitorial services and at her job she encounters a nonhuman entity will just say,0.11402736
that and a relationship build between the two some would call it a modern-day beauty,0.07977997
and the beast' del toro style or you could also say cutie and The Creature,0.1814696
from the Black Lagoon because that's more accurate I heard about the movie I was,0.18153615
not intrigued I wasn't interested it kind of looks like Pan's Labyrinth and that rid,0.10005196
didn't really get me excited this director definitely has a style of his own and,0.08817093
it's not a style that's really me but after watching the Oscars and seeing mr.,0.09984061
del Toro clean up I thought okay fine maybe I should give this movie a,0.10628106
chance maybe it's actually good well once again this is not for me just gonna,0.123888664
say overall it's very Pan's Labyrinth II in the visuals and the story is also,0.03590521
kind of Hellboy meets Beauty and the Beast meets well as I said The Swamp,0.15258488
Thing Creature from the Black Lagoon meets Aquaman to a certain extent I don't know,0.096439146
I had a really a hard time buying into the premise and going with it,0.05596255
just so much was like uncomfortable I liked the arrow we're in we're in I,0.08613541
don't know if it's the 50s the 40s I like the music they used from,0.11533696
earlier times and they have a lot of vintage TV movie clips in the movie,0.06894583
and when I saw that you know black and white clips I knew okay well,0.17338997
there you go that's why it went in Oscar because there's a trend with the,0.057755712
Oscars that I've noticed every movie that has a love for the cinema or an,0.069416635
ode to cinema and film and it portrays some kind of old movie in it,0.052385192
or embodies an old style those movies usually win Oscars okay yeah it made a,0.12156843
nod to the past it acknowledged its history but does that mean it deserves an,0.06536353
Oscar just because it feels timeless the performances are good I wasn't blown away by,0.0559559
anyone in particular Michael Shannon was I mean he plays Michael Shannon at this point,0.06545203
I don't know if he's typecast or he gravitates towards roles that put him in,0.23405558
this position where he is just a villain or very intense creepy scary Sally Hawkins,0.31089434
as a mute had to do a lot of facial expressions and body acting she,0.35076737
did a good job she really did they tried to set up this relationship between,0.07105189
her and I guess her neighbor or caretaker played by Richard Jenkins but I don't,0.060452297
know I didn't see it I felt like this movie wants us to believe oh,0.052112494
these two go way back and they have a relationship but I really did not,0.09414469
get that even Octavia Spencer's character felt very theatrical with the fast-talking and the always,0.05150689
blabbering because you know oh you have the nude girl of course she's gonna be,0.69542736
friends with the girl who can't stop talking because she just needs somebody to listen,0.43214518
to her it feels like a trope it feels like something a little bit obvious,0.24431774
I don't know it felt theatrical but I think that's what Guillermo goes for he,0.06967364
goes for something kind of big and showy he's telling a fairy tale and you're,0.14423509
often reminded that this is very much fantastical and not grounded in any reality but,0.049916163
I still feel like he aims for reality that's why I'm mentioning it but maybe,0.061738867
I'm completely wrong maybe he just wants us to be in fantasy world and forget,0.19215152
about reality forget about how unnatural people are how people talk how people interact with,0.15201817
one another he just inspires himself in real life but then Chuck's it all out,0.17372933
the window my gosh this movie gave me huge Amelie Pula Amelie Amelie vibes that's,0.21855024
one of my favorite movies I haven't seen it a long time as a teenager,0.06780519
I watched it over and over and over again so it's just a part of,0.06511773
me the way Jumanji is watching this movie I saw ok color theme is very,0.100156315
Emily music with the accordion and everything very Emily quirky love story very Emily Richard,0.073681995
Jenkins character painting near a window it's a French movie for those who don't know,0.113249935
about a quirky different unique wrenches Zooey Deschanel kind of girl it's just about her,0.26534644
and her world and how she views the world and it's interesting talk about the,0.091759786
best soundtrack ever in cinema shout out to yanti erson amazing so one of the,0.075343214
elements that is really showy and extra is the village he has all the things,0.05292239
that a villain has he's racist a supremacist a religious fanatic he's an idiot he's,0.94908285
gross like wash your hands ill and what he develops a mute fetish after he,0.8355208
meets Eliza like he's power-hungry and insecure and oh just too much too much for,0.19010043
me and we see this kind of rotten personality is portrayed and symbolism it's all,0.46850482
I'm gonna say I don't want to spoil it no pun intended I say this,0.09647728
movie is pg-13 I don't know what its labels got some mature scenes in there,0.065691106
- it's got some violence more than I thought it would have it's kind of,0.20580891
visually striking so yeah I don't think it's for children no no and the female,0.29974136
character at times kind of feels written by a man but I don't know I,0.15161568
don't know all women so I can't speak but every morning in the tub really,0.44666728
hey apparently this woman is exceptional and unusual and it's a fantasy character when did,0.2872063
she learn to tap dance I had questions why eggs exclusively it's not kind of,0.16397293
bad for your diet and then you have the fish dude you know no sorry,0.2728118
I know no I don't love fish I eat fish now he's not really a,0.06260148
fish fine he's not that far removed but he's not they mentioned that he might,0.13585554
be some kind of South American godlike creature Oh God no he seemed to be,0.2537078
very much mortal and always on the brink of death I would say maybe he's,0.33998677
an x-men character you know he's a mutant he is a very more realistic portrayal,0.27566925
of what you would expect Aquaman to be but hot no girl no no I'll,0.5614893
tell you what she was into the Mavs is what she was into I mean,0.20884183
shape of water hawk you know what I'm saying I don't know it was really,0.06565524
hard for me to buy into their evolving relationship insecurities much she makes a speech,0.11504487
at some point about feeling like an outsider feeling alone and deficient as a human,0.32381967
being but when he looks at her or when she's with him she feels completely,0.07252242
just sounds like you've got major insecurity issues and what you are so dissatisfied with,0.31089434
who are that a human man could never be into you you have to go,0.40310484
and find your mate in the fish world this is not the beginning of a,0.10321479
healthy relationship I had compassion for him as a living being a creature I was,0.31089434
like yes it's unfair that he is in this tank that he was stolen that,0.18968624
he was brought to this place to be researched and poked and prodded and mistreated,0.15282765
yes I can have compassion for him on that level but as a love interest,0.07443941
as a human being I have my limits and I found them through this movie,0.0959017
and it felt at time like they were trying to equate or some kind of,0.067559086
metaphor between racism and fish ISM I don't know I'm not saying that that's what,0.24110778
they were going for but it felt like they were leaning on oh just because,0.066158354
it doesn't look like you you hate him they brought up racism in the movie,0.46057436
they brought up homophobia in the movie they brought up just hating of people that,0.6324053
aren't conventional to society in ways that I thought were kind of obvious and just,0.09308081
too direct either I have seen way too many movies about injustice and discrimination and,0.1296235
I'm just fed up with it or it just kind of felt like a plot,0.12544328
device and emotional manipulation almost to a certain extent ah now you're supposed to hate,0.25982636
this character and have sympathy for this character and that's how you're gonna love the,0.072289065
team of misfits that we're putting together for you the end end is somewhat predictable,0.40329498
not super predictable but when they show Eliza has a certain characteristic in her childhood,0.1944779
you can kind of expect the movie to go in a certain direction especially at,0.090692766
the end and that's what we get Oh cute creative who know this movie just,0.08716334
felt like a spoof of lala land the romantic scenes the moments where we leave,0.14866751
this reality now we're in a dance sequence tab dancing etc I don't want to,0.062728316
say too much but there's a whole Russian storyline to this movie that I felt,0.16268873
was unnecessary I didn't see how it added anything it was violent for violence sake,0.098803364
the character involved in that storyline could have been integrated in another way and would,0.031908114
have served his purpose just as well my advice would be if they're gonna do,0.062999085
a sequel Marvel should snatch this movie up talk to your man Toro and turn,0.44794405
this into the blueish green or teal Panther and we can have Wakanda in South,0.07731222
America call it El Dorado I mean that's kind of what makandal was referred to,0.15540746
as and in the end the creature could just be a guy in a suit,0.24889097
and we see him you know exit the waters and is if it off and,0.07940759
it's just William Levy under all of that mmm that would kill audiences you're welcome,0.28097212
Marvel I will accept some royalty fees thank you I think I said what I,0.14861001
had to say about shape of water it's not for me if you like del,0.14469744
Toro movies if you like Beauty and the Beast the concept if you're not averse,0.16214235
to bestiality if you're into a mini pool on the movie in la-la land even,0.34334576
to a certain extent if you even like Finding Nemo watch this movie cinema for,0.10168027
the graphics not so necessary at home sure more of a home movie I would,0.082238466
say but why he won all those Oscars I'm sorry it's beyond me as I,0.08389415
said I think it's just because he referenced old movies and they're just like oh,0.1469536
look my grandfather was in this movie we should give him the Oscar just kidding,0.035058666
