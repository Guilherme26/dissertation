I was excited for this movie I think most people who love movies are because it's directed by Christopher Nolan and so obviously you're instantly thinking to yourself okay at the very least this is going to be a magnificent spectacle,0.1807598
and Dunkirk utilizes real boats real planes real locations humongous amounts of extras to immerse you in this moment to make you feel so completely taken over by it,0.07388119
and it works this movie is thrilling,0.07483032
imagine,0.04992532
Michael Bay's,0.056085553
Pearl Harbor say what you want about that movie it's not good,0.1076353
but cut out the first like 90 minutes and the film just starts with the attack on Pearl Harbor and the rest of the movie is the attack,0.112360865
and that's the whole film from the opening shot of Dunkirk,0.11080888
you are in it we're introduced to a few characters very quickly,0.07000661
and then you are instantaneously in this battle and it never lets up,0.18002766

Oh boohoo,0.04724052
there's never a moment like that,0.07556563
you don't get those moments that you're so used to seeing in war films and sometimes that can be a hindrance on the film as well because my one major issue with this movie which doesn't detract from it too much is that I didn't feel a specific connection with any one character like I wanted to root for them or I connected with them emotionally in fact I suppose who you might view as the audience character the one young person that you're introduced to,0.07944956
in the opening scene barely speaks a word for the first half of the movie this movie is about the event,0.05751492
it's about this evacuation of all of these men it's about being in the middle of a horrific situation,0.34278047

there's bombs all over the place right now,0.34044033
and I was just hoping we could have a nice conversation,0.058025055
this movie is in the moment and the way Noland Helms all of these battle sequences,0.096604764
it's what film was invented for everything on the screen looks completely authentic,0.06737672
there's never a moment that feels wasted,0.12803131
there's not a scene that feels misplaced and although it's very simplistic in its characterization its storytelling isn't and I don't want to get into,0.15492694
why because I feel that that would be spoiler territory,0.113342196
but there's a moment in this film where I saw a character in the nighttime and I went wait a second,0.04661184
I like the film is about an hour and 46 minutes which is very short for Noland,0.068409175
and when I found that out I was surprised by it but since the film begins in the battle and ends in the battle and it's just a battle,0.047185984
it's one,0.06593724
gigantic sequence told in a very interesting way,0.06433955
and the runtime I think is perfect because if it had gone on any longer,0.18159787
I think would have outstayed its welcome if it was any shorter,0.112521596
there wouldn't have been enough impact the impact of this movie emotionally doesn't come from you going,0.11473415
I hope that that person makes it out of this situation so he can get home to his family,0.1303125
it comes from seeing this spectacle,0.11582675
some might not like that it is about the spectacle,0.103436716
the aerial dogfights sequences with Tom Hardy whose eyeballs act very well in this film that poor guy is always gonna wear a mask,0.3415044
I think and everything he's gonna have something over his face,0.16763258
those dogfights are so riveting and so white-knuckled because they look authentic the planes don't blow up in theatrical ways,0.38691232
the gunfire does not look like movie gunfire everything about it just feels,0.14589323
so scarily real that despite the fact that the characters aren't really given much set up,0.044887085
and this movie is 100% about this moment,0.07695822
I was riveted from seeing one because I felt like I was there Hans Zimmer's score once again something,0.06918042
he does with Nolan movies it's not so much melodical as it is almost sound design,0.1417177
and I am still playing these noises in my head and I will be purchasing the soundtrack,0.15426202
and I can't wait to hear it again,0.08105862
if you go into Dunkirk expecting a one two three four five straightforward narrative with characters with emotional arcs and big moments where they explode with incredible dialogue you're not going to get that this movie as I said is very simplistic,0.14621715
but it's also highly realistic people die in war and sometimes people die alone terrified having no idea what's going on and does that person get an amazing arc or is someone there to tell them everything's going to be okay not always and this film doesn't shy away from showing that yes,0.20230861
there's not too much blood it's pg-13,0.16160366
there are no limbs flying around,0.11907877
there's no intense gruesome imagery but it's the psychological impact on all of the characters involved with this movie that make it so frightening because you're witnessing characters who are so horrified by what they're seeing or by what they feel could happen to them,0.15438138
they are all desperately clawing to get out and the ones who are trying to go in to help you also feel for them,0.07117584
the whole film captures this event so beautifully that it's tough to really pinpoint any magnificently huge flaws beyond the fact that the characters are lacking I'm gonna give Dunkirk an a excellent war films like Saving Private Ryan are about characters in a horrible situation,0.09068287
they're about seeing these people react to war Dunkirk is just about war,0.1586881
