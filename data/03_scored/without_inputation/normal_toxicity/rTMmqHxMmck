a quiet place is directed by John Krasinski and stars him and his real-life wife Emily Blunt as a married couple living on their farm trying to keep their family safe in a world that has now been overtaken by alien creature things,0.24215138
and safety is not guaranteed because that these creatures are all though blind they are incredibly fast and violent and our hypersensitive to noise basically if you make even the slightest amount of noise outside of the general nature,0.17769186
eco noises that exist day to day these creatures are going to hear you they're gonna find you,0.31089434
and they're going to tear you apart [Applause] you guys this entire movie I had my popcorn held up to my face like this,0.47939104
and that's for two reasons one for some reason whenever I watch horror movies thrillers anything where there's tension and anxiety,0.15668085
I find it a lot easier to watch if half of my face is obscured,0.21897234
I don't know why I've always kind of had this thing really and horror movies I'll often watch through fingers like this,0.18395123
but the second reason my popcorn stayed firmly in front of my face was because you cannot eat popcorn in this movie it's too noisy,0.29201835
so the theater that I watched this movie in was quite small,0.1098831
it was about 30 seats maybe and about half of the people that are watching this movie had popcorn for the first 20 minutes of the movie it's practically quiet,0.089165315
so everyone was kind of sitting there had their popcorn out Carlita too noisy would wait until there was maybe like some dialogue or some music,0.23486127
and then it was like either the popcorn drink all the drinks and it would go quiet again and then you put your popcorn down and I think the reason that this is a testament to how well sound or lack of sound is utilizing this film is that if you're an audience member and you feel panic about making noise because the characters on the screen feel panicked about making noise then that just shows how transported you are into this film,0.1140127
so the film centers around this family about just under a year and a half after these creatures have invaded I guess and they are still living on their family farm,0.0638099
they communicate,0.08199316
mostly via sign language and they've established these safeguards all these signals for emergencies,0.124323264
so they've kind of established some sort of day-to-day way of dealing with these creatures,0.14955796
also the mother Evelyn is pretty heavily,0.08916551
pregnant which we'll talk about a little bit later as well,0.18827128
so one of the best parts about this movie is seeing what steps the parents have taken to create a kind of normal life for their children,0.120579325
and what is obviously a very abnormal situation the children or games,0.24037346
but instead of the little plastic pieces they now play with pieces of fabric or pom-pom type things,0.119574405
they have homework they have family dinners around the dinner table they have created this kind of normal world for their children,0.108048625
and it's the little attention to detail in these scenes that really brings to life this family and their struggle in this universe I really love the casting in this film John Emily have amazing chemistry,0.06373431
what you'd expect because they are married in real life,0.14473328
but the children in this film are phenomenal in particular the deaf daughter and the movie Regan is played by an actress called Millicent Simmons who is deaf in real life,0.096894115
and she was absolutely outstanding in this I've watched interviews with John Krasinski where he said that he insisted that a deaf actress was cast to play the role of Regan one because he didn't want somebody pretending to be deaf,0.1910673
but two because he really wanted to get a true sense of what it would be like to be deaf in this world that he had creatives,0.26892054
and I think that really paid off because it does feel very genuine,0.08819991
and the movie another thing that's really interesting which comes from this deaf character is the difference between quiet and the film end true silence whenever Reagan's on the screen always see the movie from her point of view they've removed all sound from the screen so it's completely silent and to me this added an extra layer of tension because for somebody who was deaf living in a world where noise is so important it would be so much harder,0.099104054
not knowing ie whether you've created noise,0.18786466
so if you accidentally stand on something or not something over you wouldn't even hear that or likewise if you were near something that was creating noise and you wouldn't be able to hear it,0.12075003
and there's a scene in the movie that really captures that where there is one of the creatures behind her heavily breathing but she obviously hasn't noticed it because she can't hear that so let's talk about emily Blunt's character evelyn being pregnant for a moment i had no problem with the fact that she was pregnant of anything actually it does provide one of the most tense scenes in the entire movie my gripe with it,0.11523967
was the fact that the film is set for the most part on day or around day 460 something I think which is about a year and a half and to these creatures invading and Evelyn's maybe seven months pregnant which means that she got pregnant after the creatures invaded,0.15035379
we see so much of them putting in these safeguards for their children and really trying to protect themselves in the future of their kids,0.17167813
it didn't feel like a decision that the characters would have made to me,0.05874273
I don't think they would have consciously made the decision to have a child maybe it wasn't a conscious decision,0.15990439
but it feels like it would would have been some ways of him to avoid that happening,0.10189424
I would have preferred that rather than it being de 460 whatever it was say de 180 which means that Evelyn could have been pregnant prior to this happening and not known about it or something like that rather than it being a decision that potentially they made consciously not a flaw with the film by any means just a personal preference for me,0.10410749
it would have made more sense to have,0.06842988
it that way there are a couple of decisions that I didn't like as well in this movie namely,0.10084862
something that happens with John Krasinski's character Lee towards the end of the film and also a revelation that happens towards the end of the film again not flaws in my opinion just things that I didn't quite like as much,0.06088603
but overall this film I think was absolutely fantastic,0.10539631
it was scary it was tense,0.13306649
every single,0.07971522
second,0.053916644
I cared about this these characters in this family absolutely want to watch in the movie theatre because I think the the way that sounds utilized is heightened when you're in that movie theater situation,0.08000896
but differently one to see I really enjoyed it quiet place,0.11760236
I'm really excited to see what John Krasinski does next as a director because I think he has done a fantastic job with this,0.1412096
one I'm giving a quiet place 8.5 out of 10,0.11241214
