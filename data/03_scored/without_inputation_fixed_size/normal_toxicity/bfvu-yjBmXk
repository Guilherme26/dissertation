The Farewell written and directed by Lulu Wang takes place primarily in China where a,0.07586098
family is visiting the matriarch of the family 9i the family is going to visit,0.19249769
9i because she's been recently diagnosed with terminal lung cancer but the family agrees that,0.11663254
it's best not to tell her that 9i doesn't know she's sick she thinks that,0.43439743
her family is visiting her because of a family wedding which she's taken the liberty,0.14705117
of planning as each family member tries to enjoy the remaining time with 9i they,0.061240546
also hope to spare her from the truth all right so I've been really looking,0.08726549
forward to seeing the farewell for a while now I've seen the film be praised,0.035626736
pretty much everywhere and I've been like constantly checking my local theater to see if,0.101630405
they're actually playing it at some point since I live in a smaller area sometimes,0.07445371
8:24 films don't come to my area right away it's actually usually what happens and,0.11256769
that happened with the farewell as well I mean it took quite a while to,0.052714624
actually get here regardless I went in with high expectations and I have to say,0.06120654
that I believe those expectations were met for the most part I think that the,0.04971829
farewell is definitely a must-see primarily because it touches on a lot of important topics,0.081797965
such as tradition family personal identity and a lot of other things along those lines,0.05747467
but you could also argue that it's just a must-see because it's just a well,0.07573007
made film with the compelling story either way you slice it the farewell is an,0.06918089
experience that's worth your time and money because it's emotionally impactful the film was primarily,0.07742622
seen through the perspective of awkwafina's character Billy Billy is in an interesting position because,0.05550558
she's lived most of her life in America so her beliefs and customs more so,0.22219191
aligned with American culture more so than they do with Chinese culture she can't quite,0.23978171
wrap her head around why the family believes they need to lie to 9i about,0.47618705
you know her terminal lung cancer condition in America most families would never think of,0.1728252
doing something like this and there's even a point in the film where the characters,0.049774252
discuss how you know in America they wouldn't do something like this and how it,0.1334797
would actually be considered illegal in America at least in the film the characters believe,0.092698574
that Chinese culture is to you know spare their loved one from the truth so,0.118516974
they don't fear their inevitable death at the hands of you know their terminal condition,0.40308937
it's very almost heartbreaking to watch the characters hold true to this cultural tradition while,0.034331042
they have to internalize and live with the fact that they're not only lying to,0.18933086
their beloved family member but that their time with is very short as the movie,0.15067545
progresses you see the characters struggling more and more with the lying and coming to,0.2686612
terms with the fact that they're almost about to lose a loved one one that,0.07063032
they hold very dear to their heart and there's an unsettling feeling you get because,0.052307047
you and the characters all know an important piece of information that one of the,0.059599347
other important characters doesn't and that results in each scene feeling a bit tense and,0.058354747
with significant weight to it The Farewell also discusses culture and tradition insightfully Billy is,0.064662546
Americanized in many ways and she is often challenging the idea that 9'i needs to,0.048494816
be spared from the truth and I like to have the film focuses on how,0.05489356
culture can dictate what our ethics are and our overall decision-making what is deemed normal,0.11894657
varies from culture to culture and some traditions may even appear cruel to those on,0.0986903
the outside looking in one of the best parts of the film is the way,0.034004673
the characters have to you know grapple with upholding tradition and what they feel is,0.057615265
inherently right this is a constant struggle for them and it really is kind of,0.08246194
tough to watch but in an entertaining kind of way through and through the farewell,0.10390731
is awesomely performed I mean every character has their moments but as I mentioned Billy,0.07662025
is the perspective through which the viewer understands the story I think aquafina deserves to,0.058761086
be an Oscar conversation I think that ultimately she will become February she does a,0.07473769
really great job of showing the toll that this whole dilemma is taking on her,0.08040717
without actually breaking the wishes and respects of the family by outright telling 9 I,0.035787325
the truth so there's a sweet spot that Aquafina finds because her character is able,0.057318687
to show various levels of vulnerability based on who is around term there's another interesting,0.07765236
theme discussed in the film many of the characters attempt to uphold a cultural standard,0.009102156
that focuses on strength and sometimes not asking for help or omitting fears and weaknesses,0.098017596
this manifests itself and some of the characters behaviors and they ultimately suffer anxiety from,0.087884754
their issues that they just you know suck up and deal with rather than asking,0.6721874
for help but from a technical perspective there's two things I love about the fair,0.04479725
well in addition to what I've already mentioned I love how the film is shot,0.10336583
and I love the music the cinematography gives the film a unique visual style because,0.02424459
there's something just off about it but in an appealing kind of way many of,0.04948786
the shots are static a lot of them have characters in the frame with a,0.11289534
lot of headroom and the visuals help make the film feel off balance which is,0.015604629
how the main character Billy feels for most of the film the music also helps,0.059405956
establish an atmosphere that makes you feel like you're experiencing something uniquely cultural and different,0.056227516
than what most of us Americans are used to the music helps create an atmosphere,0.12762062
that transports you somewhere else and it also helps make those emotional beats hit that,0.15843463
much harder there's really only one area where I feel like the farewell let me,0.042745765
down I mean you could argue that it is a slow film but I think,0.15097302
the payoff you get in the final act remedies that issue a bit my problem,0.0936058
is that I didn't love the second ending I feel like there are two endings,0.082823016
to this film and the final one feels like it almost goes against what the,0.08568019
first one did and also the weight of the story I mean the filmmakers didn't,0.03456548
have much of a choice and you'll see what I'm talking about once you see,0.09253768
it but it kind of diminished the impact for me just a little bit but,0.18969059
overall I really enjoyed the farewell I think it's one of the best movies of,0.060922943
the year and definitely worth the watch as for the pros cons for the pros,0.07186874
I think the characters and performances are awesome the film insightfully discusses a lot of,0.012801502
important ideas and themes the cinematography and music are awesome and the emotion / fields,0.05510172
are definitely there as for the cons I'd say just a second ending exists for,0.07962866
a reason but I feel it does contradict the first ending just a bit I'm,0.11806536
gonna give the farewell a 9.5 out of 10 and definitely recommend you check it,0.056706436
out in theaters if you're looking for a well-made drama film this is the one,0.11632296
for you so did you guys see the farewell yet what did you think of,0.054773755
it and if not let me know why not also let me know your favorite,0.13898036
movie of 2019 thus far for me John wick 3 is still holding the top,0.053533945
spot but there's so obviously some time for it to be dethroned if possible either,0.056577586
