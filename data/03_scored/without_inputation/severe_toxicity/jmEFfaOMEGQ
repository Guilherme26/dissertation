a big fan of I like the movie Keanu I didn't love it but I,0.037178446
really think this guy's talented as well as Keegan they're both hilarious so I was,0.15515874
very curious to see where Jordan Peele could bring to a horror film and this,0.052862145
is definitely told from a very unique perspective we don't commonly see in genre filmmaking,0.019308286
at the center of the film is a Mantid in the middle of an interracial,0.06807024
relationship and he's told by a girlfriend he's about to meet her family for the,0.029625284
first time although they are unaware of the fact that he's black and so that,0.23246142
really makes him feel awkward when he gets there though all seems okay for a,0.047385022
while until he begins to realize there's some sinister stuff going on behind the scenes,0.046165742
I'm a big fan of horror you guys know that I've loved these movies in,0.13753869
my entire life and when a good one comes along it gives me the chills,0.056633737
it gives me the tingles it gives me something to think about and talk about,0.053285867
and it inspires me that's why when I saw the trailer for this movie I,0.046648
was particularly enticed because it's definitely a courageous viewpoint you don't commonly see films like,0.04085292
this told from this perspective and I got to say walking out of it I'm,0.040940057
really impressed with Jordan Peele and I cannot wait to see what else he does,0.04121345
this is a very special debut because not only does he show that he understands,0.057789158
how to direct genre films how to make a horror scene interesting or fun particularly,0.08509894
the fantastic opening scene that to my knowledge was one take which I really liked,0.030874498
but also that his singular voice can be maintained and come through your stereotypical genre,0.086978085
filmmaking because yes this film has a lot of horror tropes jump-scares things popping out,0.10051989
of you people walking past the hallway corridor accompanied by a loud jolt of music,0.04989343
but all through that it maintains its originality because of its central story and that,0.0148096485
unique perspective is told through quite a bit of racial commentary and satire because this,0.11671512
film definitely has a satirical edge to it and there are a lot of moments,0.033888444
throughout the movie they cause some serious laughter to come from the entire audience because,0.029445684
it understands that although this is a over the top for a movie with some,0.021588536
very sinister elements behind the scenes there's definitely something to be said about the awkwardness,0.047520053
that one feels when he's in the middle of something that he's not entirely used,0.02084353
to and in this case Jordan Peele had said that he does sometimes feel very,0.018586561
awkward when he's the only black person around and so we wanted to tell a,0.39387724
story from the perspective of somebody dealing with that see I grew up in a,0.013365535
very mixed race environment I had tons of friends of color so I never really,0.2501521
saw this myself personally I grew up in a very all-inclusive family that believed that,0.025364783
everyone is people we're all human and like it doesn't matter and I still feel,0.16791962
that way and I'm really really grateful for that upbringing because I've since learned as,0.03247759
an adult that that's rare so seeing a film like this can sometimes get under,0.04668791
my skin because I genuinely don't understand racism and that's because I never was really,0.09634453
exposed to it on a full scale so when I see it in movies like,0.025462564
this I have a hard time connecting with it and that's why I am so,0.029981157
glad that Jordan Peele wrote and directed this movie because he has taken this aspect,0.086053476
of the story that could get under a lot of people's skin and made it,0.100680865
so refreshing from his viewpoint because he has some amazing comic relief from lil rel,0.053795397
Howery who stole every scene he was in this guy-- look for him man he,0.21592526
is going to be in so much now he was so fricking hilarious in this,0.25403637
movie he had cane stitches in virtually every single sequence so Jordan Peele understands the,0.035444975
seriousness of this subject matter but also he is able to find considerable humor in,0.028007558
it and that was so refreshing daniel Kaluga plays the lead character and i apologize,0.032605305
sir if I said your name incorrectly I thought he was brilliant in the film,0.034649417
I didn't realize until after I saw it that he's actually from London his accent,0.07489103
is perfect I didn't even know for a second he was from the UK fantastic,0.14548165
performance Bradley Whitford is also really funny and good in this film really all around,0.04707704
the performances are very strong there's a good sense to the horror as well towards,0.03947865
the third act that builds to some really satisfying moments that had a lot of,0.02417743
people in my audience cheering as for issues with this movie there was a shot,0.2041595
in the trailer of a roaring deer skeletal monster and I was really enticed by,0.14585549
that and I was excited to see where that would play into this film it's,0.044023182
not in the movie though I hate when trailers do that when I insert things,0.07570322
in their trailer that end up just being on the cutting room floor road one,0.039978202
excuse me that was a still getting over that cold sorry also sometimes the pacing,0.050665706
does suffer there are a lot of sequences that are just very weird that are,0.06738111
meant to make you feel like you're watching a very awkward episode of The Twilight,0.03404942
Zone and sometimes it works but there are other times where you jump between tones,0.1006649
a little too quickly also there's some scares in the movie that in retrospect don't,0.024894498
really make sense there's one sequence where this guy is just running at full speed,0.041903242
towards our main character and then he just kind of darts to the right instantly,0.05612753
in retrospect once I know what's going on under the surface of this movie I,0.06897422
don't really get what's happening there it seemed like it was just a scare meant,0.033779357
for the audience and it doesn't really do much for the story I think you'll,0.021663701
enjoy yourself I'm impressed with the way Jordan Peele handled this directorial debut his voice,0.06548932
is still heard while also being a very entertaining genre film for horror fans the,0.03614076
pacing does suffer sometimes it's not a perfect tone and sometimes the humor does feel,0.1230623
