hello youtubers,0.1514806
this is Sheridan Davis again and welcome to pretty dicey and girls PG ok I am coming today to do a movie review for the film Selma iris lee it came out maybe two weeks ago I think everybody should go out to see this movie I get an A and the direct I loved her work,0.07201018
she is also the one she speeds up and slows down things,0.19244137
I love it so make sure you guys go out and see something i have on a coat because I'm so um anyway,0.17240483
so everybody go see summer it was very good,0.064122126
now when you go see make sure you have tissues ready honey cuz i cried and i'm not one of those people just cry at movies a lot behind I was in tears the first five minutes of this film like I was like bad,0.24209078
when you like that man in tears like the first time thinking like maybe I shouldn't do this review but then I thought yes I should it,0.15041697
its history,0.033578362
it's not like I'm selling a film yeah by the ship pretty much caught what happened,0.08099769
so anyway what one thing that idea learned about the film is that they highlighted the women in the movement,0.14171675
so like obviously Chris got King this Nash,0.18797082
Ralph Abernathy is wife you know things people liked it,0.11414876
so I was super excited that she um that they highlighted the women because i oftentimes when you hear about civil rights like we only think about the me and plus rosa parks slider and there were other women who were involved in this struggle,0.15875748
and in history you know with these marches and things of that nature,0.060174294
and sometimes even if they weren't on the front lines they were organizers they were getting ideas,0.09979461
they're giving the talents all that,0.06645446
so i think we often we do need to give them their activation and who are not dr.,0.14624335
king give him them Escalades as well you know not to take anything from him,0.19211185
but he wasn't after about himself,0.106916524
so I think it's amazing to just give these people highlight them if you say it was so much action in this film but it will make you because of where we are now in history,0.06735393
it'll make you appreciate where we are be grateful for those who have come before us and it'll make you know that we can't overcome like we have made some get strikes in this country,0.12577426
we have a lot more to do so it made me appreciate feel it made me know that the air gardeners Trayvon Martin my ground situations that we cannot become them too,0.055710584
and I know that we have had a difficult past with racism in this country,0.31910956
you know with I watched it with my best friend and we were sitting there thinking like man God truly it's awesome because he clearly selects when we were all born like he chooses the right people to be worn at the right time because i was thinking like if i were born during that time when I have been able to march with them like what I have been able to like stay in that race like what I have been able to be nonviolent,0.2320234
I don't think I'd have been able to do that,0.093450025
I don't know if I would have had the courage to be able to not slap a police officer at ease,0.21750365
let me or tonight um,0.0935315
you know challenge a police officer who called me girl,0.46398357
and now i'ma 40 year old woman you know,0.3008603
so I think those things are really important just to see like how far,0.059208013
we have them and like it's just crazy to me to think about the fact that man beast is not just a movie that's not just a story that came out of someone's butt this is history this stuff really heavy and it didn't happen that long ago because these folks are still alive like a lot of you people are still alive to talk about what they did,0.49455962
and some of them weren't kids like 16 17 18 years old and for them to have their college at that type of them to have that courage to march and not just to march and that's one thing i love about this that error,0.12204294
they weren't just marching to be marching because i found that a lot of us are marching to be marching,0.061307732
but we didn't march they talk to legislators,0.06258317
they were talking to people who can actually make differences,0.09497894
like if you're marching with nothing Andy,0.08370763
no um no attention all media attention no attention from your government where they flip state local or federal we're just taking a walk and saying nothing talking about saying nothing but I love that they have some force behind them,0.16721204
they were talking to the president they had something they had some but there's nothing else,0.10543466
I can take away from this family,0.24048306
it's something that the Bible says faith when our works is dead so no we're not just marching but we're marching for change and we're not just march and we're getting everybody involved,0.14054987
and i also look because we cannot in school these days we are off,0.11926623
we kind of thought that everybody was with dr.,0.050725516
King on Malcolm X and that is not how it went lips and I history way and if you go back and research you'll find that you know we always talk about black people being United,0.43148947
and you know everybody has a different mind it was not going to think like you,0.21534924
and so there were several leaders right,0.045102417
several leaders different races different sexes different colors,0.15140069
I don't everybody one way dr.,0.090421304
King if I did not agree with dr.,0.06661642
king,0.050478313
he was not the spokesman for the entire Negro race,0.7313972
there were other leaders but i did use him you know despite his flaws and his moral issues God used him mightily,0.15177174
and I think that's a great thing to point out,0.09703989
I want to have his daughter you know so she was at the Opera screening of this film,0.18981266
I wonder how she felt watching this,0.0909514
you know it can't,0.07512917
I mean he is deceased iris lee but it can't be a good feeling to know that the FBI has you know half pounds of your father shooting on your mother like I wonder have that feels is there a filament he's being passed along I wonder if her mother and we talked to them about it was there something that or if she ever dealt with it or is it something that she just like trying to like not talk about not deal with in order to say the movement and what to keep her family you know because she could have left,0.3579622
I wonder how this,0.058524042
my history would have been had these wonder who are on the front line with their hello who were fighting with their heads,0.25646272
when during these movements and their husbands were stepping out on them,0.14930734
I wonder how different history would have been if those one would have left them because they had grounds to leave them,0.14756675
I wonder how and being like it's careta diverse nothing like what we have been able to what he still had been used as he was like when he still had been a prominent figure that he looked i really wonder it so I don't know it was a really great movie,0.07744162
I think everybody needs to go see all the african-american me to go see it man,0.43988514
forget about,0.053942114
I don't want to see the word stand black movies like honestly honestly,0.48607385
there are not the Moon moves out about our history,0.072064504
we don't make that any movies period through the year,0.056582496
so we need to go see it,0.065931626
and supply if we want these actors to stay in Hollywood we want Holly watch your continued to an hour store everything we need to go support our people,0.1553617
and let me say this as well I am so disappointed in the Academy Awards,0.106847264
I am not watching it,0.10857701
I am not watching it for there to be no people of color nominated for their acting,0.57154304
I think that is utterly ridiculous data or yellow desirable,0.4682492
nomination for this movie as far as I'm concerned so that the young man who play I who play a James Brown you know there were other movies who are deserving of Oscar nominations,0.08764278
they had oscar-worthy performance if nothing else James Brown will should have been nominated for a costume and makeup honestly I am disappointed Academy Awards you guys,0.15469247
I'm horrible animation up since it's a hug,0.16497627
it's a racial ballgame period point blank because you're kind of saying then no african-american no Asian American or Latino American actors and actresses our desire of ice,0.3959213
cuz this year's no matter how how good of performances,0.13046736
they cool during the box offices or on the big screen I do not appreciate it so Academy I can go sit down,0.11485988
I will not be watching out this year,0.11353366
I hope that I only hope that Selma Texas the way this oscar for best friend but it's not and um,0.24986194
it should have been nominated for best director as well but whatever i'm not doing this,0.07520414
