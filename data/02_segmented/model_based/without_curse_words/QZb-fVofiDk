"So this is a semi Chinese movie written and directed by a Lulu Wang, and I say semi Chinese, because there is a fair bit of English in it, too, And story here follows this young woman living in New York, whose family decides to fly back to China under the pretense of a wedding and she decides to join them"
Although the real reason for them going is something else entirely
It's a bit of a secret they're keeping and something they feel I could do more harm than good if it got out
"So the movie basically follows this family as they have a bit of a reunion, and in the middle of it all is this young woman who is a bit torn on the whole idea of keeping a secret"
"She's not convinced it's for the best, but she doesn't want to go against her family either"
"that's the basic premise here, and to be fair, I was a little bit underwhelmed by it mainly because I've heard a lot of good things about this one"
"It's been very well received, but I'm not that convinced by it now"
Don't get me wrong
This is by no means a bad movie
"In fact, I liked it, but the story here was a bit underwhelming to me"
"It's very, very simple"
It's all about this family and the secret they're keeping And that's it
There's just nothing more to it And it didn't feel like it really went anywhere either
Like your plot itself almost feels non-existent It's just all about the characters and their whole family dynamic
"It doesn't feel like anything really happens and it doesn't really go anywhere, which I guess could be fine, but I didn't really even get the point, though the main characters are, and her whole storyline about her life in New York and whatnot, And I don't think it's really dug into the other characters very much"
Either
It does give most of them a little bit of depth
"They all feel unique and different, but that's about it"
They didn't really go very much deeper than that
"And yeah, at the end of the day, I guess I just didn't really get the point of it all"
"I mean, the movie is about family and about what people do to protect their loved ones or what they think is protecting them, even if that means lying and deceiving, and how they justify that to themselves and the people around them, but beyond that, I just don't really know what I was supposed to take away from this"
"However, as I said, I still didn't like it"
It's still a perfectly enjoyable movie
I thought it was pretty funny at times too
"It's also well, Act then"
"The pacing wasn't bad either, although it didn't really feel like it went anywhere, but it didn't drag or feel long"
so I guess it did something right
It's also a very good-looking a well-directed movie
"I also liked how they used the music in this, and thought the editing worked very well"
"They utilized a lot of hard cuts which can sometimes feel a bit abrupt, but in this it worked"
"Oh, and the grand mind is is absolutely adorable"
I liked her a lot
"so yeah, beyond the story stuff and a general plot which I wasn't completely sold on, I did end up liking just about everything else and genuinely don't have any real complaints about it"
"And you know what it did, have this certain charm to it as well"
"It's a very charming movie with a lot of heart and some touching moments as well, and I'm guessing that's really the reason so many people have liked this as much as they have"
It's probably also most of the reason
"I didn't really mind it either, but did I personally think it's great? No, but it's most definitely not bad either"
"However, would I recommend it? Sure, I mean, I think most people will find something to like about it, so you know, maybe give it a look or don't"
"after all, I'm not your dad"
"but hey, what are your thoughts on this? Have you seen it? Did you like it?
