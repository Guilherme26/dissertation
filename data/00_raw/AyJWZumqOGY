Smith goes to Washington he had been working steadily and everybody really adored him and in this movie he won the Academy Award now it was he always felt and I kind of tend to disagree but he felt that this was a compensation role because he didn't get it for mr. Smith goes to Washington the other nominees that year were Henry Fonda in The Grapes of Wrath who Jimmy Stewart thought should have got the Oscar and Laurence Olivier and Rebecca amongst others and Charlie Chaplin and the Great Dictator but this was his year to get it and he did it's called champagne champagne is a great level of level learning it makes you my equal I wouldn't quite say that well almost my he and his secretary Liz who's played by Ruth has a sort of an eve arden role have been signed by a scandal magazine by Cary Grant to come and wreck Tracy's new wedding to this really snobbish man that she's going to marry and having a scandal sheet there is the last thing that she wants so she decides to get the whole family to misbehave extraordinarily in front of these reporters to throw them all off the character actors in this movie I'm brilliant Roland Young who played in a movie called topper and was always playing sort of nasty English guys plays her her uncle who's always pinching all the girls you know he's thinking of behind but they'll always be pinched that you lucky dog what have you done to deserve it all and what have you and Virginia Weidler who is a wonderful child actress plays her younger sister Dinah who's sort of a wisecrack little kid and the mothers played by Mary Nash who is this is wonderful character actress who says to dine at one point a giant please don't say stains smells if necessary but only if absolutely necessary stay here oh please mother maybe he's going to talk her again don't say stop darling strike is quite an ugly enough word Katharine Hepburn has never looked more beautiful than she does in this movie the magnificence that comes out of your eyes and her voice and the way you stand there and the way you walk and with these two men opposite her they gave her the kind of support that she needed to really really shine their lit from with Anna Tracy you've got Squires Bank down in your hearth fires and Holocaust and everybody acting came up as a result this is a very very witty witty script my mum like his girl Friday and stage-door just top flight riding all the way and in fact the screenplay won an Academy Award no you're slipping red I used to be afraid of that look the withering glance of the goddess I didn't think that alcohol would oh shut up and to Kurs direction he just had a great way with comedy as we sell with born yesterday he had out a might amazing way of bringing comic actors and bringing out what was best in their performances Cary Grant has never been more dashing and handsome Stewart's never been more vulnerable and honest and Hepburn has never been more next to him would you mind doing something for me anything what get the heck out of here in George Cukor's the Philadelphia Story let's all go to the lobby let's all go to the lobby let's all go to the lobby together things to eat
