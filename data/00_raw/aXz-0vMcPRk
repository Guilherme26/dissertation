[Music] Dunkirk is a true story of 400,000 soldiers stranded on a beach desperately awaiting evacuation as the enemy slowly closes in Dunkirk as directed by the savior of Batman himself Christopher Nolan either guys how are you so before we dive into Dunkirk there's a few things I need to let you know about myself the first thing is it's four o'clock in the morning I'm drinking a Red Bull and did you know I'm utterly insane and the other thing is going into this film I wasn't as excited as I wanted to be and the last thing I wanted to let you know is I am by no means a Christopher Nolan fanboy and if you're asking yourself right now John don't you love the Dark Knight trilogy maybe more than you should and that I would say you're absolutely right I do enjoy that trilogy along with inception and a prestige but I do have issues with a lot of other Christopher Nolan films I could probably sit around for 12 hours talking about my issues with the film interstellar but I'm not going to do that I just wanted to let you guys know those things so now let's talk about the film Dunkirk now the film Dunkirk is based on true events and when you make a film like this interjecting as much realism into it as possible will always make for a better story and going into this movie I wanted to see a great war film where you got to see Christopher Nolan utilize his talents that separate him from other directors and in many ways I feel like I got the film I didn't know I wanted to see but I got it and it was told and only a way that Christopher Nolan could have made it this movie by no means is total with that standard Hollywood storytelling structure and neither is the character development and we'll talk about both those things in just one second and when it comes to Christopher Nolan he likes to bring a level of practicality and realism to his films and when you combine those realistic filmmaking techniques along with a true story the level of realism for me at least it definitely impacted me it felt real I could feel the explosions I could see the despair and when people were trying to survive and doing anything that it took I emotionally was invested just based on that because any time a filmmaker can utilize practicality in a film it will always go further telling the story then green screens or digital explosions ever could my point is whenever a film can utilize practical effects you don't feel like there's this wall of CG in front of you and the film what's that gone you feel like you're immersed into the movie and you buy into everything that you're seeing up on the big screen now let's talk about the story of Dunkirk itself this is a fascinating story and going into the movie I knew a little bit about it but I had no clue of all the elements that the film was going to include I thought the movie was going to be just about soldier stuck on a beach waiting for fisherman to come pick them up but there's so much more to this movie now when I tell you this story try to put yourself in this situation because that's what I do when I watch movies like this and it just really it sends chills down my spine because it scares me and it makes me question what I would do in these situations 400,000 soldiers are stranded on a beach desperately trying to get evacuated while the enemy surrounds them and slowly closes in and overhead there's enemy bomber planes dropping bombs on them and there's nowhere to hide and the only way out of this deathtrap is to get on one of these boats where there's not enough for everyone it's almost like the Titanic there's only so many lifeboats for the passengers on board and everyone left behind is going to die and it's not like the movie Titanic where if you pull it around on a door watching your boyfriend slowly freeze to death you're going to survive now this movie's an hour and 26 minutes long and for a nolan film that seems rather short and going into the movie i thought that might have been a weak point but after watching the movie i understand it because this movie has no filler it has no fluff it gets straight to the point and it never stops and in many ways this film is one big action sequence where you never get a chance to breathe or relax and I think that's what's so pivotal about this film is it makes you feel like you're in the situation you can feel the suspense you can feel the desperation of the characters now let's talk about the characters in this film and most importantly the character development in this movie which seems to be everyone's biggest issue with this film the film Dunkirk doesn't contain a lot of those other war film cliches that you've come to known over the last thirty years of war and most other war films to get to know the characters there is always that one scene where they're sitting down bullets are flying overhead and they're talking to each other about their lives back home there's always the intellectual guy the guy from the south who likes to go hunting and there's also always that other guy from Brooklyn who says something like this you know what I'm going to do when this was over I'm going to go back home to Coney Island and get a hot dog this big yeah they always say something like that and in the film Dunkirk there are no scenes like that because in reality which was what Dunkirk was trying to go for there is no time to sit around talking about eating hotdogs when you're trying to claw your way to survive there is no point where the characters have time to relax and share stories like that nor do they care too so when it comes to the characters and the development of the characters in this movie I learned a lot about all the main characters in this film because their actions speak louder than words one of the main characters in this film is a young soldier named Tommy and throughout the film his character is doing everything he can possibly think of to get aboard one of these ships just for a chance to survive his character is always thinking outside of the box he refuses to wait in a line with 20 other thousand guys to get aboard a ship he knows he'll never get on and the way that he thought his mindset it kind of resonated with me because I thought to myself I would probably be doing the same things he's doing to get off this Beach I understood his motivations I got him as a person true I didn't understand his hobbies or where he was from or if he had a girlfriend or not but those things weren't relevant to the situation that he was in I learned everything about him as a man that I needed to know he was a good person he wanted to help other people and on the flip side of that in the film Dunkirk you see cowards you see men that will kill and call their way to survive while they step on the heads of others to do it so as far as the character development goes in the film Dunkirk it could be considered its weakest element but for me it was one of my biggest positives with the film because I understood who these characters were in this situation and in some other films that way of storytelling you might not quite pan out but with this situation that they're in and the events happening around them it's all you needed to know as a viewer to root for them and I was rooting for this character Tommy I wanted to see him make it off of this beach and back home now this film has a lot of characters in it but I want to talk about one more main character and that's played by Tom Hart and Tom Hardy in this film plays a British fighter pilot protecting these soldiers from the sky against enemy planes and aerial attacks and every scene throughout this movie with Tom Hardy and his fighter plane having dogfights with enemy planes and protecting boats in the ocean down below were some of the best scenes in the film during some of these aerial dogfight scenes you get a POV shot of what Tom Hardy sees in his cockpit as he lines up the enemy plane in his sights before he takes it down and when I was watching it it almost gave me an adrenaline rush like I have a fear of heights and I just felt tingly all over just I really enjoyed watching that it felt like I was there it was intense it was amazing to watch I really enjoyed it and I really haven't seen a film capture dog fighting like that with a sense of realism well I guess ever I mean Top Gun was pretty good but I bought into this movie a little bit more also one other quick thing I wanted to mention about this movie is it's a pg-13 movie and it's one of those movies that definitely lends itself to be rated R because there are gruesome events happening there's bombs there's bullets there's explosions I thought the movie did a good job at showcasing how violent these events were without the blood guts and gore not to say that those things don't work in other war movies like Saving Private Ryan where the shock value is truly there but in this film I didn't think it was necessary throughout this film there are multiple storylines being told at once some of those storylines span the course of five days some an hour and they mix all those things together where you might be confused a few times throughout the movie and during the first half of the movie I had to think for a few seconds when they jump to another storyline I was like wait wait where what's happening what are we doing so that element might be confusing to some people me personally I like the way the movie was told it made it more suspenseful with that method now here my final flicking thoughts on the film Dunkirk I really didn't think I would enjoyed this movie as much as I did it felt like a true cinematic experience and it made me feel something as a viewer as a guy who just likes movies I really enjoyed the experience of watching this movie I was glued to it I was very interested now does that mean that this is a perfect movie in every sense no it's not there are a few things throughout this film that I thought could have been explained more or expanded on I also didn't enjoy one storyline it's not that it's bad but it has to do with this family on a yacht and I understand why this storyline was in the film because you need a perspective from the fishermen who are coming to save these soldiers but at the same time I guess it was the weakest part of the film or at least the slowest part in my opinion but as far as the overall tone and pacing of the film goes I enjoyed it it felt like an adrenalin ride for an hour and 46 minutes and also when you have Hans Zimmer's score playing throughout this film and you see airplanes and bombs and people just trying to survive it feels like a ticking clock counting down and you're just waiting for something bad to happen and it does over and over and over and I might just say this is probably one of Christopher Nolan's best looking films that he's ever directed and don't get me wrong I love the Dark Knight I love Inception but from a visual standpoint I feel like this movie does more than either one of those films did I'm really surprised I'm doing this because going into this film I had reservations but I'm going to get the film dunkirk Oh an A+ whoa an A+ I guess I really like that movie I can't remember the last movie I gave an A+ for but as far as this film goes it's not because I'm a Nolan fanboy that's not the reason I loved it there was no blind love towards this movie going into it once again I wasn't that excited to see the movie and the reason I gave this film an A+ is this movie met every single expectation I wanted from a war film and then went beyond those and surprised me with different elements of telling this story that made it unique that made it original in many ways where it could have been cliche and it could have played it safe but it took a chance it did something new it took out all the filler all the fluff and it made it about the event and it made you feel like you were part of it alright guys
