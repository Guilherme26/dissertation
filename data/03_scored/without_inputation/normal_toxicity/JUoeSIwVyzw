hello and welcome back to screen fanatic,0.29678807
I am knowledge and today we'll be reviewing the classic movie The Godfather,0.071859
first let me say this this movie for its time is I think it was it was it was advanced,0.1455463
it was it was ahead of allowing the other films around that time as far as filmmaking screenwriting and even producing this movie was just it had a lot of hidden gems all throughout the entire movie now the movie is four hours long,0.061592076
so it's a ton of it's a ton of just scenes in lines in the movie that just you can apply to your your everyday life as far as it's your own life,0.38188472
even if you have a family you know you have a wife you have children now to say you're doing something illegal,0.24247132
but I mean it's just it was it was very meaningful the entire movie the weight of the screen was the way that the sprint was written and just everything about the film so I'm gonna start from the beginning with this film because it it was a lot of it was just a lot of things that I had to kind of had to absorb and take in and I wanted to make sure that I got it right,0.07167229
and doing this film review because this is a very classic movie that I still love watching today and it's just it's very meaningful,0.08842614
so from the beginning um basically the director is Francis,0.04717065
Ford Coppola who's a great director and he's best known for his three Godfather films part the first part part two and as well as part three and then you also have the screenwriter which is Mario Puzo or I don't know if I'm saying his name correctly,0.13119778
excuse me if I'm butchered his name but I believe is Mario Puzo or puzzle in Mario Puzo he does this was some of his best work like I I look to my research to see what kind of work that he did on other films and he out of two other films song summer comedy,0.12467224
but this is one of the most I think this is some of his most prized work kind of like an artifact you know but I mean it was great,0.13949226
and then you had a star-studded cast you had Marlon Brando who played Vito Corleone II The Godfather did done you had a you had al pacino who played Michael Curley only the son James can he plays Santino Corleone II Sonny you have Robert Duvall who plays Tom Hagen which is the adopted son the lawyer of the family you had a Talia Shire I don't know if I'm pronouncing her name right,0.15352605
- excuse me but as she plays the the sister and but she you know if you can remember correctly she was also in the the series or the sequence of films with what Sylvester Stallone the,0.10096427
rocky she played Adrian Adrian so anyways but this is this is a great film right,0.0939834
off the get-go a scene that's very memorable for me was where were they having a,0.09751353
sit-down and one of the guys come to they arranged the meeting and one of the guys he comes to,0.12745644
thee what comes to the meeting with a proposition for the done for Vito to start selling you know start selling,0.099953234
drugs so you,0.41123378
know he has a lot of,0.06177536
very he has a lot of incentives for the Corleone family and he wants Vito to come in because Vito has a lot of politicians in his pocket and all the other five families are basically on board they're ready they're backing you know they're just waiting for Vito cause Vito out all at this time out of all the five families they all are,0.072113544
strong they have a lot of stripper Beto is like the glue Beto is,0.29142335
like the originator he's like the beginning like,0.06886735
he's like one of the first ones to really come to power within his family and to really take this done La Cosa Nostra la famiglia to the next level,0.15380533
but he's old school,0.21975218
and that's why he's been able to survive so long because he makes move,0.11261168
and he's a he's a he's very deep and thinking so they cut off,0.53490317
so all the other families are already on board they come to Vito Vito beat always the pros and the cons and he basically says the science against it,0.09189918
and I think he decides against them,0.17219564
he knows right away,0.1506775
I gotta bring in something,0.058401085
I gotta I got to I have to alert,0.09469284
some of my muscle to keep an eye on this fellow because he's not the type to take know the right,0.2409655
way correctly,0.05714827
he's the type to want to get together with the other families in and to oppose me and try to take me out,0.19013499
you know so basically that's what he does he brings in Luca Brasi and he tells Luca Brasi to kind of be like a spider going they're kind of spiky piling this guy Tony,0.15135616
you're not happy with the family,0.19117403
you know you're not happy,0.24076149
what we're doing over here,0.06295785
and to invest the report back to me so Luca Brasi does this and he says you know I'm not happy,0.06237104
maybe you guys make me an offer here and to give a more in depth perception of Luca,0.08050443
Brasi is a very big guy very muscular known for just best but he comes in when he needs to take when they need him to take care of any problem,0.08873335
that is physical,0.06767696
I mean he's a very intimidating looking individual very physically imposing,0.32751364
but the the opposition kana is able to kind of fill this out and they kind of plot a setup a plot against it to where it was no mass for three to four individuals that take him out,0.0643197
you know he tried to put up a fight,0.169643
but they're able to take him out,0.11584735
so actually I want to go back to a scene prior to that happening before this meeting is adjourned between between Vito and his and his family in the salaat see died his son Santino aka Sonny before he tells him what when he when he insists no Sonny steps up and says wait wait a minute,0.17752224
you can't you guarantee you know what he's basically hashing over the benefits in his head,0.24183251
and Vito kind of like tells him Sonny,0.11381974
you know kind of like makes him back up a little bit and he says and he tells slot-c says you have to excuse my children,0.31089434
let me try to do it in his voice,0.15414058
you have to excuse my children I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them as you can see they talk,0.24080084
when they should be listening,0.040397484
but that was a very great scene is you know eventually basically what he was saying is you know,0.073807985
he's compassionate for his children,0.102286816
he has a weakness for them,0.15258957
and in a sense they are spoiled,0.3498057
but you know you're dealing with me so but that kind of gave slot-c a little a little traction a little bit like Sonny was half of my deal you know so as you can see the wheels are already put in motion as far as all right well Vito assists no and then the thing with Luca Brasi happens and they take Luca Brasi out,0.102344684
so I really don't want to go into the movie but this is a very very clever movie,0.111671574
it's very thoughtful,0.092864774
it makes you think it makes you a pile a lot of the scenes to your own life and how you will move as far as how you would deal,0.26374733
with people is very this,0.072626896
every a lot of the scenes are about power as far as how you leverage it in your own way and to come on come out on top,0.13238642
I mean I can go on and on I mean as far as the characters you have Santino,0.10565241
you have Luca Brasi you have Clemenza,0.13112381
you have Tom Hagen you have Tesio you have Fredo which is the brother,0.19887318
and this film was very good because it focuses on character development,0.08889095
and as I've said in my other reviews that anytime the film the producers and the screenwriters take the time to really focus on character development from the beginning and how they come into play later in the film and all throughout the film makes a huge difference nine times out of ten they always make for great films,0.026805405
so I mean like,0.0962243
I said I want to I don't want to cut this films,0.2731353
I don't want to cut this review short but I want to keep it going because this is such a classic film that I don't mind going about over my normal time period as far as my reviews,0.10143326
because this I this is I owe it to this film,0.14703847
so no after you have after you have Luca Brasi taken all the Godfather is eventually gunned down,0.18232663
but he ends up surviving now in the myths in the midst of that taking place know Selassie comes to Tom Hagen and tells them all right well we know Sonny is up,0.08048863
next,0.028648289
he's he's immediately acting Godfather,0.15001723
so I want you to go to Sonny and I want you to convince some hey we don't want war but convince him to go along the plan as as I would like to do,0.13980225
so so he says okay I will talk to him,0.12315989
but you know Sonny he's very hot-headed he's very emotional,0.5154597
but let me see what I can do,0.056737594
and they know this,0.07262122
so he says I'll see what I can do,0.060172655
but even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi now,0.063405566
so Selassie is kind of a thinker,0.11732925
and he tries to he's a chess player,0.13035126
he likes to move steps ahead,0.10017274
so with them knowing this he says well you let me worry about Luca Brasi and at the time Tom Hagen is not aware of this he's not aware of this at all,0.095882215
oh excuse me for saying somebody's busted my line okay,0.23291843
so yeah,0.05474552
so Tom Hagen isn't aware of this at the moment so as their as their little rendezvous is adjourned one of his one of Selassie gods pulls over since,0.1361345
hey he lets him know he's alive he survived two men,0.36073533
you know i temped on his life he survived,0.21633872
so now this kind of ruins his plans,0.1259606
he's upset by this news and he says Tom we hit him with five shots,0.48713028
and he's still alive and he says this is gonna be bad news for me and it's gonna be bad news for you,0.40318608
if you don't get Sonny to make that deal,0.08424245
so this kind of offsets a lot of the timing and a lot of the plans that were supposed to take place,0.03670858
so after this this is this is a very key moment in the film because it's like what's gonna happen,0.06295598
this,0.05212481
you know the Kirlian currently only family member The Godfather,0.17163953
he survived but he's gonna be gone for a while cuz,0.1466289
he's an older guy,0.14032039
we gotta figure out what's going on,0.062525675
we gotta still run,0.0579307
we gotta run off the family's business and affairs all in once so within this time period you have you have Michael currently only he starts to get involved in the family business now to kind of take a few back steps,0.082576156
Michael currently owned,0.08220519
it from the beginning didn't want anything to do with the family business,0.043062996
he was very he was he was adamant about that you know,0.06800103
in fact he ended up joining the Marines or yeah end up joining Marines to kind of get away from the family business which his family didn't agree with because his father had it set up for him to go to college at Furman to be more into,0.06525826
you know governing govern government politics politics type of thing maybe like a you know a senator or a councilman a mayor or governor something to that extent,0.10819929
but of course Michael had other plans and you know he he stood strong on it,0.0625371
but when his father gets harmed he find the ins up he is a finding out through his girlfriend at the time which is Kate,0.097239286
and while they're out,0.078900374
in fact how they're finding out while they're out doing Christmas shopping,0.078172795
she just happens to take a glimpse at the newspaper and season you know be toker Leone feared be being killed by by gunfire,0.3027737
but it doesn't say whether he's dead or not,0.18729544
so she says Michael she's trying to get his attention and she shows him the paper and immediately Michael starts to panic,0.2694699
and he's very like you know distress,0.15103889
he needs to figure out what's going on with his father he stops by a payphone makes a phone call hey Sonny,0.09534309
what's going on you know is I see that pop has been shot is he in a hospital doesn't say whether he's dead or not,0.35868192
and they said yeah the old man is in the hospital but we don't know you know he looked like he may pull through but it's very you know very he's very critical at this moment,0.18400842
so immediately my co-stars to a sin he starts to step into the family business,0.14972986
giving advice no dude,0.06390303
let's try to do this,0.08100763
let's do that and at first they're kind of like kind of like waving them off Jesus love young brother he doesn't really know nothing about family it's the family business and politics as far as the affairs and how we move and do things just you know we're gonna protect them,0.08518703
he's our younger brother but kind of stay out of it you know that's how they kind of treat,0.1828147
Michael but Michael is actually giving very sound advice,0.059586138
so before that scene actually happens going back to the beginning because there's a lot of things that come into place later in the movie but going back to the beginning of the movie when Michael's is all decked out in his medals and Marine uniform he counted,0.10346667
he's telling Kay his girlfriend about a little bit about the family business because she was inquiring about Luca Brasi like I said Luca Brasi is very intimidating very physically opposing us his look he kind of gives her a little brief description on it and going into the family business and he tells Kate it's my family kids not me you know so fast for moving forward,0.102906786
so now that this is taking place,0.084281124
Michael is he's really he really wants in now he really wants to go forward and and really do all,0.07119339
he can to help,0.058031507
so upon doing this you know he he starts to really get involved in a sin and go higher and higher,0.11932207
and this is kind of like where the the film kind of transcends,0.06105656
they they their producers did a great job of shooting Michael to kind of show like wow does give great advice,0.24109149
and but a kind from this from that point on as his father is healing it they're producing,0.061334815
they kind of zoom in on Mike to kind of show like all right from this point on were kind of moving and to be into,0.0865418
the Michael Corleone II stage of the film now that kind of showed that you know he's accumulating his power and he's really just it's really,0.053310744
and he's a natural addict at being a godfather and being a nun and Michael starts to really step up and take over so I'll stop right there without going in any further because this is it's like it's a very long film,0.19989622
but it's very it's it's great,0.057597227
it's not slow at any point you won't miss you you'll be on a it's very gripping you'll be on the answer you see watching it,0.11940563
and you can watch this film over and over again,0.10263436
but this is a great film four stars like give this look film a four star rating this is like,0.046803087
I said I love watching the zoom and I kind of love love watching,0.056010593
it around family,0.06487053
you know sometimes well for the most part my family does it,0.0641876
they don't completely understand it like I do and break it down like I do,0.16587406
but that's why I'm here to do the review so but this is a great film four star rating I love,0.035107613
a lot of the scenes,0.07051438
the the discussions the side discussions that a lot of individuals are having in the scenes the roundtables where it's like a panel discussion where they're working out differences,0.09700379
I mean this is a great film from top to bottom,0.12238634
I love the way it was put together,0.09421647
I would like to see it redone in a modern version but I don't want it to take away from the original version,0.101625934
but it has to be has redone and a modern version it has to be great a as far as acting screen writing producing directing it has to be up to par it cannot say oh man they should have just never remained it you know,0.14906812
but if that's the case then don't remake it because this such a great film I mean I love our Pacino,0.07149516
I mean every all the characters were you know you could see how they all come into play,0.07981262
this was an outstanding film for from producing to directing to oscar-worthy performances from the actors from a lot of this the screen shots with the way they were able to capture different moments in the film how the by them doing,0.057753384
so it kind of focuses all more so on the actual scene or the purpose of the character versus them giving a dot a specific type of dialogue,0.0716434
but don't get me wrong the dialogue was also great too,0.08052507
