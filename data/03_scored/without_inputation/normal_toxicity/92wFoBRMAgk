a star is born as the directorial debut of Bradley Cooper and his stars Bradley Cooper and Lady gaga he tells a story of an aging musician who finds a young singer and falls deeply in love with her and therefore helps her find fame even as age and alcoholism start catching up to him and send his career on a downward spiral guys I'm going to start off by saying that star is born' is one of the best films of 2018,0.09820024
one of the things that Bradley Cooper does so well is that it skips all those cliche things that you've seen in films like this before the meeting the falling in love,0.0945438
they're starting to dwell on the bad things of a relationship,0.119316414
it skips to do that mostly in the first 45 minutes and then it just dives into who these characters are as a unit as individuals what their unique careers look like separately and what their personal lives look like together,0.058999587
and this is a very intense drama,0.10690818
it's a rollercoaster ride of emotions that is so raw,0.16457127
so pure,
so visceral Bradley Cooper has an amazing debut as a director probably the best one I've seen in quite a while he mostly utilizes handheld close-up shots that gives you that visceral values just feel the sweat on the characters face you feel like you aren't there with them and you're living through these moments with them,0.1403006
and they are so rewarding throughout the film not only does he directed some really,0.049877994
well he knows what actors need to give great performances,0.09154059
and he gives a great performance himself probably the best one I've seen in his career but he also allows everyone to give a phenomenal performance no matter how little their time is on screen Sam Elliott is great,0.05958627
and you Dice Clay is so good and let's talk about the star of this movie Lady gaga,0.38778138
no pun intended but she is in sync with every little bit of nuance that her character is going through in this film,0.132167
she has a phenomenal debut,0.08647393
this is one of the year's best performances,0.055354726
if not the best she's pure power in this film she is you feel her pain you feel her victories,0.28943542
you feel every little bit of sorrow that you need to feel for her especially one particularly hard scene in a certain ceremony that I will not spoil here,0.21732111
it's just hard to watch because you already feel so much for these characters I don't need to say much about the music this film is actually not selling you very much on the music is just selling you on the drama which is fantastic superbly done drama,0.13700043
but the music is fabulous as well you'll be singing,0.104375415
so much of this music in your head,0.4057751
and that's what a good movie driven by music should do,0.08463213
and for those of you worried that Bradley Cooper is a country star in this film who is not I was expecting intervene but writers movie begins I'm like oh yeah this is not country this is hard rock and I love that about this,0.06590535
he's certainly a country boy,0.08844551
and that's something that's very integral to who he is in this film the character but he's not a country singer,0.094518505
and those of you who don't like country music will be pleasantly surprised the movie just spits you hard,0.4842352
it gives you this white-knuckle feeling throughout,0.31997925
I was on the edge of my sit leaving through every emotion that these characters were living through and enjoying it again,0.06824049
it's a roller coaster ride of emotions I do have two very particular nitpicks with it,0.12718464
there are moments in this film where it gets really heavy in terms of emotion,0.05828373
and I just wish I could have dwelt a little bit more into that it cuts away and you understand why in the context of the film,0.07347524
and what the story is about,0.050663654
but I just wanted to be there a little bit more to really take me over the cliff if you know what that means and near the end of the film again,0.10311482
I'm not going to spoil anything,0.14653419
but when I send this movie skips over all the cliches in this particular type of plot,0.16996484
it does have one scene that felt very abrupt in terms of how cliche very in-your-face it was and I just didn't feel like this movie needed it,0.077943064
I felt like this movie all around was better than this particular scene a star is born as a story that inherently has something different to say to each generation which is unsurprising giving how many times this movie has been remade,0.095684126
and this is probably the best version of it the music is the best on all the versions the performances the film as a whole just works magnificently,0.04670748
well you will remember this film in Oscar season for performances for music for direction,0.05882359
and I'm going to give a star is born a collector's item now for those of you who've seen it,0.16076857
