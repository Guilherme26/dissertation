hey guys it's Mariana and today we're talking about Mad Max fury road this movie,0.19118232
is directed by George Miller just like the previous three and it stars Tom Hardy,0.052270796
Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult now I went into this movie with really high expectations,0.11639325
because not only wasn't excited after watching the Mad Max trailers which I thought looked,0.16864106
awesome and I never got tired of seeing those trailers but I also was really,0.089158334
hyped up just all my own because I'm marathoned the first three Mad Max movies,0.15513459
right before I went to see Mad Max fury road so I had pretty high,0.15802774
expectations for this and this movie still blew my mind I am so excited about,0.17450462
this movie that I can't even begin to tell you and I am obviously going,0.24254593
to try to tell you because I'm doing a review but yeah I'm excited my,0.14267327
first thought after the movie ended was how am I ever going to watch another,0.070425026
action movie because this film was everything I wanted it to be and more the,0.103694975
premise of this movie is pretty simple we have Tom Hardy as Mad Max who,0.24166057
by the way looks fine who is captured by this group of really strange people,0.079539314
who are ruled by a crazy looking dude with a skeleton mask on his face,0.794439
you probably remember him from the trailer you can't miss him he looks crazy and,0.5938913
fun fact he's actually played by the same actor who played the villain in the,0.13073552
first Mad Max movie which they're completely different people but it's still kind of eight,0.251686
so this group of people almost feels like a cult because they pretty much worship,0.31089434
their leader and then one of the people there is Shirley's Erin's character furiosa and,0.08156484
she is actually trying to get out of that situation and so we have her,0.09230627
getting out the crazy people chasing her and Max is kind of just caught between,0.44269815
the two sides now if you have never seen a Mad Max film before the,0.10116979
trailer is a very accurate representation of this movie it is crazy chaotic insane post-apocalyptic,0.48461354
action that's what this movie is I absolutely love the world George Miller created for,0.081870675
the Mad Max franchise it is so weird and so crazy and if you're somebody,0.53490317
who enjoys dystopian post-apocalyptic worlds I think you're going to find this fascinating there are,0.26709893
so many crazy details and you can tell that every single thing and every single,0.37528944
person in this world has some kind of function like they're not just there to,0.15327708
look crazy they actually have a backstory and a reason to be there the action,0.36539093
in this movie like I said before is mind-blowing it is beautiful first of all,0.19802584
it looks realistic it looks like something that can actually happen it is not all,0.05877407
green-screen CGI it looks amazing people get hurt things break not that it's great when,0.083830066
people get hurt but you know what I mean like we don't have invincible characters,0.31089434
which is so annoying in action films I was legitimately concerned about everybody in this,0.18609758
movie because people then just walk things off second of all there's none of that,0.099467374
shaky-cam stuff that is so annoying in movies these days you can see everything that's,0.31089434
going on you can see these beautiful shots of chaos unfolding in front of you,0.367429
and there is this one particular scene that really had an effect on me for,0.07668495
some reason because it was towards the beginning it is a scene where the characters,0.07347013
go into a sandstorm and it just looks like all hell broke loose on earth,0.46585515
this movie also has an amazing soundtrack which is something that I wondered about because,0.10016289
often I see trailers using music that isn't actually in the movie and I can,0.043804944
tell you that the epic music from the trailer is in the movie and it,0.08130242
is stunning it just all fits together there's even a guy in this movie whose,0.15300843
sole purpose is to stand on top of this truck while it's driving places and,0.0680966
to play an electric guitar that also spits out fire occasionally that is how crazy,0.44862354
this movie is and I was a big fan of this guy because that was,0.18628678
just wild of course all of the actors did an amazing job Tom Hardy as,0.14731584
Mad Max is really solid I really like Tom Hardy but I was a little,0.10409494
bit concerned about him because Mel Gibson as Mad Max is excellent but I was,0.31089434
pretty impressed Charlize Theron s furiosa is pretty much the ultimate badass and then Nicholas,0.23972875
Hoult plays this really insane character it's great they all did a fantastic job I,0.3554774
have nothing bad to say about this movie now the question that you might be,0.13550732
asking yourself is whether or not you need to see the original three movies to,0.098509245
watch Mad Max fury road and my answers is yes and no if you're concerned,0.2381745
that you're going to be confused about what's going on like the plot is going,0.091569245
to not make sense you don't need to see them this movie stands perfectly on,0.13900383
its own however I would definitely recommend seeing the original three movies a because they're,0.07074789
great movies well third ones kind of rocky but it still has really good moments,0.085314244
be it's really interesting to observe the progression of this post-apocalyptic world because you can,0.08126668
see things getting worse and worse with every movie and crazier and crazier so that's,0.5154597
really interesting and in the second movie Mad Max road warrior you also get to,0.15352635
see a little bit of the history of how things happened so if you're interested,0.08209852
in that definitely see the first three movies and also you don't get as much,0.10715642
character development with max in this particular movie they kind of go over his origins,0.15065195
a little bit in the beginning however if you want to know how this guy,0.10365567
went from a pretty normal person who was a reckless cop to this insane shell,0.5154597
of a man you obviously need to watch the previous movies so for plot you,0.16283996
don't really need to see them but you really should see them now guys because,0.12860031
I'm apparently a very mean and demanding movie watcher and reviewer I have not given,0.08021089
a single 5 out of 5 rating to a movie that I saw that came,0.09044937
out this year and Mad Max fury road gets five out of five stars from,0.14900121

go see this movie in theatres as soon as you can it is awesome I,0.13318627
definitely want to see it again and I will definitely be buying it on blu-ray,0.09214415
