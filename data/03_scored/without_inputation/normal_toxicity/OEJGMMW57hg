actor Mark Ruffalo was fantastic as the heart of this movie and Rachel McAdams character shares a scene with her grandmother in this movie that is so powerful,0.22072989
it's only 15 seconds long and there's no dialogue but it is so emotionally powerful,0.1223772

and Liev Schreiber was great as the editor of the Boston Globe but he could have portrayed the editor very cliche like JJ from spider-man or Perry White from Superman,0.12477619
who's always angry,0.1840053
and always looking for that next story but Schreiber plays the editor so introverted and so soft-spoken hmm have I mentioned how amazing,0.077585205
the acting was the cinematography is also brilliant in this movie because again it doesn't feel like you're actually watching a movie it actually feels like you're watching real life but they also do a great job of showing how influential the Roman Catholic Church is to the city of Boston,0.083280884
there were several exterior shots in this movie where our characters would be walking down a street,0.11066203
