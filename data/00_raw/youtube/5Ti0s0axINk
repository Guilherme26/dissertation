you would think that after three versions three high-profile versions of this exact same story well actually Bradley Cooper has made a significant change which we'll discuss in just a moment but anyway you would think at this point there wouldn't be any magic left in this story but you would be wrong and what makes this version of a stars born truly shine is the following first off a movie star truly is being born here with Lady gaga you know Bradley Cooper kind of short changes are within the movie but I think he makes up for it by giving her you know like setting her on her way as a movie star right if you I mean the movie focuses more on Bradley Cooper which might disappoint some Lady Gaga fans but little monsters if you've come to worship at the altar of Gaga don't worry you'll get in a lot of praying you'll have you'll have your religious experience watching this movie then ask for Cooper he's definitely given himself the role of his career the sound design is really really good I mean I know it's a movie about the music industry but I didn't expect the sound to be that good very very good make sure you buy tickets for a theater that has a very good sound system the press screening was anna dolby atmos made a difference that also finally it's a sophisticated realistic depiction shockingly realistic and sophisticated actually of what it means to be a successful artist particularly in the music business today now speaking of Cooper what did he do what did he do well as the director co-writer and one of the film's producers for the first time ever in this story the older male role is made to be extremely sympathetic in the past he's been under the character's unsympathetic villified almost even and is really horrible in his treatment of the young female ingenue right and also in the past his character who's been a husband you know his career is really on the rocks but here Bradley Cooper's career is actually in pretty good shape and he things never really get that bad to be honest with you and so the reason I'm bringing this up at the front of the review is that it makes a huge difference in the movie and the movie as I said actually leans more towards Cooper than it does Gaga when in the past the female character has really been the focus and also even more so because this is still a very sad story bring tissues someone asked me how many tissue should I bring the whole box but so well you might also get a little bit annoyed particularly if you're a Gaga fan but between the two people someone's got to look worse than the other one and since Cooper is practically playing a Christ figure Gaga comes off as John grateful and uncaring especially in the third act I actually thought uncharacteristically so for how kind her character was in the beginning in the moment so yeah basically what you have here is that Bradley Cooper and taken no chances that someone else is gonna win an Oscar for his movie okay he is definitely stacked the dick I also have to say that the movie is way too long and the problem there is that it feels too long right and it could easily lose half an hour easily lose half an hour but thankfully there are such brilliant moments throughout like breadcrumbs right combined with powerhouse performances you're still kept engaged in the core of the film naturally is Cooper and Gaga's relationship which seems so deep and so real that it's a credit to both actors and also Cooper's directing of the scenes it's really good stuff now Cooper is doing a mean Sam Elliott impression and Sam Elliott by the way is in the movie playing his brother and there's even a commentary on the fact that Bradley Cooper's doing a Sam Elliott impression yeah Cooper brings vulnerability and kindness to the role and he ultimately moves it beyond just being a Sam Elliott impression and he breaks your heart again unless you're Lady Gaga fan and you're like want you to go Gaga but he his character I thought was just so charming but also speaking of breaking your heart he also delivers an incredibly convincing and realistic portrayal of an addict not just the behavior but the motivations to do such things and also the repercussions of the whole situation really interesting then with gaga all right so she starts out on her only false note in the movie and I feel of Cooper was a little more protective of her he would have you would have changed the scene and it's a short scene clearly written by a group of men three men wrote this screenplay for a woman because any woman will tell you that we don't go into the ladies room and scream amen we just don't do it we might be thinking it sometimes we don't really verbalize it like that it just rang false but for the rest of the film she is luminous and you know what I enjoyed the most about her performance not the singing watching her character think that was really cool particularly in the early stages of her relationship with Cooper when I guess the focus was a little bit more on her to some degree but she was trying to figure out the enigmatic celebrity sitting across from her why is he talking to me what does he want right we'll talk about that at the end but then also the added layer of difficulty that she's dealing with somebody who's drunk you know and also not only that that's tough to do but how she feels about it you know that's a that's a lot to take on and it's a risky road to go down but I think to her character's credit she goes down it with her eyes wide open so I thought that was all great and that all came from Lady Gaga's performance also I have to add when her character starts to mimic Gaga's actual music career and those of her peers in the music business you know in this I'd say maybe the second half of the movie right you can tell that the commentary which is not flattering uh-huh skirts a little too close to home for gaga and I think she's made a little uncomfortable by being asked to to be the face of that commentary right and I think she isn't quite sure how to play it either which makes the second half of the movie not not as strong for her as the first that is for the music I'm not a big music person but I will say that I was impressed because you know get a more into story and and movie movie making and stuff like that so impressed me the most music wise was Cooper's ability to capture the feeling of being in a concert right both in the audience and also backstage and not just backstage from having VIP access that was done very well you were like oh let's go this is gonna be so great like when she goes to his first concert he invites her there's like almost like a Cinderella type feel to it it was really really cool and then after that sound design as I said the press screening was an Adobe Atmos theater and for some moments my seat actually throbbed from the music it was really cool you felt like you not only were at a concert but you had want the best seat in the house as for the actual singing though I like shallow quite a bit I don't see how anyone could not like shallow it's a very good song and also Gaga's chabuk charming performance at the drag bar and also the scene that follows that backstage between her and Cooper that kind of like makes for a great package but otherwise I thought the music wasn't particularly distinct it's not like greatest showmen like for me at least I wouldn't I wasn't like I must buy the soundtrack I was like I'm are they so I mean they also don't seem particularly original you know so you're like is this like a song someone else's song I don't know uh although there's also I have to say one song that she sings that's supposed to be bad and oh boy is it a stinker it was awful and like and I think that's part of why she was like uh you know I have to see these people in the music business Bradley when I go back you know I'm still kind of in both I have a foot in both places so they're gonna be like with the creature you saying something about me when you did that performance right like I don't know it was it was awkward okay but I have to say also as impressive as Cooper's acting is I dare say his directing is even more impressive he not only does the story justice but it's able to package it in a way that indeed elevates it to awards caliber material I mean oh I've always said to you that you know directors they have a responsibility to present something as awards worthy like this is special pay attention this is a film for the ages and I think Cooper very much does that maybe that's why you made it too long I think someone should have been like perfect it's a real challenge though at the awards situation though because this is the fourth telling of the story and the three previous ones were all major awards contenders but despite a slew of nominations no version is ever won a major Oscar one of the major categories I think the highest has ever gone is screenplay and while I feel that shallow is a shoo-in for Best Original Song I'll certainly be nominated so Gaga and Perkin sing at the Oscars right but I'm curious to see if Cooper's version can go beyond nominations and finally bring home some gold in a meaningful way it's certainly his intention to either get director or actor right now though I don't think think we have a good enough feel for the playing field so we'll have to wait and see how it shapes up finally and I this is this is tough but it was struck me so much while watching the movie I wanted to discuss it here I have I have to comment on the me2 aspect to the film which haha which highlights why the me2 movement has sent the entertainment business particularly hard and that's because there's often absolutely no line between professional and personal and it's a bit uncomfortable especially because of what's what's being discussed and what's happening today right to watch their first night together as under the circumstances a very different movie could easily have her claim years later that she wasn't willing to sleep with him he wouldn't have helped her career and that's the case that's clearly the case that would be a correct accusation in this situation and I'm not saying the Cooper's character is vilified here by any means that just happens to be his motivation if he didn't think she was hot he would not have helped her if he wasn't interested in her physically you know and you know it turns out here fortunately there was a romantic aspect to it as well but there often isn't right but I think because of that the scene actually does an amazing job of showing how grey perhaps too gray the entertainment entertainment business is instead of black and white when it comes to professional versus personal it's like I would say that this is like again has a Cinderella type quality to it points but like 99% of the time it doesn't turn out like this so I would I would hate to think that this would kind of romanticize something that it should not so just make sure that you know just like Lady Gaga's character goes into the relationship with her eyes open you know make sure that you're really aware of what's going on in someone's intentions it's it's complicated but that's good I think I think the movie is it's complex but I think there might have to be some commentary on that and if there's if there's anything that could potentially undercut this for award season it might be that the potential romanticizing of that aspect but anyway that's my review of a star is born I'm very curious to hear your thoughts down below save those spoiler comments though for the spoiler review you know those are for those who aren't familiar with the star is born' story you don't want to ruin it for them right and then of
