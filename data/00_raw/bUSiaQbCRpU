[Music] [Applause] [Music] yo what's up team your boy j-3 is back in the building you guys know what time it is it is time to review toys 34 but before I do that I gotta give a big shout out and a thank you to dr. Manhattan for sending us to go see toys three four this video is dedicated to you and I hope you enjoy roll the trailer everyone body made a friend in class making friends no no she literally made a new friend I want you to meet porky he's a spool buddy we have a situation I am NOT a toy I was paper soup salad maybe chili and then the trash but we gotta get pork or bourbon even though the trailer looks cool fun and loving this is still a non needed film and I fear that this movie could possibly hurt one of the most epic trilogies of them all let's talk about the casting slash voice acting this film is starring Tom Hanks Tim Allen Annie Potts Keanu Reeves Christina Hendricks keegan-michael key Jordan Peele Tony Hale and many many more and I have to say hands down this is a great cast for this film they did a phenomenal job I love the voice acting I just felt so connected to these actors as these characters and they brought this movie to life for me it was the best part of the film for me and Keon Michael key stole the show for me I'm just a he was the duck and he was the funniest part to me he made me smile the most watching this film I had so much fun with Keegan Brooke I was shocked I was like God death take me back I wished him and Jordan pillar and the other ones they just brought so much light to this film their voices just feel it felt so warm and dope hearing those two together and how their characters were if it was like watching key and Peele but twice three four and I really enjoy seeing the mango nya angle a lot but the voice acting was on point hands down Tom Hanks you guys know number two on my top my top 10 best actors in the world bro you know he's number two - me and Tom Hanks never disappoints with that voice oh my gosh he is woody to the end and nobody could ever take that from me personally I enjoyed hearing these actors play these characters hands down you guys you guys get one of these you're gonna get four because there's part for tight let's talk about the directing / visuals this film is directed by Josh Cooley and I have to say his directing style mixed in with these visual was on point probably the best visually looking choice stories I've ever seen hands down do to 2019 this is keeping one honey we're not a ninety five but this film just looked so good the CG was just phenomenal the movement was crisp the the colors were popping it was very vibrant it just looked that damn good and shout out to you Josh because you did a good job directing this movie and I really appreciate it the way you directed it you you did your best to make the Oder audience feel what the younger audience is about to feel you know I mean we're older now I was there 95 baby you don't say it and for me to come in and still get some of that direction where it feels familiar I like that and I appreciate you for doing that the visuals on point it's Toy Story for baby Oh point let's talk about the music Randy Newman came back to do the music for tour story for and I have to say with the much up respect for any look me because no one could do it like this clearly I will go say no more no one could do that like when you Norman Newman but this music was whack in this film did not care for him at all in this movie he was a shell of what that in 95 was it just did not feel organic new vibrant it felt like let's throw him in to make people feel like the old-school Toy Story and that's what the much up respect no disrespect to him at all but it was just like shut up I'm done this music does not this film does not deserve Randy Newman in this at all it's not a Randy Newman type of movie it just did not feel right it felt forced it was like alright we get it we get it you want to bring up a familiar voice music-wise to this to the story I did I understand it but wrong movie for this music I just I was like honey shut up goddang stop singing I felt like Family Guy on apocalypse episode y'all know back then it was like stop it huh gosh freak alright let's talk about the story let's talk about the script story this story was created by eight individuals yes eight people had their hands in the cookie jar and it felt like eight people had their hands in the cookie jar this was a terrible disrespectful spit in the face story and the reason why because it felt like these eight individuals didn't know where they were going and why they were doing it and what Toy Story really meant to the viewers I don't compare films but this is a fourth installment of previously being one of the most epic franchises ever one of the most epic trilogies ever and because of this story it has tainted this epic Toy Story franchise for me this story was rushed pointless and disconnecting to me as a viewer I've watched Toy Story and adored the stories of Toy Story since 95 and I'm keeping one honey cuz I don't want to get emotional but Toy Story is very emotional to me because I collect toys I love toys and since 95 it has always been one of my favorites I go and watch Toy Story when I feel is sad when I'm angry alongside with Land Before Time I love those movies and when you when you watch it and you see the trash and the disrespect that they give them characters like wait and Buzz and they just sit on them and just put their fit and a step on those characters oh it's disrespectful and I hate it I hate it and I'm pissed off because I didn't ask for this movie but I was willing to give it a chance because I honestly was like yo you know it's cool let's find out what happened to Bo Peep I'm okay with both peeping in his movie I'm gonna carry with Bo Peep in his movie but the disrespect to woody my favorite character and how they set him back in this story and just pushed agenda after agenda I couldn't I didn't understand you I'm like why I didn't go in this movie looking for something I was just giving something and how it just disconnected with me I just felt bad for me and the future of kids this story was terrible this is not a good movie when it comes to story and script they try to force emotion in this movie they got emotion they got anger not happiness or sadness I'm pissed off by this trash story Toy Story 1 myths under to me it meant something because I understood it the development of how they came up with this movie was phenomenal a toy gets replaced let's tell a story about how a toy feels when they get replaced and how every other everything around it enjoys the new you know I'm saying they enjoy that sheet and seeing woody get replaced and having to overcome that and going with witty through his journey to become friends with buzz I thought was tight yo I'm like that's real life that's how it happens you could be the top dude in school and somebody cooler comes and everyone loves that cool guy and they kind of put you in the back and you're like I got it I'm cool too don't remember me and how you two become friends after all that she and become best friends it's beautiful Toy Story 2 becoming a collectible that's a life span of a toy you get so old you become a collectible as beautiful seeing woody my favorite character become a collectible item not knowing where he came from figuring out all this stuff and accepting the circumstances and his friends coming to rescue him because they know he was stolen and then not just that they go through an epic journey I'm playing catch with my dad they go to a toy store just beautiful and then it is with it is with it ends with part three what happens to a toy when you grow up most toys get thrown away so we're giving away they gave the toys away to a freaking daycare and seeing how the toys interact from being number one to being wrecked by little kids spit on toe up just tow the toys up and lots o to bear bro just being a hater seeing the journey find a way back to Andy's house and then what are you doing you just grow out of your toys you find another little kid and you give your toys away you give your toys away to somebody else because you cherish that I still got my first teddy bear sitting right there I 9ne call me selfish I'm doing a sheep but I understand they give they towards the bunny and she loves the toys and then we get this trash story and part 4 where she makes a fork spoon 40 sport whatever and she loves the sport more than those toys and he doesn't want to be a toy he keeps running away and what he keeps putting himself in lost danger to keep retrieving this stupid fork this is stupid fork it has nothing to do with anything Toy Story related this was a disgrace and despicable trash story /script i enjoyed by a bow peace journey but goddamn what about woody they sad all over witty he took the back seat in this new world we live in and I'm gonna say and I try not to say because I try to see the brighter side of life but this whack sjw [ __ ] that we dealing with I'm sick of it I am sick of it I am tired of it they set woody back wait he is a leader and I would have loved to see winning a boat people eat together not him sit in a backside this man this toy has found his way home three films and alone TV specials and now he just wrecked body needs us body [ __ ] Fred Barney men trash story trash script I can't believe that Disney milked a cow like this is so hurting I was there in 95 yo I was there when it all began me and my little brother VHS the mobile big old dick man Toy Story had the best line of stories anybody could ask for and Disney this is the third and this is a third franchise they have ruined with their agenda based films trying to please an audience who don't even watch these films who don't even buy these toys who don't even care about these characters stop appealing to people who don't even have we don't care about this [ __ ] and it hurts when you hear when you watch and you see what they have done to Toy Story God leave and I told dr. C and I told David I was like why I gotta be to win cuz it just sucks that no one is speaking on this crash Toy Story 4 story is script it just just pissed all over what they had they brought to life and I hate it this is the worst toy story film period it has good elements but overall Toy Story meant something it wasn't it didn't mean something visually it means something just by the acting the voice act nah it was the story that made you feel something in the way part 3 ended with that story man then it came this trash dan let's talk about pros let's talk about cons the pros of this film is the voice acting I thought the voice actors did a phenomenal job vibrant like I said Keegan stole the show from me he was funny breath of fresh air I wish they had you're keeping the Jordan Peele and keegan-michael key and the other toy stories I thought they would have brought something magical to that because I felt like out of everybody else even even though I love Tom Hanks I felt that they took a backseat and key and Peele really cared about being in this movie more than any other voice actors to me everything they did hit hard it was like okay all right just everything about them from that voice was just there and you could tell that the way they came off they really wanted to be part of this and to me it felt like to them it wasn't just a job it was let's let's try to make this tight I think I could put my swag on this and be tight let's talk about the cons the story the disconnecting factor of this story is a con for me hearing all these these people raving over this movie oh my god it was so hard Phil oh my god I feel so bad miss me with that trash this story was garbage and it messed this whole movie up I don't want to spoil anything but there were certain scenes in here that I was like why did you do that why would you do that why would you frickin do that that doesn't make any sense who does that we live in a world that is falling apart and I'm seeing it through film first we cannot keep appealing to people who don't even care who just want to be seen who don't care about anything else but just being seen this agenda based stuff and these movies look every every film even back in the day everything had an agenda but you know what there was one thing about class and agenda this film had no class with his agenda we got very little of the crew another kind I come to see woody buzz Rex slinky Jesse bullseye I came to see my favorite characters and I didn't even get them I got all these new characters which I had I liked the duck in a rabbit but damn what about everybody else we spent too much time on a spork a trash eating loving land in dirt spork that was the spit in the face disconnected immediately I just can't take it I am very sad what they have done with this let's give this film a grade I love the voice acting they did a phenomenal job the directing was cool visually dope you know I'm saying 2019 they got the money they got the works it's gonna look tight but this movie doesn't base off of action and tight looking boys acting means something but the story is script and the musical just was not there it just wasn't there and it hurts because you need music to build the climactic scenes so you can feel the emotions you need a good story to blend in with the music so you can feel the emotions that's the beauty of Toy Story because it doesn't matter how old you are what color you are what race you are what we're living you believe in we all had toys before that's the beauty of Toy Story it's one of the one things that everybody can appreciate a love for toy and watching that journey and they just sit it all on that cebra and I can't believe how they did them just milking the cow like what the Freak why would you do that with that said y'all I'm gonna give this movie got my hands moving in so you gotta hear I'm trying to hold it in I'm gonna give this movie a c-minus is the worst Toy Story film this movie gets a c-minus it is terrible guys when it comes to Toy Story hope you guys enjoyed my review if you're new to the channel go ahead and push that subscribe button thumbs up this video don't forget to share Instagram Facebook Twitter shout-out to dr.
