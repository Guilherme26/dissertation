"Hey, guys, I meant to get this review up during the week and so I apologize for that, but hey, better late than ever, right Iliza, honey, he's coming for you"
"So the shape of water is a new romantic, fancy drum that is directed by Guillermo de Torres, Also Corinne by him that features in Some Will cast that includes Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stolberg, Michael Shannon and Octavia Spencer, and in the Ship of Water we follow Elisa, play by selling Hawkins, a mute person that communicates through sign language that works at this government lab with her friend, play by Octavia Spencer, and the scientists bring in this creature, played by Doug Jones, who forms a relationship with Elisa"
"Amongst other things that happened in this movie, Alrighty guys, so let's get into the shape of water"
"So I was looking forward to this movie for two specific reasons and one of them, of course, was because it was directed by Guillermo del Toro, who has one of the best directors working today"
Another reason why is because when I watched the trailer it gave me the vibe of Beating the Beast means Bioshock
"So with all those reasons combined, I was hyped and I gotta tell you guys, the shape of water was damn excellent, so I have won the acting in this movie"
"Every single performance in this movie is Oscar-worthy There is a single hormon to this movie that is lower than good, or even subpar"
"Everywhere in this movie is giving it there a game, from Sally Hawkins to Richard Jenkins to Michael Chan to Michael Stoler, to Octavia Spencer, even to Doug Jones, who plays the creature"
"Everybody in this movie is oscar-worthy But if any actors in this movie have high chances of getting an Oscar nomination, it's easily Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins and Michael Shannon, But if I were to single any actor to get a nomination to possibly win the Nos ker, it's Sally Hawkins in this movie"
Sally Hawkins in this movie is magnetic
"Despite Sally Hawkins not saying a single word throughout this movie, She's able to give one of the best performances that only had this year but her for a career"
"I'm saying that, without a doubt, there is a moment in which she conveys her sign language that had me cheering and laughing"
This moment was absolutely incredible
I hope that Sally Hawkins gets nominated for Best Lead Actress
"I mean, God, she was greatest film"
"But if I were to sing a lot somebody else, it would easily be Michael Shannon"
"This dude I don't know is about him, but he plays a villain so damn well and film and yours thing, despite how filthy he is, you understand intentions, you see where his goals come from, and you honestly see his point of view, despite him treating this creature so terribly, and Doug Jones in this movie as the creature Pam and Sally Hawkins romance in her body"
"In this movie, It's just so damn sweet"
"Despite this movie being a creature in human romance, Jim, Aldo Toro is able to make this romance so just he's able to make the romance Elma in this movies so fresh, and he's able to make this romance"
"I know I said, pathetic brain is able to make it just so sweet"
Another thing I love about Elisa and the creatures romance was the fact that it was a romance that made these two complete
"You can totally tell that before this creature came along, Elisa wasn't feeling complete her life"
"You know like that, the life, No joke or the Dark Knight Saying you complete me, you can clue too"
But that's how Lisa feels about this creature
Once that creature comes up when you see her brighten up
It only elevates this movie so much more
The romance part
This movie was my favorite part of this movie and I wanted to see more of it now
If there is one thing that I always look forward to when I come to Newt Gilmore the horror film
"It's the look of the film and it's the production design, and my God does demote or knock it out of the park again, because with a I doubt, the shape of water is one of the best looking films of twice empathy, not just from what's Emmet ography, but the just luscious productions"
"and like I mentioned before, when I watched this trailer for this film, it gave me a Bioshock vibe, and from the aesthetic of this movie, just the production design alone"
This movie screams Bioshock
"If he was inspired by Bioshock for the production design, I would not be surprised, and that would be absolutely shocked that this film was not nominated for best production design"
"Because this film is a beauty to look at, and the cinematography"
This movie's not just from all the framing but the color palette
"This movie is just so beautiful to look at, and not to mention the cinematography for the water scenes"
The opening shot of this film is one of the most amazing shots of the year This shot I want
"So they pulled it off, and another thing I loved about this film was the creature design for the crucial that Doug Jones plays"
This creature is so damn cool
It's like a combination of
"like the creature, The Black Lagoon, Black Lagoon"
"This creature is like a combination of The Creature from the Black Lagoon, and also, I guess a mermaid of sorts"
What do you see? This creature Do its thing
These moments this movie are just moments that put me in awe
Another thing I absolutely loved about the Ship of Water was a score by Alexander
"Display the score to play it in simple terms, was just absolutely lovely"
Every time I heard that old 60 sound come into play
This film is the biggest smile on my face
just hearing old 60s music done by Alexander display in this film
Just it was just delightful to put into words
"and another thing I am, she loved about the shape of water, And it's a term"
"I haven't used that much to script my movies this year, And it's that there are so many scenes and there are so many moments of the spill that are that I described as just Hollywood movie magic"
There are so many scenes of this movie that just made me feel like just old-fashioned film
Make these scenes
I can only describe them one word
and that was just magic Now
"In terms of flaws for this movie, I do have a few now"
"Despite that, the romance is a focus of this film"
So this movie does take place in the 60s
It does focus on other things that happened to safeties
Like the Cold War is a focus of this movie
as are homophobia and racism
There are scenes that do tackle those things
"and while this film does tackle those parts of the Sixties very well, I feel like the film doesn't give the romance nearly enough attention as it should"
"As the film goes along, I feel like it did get a little predictable, particularly in the final scenes"
"Overall, Guys, aside from its flies, the Shape of Water is a beautifully done film from Gimel de Toro that has quite a few moments that had me in just absolute awe"
"So overall, guys, I'm gonna give the Shape of water a four and a half out of five stars"
"Guys, this movie is just and simple terms"
"To put it, it's a beautifully done romance film"
I highly recommend you guys to go check it out
