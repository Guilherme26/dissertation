once again I find myself wrestling with how I felt about a comic book film,0.15154658
a popular comic book film and if there's one thing the internet supports its gracious,0.059416313
differences of opinion so before anybody else loses their damn mind on my channel just,0.79590577
purely based on the title of the video let me just preface that thor ragnarok,0.15023741
is an earn it that's right I'm giving you my verdict on this film in,0.10841575
the first twenty seconds of this video just to calm everyone down I like the,0.17441592
movie but really just barely now if you're the kind of person that loved this,0.14994936
film unabashedly and can't stand to hear any criticism about it you should probably just,0.40320897
move on but if you're genuinely interested in hearing my thoughts on the film phase,0.0688241
three and the future of the MCU then please by all means join the conversation,0.07902014
now for those of you clicking on this video who know nothing about my channel,0.27026045
you're probably thinking to yourself this guy barely liked Thor Ragnarok must be a DC,0.35131848
fanboy right no if I could talk about DC for a second and I will,0.0954944
let's face it Man of Steel was okay Wonder Woman was good but the rest,0.29610828
of it was pretty much a hot mess but it's not about DC the fact,0.12536938
is Marvel fans in the past myself included seem to think that Marvel is infallible,0.11072388
but the problem is that neither DC nor Marvel seemingly want to admit that they,0.10017311
may have problems which will ultimately just lead to more problems DC seemingly can admit,0.15014808
that other than Wonder Woman totally their films have been a mess Suicide Squad is,0.3618339
a perfect example of how they just can't seem to find a good balance between,0.10822403
humor and the dark of grittiness they really want to go for it but Marvel,0.08598205
on the flip side needs to admit that at times their films are too light,0.0845104
too jovial to joke written and as a result none of them really feel like,0.18900874
there are any real consequences within the story and if you're the kind of person,0.10804725
who's blindly devoted to only one side of this if you say to yourself screw,0.50929296
Marvel I don't need their baby rainbow-colored or screw DC I don't need their dark,0.5876557
ideological dumpster fire I wish I were you I wish I had the kind of,0.5046171
misguided self righteousness and confidence typically only reserved for Nazis and Harvey Weinstein unnecessarily harsh,0.31089434
perhaps but it needs to be said and here's what I'm really good something I've,0.05153317
said before when DC and marvel truly compete when they are in fact equals we,0.03465341
as the audience went because they have to produce the best films available if there's,0.035213027
no real competition then they can shell out whatever they want because they know we're,0.07420366
gonna pay for it but right now Marvel seems to be getting a little overconfident,0.15297666
and that's because so far while DC is competing financially they're not necessarily competing critically,0.07769864
and you know what Marvel is showing their overconfidence because right now in my opinion,0.13060354
phase 3 is their weakest phase because so far with ant-man Doctor Strange guardians of,0.18090181
the galaxy 2 and now clora Ragnarok it's been their most comedic phase comedy in,0.10524606
a Marvel movie is obviously one of their stables and made me fall in love,0.17403378
with the MCU but is this a little too much in small doses humor can,0.10163196
add layers it can add interest it can change up the tone appropriately from the,0.047133435
very dark tone that a lot of comic book films are now going for however,0.14052969
that's in small doses and with Marvel films their jokes seem to be very obvious,0.18545908
at times even juvenile and humor is now starting to define their films in Thor,0.09701487
Ragnarok the humor is constant it's an incessant stream of characters trying to one-up one,0.08853968
another when it comes to your and you know what it's really starting to change,0.11469148
of iconic characters into something they're not this may have to do with the report,0.058546513
that much of the film was actually improvised but that actually caused a lot of,0.085858405
issues number one everyone on the team because let's face it most comic book films,0.24100271
feature a lot of characters not just one solo character but everyone on the team,0.04164136
is suddenly the same character here's what I mean by that when the Avengers got,0.07015434
together in 2012 yeah everybody told a joke or two but really there is only,0.095820904
one of them who was considered the funny one that goes to Tony Stark in,0.1163483
Phase two Marvel really followed the formula that Whedon set out in the Avengers the,0.0868903
fact that within the team there always has to be one wisecracking superhero the most,0.065321945
obvious being star-lord in guardians of the galaxy but in Phase three they amped that,0.09151325
up even more suddenly within every superhero film in every group there are three or,0.06685277
four funny ones guardians of the galaxy two is a perfect example star-lord is still,0.08604325
wisecracking but Rocket Raccoon this game even Drax the one who is the straight man,0.31089434
in the first film with a few dry jokes he's cracking wise about his own,0.08524003
feces thor ragnarok had that problem but made it exponentially worse because every character for,0.46590033
most of the time they are on screen they are trying to be funny it,0.055948716
was a huge shift in tone and character from the first two Thor films and,0.06431062
you know what it changed the characters of both Ford and Hulk even new characters,0.049762964
who could have easily balanced all the humor coming from two iconic Avengers were humorous,0.09650117
characters scourge was very silly compared to the original source material in the comic books,0.44288605
cork who's extremely serious in the very serious Planet Hulk storyline does nothing but joke,0.14912908
even hella the goddess of death loves to throw in a few quips you do,0.48564646
have to admit though Jeff Goldblum stole the show in previous Marvel films especially in,0.18142767
phase 1 & 2 there was a much better balance of humor drama and action,0.075050734
sure there were jokes in the previous films but they had other things to it,0.049273
and with these characters constantly trying to be funny it makes me not take any,0.14956002
of them seriously you see you can have the characters tell jokes without dumb themselves,0.76900494
becoming jokes this film also did the same thing with epic Marvel storylines they wasted,0.13713448
them because they didn't take them seriously Planet Hulk was one of the best laid,0.14997119
out storylines in the Marvel comics it was one of the best stories for Hulk,0.06056978
period and you know what it was relegated it was nothing better than a side,0.119670495
story much like my favorite superhero Hulk who was nothing more than a sidekick all,0.21719962
I'm saying is Marvel just don't waste greatness and if I'm to be impartial which,0.1514994
a good critic should be I have to use part of the same criticism I,0.077822015
had for Batman V Superman the Planet Hulk story got pushed aside for one very,0.062364955
obvious reason because much like Batman V Superman marvel this time tried to do too,0.08178071
much the death of Odin the introduction of three new major characters a little of,0.13186683
the Ragnarok story a little Planet Hulk and even a Doctor Strange cameo the last,0.06844582
major that I had an issue with this film is the reason that I've already,0.10876013
mentioned and you know what it's one that has given the MCU a lot of,0.070707075
criticism and that is the fact that there just doesn't seem like there are any,0.05938354
consequences within this universe DC fans have really taken notice and once again I think,0.082979664
the thor ragnarok just made it worse a lot of people not just DC fans,0.16405676
have noticed that death in the MCU for the most part means next to nothing,0.40322357
Coulson Bucky Nick Fury all died to mean something to push our characters in a,0.40273076
much more important direction and they did only for those dead people to come back,0.31613225
almost immediately if you think about some of the deaths in thor ragnarok most notably,0.11057463
the Warriors 3 what did their deaths do they didn't inspire Thor it was almost,0.11654926
as if you didn't know that they died it was a terrible tribute to three,0.12091876
characters and in two previous Thor films were like his brothers in my opinion even,0.05733051
Owens death was kind of brushed aside which was too bad because that scene in,0.23546454
particular was some of the best writing in the film probably because it wasn't comedic,0.07218371
it was a character building moment but if you think about it once again any,0.05320042
time there could have been a great character building moment the breakup with Jane Thor's,0.030498689
relationship with hella his father's death nothing happened it didn't go anywhere and what's with,0.39204493
Loki standing in the middle of New York like he didn't try to destroy the,0.1283846
city five years ago and that really sums it up for me but you know,0.10603323
what the funniest part is within thor ragnarok there's actually a scene that personifies this,0.098347805
problem Thor says to Loki in the elevator at the end of the day brother,0.13007866
you will always be you and I will always be me you see Marvel is,0.15169732
interested in these characters changing slightly you can make Thor funnier you can make the,0.077062055
whole top but without real consequences without a proper balance in tone Marvel is showing,0.084069826
us that they're not really interested in these characters growing yes this film is entertaining,0.10831914
I hear it all the time about Marvel films but you know what at this,0.12955996
point that's not enough I was a little indifferent about Doctor Strange I was a,0.057921123
little indifferent about ant-man and you know what after Thor Ragnarok I think I'm out,0.18130013
of free passes basically what I'm saying Marvel is enough joking around as always let,0.099315524
