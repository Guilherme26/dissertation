everyone is running from pair of weights and today I'm going to be reviewing Disney and Pixar Coco I'm so was directed by Lee after she was responsible for a directing Toy Story 3 and Adrianne Molina is a co-director who is responsible for writing the good dinosaur,0.10847947
so Coco centers around Miguel who is a young boy who was an aspiring musician that just so happens to be born into a shoemaking family that absolutely hates music they hate music so much even saying that music is the reason that their family was cursed many many years ago,0.5529416
so the movie basically shows Miguel kind of fighting with his family especially his Abuelita who is really really against music in the family and he tries so hard to try to expire to his music goals despite being told no time after time again that somehow he ends up in the land of the dead and in order to leave he has to receive his family's blessing,0.087252475
the only problem is he wants to receive one of his family's blessings that actually wants him to do music,0.0664564
so he seeks goes on a journey to find her next oh de la Cruz who he believes to be a long-lost relative on one of his ancestors I'm so rude then on the movie details his journey finding our nurse toenail crews and then also Miguel learning more about his family and his ancestors and how music played a role into their family in the past,0.1827328

I can see my family like I understand a lot of people had an issue with why they're releasing this film during Thanksgiving week instead of closer to the first week of November which is closer to November 1st the day is dead,0.10342527
but after watching the movie and seeing their really theme of family and being thankful for what those before,0.06372926

even though he was a young boy like he wanted to be a musician,0.16830511
he knew that that's what he was destined to do,0.07207982
and no matter who told him no he was going to do what he needed to do to follow history,0.058612093
