hello everyone and welcome back to day two of the noirvember challenge that we're doing this year,0.0776453
if you're new to this channel my name is medium and in here i aim to talk about classic movies and discover and discuss what makes them so special,0.09937066
and also the people who made them possible i'm devoting the whole month of november to hopefully talk about a film noir movie each day,0.10844594
thank you,0.039406788
so much for joining me today because we have one of my favorite film noirs of all time and beyond that one of my favorite films will stop and that is none other than double indemnity,0.15411244
so sit back relax because we're going to talk about film noir magic here and so with no more ado let's jump into it there's a quote by alfred hitchcock saying since double indemnity,0.2518532
the two most important words in motion pictures are billy and wilder and that is just a hint of the extent of the impact that double indemnity had upon its release and furthermore the movie has persistently and quite rightfully,0.07674811
so as one of the best examples of film noir,0.10681577
i'm sure wilder wasn't aware that,0.14012538
he was filming a film noir but he certainly helped shape the themes the atmosphere the archetypes the characters that made and continue to make this genre so popular and so fascinating having said that this is also a film that beyond any genre,0.06083321
it's a billy wilder movie and one of the greatest assets of this film as in most of the movies by wilder is the script is the writing for double indemnity,0.12685226
it had not only one fantastic writer but three wilder who frequently worked with a writing partner in this period was normally charles brackett who for this movie stepped out of the project found in this case in raymond chandler who was an accomplished crime fiction writer the best possible writing partner to adapt a fantastic novella by james malahan kane another prominent figure of crime fiction and quite frankly these two writers are my favorites the relationship between chandler and wilder in this movie was far from ideal,0.09140627
they clashed many times,0.0604377
but the results of the movie are outstanding you can even see for a brief moment chandler in this movie who makes a cameo,0.07557698
and it's the only time he appeared in movies and also james malhankan was very pleased very happy with the results of their adaptation of his original novella,0.060513936
and that's something that doesn't happen,0.07161894
often so kudos to chandler and wilder the original novel was based on a true crime that took place in 1927 when ruth snyder and her lover killed her husband to get double indemnity in her husband's life insurance and that he was a writer whose work was frequently brought to the screen and you'll probably be familiar with also mildred pierce,0.25287518
and the postman always rings twice two of his most famous and fantastic work,0.051475234
so as you can see we're dealing here with heavy powerhouses billy wilder in turn was predominantly known for writing and then directing comedies and with this movie he raced above all genres as not only a fantastic sharp writer but also as a great filmmaker in double indemnity he used voice overs,0.05800703
we have a quite amount executives but in any case it's remained,0.039062966
one iconic from fatale of the genre who is also marvelously dressed by eddie head and she plays a ruthless yet super charismatic lady that it's again right up there with the best examples of this very cinematic archetype so they are razor sharp dialogues full of sexual innuendo,0.53490317
and i think that especially the voice over the fred mcmurray who plays walter neff the main character of this movie has it is beyond amazing,0.0914173
and i think it's been spoofed many times when they try to recreate the genre in a comedic way and again especially fred mcmurray's character with lines like i couldn't hear my footsteps it was the walk of a dead man or how could have i known that murder sometimes smell like honeysuckles,0.282102
let me tell you that he plays here in my opinion,0.079360776
even though he has fantastic,0.09873488
co-stars like again barbara stanway or edward g robinson,0.17897409
i think that fred mcmurray in this movie is outstanding he was cast against type,0.18023299
in fact i think all of them are cast against type,0.2766419
because in mcmurray's case he was predominantly known for playing good guys in light comedy screwball comedies in the 30s and 40s too barbara stanway in turn had played dramas had had terrific performances in comedies too pre-code dramas prank copper dramas certainly very intense,0.11733202
but she had never played a role like this before and conversely edward g robinson who was known mostly for playing gangsters in the 30s he plays here quite an agreeable character in fact the chemistry he has with fred,0.1684145
in this movie is the sweetest,0.058361247
i think relationship that we see in double indemnity,0.174187
so i think that they were all again cast against type and it worked wonders,0.1422353
it's one,0.06593724
i think of the successes of this movie aside from the writing the movie released in 1944 also the year that as i said in my previous video phantom lady laura,0.15003587
were also released it helped in a way launched the genre and it became clear that audiences were very keen at that time to watch this type of stories brought to the screen one of the most captivating things about this film is the fact that crime is associated with relatively ordinary,0.05815997
people,0.06546804
so unlike 30s gangster movies where crime was attributed to criminals in this case as also happened with phantom lady crime happens to again relatively common people,0.2776372
but there is that element that is so fantastic that the genre brought and is that fatality,0.07253977
we are watching characters that are doomed from the get-go and there's that element of there's no escaping my fate,0.05695225
and it also presents characters that don't show any regret for the crimes they commit,0.103066474
it's more like an stoic acceptance of what's coming to them and that's quite fascinating,0.06776055
and in turn quite revealing of the era in which these movies were made and released i particularly love the scene in which the crime is committed,0.10653424
i think that the way it was shot in which we can only see barbara stanwick's face the way,0.35212547
she acts in that scene is amazing,0.2675947
and it is one of my favorite scenes from the movie it is also known that billy wilder filmed two endings for the movie which i'm obviously not going to reveal but i'll only say that the one that it's in the actual movie is quite characteristic of wilder's work,0.079482354
so again we have many elements that helped shape film noir,0.11304315
but this is also very much a billy wilder film so for those of you who are not that familiar with the genre but do love wilder's work,0.10564888
you cannot miss double indemnity,0.43653798
if you haven't watched it i highly highly encourage that you go today if possible and find a copy of double indemnity and watch it i promise you you won't regret this,0.14914547
so that's all for today's video for the second day of november,0.1034601

the love for classic movies for sharing the love for film noir and see you all very soon in my next video bye there's even a reference to the philadelphia story that i've always found very funny,0.15046328
and it is when barbara stanwick and fred mcmurray meet and he says that he's walter neff with two f's like philadelphia,0.2415775
if you know the story and she says what story,0.05510609
the philadelphia story,0.04572376
so i've always found that very funny,0.06664839
i don't know what was the gag here but i'm up for it i love it,0.102046855
