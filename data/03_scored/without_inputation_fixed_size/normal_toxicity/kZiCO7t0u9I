howdy so after a rough week and we're not even going to get into that,0.10051074
I decided yesterday to go with my wife to see the movie arrival at the,0.06460465
theater down in Syracuse and I want to give basically a quick review about it,0.16046357
you know it's not the movie I thought I was going to see when I,0.08264912
saw the previews and saw that it was going to be aliens and such I,0.1080391
thought wow this is going to be really cool because I love aliens so we,0.107991956
went we went to a matinee showing of it and they don't have it in,0.07720261
3d or imax and initially I wondered why and now I know why since I,0.05170925
saw the movie anyway it stars Amy Adams and jeremy renner and Forest Whitaker and,0.100146614
in essence aliens have come to visit earth and they're spread out over the earth,0.15663125
in 12 different locations not in major cities but in just 12 locations and we're,0.05626261
trying to find out why and Forest Whitaker plays a captain I believe who goes,0.08821455
in scouts Amy Adams character who happens to be a language expert to try to,0.051518794
get her to come and help them figure out how to communicate with the aliens,0.24187437
to find out why they're there and that's basically in the entire movie in essence,0.10632065
they've got the same thing going on in all the other locations so everyone is,0.054442704
trying to find you know their own way of communicating and she turns out to,0.10516578
do the best job of it she's able to figure out that they use certain,0.08616314
symbols that look like smoke to communicate and she's able to figure out what the,0.15442596
words and meanings mean she takes some risks in order to get there and of,0.10834586
course that that was kind of cool to see and it was really neat it,0.06859978
was visually a very nice movie I have to tell you that I'm not sure,0.101913035
about everything else the aliens okay I'm just going to say the aliens will remind,0.112308554
you of the hand character from The Addams Family that's the best I got but,0.058042783
still I like the movie and you know she does figure out the language and,0.08142867
she figures out the meaning and she figures out why they there and I've seen,0.13573904
some other reviews where folks are saying okay I'm confused I don't really understand everything,0.08547199
that's going on and I'm not going to tell you everything because I met those,0.107022345
you know I'm not the guy who wants to really spoil it for everybody but,0.137975
what I am going to tell you is that you have to pay attention to,0.14523971
everything that's being said in essence think about time time for us basically says you're,0.104856946
born you go through your life you age and then a certain point you expire,0.48241106
well quantum physics basically says that time is a constant there is no beginning there,0.08336046
is no end in essence time is always the same so the beginning middle and,0.06642386
end of time is all happening at the exact same time so that's a very,0.0597047
important aspect to try to figure out in this movie and once you kind of,0.115854606
understand that then the rest of the movie starts to make sense with everything that's,0.058363095
going on whereas she gained some insight she gained some insight there's something that the,0.08167103
aliens are going to do that no one wants me Oh some people might say,0.24052997
well wait how did they know to do that well because of time I think,0.053043976
and I don't want to give it away so what i am gonna say is,0.09553726
amy adams you know what that woman is a stunning woman itch i have liked,0.40333462
everything I've ever seen her in I have not seen everything she's ever done because,0.11342528
I don't usually chase actors into movies I will you know if a movie seems,0.109512046
to catch my attention then I'll go see it but she's been solid and everything,0.14476497
I've ever seen her in Jeremy Renner was a little bit different than what I,0.14893605
expected you know I'm used to him being kind of bold and kind of smug,0.44127706
and in this movie he's supposed to be a dwell he's supposed to be a,0.08618662
genius guy and he's got a little bit of smugness but he really plays a,0.09748734
much secondary character and I have to say that for once they really let a,0.07111805
woman run the movie and i love that forest whitaker's character was really interesting because,0.122135535
if it had benefit for the fact that we know what Forest Whitaker looks like,0.111337736
when you hear his voice you're like okay what's he trying to affect you know,0.14203863
what is that voice it's not like that strong Forest Whitaker voice that were used,0.12030869
to but it's still Forest Whitaker everyone in essence played their roles the way I,0.09941491
would expect that we would do that in real life especially if you have aliens,0.31089434
all around the world and you have different countries with different cultures deciding that maybe,0.06419383
they have to do something different than what someone else might say and if you're,0.092186116
not communicating information with everybody you know things will start to happen or possibly happen,0.13726154
so like I said I thought that this movie was pretty cool if you're looking,0.1207927
for a lot of action this ain't it and truthfully I will tell you if,0.08053671
this movie hadn't looked like there would be some kind of action or something I,0.107336715
might not have ever gone but I'm glad I did so this is a rival,0.12138667
and I hope it does well it's still going up against dr. Strangelove and trolls,0.53490317
trolls yet anyway still going up against those movies I liked it my wife thought,0.4440768
it was okay someone else who went with us thought it was okay and one,0.108174734
other person he didn't like it because he said he likes more action hey you,0.14979012
know what movies don't appeal to everybody but still I think this movie deserves to,0.105437905
be seen I hope you go see it I think it's worth it I'm not,0.17362611
going to say that you're going to have as good a time as i had,0.15384263
at captain america civil war but i thought the movie was pretty good there are,0.1527931
some times there where the movie kind of slows down a little bit but it's,0.17393063
interesting in the fact that you probably needed some of that to get an understanding,0.08237608
of some of what was going on and there's a lot of flashbacks in the,0.046921838
movie that if you remember what I said about time you will understand how come,0.08416616
they're there so that's all I got I hope you all go see this movie,0.24254735
I hope you enjoy the movie when you see it and I hope this doesn't,0.09056781
look as odd as it looks to me filming it while sitting on my livingroom,0.11447655
