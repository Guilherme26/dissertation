hey it's open social thoughts today we're going to be talking about patty Jenkins's Wonder Woman starring gal gadot let me just say right off the bat that Wonder Woman is not only the best DC film ever made but it's just a plain great superhero movie and this is the first-ever first-ever Wonder Woman film the film really is an origin story,0.12546207
so before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana Princess of the Amazon a trained warrior when a pilot crashes on her Island and tells her about the war that's going on outside,0.111903064
she feels like she needs to go out there and help end this war to end all wars and out there she discovers her true powers and her true destiny despite this film being a superhero movie it feels very different from any other films,0.16050947
we've seen there seems to be a lot more hope compassion and humanity in this film and maybe that's because of our leading lady Diana who comes into this world with abundance of love and hope only to realize that the world is way more harsh than she initially realizes one of the most powerful aspects of this film,0.117244795
is that it shows you the casualties of war in a brutally honest way without sugarcoating anything and really showing you the trauma behind it like Captain America Wonder Woman is very idealistic,0.30351567
she wants to save everyone,0.08480813
and although she comes off as a bit naive,0.61076236
I think her biggest lesson that she learns is that the world isn't so black and white and that everybody is fighting their own battle,0.27694502
and I think that message was one of the most unique aspects of the film because as a superhero and you want you want to save everybody and you can't,0.032679908
and I think it's that inner turmoil but also facing that reality that is very true and very real with,0.069661945
its slow-mo action,0.18402496
shots perfect comedic timing and powerful message Wonder Woman delivers on all levels,0.18178888
gal gadot is so dang,0.26105466
beautiful every shot,0.5570805
she was in I was like holy crap girl she literally woke up like the wrong thing so but who knows I loved her as Wonder Woman and I can't wait to see what she does next in this second Hill,0.6886888
she brings up like a very powerful presence,0.15946625
but also she's very vulnerable,0.18003583
and I think that combination very inspiring to see on screen because at times I feel like female characters can only be very one-dimensional and I want to see it all I want and she really brings it,0.12410378
she is this powerful Amazon warrior and at the same time she feels very conflicted and she is able to balance these two emotions very well and I think that that one that's what me that is,0.05681975
what makes her so heroic and just plain beautiful,0.21362111
I loved the character and I know I was kind of bashing on Chris Pine for being and everything film and all my god,0.114357226
and when you see somebody else but he was really great in this and he was very heroic in his own way,0.0998037
and he brought he was a very good counterpart to gal gadot's Wonder Woman they worked very well together and everything seemed not so natural,0.20507808
it wasn't forced and there are so many key moments,0.055315446
so I was like wow I would have never thought they would ever put this in a in a superhero film especially when they just casually talked to get to know each other that was one of the best things about this film,0.08487486
and another,0.03170372
one of the highlights for me was the other cast Robin Wright at anti,0.17562057
obey ng Opie Davis stoolies to loose as Ares Harry Potter character coming back in Wonder Woman and he was so powerful and then Eleanor anayia who was in all MOBA doors face as dr.,0.016438708
Poisson,0.011219355
she was magnificent,0.14741713
I wanted more of her she seemed so evil and yet like such a real person,0.60150176
and I think that that's what patty Jenkins did so well in this film,0.24132597
and they made all these villains and even good people real people not just caricatures like I'm a villain and I I really appreciated that and we these people exist somewhere out there and they're not just flat they embody so many dimensions and body so many emotions,0.31089434
and I loved I loved to not I don't know about you,0.23110679
but finally seeing a female superhero starring in their own film,0.17607373
almost seems so normal to me,0.09701168
I know it's not but it did seem normal,0.14908582
and yet I understand how big of a deal this is and knowing that it was such a proud and monumental moment to finally see this on the big screen I know that there were parts,0.06829791
I got teary-eyed especially when she enters no-man's land it's such a powerful historic symbolic moment for not just the film itself and the story behind it,0.1356238
but for everybody else that's watching it,0.050056998
it is very emotional,0.055197936
and it's one of the most iconic moments in the film that I I really just I felt so again proud despite knowing that oh my god wonder what are you doing,0.055054866
don't go out there like it's no man's land,0.14649408
and just the fact that she did was incredibly inspiring,0.16643195
I man I appreciated this film so much and sometimes it kind of went into a cheesy territory with this message of hope and love but honestly it's the kind of message,0.10243309
we really need right,0.02802213
now,0.031218953
it's that cheesiness like we need to up that cheesy factor,0.18669865
because the world is not that great at this moment,0.19597255
and it's people like her a superhero like Wonder Woman who believes in this cause so much about love and it's unlike any other superhero I've seen because a lot of the superheroes we've seen are pretty jaded and for once we see a person who is very sure of themselves despite all the that's going on around them despite the war that she's in she's she feels OK and confident to be like we can change this with love hope and all this great message,0.08119524
I'm like oh my god yes,0.07020472
we can't,0.057364833
we can't change it,0.06200259
it,0.046851434
just takes a lot of face and a lot of man power or female woman power mine,0.24005315
I say let's replace that,0.11304401
and yeah let me know what you guys thought of the silve is and I absolutely loved it,0.080410585
I can't wait to watch the sequel,0.24057083
I know it's domestically it surpassed 100 million dollars in the box office making it the most gross film for any female director which honestly i Junkins did an incredible job I also would like to see more fight scenes next time around and I just want to see bigger better,0.24193667
villains come to life,0.3608775
yeah I have so much to say but I think I said all that I can right,0.0675443
now I have been a big fan of Wonder Woman for a while and it's just such a pleasure to finally see her in the big screen anyway,0.15221076
thank you so much for tuning in and I will see you guys,0.20167017
on the flip side bye [Applause],0.07590569
