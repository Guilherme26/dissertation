that houses him falls in love with him and rescues him her employer a man,0.26882884
named Strickland investigates this disappearance until eventually discovering Eliza intends to release the amphibian man,0.09683864
into the sea over the course of the film we see various ways in which,0.033699956
social systems oppressed minorities or people with less political power ableism in the form of,0.19132459
how Eliza is treated due to her disability racism of course sexism well it's the,0.5154597
1950s so what do you think the amphibian man is not a direct allegory for,0.15143009
any particular oppressed people the way say lesser films clumsily utilize allegory instead the amphibian,0.2988174
man is more of a grander symbol for the concept of the other director Guillermo,0.09536383
del Toro explained it himself the monster is a cipher it's a symbol it's an,0.29565573
embodiment of more than anything else other Ness I needed to talk about acceptance and,0.0610167

guillermo del toro is touching on here is a sociological concept of the other the,0.15067194
idea of other nests essential to sociological analysis of how majority and minority identities are,0.06720624
constructed this is because the representation of different groups within any given society is controlled,0.10375598
by groups that have more political power than the other in the setting of the,0.070489414
film for example white people constructed the social identities of racial minorities by representing them,0.32667634
through stereotypes and superficial observations when Strickland meets Zelda the cleaning woman mentions that she,0.112839706
is an only child Strickland incented remarks that this is unusual for her people a,0.1310072
minute or so later Strickland mentions the appearance of God and says that he probably,0.069002725
looks more like Strickland than like Zelda so in everything from social matters to religion,0.18948239
Strickland is constructing the representation of another people later in the film the diner employee,0.07087187
tells the african-american couple that they are not allowed to sit down at the counter,0.64166874
uttering other people has obvious discriminatory aspects that permeate throughout social interaction and even the,0.073554926
law but there is also a psychological component to it social identities reflect the way,0.05872978
individuals and groups internalize their established social categories within their societies such as their cultural,0.10420396
identities class identities gender identities sexual identities and so forth these social categories shape our,0.35981128
ideas about who we think we are how we want to be seen by others,0.05232127
and the groups with which we belong one of the major contributing factors to ending,0.1397588
racial segregation in America was proving that this had a severe negative psychological effect on,0.3480309
children social identities are created through ongoing social interaction with other people and the resulting,0.27004483
self-reflection about who we think we are according to these interactions this is something called,0.15437368
the looking glass self social identities are produced through agreement and disagreement with other people,0.14980924
and we adjust our behavior and self-reflection based on these interactions when Strickland invades Zelda's,0.17606851
home to discover the location of the amphibian man her husband Brewster briefly objects before,0.12933297
almost immediately backing down and allowing Strickland to manhandle his wife he also gives up,0.2568021
the location of Eliza and the amphibian man this interaction is terrifying to watch and,0.10441295
as an audience we might wonder why Brewster does not defend his wife however bear,0.12683034
in mind that his previous interactions with white men and the discrimination he faces might,0.49127483
have persuaded him that this is not a fight that he could win that even,0.1187355
if he throws him out of his home he and Zelda might face consequences for,0.15129256
that his social identity is the result of his disagreements with other people and his,0.10160657
unwillingness to get involved as a result of his self reflection of who he is,0.18257642
and what he can and cannot do after the incident Zelda tells Brewster that he,0.08879965
could never understand what it is like to be her the implication that Brewster is,0.08821509
not willing to understand what it is like to be a woman socialization shapes our,0.22820276
ideas about what it means to be a man or a woman and the unequal,0.1925446
relationship between these two identities Strickland sexually harasses Eliza at work we could say that,0.29195184
he does this because he is a bad person and maybe he is but he,0.55251455
is permitted to do this because many societies establish certain privileges in men if Eliza,0.14437906
complained there is a strong chance that the accusation would be dismissed as quickly as,0.044814747
she would be dismissed from her job 20th century philosopher Simone de Beauvoir once said,0.18957187
thus Humanity is male and man defines woman not at herself but as relation to,0.31089434
him she is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference,0.07174228
to her he is the subject he is the absolute she is the other Strickland,0.13513708
says that Eliza's inability to speak sexually arouses him and when he has sex with,0.76889026
his wife he places his hand over her mouth so that she cannot speak he,0.6046305
enjoys the ability to shape the social identity of others his references to the biblical,0.24062116
Delilah is his way of expressing his feelings about female cunning and betrayal it's his,0.25902152
way of reminding Zelda a black woman of what he believes is her place the,0.4437441
shape of water takes place during the Cold War in the 1950s the American government,0.10518009
and the Soviet government do not have any specific use for the amphibian man outside,0.15270092
of a brief discussion about the likelihood of his biology helping the space race the,0.101207584
American general explicitly says that if the Soviets wanted that America wants it if the,0.070466995
Soviets wanted they can't have it because the so it's must be up to no,0.13226429
good his sole basis for reasoning is that they are Soviets the shape of water,0.120156966
shows not only a tolerance for the other but also a love unlike in say,0.07729853
Beauty and the Beast the amphibian man does not need to transform into a human,0.33391362
to receive a happy ending movies generally present us with clear heroes and villains in,0.08210852
the film Strickland is the villain he is the true monster of the shape of,0.47696832
water movies and perhaps stories in general reinforce an individualistic worldview the idea that society,0.056350105
is made up of individuals making independent choices and that your lot in life is,0.106087826
primarily a result of your own actions irrelevant to the actions of others the individualistic,0.11130455
model of the world posits that people do what they are and that injustice and,0.32513472
impression are the result of the isolated actions of a fringe group of bad people,0.3516822
like Strickland but the truth is that the social systems that individuals create become more,0.059748914
powerful than the individual as individual people we are always participating in these social systems,0.05994895
a family is a social system a workplace is a social system when we meet,0.038579628
people and either introduce ourselves or shake hands we are participating in a social system,0.05409851
when we interact with our employers we are participating in a social system and when,0.023209875
we treat people a certain way based on their social identity we are also participating,0.086727425
in a social system it is so inescapable that it has become ubiquitous and therefore,0.091222614
invisible we choose not to see it and choose only to see the individual in,0.08839954
a sense the villain of the shape of water is not Strickland rather it is,0.062939875
the institutions and systems that affect the characters the villain is racism sexism homophobia etc,0.3540501
Strickland exhibits most of these traits so he is more like the representative of these,0.1513108
systems and functions as the voice of the institution of uttering people because a film,0.13520105
is told through and visuals rather than invisible systems of oppression to the credit of,0.05986795
the shape of water Strickland's motivations are related to his being in a system in,0.053715743
this case the government's military and intelligence sectors he complains to the general in individualistic,0.15355782
terms Strickland says that he has proven himself time and time again however the system,0.07508134
does not care about that because it is bigger than the individual Strickland is portrayed,0.14871258
as the villain of course and the audience is meant to root against him but,0.08728609
when many are confronted with the facts about other investments some are quick to dismiss,0.05199145
the concept become defensive miss the point and talk about personal responsibility instead or choose,0.04342712
the path of least resistance ignoring it as someone else's problem that is how social,0.13415202
systems and individuals interact individuals are not completely powerless though they can choose to walk,0.14731447
away from the path of least resistance and actively fight a systemic oppression despite the,0.09240116
pressure from the social systems to conform the shape of water shows us an example,0.037352294
of this when Eliza turns on the television she and Joe see the 1950s civil,0.09790046
rights movement and suppression of these protests by the police Giles frustrated demands that Eliza,0.24129176
turn it off he can't stomach watching it and instead prefers watching Bojangles an african-american,0.4659591
performer not a protester Giles who is a gay man living in the 1950s must,0.5237975
be careful about his interactions with other people his flirtation with the diner employee ends,0.31407052
badly but it could have gone much worse for him if the employee had decided,0.1520362
to become violent however his sexuality is something that he can hide and therefore has,0.4967536
a small luxury of not engaging Zelda in contrast must take into account who she,0.14409675
is speaking to in every situation in her life to protect herself from sexism and,0.30310303
more violent forms of bigotry related to her race Giles tries to make this someone,0.4046306
else's problem and exemplified by Eliza's request to help the amphibian man which he also,0.0841246
rejects he eventually finds that he cannot take it anymore seeing the diner employee reject,0.11195482
him and then shoo away African Americans he realizes that hiding in the system men,0.4401287
ignoring the problem is no way to live and he helps Eliza rescue the amphibian,0.16656141
man he even fights Strickland it's easy to pretend sociological systems of oppression do not,0.13910213
exist sometimes they benefit us and we instinctively side with things that benefit us also,0.08468423
because we would prefer to think of ourselves as individuals instead of existing within complex,0.12949799
social systems that we do not entirely control and also because such systems are invisible,0.061136276
