so this is a semi Chinese movie written and directed by a Lulu Wang and,0.1803949
I say semi Chinese because there is a fair bit of English in it too,0.15921743
and story here follows this young woman living in New York whose family decides to,0.087244265
fly back to China under the pretense of a wedding and she decides to join,0.21957515
them although the real reason for them going is something else entirely it's a bit,0.10441266
of a secret they're keeping and something they feel I could do more harm than,0.28811905
good if it got out so the movie basically follows this family as they have,0.055176772
a bit of a reunion and in the middle of it all is this young,0.10601488
woman who is a bit torn on the whole idea of keeping a secret she's,0.5378705
not convinced it's for the best but she doesn't want to go against her family,0.16194963
either that's the basic premise here and to be fair I was a little bit,0.09650439
underwhelmed by it mainly because I've heard a lot of good things about this one,0.061452877
it's been very well received but I'm not that convinced by it now don't get,0.067515805
me wrong this is by no means a bad movie in fact I liked it,0.15085469
but the story here was a bit underwhelming to me it's very very simple it's,0.24064292
all about this family and the secret they're keeping and that's it there's just nothing,0.10551178
more to it and it didn't feel like it really went anywhere either like your,0.11462741
plot itself almost feels non-existent it's just all about the characters and their whole family,0.055047225
dynamic it doesn't feel like anything really happens and it doesn't really go anywhere which,0.06646877
I guess could be fine but I didn't really even get the point though the,0.029618189
main characters are and her whole storyline about her life in New York and whatnot,0.06601327
and I don't think it's really dug into the other characters very much either it,0.06950668
does give most of them a little bit of depth they all feel unique and,0.08613267
different but that's about it they didn't really go very much deeper than that and,0.05537202
yeah at the end of the day I guess I just didn't really get the,0.05265696
point of it all I mean the movie is about family and about what people,0.08906235
do to protect their loved ones or what they think is protecting them even if,0.051598486
that means lying and deceiving and how they justify that to themselves and the people,0.27147448
around them but beyond that I just don't really know what I was supposed to,0.089323536
take away from this however as I said I still didn't like it it's still,0.10788749
a perfectly enjoyable movie I thought it was pretty funny at times too it's also,0.101993315
well act then the pacing wasn't bad either although it didn't really feel like it,0.058082823
went anywhere but it didn't drag or feel long so I guess it did something,0.06111255
right it's also a very good-looking a well-directed movie I also liked how they used,0.05644881
the music in this and thought the editing worked very well they utilized a lot,0.059773725
of hard cuts which can sometimes feel a bit abrupt but in this it worked,0.06256476
oh and the grand mind is is absolutely adorable I liked her a lot so,0.06242393
yeah beyond the story stuff and a general plot which I wasn't completely sold on,0.04625412
I did end up liking just about everything else and genuinely don't have any real,0.07341958
complaints about it and you know what it did have this certain charm to it,0.07112331
as well it's a very charming movie with a lot of heart and some touching,0.11944587
moments as well and I'm guessing that's really the reason so many people have liked,0.054020133
this as much as they have it's probably also most of the reason I didn't,0.042912137
really mind it either but did I personally think it's great no but it's most,0.085339166
definitely not bad either however would I recommend it sure I mean I think most,0.059125066
people will find something to like about it so you know maybe give it a,0.060712703
