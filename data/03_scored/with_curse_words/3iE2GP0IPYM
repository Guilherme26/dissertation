so I've watched the farewell I feel about an asian-american who finds out her grandmother,0.40334365
is dying so her family all gather in China to say goodbye however the grandmother,0.15454383
doesn't even know and instead thinks that they're all coming for her grandson's wedding this,0.09816014
is Lulu Wong's first major film and it's based on her own life and relationship,0.09465303
with her grandmother the strongest aspects of this film are the performances and the writing,0.10220599
the soundtrack and visuals are also rather good consistent and quite memorable this review is,0.029184315
not going to be as structured as I'd like so I'm just going to talk,0.08396364
about it in some supose convoluted way but I should say warning that there are,0.23958637
spoilers ahead if you haven't already seen it if you're in the UK you can,0.08250507
see it on Google or YouTube right now so please do aquafina who plays the,0.11086384
lead character Billy has this utterly perfect expression all the time some actors could easily,0.09468926
do the typical actus thing where they pretend to be sad where they talk slowly,0.17023529
sigh you know laughs weakly to that thing what that it's like to me it's,0.15964358
just really obvious and it's obvious that they're acting and it distracts me but Aquafina,0.11519677
is very believable she is quite an endearing approach she doesn't try to hide her,0.19236147
sadness though her ninite doesn't even see how depressed she is just just totally he,0.27296114
current of how she feels the performance is over all are very naturalistic and I,0.14412796
thought everyone did a good job there are a lot of scenes of eating in,0.09631276
this film food is a huge part of Chinese culture and a classic dinner scene,0.1513831
is a cinema essential making these scenes particularly warming and filled with dramatic tension very,0.14888743
little is said explicitly but it's like the whole bomb under the table situation everyone,0.19433062
knows there's something wrong but no one's saying anything or doing anything for fear no,0.06029871
no finding out I like how Aquafina is trying her best to speak Mandarin in,0.081542455
the film this is an experience that I've been through many times you know she,0.052026697
tries to guess the tones of the language and she gets corrected but at least,0.06769412
she tries also the hotel scene in it it's basically their flip reverse of what,0.11600859
it feels like to look Asian in Europe you get are still are these questions,0.13391884
like do you feel more British or Chinese it's their these from my perspective it's,0.13522518
just so bizarre that people would think that I who lived in Hong Kong for,0.18062045
just one year of my life and then lived here nearly thirty years of my,0.08608098
life like don't speak Chinese I hold a British passport you'd think I would feel,0.23595205
more British than Chinese but it's nice at least they show an interest I guess,0.17702772
there's a lot of shots with negative space no doubt it's meant to create some,0.17746888
sense of sadness and loneliness and well the film is really good at delivering on,0.06638452
that it's so hard to explain just how much of a merit is to watch,0.078688845
this film for me I mean anyone that's gone through loss will feel the same,0.18427747
anyone that's ever tried to pretend to be okay so as not to upset someone,0.17626895
else will feel the same while I was looking forward to this film I I,0.0859192
didn't anticipate how much it would dredge up inside of me and consequently I found,0.1078573
myself crying hysterically while watching this film I was just I wasn't able to watch,0.28553128
it without relating it to the loss of my own grandmother to top it all,0.081499666
off when I first watched it I was with my friend he bless him he'd,0.077637225
experienced the same loss very recently so we both lost our grandma and we were,0.077185154
watching this film I just spent most of the time apologizing to him I'm sorry,0.08032515
Mike I'm sorry the writer director Lily Wong takes time to show B Lee and,0.10354636
her nice relationship it was doing these scenes I found myself tearing up the most,0.15980832
I really don't think it's possible to watch this film entirely objectively unless you've never,0.13821518
experienced loss of a grandparent I simply found myself constantly projecting it made the experience,0.07245108
both while cathartic extremely difficult the fact that this film is labeled as a comedy,0.24128844
is the real joke cause jokes in this I kind of the sort of sad,0.16625324
attempts that Outsiders make to try to cheer you up during a tragic moment in,0.06981223
your life and like you laughs weakly but it does nothing to help that being,0.29872978
said the film is successful at balancing tragedy or comedy it manages to be considerably,0.07056238
humorous despite all the characters being so sad I guess the right word for this,0.07668693
is absurdist you're laughing at the situation not how sad they are the cinematography I,0.26039955
struggled with to begin with I was struggling to understand the need for so much,0.051772397
negative space as I was saying but you know it's unique in that it's framed,0.11344934
in this way and it almost feels like a comedy in the way it's shot,0.33490768
but it makes the characters appeal pathetic because they're small and significant which is a,0.69542736
good thing it also lets us see the lovely set design there are few scenes,0.075258575
where no nice white hair is against the white background which might be a mistake,0.2536795
but over where we really enjoyed the set design it doesn't try to glamorize China,0.12395838
or make it exotic and a fantastical like some imagined it to be it actually,0.069625795
feels nostalgic in all of its imperfections the fact that it seems old-fashioned or even,0.099304155
tacky especially the wedding stuff it gives it this undeniable charm I especially love the,0.10316556
clothes that the elderly family members wear like the best and the flip-flops and just,0.18918878
the lovely patterns and obviously the flat caps and everything it feels familiar and therefore,0.058217548
nostalgic even though I know obviously a lot of viewers when an experienced it firsthand,0.05745465
it doesn't feel like an international film and Hollywood sense obviously and it isn't it's,0.06612821
an American film this film is about integrity and culture differences in a single way,0.038613286
is it wrong to lie or rather hide the fatal illness of a loved one,0.14989696
or to save them from the pain and fear of dying that is essentially the,0.11132642
question of the film is asking Billy who is American above all protests to lie,0.31089434
struggling to understand why family members could do something so immoral in her eyes but,0.25091487
it's a typical criticism that people have of China and its culture you know ignorance,0.65790206
is bliss that it is but Americans and Western culture object to the idea that,0.10878576
someone isn't fully informed of their situation but perhaps is designed in such a way,0.071116894
in order for people to live happily and free from discomfort or pain I mean,0.23771818
personally I'm on the side of the Westerners I'm West and which is why this,0.04933513
film is truly an American film because our point of view characters American with American,0.025127165
sensibility is everything Western morals we learn about Chinese traditions through her like scene at,0.12174727
the graveyard she shown the almost bizarre ways they show respect to their past loved,0.10578875
ones this scene nervous he says as a funny scene something I've always found a,0.102204144
bit boring about actual Chinese films is that they're just too serious or their comedy,0.32228115
is just too outrageous and just not funny but the farewell has the subtle but,0.17357518
respectful element of comedy it does it really well there's a poignant moment in the,0.06555731
film where Billy's uncle tells her that the main difference between East and West is,0.07033312
that Westerners Billy ones life belongs to oneself but in reality one's life forms part,0.15018316
of a whole it belongs to family and to society individualism is very Western and,0.06560214
is ultimately considered selfish when a family member dies the pain extends to the family,0.29473135
but equally Billy ashamed for being so openly sad about it that hurt sadface will,0.36133933
bring everyone else down it's as if she is expected to do what's right for,0.08061633
the family by not resigning to her own selfishness she wasn't able to attend her,0.36140126
grandfather's funeral in the past in fact it was kept a secret from her too,0.09350433
but the thing is is that she doesn't understand the difficulties it would have caused,0.15205647
her from a financial point of view nor the stress it would put on her,0.12502298
parents to tell her but as a result she wasn't able to get closure and,0.15883817
she feels that she's entitled to it as she should feel death is difficult but,0.40339142
you can't necessarily share grief you shouldn't be able to dictate how someone should feel,0.10283047
when suffering from a bereavement grief is personal though it can be shared as a,0.10100432
kid we can resent our parents for doing this or thing for the rest of,0.15002142
our life even after we've had our own kid I completely empathize with Billy despite,0.100445524
the intentions of her family that's what makes this film so thought-provoking eventually Billy becomes,0.157759
part of the family by sort of finally one last time resisting the desire to,0.07146201
tell 9i the truth but this time she's learned the significance of playing her part,0.070870936
of this family despite her moral compass pointing her in the other direction but she,0.11770875
doesn't accept this reality out of submission or fear or anger or anything like that,0.10262904
but rather out of love for her family especially for her 9 a this is,0.11146673
a moment visually signified by the slow motion tracking shot of the family walking together,0.13879906
or looking into the camera Lulu Wong says in an interview that it's meant to,0.08786784
be a dramatic representation of Billy's feelings as she finally embraces the line so it,0.10648121
was gonna say a bunch of other little bits that I liked in no particular,0.26798242
order I like how when she arrives in China after the flight she gets assaulted,0.3661553
by taxi drivers trying to get to buy a taxi or to get in their,0.061867256
taxi or whatever I mean this happened to me when I visited China so it's,0.13965085
and yet it's quite intimidating there's a great establishing shot of the apartment complex for,0.08376639
her 9i lives when Billy first arrives and it's so different from New York it's,0.13940603
also very much a communal building the flat doesn't stand out or anything it forms,0.11748856
part of a whole series of flats but you know maybe I'm just looking too,0.048258454
deep into it then they're necessary but I just feel like it has that sentiment,0.08317493
of community versus the individualism of New York also the relationship between her and her,0.10443136
mother is extremely like mine as in with my mother my Chinese mother and I'm,0.15261291
sure many people regardless of their mother's homeland can agree that they have a similarly,0.17250694
tense and passive-aggressive relationship at times though one of the many awkward dinner scenes are,0.12355072
the one where they're at the restaurant with the lazy susan they're just something so,0.26068628
uncomfortable it's great it's essentially like oh no it's just a thing in Chinese culture,0.2409641
but it's almost like every conversation with family is like a battle or competition of,0.07245811
who's more successful is America better than China you know you always competing with each,0.115707144
other you shut trying to show off just success because success is the biggest sign,0.41799504
of prosperity obviously means money and success and safety it da bobba I had to,0.08465904
I had to look up the drinking game that play play where there they're like,0.043305382
flapping their arms or whatever okay so essentially every player in the group gets a,0.12247575
number so you just name yourselves in a circle and then what you're supposed to,0.1875993
say is number bird Flyers number bird Flyers so if I say I'm one I,0.08350157
go one bird flies one bird flies one bird Flyers till three bird flies and,0.11772248
then the person who's named three has to then continue but you can do things,0.09791483
that are tricky like you could look at someone you could say you can look,0.24148887
at number five but you say six and then five stuff starts to think that,0.037205495
it's their turn and then they start going and then they have to drink basically,0.1301542
if you make a mistake or if you miss your turn then you have to,0.29614174
drink and obviously the more you drink the harder it gets so yeah it's pretty,0.2509243
funny to me also I have to play it with so my friends anyway this,0.075514115
film is absolutely lovely even though I weep like a baby whenever I watch it,0.3259659
and watched it a second time yesterday seeing the grandmother waving goodbye to them at,0.08111818
the end of the film it's unbearable I just kind of imagined my own grandma,0.10480743
and it's so hard I feel like I wanted to watch this film completely objectively,0.09188186
but you you can't you can't not think about your own experiences of these things,0.18976337
that's what film is it's what art is right it's supposed to evoke emotion but,0.07041853
it's hard yeah but overall yeah the film it's it's very approachable despite being almost,0.11547854
entirely a Mandarin and obviously despite the subject matter it isn't an art film but,0.065825135
it's almost certainly an independent film please allow yourself to experience it I'm happy to,0.077814005
hear it won the Independent Spirit Award for best film of the year - I,0.01940006
mean it's always nice to see films like that get recognition because now I feel,0.09332468
like it's helping to promote films of this kind of nature it just means there's,0.08433335
more film to me to talk about my channel and we thanks so much for,0.085919954
