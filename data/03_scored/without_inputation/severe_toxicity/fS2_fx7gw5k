film cinema the silent era I'm talking they were able to do things that you,0.026155686
could see nowhere else it wasn't a recording device it was actually creating a language,0.02825168

it's an acquired language and it's always evolving and most of it was defined pretty,0.03183702
sound before there was dialogue or sound effects the strength of the film rested entirely,0.014063313

a successful blockbuster every major movie franchise boasts a healthy amount of action and regardless,0.019711386
of genre or target audience action seems to be the one component to a film,0.032793555
that offers something for everyone across all ages and cultures but somehow even with action,0.022713361
appearing virtually everywhere Mad Max fury road managed to stand taller than any of its,0.09009513
counterparts by a mile most films start with the script but George Miller decided from,0.018104969
the very beginning that this film needed to work visually before anything else so one,0.024378981
of my notions was that if I make it as the action sequences as a,0.011937385
silent and it reads as a silent movie then it can only get better with,0.023222227
self I differently had the Hitchcock dictum in my head and definitely he said I,0.09741681
try to make movies where they don't have to read the subtitles in Japan the,0.056537285
film was conceived as one long chase sequence told through very little dialogue or exposition,0.023313357
so Miller in collaboration with Brendan McCarthy opted out of a traditional script and instead,0.029566083
"drafted storyboards for the entire film that ended up totaling over 3,500 separate images representing",0.03658643
a comprehensive shot list for every planned sequence to be filmed using what he had,0.061250776
learned on happy feet a 3d animated film that allowed for complete freedom of camera,0.0840087
movement he took that same sense of freedom into Mad Max where advancements in filmmaking,0.080438666
technology and special effects would allow him to do things he could never even imagine,0.043491036
doing back in the 1970s but just like with the original trilogy the entire design,0.02247855
behind the film is grounded in reality by establishing a clear set of storytelling rules,0.012066431
the kind of rules who would - that everything was basically found objects repurposed so,0.05909691
if you notice that the mask that max wears is made from a garden fork,0.053095624
the the vehicles had to be vehicles which didn't have the most modern technology with,0.009551372
micro processes and crunch technology and so on so everything had to work for that,0.04827903
lot logic found objects are repurposed and their that also applied to costume and language,0.042302355
and the other thing we said is we said that just because it's the wasteland,0.047147553
it doesn't mean people can't make beautiful things so all of that sort of unified,0.07228484
the film - something we were quite rigorous about those sort of things everything came,0.02062934
about out of story and that would lead to the stunt the guys on the,0.032301318
poles you know it's like pirates having to board a well-defended maury you can't approach,0.06453745
it from the ground but if they can approach it from above even in what's,0.017417833
essentially a non-stop action film storytelling comes before anything else every moment of action comes,0.038928542
from the choices of its characters in extreme circumstances those trying to survive or those,0.019023588
trying to die historic on the fury road its mythology is so effectively established its,0.05645347
imagery so immediately evocative that we instantly understand what these characters are after and why,0.03301373
everyone in this story is one way or another a commodity Max is a blood,0.1558299

brand on them so that you didn't have to get too much exposition you knew,0.050136887
that people were just running away with this foundation of storytelling in place they designed,0.13821718
every piece of clothing every weapon and every vehicle to fit within the wasteland in,0.124749206
the world of Mad Max cars have essentially become religious artifacts and as such every,0.086259685
component of every vehicle is designed to fit the specific character from the hundreds of,0.012151575
unique steering wheels to the intricate detailing of the warlords million Thrones every single vehicle,0.012575962
was fully customized and fully functional because Miller never intended to make a green-screen movie,0.013019639
he wanted everything to be done practically if it could and that meant creating over,0.02542465
a hundred unique vehicles that could drive at full speed at across the desert with,0.018156853
everything rooted in logic and physics even when the action feels larger-than-life it never feels,0.039294392
impossible everything that we're seeing could theoretically happen within the fictional universe that Miller created,0.027408227
and I think that believability is crucial to its success but its believability is earned,0.011045374
over 80% of the stunts and effects seen on screen were practical in-camera effects including,0.011834947
the doof wagon complete with fully functional flame-throwing guitar or the blood bag sequence and,0.17526725
even the infamous polecat scene was done the on location in camera with stunt performers,0.10943335
being filmed while swinging on a giant pendulum on a moving vehicle nearly everything you,0.041944485
see in the finished film was done for real every chase every every explosion and,0.0833821
it's impossible not to feel the sheer visceral energy pumping throughout as a result but,0.029404443
while the film uses practical effects whenever possible and is better for it it's a,0.011517655
film that could not and would not exist without an extensive use of CGI and,0.057739936
Miller uses it in subtle ways throughout most of the film usually to erase stunts,0.037922785
rigging or tire tracks for multiple takes films in the same location there is some,0.02624748
digital face replacing to better hide stun doubles and most frequently it's used to composite,0.054654147
different shots together when it would be too dangerous to do it any other way,0.121435925
principle was let's do it old school and then augment it should we need to,0.022229107
with with with digitally I'm kind of averse to hundred percent CG shots if if,0.13754135
it can be avoided I always love to have some practical live-action element in there,0.034551635
to ground the shot even if you end up virtually replacing everything it still inherits,0.28094396
something from the original live-action that that is a valuable thing all in all I,0.08735192
think fury road is one of the great examples to study for understanding when and,0.021781439
how to use CGI versus when to use practical effects it's a tool like anything,0.034965377
else and when used properly can elevate a film beyond what would ever be possible,0.017143779
with practical effects alone but I think fury road makes the ultimate case for why,0.025116669
filmmakers should resist using too much CGI when it could be done practically instead because,0.03162815
CGI is great for certain things like removing something from a shot like wires or,0.23563784
dolly track or for seamlessly combining shots together but I doubt CGI could ever pull,0.06100266
off a shot like this as convincingly as Miller did with practical effects all films,0.12103881
are asking us to suspend our disbelief and to go on a journey but there's,0.019210504
a limit to what feels possible and all too often when overusing CGI or just,0.0394873
using it in the wrong ways it starts to feel less like human beings in,0.24375992
life-threatening situations and more like action figures being thrown around with no real consequence there's,0.062470723
a limit to what CG can believably accomplish and what human beings can believably do,0.118813105
even the superheroes and when the scope of action and movies continually gets stretched further,0.022090748
and further past the point of believability it loses all sense of tension and granted,0.031213742
these can still be fun movies to watch but they lack the same visceral gut,0.10739723
punch that I believe all great action movies should have with the acclaim rightfully directed,0.2907376
at films like Mad Max fury road Mission Impossible fall out or Dunkirk it seems,0.068850495
that most people feel the same way there's a yearning for larger-than-life action spectacle that,0.032482248
gives us a reason to see something on the big screen and both critics and,0.025523096
audiences alike seem to appreciate the films that strike the right balance between practical and,0.02167368
digital effects and I hope with the success of these films that more filmmakers will,0.047784798
take on that challenge because there's no doubt that it's harder fury road required seven,0.051508497
months of shooting in the Namibian desert with so much dust that they had to,0.24840365
use leaf blowers and special fit pipes to keep it all from obscuring the lens,0.058466982
working in harsh conditions doing incredibly dangerous stunts where there was constant risk of equipment,0.033652306
being destroyed or worse severe injury to the stunt teams directing a film of this,0.082016475
magnitude is like going to war I was talking - Peter where is a wonderful,0.10130082
Australian director and I just did ask it's so difficult it was it was like,0.026061894
walking a really big dog I wanted to go that way the dog dragged me,0.103748694
this way and he said with George all movies like that he said you've got,0.031252988
to go into a movie as if you are patrol in the jungle with the,0.1356948
platoon you don't know where the snipers are you don't know where the landmines are,0.09568001
and they're gonna come but you've got to complete the job you try to bring,0.05085063
it all together into that camera and capture it all it all the ingredients together,0.07876639
at that moment but there's a certain flexibility afloat you have to have and be,0.018752193
alert to those things but I think that hardship that elements of danger is felt,0.03524276
in the finished film and it pays off Mad Max fury road is action filmmaking,0.054508474
at its absolute finest and it raises the bar for what blockbuster cinema can be,0.018570596
