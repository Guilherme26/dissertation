i know i've been doing a lot of horror,0.29794163
and i still have a huge list of movies that have been requested or just movies that i really want to watch on my channel that i'm going to be getting to,0.07591598
but this one i really wanted to do as soon as i could i don't know much about this movie at all i believe it is about the day of the dead,0.2801137
and it's about the main characters kind of like ancestry and culture and kind of learning about that i know this movie has such high praises,0.08964002
so many people have said what an amazing movie this is anyways,0.07217968
that's really all,0.05146871
i have to say about this i'm so excited to watch so let's get into it,0.1720273
oh i love this intro already i can already tell this is going to be such a beautifully designed and animated movie the papa,0.113979794
he was a musician he and his family would sing and dance,0.095690474
and one day he left with his guitar and never returned,0.16299821
they always gotta hit us with a sad story in the beginning she didn't have time to cry over that walkway musician oh okay after banishing all music from her life she found a way to provide for her daughter,0.17110799
oh you're a twig nico have some more no gracias i asked if you would like more thumbnails i feel like grandmothers in a lot of different cultures just love giving the grandchildren as much food as possible oh that's rough music is amazing,0.35690156
oh my gosh is this dog gonna be a main character wow,0.31089434
i love that dog nesto de la cruz took his first steps towards becoming the most beloved singer in mexico is this going to be his great great grandfather that tore his family apart until 1942 when he was crushed by come on what did the la cruz always say seizure moment,0.2740606
oh that's like his little mentor,0.16879296
yeah,0.040847696
i don't blame him for being terrified to tell them that he likes music if that's how they react to this it's just poor dante,0.16779871
follow you forever,0.054986913
now go get my shoe,0.29957345
i love the humor in this so far all this work to bring the family together look how beautiful that is coming home no mama it's okay,0.1855579
oh,0.046070345
this is really cool because i don't know a lot about the day of the dead and what the traditions are,0.1526305
so i think that this is really cool,0.045062415
that disney did a movie representing a different culture and different traditions this music is so beautiful i'm gonna play mariachi plaza if it kills me nothing we've all decided it's time joined us in the workshop i'm sure he'll be thrilled to do that carrying on the family's tradition,0.31089434
i also don't trust that dog underneath there i feel like he's gonna mess something up,0.2526833
oh my god i knew it,0.070057124
he was so close,0.12275672
i knew it i'm gonna be a musician,0.09301136
what is all this you keep secrets from your own family,0.3544595
it's all that i mean yeah you guys react very poorly to anything regarding music you said my family would guide me well de la cruz is my family,0.19206917
he's got a point,0.078469336
oh god is she gonna break his guitar or something,0.3992286
i don't care,0.21943821
if i'm on some stupid ofrenda wow,0.80892247
that's beautiful,0.07263099
oh god he's gonna try and steal his guitar your great great grandson i need to borrow this,0.402849
oh no i'm gonna play the plaza just like you did that is pretty terrifying,0.19493274
i oh is this his family,0.08335694
yeah see i love that i hope he adopts the dog at the end and he becomes part of the family,0.18724926
i'm pretty sure i saw something like that shot in the trailer and i thought it was,0.3592277
so cool looking look at all of that oh your photos are in your son have a great listen,0.11015625
yes what about the worker,0.09696256
they don't get to see their family,0.10094293
okay when i say that was pretty bad just now that that was a lie and i apologize for doing that no photo that's really sad,0.22608434
i don't know what i do if no one put up my photo,0.08717841
i know that sounds,0.061504014
so depressing you starve from the dead but i wasn't stealing the guitar it was my great great grandfather's,0.5391607
yeah don't say that in front of her you know she's the reason why the whole family hates music i give you my blessing to go home to put my photo back on the ofrenda and to never play music again what she can't do that here we go mariachi plus here i come two seconds and you already break your promise i've just had a really hard dialogue and i could really use an amigo right,0.18101148
now oh i'll be your friend oh you like de la cruz he and i go way back i can get your front proceeds to his sunrise spectacular show this is de la cruz no one's ever put up my picture,0.18932097
but you can change that this is okay,0.14942516
so he's not de la cruz well this is great because he needed a friend,0.23947614
so now he has one one hiccup the la cruz is a tough guy to get to and i need to cross that bridge soon like,0.27902156
yeah he definitely doesn't know de la cruz right,0.17273425
he's just lying about that hey you said you have real tickets that that was a lie,0.38097048
i apologize for that at least he's honest and feels remorse or maybe he only feels remorse when he gets caught that's probably it actually and they go to drink from the milk of their mother who is a cactus but also me and her milk is not him,0.11915592
this is quite an elaborate piece,0.07501718
ernesto doesn't do rehearsals,0.15459125
he's too busy hosting the fancy party at the top of his tower,0.24131683
i know where we have to go,0.060863703
i don't want to see your stupid face actor come on my favorite character promise we'll bring it right back like the time you promised to bring back my van or my mini fridge,0.8188981
oh just,0.031717155
yeah,0.040847696
he has a bad track record you okay i'm fading it,0.24180111
i can feel it,0.051741008
oh cause,0.07232227
no one remembers him why am i getting emotional,0.124929845
oh yeah i'm with the dog on this one when there's no one left in the living world who remembers you you disappear from this world oh that is so heartbreaking that was actually a question i had in the beginning where it's like obviously families are honoring those in their family that they love that have passed on but eventually if people stop having children in your family everyone's gonna forget about you at some point,0.17705674
if generations don't pass on these stories and these people that's really sad is ernesto de la cruz going to be really rude or not appreciative of miguel,0.18912594
i don't know i'm just stressed about he idolizes him so much when he actually meets him,0.18602002
i feel like people are always so disappointed when they meet their idols okay even the dog is disappointed i'm nervous for him,0.23234323
you got this,0.09987365
let's go hector's great don't go crazy,0.4512482
he's a natural i love their friendship,0.1300279
oh my gosh this is one of the most wholesome and pure friendships,0.14655668
i think i've seen in a movie in a very long,0.11748959
time,0.050087117
why do you have to ruin everything run away from his family,0.33377975
they just want to send him back to the line of the living room,0.15142635
you said that was your only family the only person who could send you home,0.11610813
i do have another family,0.058292832
i could have taken,0.08529503
my photo back this whole time,0.045351546
okay this friendship crumbled a lot faster than i thought it would keep your dumb photos stay away from me,0.7445393
now music's,0.0543663
the only thing that makes me happy,0.14284535
it's very selfish of the family to be like you can't like music because one person that was mean to us and screwed us over was a musician,0.5289504
if my family was like this oh my gosh i would be the same way as miguel,0.18436788
i wanted to put down roots he wanted to play for the world,0.31089434
what's more selfish than leaving your family to go do pursue music do pursue to go pursue music is to then ban every single other person in your family from liking listening to playing music all right,0.4902394
the moment of truth is coming,0.0390771
i'm so nervous for him,0.08416989
this is like jay gatsby's parties,0.15086675
this is a lot he really had it,0.07147621
there are you all right nino,0.07907118
my boy with a talent like yours how could i not listen okay,0.47759825
he seems nice,0.07884272
i have a great great grandson good okay i was really nervous,0.04457897
he was going to be mean or i don't know i am sorry to see you go home again,0.13145685
i hope you die,0.94992846
oh he's going to try and give him the blessing,0.20469344
and it's not going to work,0.09240165
i give you my blessing you said you take back my photo you promised miguel,0.11339326
he told me,0.06367723
he knew you hector,0.1996554
please began you're being forgotten and whose fault is that hector,0.35590535
please those were my songs,0.1261956
you took my songs that made you famous being forgotten is because you never told anyone that i wrote them that's crazy,0.60652757
they let go,0.059215352
no,0.06626663
we made a great team,0.058639992
but you died and i knew something was gonna go wrong,0.63284194
he couldn't be perfect,0.18444705
i would move heaven and earth,0.052833065
but in the movie this is not good hate me,0.20462348
if you want but my mind is made up,0.09072261
so people are calling him chorizo,0.09476164
even though that's not the reason he died or something,0.24122791
i oh my gosh all right,0.15814282
i um i did not see any of this coming security you took everything away from me poor hector,0.23952167
i would hate to have you think that you murdered hector for his songs,0.64010143
you don't think that everyone knows the good guy,0.15290052
yeah we know security take care of miguel he'll be extending his stay whatever family success doesn't come for free,0.07634784
yeah you have to be willing to do whatever,0.10556903
it takes to seize your mom,0.56200653
but you're dead i trusted him right hector to the rescue right hector and dante,0.5215192
they told me not to be like,0.09319536
but i didn't listen,0.070426874
well you didn't know that he was actual trash,0.7208837
oh no i just wanted to see her again i never should have left,0.14977866
santa cecilia hector deserves the best but he loved her so much like wait a minute,0.24022016

that's my mama coco,0.23958209
that's my mommy melda is that you oh this is so much better is that on me oh my gosh what an amazing plot twist,0.37674078

and i hope they continue to represent other cultures and traditions and people from all over the world the visual aspect was breathtaking it was beautiful,0.06321745
