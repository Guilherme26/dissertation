you know I had a dream that one day someone would actually make a film about Martin Luther King jr. and handle it in a very truthful accurate and respectful manner and it looks like that dream has come true hey guys the black corner guy today,0.3287486
I'm here to review the film Selma now the film Selma takes place in a very tumultuous time in US history where segregation was alive and well in the south and it follows the demonstrations and peaceful protests by Martin Luther King jr. and how he got it all together none of my knowledge,0.08745276
and I could be wrong about this,0.09384174
but I don't think there has ever been a theatrical film made about Martin,0.08493589
Luther King jr. sure there's been a lot of TV movies TV specials documentaries and miniseries about the man but never a full-on theatrical film about Martin Luther King and it could be because with all of his contributions to the world,0.11594273
and countless of good things,0.08716961
he has done to sum it all up in a two-hour long movie I just wouldn't do the man any justice,0.15280207
so I guess nobody wanted to attack that but seeing Selma I think they really picked a very monumental time in Maher Luther King's life to show on the big screen and what I really appreciate about this film is that it does it takes place after all the things that we really remember Maher Luther King 4 it takes place after his speech at Washington DC,0.15311538
it takes place after he won his Nobel Peace Prize,0.084772795
it takes place after all the major events that we've come to know about Martin Luther King and it's like the events afterwards this takes place,0.07453571
I believe in 1965 in Selma Alabama and I really praised the movie for doing that they easily could have been like this is the life of Martin,0.06539727
Luther King we're gonna go through all of it,0.12451706
and we're gonna end on like the big speech though they actually address one key moment in Maher Luther King's life basically they pulled a Lincoln with this movie we're focused on one major event in the man's life and really showed it to us,0.16757624
and in my honest and humble opinion,0.07969708
I believe that this was the perfect time for a film like Selma to be released especially after all the events that have occurred in the last few years because people need to be reminded of the struggle of the trials and tribulations that the people face back in the 1950s and 60s they need to be reminded of the people that sacrifice their lives to give us the rights that we have today and people need to be inspired to make a change and needless to say I thought that someone was a great and fantastic film and one that I truly respect in the fact that it doesn't really follow,0.08088773
the same trend as other films that talk about the civil rights movement before it I mean yes they do shine a light on the civil rights movement and they do show it as a justification to it,0.079683624
and I found that so intriguing,0.053390194
I was hoping that this film could stand out amongst the other civil rights type films,0.13239105
and I think that it truly does and it stands out for many reasons the biggest one being,0.07549233
its portrayal of the man that was Martin,0.08279173
Luther King jr. they do not put,0.4033234
this guy on a pedestal they do not treat him as a God among men as I've seen in TV specials and heard in documentaries,0.33541843
they show dr.,0.05249333
King for what he truly was he was a man he had faults,0.32955292
he had a lot of faults that were addressed in the film he had doubts,0.10512917
there was a scene where he's in the jail cell,0.17774668
he's talking to one of the people that I can guessing is his friend,0.073023774
and he's talking about you know is what we're doing really going to help is it really going to change you know we could get a man to sit down in a dining table but he can't pay for the burger at the diner,0.13386442
he had hesitations,0.15397884
this was same where he's standing on the bridge,0.19995731
he's wondering whether I should push forward or if he should just turn back he was a man,0.5154597
and I loved how the film humanized dr.,0.13500643
King they in put him on a pedestal that is the most perfect representation of King I've seen in a movie thus far and that is all attributed to the excellent performance done by this guy,0.11107386
I cannot pronounce his last name and I would hate to butcher it so I'll put his name right here but I'm gonna call him,0.35105044
David,0.03323103
oh this guy he did such a phenomenal job portraying,0.21009377
dr.,0.049754996
Martin Luther King now at first scared because his voice didn't really capture the voice that was Martin Luther King Jr's voice I've heard Martin Luther King's voice so many times I could tell it from a mile away,0.13318403
but when I heard his voice didn't really sound like him and I was a little scared and hesitant to really see him as Martin Luther King but as the film continued I just got sucked into his performance especially when he is preaching to the crowd I felt the presence of Martin Luther King right there I could feel it radiating out of him,0.26330397
I hope he gets nominated I don't know if he'll win but if he gets nominated I'm gonna be so happy,0.17065203
because his performance is truly Oscar worthy,0.1014022
one of the best performances I've seen of the year though riding in the film was excellent,0.043369092
and I loved how they addressed,0.074259914
all the struggles all the pressure and all the conflict that dr.,0.06082065
King had to face during the Selma protest you would think that a film called Selma would only focus on the town of Selma,0.093291864
and what Martin Luther King jr. did in that town,0.090487085
but no the film also addresses what he was dealing with meeting with the president in Washington DC and trying to push the Voting Rights Act,0.061569717
it shows his marital struggle to keep his marriage alive because there's a lot of issues going on right,0.24156068
there,0.016601479
I love that the film addressed this because I've heard about for years but I always thought no one would ever see that port in film and they did they addressed,0.048769705
it in this film to actually put it on screen and gave it so much attention and focus,0.079471946
I love that now although I felt like the film's representation of the march and the brutality by the police was done very well and unfiltered,0.27538198
I felt like they kind of withheld on showing a little bit more of the gruesomeness of that scene I felt like it was probably more gruesome and more damaging than what we actually saw but for the scene that were there,0.24004391
they were brutal and they were really hard to watch it was just gut-wrenching to think that people would actually do like this and it did happen and the sad part is it continues to happen,0.14948747
I was like the fact that they gave dr.,0.05185304
King a sense of humor,0.07240342
I mean there are some scenes where he's talking to his buddies,0.10645823
and it just feels like a natural conversation,0.08360705
and they're just joking around,0.083153866
I wish the more scenes like that,0.07480829
but of course it's all about the events that are going down,0.055037905
the struggles that he's facing but it would have been nice to see more downtime,0.15069777
that dr.,0.058644332
King had with his friends,0.055915926
I mean those scenes were really well done,0.1333406
it really captures the normal life that dr.,0.073436975
King sort of lived now and again I guess the last thing I want to talk about and praise about this film was the acting,0.09389039
I already praised David OHS performance of dr. King but everybody else also did a really good job,0.07321919
and there's just so many notable performances like I thought Tom Wilkinson did a really good job at portraying lyndon b johnson i felt like he captured him perfectly overall guys i love this film this film really touched me it really spoke to me,0.1495588
this is probably one of the best films about the civil rights movement,0.082482755
i probably have ever seen it if i had seen it in 2014,0.08890383
it definitely would have been in my top ten of the year and it would have been number one,0.05001856
that's how great it was all the performances were solid,0.07654948
they were genuine everything about this film I just felt like clicked and I could not take my eyes off the screen I was in trans by the story at the events that were occurring on screen and the performances that each and every actor and actress in this film gave it is an amazing and phenomenal film and I really hope that you guys go and check it out because it is getting the highest grade it could ever get on this channel,0.11808209
that's the 5 out of 5 but it's not an epic masterpiece,0.07773235
it's just a masterpiece,0.06647088
it's an excellent work of film,0.07789408
and I just loved it,0.050224267
and in recommending films that are very similar to summer you guys should definitely check out Malcolm X starring Denzel Washington as the militant leader,0.06133716
he does a really good job at conveying and capturing the man that was Malcolm X in fact he earned an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal,0.066865936
that's how good it was I would also recommend that you check out Lincoln which also has a very similar set up and then it takes place in a very crucial moment in this very important person's,0.050553516
life,0.06118394
but anyway I would truly love to know what you guys thought about this film,0.14946587
if you have seen it did you love it as much as I did did you feel like it was a mask Peace in an excellent film or did it just not live up to what you were hoping and he felt like it was emotionally manipulative and totally bias,0.16626775
and let me know who is your favorite social activists somebody that fights injustice in the world comment,0.092652775
