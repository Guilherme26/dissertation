avengers end game is written and directed by the russo brothers and stars so many,0.0970721
people this is the culmination of a ton of different story lines all coalescing into,0.08314651
a gigantic finale so after the devastating events of infinity war where thanos wiped out,0.1646995
half of all life in the universe the remaining avengers are scrambling to hopefully find,0.15415958
a way to set things right in the universe once again before i get any,0.065396845
farther in the review i do want to give a big thank you to dollar,0.15754332
shave club they are the sponsor for this video and i am proud to have,0.07751988
them as a sponsor and to be a club partner with them so thank you,0.10240032
very much to them stay tuned to after the review to learn a little bit,0.15585531
more about them i'm always weary of films like avengers end game for multiple reasons,0.18323138
one they're very difficult to talk about in a spoiler free review which is what,0.061982192
this is and don't worry i'll ruin nothing of course i won't even hint at,0.20012012
things as many professional outlets already have but the other thing is that these films,0.1529909
come with so much hype to the point where i have basically learned to turn,0.11214701
my brain off from that hype i don't listen to theories i don't listen to,0.23190059
ideas that other people might have i tend to not even read what the plot,0.31089434
is and i don't watch too much trailers or clips or anything i just try,0.10685359
to stay away because hype can ruin a movie and so whenever a film like,0.1513602
this comes around i try to be as disconnected from it as possible and that's,0.08203574
my way of honoring the filmmakers and the writers and hoping that you know i'm,0.058507636
experiencing a film with them that they wanted me to see rather than hoping it,0.09535035
goes in a billion different directions that i have already cooked up in my brain,0.3153971
even though they were never planning to do that in the first place and i'm,0.10749035
happy to say this was a highly satisfying film that brought tons of story lines,0.072727636
to a fantastic conclusion and despite being three hours long really didn't feel like it,0.058093954
it felt about as long as infinity war did it's a beefy run time obviously,0.24173228
and there will be many people who have things to say about that and complain,0.09768356
about that and focus on the runtime but there were just so many things they,0.04406147
had to find a way to present and honor in this film and i can,0.057719693
understand that two and a half hours just probably wasn't enough because they wrote themselves,0.09350098
in a corner at the end of infinity war because you're in this place where,0.24147451
you're like how are they going to get out of this and with serialized entertainment,0.19485423
you're going to have to continue this story and they need an entire first act,0.16012299
to really deal with that and sometimes that first act can feel a little slow,0.12916432
purposefully and when i say slow i don't necessarily mean that it's a bad thing,0.09419364
it's a very somber first act you're you feel like there's desperation this is not,0.13191852
a feeling you normally get in a superhero film usually there's lots of punching and,0.20402862
it's really entertaining and there's plenty of that in this movie but this film takes,0.107150994
a long time to make you feel like you're watching regular people not just superheroes,0.15451452
the avengers in this movie feel the most human they ever have after the ending,0.12587042
of infinity war when you realized how much of them could be expendable when it,0.21591464
came to the mcu's decisions picking up here really does make them feel like normal,0.077462435
people which is extremely refreshing they're not doing superhero stuff the whole movie they feel,0.13128306
like they're they're really desperate like they're scrambling for for really anything that they can,0.13244486
get their hands on and so in that way there's an urgency in almost every,0.11808602
scene which is a writer's dream when when you feel like your characters are in,0.060688432
a place where they are always constantly in motion towards some goal and it feels,0.061556607
like they have no hope the whole time that's really exciting the second act picks,0.07669406
up considerably in the action department with a structure that i actually predicted i never,0.07045208
once publicly predicted it so it's not a spoiler for me to say that but,0.073575094
i just in my head i was like i think they might do this and,0.15189366
they did but it wasn't like i was like oh i guess that i was,0.06781099
happy because i wanted them to do that and i wanted to see what that,0.073821746
could bring about and i was really pleased with what they do and that's all,0.064478196
i'll say but you came to this movie for the third act and it delivers,0.09659668
it's just an hour of insanity it's nlgger awesome and the final action set piece,0.33267814
is honestly movie magic it's everything you expect to see when you pay money for,0.07799058
a ticket for a film of this size and it's awe-inspiring really what they do,0.08330522
here and you have to give it to the visual effects designers especially because they,0.086180255
are just doing incredible work but in regards to that third act there's something that,0.043111872
gets tossed around a lot in reviews and it's usually looked down upon and that's,0.1277809
fan service a lot of critics like to pinpoint fanservice and say that's bad and,0.15559456
i've probably even done that before but really as a creator why would you not,0.06220001
want to serve your fans they're the ones who are supporting you and paying for,0.10652479
you and making sure that you can continue to work so naturally you'd want to,0.17462
make them feel happy and show them things they want to see but that's not,0.088505045
to say this film doesn't take risks they definitely do with some characters and you'd,0.08630677
have to be a big fan of this series to know that they're taking risks,0.08680048
there's things that just i did not expect and it's through the whole movie and,0.04898963
you're like okay that's what they did and for some people they might hate it,0.31089434
and and some might think it's extremely awesome i don't know i thought it was,0.08593344
funny i liked it i'm excited to talk about it in a spoiler video and,0.13944098
uh more more on that later but let's talk negatives because no movie's perfect no,0.099949926
matter how much you want it to be uh except for alien and 12 angry,0.2847396
men yeah yeah those movies are pretty much perfect this film is not paced as,0.1870173
well as infinity war is and a lot of it is because of that first,0.1127922
act it is slow you could call it a slow burn which is probably the,0.11122075
most you know nice way to say that you were kind of bored for a,0.24264887
while and some people will probably say that but they needed it to set up,0.051803317
certain things there are still a few scenes though that do feel like they could,0.057231266
have been cut there are a few specific scenes that don't really necessarily have to,0.055394664
be in the movie but they're there sort of for information sake and that's understandable,0.10290174
again but still there's just a little bit in that first half hour to 40,0.08507024
minutes where you're like yeah that doesn't necessarily have to be there so it's not,0.08472921
paced as well as infinity war infinity war is a movie that from beginning to,0.10082326
end it really feels extremely cohesive i like that film a lot more than when,0.08909384
i first reviewed it even then i really liked it but i've really come to,0.06598429
love that movie and i would say just as a pure superhero film infinity war,0.16839212
is probably the better movie but endgame is more emotionally satisfying and resonant like i,0.18303259
did tear up an endgame and i did cry and i felt something it definitely,0.12171487
hit me and that's not normal so in some ways you can look at them,0.604741
in very different ways they're nice companion pieces with each other and i like that,0.14946502
i like that this isn't just a copy and paste infinity war it feels like,0.10160357
they did try to do a few things differently yes you're going to get your,0.10440325
massive superhero battles i mean what do you want to do just nlgger flip a,0.3729097
coin and say oh heads i win okay end credits no you want to see,0.1598247
him nlgger punch people in the face of course jesus but within that finale there's,0.7291043
so much going on that it does feel like the russos were a little overwhelmed,0.077290386
because there are things happening in the finale and i know they're happening but we,0.04669852
don't really see them because there's so much that they're like we're just going to,0.07304091
focus on this part right now but but i'm like what about that stuff no,0.07122997
we're not showing you that because this is happening oh okay i get it yeah,0.15485567
it does sort of feel like they had things they wanted to happen they got,0.08391304
that shot and said okay we got that shot now forget about that because there's,0.29609674
nlgger happening over here that's cooler so it doesn't feel quite as coherent as the,0.3555823
massive finale that took place in wakanda in infinity war although it's still like glorious,0.24143198
to look at and you can absolutely nitpick the nlgger out of this movie i,0.3614016
mean you can go and watch it and be like no that is so dumb,0.79950136
no and just be that person but like i'm not that person okay you know,0.17138593
i go to these films to have fun i go to these films to enjoy,0.20641066
myself and i did and a story i'm going to give avengers end game an,0.111054525
a minus when it comes to things i wanted to see i saw most of,0.078574374
them when it comes to things that i didn't think i was going to see,0.075612746
most of them i was excited about seeing so i saw stuff and it was,0.1129396
good that's my extremely in-depth review of avengers i can't speak i still have a,0.062475022
remnant of a cold i really do think most fans are going to enjoy this,0.12981263
film i'm not seeing it being an overly divisive movie at all i think there,0.14983426
might be a few risks they take where fans might be divided on it but,0.056444097
those are like small moments i was just talking to a friend of mine about,0.10851185
this when a film is overall really good but there's little things you didn't like,0.082035124
you can overlook it you're like well i love most this movie but that one,0.1486157
part but you know what everything else was so good so it's okay i'll accept,0.06021384
it whereas if this film was just littered with problems i'd want to talk about,0.17812157
all those but when you have so much good happening around a couple little things,0.102468885
you can really start to nitpick and get like annoyingly nitpicky about and at that,0.14956553
point you have to ask yourself is this worth it you know life is short,0.18659568
go see the movie but like i said in the beginning of the video thank,0.076362684
