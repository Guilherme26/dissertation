hurt once you have a giant truck with speakers on it and a dude playing guitar with a mask on his face,0.53188324

there's not a lot of dialogue in this,0.06875477
and yet you can still follow the story the actions and the emotions of people really speak for themselves get a little prologue a little voiceover I'd m√°ximos a compliment or breath other than that you just figure stuff out just from the way people are and that's cool even with it being based on a franchise especially one from 30 years ago it's a self-contained story,0.08476257
yeah you can make a sequel out of it and trust me,0.17855373

I'm just saying Charlie's throne as furiosa is freaking a in this film she fights,0.5154597
she's badass she's so great,0.43662056
now I know there's been some criticism that people are like is this a Mad Max film cuz I'm pretty much seen like there's one part of the movie where he's not heavily involved for a reason,0.22209206
but once he is is there the entire time it's just that he has a really good person beside him,0.07986257
but as far as the setup of the movie it's the same as the Mad Max movies particularly last two,0.15405995
Mad,0.24880621
Max movies,0.058421414

I take back everything I said about dark and moon,0.07319032
no no no I'm sorry yeah you you redeemed yourself but I'm not taking anything back the character I kind of identify with the most is Nicholas Hoult he plays nuts,0.44592142
it means nothing more to him than to have a mortal Joe recognize him,0.14554308
and one day take him to the gates of Valhalla,0.17161085
there's a particular scene that I felt bad for this dude even with him being on the bad side,0.23098023
you just want to do this,0.101332225
one thing right you finally get the opportunity to do it,0.07729886
he does something wrong,0.10782217
and you just are like oh man oh man that was so much fun non-stop can't say enough good things about this movie but it's a black bear review,0.3028019
so you know if I got to give you the good and I got to give you the back,0.073018424
ok 3d you gotta stop,0.32659373
I'm sorry this was my limit,0.065892674
I'm cool with IMAX,0.10227088
I'm cool with big screen,0.10805569
but the 3d gimmick has got to go this movie is going so good I've enjoying myself and then there's just one little mask or one little guy running across or one little guitar just something that just just shooting directly at the screen and I don't watch it in 3d but I knew oh this is for the 3d screen stop doing that it just takes you out of a movie when things do that make a 3d gimmicky complete film or just make a film in a 3d environment,0.31089434
I'm so sick of seeing scenes in movies where I know they are deliberately there just so they can have that 3d effect,0.15193236
so they can say hey let's make people pay $3 more for 3d,0.10781778
if you don't need it,0.108914614
don't do it,0.08765486
it doesn't know if it's a sequel or a reboot,0.109555185
and I think it would have helped to decide they explained generically who max is in the beginning you're gonna be able to follow it even if you know nothing about the Mad Max franchise,0.14986649
it's a whole new story,0.045609966
but yes there aren't time that's kind of referencing something that happened,0.04915994
in earlier Mad,0.15013784
Max films but you don't really get too much detail to it the biggest part of that are these flashbacks there's time when Max has these just weird flashbacks where something happened in the past,0.08549869
you can leave it to interpretation,0.09875638
if you've seen some of those earlier films you might have a better understanding of what that's trying to reference,0.10851596
so I think if they would have just decided it was a sequel decided was a reboot,0.113752365
and just gave some kind of context to some of those things that would just made it absolutely perfect for the nerdy immortal Joe the main bad guy in this film is played by the same actor who played toecutter,0.3732247
the main bad guy in the very first Mad Max bill from over 30 years ago that is an amazing thing,0.28987315
and obviously the director George Miller has been with Mad Max since the beginning but did you know that George Miller was also the director of babe pig in the city and the Happy Feet movies now the next time they do a Mad Max film I just want your pig on a motorcycle like a talking pig Mohawk,0.6836911
and then in the back is just a penguin dancing,0.19437271
okay,0.050967902
I have to dress criticism on the internet of what is this movie trying to convey is it trying to teach us something to preach something to blow it's a movie enjoy the movie for what it is it's fun,0.10901045
are there,0.014705673
some themed attic elements,0.122050025
you can platter alike sure what movie doesn't have that um soul plane,0.1894016
it is just a movie to enjoy,0.08453669
and I enjoyed it man,0.113830276
I can't recommend this movie enough Mad Max cannot be beat,0.38717395
well except by female acapella group gangs can't stop them cars can't stop them guns can't stop them acapella singing 90s hip-hop jams too much,0.3835246
for max,0.048150055
let me know what you thought of Mad,0.27443665
Max fury road,0.05059773
I love you like a blade doesn't about a 5000,0.16201648
