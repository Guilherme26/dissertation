"anyways,, i'm hoping- grandma, grandpa, you know what i'm talking about-don't you? anyways,, ""modern times"" was charlie chaplin's last film as the little tramp, who in this movie is living in the great depression, he's struggling alongside this orphan girl that he recently met (paulette goddard) because of two reasons: one being the tramps usual bad luck, and two being how work industries were changing, possibly for the worst at that time; businesses were replacing manual labor with machinery for the sake of saving a profit, and the machinery that did require manual labour had so many advances that it became tough for labourers to handle the machinery in the first place, which of course leads to some of the best physical comedy in this movie! i was really excited to check out ""modern times"" because i've actually never seen a full-length silent movie, i've only seen clips from buster keaton and charlie chaplin movies in video essays as examples of really good sight gags, and i agreed with all of that-i thought they were funny, but i never really had the urge to check them out, plus streaming services have few to none in regards to silent movies, because there really isn't that big of a demand other than huge, hardcore film aficionados",0.1539292,0.0266719190654505,0.2413841725499348,0.052,False
"but since i'm covering classical movies and i've always wanted to check out more silent movies anyways, and with all the free time that i had, i gave ""modern times"" a view on netflix, and it was my first and thankfully not last silent movie i'll ever see, because ""modern times"" was such a huge surprise in so many ways-the biggest surprise, of course being with the with the physical comedy- with the slapstick! you hear it all the time that charlie chaplin was a comedic genius in the silent era, and i was hesitant to think that way because i'm not really a big fan of labeling directors as 'geniuses' or 'hacks' but having seen this movie, charlie chaplin really was a comedic genius because of how great he was at selling a laugh without any words whatsoever! it didn't matter if the gags were forced or obvious or so predictable that you could see them coming a mile away, what really matters, and what was chaplin's greatest skill was his comedic timing and delivery because he and the other actors have these exaggerated facial expressions that tell you everything you need to know about these people without any dialogue whatsoever, but never to a point where it felt cartoony or unrealistic,, if anything, the stunts in this movie seen as plausible as you could possibly get",0.09870692,0.2227088417161192,0.1937685979345352,0.034,False

"because that's something that slapstick comedies often don't really understand: these sight gags, the reactions-especially matters so much to the characters, and in many cases the reactions matter more than the pratfalls because the tramp has 2 recurring reactions that really sum him up as a character; one is this dumbfounded look of confusion that happens for two reasons-one of which is when he's in the wrong place in the wrong time and he's in",0.22987647,0.9970495642331076,0.2284263959390862,0.135,False

"and if we have, we feel guilty about it, we want to make amends, and that's what really makes him such a realistic and likeable character, it makes it a lot easier to laugh for him and at the people that he's causing trouble and mischief to, and it also makes us feel a little sad whenever the slapstick happens to him, because we've latched on to him as a character so much! but one of (for me) the best qualities about this movie and something that i think gets overlooked about silent movies 'cause i don't hear people talk about this that much, the music! chaplin was one of the few directors who actually did the musical score for his own films",0.1539292,6.172571998984014e-05,0.2369659475465313,0.063,False
