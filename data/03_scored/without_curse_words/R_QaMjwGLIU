to talk spoilers about Mission Impossible fallout is to talk about Henry freakin cavil alright,0.43361965
last chance this is the spoiler review you've been warned and they do a really,0.10856397
good job teasing it out okay are you still here he's the villain oh and,0.27055827
he's such a good villain he is like I've debated about whether or not I,0.28521657
wanted to go here but I will he's like Alan Rickman good as a villain,0.24303359
uh and I think he like this isn't a role as good as Hans Gruber,0.16909245
but I think if someone gave Henry Cavill such a role he could nail it,0.07330209
he he is just so good why is he so good because from what I've,0.0758531
heard Henry Cavill it's not a nice guy so question for McQuarrie finally put him,0.15169692
in his element and he shines I mean think about it right what was the,0.07419091
best moment in Justice League evil Superman because that to Henry Cavill is and again,0.27960452
the great thing about Mission Impossible followed is how they they let the Henry Cavill,0.09710654
villain storyline unfold so in the trailers they let it be known to us that,0.15128927
he was an enemy of Ethan Hunt but they made it seem like it was,0.11787127
just the CIA versus the IMF you know like you know enter interagency political espionage,0.12817127
drama right but then in the actual film like halfway through the movie they clearly,0.094722115
telegraphed that Henry Cavill is indeed the villain in his exchange with Angela Bassett the,0.15294959
whole audience was kind of like you're are you telling us this like wow and,0.079686105
I think that it's a credit to Christopher McQuarrie that he didn't have to follow,0.0533336
the rule of three Hitchcock's rule of three is that you have to tell an,0.08389887
audience something three times for them to get it you know it can be verbally,0.1509672
visually but you have to put it in front of them three times but here,0.08593378
in one conversation and I guess it's also a crate to Henry Cavill he does,0.085929535
speak very clearly with his American accent right but he was like Oh Angela Bassett,0.094371304
you suspected it was an American agent working as a double agent I think it's,0.17856859
hunt and then he hands her the phone that we've only seen once before in,0.1282418
the bathroom and he gets her off of lark at the lark decoy and that,0.18508592
phone was in the bathroom and then when he hands it to Angela Bassett it's,0.09430489
a pristine phone and you're like oh my god it's him he's the villain but,0.19739224
it's so subtle I wonder if everyone gets it but I was amazed at how,0.074504025
crystal-clear it was to me and it turned out to be crystal clear to Angela,0.07302221
Bassett too because of course they were able to do an ambush on him with,0.18284266
that great underground you know gotcha scene we'll talk about that but that was really,0.099890135
cool and then basically for the rest of the movie Henry Cavill plays mission impossible,0.08415452
gasps stalk he should have been Gaston I don't know if he can sing but,0.3517452
Luke Evans played at being evil or a character that just had a very bad,0.16662894
temper and would go out of control the evil calmness of Henry Cavill it's just,0.24181889
a wonder to behold I mean and I think you might be a little bit,0.2799205
like that in real life no no I think I'm reek aval is just very,0.24175537
artistically naive although those do sometimes lead to someone being evil those characteristics my favorite,0.2836921
moment of his in the movie I liked almost all of his moments in the,0.09264031
movie but the real standout to me like if I were putting together a clip,0.18641318
reel of Awesomeness like for movies in general I would include where he his head,0.27817538
looking down at crews holding onto the bottom of the elevator and like through the,0.087838404
gate it's like one of those wire elevators so they can totally see each other,0.11612096
and just Henry Cavill so perfectly Telegraph's like you're so stupid Ethan Hunt I just,0.9156528
can't believe you're continuing with this year so I so it would be so easy,0.106313035
for me to kill you of course he has a reason not to but it,0.8355208
was a really fabulous moment I loved it so much and I know a lot,0.052462254
of you want this to lead to a Man of Steel too but unless it's,0.08248405
injustice the injustice storyline with an evil super man turned bad which would be amazing,0.27555957
and Henry Cavill would do such a good job with it but I I don't,0.10201733
honestly I just don't see that happening especially with where Warner Brothers is now I,0.07395562
don't know and also the contract problems I mean maybe I just saw based on,0.07462414
what I'm seeing here and how good Henry Cavill is I don't really think that,0.14819449
he can play a good guy to be honest with you and unfortunately Chris Evans,0.18131635
is Captain America has taken that space so I would love to explore evil Superman,0.31089434
but I don't think Warner Brothers is gonna do that so Henry Cavill every cab,0.10630697
is gonna look out for him Cavill so this is manager Danny Garcia the rocks,0.10713835
ex-wife and business partner and they should be going after roles or he plays a,0.054291125
villain going forward and he I think his star I think his star would grow,0.24052446
because that's clearly what he is meant to do like if if Alan Rickman was,0.06336832
gonna be in a role or maybe you know Patrick Wilson often plays the villain,0.18911242
he's doing so well in Aquaman those type of roles that's what Henry Cavill should,0.10519631
be doing because it would be excellent but he sure as heck ain't gonna make,0.29162288
any more Mission Impossible movies cuz they killed that dude Tom Cruise is like fine,0.7006687
it's fine if you want to have him taller than me throughout the entire film,0.1309768
but there's no way he's gonna make it out of this movie alive like the,0.15701939
whole audience again was in shock because it's like he was such a great villain,0.18447778
do you really just kill him and you left Solomon Lane alive Solomon light is,0.794439
played out I would much prefer to see Henry Cavill and Tom Cruise continue to,0.05349816
go after each other it's like to two different sides of the same coin I,0.092137024
think that would be great but you know the look on Tom Cruise's face when,0.15658453
he killed Henry Cavill he's like these are my movies it was just it was,0.6601241
really funny because of their cuz of the ball and I think maybe that being,0.1510394
taken out of the movie consistently and thinking about the behind the scenes stuff is,0.08869708
why maybe people aren't totally getting into it because I'm disappointed know what this is,0.15084545
it projected to open at and around like mid 50 mid 50s we'll talk about,0.05355389
the story aspect too I have another theory but first I want to rank the,0.051085632
action sequences so by far and away the best one is actually the bathroom fight,0.09277402
I didn't I said Paris car chase was my favorite of Tom Cruise's stunts but,0.050052665
this was like a typical action sequence except it wasn't it was the perfect action,0.07897729
sequence we've seen a lot of bathroom fights in action movies right but this one,0.07950638
just had everything and an action suspense humor they kept levelling up and laying yang,0.08142353
by the way as that lark deep decoy did a great job going toe to,0.12482866
toe with both Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill simultaneously they were like who is this,0.061850637
guy and the audience was like who is this guy and then the look on,0.11302029
leaing Yang's face was like I'm Leung yang damn it was just fantastic it was,0.6364068
edited it was also edited extremely well but my favorite moment was and I loved,0.057691403
Rebecca Ferguson showed up right that was so cool but my favorite moment was all,0.032561
the blood on the floor and they kept almost slipping on it that just was,0.15496568
a really nice touch I loved it and I like that realistic angle of spy,0.15675628
work it's messy yeah well I also want Henry Cavill is like forget extraction we're,0.09799638
gonna need a we're gonna need cleanup or something that was great I love that,0.083139665
then the Paris car chase which actually the more I thought about it I realized,0.033469524
it was multi-leveled you know like it started out with the acquiring Solomon Lane then,0.06184283
it turned into a truck chase then it was a motorcycle chase and then it,0.07422847
was Tom Cruise in a car and I liked that stuff with the French policewoman,0.10689018
how that played out although Tom Cruise is on I mean of course he's the,0.07804644
hero but you know it's a real life I mean I think he should get,0.1283745
a lot a lot of credit for how I mean I think the way you,0.08918976
played it was very good and he's lucky that that French policewoman wasn't like you,0.35705417
know some particularly women unfortunately will be like but it's still legal what you're doing,0.4906987
sir she was like he saved my life I'm just gonna let this play out,0.151545
right I mean she should have just walked away I don't know why you did,0.13718008
that doesn't carry a badge I mean I guess someone else though in the group,0.06355158
could have had a badge he was undercover but maybe someone else could have had,0.07067863
a badge I think they could have planned for that eventuality you know you'd think,0.17295647
maybe that might come up but anyway that they're all in a car and Rebecca,0.13904898
Ferguson is chasing them on a motorcycle it was great I loved Rebecca Ferguson was,0.15275462
on the motorcycle and the wind was going through the columns I thought that was,0.032391068
so cool like though like you know just she was going so fast I thought,0.114474244
that was so cool and then when Tom Cruise went down the stairs on this,0.11450408
on with the car down the steps like the way he turned around that was,0.09004139
great I mean the whole thing was not only very well staged I mean they,0.14297745
just kept this chase going I'm especially when he took the knife out he managed,0.3095376
to you were like he's gonna hide in the shrubbery of course we're gonna find,0.18448812
him but there was a way down to the canals underneath that was great so,0.08605585
cool so I like that but then also they showed off Paris beautifully from the,0.095839255
Arc de Triomphe to the small streets where it's hard to drive and sure enough,0.15548176
their truck gets jammed I couldn't tell if that was intentional or not but I,0.067144096
loved it they kept oh it must have been because their motorcycles were waiting for,0.057840813
them but I loved that they kept going they really without even skipping a beat,0.12154203
they're like ok kick out the windshield keep going I loved it that next the,0.43164355
helicopter oh by the way I wanted to say that when the convoy was going,0.071145415
and they had the diversion of that truck / to divert them down the way,0.1147216
the direction they wanted them to go in I couldn't believe it the con the,0.06322733
convoy wasn't like this seems really obvious as a way to divert us there's no,0.10307604
way I'm taking the obvious route I was stopped or I would have backed up,0.08446028
or I don't know why I would not have gone down the route that I,0.076077536
so clearly should go down cuz it's a trap alright so next up the helicopter,0.18737875
chase like the Paris car chase the real thrill here is seeing Cruz in the,0.09438198
middle of all these shots like doing it himself that that's really cool also on,0.35555613
a side note I loved when he was running across that bridge to chase after,0.08254799
cavil like when I guess I'll put the footrace in here - I thought the,0.15176332
footrace was really really well done I also cuz you're like oh yeah you don't,0.27632502
want to run against Tom Cruise he's Tom Cruise running is what he does so,0.09181702
that was so cool and I like the way they were running all the way,0.102795206
through through London in this case and they were they ran into a funeral and,0.3321586
then he was going through buildings and everything and I liked what they had this,0.108397745
gorgeous shot of him running across a bridge it was just like just in the,0.35613927
middle of like the London landscape with them a pedestrian bridge in the background it,0.17122468
was really really well done then the helicopter chase so here it was it was,0.042361416
great to see Oh so Henry Cavill riding in and then flailing around his own,0.15444347
helicopter I also like the gag when Tom Cruise climbed in and there was another,0.07252868
guy dressed like Henry Cavill also caught over the moustache and Tom Cruise is like,0.17640838
his character is like what the hell it's funny that I keep calling him Tom,0.5876557
Cruise instead of Ethan Hunt and I think that's very much you know the movies,0.06922912
the movie made that choice and now they have to live with it but I,0.0693531
thought that was hilarious and also it was not only here also excellently choreographed and,0.08188149
a fight with very high stakes starts out in the air goes through the ground,0.085241124
they're still throwing punches that was great but I like the way they had it,0.27212438
with them son him having to get the trigger off of the the countdown device,0.4039401
Tom Cruise and then his team simultaneously defusing not one but two nukes at the,0.10610047
same time in two different groups so you have ving rhames and michele monic and,0.15404624
having a really nice quiet diffusion scenario with like you know almost like it's like,0.14593661
a surgeon like a like surgery and that was great cuz of course she's a,0.23544349
doctor and they had some really nice I had a really nice exchange with each,0.056845255
other really good heart between those two but then you also have Rebecca Ferguson and,0.055290394
Simon Pegg with the other nuke with Solomon Lane and they have a cool suspenseful,0.20046714
action sequence going there and I love the Rebecca Ferguson had the same simon pegg,0.06393566
although he wasn't a damsel in distress either he's just not as well trained in,0.13238333
fighting as she is and that was they very much seen like team members and,0.088861056
I really really liked that it was just all of it made for a wonderfully,0.07037208
nuanced third act really really well constructed and then last the halo jump I mean,0.08484869
the suits were cool and Christopher McQuarrie at the press screening told us that they,0.018605713
were designed specifically for this so that you could see everyone's face that all the,0.15736999
tech that everyone wears and the in the halo jump scene had to be designed,0.15076794
specifically for this movie for the needs that they had but otherwise I just thought,0.066408865
I was a little boring like it was cool I went through a lightning storm,0.26104894
and the Henry Cavill got hit by lightning that was a fun I was a,0.099921815
neat moment but I think that it could have been more visually interesting in that,0.05317955
regard and I just I thought it was a little boring like when I was,0.23573631
watching and I was like didn't think I told us how hard it was to,0.060983542
film it and they had only three minutes to get the shot each day because,0.2694351
they wanted to film it dusk or whatever and I don't really I think this,0.102643125
scene wasn't worth the effort to be honest with you and also Ethan Hunt it,0.17168593
was frustrating actually to see him trying so hard to save someone who not only,0.11734653
clearly wouldn't save him but you know you kind of were like it's either felon,0.42113417
you know it's not good you know it was just crazy like he was I,0.53861845
mean Ethan Hunt is a really cool stand-up guy now on that note at the,0.08184466
end of the movie Ethan Hunt seemed tired well duh right but what I mean,0.11528121
is is that he nominally was physically tired but he seemed emotionally tired of this,0.16478062
spy game of no-one trusting him having to do everything by himself often being by,0.18268353
himself you know I think not you know he has a lot of teammates and,0.19560465
you know friends you know work friends but I think he's often isolated in terms,0.07274534
of his belief and that will work out right unlike so who has to do,0.10225661
it Ethan Hunt has to do it and I think since they chose to play,0.07146108
it this way with him being so exhausted and they had Henry kill cavil kill,0.59563583
Alec Baldwin maybe it's time for Ethan Hunt to lead the IMF I mean I,0.13632691
don't think Cruz would ever be willing to do it but maybe I'll have no,0.17934115
choice and he could still be in the field and lead and I would love,0.061216354
to see some other characters like Rebecca Ferguson take up some of the action sequences,0.05681967
but I think that after he broke his ankle doing a stunt and the insurance,0.089302175
company it seems had to pony up seventy million dollars in coverage I don't know,0.06165964
if they'll ever let crews do a stunt his own stunts again so this might,0.15404415
be the only direction they can go in and I think it would actually be,0.08242394
beneficial to the series I'm not saying Tom Cruise shouldn't still be the star of,0.099198766
Mission Impossible I think he should be but I think he can I think he,0.08872297
could stand to nice to think he shouldn't killed Henry Cavill off and I think,0.5154597
he could stand to share a little bit more space and I think it would,0.21666701
only improve him and I think he's got a look at the box office numbers,0.079748675
we'll see what they actually end up being but that chill alarm him and showed,0.06441319
him showing him that you know maybe he is doing something a little bit wrong,0.23979631
because this movie deserves better box office numbers quite frankly and as for the actual,0.08236102
story the movie starts out a little bit like like an old-school video game with,0.19357751
the mission presented almost directly to the audience which was both fun and a bit,0.024402807
corny also the wolf blitzer gag was super corny although to the movies credit I,0.2737823
only figured out that's what they were doing just like a few seconds before it,0.12516779
even that I thought Wolf Blitzer was just working with the IMF I was like,0.09289657
woo they flew Wolf Blitzer out there I totally didn't I forgot that they were,0.1850036
using how like Halloween masks and speaking of Halloween masks I loved Henry Cavill disdain,0.1380764
for them he's like you guys are so stupid with your Halloween masks and they,0.9326907
brilliantly brilliantly use that to trick him and when he and I love the moment,0.10792968
when he says it he's like you're stupid Halloween masks he brings it up again,0.8785311
and then as he says it he's like holy crap is that really Solomon Lane,0.7912801
no it's Benjy in a Halloween mask and you damn kids you know scooby-doo like,0.894208
it was just a great moment and come to think of it I think the,0.026216744
lame wolf blitzer moment earlier does a great job of setting this up right like,0.24277787
it seems lame until suddenly it's very very cool so I know that was great,0.52173847
oh so the opening credits by the way ruined West Bentley being in the film,0.13391101
I was watching the opening credits and I was like West Bentley who's he gonna,0.15032953
be for a while I thought maybe he'd be like one of the members like,0.06128229
one of the Apostles or something but I really liked him showing up as Michelle,0.24048358
Monica's husband you could feel the warmth of their relationship and the lives that they,0.06560098
had and I think that was both of them Michelle Michelle monoghan and West belly,0.172744
they both did a great job I mean the nice guy Ness was just rating,0.11011274
off of what's Bentley like you wouldn't believe or maybe you wouldn't believe it but,0.1519993
he just seemed like wow I think anybody would be like that awesome like no,0.24140683
matter what he did you'd be like he's so cool and in this case he,0.15716904
took the life that Ethan Hunt turned down and I really could feel that in,0.12371455
that scene I loved that you know the road not traveled and you can feel,0.10075874
how much it hurt Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and maybe you know as you can,0.09670273
see I'm referring to him and Ethan Hunt in this scenario and maybe if these,0.108953305
movies were more story based these Mission Impossible movies the road not taken' would have,0.070089415
been an interesting idea to explore further perhaps throughout the entire film but maybe in,0.049085423
the next movie right as I said I think Christopher McQuarrie has done all that,0.045635637
he can here and they should bring in somebody else and hopefully that person recognizes,0.08524407
that these movies maybe aren't as successful because audiences don't emotionally connect with the character,0.085974105
of Ethan Hunt instead they spend the movie being in awe of Tom Cruise and,0.080492824
hey the guy's awfully impressive he deserves our our awe right I mean and this,0.241036
might be the ultimate Tom Cruise movie but I'd like to add that Tom Cruise,0.061848782
is very funny very charming very handsome and a very good actor he's more than,0.117117055
just stunts and I think it would serve him well to remember that I mean,0.15191013
he's made a lot of movies don't involve any stunts but he seems to have,0.10761104
drifted away from that maybe you might want to consider circling back and bringing that,0.10650857
element into these movies all right so that's my review my spoiler review of Mission,0.090040706
Impossible fallout I'm very excited to discuss the movie with you down below both with,0.45530513
you but you thought of it and what you would do to improve it even,0.11444388
if you think it's a perfect movie but you can't argue with the lackluster box,0.4687063
office especially if it does open as expected so I think that's a good exercise,0.08254266
from a business perspective to look at these movies from the perspective and the needs,0.051776573
of the studio and also Tom Cruise right I mean he's got to know he's,0.0597956
got to keep growing this thing if he wants it to stick around for even,0.15082464
longer than it has which in itself is impressive so again share those thoughts down,0.11118641
