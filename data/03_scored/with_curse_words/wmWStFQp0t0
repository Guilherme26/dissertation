hello and welcome to the flick advisory today we're going to review Logan now Logan,0.075585455
is directed by james mangold Logan is said to be the final portrayal of the,0.07354797
character Wolverine by Hugh Jackman this is the ninth time he's played the character I'm,0.057558533
starting with 2000s x-men action was really the first time at least 20 Century Fox,0.18402407
kind of took the comic book movie seriously x-men kind of redefine the comic book,0.1327473
genre they're the first ones who really put a lot into the comic book movies,0.11938771
I've seen they could actually be more than just silly comic book movies if you,0.62794083
go back to that first x-men that I protection actually touched a lot about the,0.27536675
political and social issues I'm all being under the veil of mutants versus people but,0.15794234
the whole movie is really a civil rights movie you know if you think about,0.084781796
civil rights communes so starring hugh jackman Patrick Stewart returns as Professor X Xavier and,0.11586955
introducing Daphne keen as Laura I'm also knows x-23 hey why not okay x-23 is,0.08528912
a clone of Wolverine that they got wrong 22 times then they decided to try,0.15377863
to make it a female you know playing around the chromosomes and filing the 23rd,0.20804499
attempt to make a Wolverine clone it works oh I can't much like you know,0.10383395
one of the things you want to take note is that this movie is loosely,0.13470876
based off of the the comic book old man Logan it's loosely based because there,0.18722399
are elements that the movie can't take away from the soy and then the elements,0.08566807
of the movie doesn't take away from that particular story that story has the all,0.036729064
the Marvel now all of a model but that story has Marvel elements and Marvel,0.083786525
properties that 20 accessory box cannot use such as the whole Hawkeye those things belong,0.065641634
to Marvel Studios you know in their original series and stuff like that and so,0.11383747
20th Century Fox took the old man Logan feel and adapted it into a story,0.14646348
that they could actually use with their properties I'm so you know there is no,0.06747886
Wolverine finding the hoax you know children those things don't happen in this sir there's,0.19068061
no blind Hawkeye driving wolverine around so in that sense is there an immediate adaptation,0.15453134
of old man Logan it's more of a rethinking or loosely based off of that,0.14976375
so here you have Logan he's an old man he's an old man you know,0.46297598
imagine you know Charles Xavier now a really old man this matter of fact he's,0.15431158
kind of going see now he's got dementia or Alzheimer's he has a degenerative you,0.63221306
know the kind of brain disease here and Logan is taking care of him they,0.6162719
have so like a father-son relationship almost all the other x-men are gone they kind,0.30988577
of a little to a reason about why that's happening we'll get into that later,0.08225216
so it's really just Xavier and Logan full of full majority the movie until lower,0.12374313
comes along Laura needs help getting to this other place with these other kind of,0.10610936
upcoming mutants are like a safe haven for them anytime you are come on come,0.19023609
on everyone has come along now a lot of the things in this move we,0.06098068
work really really well as talk about those things the direction in this movie the,0.07697168
tone they decide to take this is a this be first rated our x-men movie,0.111551166
are you can say Deadpool if you want through Dipple is a raid on comic,0.3467553
book movie and he is kind of an excellent Your Honor me but this is,0.23966083
actually something that we've been waiting for for a long time it was nice to,0.052856456
see Wolverine on the screen back in two thousand it was just it was just,0.07334801
a neat thing and it has been cool ever since but you kind of wanted,0.16932938
a little bit more you kind of want of the edginess of that particular character,0.22030154
to really come through and they tried it a little bit before with 2013 the,0.11309284
Wolverine with james mangold also directed it tries to bring you a more ground in,0.12803183
a more serious a more mature wolverine character and after the release of Deadpool which,0.031832933
was rated r 20 Century Fox decided they could take a chance and tell a,0.06958692
more mature adult Wolverine story and so here they had to take that and run,0.09244012
with it at a rated r level and for that the movie doesn't hold back,0.055088423
and let me give you everything you something we've been waiting to see you know,0.14436679
for the last what 17 years you know when Wolverine you know stab somebody you're,0.53490317
selected that somebody with this cause you know finally actual blood comes out hey you,0.24072778
know it's not that clean clip they clean cut album you know what would you,0.19117467
slice it you cut all right of the wound at the exact same time we,0.34174806
got to a point where I was almost like insulting our intelligence so we finally,0.322467
get the blood on this and another thing this movie just hurts there's movie physically,0.27376306
and emotionally hurts they bring you along with these characters you know you've already known,0.10116684
you know Wolverine Logan you already know professor extra now you get to really spend,0.08632033
a lot of time with them because it's mostly them before the other x-men movie,0.13835672
here you're sharing screen time with real storm Jean Grey rogue you know Cyclops do,0.17976037
you know all these other characters finally we get to sit down with really the,0.14560176
characters we've enjoyed the most and to spend time with them and fill for them,0.059036255
and let them take you along the ride if some when bad things happen to,0.14340967
them and there's allows bad things that haven't told in this movie when bad things,0.082949474
happen to him you'd get there and it hurts you it is sort of an,0.19373037
emotionally draining movie almost like I said with my princess review as even as a,0.16197732
movie you're just high you need somebody to help you out of the seat because,0.16163881
you're exhausted and it's a good thing I mean it's effective storytelling it's good acting,0.109608196
it's a good direction I was good writing Hugh Jackman against us as well he's,0.14680871
got to know this role by the bathroom you know like the back of his,0.18112153
hand by at this point you know plane is character nine different times but he,0.052193347
actually brings it to a whole nother level this time because Wolverines out of place,0.15284924
in his life that he hasn't been before there's no more glitz and glamour there's,0.13712165
no more team even though he wasn't the biggest team players there's no real team,0.08245119
to fall back on none of that is just hear my professor actually trying to,0.082255036
take care of them and Professor X you know Charles Xavier and you know Patrick,0.10712998
Stewart playing him again gives another outstanding performance um he's an old man even-even older,0.31089434
man he's beginning to go see now so but you know somebody who hazards of,0.11845745
you know uh who's going through this you understand what a bad day is for,0.33523098
them you know they don't remember you were you trying to tell them hey you,0.1009952
know this happened back in the day they're like I'll remember that but no when,0.043713897
Charles Xavier has a bad day you know with the mind that he has when,0.24165149
that mine such a deteriorate it's not just a bad day for him that's a,0.15207928
bad day for everybody in like a five-mile radius when I try to think about,0.12004684
things that don't work in this movie I really I nothing really comes across you,0.18449159
would think maybe the thing you know the child actor Daphne King you'll think maybe,0.18010966
you know sushi or the one below and the movie she works really well she,0.16710322
gives things across a lot of times without dialogue you do believe her as this,0.13883682
savage now know now you know somebody confronts her you're kind of expecting they might,0.5154597
have something for her but nah nah you know when she goes off she goes,0.08971687
off and then Wolverine almost almost have to catch up to her you know because,0.09407198
you know it's his movie too so no she absolutely does a great job as,0.13511205
well I really had a tough time thinking anything bad about this movie in any,0.14500006
kind of points to dr. down and really the only thing i have i have,0.18559018
two things i kind of wish they had they wish they had expounded upon one,0.3030698
and movies Wolverine sick you know he's not healing i wish they kind of told,0.38814232
you hate this is what's wrong with them this is like not healing this is,0.24097899
returning them but they take the mature they make they take the more mature well,0.0806813
you know you know it gives full out of Schilling and they kind of allude,0.11133768
to it and they say hey take that for what it is and run with,0.04660733
it and also what happens to the rest of the accident you know in the,0.1465839
movie it's Caliban Wolverine and Professor X and there's no other mutants really the speaker,0.14689426
and you wonder what will happen to the other mutants weapon to the x-men once,0.3368014
again they allude to it they tell you how you know just this is probably,0.06332874
what happened here but we're not saying it definite when I'm saying in indefinite terms,0.052037057
I again at the moment shear out I understanding your audience is talking about all,0.07685618
the time you know like things you know spoon-fed to you I kind of wished,0.4427707
they have spoon fed me this one but I can live with it it's the,0.1552301
more mature around it's good storytelling I get it because this movie is essentially 17,0.071196966
years of the making I have to give it a night out of 10 this,0.08854694
is something we've been waiting for for a long long time they finally delivered it,0.02711311
to us in a near perfect package it's like when we first seen the spider-man,0.1443393
in in civil wars like this is what we've been waiting for and so that's,0.15560043
why spider-man stole that show we learn that whole movie this Logan is what we've,0.46704888
been waiting with you know excellent fan comic book fans have been waiting for for,0.08873549
a long time and they gave it to us and uh nicely wrapped bowl so,0.062021457
what do you think of Logan do you think maybe it was too sad you,0.08567608
think those two series for a comic book movie do you believe that this has,0.06216932
to do with Deadpool success let me know in the comments please hit the like,0.08422381
button subscribe and more reviews coming to you I took a quick break because I,0.13799912
have some dental work so I didn't really feel comfortable talking on the camera while,0.057757646
it was hurting I want to get into it away so Logan nine out of,0.18524471
