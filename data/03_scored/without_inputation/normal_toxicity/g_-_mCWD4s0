so Alfonzo Kieran's Roma uh a lot of people know Alphonso Curran from stuff like gravity and children have been or if you've never seen any of those films you probably know him best from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,0.13171892
and if you if you're familiar with qur'an's work and stuff like you know gravity especially you know that he likes to do to do big and long and long one take shots where where he does like you know everything like you know you know like Goodfellas type stuff,0.15439986
or you know it's just like the one following camera and over one long shot which there is there's a lot of that in Romo but actually it's it's kind of interesting because Romo doesn't feel it does feel big in in terms of like how its shot and its scope,0.087353446
but its story it actually feels the story actually feels pretty pretty simple I mean in terms of how its set up here it takes place in the 1970s in Mexico City I believe yep in Mexico City or essentially we follow,0.08359548
this character of Cleo who's a made for this for this Mexican family,0.31089434
and she you know she she works,0.08106497
well with the kids,0.10522138
you know,0.07163658
she she likes them,0.15169837
she doesn't mind working for the family they they have a good relationship,0.08198984
you know the you know the mother and father they're they're not on good terms,0.2789396
but there are good terms with Cleo,0.032135855
they they like her and the kids like her too she's a great person but they have problems with you know with with you know like there's a revolution going on in their society where things seem very very heated out out there that you know that that it can be hard to you know to trust the world out there,0.15083341
so of course so Cleo feels a little bit more at home with the family,0.11633085
she feels like she can connect with the kids and stuff like that,0.13911664
but then kind of but then called like like tragedy strikes,0.08440084
when you know when when she connects with this one boy and she discovers that she's pregnant and once when she breaks this news to her boyfriend her boyfriend was basically just you know just out of there,0.14646748
he's like you know I pretty much,0.11619402
like won her on a date,0.08347595
and she says that oh I think I'm pregnant,0.1146482
he's gone out of there,0.09600963
and when she later confronts him he's just he's like no,0.32572943
it's not mine and he's because he's a martial artist,0.4824964
he gets a little bit violent about it saying like like no I'm not the father I'm not dealing with it goodbye,0.2761262
and so it's basically Clio trying to deal with her pregnancy while also trying to handle this family which the family is also going through some tough times with each other they're havin,0.09013289
they're havin some like the kids are kind of fighting with each other the mom and dad are fighting with each other,0.10674127
they're going into tough times and it's even tougher for Clio,0.06122458
and it's even tougher for society at large because there's a there's a revolution going on in the streets and people are running around and protesting and some people are getting shot right in front of them,0.31089434
that's just it's it's horrifying to them it'sit's quite the experience but I love the fact that we always feel focused on on Cleo Cleo is always always in focus,0.11404249
we always focus on her,0.11174834
we feel what she feels we hear what she hears and see what she sees and and I guess I mean I was gonna try to find a good way to segue into this,0.12812252
but I just I love the way that this one was shot,0.1981478
I love the way that they do have that they do kind of have like the long takes but they're not,0.10017833
it's kind of like elaborate long takes like there's one scene where they're in a where they're in a furniture store and they're they're looking for like a crib for Cleo's baby and they they're looking around and then they hear some noise outside and the camera kind of tilts around and it looks outside,0.08112446
and there's like a you know there's gunshots in the screen,0.15349324
there's all these protesters running they look down from the window locks on the second floor and then they pan over and they see some protesters run inside trying to hide and then while then we while we pan with them,0.098651
we see some you know some people coming after them with guns and they basically shoot them in the middle of the store there and then we focus back on on Cleo and her reaction and her hurting the terror on her face especially from what happens in that scene which I don't want to reveal there's a lot of tragic stuff that happens in this film that I don't want to reveal just because it's so heartbreaking and I love the fact that I don't think there's much music in the film - there's a lot of scenes where we don't rely on music we just rely on how it's you know how the scene is set,0.4031349
up you know what is the emotion what's happening with the,0.050282396
character especially there's one incredibly tragic moment that happens towards the third,0.058455404
act there's just there's no music at all it feels like it could have been music and again most of it's pretty much all in one take it feels like very much like a classic film you know where they they'd hold on a shot for as long as they could to draw out the drama from,0.1488606
it,0.046851393
and Kieran does that here,0.06932426
he does that here beautifully especially and a lot of people talked about this too on the scene at the beach the scene where were both Clio and the family are together at the beach,0.07275428
after they both gone through huge traumatic experiences,0.09585064
and they they basically they break down,0.13782428
they connect in that one scene that is that is beautifully played up just because like it's kind of on like one shot for you know,0.18473597
when you know when it happens,0.068159156
by the beach with like the waves and stuff like that,0.060501035
when they've just recovered from another trauma and when they all just kind of like come together in that one moment when they all connect on it's just,0.082761645
it's such a beautiful moment,0.05262741
I just just like the way it's shot in the way that we go about following Cleo which doesn't feel like,0.1020991
it's trying to be overbearing,0.070846565
it's just it works,0.0615564
so well you you get engaged with it especially because like like you've probably seen on the trailer,0.15224603
they have a bunch of like nothing moments,0.15258059
there's moments where like like Cleo is just like just,0.08501697
cleaning some clothes and like the kids will be be having like a game of like cops and robbers and like you know they'll start bickering with each other or there'll be a scene where you know,0.46069714
she's she's serving up one of the boys breakfast,0.36779618
and the boy starts just having these kind of like imaginary conversations about how you know like,0.08689359
oh I was I was a pilot before,0.06955647
I died it's like oh really and then and and then and even just like little moments that seem odd but but really say a lot like there's one scene where we get to learn about the household how the car has to park in the entryway which is very narrow,0.0705408
so like every time that their dad comes home,0.086801544
he has to be very careful about getting the car to the garage because it could like scrape against like the size of the wall and stuff like that little moments like that where we we really do get into Cleo's world um and and where we get to we get to know enough about this family,0.112531416
so that when tragedy strikes it strikes hard it,0.1181066
it really hits you to the core that there were there were moments in this where I was on the verge of tears with how with how with how much like horrible stuff happens to these characters and it's great because it doesn't feel like it's it's trying to go too over-the-top with the tragedy it feels it feels very rooted in reality as opposed to to melodrama and it actually plays out in a very very beautiful way that that if it doesn't that you know for some people I can imagine them seeing it as melodrama,0.11816394
but I think it plays out in a way that's that's very satisfying towards the end so so for roma i and i can't underst,0.058612168
I can immediately hear from people saying oh you know it's it's a foreign film it's black and white you know it's it's stuff that I'm not gonna understand I'm telling you if if you can understand you know what it's like being a parent or caring for kids or being in a relationship that doesn't work,0.18187825
I can't see why you wouldn't be able to connect with this,0.0848502
even for being you know a foreign film where it's all spoken in Spanish and it's all black and white and there's lots of like kind of like pillow shots of like water on the ground or or beer bottles on tables and stuff like that,0.10534422
I think I think people will still be able to connect with that and also come on it's beautifully shot like I said that scene at the beach is amazing,0.13391288
just all the the the cinematography is amazing,0.056305714
I love the the very human story,0.08734204
I mean this is you know Alfonzo Kieran you'll see deals and kind of like you know fantastical stuff like you know like children of men and gravity and Harry Potter but here this was probably this most human film and the more I thought about it,0.10174156
I kept thinking you know because it feels so human and more relatable,0.14086144
I think this this might be my favorite Alfonso Kira on film and that's saying something because I do really hold children of men up,0.21302657
there high like the those shots in children of men,0.64595205
were like with you know like a lot of people know the car sequence and then you know the the going up the apartment,0.050656874
you know one talk,0.07722581
well the going up the apartment stairs,0.049771152
one take shots,0.23970264
those are those are great,0.04471298
that's probably one of my favorite films ever,0.06215867
but I think I think roma Roma kind of beat seroma just has it feels like it has a lot more to say and it just it's it's such a great human story,0.13390571
that's easy to connect with that,0.056573063
I think I just I I can't get my mind,0.1012272
I'm still thinking about this film days after seeing it,0.081206396
so see after Roma 5 out of 5 stars I just what can I say it's it's my favorite,0.07419999
I'll found silkier on film at the moment until he makes his next one which you're soaping,0.23345234
you know,0.07163658
