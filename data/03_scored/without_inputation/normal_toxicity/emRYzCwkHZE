thanks and thank you so much it is greatly appreciated rebecca was released in 1940 directed by sir alfred hitchcock starring lawrence olivier and joan fontaine with other notable performances by george sanders and judith anderson okay on to a quick synopsis of the film it says a woman struggles with adjusting to her new role as an aristocrat's wife and living up to the expectations of his first wife oh this sounds like this is going to be fun i'm very excited to watch this,0.15109923
so at this point we are going to get into some historical background for those of you who want to jump right onto the film reaction go for it,0.10445541
but for those of you who want to stay we're going to get right into it rebecca was originally a novel written by daphne du maurier in 1938. de mourier was inspired by some of the events in charlotte bronte's jane eyre when writing her novel rebecca after rebecca was published it was an instant hit in both england and in the u.s there was a lot of excitement about making this novel into a picture,0.09232456
k brown and east coast story editor had recommended this novel to big time movie producer david o selznick and it was also k brown who had recommended gone with the win to him as well so her recommendations were pretty spot-on,0.15460272
so selznick was impressed with the novel and decided to buy the film rights for fifty thousand dollars which in today's money would be worth just shy of one million dollars,0.056438327
selznick also hired on alfred hitchcock to direct the film after noticing his success streak in england during the production of this film there were some creative differences between selznick and hitchcock selznick really wanted to stick as closely to the book as possible,0.10828363
and hitchcock wanted to lighten some of the dark gothic themes of the story now selznick would eventually go on to write hitchcock about his disdain of some of the substitutions that hitchcock added saying quote,0.3292193
we bought rebecca and we intend to make rebecca end quote now despite these differences rebecca was received very well with the audiences and it actually went on to be nominated for 11 oscars at the 13th annual academy awards,0.04809245
and it won two including best picture,0.06351216
okay on to some interesting facts now before this movie's release selznick allowed orson welles to release a radio version of rebecca and unsurprisingly it was a huge hit because as we know everything that orson welles touches turns to gold,0.1356928
so this was meant to draw up a lot of publicity for the film version,0.054922886
and once the radio version was released to the public everyone was super,0.08136534
excited to watch the film version of rebecca filming for rebecca started on september 8th 1939 which was just less than a week after the uk entered world war ii,0.10264575
now this became slightly problematic because a lot of the members of the cast were british so 80 years later in october of 2020 netflix released a remake of rebecca starring lily james and armie hammer and then finally this is the first criterion collection film that we are watching where i actually bought the physical,0.066188715
copy of the film i was so impressed with just the amount of care that they put into making just the packaging of this,0.08710535
and if you compare it to like say you know the good the bad and the ugly this feels really plastic like it's just a case to hold a dvd,0.42665836
but this one is like really well packaged by the way this video was not sponsored,0.1489403
i literally just wanted to share that with you because i was just blown away by the packaging um,0.24049588
now with all that being said i am very excited to get into this film,0.15048365
but before we do y'all already know the deal,0.054561023
if you haven't already please subscribe to the channel and hit that bell notification to stay in the loop all right everyone it is time to grab your snacks grab your drinks and let's get in to rebecca also,0.3122791

but you were just a teeny weeny bit forward with mr,0.53490317
winter your effort to enter the conversation quite embarrassed me and i'm sure it did him her forwardness,0.19147934
she didn't even say anything to him,0.2099112
she looked like she was so scared to talk to this de winters guy i was able to have lunch with me okay i'm here for her,0.36169508
i wasn't being polite,0.11977888
i should have asked you to have lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the bars so clumsily come along,0.31089434
oh he is so dashing,0.25644106
oh my god and it's it's made better by lawrence olivier's performance is mrs,0.10397449
van hopper a friend of yours no she's my employer i'm what is known as a paid companion,0.27778095
i looked at the word companion in the dictionary once it said a friend of the bosom,0.31089434
i can tell that her character is very like like naive like not having a whole lot of like world experience,0.31203356

i went there once with my father on holiday,0.09407827
i saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it right by the sea and the old lady said next man didn't i like the dialogue of this film so far because it doesn't feel like like doctored in any way i don't know if that makes sense but it feels like a very natural very natural conversation between two people i'm really liking the dialogue so far,0.14258057
it's just a place where i was born i've lived in all my life,0.25900143
now i don't suppose i could ever see it again,0.08022011
as soon as he started talking about his home manderly,0.103265606
his whole entire demeanor changed,0.17848028
he went from like pleasantly dashing to suddenly there's like secrets before she married she was the beautiful rebecca hildreth you know she was drowned here when she was sailing near mandalay he never talks about it of course,0.22015962
but he's a broken man,0.43812248

also look the way he looks at her y'all,0.13103184
i can't i don't know and she's excited because she's been like calling him weirdly for some reason,0.300809
i would fall so fast in love with this man,0.42455438
i asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement she's going to be madness who is the lucky lady i apologize for depriving you of your companion can i just can i just comment on that that pan into her face when she realizes that the winter is engaged to her employee,0.35753775
oh a beautiful way to depict that moment wow tennis lessons my foot i suppose i have to hand it to you for a fast workout,0.24900515
how did you manage it,0.10188695
i love the use of the pannins in this film i wonder if that is like a trademark of hitchcock,0.46795303
that was then used later on to show suspense,0.10297746
i don't know you better leave mrs,0.26353955
van,0.011592479
harper you'll miss your train mrs,0.23204423
dewinter goodbye maddie and i'm telling you as much as we all want to fall in love with maxim de winter okay he's gorgeous dashing the way he looks at her just makes your heart melt,0.21540509
but there's something else to him and i just i don't completely trust him,0.10707501
and why did he want to get married to her so quickly you know just questions you gotta start asking yourself the the questions of like you've only known each other for a couple of days,0.15934086
why do you want to get married to her so quickly um something's not completely right there's nobody that's mandating,0.16101189
oh wow it actually is really beautiful gorgeous,0.12002167
it looks kind of like a cottage ish cottage manor manor i don't know my house jargon okay i have everything in readiness for you,0.15292819
that's very good of you,0.112914585
oh i didn't express,0.07744334
this danvers,0.19234043
she gave her the up and down look she was like oh no this is like making my nerves bad mrs,0.31089434
danvers,0.12952426
i i do hope we beat friends i hope i should do everything to your satisfaction madam i've managed the house since mrs dewinter's death and mr,0.7492069
winter has never complained her eyes say so much like she says things,0.21236742
you can tell she is a woman who's very dedicated to her work,0.34559754
but her eyes tell a very different story,0.088254124
she is like looking at this new bride all up and down like you think you belong here,0.49485677
but you don't belong here like you just see it in her eyes that room in the west wing,0.40337917
i was telling you about is there through that door the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea it was mr,0.09543134
winters,0.042482845
i knew it i knew it was mrs,0.10310344
dewinter's room there'd be no other reason to board it up,0.082177766
oh and there's like a dog that just sits right in front of it,0.23972373
oh i wonder if they decided to use a black dog or like a darkly coated dog be to kind of signify like an omen of some sort,0.34278828
i don't know could be me,0.10688718
i love the the music in this,0.05665599
i think the music really does set the tone between scenes also because it's like the music starts to change a little bit like it was like light-hearted and fun,0.07919988
and now it's still light-hearted,0.0594155
but there's like little notes of of something a little bit darker in the music she's like still totally in love with him have a look at the times there's a thrilling article on what's the matter with english cricket oh my god laura it's olivier i could not act,0.24149366
with this man i would actually in real life fall in love with him my sister beatrice and her husband giles lacey have invited themselves over for lunch today already,0.4629801
he's literally leaving her to deal with his sister and her hus and her and her husband his sister and his sister's husband that's weird to say there's that dog again,0.47578353
yeah that i wonder if that dog is always like that dog is always there whenever,0.1503254
it's a room that the that rebecca would frequent,0.07581788
so yeah i wonder if this is like her study or something,0.098976225
i don't know oh i'm afraid you've made a mistake,0.23988034
mrs,0.077159755
dewind has been dead for over a year,0.28262213
oh i mean she's like i'm she's like when it's like mrs,0.240269
winter,0.08701134
she's so out of her depth,0.35365853
it's almost like she's expected to live up to this sort of idea this role that i don't think that she's ready for at all she had some pretty high profile friends,0.14940797
oh no i like that phone call that she received and she's like oh i'm sorry mrs,0.20134811
dewitt has been dead for over a year and then she hangs it up and she's like wait but i'm mrs,0.45082045
dewinter shall we sit down,0.19716746
you see she's bound to be insanely jealous at first and she must resent you bitterly why why should she she simply adored rebecca,0.3656048
so that's why she's all dark inside cause,0.4495862
she's like your tail like,0.69542736
i said she's like you're taking a place that is not yours like,0.22758906
oh no that could spell trouble,0.109311625
my dear you fond of dancing,0.11046867
well i love it,0.057781458
but i'm not very good at it,0.14973044
so but i'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do she sketches a little he doesn't even know what his wife does because they only know each other for like two days,0.27420926
he doesn't even know her what don't sail do you no,0.15027753
i don't thank goodness for that,0.084345736
oh so he wasn't supposed to mention sailing,0.079316355
oh no,0.062704295
what does that mean why don't you do something about your hair,0.3041439
no,0.06626663
it looks perfect,0.08289231
i can see by the way you dress,0.17691019
you,0.10154687
don't care who how you look wow,0.2977356
he must have changed a lot then wow the sister is really forward,0.056706656
i'm here for it you know the whole story no she doesn't i don't even think i know the whole story now we can have a walk about,0.12036366
the place runner get a coat from the flower room for mr,0.1225163
winter will you just hearing her being called mrs,0.24031416
dewinter doesn't even sound like right because i feel like this whole film we have been conditioned to think of rebecca as mrs dewinter and like this woman as his new wife you know where does that lead to,0.16125761
oh it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat,0.09174516
oh let's go down there all right we'll walk down and take a look if you really want to oh my god i love this,0.15509845
i love the romance of it but i just feel like it's too good to be true,0.051819377
he's heard himself,0.097753935
no,0.06626663
he's all right,0.074548244
leave,0.14781739
me alone don't you think i better go and see don't bother about him,0.2406264
i'll tell you he can't come to anyone he'll find his own way back,0.22826177
something happened there,0.030550575
there's no way,0.048298754
there's no way,0.048298754
he's reacting like that,0.11349186
because there's something happened there,0.037453387
oh and it opened by itself,0.13173686
don't go in there,0.09277263
i know that dog he comes for the elf,0.35379267
ew he's mr,0.08992006
de winter's dog,0.27719608
you're mrs,0.14427684
dewinter,0.04680874
oh that's weird,0.16751967
i didn't like the way he looked at her rebecca dewinda oh my goodness,0.15052673
she had some affiliation with that cottage know i didn't want you to go there,0.11281516
but you deliberately went,0.084423
oh because i hate the place,0.4635084
and if you had my memories you wouldn't go there or talk about it read and think about it you should never have come back to mandarin,0.15306373
he knows there's something that happened that something that he is not telling her secrets skeletons in the closet are those all rebecca's things down,0.18049353
there,0.016601479
yes,0.036876976
she was washed overboard wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone she wasn't afraid of anything,0.31451434
everyone knows something that this woman whose name has still not been mentioned,0.28649098
okay this woman and the audience don't know they know something because they're all super secretive and super,0.39526019
shady,0.11004207
i don't know,0.1465787
i don't know what's going on,0.113388956
they're all comparing me with him,0.24201378
yep with rebecca,0.07831715
you have qualities that are justified really big shoes,0.18298784
so throughout this film there you really do get the sense that she is being compared to this glorious rebecca de winter but then also there are people who are like yeah,0.123451
you're really sweet like they're like comparing her but then also reassuring her that she's like good or in a good position,0.20475355
and it just feels really strange,0.053326823
i don't know why tell me what was rebecca really like,0.06021609
i suppose she was the most beautiful creature,0.2499082
i ever saw oh well that makes you feel good,0.08261256
huh literally just negated everything he said to her to reassure her,0.15544116
oh she's trying you think there's something's right for you,0.1077435
doesn't seem your type at all,0.15797886
she loves him so desperate like i don't think that he loves her the way that she loves him,0.25535792
and the tragedy is that like he's trying to fill these,0.14869973
shoes of this woman who i'm not even really sure existed at this point okay because we still have not seen her and it's just sad,0.21748398
it's like don't compare yourself to someone who you'll never be you know,0.40310326
it appears that mrs,0.076577336
danvers has accused robert of stealing a valuable ornament from the morning room,0.29611924
what was the thing anyway china cupid sir oh yeah that's one of our treasures isn't it,0.24825177
it was it was the thing that she broke that is all i broke,0.19194219
the china cupid you broke,0.5320165
it is it possible to repair the ornament madam smashed into pieces,0.53490317
she looks man look at fruit fritz was even scared for a second,0.15078205
he was looking like oh no what's going to go down,0.18288124
she kept her composure but her eyes were like this he says dan must must be furious with me oh hang this down,0.5154597
oh,0.046070345
she should you be frightened of it cause,0.49708304
she's scary abstract is made or something,0.3229475
i do love how she how danvers really keeps her composure the whole time because you don't know what she's thinking i mean you can see it in her eyes right but like she's so calm about it and it just it intensifies things,0.2660267
i suppose that's why you married me never be any gossip about me got it whoa whoa the lighting's on his face,0.4031382
i also like how he really kept the audience in the dark here like in this film we're really as much in the dark as you know this woman who is this new mrs,0.1766769
dewinters i've gone up to london on some business of the estate,0.086204804
i shall return before evening and certainly this brief holiday from me should be welcome maxim,0.072123446
she's like in despair,0.3015777
she's like where's my maxim i'm sure she does not like that house or the people living in it looking for me left his little bride all alone this is mr,0.35983166
favel madam,0.12282502
i am rebecca's favorite cousin who one of rebecca's family members oh my god,0.06381715
i don't know what i love this this suspense,0.15524201
i don't know what to think right,0.17033747
now i'm so lost,0.18557999
don't go in there girl don't do it,0.25619465
i know you want to it's on your face,0.35135892
oh she's about to go in,0.08828029
and of course the room is big she looks so small in this big space and it's like symbolic of her like not being able to fill these shoes of mrs,0.36911273
dewinter,0.04680874
that's really i see what you did there hitchcock,0.53490317
i see what you did there,0.05053181
it's a picture of maxim kind of tells us that she really loved him,0.1537744
i love how we get the characterization of rebecca,0.08833725
she really is a main character in this film yet she's never physically seen,0.30471298
so that's really cool that we kind of get that in this,0.05918041
this is where i keep all her clothes feels like this is weird,0.36066407
they were made especially for her by the nuns and the convent of sinclair,0.36342084
oh wow how glorious that her her uh like her drawers like open like kind of like a lazy,0.6231016
susan almost where it like opens up and it's just like it's just so glorious wow i always used to wait up for her no matter how late sometimes she and mr,0.11663706
winter didn't come home until dawn very much admired her just hearing of the greatness of rebecca how everyone loved her all these things,0.06876836
it's furthering this poor woman's idea of herself like i'm never going to be this,0.40780258
i could never be this for max for manderley like i'm not this woman like it's this is a lot poor girl did you ever see anything so delicate,0.4259512
it is delicate wow like she looks visibly uncomfortable about this entire situation like it's kind of making me uncomfortable a little bit,0.19797002
i'm like i feel that secondhand like discomfort,0.1632966
do you think the dead come back and watch the living i don't believe it i wonder if she doesn't come back here,0.28678295
demandedly watch you and mr,0.09043608
winter together,0.101064704
you know that's probably not something that she wants to hear,0.10762022
it's probably not something,0.057896607
she wants to hear she's constantly surrounded by ideas and thoughts of rebecca it's like haunting her i am sister winter,0.19415586
now mrs,0.07636718
danvers gotta watch out for her thanks maximum could we have a costume ball,0.25043797
i feel that we ought to do something to to make people feel that mendel is just the same as it always was instead of cowering and like running away and being afraid she stood her ground and she's like no i am the new mrs,0.17116071
de winter and she like stood her ground okay honey,0.12248636
i see you boo,0.36074287
you might find a costume among the family portraits that would suit you,0.14370811
oh you mean those,0.06536346
at the top of the stairs i'll go and look at them,0.10209967
she is staging a war,0.4390624
oh my goodness i've heard mr,0.05563914
winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings,0.06517849
oh well well well that's a splendid idea mrs,0.16218686
danvers,0.1295243
i'm i'm very grateful um,0.0741596
i don't trust her,0.4119375
i don't trust her at all um,0.35161805
i wonder if that's rebecca and that costume is going to get a rise out of the winter,0.08877602
oh my god,0.059858862
i think that's what's going to happen,0.08408759
you were the first one down,0.2399022
yes where's the child well she's keeping a costume for every single show oh lovely,0.15132783
oh please don't come in beatrice,0.24120432
i don't want anyone to see my costume every single aspect of this film has some sort of like suspenseful leading on the audience,0.14664112
what's gonna happen next how's everyone gonna react like,0.101937786
he truly is the master of suspense,0.15708603
i just i'm scared i know something is off good evening mr,0.10037166
de winter oh my god,0.12609664
what did i say,0.082350135
what did i say dan vs staging a war,0.16329253
oh i watched you go down just as i watched her a year ago even in the same dress you couldn't compare you knew it,0.29201168
you never trust your enemy,0.45307088
dude mmm that naivety got her this time am i done,0.4481778
do you think you should never hate me so you're trying to take her,0.26688042
i knew it,0.05847697
i've seen his face,0.18387423
he doesn't love you,0.15281956
he wants to be alone again with her you have nothing to live for really have you,0.18702231
she is just tearing her down emotionally and mentally oh this scene is so powerful and we feel with this woman everything you are strong,0.56163603
you can do this fight,0.19389586
here,0.053441156
i'm talking as if she could listen she can't hear me she's like you could never compare to her like,0.47596654
what are you even doing like just tearing her down that was that was,0.33594707
and but here's the thing she did it keeping her composure very sinister stuff,0.24115033
i knew where rebecca's body was because i put it there what wait a second did he just confess to murder did he did he murder rebecca wait a second wait a second wait a second what is going on oh my god how could we be close when i knew you were always thinking of rebecca,0.44362402
you thought i loved rebecca i hated it,0.41500127
oh my god that changes everything this whole time i'm thinking to myself he just loved her so much and he's grieving her death,0.44499877
but no he just literally said he hated her,0.29081327
i want to hear his story,0.060413714
okay i was told i was the luckiest man in the world but i never had a moment's happiness with her she was incapable of love,0.334822
she stood there laughing and told me all about herself,0.22080539
oh my god,0.059858847
so what did rebecca,0.07160069
do i want like an origin story of rebecca,0.09560451
now i i need to know more about her so i'll play the part of a devoted wife mistress of your precious mandalay i'll make it the most famous show place in england,0.18870111
if you like i kept the bargain,0.09990892
and so did she apparently oh she played the game brilliantly so it's like we're really getting a full character analysis or a full character development of someone who we don't actually ever see i think that is fantastic,0.05520945
then there was a cousin of hers a man named favel,0.11553241
yes,0.036876976
i know him,0.05908668
why didn't you tell me,0.09290858
i thought it would remind you of rebecca,0.13976625
so i wonder if he really did marry,0.07741026
this woman because he really actually found love with her literally this plot twist just changed the entire perspective of the film oh my god,0.1491019
when i found that she'd come back quietly from london,0.13374038
i thought that favela was with her and i knew then that i couldn't stand this life of filth and deceit any longer okay,0.7130472
so favel is not rebecca's cousin,0.20541826
i think favelas might be her lover at least,0.2818099
that's what it sounds like that is so twisted a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her suddenly she got up started to walk toward me,0.18704806
oh my god and they're using the camera angles to literally show us her movements they're lit,0.13391468
they're literally characterizing a person who doesn't actually exist in terms of like like physically like she isn't physically there,0.15082704
and yet they're making her be there that is so strange,0.13010347
i must have stuck almost triumphant she stumbled and fell it's almost like she wanted him to kill her like to say i got you even in death,0.90173894
oh my gosh i remember wondering why she was still smiling and i realized she was dead but you didn't kill me she fell,0.5579655
it was an accident who would believe me,0.18018122
yeah yeah and and who would believe him because she's she's literally shown herself as like the devoted perfect wife nobody knows about her like secret life except for him,0.31089434
so no one would believe him,0.14892262
they're writing if they find out it was rebecca you must simply say that you made a mistake about the other body,0.12511906
she can't harm you anymore we're the only two,0.26499778
that's not true,0.055564683
no maxim you,0.3600068
and i she literally has not been shown this entire film and still somehow she is still the strongest character in this film there's nothing you can do,0.083059475
she won i loved you my darling he really did love her no no she hasn't won no matter what happens,0.29531738
now she hasn't won bro she totally won like i'm just so blown away at the fact that she literally has not even been physically shown yet she holds more pow the freaking movie is named after her,0.561333
okay this is this is rebecca's movie she is the shining star of the film and we don't even see her i am floored,0.08899033
i don't mind,0.11586387
this whole thing except for you he loves her,0.17265092
oh we still have this strong romance that we can still root for you know that we're like okay,0.091395296
he truly loves her he truly wants to be with her which i like i don't know nothing,0.31089434
i don't want to go to the asylum clearly,0.16578954
he didn't see anything,0.068157464
okay move on anyway,0.14978968
i feel bad that i misjudged him in the beginning he was a little creepy,0.39403167
i'm not gonna lie,0.16600801
but you know what he truly was just kind of like a a bystander,0.10749391
mr,0.06176657
winter,0.08701134
please,0.054873075
i have to ask you a very personal question where relations between you,0.23386696
and the late mr winter perfectly happy,0.07121704
she looks like she's literally about to blow and say something and screw everything up,0.69542736
she just needs to chill out i won't stand this any longer and you might as well know now will adjourn to oh lunch mr,0.20317738
winter i presume you'll be available for us then oh my god this is so intense darling wait here a few moments,0.07823445
i'll see if i can find old frank and how does the bride find herself today,0.09442014
you know you've grown up a bit since i lost this oil,0.24132243
what do you want for them,0.07427657
you can also kind of see that in the the wardrobe or the costuming choices that they've used throughout the film,0.054503754
she looks like,0.09176928
she really has grown up like this really has taken the innocence right out of her i find myself in a rather awkward position it's from rebecca and what's more she had the foresight to put the date on it but i can assure you that it is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night,0.3513793
i'm not gonna lie,0.16600806
i kind of like favel's character like he's like he's sly but he does it very like charismatically,0.21458475
he's like i know what's going on you know like i don't know i really like his character,0.15098697
even though i feel like he's a bad guy,0.46676838
he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest,0.07602035
if i made it worth his while just seen the doctor and i'm going down to mandalay right away,0.16732839
i have something terribly important to tell you rebecca i thought the letter was going to be something like like more in-depth like you know starting a new life,0.09589189
hey,0.048055597
maybe this kid might be yours,0.16063572
i still don't know if that's her cousin ah here,0.31966314
she is the missing link apply the motives i believe you'll know everyone else and we know that she is like in total admiration of rebecca,0.10002248
so she's oh something's gonna go down,0.31089434
i feel it who was rebecca's doctor i don't know anything about it,0.1274325
oh don't give me that danny you knew everything about rebecca,0.23043749
you knew she was in love with me didn't you love was a game to her only a game it made her laugh,0.17527805
i tell you i knew that i knew that,0.080548964
she admired that dark side of rebecca,0.08300858
i knew it it has been suggested mrs,0.09479636
dewinter was deliberately murdered,0.54533076
the name of the murderer,0.46439007
it's a lovely name george fortescue maximilian de winter look at her face the first time she's shown emotion on her face we don't want,0.2669644
reminiscences danny what was his name dr,0.15056384
baker 165 goldhawk road shepherd's bush there,0.057736896
you are colonel there's where you'll find your motive he is just a little freaking rat that is the first time,0.747439
i'd ever seen emotion on her face i've never attended a mrs,0.4300142
winter in my life,0.22151177
the lady must have used an assumed name the woman was very seriously,0.14013828
ill,0.28739366
what was wrong with her cancer that would have given her motive to want to take her life,0.5029965
literally this plan the favela had literally backfired on him,0.32956034
that's what you get for being a douchebag,0.912879
there was nothing that could be done for her except wait she smiled in a queer sort of way when i told her it was a matter of months,0.31089434
she said oh no doctor not that long,0.20869389
she knew she was gonna die,0.69542736
and she had pla like she planned this she planned this cunning woman please just let them live in peace danvers,0.38321027
please they've been through,0.0751901
so much oh my god she's gonna set up she's gonna set a fire she's gonna set a fire i can i can see it,0.37604168
she has the candle,0.15448996
she has the crazy eyes,0.6811422
oh my god,0.059858862
she's gonna commit arson just dry,0.31089434
it,0.046851434
it's that's not the northern lights,0.07032994
that's mandalay she's totally dead,0.53490317

oh jesus thank you,0.087132856
thank you,0.039406788
thank you that she made it out,0.10141709
i was literally freaking out she she's in there she looks crazy that final scene with vr,0.55577993
oh what a film that was fantastic that had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end like all of the twists and at the end it just kept coming just new information just pow pow pow right at us,0.10776882
i mean that was fantastic,0.11742327
i think that was so good you never saw rebecca and yet she was such a prevalent figure in this film,0.15481766
so the fact that they were able to make this character so real and so like visceral without actually having her physically there is astounding,0.17577404
it was fantastic,0.09903128
and then the plot twists where like we got to see a different side of rebecca,0.058268283
not this brilliant beautiful cunning woman but this like sadistic sinister monster even though mr,0.7754064
dewinter maxim didn't tell us what she had said to him after those four days of marriage we still got the sense that it was something that was a lot darker than you know what she was letting on on the surface,0.09181611
i definitely have to give that one a 10. like that was so good it,0.043567482
