about their treatment of the farmers is a real highlight as well as the eventual,0.103054516
reveal about his characters past and part of me is always wondered if akira toriyama,0.10182998

the character of kikuchiyo is extremely similar in a lot of ways he's very optimistic,0.091241166

while we watching this movie to prepare for this review it's very obvious that a,0.06923182

you're given this period to breathe about what you just saw and reflect on what,0.19139522
it means for the characters something else that Kurosawa understands very well and particularly in,0.052139934
this film is the use of character perspective a point of view that he turns,0.1375456

highlights the feeling he wants the audience to have I think it's one of the,0.07112964
reasons Monet is so incredible we often see him from the point of view of,0.085335396
the other samurai because they think he's a bit of an oddball but in the,0.27930522
moments where his character is given the opportunity to take over the whole frame he,0.0526415
lets his real self out and it's captivating the battle sequences are still absorbing today,0.061969593
and it shows just how observant Kurosawa was with his immaculate framing and I've always,0.06834796
felt sorry for some of the stuntmen particularly this guy because that looks genuinely painful,0.19321068
