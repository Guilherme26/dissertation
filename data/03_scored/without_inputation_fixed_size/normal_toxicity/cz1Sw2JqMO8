from Anton Karras an Austrian musician is really central it's an important part of the,0.14906925
opening theme and it permeates through the rest of the film the look of this,0.070050456
film was really engaging as well it's the first British production to use extensive location,0.081197664
shooting it was also the first British film and started to try and create the,0.11494808
neorealistic style of directors like Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini now Reed actually had three,0.23980384
film units on this particular shoot there was a daytime unit there was a nighttime,0.12984903
unit and interestingly there was a silly unit now he oversaw all three of those,0.44857472
particular film units which meant he was sometimes working up to about 20 hours a,0.061161168
day it showed how much he cared about this film and how much he exerted,0.13897334
his control over how it was made and I think the results speak for themselves,0.06427476
Reid was keen to give the film a very local feel beyond the location shooting,0.104283206
he'd used lots of locals in key extras roles you'll see in some key scenes,0.074863985
that balloon seller he was a local from Vienna police officers with Vienna sewer unit,0.18624339
so they were quite accustomed to working in those particular parts of the city and,0.03502367
the fire department played a really important role as well you'll notice a number of,0.057303075
the nighttime scenes the cobblestones the sidewalks the streets are wet Carol reused his lighting,0.19508564
and the reflection off those streets to really bring those nighttime scenes to life so,0.11347405
all these people played a really important role in the look with a film and,0.08164686
making it look as authentic as it actually is the other important aspect of this,0.08643665
film is the symbolism very early in the film Holly Martin's played by Joseph Cotten,0.033323616
walks under a ladder without hesitating it's a foreboding scene in which you sense that,0.10218752
he's going to have no luck during the rest of the film during a lot,0.07672939
of key scenes in the film Carol Reed uses what's what is called Dutch angles,0.057494145
so framing the shot in a way where things don't look square they look off-kilter,0.24142654
a little bit and that gives us a sense of unease that things aren't as,0.06466541
they seem equally with all the nighttime shooting and the shooting in the sewers there's,0.26554373
lots of shadows and and and things are moving in ways where we can't be,0.07002572
certain what's actually happening again that underlines the fact that I start as the story,0.048231464
goes we're not entirely certain what's happening at all times over now this is also,0.07472857
a great story it was written by Graham Greene it was the only original screenplay,0.06312206
he ever wrote he was sent to Vienna in 1948 by one of the other,0.15025428
producers Alexander Korda he wanted him to get a sense of the city and and,0.06315499
build a story for him around that now Greene did a number of tours around,0.08095345
the city including the sewers some of the city and Nights plots he spoke to,0.05263725
a lot of people and he got an understanding of how the black market worked,0.11905223
in Vienna as well and he incorporated a lot of those elements into the story,0.086005054
he also wrote a story which it was incredibly well structured it seems to be,0.07867419
to me a story in two parts we start out thinking we're dealing with the,0.077898145
murder mystery and then transitions into a crime drama again during the course of the,0.25244716
storytelling more and more as a real bet each of the characters that none of,0.06022412
them are what they seem and as a result we don't know who to trust,0.24687853
we don't know he did who to cheer for in a lot of ways we,0.11289568

the sewer he was played by a body double wells his greatest contribution to this,0.18850614
particular film is his cuckoo-clock monologue it's very famous it's one of the key elements,0.37795216
of the film and again let's pause for a moment just to listen to that,0.045427598
