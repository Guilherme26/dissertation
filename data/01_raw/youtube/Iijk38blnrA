this movie is considered one of the greatest movies of all time it's like considered the goat of movies the Tom Brady of movies the Jordan of movies The Godfather from the year 1972 I've every quest to review it so you'll better get my thoughts on this movie today what's up welcome to another episode of movie breakdown I'm your host Ollie's doctor and artisan opener I'm reviewing the Godfather it was a request from Facebook a personal Facebook asked me to review Godfather 1 in 2 & 3 also he every review bunch of other movies such as casino and good fellows and this something goes out there please review know the other one we got to review is king of New York I believe the king of New York which I'm looking forward to that one of her is a really good movie as well and it's also there's a movie reviews want me to review let me know because I will review it and give it a great and sometimes gonna be like with the status quo what people thinking other times like today it's gonna be different The Godfather is considered one of the greats as I said opening up this video but to me this movie wasn't that good I did not get into the movie I could not get into movie I try watching movie twice and the first time I watched it I said through it and almost fell asleep on it and now it's like look Tosa wait what happened alright let me go back refocus and car wash just couldn't do it plus the movies 3 hours long and when the movies really good and you're really into it 3 hours of the matter would but when you're not into it you're like oh my gosh this is it's really long and to me the movie with slow pace really slow play so I was like all right I need focus second time I try to watch and start sitting focused through it couldn't do it could do it I you know I got to open this thing got to the wedding got through the Horsehead in in in the bay by what is spoilers but there's a horse head in his dudes bed cuz I do rejected one of the mob bosses proposals or something they're pretty much up says somebody and he cut off his favorite horse and put him his put it in his bed when I was thinking he didn't feel that throughout the night he and filled him taking his covers off and shoving this giant horse head into the bed it didn't to do get some screens and like his acting for that it was really bad it's so cheesy so cheesy but yeah movie I try watch it again it was so slow pace I just couldn't sit through it and every time I look I'm like oh my gosh all right so we get to action saying okay cool I made through that all right just necessary shooting unnecessary killing no not gonna I can't like this movie to me it's not that good there's nothing good I'm sorry and you can go in the comment section you can rate all you want and arrange it how you not like the Godfather it just was not wasn't on my cup of tea it was not my movie I'm sorry I tried not honest as a classic but there's classics that are really good in in catching to me and this movie wasn't that good nor catching to me the actors in the movie though were great just the way the storyline was set up wasn't that's great and I had to look at the summary to figure out what was Isabel and as I try to watch it multiple times I'd look at the summary is about how though the main mob boss is handing over his empire to his son and just was not happening like the Sunday want to have the company dad not to come he didn't want to own the mob he didn't want to be the new layer in charge he didn't wanna be that guy I didn't get that watching this movie and all before I get into the characters I didn't say one thing I didn't understand about this movie and like I looked at the storyline nice I just said if he says I looked up storyline and Seawolves what the movie was about and I already know who the main antagonist is who like who's main antagonist is in this movie I got another protagonist and like the that most iconic characters you see but I don't know who the antagonist are like I just just it's not my movie yes and I'm a movie the actors in this movie had alpha Chino who played Michael Chloe on Chloe on clorium I shouldn't know how to pronounce that name such a famous name but opportunity did a great job Marlon Brando who played Don Vito Chloe young I feel like I'm saying a name so wrong no they all did a great job like the acting wasn't bad acting was not the problem for me this movies like all the people was in this movie great just the storyline was not that good of a storyline it's like watching WB eview wrestling fans out there you have these great wrestlers but then the storyline they get put into suck like the stir line the the company rights for the wrestlers suck and no matter how great that wrestler is you can put the Wayne the rock Johnson versus Stone Cold Steve Austin and you had them fight over pudding people will lose their mind like why are these two great wrestlers fighting over pudding like their storyline like it's a horrible story line that's how I felt like this movie was a horrible story line for a movie I'm done alright so she watches moving a Friday night to me personal opinion no this is not a Friday night movie this probably movie you probably have to sit down and watching on a Saturday or Friday day or a Tuesday day or day he was just like you just want to watch a movie this is probably that kind of movie grading Tom I'm personally gonna grade The Godfather Part 1 I'm grading this movie a solid D I went silent there so you guys can yell and get all your anger and frustration out of yourself and you can yell the YouTube screen right now you can type in the comments section you can let your audios listen audio he can yell it on soundcloud and tight for my soundcloud say you're a horrible movie critic and i'm gonna get all this folks for this but i was taking to my guns I'm great in this movie a solid D I just could not get into this movie to me it was not the greatest movie ever and maybe
