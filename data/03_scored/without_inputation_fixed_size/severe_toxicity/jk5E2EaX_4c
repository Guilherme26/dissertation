gonna work for every horror movie Jaws isn't working I know why they did it,0.061908644
for Jaws it's cuz it was too complicated to show you this mechanical shark they,0.042456675
had brewing so they kept everything under the surface cuz I watched the first 10,0.036100846
minutes of the Steven Spielberg documentary and he told us that's why you see less,0.017301427
of the shark and luckily it paid off a lot of filmmakers like let's do,0.03273036
