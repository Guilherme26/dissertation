hey how's it going everyone angie is back again for another movie review and today,0.014095241
I'm gonna be hitting you guys with my thoughts on the latest Pixar movie and,0.6605478
that film is of course Coco now this film is very interesting because I'm just,0.033326365
gonna say right now Coco is one of the best experiences that I've ever had,0.02390537
seeing a Pixar film in theaters and this has really reinvigorated my love for the,0.03454698
company because you know as it stands in the past ten years of Pixar movies,0.025492499
what we've had a lot of great standouts such as up and Toy Story three,0.0260752
everything else has just sort of been met - okay that was great for what,0.04498637
it was like for example movies that I personally enjoyed but to be honest I,0.03422037
didn't feel they were 100% necessary you know the Monsters Inc prequel what was that,0.036088873
all about finding dory while it was fun it was just kind of like okay,0.07620211
did we really need this this feels like it could have been its own animated,0.048936896
series and then you just get things that you got to avoid entirely such as,0.021777447
the car astrology and then you have stuff that doesn't even feel like it was,0.032518834
made by Pixar it looks more like a DreamWorks title that movie being brave so,0.02332666
well we've had good movies like inside out I was kind of waiting for like,0.05179253
the next big thing from Pixar the next thing that would just you know mark,0.031235693
it's whatever thing on the Pixar legacy floor mat or whatever that I'm tapping on,0.039542507
that's short of stick and thankfully Coco delivered on that front Coco is without a,0.046666622
doubt one of the most unpick star movies that there is as I was watching,0.029427724
this movie I kept thinking to myself like yo this is not really something that's,0.047706306
up Pixar's ality not to say that all Pixar movies are the same but they,0.040305473
kind of have that regular stick like Oh what would you do if toys could,0.08506302
talk what hilarious hijinks would they get into Oh what would you do if ants,0.18195833
can talk let's see the hilarious hijinks that they get into but with Coco it,0.13794911
just I couldn't put it in a box and that's what I loved about it,0.040128533
yes you could say stuff like oh it's a story about skeletons and they're talking,0.016487243
but it's really not the point of Coco at its core Coco is a movie,0.017340673
about family which I'm sure you could get from watching any of the trailers and,0.029095799
seeing commercials and stuff aspect of Koko is one of the most important parts about,0.03525407
it and I absolutely loved the way Pixar handled approaching the concept of family and,0.031583585
what it means because when you have these animated movies especially kids movies the like,0.08417034
these big themes like family and friendship for the most part they're done in a,0.029413091
very cheesy way that's just ok yeah it's fun for the five-year-olds but what about,0.030313749
for the people who are like 20 plus years old like what are we gonna,0.047462847
get out of this what are we gonna learn with Coppola they were able to,0.18126054
show you that family is very important and it shows that not all families are,0.026334621
perfect perfect example the main character in this movie named Miguel he has this dream,0.053371675
of being the world's greatest musician he loves music but due to circumstances that I'm,0.04891029
not gonna spoil with his family he doesn't really have the opportunity to do that,0.034411944
because they're just so set in their ways on avoiding music because there's very there's,0.0449438
a very negative connotation with the music and it deals with the family lineage as,0.019884335
well and I love the way that they tackle that sort of stick I mean,0.101298824
it's not groundbreaking by any stretch of the imagination but it's done with a lot,0.041595265
of heart and that's what I really love if they're gonna be taking these stories,0.05281026
that people have done time and time again like the stories of friendship and family,0.020498965
and what it means you know more often than not people like to turn it,0.088094264
on their heads and make it like like fast in a few years for example,0.08245018
not saying those are bad movies but they really plan the fact that family is,0.026126418
not just blood family is people you have connections with that's a good representation of,0.109818496
that but again it's sort of kind of a given like okay you would go,0.07640765
that route Coco still has the same basic functions of what it means to be,0.025381412
a family but it makes it feel genuine and real because I'm sure many of,0.02291491
us have gone through the situation and it's not done in a real ham-fisted over-the-top,0.09412681
cheesy way so in that respect I really liked it and in terms of just,0.031831034
how beautiful this movie was I was just so surprised at the color palette and,0.029753
how much just life existed in the movie everything just felt so freakin Pixar is,0.24897446
unmatched when it comes to that I mean they're a great looking DreamWorks films and,0.04985219
blue sky or whatever but when you watch this movie and you look at the,0.029652556
attention to detail that exists on the characters clothes and their hair and like for,0.02308786
example whenever they come in contact with water it's just honestly felt like I was,0.03366162
watching human beings moving pixar's dangerously close to the point where we can actually see,0.05304507
realistic characters on screen and it doesn't look CG like that's where they've gotten to,0.028121304
the point and it's just it's phenomenal I loved the look of this movie I,0.041339166
loved the look of you know just like they just sheer amount of color that,0.22360997
exists with it because it really goes well with the themes of the film you,0.021841304
know a couple that with the fact that the movie in general has a lot,0.026629297
of humor and heart attached to it I think that a lot of people are,0.02416213
gonna get a ton of enjoyment out of Coco it's a movie that I think,0.08682376
will appeal to everybody whether they are a kid or whether they are a adult,0.069199055
especially considering it tackles so many adult esketh Eames that you don't necessarily see a,0.12118981
lot in kids mediums like cartoons they don't really talk about the concept of family,0.06363746
and how things get divisive and how the like dealing with the concept of death,0.16465756
and passing on and what that means and just overcoming like these are things that,0.025719326
I watch the movies when I was a kid like 20 years ago and the,0.032727037
fact that we're still getting these movies is really awesome because I can show these,0.037590194
movies to my eventual kids one day and say hey I grew up with this,0.046792343
this is a great movie that explains this to you and that's you you know,0.03500263
I had the Lion King you know teach me the understanding that you know death,0.2753001
isn't necessarily a bad thing you have to take your place in the world when,0.036007054
the time comes likewise I can show my children Coco and what this really means,0.060100008
and how family is important even though we bicker through this and then the other,0.024143506
so yeah man Coco on that front was awesome and can I also point out,0.07797549
the fact that this is one of the darker Pixar movies like I'm not gonna,0.09820106
spoil anything but there's a moment in this movie where they just go straight up,0.10133607
M night Shyamalan like really good M night Shyamalan like and night Shyamalan twist that's,0.06969794
just like whoa you know I'm saying I had two of those in this movie,0.07370634
and it's just so on Pixar because they do not beat around the bush they,0.071016334
tell you exactly what happened and I got to credit them for that because they,0.024442839
don't pull you for a fool like oh this happened because of something corny and,0.46955281
cheesy no this happened because this is how what happened in the real life so,0.044527393
yeah we're gonna do that I was left speechless and I I'm pretty sure a,0.010588394
lot of the parents were in there just like whoa look away kids and they're,0.11025153
just watching like yes this is this this is what I paid $15 for yeah,0.027204681
yes intrigued but in closing guys I freaking loved Coco it's definitely one of my,0.11911377
favorite Pixar movies and by the end of it like many folks I was very,0.036909044
close to shedding a tear I honestly didn't expect it until I just got this,0.039212577
rush of emotions and it was just like oh man I'm so happy but so,0.023987187
sad Oh comment down below if this movie made you feel emotional in any way,0.05003711
shape or form what did you think about Coco let me know down below in,0.058364544
the comment sections and for meteor for now my name is NGS signing out and,0.017576812
