Logan logan is a movie about showcasing the life of a superhero in a world,0.056255247
in which superheroes lost it is a superhero story but not one that we've seen,0.03816092
explored all too often it's a movie that balances the complexities of a broken-down super,0.048380136
human having to live as a normal person Logan in this film is a shadow,0.124200426
of his former self a man who decided that yes I'd rather take a bullet,0.44781813
than let my car get damaged he drives the limousine by the way yes Wolverine,0.08565836
drives a limousine in this movie the x-men are dead it's at this point right,0.264949
at the very beginning that the movie slams you in the face the people we've,0.14126904
been following all this time these heroes these icons are gone and one of their,0.031169841
own is to blame Charles Xavier easily the most paternal character the one that should,0.026903352
have been saving them humanity is what the x-men technically lost against not an evil,0.03225409
super villain or a mutant god Charles Xavier started to manifest Alzheimer's and lost control,0.07518305
of his powerful telepathic abilities Wolverine is dying due to metal poisoning from the adamantium,0.13281722
in his system the things that should make these characters larger than life is what,0.018985007
is causing them pain and with Xavier not even remembering what he did because of,0.09780993
what he has Logan has to carry Xavier is pain as well Logan is just,0.047516063
fully engine for this entire movie I mean let's be honest the x-men universe started,0.085168116
and should end with Wolverine right actually I'm lying the x-men universe started with rogue,0.21367228
and that isn't a joke I'm not smart enough to make a complex joke like,0.022204496
that I mean maybe that's why Cyclops storm and Jean were such cardboard cutouts in,0.027026411
the movie they focus too much on how to give rogue a white streak of,0.19677263
hair and forgot about literally the rest of the x-men either way even though rogue,0.117632404
pretty much started this whole thing it was her journey in the first film and,0.023747722
then Wolverine tagged along and he both mutually helped each other the main protagonist of,0.024200711
the film x-men is Wolverine and so I still stand by my belief that the,0.06170975
x-men universe should have ended with Logan right why is it that you releasing trailer,0.033195324
you're pushing your movie back to June while speaking with IGN Ken Berg talked a,0.028941475
bit about what fans could expect from gambit movie fresh Dark Phoenix we are ripping,0.09803676
that family apart the next few years there was no mention of gambit I suppose,0.02765767
that means the film is officially dead now New Mutants is going through reshoot so,0.18029337
it's been delayed for early 2019 I'm sorry I wait I mean no it's actually,0.038649164
it's actually delayed again and they still have to do the reshoots yeah great and,0.07090392
finally Dark Phoenix a movie that looks so mediocre that if you look up mediocre,0.28223598
in the dictionary you're gonna find a poster so this video is being edited to,0.08234841
then be released but then Dark Phoenix actually came out and the women are always,0.07810054
saving the men around here you might want to think about changing the name to,0.03355652
ex women it's not very good is it what I do like about it is,0.31167674
that it does feel like it tries even though it was rushed reshot multiple times,0.02776809
it does feel like people were trying to make a decent movie it didn't work,0.03254544
at all but they tried I thought the opening of the movie was solid I,0.027621752
thought Hans Zimmer's score was fantastic like most would expect unsurprisingly some of the best,0.041974418
parts of the movie are just Charles and Erik James McAvoy or McAvoy and Michael,0.009747601
Fassbender gives some great performances just like first class just like Days of Future past,0.10184959
they're actually trying also the main villain in Dark Phoenix IRA Cotter named Jessica Chastain's,0.035651848
character I mean she tries she's very forgettable what's funny is that I would rather,0.047703646
watch x-men The Last Stand than Dark Phoenix but anyways if you do want to,0.033258516
watch a good x-men movie just watch first class Days of Future past Logan they're,0.041860674
all much better anyways back to the video that was previously edited at the end,0.046735805
of the day Dark Phoenix being good or not it still feels hollow because the,0.030766074
main character Jean Grey has only had one movie to really showcase herself we haven't,0.030551884
gone through a whole journey with her it's only been one movie and she wasn't,0.037411924
even the main star thinking about it now the scene most people remember from her,0.020043314
debut film apocalypse is the scene in which Professor Xavier lost his hair damn it's,0.580494
like history repeats itself anyways back to Logan because you see Logan is a Rhapsody,0.037634093
it's a film dedicated to showcasing the emotions that Logan goes through and his journey,0.020306062
towards becoming a true hero once again a path which took all of his friends,0.034601524
and in the end the path that takes his life as well at the beginning,0.028598906
of the film he risks his life for a car would he valued most at,0.0408323
the moment and at the end of the film he risks his life for his,0.06061486
heart the end of the movie serves as a Requiem not only for Logan but,0.017913396
for the x-men as well that there's something more than just superhuman they're symbols of,0.034471814
heroism Laura practically turning his grave into a monument showcases this I'm gonna be honest,0.16674824
here on first watch I never really bought Laura and Logan's relationship I felt her,0.03971612
calling Logan dad was way too sudden but upon re-watching it it didn't bother me,0.044230055
as much I do think the movie had to deal with a lot and it,0.034301527
isn't perfect but who was still effective my personal favorite x-men film his first class,0.064135015
but that doesn't mean that movie doesn't have problems to every movie has problems except,0.010443383
for cat one and for me would turn me off a bit from Logan and,0.12349533
still kind of turns me off is how odd it feels to randomly have a,0.0623317
bunch of mutant kids come out in oh where they're talked about in the movie,0.3108831
but their appearance feels a little bit sudden to me but still plot wise it,0.04783269
makes sense as it's Laura's journey to reach them and Logan is ensuring this happens,0.023048613
and they can escape jarring or not it doesn't take away from the fact that,0.011787054
Logan's journey is one of reclaiming his status as a hero as an icon that,0.024815341
has comic books made about him one that isn't defined by his violent past but,0.032879364
a hero that can surpass the horrors that have plagued his life thanks to being,0.059429504
free from a sense of responsibility as he ensures that his daughter and the future,0.03634031
generation will survive he can peacefully die in the closer looks video on Logan which,0.10501321
is fantastic and I urge you to watch it if you haven't it was said,0.059357
that the MCU would never achieve this sort of finale in which you feel true,0.049349308
closure and in the video Dead that Tony Stark would never have this happened to,0.18924342
him because he just can't die his stories these days aren't dictated by what would,0.07758702
be best for these characters but what is most profitable thankfully the Russos and Kevin,0.026850138
Feige and the rest of those behind endgame decided to tell a fulfilling character-driven story,0.023441738
and not showcase another product and tony dize a good death a poetic death now,0.31077355
while Logan did have his poetic death as well sadly Fox did not do this,0.08970999
for the rest of the x-men because they've kept milking a profitable franchise to me,0.09358203
Logan should have been the end of Bryan Singer's x-men universe but we were hit,0.1301312
with apocalypse and now Dark Phoenix with the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disney,0.036937647
completed the x-men won't get her triumphant last hurrah the x-men will go out in,0.10815088
a whimper and not in the good whimper kind of way as Logan was able,0.04917636
to pull off high stakes without having the and in its third act by going,0.085235305
out in a whimper I mean the x-men property won't get its endgame its Rises,0.08512887
its hidden world it'll get a delayed film that gets memes on all the time,0.09009979
it almost makes me want arc Phoenix to be good because this nearly 20 year,0.020332003
long saga shouldn't end in such a mediocre way but what can you do when,0.16786042
the company only cares about money and not a good film that only goes to,0.034859613
show how powerful Logan is what are the repercussions of being a hero how much,0.017631358
violence can a hero take before they snap in the never-ending battle of good versus,0.12135677
evil does good truly win every time in the end it's all a blur but,0.073216766
there is hope for a brighter future the new generation that pays tribute to the,0.023353932
old one it's a finale to one of the greatest superheroes ever put to screen,0.094358295
one that will go down in history and it also works as a finale to,0.03753831
the x-men a true ending even after the ending of Days of Future past seventeen,0.087757014
years of film finally brought to an end in a very small personal level no,0.035774905
one can just look at Hugh Jackman and see Hugh Jackman anymore they'll always remember,0.023213578
that this dude was once Wolverine he defined the character and he got the beautiful,0.032500207
ending he deserved now before I go I have a question for you have you,0.48032385
