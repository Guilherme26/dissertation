hey y'all welcome back this is my review of Jun ho bongs 2019 film parasite,0.15886049
Joon ho bong is a South Korean director so this is definitely a foreign film,0.078057304
subtitles everywhere and which I don't mind I love foreign films and he is the,0.059464756
director of okhta from 2017 magnificent animated movie there and he also did snowpiercer with,0.029775616
Chris Evans back in 2014 I think or 2013 that also is a great movie,0.011353355
and parasite is more along the lines of snowpiercer and that it examines the disparity,0.14281094
between rich people and poor people and what the poor people will do in order,0.24652372
to get rich and what the rich people will do in order to stay rich,0.104598135
but it doesn't go so far as to show that the levels in snowpiercer it,0.028407333
mostly focuses on this poor family in South Korea and what they do in order,0.08638939
to sort of get a leg up in society they're poor in the way that,0.2937101
it's kind of comical but kind of terrible at the same time because they live,0.07637306
in a sort of like a basement of an apartment building their windows face the,0.053980984
street so we got them there they're you know living quarters and then the street,0.08355305
levels right here so they can see people walking around and they can see all,0.03674807
the activity outside and so when their windows are open all they get is noise,0.024668336
from the street and everything so there's not going on and I say they were,0.044423625
so poor that their dad he advises them to keep the windows open so that,0.07912227
when exterminators come around with you know their gas and they're shooting everything everywhere that,0.45437533
some of that fumigation can go into their little apartment and then kill their bugs,0.6188241
and that way they don't have to pay for the fumigation at all so kind,0.37493035
of funny but still kind of terrible that you got to be in that situation,0.09004126
and it's that the movie was on that kind of a road for a good,0.048142
a good 50% of the movie was like that was really kind of funny watching,0.03310619
them con this wealthier family and it was very good satire as to how a,0.03104279
lot of poor people have to be like super-smart in order to survive basically so,0.13891296
while it shows that a lot of poor people have to work extra hard at,0.11552045
getting smart or or or becoming athletic or anything like that in order to get,0.035877343
out of poverty it also shows that once people get rich they kind of stop,0.06622635
learning things they're a bit more soft as far as as far as dealing with,0.09354145
the world is concerned because they're more insulated along or along their own rich communities,0.034623474
you know they're not exposed to everything out there in the world so it the,0.051286325
movie does a really good job of showing those two those two different worlds really,0.020816922
and how this family integrates itself into working for this rich family basically taken advantage,0.15735385
of then they're conning them and I loved how the the rich people aren't made,0.2710181
to be the villains or the victims and neither are the poor folks you know,0.08001827
the poor folks that in this movie do what they got to do it's fraud,0.058234833
it's wrong but they do it right and the rich folks are completely unaware so,0.026350586
what's going on with them they're just kind of like falling for everything but you're,0.061316628
like well are you stupid or you're just naive or or what is it you,0.5036303
know and so when the movie took that left turn and went from a satirical,0.08277811
dark comedy to basically a horror movie with very little gore but still is very,0.16465357
tension kind of shocking as to what happened I stopped rooting for the funny conman,0.21050268
family you know and stopped feeling bad and then stopped feeling bad for the rich,0.028431945
folks we're getting taken advantage of and I liked how the movie didn't let me,0.022187201
say okay these people are bad these people are good that's all there is to,0.19795932
it I like how it didn't do that everything was great funny at first and,0.04473227
then kind of terrifying at the end and then kind of shocking at the near,0.10258595
near the end credits but it's a it's a very well-done movie I can't say,0.018953077
that I wasn't I was looking forward to it and I I wasn't in any,0.03390574
way anticipating what was happening in the movie I couldn't call out anything I wasn't,0.024382306
alike okay well this is happening so that that's gonna happen later I got everything,0.07568992
wrong I got everything wrong in this movie and I loved it I loved that,0.08266038
I got everything wrong about it and it's two families the rich family and poor,0.15112174
family both mother-daughter father-son so it's four people to each family right and so the,0.12805916
rich family obviously they live in this huge house you know gated security all kinds,0.18081953
of crap and I would explain the poor family's living situation but I liked how,0.5247735
both of their the character flaws are highlighted in this movie to show their downfall,0.04322097
right because the the pork family their character flaws they wind up really screwing them,0.32550433
over later on at the end of the movie which was I thought was brilliant,0.06615783
because it wasn't something that I paid attention to and I would never have guessed,0.027399579
it but the character flaw just came back in a huge way at the end,0.042746697
of the movie and completely ruined them and then same thing with the rich family,0.10662894
their character flaws screwed them over kind of in a worse way you know towards,0.25214902
the end of the movie and I really I really loved that like I said,0.038665794
before when I reviewed Joker I hadn't seen this movie at the time but this,0.028798461
has to be also one of the best movies I've seen all year long really,0.012418314
is it really is I couldn't find it in the theater anywhere near me so,0.030854544
I did find the UH the illegal means online so if it comes out on,0.022760589

highly recommend you check it out you watch it in the sense that it makes,0.031940125
you think about the state of society nowadays and between the rich and the poor,0.19814025
it's very much like Joker except that it focuses more on the wealth inequality gap,0.02761643
whereas Joker was mainly about mental illness but towards the end of the movie I,0.09753654
was like wow this is practically like Joker in so many ways now that I,0.06361484
see this ending I was like okay that's that's kind of disturbing but it was,0.07649745

want to give away anymore spoilers I don't think I gave it away any spoilers,0.047937788
but I don't want to give away too much about the movie it is funny,0.045730047
it's darkly funny it's very good dark humor in here it does become quite tense,0.026085177
when that movie makes that left turn turns it to like a horror suspense thriller,0.047002543
thing the move the ending is fantastic the cast all do great work it shot,0.36402595
