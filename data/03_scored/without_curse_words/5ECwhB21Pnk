i don't know how you make a movie as bad as the last jedi it,0.18269749
takes one of the most beloved franchises of all time throws it in the trunk,0.16207683
of a car and then backs it into a river i'll probably keep going to,0.06975503
see these movies just because it's interesting to see how much money you can spend,0.12939186
setting a dumpster on fire but i definitely have no emotional investment in this terrible,0.34440067
fan fiction written by a gang of idiot children this movie fails on so many,0.9325028
levels that i don't even know if i can cover all of them in one,0.1793966
video but i'll try and real quick before any of you complain that this movie,0.113789804
came out six months ago you just got done celebrating a star wars holiday so,0.10633219
don't tell me that this isn't relevant this is a detailed analysis and i had,0.056261912
to wait for the freaking thing to come out on blu-ray so i could actually,0.55473703
pull the scenes and show you just how bad they are so yeah let's just,0.4251989
get into it number one mad libs are not good storytelling now any modern star,0.39498675
wars movie is gonna look good i mean they're sinking millions of disney dollars into,0.19064656
the special effects so the problem is not that there's not enough lasers or spaceships,0.07027987
or explosions the problem with the last jedi is that it's a narrative cluster with,0.09703746
a bunch of characters whose actions only make sense if you assume that they were,0.12785508
the type of kids who had to wear a helmet to gym class now the,0.11463561
force awakens was really bad but at least it kind of set up for another,0.103899576
movie that could have been good if the first movie is the stupid goofy action,0.8060606
adventure the second movie is the chance to start really defining your characters show us,0.047533944
that rey has some sort of weakness or trial to overcome and that this trilogy,0.11904468
is more than just the mary sue space chronicles how did you do that i,0.1097975
don't know no one treats ships but i've never left show us that finn is,0.08373271
a hero and not just a vehicle for bad jokes i'm in charge i'm in,0.14371812
charge now phasma i'm in charge bring it down and show us how our favorite,0.27523708
characters from the old movies have changed and evolved in meaningful ways but here's the,0.030107966
thing about trying to evolve your characters you should probably have some sort of plan,0.07511373
and no not a super secret plan that you don't tell anyone else about see,0.13824613
i made the mistake of assuming that jj abrams had some sort of spreadsheet somewhere,0.13621223
that said look here's who this guy is here's why she has these powers here's,0.19841833
why luke skywalker's rotten away on an island that's why i honestly did not believe,0.25424457
it when they said no ryan johnson had complete creative control to do whatever the,0.0544941
he wanted it's not true that's impossible jj wrote drafts for eight and nine then,0.08020746
ryan arrived and rewrote the last jedi entirely ryan didn't keep anything from the first,0.059658244
draft of the episode eight script so basically jj abrams invented all these characters and,0.08655579
set up all these plot threads and then told ryan johnson i don't care do,0.11532559
whatever you want they basically played star wars mad libs give me the name of,0.27978235
a character uh snoke all right now give me some adjectives uh pointless irrelevant insignificant,0.5154597
i'm sorry man but if you're gonna write an epic story that unfolds over three,0.15159445
movies you need to plan out an arc where are these characters going to begin,0.08376441
where are they going to go to and where will they end up for instance,0.08360557
in the force awakens finn's character arc starts the moment he rejects the first order,0.04602443
specifically represented in the story by the character of captain phasma and he gave you,0.06505041
permission to remove that helmet i'm sorry i can't phasma is the catalyst for finn's,0.31067207
entire character and she should be treated as more than just a random bad guy,0.28761598
if i was planning out a proper character arc i would probably revise this scene,0.07808656
where finn fights a random guy with a laser stick to flesh out the character,0.44754905
we've been selling action figures of for over a year as the first battle between,0.05281781
finn and phasma we would see the difference in their power levels finn is a,0.16037323
random grunt storm trooper with only the most basic of training whereas captain phasma is,0.2436864
a battle-hardened warrior in this first battle she will completely kick his ass and he,0.93232936
will barely escape with his life then in the second movie we will have another,0.091043785
battle between these two to show how finn has grown we will see that he,0.063246116
is no longer a scared coward but has trained himself to be a formidable opponent,0.5839665
we will see that phasma's arrogance has caused her to become complacent and she will,0.4912916
be shocked to discover that her former underling can now battle her to a standstill,0.078360215
then in the third movie it all comes full circle in the final battle we,0.062469073
see that finn has reached the apex of his training he has become a masterful,0.14047891
warrior maybe he has force powers whatever whereas phasma's hate caused her to grow stagnant,0.34172818
and weak finn's virtue is what gave him the strength to fulfill his destiny he,0.24236149
will defeat phasma on the battlefield showing that good triumphs over evil and completing his,0.35996827
hero's journey but instead because we have no plan for either character this is the,0.04379679
arc first movie finn throws phasma in a trash compactor what do we do with,0.5536162
her trash compactor second movie finn hits phasma upside the head with a lightsaber and,0.8139828
maybe she dies i don't know third movie she's maybe gonna come back and if,0.5203337
she does come back i can only assume that finn is gonna whoop her ass,0.932729
a third time then ride her around the death star like a horse this lack,0.44653502
of planning is without a doubt the biggest problem with the new star wars trilogy,0.10403151
however some idiots are saying it's actually good because it subverts our expectations so yeah,0.8606264
after this movie came out a bunch of people who thought they were much smarter,0.3646119
than they actually are wrote a bunch of articles about how the movie is good,0.1702074
because it subverts our expectations which is a stupid way of saying it's unpredictable motherf,0.8606264
if you really wanted to you could make a star wars movie that ends with,0.18282919
jar jar binks checking off on han solo's grave just because a movie is unpredictable,0.23943596
doesn't make it good when your movie is constantly throwing curveballs at the audience it,0.15826088
becomes a disorienting mess let's count em out one in a highly dramatic moment rey,0.2957926
finds luke and gives him his lightsaber but gotcha luke doesn't give a and chucks,0.3714452
it off a cliff number two a tie fighter destroys leia's ship leaving her to,0.38665822
die in space but gotcha she has floaty force powers so she doesn't die number,0.48782295
three finn and rose have to find the master code breaker no other person in,0.08085836
the galaxy could possibly handle disabling the hyper speed tracker but gotcha turns out this,0.07793245
random act just happens to be capable of doing the exact same number four so,0.067398235
they go with the tweaker dude to shut down the hyperspace tracker but gotcha it's,0.13158022
a trap number five holdo is an incapable commander who is going to get everybody,0.4532231
killed but gotcha she's actually got a super cool secret plan number six snoke is,0.5458395
an amazing and important jedi master gotcha he's just a guy and now he's dead,0.69542736
it doesn't matter number seven rey's parents oh my god we have to find out,0.08649882
who's raping no gotcha they're just they're nobody it doesn't matter number eight finn's gonna,0.72096145
die no gotcha number nine luke fights kylo ren to the death but gotcha it,0.49115515
was a force project he was a magic ghost but gotcha he dies anyway and,0.3542109
double gotcha here's the thing the i am your father reveal from empire is so,0.086284116
great because it's completely unexpected but the last jedi has so many plot twists that,0.056430645
you stop being surprised by them and just start getting annoyed if you actually think,0.19118133
it's brilliant that this movie plays out like an episode of candid camera then i'm,0.11790405
sorry you're an idiot number three believe women this purple-haired lady is holdo who looks,0.93276644
like she's about to hold an intersectional lecture on modern afrocentric feminism rather than command,0.4461906
a fleet of rebel soldiers but leia gets knocked out so the liberal arts major,0.13961527
is up to bat now real quick i want to make it clear that this,0.18054257
is not an attack on diversity space is a real big place and it makes,0.10868476
sense that it's populated by more than just weirdo aliens a bunch of white people,0.6544733
and one black guy that being said ryan johnson's attempt to inject feminism into star,0.53378284
wars has backfired horribly and here's why now first of all this character obviously should,0.23969576
have been admiral akbar or mon mothma or someone the audience actually has an emotional,0.11643395
connection to but okay we're stuck with the lesbian bookstore owner the real problem however,0.7115988
is holdo's bafflingly idiotic decision to have a special secret plan for no reason whatsoever,0.8544818
tell us that we have a plan even when poe threatens mutiny and takes holdo,0.14151692
prisoner all she says is uh well okay not much i can do about that,0.29313275
guess you're in charge now popo no all she needs to do in that moment,0.3823316
is say to po listen motherfu let's sit on down we'll have some green milk,0.69542736
and i will tell you about the secret plan so you stop trying to commit,0.25148168
high treason now here's the thing what is the moral of the flawed interactions between,0.15814549
holdo and poe the most obvious moral is to be subservient to authority and blindly,0.4033615
trust your superiors now i don't know about you but that sounds like something the,0.20902859
bad guys would say i wonder if a bunch of people just carrying out orders,0.31089434
ever resulted in something bad oh yeah however the real moral is the ultimate exercise,0.22071497
in jamming politically correct politics into a kid's movie with all the subtle nuance of,0.15322806
a bad guy literally named general grievous see poe thinks he's a better leader than,0.3792638
holdo because he's a man so he starts mansplaining look at this mansplaining such a,0.36883768
mansplainer but what he really should have done is trust women you know no matter,0.61516964
what it doesn't matter what the situation even if it seems like that particular woman,0.31089434
is about to get you and everyone you love incinerated by a million lasers just,0.3515983
trust her she knows what's best she is living her truth hashtag me too hashtag,0.21497393
time's up in summary an assortment of differently colored people holding hands under a rainbow,0.44577613
awesome i'm totally down with that everybody getting killed because they didn't trust women enough,0.72759324
jesus christ number four hyperspace is broken all right so star wars is a shared,0.31089434
universe right there's books graphic novels video games all sorts of so when you're contributing,0.0862746
to a shared universe you have to be really careful about changing the rules of,0.044439442
that universe because it changes it for everything the victorians are a microscopic life form,0.29970893
that resides within all living cells if you tell me that spider-man is a transsexual,0.8236489
werewolf all the spider-man now has to deal with your horrible creative decision with that,0.43076336
in mind let's talk about how ryan johnson has the concept of hyperspace forever hyperspace,0.124145046
used to be a pretty simple concept your ship isn't just traveling really fast because,0.14377181
then you would smash into planets with the force of a nuclear bomb no you,0.6050151
enter like a different dimension and then pop out a wormhole somewhere else but ryan,0.15379027
johnson believes that hyperspace is just going really fast so fast that a mid-sized cruiser,0.08820051
traveling at hyperspace can apparently destroy not only the flagship of the first order but,0.11864876
like a couple star destroyers as well what the now i don't read star wars,0.15111102
books but as far as i can tell hyperspace has been around for like tens,0.089941435
of thousands of years and if you know anything about technology in the real world,0.10929198
every time we invent something the military tries to figure out whether or not it,0.05909925
can be used as a weapon so you're telling me that this purple-haired lady is,0.15488063
the first person to recognize that you can just launch a ship at hyperspace and,0.10271331
basically kill anything if that's the case everybody should just immediately start building empty ships,0.7696476
and then just launch the ships at each other like missiles and again this ruins,0.39258987
the shared universe of star wars because any time from now on that there is,0.09542497
a big epic space battle i'm gonna be sitting there going uh why don't you,0.18382066
just hyperspace like one of your ships at the i mean this ship's about to,0.15066437
get blown up anyway might as well just hyper space it at them come up,0.4626285
with some other way that this happens if you told me that it was like,0.048857514
a suicide run and she had to get nose to nose with the first orders,0.4561285
battleship in order for this to work i'd be like okay at least it's like,0.101102315
a super risky maneuver you can't just be like a mile away and go all,0.15534046
right hyperspace button boom solved not to mention man i know it's supposed to be,0.09768041
sad that the purple haired lady died but i don't care this character was dumb,0.80856514
i'm glad she did one useful thing before she died number five spinny death stick,0.5384327
man this fight scene is terrible it's hard to follow it's messy and they didn't,0.15056998
even take the time to nail the choreography watch this guy okay not only is,0.18502676
there no tactical reason to be spinning around in a sword fight unless you really,0.17006196
want your opponent to see your back so they can stab you in it but,0.7680914
okay this guy spins around and he's coming in at the death angle all he,0.6549072
has to do is follow through on the swing and rey will die right here,0.4625795
daisy ridley is supposed to already be ducking but because she missed her cue he,0.35347855
changes the trajectory he's like oh i'm gonna hit her uh over the head no,0.68399036
one will notice it's so obvious he's the one closest to the camera and i,0.14873946
get that they wanted to do it as one big shot without any cuts or,0.36641926
close-ups but oh it's real bad you can look at the monitor while you're filming,0.14979875
and be like this isn't gonna work we need to revise this goofy spin around,0.53490317
missed the girl by a million miles guy is not a dynamic character number six,0.21170734
stop trying to be marvel this movie needed to stop making so many stupid jokes,0.8355208
i mean come on don't take the epic climax of the last movie and turn,0.1522895
it into a goof oh look he doesn't even want the lightsaber he threw it,0.5009939
off a cliff that's hilarious oh man how about some of your mom jokes leia,0.7093121
has an urgent message for him about his mother ha ha here's the thing they,0.14935113
want the movies to be fun and jokey because that's what the marvel movies do,0.14438298
and they're really popular but the marvel movies do that because superheroes are already a,0.04674701
ridiculous concept you know grown men and women wearing ridiculous costumes beating the crap out,0.81107086
of each other first time all of us were in our suits and and none,0.10542099
of us could get over this wall occasionally you can get away with making a,0.08642077
completely serious superhero movie but it's easier to just make a bunch of jokes and,0.06933927
admit that the whole superhero thing is dumb but there's nothing inherently dumb about star,0.64619833
wars it's just a space epic with people flying spaceships and hitting each other with,0.5288746
laser swords the audience isn't going into it being like this is ridiculous and stupid,0.800887
and you need to write a bunch of jokes so they know not to take,0.21855427
the movie too seriously i don't know i want to take star wars seriously i,0.16715916
want an epic adventure like the original star wars movies i didn't buy a ticket,0.09852759
to see a bunch of wacky antics do you have something a cow or something,0.7449314
you can put on number seven rose sucks i hate to on all the lady,0.92385197
characters in this movie but man rose is just terrible i'll say this whoever plays,0.29193965
her seems like a very nice lady and someone who deserves a much better script,0.31089434
than the one she was handed for most of the movies she's just kind of,0.05595196
an annoying idealistic idiot who keeps dropping cartoon morals about how saving animals is good,0.93232936
and slavery is bad there's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this,0.27111664
rich you know real deep themes but then we get to the epic scene with,0.064540185
the batarang ram laser probably the coolest looking scene in the whole movie and finn,0.27398837
is about to go randy quaid not crazy but i mean like an independence day,0.35976666
and smash into the death laser sacrificing himself to save everybody i was blown away,0.7305216
i was like wow ryan johnson has some balls it was actually the first time,0.7093121
i felt any emotion watching any of these movies but then in the back of,0.113558136
my head i'm like what's what's the trick there's going to be a trick it's,0.117257826
ryan johnson he keeps doing it what's the bam the dummy lady just smashes right,0.622182
into a spaceship she's like what's gonna save us is love and i'm like what,0.19141354
what is this dumb talking about and the laser's about to kill everybody whatever is,0.8787269
left of the resistance you have put at they're gonna die because of you because,0.5876557
of you everyone is dead the scene isn't sentimental or cute this is a war,0.40338287
zone and remember this is the same girl who zapped to finn with a taser,0.2611702
because he was about to abandon his duty to the resistance her sister gave her,0.28834364
life in service of the resistance and now suddenly she's like you know what loyalty,0.15610124
to your comrades is irrelevant it's all about love baby as much as i hate,0.4100913
to say it let the black guy die for all the talk of subverting our,0.8589115
expectations that would have actually been a radical creative decision i would respect number eight,0.09580564
go re-watch empire now most star wars fans will tell you that empire strikes back,0.18897353
as their favorite one because it's dark and weird it doesn't have a happy ending,0.14166874
it ends with the characters basically completely han solo's a brick luke's hand got cut,0.08222477
off the worst bad guy in the whole thing turns out to be everybody's dad,0.4721214
this is a perfect place for the second movie in your trilogy to go the,0.16077854
heroes have reached their lowest point and must now battle their way back up it's,0.1377279
interesting that's what i thought was happening in the last jedi but i don't know,0.083445705
what's going on now didn't everybody die didn't the entire resistance get reduced to like,0.14309439
12 people aboard the millennium falcon so why is everybody smiling and patting each other,0.13423602
on the back all your friends are dead i know you're all excited that you,0.74490696
inspired eight-year-old boys around the universe but come on this should be the shot at,0.37620556
the end of the movie everybody watching as the millennium falcon takes off and wondering,0.091392405
if rey's new rock moving powers are really going to be enough to save the,0.047824726
day the emotional tone of this ending makes absolutely no sense stop smiling stop hugging,0.16651827
you're number nine all of your heroes are dead i don't understand the point of,0.43772593
bringing back all our favorite characters and showing us that they're sad old failures who,0.37079108
asked for this let me be very clear this character is not luke skywalker even,0.09708928
mark hamill knows that this character is not luke skywalker and was trying to tell,0.105915375
people about that until disney told him to shut his mouth who is this guy,0.6364068
how did the most optimistic hopeful character in the galaxy turn into this hermit that's,0.05732224
not what a jedi does i mean a jedi is optimistic and jodah is has,0.1670462
tenacity he never gives up luke skywalker is supposed to represent hope remember the name,0.056437217
of that star wars movie a new hope that was referring to luke hope is,0.08714663
an emotion about optimism positivity not giving up even when it seems like all is,0.074742556
lost not bro i'm an old man and everything sucks now it would be one,0.69542736
thing if he started off the movie like an angry old man and then slowly,0.49106595
rediscovered hope and returned to his old ways but that never happens at the end,0.1465605
of return of the jedi we see the real luke skywalker he's hanging out with,0.16372155
ewoks having a good time with his buddies says goodbye to his two dads and,0.103720374
kermit the frog or whatever that's luke skywalker smiling having a good time full of,0.1744607
hope after this moment we never see the real luke skywalker again remember that even,0.06520523
when luke confronted his father who was the most evil guy ever just just pure,0.5154597
evil he still had that hope he went listen dad i know there is good,0.39073747
in you the emperor hasn't driven it from you fully that's the essence of luke's,0.08497466
character and yet when he faces kylo ren he basically tells him you there's no,0.102046415
hope for you you lose you suck he taunts him as a failure he humiliates,0.9005475
him see you around kid it's the complete opposite of what luke skywalker is this,0.26074222
is the moment that he should reaffirm everything he's about say what he said to,0.08603052
his father i know that there's good in you i have hope for you but,0.10700942
no instead he's just a cocky arrogant brushes off his shoulder dies on a rock,0.8328623
and that's it this horrible old man who was pretending to be luke skywalker is,0.5612086
dead who cares number 10 to live and die in disney here's the thing i'm,0.6051264
not broken up that star wars sucks now whereas once it was the unique vision,0.49675536
of a driven young director it is now the property of a publicly traded company,0.056230143
mostly concerned with how many toys they can sell use the force link to activate,0.06129875
real movie phrases the darkness guides me which again is fine everybody loves toys i'm,0.1410502
just not sure that obsession with generating obscene amounts of money is ever gonna lead,0.17061457
us to another great star wars film the fact that they're pumping out one of,0.15975216
these movies every year feels almost exploitative what would the last jedi have been like,0.12018391
if there was another year to write a decent script or take some time to,0.0336356
really plan out the characters sadly we'll never know this is the movie we got,0.049805555
