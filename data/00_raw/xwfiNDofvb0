so we're just gonna roll the dice on this what do you say pal yo this is so tough i i just told you that list listen i'm from the future how dare you point at me you you were pointing they doing a boy first let me start by saying don't forget to like comment and subscribe if you are subscribed hit the notification this was better than i ever expected i mean they took a bunch of care and detail they placed into this movie i mean so let's start at the beginning right so when we first see miles and his family i'm like oh yeah that's a black dad yeah that's hispanic mama yeah that's new york like the the ambiance and everything as the father's driving him you just hear some spanish music in the background it's hustle and bustle you see this new [ __ ] gentrifying ass shop um what was it like phone party or some [ __ ] like that like you just see all this dopeness but they wasn't putting a bunch on it right it just seemed natural and towards the end of this film at no point this is what was dope about it at no point did i even take into account yo he's black and he's hispanic until it got to the end and i went this is some of the best representation modern representation i've ever seen portrayed just period and for it to be in a cgi ass cartoon ass marvel movie is like yo there was no patronizing at no point did i even consider what kelly was and who he is plays a place in the film it's not just there just randomly right even gwen her being a spider spider woman or whatever it may it made sense right this was dope in the beginning he's talking to people he talking to his boys and [ __ ] as he walking down the block and you like yo that's what somebody would say like so from then on at no other point was i going oh that's what they say now i'm fully involved into it now i'm in this world and it seems real and he speaks how a young black kid would speak from new york his pops and his uncle like his uncle seemed like a uncle down now how he was dressed down to how he acted like down to how his house look he looked like a bachelor ass uncle right man this was so dope the way his mom she would speak spanish randomly to him and [ __ ] like man it was dope then he goes to uh he goes to a tech uh high school or whatever and it's like that's dope like some of the most famous new yorkers that that we see nowadays they've gone to schools like that where it's like this multicultural uh place and it's like it's asians blacks white people and they all together and that these parents send their kids there and it literally sets them off on a dope path right so his mom is a nurse his pops is a uh i think she's a nurse she could be a doctor the the pops is a cop and they they strive to like get him into a better place and the pops told him like hey man you the choices everybody has choices and he's like well what if i choose not to go he's like no no you got to go right that's how it is it's like he he wants him to do better and be better and i just thought from the beginning from the very start of this it laid the groundwork of who miles morales is what his family is what he came from let's get into this artwork yo the colors mixing the comic aspect into it and doing it in such a dope way it didn't sacrifice anything by doing it when onomatopoeia was involved when thought bubbles were involved where um the coloring would change based off of the fight sequences it all made sense and it wasn't there was no sacrifice in doing that um the physics oh right so they could have just gone away and played it straight let's keep this as real as possible but based on what this was and what they were trying to convey the physics was just fire er i maybe in the next film and i it based off that the ending it seems there's gonna be a next film they're gonna go even more big but uh until we got to that last part a lot of the fighting was it seemed very closed in which was dope right because like it wasn't this spread out thing even when they're running from doc ock and they're going through the forest it wasn't this wide open area right or even when they were fighting against her inside the building it's this closed-in sort of fight and i was like and then one of the dopest scenes of the past however many years for me as far as action goes is uh when prowler and uh the scorpion and the other dude they're inside aunt may's house and they're fighting and they told him hey can y'all take this [ __ ] outside you're gonna [ __ ] my house up and they tear the house up but the fighting it was so dope i mean in this close little area so much was going on it was like i would have to watch it multiple times to catch everything that was taking place because it was all happening at once like some they're like this is an aspect of like oh like some of these classic kung fu films where they're able to do things at one time that it it just it plays with your brain right but you can see the things that they want you to pay attention to you pay attention to so well while he has the goober and he's trying to escape whatever power's chasing him there's still [ __ ] going off on the side and then every once in a while something would come in and uh like spider girl spider woman whatever she comes she snatches the goober in it all that was dope the story line with his uncle that was dope i don't know how in my i don't know why i couldn't figure out who the prowler was and when uh when he started talking i'm like wait he has a black voice i still didn't get who the [ __ ] the problem was but yeah man i still didn't get who the problem was this was so good um i should have been able to pick that up though even down to the spider that bit him the colors on it were like it was very colorful but it wasn't too bright i can't really explain that this wasn't a very bright move film but the it had so many vivid colors that it was like oh did they they did it they did it right because this could have been a shock to the system if it's too bright get like because it looks like a kaleidoscope when he's doing this little inter-dimensional breakdown or whatever it was done perfect um the voice acting this some dope ass voice acting every and everything they were saying it sounded so real and so sincere and i really appreciated that even down to like how gwen was talking to him uh uh peter b parker everything uh aunt may i liked that i enjoyed this aunt may man it was and it was a bunch of things that was dope to see right so i've been out of comics for a while but it was dope to see all the spider suits in the basement or whatever in the little layer or whatever um and then let's get to the dopest part of the film all the different spider-man we got gwen we got peter porker peter b parker spider-man noir which was fire i i want to see them do like little mini like let's say the next film comes out let's do like some little mini uh shows or whatever that like make it a mini series and each episode is uh like some little issue that they're dealing with and it all leads up to this to that to that film that would be so fire because i'm interested i'm even interested in peter porker i i found that amusing that when i first saw him i go yo is this even legal like that's clearly a rip-off of of porky pig and like he has these like acme tools he has a a mallet he has the um anvil and it's like for them to acknowledge that at the end that was fire um man storyline was just dope man like i i had no problems with it right i'm not expecting nothing too crazy but for as far as the origin story fire and based off what they showed at the ending with uh uh that uh other spider-man going to earth 67 yo we in for some fly [ __ ] right man this is for me for me this is my favorite off the first watch my favorite cgi thing i've seen i don't really enjoy those type of movies right like i was even thinking to myself am i going to watch seoul when it comes out this month i'm probably going to end up watching that but that's probably a little played into a little bit why i didn't watch this until so much so much further but man this was good this was good um i want to know how they're going to take this though because this is so um cool and they could have made it cool how can i put this to the point where it was cheesy but they understood what people would want to see so to see peter parker peter b parker see mj again and be like you know awestruck or whatever you're like oh that was you know what i mean or to see like for for me right i don't read the comments i don't know if this is this way in this comics to see doc och reveal this doc ock it never even crossed my mind that she was doc i'm like oh that's tough right because my whole life has been some old white guy with the glasses and [ __ ] only thing they changed was her sex it's an old white chick with glasses man dope they they knew what they were doing on this the people who worked on this understood the material and you could tell and they loved it and [ __ ] with it and they understood what they were trying to convey and i got it this was fire hey this actually makes me want to start watching some more like comic uh like bass movies and [ __ ] like the uh rise of the superman i plan on watching that maybe um they uh the and the x-men anime with the wolverine anime that's coming on netflix soon i haven't watched that so i may end up watching that too but yeah this was dope next movie you
