hello everyone today i'll be reviewing the philadelphia story so the philadelphia story came out,0.060710616
in 1940 and was directed by george cucor and this stars catherine hepburn cary grant,0.097021915
and james stewart right at the start of this film we see cary grant and,0.07315198
catherine hepburn are a married couple who are actually just about to break up and,0.07980126
then suddenly the film fast forwards two years later where we see catherine hepburn is,0.028012589
arranged to be married to another man a rather rich man in fact however carrie,0.34691507
grant's character he is very much still in love with catherine hepburn's character tracy it's,0.12730162
very obvious and then we're later introduced to james stewart's character called mike and also,0.07093687
this other character called liz and mike and liz are photographers and they are arranged,0.08015604
to go and go and see and photograph tracy's wedding so this film is one,0.17231159
of those classic comedies of the 1930s 1940s and a very innocent type of film,0.11601222
very light-hearted and what i really like about this film is the dialogue because the,0.0561588
dialogue is very interesting in this film all of the characters whenever they're speaking they,0.048646804
are very witty and everything they're saying is very interesting and they actually do tend,0.042679187
to talk quite quickly in this film and this film never really stops when it,0.09313291
comes to the characters talking and everybody takes a break now some people might not,0.10052032
like that and i think particularly with modern audiences watching this film it can seem,0.087232284
that the characters talk perhaps a bit too much and maybe say quite a lot,0.08389709
and maybe maybe just talk and talk and talk and never really stop and in,0.10491697
some ways that is true however everything that these characters say is does come across,0.061764915
as very intelligent on screen and very witty and just the the way these characters,0.08069678
communicate with each other the chemistry that i have on screen catherine hepburn is particularly,0.10339815
impressive in this films gives a fantastic performance and so does james stewart as well,0.074371
in fact james stewart actually won the oscar for best actor for this film and,0.08598102
he really gives a a very impressive and unique performance in this film we don't,0.07543334
normally think of james stewart as being an actor who woos the ladies but in,0.25007492
this film he really comes across in that way as opposed to the sort of,0.24908909
honest nice guy that he is in other films although he still is a very,0.1919515
likable character in this film some people actually think that james stewart won the oscar,0.10926422
for this film as consolation for not winning it for mr smith goes to washington,0.13990834
which came out the previous year but really what the song focuses on is catherine,0.057606377
hepburn she's the main star and there's three men in this film who essentially have,0.15258634
affection for catherine hepburn's character tracy or almost seem to fall in love with her,0.15131561
so i've got cary grant james stewart and also catherine hepburn's future husband or the,0.08133343
man she is hoping to marry in this film draws kitterage and these three men,0.15200134
are very different characters but they all have something different to say and something different,0.031205699
to put on screen and and all have a different input to this film this,0.05757917
is one of those films that really doesn't take itself too seriously there aren't really,0.1025569
any dark or evil moments in this film which is something i like however some,0.242626
people might find this film lacks a bit of energy or maybe doesn't have many,0.11719982
interesting scenes in it but if you view this as a romantic comedy then it,0.16658223
really does the job extremely well everything about this film says romantic comedy just the,0.09375183
way that these characters are talking all the scenes and although obviously this film came,0.049321786
out in 1940 so it won't be as risque in terms of the sexual or,0.54059225
nudity or things like that obviously there's none of that here but it is often,0.2398105
quite suggestive in quite a few scenes with the innuendos which is very cleverly done,0.11799952
especially in films of this era but obviously it doesn't show too much on screen,0.0769916
there are a few scenes or perhaps it's it slightly makes reference to something which,0.05568205
is all very cleverly done so this was the second time that i'd seen this,0.08498828
film and i think i liked it quite a bit more this time than i,0.107180424
did the first time and it was it was interesting how watching for a second,0.053895377
time there were some bits i remembered in certain bits i didn't however this time,0.104486704
i did spend much more time listening to the dialogue and i think the first,0.04809371
time i watched it i found the dialogue a bit annoying this time i really,0.11638454
appreciate it i really appreciated all these different lines that these characters have all these,0.04103622
different character moments especially with james stewart's character but really catherine hepburn um is the,0.032698456
main star and we get a few scenes where she plays her character slightly different,0.06318521
because she's a very rich wealthy character and she tries to come across as slightly,0.23643735
different in a few scenes which is quite amusing particularly with the photographers when she's,0.13687928
first meeting them she's trying to come across as something a bit different and then,0.15452152
we have these other these other two characters known as papa and uncle willie and,0.07748366
their identities get switched round and that's a very funny scene as well we also,0.084732085
have a younger girl called diner in this and she is very good as well,0.1565992
overall i think the philadelphia story is a decent romantic comedy unfortunately it's not going,0.086918026
to appeal to everyone especially with the dialogue the way the characters speak in this,0.027152255
film i've read some other reviews some people might get slightly annoyed by a dialogue,0.09156788
in this film and feel like their characters talk too much i can see that,0.07928702
but i personally don't really agree i think it's an enjoyable film i don't necessarily,0.083334036
think it's one of the best romantic comedies of all time but i can certainly,0.05971838
see why it is regarded as a classic particularly with stars like catherine hepburn cary,0.11242502
grant and james stewart all in one film together and i personally did find the,0.05773639
ending to be a little bit tacky a little bit cheesy but at the same,0.2679742
time it was believable so i can forgive it for that and i suppose in,0.0685943
these type of films you want to have an ending like this if the ending,0.31089434
was different i i don't know how i would end the film otherwise come to,0.08438141
think of it so overall a very enjoyable film if you like romantic comedies um,0.31089434
especially classic ones in this era then this is probably one of the best ones,0.08129229
to watch so i'm gonna give the philadelphia story a rating of eight out of,0.096380815
ten it's an excellent romantic comedy however i myself i don't always enjoy romantic comedies,0.2681989
that much so that's probably why i haven't rated it higher so there we go,0.07431813
so that is my review of the philadelphia story so what do you guys think,0.062154792
