I wasn't sure if I was gonna make it in time to see this movie,0.03750372
because the AMC near me didn't have it anymore the Regal didn't have it so,0.046701215
I thought you know what I'm gonna have to probably just wait until it's on,0.03169467
streaming but thanks to smaller theatres like AFI I was able to catch this one,0.04357485
just in time the farewell is written and directed by Lulu Wang and stars aquafina,0.020032005
as Billy Billy has just learned that her grandma is dying and her family is,0.15846604
gonna go visit her but they don't want to tell her grandma that she's dying,0.24492717
so they make up an excuse that there's a wedding happening in the family so,0.026459675
that everybody can come together and see her one last time two things interested me,0.08014465
about this movie one the premise and to seeing Aquafina in a more serious role,0.03447048
because usually she does more over-the-top comedic roles and I think it was definitely interesting,0.025280304
to see her do something different overall I would say the Ferrell was a great,0.05100495
time there was great performances beautiful cinematography and really good balance between comedy and drama,0.037988637
so let's get into it so it worked first and foremost this movie looked great,0.04386088
from the cinematography to the locations I think somebody's just very visually appealing they shot,0.1664968
it on location in China and New York so you get a lot of great,0.04932869
cityscapes another thing that really stood out to me where the performances in this movie,0.018208737
especially Aquafina I think she really carried this movie again we're not used to seeing,0.061006654
her in serious roles so I think this is really refreshing and I think she,0.060552333
killed it she did great playing this granddaughter who had to act like everything was,0.5233187
okay but really it was it because she along with her family were the only,0.07588681
ones that really knew what was going on while her grandma was just kind of,0.051795855
going on about you know having time of her life as if life goes on,0.12260997
because again she doesn't know so I think that balance was really interesting that dynamic,0.052080553
and seeing how everybody's being affected by this tragedy or potential tragedy in their family,0.014903439
speaking of which the grandma played by a xu xin zhao i hope i'm pronouncing,0.03958907
her name correctly was also amazing her dynamic with awkwafina's character billy was really what,0.019811165
drove this movie she was very energetic she was very funny and I think it,0.075250894
made even more tragic to see her going about her life but then we the,0.058403123
audience and the family know that her time is running short also I think this,0.021671018
movie was generally funny even though the subject the premise is kind of sad and,0.028118644
dark I think they did manage to find some nice moments to have some comedy,0.07507928
between the family members seeing them play off of each other I think that really,0.042173974
made this movie entertaining and it really made me fall in love with these characters,0.060334153
but what I think worked the most for me and this would be what I,0.035442315
think really sold it was how they explored the ethics of the situation and seeing,0.029836813
them go back and forth arguing whether they're right or wrong to not tell her,0.04494313
grandma that she's dying and they mentioned in the movie like in America this wouldn't,0.09278647
fly they would definitely make them tell or the doctor would be obligated to tell,0.020981887
the grandma yes you have cancer you're dying but in China they believe no you,0.39954823
should let these people live the rest of their lives happy and not till the,0.2648855
very last minute that they should tell her the truth and so seeing this back,0.020045975
and forth between the family members I think really kept me intrigued seeing their different,0.020888098
perspectives there's also an interesting discussion about immigration in this movie where there's two sides,0.027822636
of the family there are people that stayed in China and those who left to,0.029786259
find better jobs better education for their children better opportunity and we see a clash,0.06020178
between these two sides and they're kind of arguing on who made the right call,0.02099253
who's really doing what's best for their family in the family as a whole and,0.03442658
I thought that was a really interesting conflict they added to this movie the only,0.07907038
thing I can think of that could have been done a little bit better in,0.030102886
this movie was the ending now there is a part where they do wrap up,0.04777881
the story with the grandma well and I think they did a great job of,0.03371949
wrapping up things with the family but then there's one scene in towards the end,0.041125644
where it kind of just ends and then there's something in the credits and then,0.036244527
you're like okay I get it now but I think they definitely could have done,0.08864637
something within that scene to really tie everything together and really wrap it up but,0.046547554
otherwise I think this was a great movie the verdict I think this movie was,0.05161426
a good time The Farewell offers great performances beautiful scenery cinematography it also has a,0.029470962
lot of great messages about ethics and teaches a lot about Chinese culture so I,0.035126355
think there's a lot to get from this movie and it's definitely worth seeing in,0.027896471
theaters but if you don't catch as theaters of course you can always try and,0.018134901
find out in streaming or just go buy the DVD so have you seen the,0.087208234
