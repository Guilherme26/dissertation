hello guys hope you're going well,0.082403585
so roma roma roma today we are talking about the Netflix distributed black and white Mexican film which has floored movie lovers and critics and is already gathering so much Oscar but Roma is written directed and photographed by Mexican filmmaker Alphonso Quran and he is the man behind giant blockbuster films like gravity like one of the Harry Potter movies and my all-time favorite children of men oh my goodness,0.08208605
but in this film things get very personal,0.10313928
you know this is a stripped back art film black and white art film that is rooted deeply rooted in currents on childhood yet in 1971 in currents a very own childhood town of Roma the film follows Clio a woman who was a maid inside,0.00015053309
a typical middle-class family her,0.24930286
she cleans the household she loves the children that she looks after and she lives a very very simple life,0.17220259
this is by no means a plot driven film it's very much character driven,0.091037594
we are following,0.017626498
cleo,0.04786704
seeing things happen to her through her eyes through her points of view,0.2660901
but it's more about a scene setting it's more about living,0.09978982
this immersive view into the family into this very specific time capsule of history and showing that maybe things haven't changed so much today in 2018 as we might like to think they have her on is a big fan of the effect that a cleverly constructed single take can bring he did it fantastically in children of men,0.08047498
one of my favorite movie scenes of all time and here in roma,0.112921745
there is another one that takes place on the beach and it's toward the end of the film but it is very much a climactic and extremely emotional moment on the beach in the waves all from the side angle of cleo as we follow her and we track her up and down the beach and into the water,0.057436354
no that she can't swim,0.19480012
and it is just it is so tense,0.07267458
it's done so simply that it's even more effective than if they put all this dramatic music all these cuts from the water under the water following around up close,0.110234804
it's sort of like by stepping back,0.067072235
and just following it in this real-time way it's it's even more like heart pounding,0.154421
I adored this film from start to finish,0.10708776
I was so invested in the character of Cleo in her decisions and how she was going to manage the obstacles that kept coming up against her the way that she fits into the family dynamics is really fascinating in the relationship especially between her and the mother you know the matriarch of the family how they kind of fit together it just felt really real they don't always see eye to eye but at the end of the day they both care for the children the only thing I will note is that this is portrayed in a romanticized wait a snapshot of time from qur'an's own childhood,0.09497644
so it's him as a filmmaker reflecting on his childhood you can see that come through in the film and in that as well some of the characters romanticized,0.0828026
so even though it's real and raw and tender,0.0871474
these are people that have been elevated in memory,0.14568894
because when you look back on things things always just seem different in memory,0.12285544
and that's certainly not a negative critique,0.07590498
if anything that's even more interesting to see the filmmaker himself within his own film which is really unusual to see it,0.08883711
so intertwined in such a way like this film is Kuran exploring his own memories of his own childhood,0.1552147
so I think that's absolutely fascinating,0.07492693
and the film Roma just is a delight guys,0.050847065
they have been my thoughts on our Funzone cool,0.09142574
bronze Roma do make sure you see it,0.068579696
it's available on Netflix see it in the cinema would be wonderful,0.052508153
but it is play,0.050914537
in such limited release,0.051135056
I myself was not able to on the big screen which was such a shame,0.21315026
but yeah I saw it on Netflix so do yourself a favor do go and see it I'm sure we'll be seeing this,0.116072826
one come up a lot during the Oscars season I am really hoping that it breaks out of its foreign language category and gets into the Best Picture category because it deserves to be in the Best Picture category on its own merit and shouldn't be just limited to the foreign language category,0.07221685
so I really hopefully see that thanks so much for hanging out with me today make sure you also subscribe to my channel here and keep up to date with all things movies and TV,0.1513701
