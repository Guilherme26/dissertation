wow what a time to be a horror fan,0.27222872
I'm not even a huge horror fan but you know what I'm gonna come over and join you guys because these smart high-quality productions are not only impressive but wildly entertaining I'm talking about get out it,0.33406967
and now a quiet place and you know what I'm gonna throw 10 Cloverfield Lane and split in there too and you know who produced a quiet place Michael freakin Bay,0.48285514
he actually produces a lot of horror movies he's behind the purge franchise now he does that one with Jason Blum and you might think well it's all blum,0.18220532
but this is Bay,0.07500084
you know you know Bay's the main producer here through his company Platinum Dunes,0.08964853
so clearly creatively there's more to him than meets the eye but the person who is really going to benefit from this movie as they should is Jim from the office he's directing he's co-writing he's co-starring,0.11071169
and well,0.04045563
I wouldn't say he's an auteur director I wasn't aware of his creative vision so much while watching the movie but after having seen it you realize his ability to deliver a slick complete and profound horror package,0.17422086
that's right profound is mighty impressive,0.0685807
and I would actually put his movie on par with those other films,0.2756838
I just listed and I hope that it enjoys the same success and recognition,0.09124286
and I think it will because the buzz from this for this movie coming out of South by Southwest where it premiered has been anything but quiet however when the movie starts you're going to think that I have lied to you because the first half of this film is super slow and by the time John Krasinski and his real-life wife Emily Blunt were slow dancing in silence,0.24054131
I was like those South by Southwest people lied to me but then after the movie is over you might think well I don't care,0.19550261
how good the second half is grace that first half should have been so boring,0.2531057
but here's the thing you realize that slow quiet first half of the movie was to prepare you,0.15007275
for,0.028156307
the roller-coaster ride that is the second half of the movie which is honestly one of the most terrifying movies I have ever seen,0.11818698
I know I don't have a high threshold for being able to take scares to be honest with you,0.120677166
but this is this movie I couldn't even look at the screen most of the time I was like I'm just gonna listen to it,0.068361744
I was so scared,0.1572369
I can't stress how much this movie had me in its grip,0.111334726
and I loved it I had a very good time now for instance I couldn't understand how this family was able to keep quiet especially from the jump scares in the movie like John Krasinski was like,0.09479632
oh I'm gonna go look out this window and see if there's a monster outside of it now I was like how are you gonna keep from screaming when his head pops up right,0.4429625
I mean I would just have duck I would just duck and cover and like a little hole and be like what I don't hear them anymore,0.31089434
I'll come out,0.10109091
this family had amazing self-control,0.1290963
I mean I guess under the circumstances they had to but I mean the movie really really will make you think could I keep quiet these circumstances,0.1259511
but again that's how much it got me,0.058195293
now why is the movie so successful,0.048364762
why is it self to have fine,0.079443894
well I have three reasons that I think is the answer now the first is that the monsters that are hunting them are not only very well designed but also fairly well realized VFX wise this movie costs just 17 million to make and I'm convinced that a very large portion of that was spent on visual effects,0.25455868
they are in the caliber of the highest blockbuster and like you really get to see them on screen - this isn't,0.07378961
like oh there's a monster,0.50665426
elbow I mean they do that too but eventually like you get full monster and well some of their behavior doesn't make sense when you think about it and we'll discuss it in the spoiler review it never occurred to me while I was watching the movie I was really impressed and blown,0.35132828
away I mean it was great,0.18848456
stuff and even now that I realized some problems with it I still wouldn't take points off the movie because it didn't occur to me while I was watching it was really good alright,0.0857105
then - this movie uses the domino,0.086435236
effect brilliantly like a seemingly small mistake triggers a series of increasingly bigger ones and bigger problems very much like real,0.106649496
life this family made a lot of mistakes we'll talk about the family,0.08415366
momentarily so the first half is a lot about setting up those dominoes to fall for the second half so think about that setting up dominoes boring watching them all fall quickly,0.17061745
exciting that's how you have to feel about the first half of the movie they needed to do the,0.05336391
work now three the quiet the quiet actually works because I think it pulls you in closer to the,0.12849197
story it's like when someone's like come closer and then they go boo and you jump because you know put you in that in that moment I think that's why I think that's what amplifies the scares because you think about it you're,0.26900354
like I've seen scary movies kind of in the same,0.12149999
vein before where monsters are chasing people around and on a farm,0.17915209
but the quiet I think just makes everything so much more heightened so you're more vulnerable to eventually being scared out of your,0.2244708
damn mind,0.8497373
now luckily nobody in my theater because it was a press screening and they had security watching us like hawks not to have our phones on so nobody made any noise,0.0817227
but there was a crucial moment during the movie when John Krasinski and Emily Blunt were actually able to have a conversation and a whispered conversation and some people outside the theater decided to have really loud discussion,0.060964093
I mean it wasn't their fault,0.15009093
they didn't know it was playing inside,0.058882385
and I think you know they were just talking normal normal voice well actually they were a little bit loud,0.40321207
but you know a regular movie had been playing inside our theater,0.13402854
it wouldn't have been a problem,0.08789387
but here they were kind of like background noise during this crucial moment,0.06316428
so I worry about people having a good viewing experience with this movie like going into it,0.07867436
I thought it would be fun,0.09714654
if people made jokes and chimed in and said a bunch of stuff during the beginning of the movie but now that I think about how important it is to get you to that place to experience the the second half maybe that one to keep you keep that from happening,0.06503214
so I think that if you when you go into this movie and I of course highly recommend that you do you might want to consider a matinee or even a morning show and maybe even paying extra for a premium theater just doing whatever you can to make sure you're with an audience,0.067498595
that's going to appreciate this and want to have the experience as it's meant to be,0.049838513
and not you know mess,0.29634196
it up just because you know they're not taking it too seriously,0.08938868
so that in addition to this movie being terrifying,0.16579945
here's another warning for you it is extremely sad Wow like it actually made me burst into tears,0.24037418
what's really surprised me I was like am i crying,0.13183495
what does I didn't like the family very much,0.09164466
but in fact I almost was like this is too sad like I was really sad,0.0863939
but you know what if you're gonna list it,0.06759591
if John Krasinski can elicit that kind of emotional reaction for me again for characters I did not really like,0.08055002
well then I have to say kudos to him now why didn't I like the family again no spoilers but they not only did they make like we're in a horror movie mistakes like if they didn't make mistakes there'd be no movie obviously right,0.10874792
you know like oh yeah and they did everything perfectly good job family but all so there are very bland and devoid of defined personalities like so often you know one thing,0.12133984
I'll say to you is that you know there's an argument about what child can do what chores on the farm and it there do they seem to be dividing it along gender lines and you would think that you know in a modern film you know this is supposed to take place in the near future that the daughter would be like really post-apocalyptic gender rules,0.15698856
are you kidding me with this,0.09329111
you know look like the only people practically left on earth,0.2113626
who cares don't worry I didn't spoil anything,0.12716052
so you know you would think that the conversations never went to that kind of real personal level like the characters didn't feel like real people in many ways,0.10391628
and then also for instance emily Blunt's character at the beginning of the movies pregnant so again not a spoiler and you're like,0.07146596
well,0.039254032
why would anyone have a baby in this situation,0.15624708
but they never discussed the pros and cons like I would have loved for them to be like,0.14990419
maybe,0.038781885
this is a John Connor baby and we hate we have to have it you know,0.2841514
but the you know the more we'll talk about this all a lot in the spoiler review but thinking about it after I saw the movie last night,0.115938485
I think that maybe that was intentional as well though to make the family more ciphers,0.11068218
so you can imagine yourself in this situation,0.12168191
and I did do that as I said I was like could I stay quiet in this situation,0.07520991
and I think maybe giving them more personality would have made the experience less intimate,0.19475757
and kept the audience at more of a distance so I'm still breaking this movie down in my head as to why it worked,0.1456302
so well why it's so effective,0.070380606
but what I am sure of is that it is incredible,0.03879427
it is an incredibly well-constructed movie like Wow probably not since inception has a film been able to manipulate me emotionally and mentally to exactly where it wants me,0.18193918
now inception for instance made me question reality for a few days,0.08725557
that's impressive but I didn't love the film because ultimately I thought it relied on cheap tricks but a quiet place I think because maybe it's a smaller film it created such an emotional intimate experience and it both terrified and made me very sad that it really got me,0.08503602
I think this is just a really well made film,0.101714425
I mean crits like almost like a magic trick,0.11650448
I'm not impressed with that,0.0929445
so yeah don't miss this movie it's very special and protect your movie going experience with this really think ahead be like this family,0.11078166
how are you gonna make sure that you learn,0.10164564
oh you're in an audience it stays quiet I almost wished they would make an announcement being like you might be tempted to chime in but you got to trust the movie and go with it or you're not gonna really experience,0.1549245
it the way it's meant to you're not gonna you're not gonna be able to experience that magic trick,0.1420745
and yes John Krasinski is definitely a triple threat to keep an eye on going forward,0.15282428
hey Jim,0.08249267
I'm so happy for him look for awhile like he wasn't gonna make it,0.17405325
let's see how his uh his uh Jack Ryan serious is on Amazon but anyway that's my review of a quiet place be sure to share your own thoughts down below if you've seen the movie do not spoil it,0.10202681
please again what people experienced that magic trick save your comments for the spoiler review and of course as always you can check out some more videos,0.07847268
right,0.04255815
