what's up guys it's will back again today's review is the newest Pixar film Coco,0.1512275
Coco directed by Lee Unkrich the director of Toy Story 3 takes place in Mexico,0.10574962
and primarily follows a young boy named Miguel who has a passion for music despite,0.104611546
the fact that his family forbids him from playing it an attempt to follow his,0.05382643
passion but Gael goes the search of his great-great-grandfather's guitar so he can use it,0.10800806
to enter a talent show however once Miguel locates the guitar he ends up in,0.07114673
a mysterious world known as the land of the dead Miguel joined by his dog,0.24239849
Dante and his travel companion Hector goes in search of his great-great-grandfather and Nestor de,0.0991867
la Cruz so that he can meet him and return Miguel back to the land,0.23994753
of the living and the rest of the film has spent watching Miguel attempt to,0.029182388
navigate his way through the land of the dead well he also attempts we figure,0.12621664
out the truth of his family and his love for music okay so Coco was,0.0950072
a film that was almost certainly expected to be great because Pixar very rarely misses,0.09512661
the mark there's a few times where the work hasn't been great most particularly in,0.08075162
the Cars franchise which everyone knows about but generally Pixar is expected to be the,0.059277646
leader of the cinema animation industry and the bar has already set pretty high for,0.0799449
most of their movies it sound like I was really blown away by the trailers,0.13756362
for Coco I was definitely looking forward to seeing it but it wasn't like on,0.080925174
my most anticipated list of the year or anything honestly though it probably should have,0.03910588
been because this is one of the best films of the year thus far and,0.066810645
easily the best animated film of the year thus far best that I've seen at,0.060683176
least I think this movie offers what a lot of other Pixar films the past,0.08891193
offer it's something for everyone I think you can take your kid to this movie,0.18347788
and they'll certainly have a great time with it you could take your significant other,0.055632114
to this movie and they'll have a good time with it how you could even,0.11556874
take your grandma to this movie and she'd enjoy it too I think it balances,0.4285253
all the things you'd expect to see out of a great animated film and turns,0.1515834
all that into a really really well-rounded experience I think this is what Pixar does,0.12836768
better than almost every one of their competitors I think a decent amount of adults,0.09518213
are hesitant to go out and see an animated film because the primary target audience,0.070076115
is generally kids and while that's still the case with Pixar films films like Coco,0.10081916
will still get a lot of adults in the theatre because they offer really rich,0.05187814
and emotional stories that carry adult themes as well I'll just let you know ahead,0.03959966
of time the Coco is a very emotional film I mean I know the ending,0.14895909
especially almost got me teary-eyed and usually pretty resilient with that kind of stuff I,0.14881508
do know for certain that plenty of people in the feeder with me were crying,0.23986377
because the lady next to me was and I noticed several others were as well,0.160603
but it's not like it's gut-wrenchingly sad it's sort of a happy sadness it's more,0.07796031
emblematic of excellent storytelling than anything else this is very much a journey that you,0.19015445
go on with Miguel and his companions and by the end of it the characters,0.16426143
grow so much which is exactly what you're looking for out of this kind of,0.115833424
film I think Coco separates itself from the recent pack of animated films because does,0.099589325
not just feel good kid content it's actually a lot more than that and this,0.07571501
story will resonate with people a lot longer than any generic animated film would but,0.0641963
this isn't to say there isn't feel-good kid stuff too there definitely is but it's,0.075853035
executed really well and never feels like it excludes the older audiences I think the,0.38680288
way Coco approaches its humor specifically is actually really impressive because it doesn't necessarily favor,0.055340406
one demographic over another it's kid driven first and foremost yes but there's definitely something,0.056369815
here for everyone in the comedy department as well as other departments I found this,0.08113817
film to have a ton of heart but I also found it to be very,0.04752579
clever comedic Lee as well not a lot of kid films balance the two so,0.14648096
proficiently but Coco is yet another Pixar film that pulls it off honest I think,0.114260234
Coco is one of their best films to date because of how well this movie,0.11296408
is balanced but from a technical perspective I think Coco really pushes the batteries of,0.04900357
the genre some of the animation and this film is breathtakingly good and I really,0.050745614
do love how each Pixar film looks better and better I mean this movie is,0.11551593
so colorful and so beautiful to look at that it's almost worth going to see,0.09072145
just for that I think the land of the Dead is honestly one of the,0.27289715
most beautiful things I've seen in a film this year this is just insane animation,0.3102845
and considering Coco is at least partially about music that's one of the big themes,0.084983625
of the movie I think you'd be really upset if the music in Coco sucked,0.76974475
but it doesn't it's actually pretty damn awesome actually do you want to give kudos,0.3449018
to Michael Giacchino for creating an amazing soundtrack year the music and Coco is so,0.0578943
versatile because there's moments where it's soothing and moments where it's exciting and energizing I,0.05375501
think that it's really really great and this is probably another category where Coco ranks,0.057180174
among the best of the year before we wrap up I just want to say,0.07189131
that the ending of this film is so great it not only makes the whole,0.101625904
journey feel worth it but it provides such a satisfying closure to the story of,0.04002508
these characters it's really heartwarming stuff and hit me in the fields way harder than,0.24947213
I expected - and that's how you know you're watching a great film I think,0.06609536
ultimately Coco is a movie that excels at basically everything you'd hope it would and,0.1747316
because of that I really do feel you should go out and see this one,0.1962007
whether you're a big fan of animated films or not I thought it had a,0.15379754
beautiful story about family and excellent balance of comedy and drama amazing visuals and some,0.07257297
awesome music and as expected honestly there's nothing bad I can say about this movie,0.07462144
I'm gonna give Coco a ten out of ten and recommend you go out and,0.24170718
catch this one in theatres you won't regret it so did you guys see Coco,0.10041418
yet what did you think of it and if not let me know why not,0.093608335
and also let me know your favorite Pixar movie I'm gonna go with Toy Story,0.095568135
3 but there's so many good options that's all for now that this is willfox,0.076283544
