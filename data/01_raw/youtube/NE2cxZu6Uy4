[Music] welcome one in all media fans the first-ever media were drew thanks for joining me and what I hope will continue to be a fun little channel where we can shoot this shoot on all things related to our free time and enjoyment this video if you haven't already figured it out is about the 2019 film book-smart produced by Annapurna and Gloria Sanchez productions and distributed by United Artists releasing and yes I'm going to address what will become the elephant in the room and bring up that other 2007 film which book-smart will inevitably be prepared to you know the one you know like perfect ten because that could be any number of things you know they can't really get you to that they could be like a bowling website yes super bad the cult classic and one of my personal all-time favorite movies ever book-smart is already being referred to as the quote-unquote female super bad and it's really a shame and a disservice to both films here's the thing the two films are similar yes and one is about two highschool dork suit decide that before they graduate they are going to indulge in some wild partying and lose their virginity the two dorks here are played by Michael Cera and Jonah Hill the other is a film about to high school dork suit decide that before they graduate they are going to indulge in some wild partying and maybe hook up with some classmates the two dorks here are being played by a Kaitlyn Dever and beanie Feldstein who coincidentally is Jonah Hill's real-life sister so yeah similar but like I said both films and actual execution style and real plot couldn't be more different super bad is really a wild ride about two best friends dealing with the fact of growing apart from one another Seth feeling that he's always held his friend Evan back with his ineptitude and Evan secretly wanting to distance himself and Seth because he feels that well he has the film is sneakily about the relationship to one another and the fact that these two bros won't be with each other after high school but this video isn't about super bed it's about book smart and book smarts actual premise isn't really the bare-bones synopsis you'll see either it's about two best friends who realize that while they spent highschool only worrying about their grades and extracurricular activities to get as far ahead in life as possible throwing parties and romantic interests aside those students who they thought only partied and got laid without focusing on school actually were and are going to just as prodigious colleges as they are this throws molly beanie Feldstein swirled upside down and she decides that her and Amy are gonna get an entire four years of debauchery and one night at one party listen it is very important that you keep the safety the first thing I need to talk about in regards to book smart and how much this movie works is in its dialogue the film's biggest success in my personal opinion the credit there certainly goes to the film's writers comprised of Emily Halpern Sara Hoskins Susannah Fogle and Katie Silverman a lot of media revolving teens has this thing where the characters in question always seem kind of fake the main culprit behind this is what I call teen speak you have 40 year old men writing teen dialogue and how they think teenagers talk is definitely not Riverdale is not the problem it's gonna take you to decide between music or baseball book-smart is so great because these girls actually sound like teens their conversations don't feel forced for the sake of making a movie and hitting plot points while trying to sound hip I read that this movie went under many on the fly rewrites director Olivia Wilde yes that Olivia Wilde told her cast that if a piece of dialogue didn't seem authentic that they should improvise it in a way that did and I gotta say they succeeded on all fronts Molly and Amy feel so real because they are they aren't contrived teens written by how chad chattington thinks his daughter acts they're carefully created four dimensional girls made by many funny women the two funniest Molly and Amy these two girls really seem like best friends the chemistry between them is fantastic a lot of credit here belongs to different Feldstein as they really helped create these two with the improv dialogue as mentioned previously wild ask these two to live together in order to develop a wrapper between them and they did for ten weeks they live together and this experience definitely shines through in the film no but we lived together during the movie and it was the greatest time filled with snacks and pancakes and sleeping until 2:00 p.m. because we would get home at 6:00 a.m. because we would start our days at 6:00 p.m. because we had night shoots well one could argue that Devers amy is the classic quote unquote straight man to felt stains goofball it's really not the case both do amazing work in making both Amy and Molly have their moments and not file under any specific trope because we were so prepared when we got there we were able to have so much fun because we knew exactly who our characters from you know exactly the story we were telling we knew the lines we knew the day and we could just be free and actually really enjoy it yeah and it was also great to get to do that with you I feel like sometimes your passion doesn't really match with the passion of the other actor on the film that you're doing but beany and I both came at it with with so much passion and drive and love for these two girls and we both had a deep understanding knowing that we had to get this dialogue exactly right because this movie relies on it and they're always matched always together yeah another reason book-smart is so great as in this one a teeing of the typical teen stereotype the popular kids aren't just dumb jocks and pretty girls they're real people too last a present for my favorite team Jared you're not my student I've heard great things and hey everybody else got their graduation guess right come on Jer bear coming at you from all angles right nobody asked for that big me little over me well baby jar at the bottom the supporting cast is so well written too compared to most any other high school comedy I mean book smarts plot is kick lined because Molly realizes that her classmates aren't the one-dimensional idiots that she thought there were many moments and interactions throughout the 105 minute runtime where we see that these other students aren't just cheap characters even the typical theater kids are written and played so genuinely and not for a cheap gag or punchline that it really makes you feel for these characters Shakespeare in the Park gang what we will be performing the Bart's comedies as modern tragedies outside Whole Foods across town was actually funny it's what we did in my summer program last year in Barcelona when I lived in because of this book smart really gets you and it immerses you in this high school experience honestly with it being one of the best depictions in media not everything though can be without fault and book-smart does become a little dazed ex machina towards the end but so do most comedies so I can't really fault it too much for that but certain situations are either gotten out of her avoided seemingly with no problem at all I don't want to go into specifics due to supply their reasons but I'm sure those who have seen this film know what moments I'm referring to and don't get me wrong this film isn't cheapened at all by these moments it doesn't have validate anything it just happens to be slightly upsetting when this film has been doing most everything else perfectly the biggest triumph of book-smart is in its representation this is a movie written by four women directed by a woman starring women all of which are at the top of their game it's probably why this movie feels so fresh these are perspectives which we rarely see out of Hollywood and this movie proves and we need more of them book smart is a success not just because of the of its creators but it should be mentioned because if film-like book-smart is rarely made it's about a strong female friendship I think that that is what this movie is about it it's more I think it's a movie that will make you laugh she's got a really cute smile not as sharp as your chin it's a movie that'll make you cry it's it's not only a comedy and it's not only a film just made for women I think that seeing two female leads on the poster I think that people have this like misconception of oh this is a movie only for women but literally it's a movie for everybody I've never seen one of these characters at the center of the film let alone two of them and the fact that they're I mean they couldn't be less competitive with each other they're actually like aggressively obsessed Sophie's not there no no no not excited come on okay allow me this beautiful he's really really special this is a raunchy comedy about two teenage girls one of which who happens to be a lesbian and the film never turns her or them in escape goats for cheap sex gags or one-liners it's just a funny ass movie I put out a message and asked my female friends to give their thoughts on this movie as they would be way more accurate in describing how important it is to them and our current climate and here are some of their thoughts [Music] overall book smart is worth it a hilarious film with plenty of portability which you should definitely add to your library a huge success for first-time director Olivia Wilde a great vehicle to show the many talents of Kaitlyn Dever beanie Feldstein in the rest of the cast one of if not the way to look at how to write and create teenagers believably and finally one of the best comedy films of the decade book smart is well worth the price of a ticket a DVD and your time see it now as its box office hasn't really indicated what a truly great film it is thank you for watching this video and beginning this journey of a channel with me once again this was a media redrew and until next time I know this is unrealistic and bad for women but
