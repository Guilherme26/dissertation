the story comes the movies biggest flaw also you see as the story's going along,0.029925946

of a movie should be to tell a good story but the movie did have,0.023707146
a really good story so I'd say it feels like half and half at the,0.027502684
time it felt like they were showing this big world just for the sake of,0.037123233
doing it and the other half of the time it felt like it was more,0.031254318

but when I think back to all the great Pixar movies we've gotten they do,0.0545863
follow a pretty basic formula there's always that one point I think back to the,0.023747722
first toy story where Woody and Buzz are on the street and they're trying to,0.020805614

have grown to love over the course of an hour and a half they've lost,0.060958758
and then by some glimmer of hope they actually managed to pull through the situation,0.030369624
and it's a happy ending I'm just saying the pics are formulas getting kind of,0.04287042
