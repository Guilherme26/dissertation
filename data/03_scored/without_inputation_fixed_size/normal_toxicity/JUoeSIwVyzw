hello and welcome back to screen fanatic I am knowledge and today we'll be reviewing,0.16607003
the classic movie The Godfather first let me say this this movie for its time,0.10946743
is I think it was it was it was advanced it was it was ahead,0.055516325
of allowing the other films around that time as far as filmmaking screenwriting and even,0.077593066
producing this movie was just it had a lot of hidden gems all throughout the,0.08916915
entire movie now the movie is four hours long so it's a ton of it's,0.089076996
a ton of just scenes in lines in the movie that just you can apply,0.07810162
to your your everyday life as far as it's your own life even if you,0.69542736
have a family you know you have a wife you have children now to say,0.1421746
you're doing something illegal but I mean it's just it was it was very meaningful,0.17061278
the entire movie the weight of the screen was the way that the sprint was,0.069029234
written and just everything about the film so I'm gonna start from the beginning with,0.039955687
this film because it it was a lot of it was just a lot of,0.07471659
things that I had to kind of had to absorb and take in and I,0.06630413
wanted to make sure that I got it right and doing this film review because,0.0651005
this is a very classic movie that I still love watching today and it's just,0.09458108
it's very meaningful so from the beginning um basically the director is Francis Ford Coppola,0.07915605
who's a great director and he's best known for his three Godfather films part the,0.05476371
first part part two and as well as part three and then you also have,0.05458168
the screenwriter which is Mario Puzo or I don't know if I'm saying his name,0.117009535
correctly excuse me if I'm butchered his name but I believe is Mario Puzo or,0.23763344
puzzle in Mario Puzo he does this was some of his best work like I,0.06777335
I look to my research to see what kind of work that he did on,0.08346515
other films and he out of two other films song summer comedy but this is,0.115971185
one of the most I think this is some of his most prized work kind,0.19147372
of like an artifact you know but I mean it was great and then you,0.11722215
had a star-studded cast you had Marlon Brando who played Vito Corleone II The Godfather,0.106192924
did done you had a you had al pacino who played Michael Curley only the,0.12178713
son James can he plays Santino Corleone II Sonny you have Robert Duvall who plays,0.13753787
Tom Hagen which is the adopted son the lawyer of the family you had a,0.15004964
Talia Shire I don't know if I'm pronouncing her name right - excuse me but,0.14410812
as she plays the the sister and but she you know if you can remember,0.05222094
correctly she was also in the the series or the sequence of films with what,0.094771616
Sylvester Stallone the rocky she played Adrian Adrian so anyways but this is this is,0.09675176
a great film right off the get-go a scene that's very memorable for me was,0.08571072
where were they having a sit-down and one of the guys come to they arranged,0.23172344
the meeting and one of the guys he comes to thee what comes to the,0.06159966
meeting with a proposition for the done for Vito to start selling you know start,0.087706536
selling drugs so you know he has a lot of very he has a lot,0.2417157
of incentives for the Corleone family and he wants Vito to come in because Vito,0.08636333
has a lot of politicians in his pocket and all the other five families are,0.048376188
basically on board they're ready they're backing you know they're just waiting for Vito cause,0.10174248
Vito out all at this time out of all the five families they all are,0.08965094
strong they have a lot of stripper Beto is like the glue Beto is like,0.31089434
the originator he's like the beginning like he's like one of the first ones to,0.11031722
really come to power within his family and to really take this done La Cosa,0.081101745
Nostra la famiglia to the next level but he's old school and that's why he's,0.29346865
been able to survive so long because he makes move and he's a he's a,0.14779112
he's very deep and thinking so they cut off so all the other families are,0.346572
already on board they come to Vito Vito beat always the pros and the cons,0.19578512
and he basically says the science against it and I think he decides against them,0.0799325
he knows right away I gotta bring in something I gotta I got to I,0.12250451
have to alert some of my muscle to keep an eye on this fellow because,0.10922653
he's not the type to take know the right way correctly he's the type to,0.16100352
want to get together with the other families in and to oppose me and try,0.17652762
to take me out you know so basically that's what he does he brings in,0.17976253
Luca Brasi and he tells Luca Brasi to kind of be like a spider going,0.06482022
they're kind of spiky piling this guy Tony you're not happy with the family you,0.15526515
know you're not happy what we're doing over here and to invest the report back,0.06764558
to me so Luca Brasi does this and he says you know I'm not happy,0.093527064
maybe you guys make me an offer here and to give a more in depth,0.10185509
perception of Luca Brasi is a very big guy very muscular known for just best,0.049433146
but he comes in when he needs to take when they need him to take,0.082359925
care of any problem that is physical I mean he's a very intimidating looking individual,0.1936859
very physically imposing but the the opposition kana is able to kind of fill this,0.18795732
out and they kind of plot a setup a plot against it to where it,0.09695653
was no mass for three to four individuals that take him out you know he,0.10832843
tried to put up a fight but they're able to take him out so actually,0.18118568
I want to go back to a scene prior to that happening before this meeting,0.15179735
is adjourned between between Vito and his and his family in the salaat see died,0.24723741
his son Santino aka Sonny before he tells him what when he when he insists,0.1599001
no Sonny steps up and says wait wait a minute you can't you guarantee you,0.09499577
know what he's basically hashing over the benefits in his head and Vito kind of,0.24194975
like tells him Sonny you know kind of like makes him back up a little,0.14958915
bit and he says and he tells slot-c says you have to excuse my children,0.31089434
let me try to do it in his voice you have to excuse my children,0.40318343
I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them as you can,0.15744667
see they talk when they should be listening but that was a very great scene,0.06186107
is you know eventually basically what he was saying is you know he's compassionate for,0.080459066
his children he has a weakness for them and in a sense they are spoiled,0.35925353
but you know you're dealing with me so but that kind of gave slot-c a,0.15521501
little a little traction a little bit like Sonny was half of my deal you,0.31089434
know so as you can see the wheels are already put in motion as far,0.03513488
as all right well Vito assists no and then the thing with Luca Brasi happens,0.07182584
and they take Luca Brasi out so I really don't want to go into the,0.0876999
movie but this is a very very clever movie it's very thoughtful it makes you,0.15258783
think it makes you a pile a lot of the scenes to your own life,0.44430587
and how you will move as far as how you would deal with people is,0.07957991
very this every a lot of the scenes are about power as far as how,0.06135873
you leverage it in your own way and to come on come out on top,0.2648565
I mean I can go on and on I mean as far as the characters,0.11039952
you have Santino you have Luca Brasi you have Clemenza you have Tom Hagen you,0.27315786
have Tesio you have Fredo which is the brother and this film was very good,0.07689336
because it focuses on character development and as I've said in my other reviews that,0.04385447
anytime the film the producers and the screenwriters take the time to really focus on,0.039489336
character development from the beginning and how they come into play later in the film,0.057095923
and all throughout the film makes a huge difference nine times out of ten they,0.042175174
always make for great films so I mean like I said I want to I,0.14179926
don't want to cut this films I don't want to cut this review short but,0.15403284
I want to keep it going because this is such a classic film that I,0.12596525
don't mind going about over my normal time period as far as my reviews because,0.090672016
this I this is I owe it to this film so no after you have,0.17240694
after you have Luca Brasi taken all the Godfather is eventually gunned down but he,0.22359179
ends up surviving now in the myths in the midst of that taking place know,0.05019404
Selassie comes to Tom Hagen and tells them all right well we know Sonny is,0.1445499
up next he's he's immediately acting Godfather so I want you to go to Sonny,0.22506133
and I want you to convince some hey we don't want war but convince him,0.15229793
to go along the plan as as I would like to do so so he,0.07299484
says okay I will talk to him but you know Sonny he's very hot-headed he's,0.63801587
very emotional but let me see what I can do and they know this so,0.054606333
he says I'll see what I can do but even Sonny won't be able to,0.10858751
call off Luca Brasi now so Selassie is kind of a thinker and he tries,0.15497568
to he's a chess player he likes to move steps ahead so with them knowing,0.09814837
this he says well you let me worry about Luca Brasi and at the time,0.07134166
Tom Hagen is not aware of this he's not aware of this at all oh,0.18356423
excuse me for saying somebody's busted my line okay so yeah so Tom Hagen isn't,0.15384057
aware of this at the moment so as their as their little rendezvous is adjourned,0.1346282
one of his one of Selassie gods pulls over since hey he lets him know,0.077827215
he's alive he survived two men you know i temped on his life he survived,0.4456191
so now this kind of ruins his plans he's upset by this news and he,0.11508804
says Tom we hit him with five shots and he's still alive and he says,0.5710685
this is gonna be bad news for me and it's gonna be bad news for,0.16005182
you if you don't get Sonny to make that deal so this kind of offsets,0.14838853
a lot of the timing and a lot of the plans that were supposed to,0.018817756
take place so after this this is this is a very key moment in the,0.039792426
film because it's like what's gonna happen this you know the Kirlian currently only family,0.18987557
member The Godfather he survived but he's gonna be gone for a while cuz he's,0.14442475
an older guy we gotta figure out what's going on we gotta still run we,0.061236683
gotta run off the family's business and affairs all in once so within this time,0.08114625
period you have you have Michael currently only he starts to get involved in the,0.11751627
family business now to kind of take a few back steps Michael currently owned it,0.0715703
from the beginning didn't want anything to do with the family business he was very,0.04332688
he was he was adamant about that you know in fact he ended up joining,0.10619905
the Marines or yeah end up joining Marines to kind of get away from the,0.110923745
family business which his family didn't agree with because his father had it set up,0.056781024
for him to go to college at Furman to be more into you know governing,0.2171982
govern government politics politics type of thing maybe like a you know a senator or,0.14401147
a councilman a mayor or governor something to that extent but of course Michael had,0.086942196
other plans and you know he he stood strong on it but when his father,0.075365014
gets harmed he find the ins up he is a finding out through his girlfriend,0.16384745
at the time which is Kate and while they're out in fact how they're finding,0.056985315
out while they're out doing Christmas shopping she just happens to take a glimpse at,0.14940172
the newspaper and season you know be toker Leone feared be being killed by by,0.31089434
gunfire but it doesn't say whether he's dead or not so she says Michael she's,0.30079255
trying to get his attention and she shows him the paper and immediately Michael starts,0.19284962
to panic and he's very like you know distress he needs to figure out what's,0.17414458
going on with his father he stops by a payphone makes a phone call hey,0.07881475
Sonny what's going on you know is I see that pop has been shot is,0.24166037
he in a hospital doesn't say whether he's dead or not and they said yeah,0.26349005
the old man is in the hospital but we don't know you know he looked,0.19253545
like he may pull through but it's very you know very he's very critical at,0.08819134
this moment so immediately my co-stars to a sin he starts to step into the,0.14211199
family business giving advice no dude let's try to do this let's do that and,0.0661885
at first they're kind of like kind of like waving them off Jesus love young,0.1055729
brother he doesn't really know nothing about family it's the family business and politics as,0.08307709
far as the affairs and how we move and do things just you know we're,0.054348323
gonna protect them he's our younger brother but kind of stay out of it you,0.20563762
know that's how they kind of treat Michael but Michael is actually giving very sound,0.075923145
advice so before that scene actually happens going back to the beginning because there's a,0.0643849
lot of things that come into place later in the movie but going back to,0.07726793
the beginning of the movie when Michael's is all decked out in his medals and,0.12730317
Marine uniform he counted he's telling Kay his girlfriend about a little bit about the,0.114579804
family business because she was inquiring about Luca Brasi like I said Luca Brasi is,0.062646694
very intimidating very physically opposing us his look he kind of gives her a little,0.19754899
brief description on it and going into the family business and he tells Kate it's,0.04705781
my family kids not me you know so fast for moving forward so now that,0.23987885
this is taking place Michael is he's really he really wants in now he really,0.11088127
wants to go forward and and really do all he can to help so upon,0.08771708
doing this you know he he starts to really get involved in a sin and,0.1571433
go higher and higher and this is kind of like where the the film kind,0.059300218
of transcends they they their producers did a great job of shooting Michael to kind,0.3871689
of show like wow does give great advice and but a kind from this from,0.04181396
that point on as his father is healing it they're producing they kind of zoom,0.0752037
in on Mike to kind of show like all right from this point on were,0.072151326
kind of moving and to be into the Michael Corleone II stage of the film,0.03447399
now that kind of showed that you know he's accumulating his power and he's really,0.077235
just it's really and he's a natural addict at being a godfather and being a,0.3063903
nun and Michael starts to really step up and take over so I'll stop right,0.1533046
there without going in any further because this is it's like it's a very long,0.08529808
film but it's very it's it's great it's not slow at any point you won't,0.07514279
miss you you'll be on a it's very gripping you'll be on the answer you,0.12564898
see watching it and you can watch this film over and over again but this,0.10000597
is a great film four stars like give this look film a four star rating,0.036549494
this is like I said I love watching the zoom and I kind of love,0.076498315
love watching it around family you know sometimes well for the most part my family,0.06166876
does it they don't completely understand it like I do and break it down like,0.14418276
I do but that's why I'm here to do the review so but this is,0.06830414
a great film four star rating I love a lot of the scenes the the,0.02723218
discussions the side discussions that a lot of individuals are having in the scenes the,0.084174514
roundtables where it's like a panel discussion where they're working out differences I mean this,0.11168154
is a great film from top to bottom I love the way it was put,0.07836624
together I would like to see it redone in a modern version but I don't,0.10477395
want it to take away from the original version but it has to be has,0.07346573
redone and a modern version it has to be great a as far as acting,0.15021132
screen writing producing directing it has to be up to par it cannot say oh,0.11102625
man they should have just never remained it you know but if that's the case,0.14570643
then don't remake it because this such a great film I mean I love our,0.06721536
Pacino I mean every all the characters were you know you could see how they,0.08112564
all come into play this was an outstanding film for from producing to directing to,0.046603918
oscar-worthy performances from the actors from a lot of this the screen shots with the,0.11861782
way they were able to capture different moments in the film how the by them,0.060795408
doing so it kind of focuses all more so on the actual scene or the,0.058999848
purpose of the character versus them giving a dot a specific type of dialogue but,0.05715227
