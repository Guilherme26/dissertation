hello everybody today I'm going to be reviewing Citizen Kane this came out in 1941,0.26049197
it was directed by Orson Welles he also co-wrote it and starred in it and,0.049702276
produced it and you all knew that this was coming because I talk about worse,0.18821032
and Welles so damn much how could I not eventually get to the point where,0.5749793
I had to review Citizen Kane so here you go Orson Welles really needs no,0.08774474
introduction at this point especially if you are a sent a file but I'll give,0.13021882
him one anyway just because it really does feed into the inception of Citizen Kane,0.08762328
in terms of his history as a creative person he was 25 years old when,0.08336553
the film was made but before that point ever since he was a little kid,0.14913498
he was considered to be a child prodigy and he was very ambitious he grew,0.1589851
up to be this iconoclast who changed the medium of all kinds of different art,0.08960212
forms you changed the medium of theater on Broadway when he went to New York,0.09230874
at age 21 and did a lot of very famous performances there from you know,0.039617453
Shakespearean plays and such and of course he changed radio with his very infamous War,0.2987296
of the Worlds broadcast when he was 23 years old in the late 30s and,0.047241088
at the time he was on fire he was considered just this great genius people,0.16918029
bowed down to him and they thought he could do no wrong and so of,0.10101251
course eventually Hollywood called because at the time Hollywood was such a mecca still is,0.08100754
but not to the point that it was back in the 30s but Hollywood had,0.04557484
such faith in him that they gave him complete creative control to do whatever he,0.06644744
wanted basically and from what I understand Welles had several ideas and Citizen Kane is,0.056198377
what they decided on but the fact that they gave him total control is just,0.05311903
it staggers the imagination especially for somebody that is 25 years old it was unheard,0.08511549
of it never happened since course Citizen Kane is known to be one of the,0.05926304
great films of all time and you know the American Film Institute ranks in number,0.090517975
one as the greatest American film ever made and so you know if you're a,0.07569858
fan of film it's like the buy home American movies you know most really big,0.07470538
film fans have seen this film but ironically it was not very popular when it,0.052845947
came out it did get some notoriety certainly with critics but it wasn't a big,0.10411433
box-office smash like that Citizen Kane is known for being very innovative for kind of,0.086217634
breaking the form of so many Hollywood films up to that point technically in terms,0.093731776
of story ironically I find this film to be Welles at his most safe certainly,0.10624285
at his most kind of tame it's his most commercially acceptable film that he ever,0.133742
made I think because he was such a novice and he really didn't know that,0.15241002
much about film he was kind of feeling his way through testing the waters as,0.06487526
he was making the film I think it only makes sense for this film to,0.09208095
be kind of more of a blank slate for him but for this to be,0.087816626
his first big commercial film his first Hollywood film you can see it he was,0.07218379
just so beyond his years and everyone has tried to emulate this film in some,0.107881084
form in pretty much every way without that film movie certainly would not be what,0.10177873
they are today Welles is a very big personality and he certainly has quite an,0.07135094
ego as well and that really does come through in his films I think because,0.17391045
this movies just tend to be very very dramatic in pretty much every sense of,0.170716
the word everything from the very Shakespearean nature of the way that the characters speak,0.08709556
in the wind that the dialogue certainly and the strange humor the very dark shadows,0.11531451
the gothic angles it's very expressionistic it's very creative and it broke so many rules,0.12820467
I have to say when I ask people what they think about when they think,0.07627889
about Citizen Kane they think about technical prowess because technically the film was so innovative,0.07516011
as I said but I think honestly deep I mean below that I think there's,0.10556857
a lot in the film that resonates with people because of the story the story,0.05298608
itself is I think very entertaining at its heart is a story that is very,0.085856006
familiar has very grandiose themes and it is a kind of tragic cautionary tale with,0.065837115
Charles Foster Kane as the protagonist people are people are drawn to drama they're drawn,0.14927736
to excess and extraordinary people not only do they have big personalities but they they,0.12029067
are like exaggerated versions of us they're they're very manipulative they're very motivated by X,0.24072434
and greed most of the time people like this are people that come off is,0.16540998
very confident but they are often the most insecure the most sad the most flawed,0.1278184
people and they don't know how to connect on a human level so they use,0.3418882
all of this excess to fill those voids and that is precisely the story of,0.15463263
Charles Foster Kane in terms of his downfall even though maybe the film may alienate,0.10204999
some viewers because they may find it a little bit too strange or maybe a,0.1466377
little bit too esoteric the film is a story that we've seen many many times,0.08268335
and it's that rags to riches story you know in the case of this film,0.1536395
you start with a very young child who is you know taken from his family,0.26143673
and he becomes a young man who runs a newspaper and then he becomes this,0.091349
very notorious very wealthy mogul glorified by the public and by the media what I,0.07861525
love about this film is how the core story is framed it's framed and told,0.06424144
through the eyes of the journalists and through the media that are trying to figure,0.067179725
out who the real Kane is the man behind this emblem of American success they're,0.118318014
so fascinated by who he must have been behind that persona so what they do,0.16350295
they try to interview all of these people in his life like ex-wives people that,0.33520734
he worked with and friends because they're just looking for some kind of key some,0.067079246
kind of answer to all these questions I think that's part of what the film,0.07863914
is trying to say is that there are so many interpretations to everything everything is,0.04001055
so complex and in this case everyone that he knew has their own interpretation of,0.059426438
who Kane was depending on you know who the person was and at what time,0.079774626
they knew him in his life so who can truly know the difference between the,0.15030773
persona and the man and that idea is reflected in the the way that the,0.061342113
film is structured because it has a very elliptical feel to it and I have,0.07727656
seen the film many times but I honestly I couldn't tell you how its structured,0.06919897
scene for scene because it's not a beginning middle and end sort of thing you,0.15745632
know as I said it's told through the framework of these journalists interviewing all of,0.08102472
these people and it goes back in time and then forward quite a bit when,0.116506666
you've got all of these little pieces all over the place it's often near impossible,0.19266792
to try to make sense of it all as a whole but even though I'm,0.079556085
talking a lot about the story as a film nerd I'm probably more fascinated by,0.4437247
just the look of the film even by today's standards this film just looks very,0.051031064
contemporary and especially for that time this was just a major jump forward it felt,0.088622116
like in terms of how innovative it was I mean the camera moves so fluidly,0.08279618
and compared to so many Hollywood movies at the time where the camera was just,0.051482003
very stagnant very still and I think that people like maybe David Fincher might have,0.07381749
borrowed from wells in the sense that when you watch a feature film he loves,0.096948795
to make films that have touches of CGI here and there but he likes to,0.11783058
make it very subtle he wants to kind of confuse the audience member so that,0.10960698
they don't know what they're watching is real and what is enhanced by digital techniques,0.10825969
wells really was one of the first people to use that particularly in Hollywood as,0.089428976
it was becoming bigger and bigger and the special effects in this film are used,0.07917125
so subtly to make each image work and the fluidity of it the angles of,0.05349213
it and the shadows the use of deep focus it's just so complex and so,0.055778123
interesting to look at and even though Welles was a showman obviously he was a,0.08345481
magician and a performer the special effects and the the visual style that he's going,0.06917254
for it means something it's not just a show for the sake of showing his,0.08722215
visual prowess like his use of deep focus that's one of my favorite things that,0.10701738
he's ever utilized in any of his films I just love that style it works,0.24350794
very well for him and you know it allows for such dimension in terms of,0.05154979
the look of it so it's literal dimension but also figurative dimension because there's so,0.07022723
much going on in the background to the foreground it basically tells the story that,0.04980834
the characters never have to say so basically when you look at a shot you,0.31089434
could see all kinds of different things built around a certain character that might be,0.055676095
at the center of the shot that's a metaphor for the fact that there's so,0.10682225
much beneath the surface beneath what is said and what the characters may do but,0.0488154
even though the film is known for being one of the great films the whole,0.06978564
time it obviously has its detractors and there has been some criticism of it that,0.06845548
the film has such technical bravura but it's not matched with emotional potency and I,0.06469408
can actually see where they're coming from because especially if you know Wells is later,0.07051044
work even though most of it is largely forgotten by mainstream audiences he became much,0.054232847
more mature as a storyteller as he went on like even even the Magnificent Ambersons,0.13668588
which came out not too long after Citizen Kane that is a very heartbreaking very,0.076467715
emotional piece that to me is far more evolved than Kane is but that being,0.14649744
said I actually find a lot of emotional moments in Kane that really do resonate,0.051973365
with me when Kane meets Susan his second wife for the first time that's when,0.13177882
the film really starts to hone in on something that has gravitas it's a really,0.06705683
sad relationship because he's drawn to her for her naivete her innocence her humor her,0.2986181
the fact that she needs to be taken care of and they meet Kane relates,0.181618
to her in that sense because he sees kind of a version of who he,0.15439622
was when he was younger before all the success and all of that and it's,0.069533736
at the tender scene and a sad one because of how I mean once you,0.14674608
see the film and you go back and watch it it's maybe very bittersweet because,0.08756523
you see how the relationship turns sour quite quickly their relationship gets to the heart,0.121074304
of what makes Kane so flawed he's a man who was used to covering everything,0.24944913
up as I said with extravagance with politics with publicity and wealth to distract him,0.10163803
from what he wanted most all he really wanted as we all do all we,0.054619707
really want is to be loved and he wanted to be able to understand himself,0.08873495
but because he couldn't grasp that or himself he turned outward for any means of,0.09780002
control and that happened to be in the form of Susan he starts to control,0.051612165
her and starts trying to turn her into his puppet into this opera singer that,0.4911482
she's obviously not meant to be that's when you realize how selfish how insecure he,0.6744997
is she becomes his possession essentially that really reflects what happened so many marriages and,0.08087212
relationships if you can't understand the person that you're with you try to turn them,0.28054255
into a version of yourself or the person you were or the person that you,0.3036926
want to be as the film goes on it unmasks this kind of male dominant,0.34212434
man that depends on prowess and that public persona of course I can't talk about,0.08346707
Citizen Kane without mentioning one of the most famous devices utilized in American movie history,0.058296002
and that of course is the famous rosebud which the film is built around rosebud,0.025671806
at its most basic level is a metaphor for nostalgia for the innocence of chav,0.1123044
of childhood that was taken away from him but I don't know if I buy,0.08142073
into the idea that rosebud should be this MacGuffin that's supposed to represent the point,0.092291206
of the film because I think that that's too simplistic it's certainly way too simplistic,0.09534467
for Welles I don't think that he saw it as a powerful device either even,0.07841985
when he was making it I think he found it amusing and used it as,0.06763522
a joke in an interview he once called it a tawdry device a dollar book,0.24072708
Freudian gag and he wasn't very proud of it what I think is a much,0.26112103
more powerful metaphor and one that works much better would be the idea of the,0.053303607
puzzle pieces because you see puzzle pieces used throughout the film all the time that's,0.08025566
just far more effective as a device because it represents this tapestry of elements that,0.09437
we are trying to fit together in order to understand life people focus on rosebud,0.110030785
because it's clear and it's easy rosebud to me is that joke on the audience,0.10282585
because obviously there's much more to the film than that and obviously you can't sum,0.0775194
up a single memory or a man's life with just one word as I said,0.15238148
I really admire this film a lot obviously but I don't think it's the best,0.08294317
film ever made I don't think you can really say that there is one film,0.09928684
that is the greatest film ever made just like you can't say there's one piece,0.102927834
of music that's the best music ever made there's no such thing it's all up,0.073171385
to interpretation Welles made so many interesting films that push the envelope way harder I,0.10113325
mean my favorite film of his is the trial masterpiece not an easy one to,0.100851774
understand and I don't recommend it to people unless you're of course in a file,0.10883759
but it is same with the films like f-for fake he he did so many,0.46591702
amazing works but I think the reasons this and Cain has enjoyed is because it's,0.06982947
that balance between maybe a more esoteric style that pushed the boundaries and something that,0.05544166
was mainstream that people could latch on to in terms of the core story it,0.053408574
has an accessibility that films that I think are far better do not have like,0.13676651
as I said the trial or a film like wings of desire or The Passion,0.054610122
of Joan of Arc to me I think are far better films but they just,0.10078944
don't have that accessibility and I know a lot of times I always say that,0.076986335
I'm against accessibility but I think at a certain point in order to you know,0.11720109
as I said bring people together and have something resonate and be there as maybe,0.061102267
a benchmark that people can emulate or try to be inspired by you need to,0.1063386
have that to be able to further the medium of film or whatever medium we're,0.04242696
talking about so in that sense I think Citizen Kane is really wonderful and should,0.06613385
be studied and it is greatly admired and it's also a really just it's a,0.1664109
good film it's entertaining it's a great story and that is my review thank you,0.083994515
