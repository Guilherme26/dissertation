of innocent people I couldn't just stand by looks like an army out there Malcolm,0.12023394
X has a movie Nelson Mandela has a movie Gandhi has a movie William Wallace,0.042849135
has a movie countless movies have been made about people who face similar insurmountable odds,0.046162415
yet still managed to change the world driven by a desire to see their people,0.10495068
no longer suffer so where is the Martin Luther King jr. movie why is Hollywood,0.09298469
ignored one of the most important historical figures in the 20th century who has been,0.036352288
honored in countless ways everywhere else including a national holiday well the sad reason is,0.017282136
that Luther's descendants have the rights to his speeches under a tight lockdown and licensed,0.30113736
those rights exclusively in 2009 to DreamWorks and Warner Brothers who are currently just sitting,0.0151755
on them after Oliver Stone decided not to direct an MLK jr. film after all,0.035476238
yes the Kings have a dream of getting paid so well they haven't come out,0.04873202
against Selma they haven't supported it either and the filmmakers here were forced to alter,0.036001734
every single line the Martin Luther King jr. spoke in public or else be sued,0.05097036
but well the Martin Luther King jr. estate has powerful sway over his legacy there,0.01771251
are powerful forces at work behind Selma Oprah Winfrey is a producer on the film,0.020747744
and a co-star which lends considerable credibility to the project and on top of that,0.016761297
Selma is also being produced by the team behind 12 years of slave Brad Pitt's,0.038565353
Plan B shingle headed up by Dede Gardner and Jeremy kleiner after dominating at last,0.032290008
year's Oscars the 12-years team clearly has some strong awards connections which has alright resulted,0.012460886
in numerous Golden Globe nominations for Salma including the first ever nomination for a black,0.029669851
female director Ava Duvernay as Martin Luther King jr. still opening doors for his people,0.1029977
Selma is also relevant today because of the nationwide protests over the deaths of Michael,0.039915673
Brown and Eric garner where there is a struggle between nonviolent and violent protesters Oprah,0.09387005
has already told the morning talk shows that she hoped Selma will inspire protesters to,0.024294503
lean more towards non-violence and to realize that strong leadership and a clear message are,0.058677845
vital to getting results then there's David Roy yellow the UK actor who American audiences,0.039814565
are certainly familiar with but probably still can't name check will this be a star-making,0.0064522815
turn or go largely unrecognized on interest elbows mandela having now seen Salma I can,0.02811066
say that it's not only one of the top ten films of the year but,0.02184064
one of the top films in recent memory it really does deserve to have the,0.020441093
kind of Oscar nominations that Birdman boyhood and the grand Budapest hotel are enjoying and,0.025251037
it's truly tragic even more so that David O yellow and especially Ava Duvernay are,0.021159492
not nominated for their work is the Academy racist because of that well that's a,0.16878569
really difficult and potentially loaded question but I think the bigger culprit is the marketing,0.019095426
campaign for the film yes once again publicity kills another movie but there's a lot,0.10664091
more at stake this time than just entertainment value and when I say publicity I,0.03426361
mean the awards campaign but also the marketing for the general public because let's face,0.039186634
it seeing Selma based on the advertising material seems like a chore it seems like,0.06055566
a TV movie as I stated in my trailer review the poster is just the,0.029546127
back of Martin Luther King Junior's head I mean how uninspiring is that who says,0.21687116
that's the movie I want to see right now that's that's so totally a rental,0.036297742
and this is so not totally a rental type of movie and I don't understand,0.03650528
why a Hollywood Society and pretending particularly education system refuse to define Martin Luther King,0.042800575
and when you see this movie you see how horrible that is and how this,0.11607055
is a man who's been robbed of his legacy I mean forget the Oscar nominations,0.092225716
for the film the much bigger crime is that we do not remember what happened,0.03439199
here now this is a film that works on two levels and the first one,0.025543718
I want to discuss is its emotional qualities I haven't had this kind of an,0.040072657
emotional reaction to a movie since The Passion of the Christ and I recently detailed,0.0590111
what a strong emotional reaction I had to that film now The Passion of the,0.025724648
Christ still had had the bigger reaction and someone isn't quite at that level but,0.03614009
it's darn close and Ava Duvernay does an incredibly impressive job of not just humanizing,0.4596767
dr. King but his followers that's one thing that makes this movie truly special then,0.03517092
it's not just oh it was all Martin Luther King jr. it shows that only,0.096846744
and how his support team helped him but the people who risk their lives to,0.029019302
follow him and March with him and it shows the bravery of a non-violent movement,0.08209896
it's just it's incredible to watch and there are similarities to you know Jesus Christ's,0.040769104
sacrifice and he also turned the other cheek it's just incredibly powerful Oprah Winfrey has,0.08878073
an amazing scene with trying to register to vote it's just brilliantly done and then,0.049561504
the story of Jimmie Lee Jackson and his family will move you beyond words I,0.018144215
think everybody should know that man's name and the fact that they don't just once,0.031062081
again underlines how little attention is being paid to the civil rights movement and that,0.03224744
these memories are not being carried forward now I said this worked on two levels,0.022545734
so on one there's the emotional situation that you know hits you right out of,0.07270856
the gate I don't want to give it away but the movie made me jump,0.05297057
in one of its opening sequences it just rips your heart out fittingly you know,0.10674801
it's not sensationalized it's very real actually incredibly well grounded but then it's also an,0.029054556
amazing political film it reminds me a little bit of Lincoln where it shows the,0.031878926
backroom politicking and of course the movie shows what a brave person Martin Luther King,0.063466504
jr. was and what a great speaker he was but I've never before seen or,0.041099038
even seen and hinted that he was a great political tactician which he clearly was,0.030809976
and I can't believe that after having gone through the education system of this country,0.029903997
and you know being plugged into the media and celebrating a bunch of Martin Luther,0.04124538
King days no one has been able to explain to me until this film why,0.037950724
voting was so crucial to the civil rights movement and it's done eloquently here beautiful,0.046746448
and they really show the genius and why hundred years after the Civil War Martin,0.034737885
Luther King was finally able to find a way to crack this blockade that had,0.08573951
been put up by discrimination I mean it's just really really impeached of politicking and,0.08648651
it also underscores the importance of getting involved in your community and trying to work,0.037772454
within the system instead of just railing against it as I think sometimes people tend,0.05522022
to do and they're always unsuccessful and this movie shows that you're only going to,0.06298358
succeed if you wrestle with the Beast I know also LBJ a lot of people,0.2848449
have criticized this film for I'm not a good depiction of our former president I,0.030007765
think that's not true I think it's a very favorable depiction of LBJ as a,0.060455214
man of his times dealing with a very difficult situation and he had to make,0.037749838
the hard choices that again reflected the era that he lived in and the different,0.023083868
two different constituents that he deal with there's a great moment in the film where,0.008256924
LBJ points out that is an activist Martin Luther King jr. has only one cause,0.060942795
where he has a ton of causes that he has to deal with and I,0.040481746
think the film was in fact quite sympathetic to LBJ supposition and the way that,0.017342668
he and art Luther King jr. kind of do the dance politics is brilliant to,0.05562066
behold I also want to point out that I think that the reason that it,0.041371096
says that LBJ comes to the decision to do what he does in the end,0.023679208
obviously you know some people I could see would be like well that's not very,0.036986206
nice because you know he has a conversation with George Wallace and I don't want,0.053106267
to give anything away basically you know and she doesn't do it because it's the,0.03020466
right thing he does it because he doesn't want to be on the wrong side,0.036376234
of history but hey you know what that's a very realistic reason to be motivated,0.018361729
to do something and I actually found it quite refreshing to see such stark realism,0.0914275
in the depict of our leadership and you know I saw someone say oh this,0.0321011
is just gonna say Martin Luther King jr. was the saint I think this movie,0.0563517
was very respectful of him but it does acknowledge his flaws particularly a very big,0.043603454
one that he has within his family which you know I think another movie maybe,0.031195782
wouldn't have gone there but this one does and I think it's just it's impressive,0.038989075
across the board and I would say Ava Duvernay David Olo very talented here but,0.028715312
the real talent here is Duvernay and I think that she has the strongest voice,0.11779804
of all the creative voice and all the female directors working right now and if,0.07941428
she can avoid going too girly with future projects and she just continues to make,0.04812404
movies that are not gender specific like Selma I think she could go all the,0.077904314
way where's Kathryn Bigelow you know kind of fainted away after winning her Oscar and,0.07054871
you know hasn't really continued to work and been a you know someone who contributes,0.04370789
to the creative community of filmmaking I think do marinate you know she didn't get,0.028404672
a nomination here but I'm very excited to see what she does next so I,0.055588067
really recommend that you see this movie and I can see why you know people,0.07746396
maybe don't want to see it because again the marketing is so bad and also,0.050852623
this is a hard thing to take and people just forgotten about civil rights in,0.07703425
general I again I think it's appalling that I have learned so much from this,0.07461564
movie that I should have known beforehand and I can understand that it's a difficult,0.020347968
conversation to have and then it's people maybe just want to forget that this ever,0.022849724
happened that it was so soon it was just 50 years ago basically but you,0.024387628
know what you don't have to remember it all the time and we've made progress,0.03407137
and in some ways we haven't but if this movie really shows and underlines that,0.05850157
you know when you should remember all of this and you should honor not just,0.030215302
Martin Luther King jr. but his followers on Martin Luther King jr. Day and this,0.06540884
is a film that I don't even go so far as to say should be,0.043483056
played every year on Martin Luther King jr. Day just as they play the Ten,0.01905352
Commandments on Easter it's that powerful and I think it's that important so definitely go,0.055259466
and see it and I hope hopefully David oil particularly Ava Duvernay will get their,0.050457504
due on the next go-around so thank you so much for tuning in thank you,0.04513936
