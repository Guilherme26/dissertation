boy named Miguel who has a passion for music despite the fact that his family forbids him from playing it an attempt to follow his passion but Gael goes the search of his great-great-grandfather's

watching Miguel attempt to navigate his way through the land of the dead well he also attempts we figure out the truth of his family and his love for music okay so Coco was a film that was almost certainly expected to be great because Pixar very rarely misses the mark there's a few times where the work hasn't been great most particularly in the Cars franchise which everyone knows about but generally Pixar is expected to be the leader of the cinema animation industry and the bar has already set pretty high for most of their movies it sound like I was really blown away by the trailers for Coco I was definitely looking forward to seeing it but it wasn't like on my most anticipated list of the year or anything honestly though it probably should have been because this is one of the best films of the year thus far and easily the best animated film of the year thus far best that I've seen at least I think this movie offers what a lot of other Pixar films the past offer it's something for everyone I think you can take your kid to this movie and they'll certainly have a great time with it you could take your significant other to this movie and they'll have a good time with it how you could even take your grandma to this movie and she'd enjoy it too I think it balances all the things you'd expect to see out of a great animated film and turns all that into a really really well-rounded experience I think this is what Pixar does better than almost every one of their competitors I think a decent amount of adults are hesitant to go out and see an animated film because the primary target audience is generally kids and while that's still the case with Pixar films films like Coco will still get a lot of adults in the theatre because they offer really rich and emotional stories that carry adult themes as well I'll just let you know ahead of time the Coco is a very emotional film I mean I know the ending especially almost got me teary-eyed and usually pretty resilient with that kind of stuff I do know for certain that plenty of people in the feeder with me were crying because the lady next to me was and I noticed several others were as well but it's not like it's gut-wrenchingly sad it's sort of a happy sadness it's more emblematic of excellent storytelling than anything else this is very much a journey that you go on with Miguel and his companions and by the end of it the characters grow so much which is exactly what you're looking for out of this kind of film I think Coco separates itself from the recent pack of animated films because does not just feel good kid content it's actually a lot more than that and this story will resonate with people a lot longer than any generic animated film would but this isn't to say there isn't feel-good kid stuff too there definitely is but it's executed really well and never feels like it excludes the older audiences I think the way Coco approaches its humor specifically is actually really impressive because it doesn't necessarily favor one demographic over another it's kid driven first and foremost yes but there's definitely something here for everyone in the comedy department as well as other departments I found this film to have a ton of heart but I also found it to be very clever comedic Lee as well not a lot of kid films balance the two so proficiently but Coco is yet another Pixar film that pulls it off honest I think Coco is one of their best films to date because of how well this movie is balanced but from a technical perspective I think Coco really pushes the batteries of the genre some of the animation and this film is breathtakingly good and I really do love how each Pixar film looks better and better I mean this movie is so colorful and so beautiful to look at that it's almost worth going to see just for that I think the land of the Dead is honestly one of the most beautiful things I've seen in a film this year this is just insane animation and considering Coco is at least partially about music that's one of the big themes of the movie I think you'd be really upset if the music in Coco sucked but it doesn't it's actually pretty damn awesome actually do you want to give kudos to Michael Giacchino for creating an amazing soundtrack year the music and Coco is so versatile because there's moments where it's soothing and moments where it's exciting and energizing I think that it's really really great and this is probably another category where Coco ranks among the best of the year before we wrap up I just want to say that the ending of this film is so great it not only makes the whole journey feel worth it but it provides such a satisfying closure to the story of these characters it's really heartwarming stuff and hit me in the fields way harder than I expected - and that's how you know you're watching a great film I think ultimately Coco is a movie that excels at basically everything you'd hope it would and because of that I really do feel you should go out and see this one whether you're a big fan of animated films or not I thought it had a beautiful story about family and excellent balance of comedy and drama amazing visuals and some awesome music and as expected honestly there's nothing bad I can say about this movie I'm gonna give Coco a ten out of ten and recommend you go out and catch this one in theatres you won't regret it so did you guys see Coco yet what did you think of it and if not let me know why not and also let me know your favorite Pixar movie I'm gonna go with Toy Story 3 but there's so many good options that's all for now that this is willfox vacation signing off see you in the next review [Music]
