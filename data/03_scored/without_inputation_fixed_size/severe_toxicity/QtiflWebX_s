"family is found dead, the private detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, is hired",0.22352158
to solve the mystery. Thereís just something so satisfying about a well-crafted mystery. Whodunit films,0.065401524
are kind of a thing of the past. Weíve been having a mini resurgence the,0.03538112
"last few years, but classic murder mysteries donít really flood the theaters like they did",0.094065614

"screen with an all-star ensemble cast was an exciting one. And Knives Out really delivers,",0.030308427
providing us with a classic tale of mystery while maintaining certain more modern filmmaking sensibilities.,0.01055846
"I feel like Iíve been invoking Agatha Christie a lot in my reviews lately, but",0.04528437
thereís no way around it here. Not only is she the best-selling novelist of all,0.06149091
"time, but sheís arguably the best mystery writer of all time too. And as such,",0.028599571
her influence on modern storytelling is as wide-reaching as it is significant. Knives Out is,0.03306628
like an amalgamation of her greatest hits. Youíve got that classic murder mystery scenario involving,0.15343525
a large group of people in a mansion thatís straight out of And Then There,0.126639
"Were None. But unlike that story, itís not up to the house guests to solve",0.022847727
the crime. Weíve got a detective this time around which only further connects this particular,0.08786677
"film to the works of Agatha Christie. How you ask? Well, this filmís Benoit Blanc",0.08235972
"character is clearly influenced by Christieís own long-running detective character: Hercule Poirot, with both strongly-accented",0.021402285
"men proceeding with their investigations in peculiar ways, picking up on minute details and being",0.025383407
rather prone to exposition-heavy explanations. While these mystery genre callbacks might not be immediately recognizable,0.06565629

"no surprise that not every character is gonna have the same amount of screentime. But,",0.023818895
there were certain characters that I expected would have a larger role than they ended,0.018694986
up having. Thatís not a bad thing though. Not only did it allow for more,0.029126396
"focus on Benoit Blanc and his investigatory style, but it also prevented the suspect characters",0.06267427
from every getting too unlikeable. The family at the center of this mystery is a,0.19772251
diverse and eccentric bunch. Theyíre also the epitome of a dysfunctional family. They constantly argue,0.0861752
"and yell at each other, seemingly exclusively speaking in (at most) half-truths, and have zero",0.08979713
qualms about throwing each other under the bus. This interplay provides us ñ and Blanc-,0.109890334
with some valuable insight into the motives and personalities of the suspects and it was,0.025891608
"mostly played for humor, though admittedly it didnít always work for me. Mean-spirited familial interplay",0.12776515
"is never all that funny to me, though a lot of people in my theater",0.06674253
"were cracking up at it, so itís definitely just a weird personal preference of mine.",0.043811657
"So, while the family humor just wasnít there for me, that doesnít mean this wasnít",0.04640055
"a funny movie. For me, the most humorous bits all came from the two major",0.058082506
"characters that werenít members of the Thrombey family: Marta and, of course, Benoit Blanc. They",0.036968246
each had some very entertaining interactions with one another as well as the rest of,0.063691996
"the pool of suspects, resulting in a consistently humorous film with some great dialogue. Blanc",0.031028822
was an especially entertaining character and Daniel Craig did a wonderful job portraying him. He,0.025777197
"once again breaks out the southern accent and I have to say, it still throws",0.06333945
"me off, even after having seen Logan Lucky. Luckily, the oddity of the accent is",0.020838873
"short-lived and itís easy to buy into his character, especially with all the strange things",0.05303443
happening around him. Part of the fun of a whodunit film is to try to,0.06389421
solve the mystery before the characters do. The trailer was pretty enigmatic when it came,0.017257525
"to the murder mystery, but I had a theory in mind before even heading into",0.12788223
"the theater. Although my guess wasnít correct, I was pleased to see that at least",0.04602605
certain elements of it were. Itís always fun to be surprised by a movie like,0.07264338
"this one and it succeeded, not only with regard to the solution to the murder",0.3554255
"mystery, but also with its structure. What starts off as an entertaining, but fairly typical",0.047137573
"whodunit story, transforms into something more clever after some revelations that are made at the",0.053212695
end of the first act. Donít let that disappoint you though ñ thereís still plenty,0.10006358
"to enjoy about the movie after that, plus a few turns you wonít expect. Even",0.05429495
"with its more modern take and comedy-centric stylings, I think this would be a mystery",0.055537514
that even Agatha Christie wouldíve enjoyed. Alright letís talk about the pros and cons. Pro,0.08146903
number one is definitely Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc. The character is certainly modeled after,0.0128466915
"Hercule Poirot, but Craig brings enough charm and humor to the role to set him",0.028857661
apart. Well-crafted mysteries are no good if you donít have a character that can solve,0.028085385
"them and Blanc does just that in an interesting and frequently humorous way. In fact,",0.028640812
nearly all the moments in this film that I found to be the funniest involved,0.044448238
"Blanc and his interactions with other character. His methodical, yet odd way of approaching the",0.048580356
mystery definitely created a lot of friction with the other characters and produced some really,0.016706087
"good reactions, not to mention some incredibly funny dialogue. Blanc may end up being described",0.019483894
"as the southern Poirot, but just like Christieís famed detective, I would love to see",0.054571003
him return to solve another mystery. The second pro is the whodunit plot itself. Iím,0.070852704
a big fan of mystery stories and some of my favorite movies have mystery components,0.0096398415
to them. But having a good idea for a mystery doesnít necessarily equate to having,0.034473144
a well-executed mystery film. I would argue that itís one of the most difficult genres,0.10960497
to tackle cause not only does every piece have to fall into place in a,0.05531734
"way that actually makes sense, but you need to keep your audience invested the whole",0.013966196
"time. That means that they need to care about the story, but they also need",0.00791502
to feel like theyíre right on the cusp of solving the mystery too. Too simple,0.032511517
"and theyíll be bored, but too convoluted and theyíll get frustrated. Itís a difficult balance,",0.060384706
but Knives Out does an excellent job of both intriguing and entertaining the audience with,0.021198738
"a well-crafted mystery that Agatha Christie would be proud of. On the con side, my",0.058052573
"biggest issue was the family interplay. This is definitely more of a subjective thing, but",0.016218508
I just donít find fighting families to be particularly funny. Of course there was a,0.05809581
"bit of humor stemming from the family dynamics for me, but I have a hard",0.035017926
time finding such utterly unlikable characters enjoyable. Iíll concede that these arguments gave us some,0.12524277
good insight and clues with regard to the murder mystery at the center of the,0.08750757
"film, but it was still the least enjoyable aspect of the movie for me. Iím",0.042293042
gonna give Knives Out 4 out of 5 paws. Itís a darkly entertaining whodunit with,0.06682036
"a surprising structure, a stand-out cast, and more Agatha Christie homages than you can shake",0.0942532
a candlestick at. I would recommend Knives Out to anybody whoís a fan of mystery,0.07914688
"films. If you like classic whodunit murder mysteries in the vein of Agatha Christie, then",0.23385781
"thereís gonna be a lot youíll like here, especially regarding the mystery itself and how",0.064638555
it gets unraveled. If you arenít familiar with the older mystery style or donít like,0.047756195
"how dry those films could sometimes be, then this should still be a movie for",0.058839485
you thanks to its witty dialogue and very entertaining plot and characters. If you liked,0.01776772
"Knives Out, Iíve gotta recommend And Then There Were None. This is one of Agatha",0.048053533
Christieís most iconic mysteries and definitely serves as a plot inspiration for this film. Like,0.04929144
"Knives Out, the story is centered around a murder that occurs in a mansion full",0.10526465
of people in which everybodyís a suspect. This is a whodunit story in the classic,0.10657373
"sense, so it doesnít have the degree of humor we see with Knives Out, but",0.023719784
"itís still a really solid mystery. If you like the idea of that basic premise,",0.0344472
"but want something a little more funny and outlandish, you should check out Clue. Itís",0.050651073
loosely based on the Clue board game and is essentially a comedic spoof of Agatha,0.04659944
Christieís And Then There Were None. And if you want another murder mystery story with,0.14226483
"an interesting detective character, I would check out Murder on the Orient Express. Both the",0.10212431
"1974 or the 2017 version would do, but based on this movie, Iíd probably lean",0.02247057
"more towards the 2017 remake for its humor. In either case, itís another Agatha Christie",0.04387219
