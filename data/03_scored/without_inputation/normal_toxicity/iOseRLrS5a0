[Applause] everybody and welcome back to another movie night - movie review my name is Dalton Burdette and today we're gonna be talking about nineteen fifty twos singing in the rain this film stars Gene Kelly Donald O'Connor and the great Debbie Reynolds and this film was also directed by Gene,0.058919586
Kelly one of the main stars and Stanley,0.08499068
Donen this is a movie musical one of the classic movie,0.061236832
musicals but also the plot of this movie also just kind of,0.10888728
wraps its way into movie history which is the period of time where movies transition from being silent films to movies with sound or talkies as they were,0.07080063
called so it takes place in the late 1920s and it's sort of really about like this Hollywood stardom opening scene of this movie is,0.08158374
brilliant one of the great things about this movie is its excellent use of comedy and comedic timing and the way that it uses its,0.06429415
exposition and I really liked how there's a scene in this movie where these two characters you know gene Kelly's main,0.08984857
character,0.052153286
and one of the annoying co-leads who that actress was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress in this movie because she's so funny in it her name was a Jean Hagen in real life anyway they're being interviewed,0.18973169
and the interview is asking him like,0.05280069
I'll tell us about your story in your humble beginnings,0.0799664
and while he says things about how he went to this prestigious,0.13856074
you know school,0.09564882
and how he started off by doing dance classes here in acting classes,0.115988895
here,0.053441156
it's actually narration / flashbacks of what really happened in his life and it's him starting from it's like a rags to riches story but you've seen conflicting narration with what's actually happening to kind of show it not only sets the tone for what the feel of the movie is which is,0.08556562
comedic it shows his actual backstory and it gives insight as to how the you know Hollywood make a machine influences how you have to be in your public,0.08199958
persona,0.055547766
so it does just all of those things in one scene and it was such an awesome and interesting way to go about doing that and also speaking more towards the cast like Gene Kelly Donner will collar are great,0.034586534
but like Debbie Reynolds just what a national treasure Debbie Reynolds is like you're nothing,0.16178675
but a shadow on film a shadow,0.06168416
you're not flesh the musical numbers in this film are excellent,0.23960106
I think that it's not only just the quick choreography of the dance and lyrics of the songs,0.07260069
but also just the cinematography and direction of said musical scenes are really well done almost better than the actual scene themselves was just how the musical scene was filmed,0.05280301
and while the film does have a lot of really well working comedy,0.057141963
I think another great thing about this film is it's very deep characters and how each each character sort of serves its own purpose to the story but also is just a fundamentally different character you know gene Kelly's character is just you know the main lead who is really tired of being taken over by the Hollywood system,0.076993406
you have to be Reynolds who's an up-and-comer who wants to get into the Hollywood system,0.1392037
and you have Donna O'Connor's character who is also a hugely funny character whose role is to just be the best friend of Gene,0.04107861
Kelly,0.051732015
because they've been best friends since they were growing up and just also you know always play the piano be there,0.046565056
and just kind of be that guy that is the you know how about we do this,0.108808555
you know that guy like that there's a role in every friend group for that guy,0.09855596
and this is what he does,0.07094567
and I know I keep you know being repetitive saying how well the comedy works in this movie but this film is genuinely really funny and that's not something that gets talked about very,0.09153112
often when singing in the rain gets brought up since it's a musical beavers talked about the music this film is hysterical,0.21191473
but you have to in the bush try it again she'll get it textured,0.1238256
look cleaner don't worry we're all a little nervous the first day everything's gonna be,0.102808766
okay,0.050967902
oh by the way Rosco,0.08091029
you know the scene coming up where I say imperious princess of the night I don't like those lines,0.16989641
there is it alright,0.05676885
if I just say what I always do,0.05545639
I love you I love you I love you sure anyway it's comfortable,0.091806434
but into the bush okay again,0.06789833
why,0.051686183
but Dena we're missing every other word you've got to talk into the mic all right all right and also just since I'm a sucker for you know movies being about movies,0.48930043
you know seeing the silent to talkie transition happen and how Hollywood kind of freaks out and they take it more of a comedic route with it,0.3824071
but if that was just really fun to see portrayed in a sort of fantastical musical style movie and you know the few scenes where you get all three of them together,0.07085349
especially when they're performing musical numbers it's just it's pure cinematic magic it's wonderful as far for negatives about the film this film was only like an hour and 43 minutes long but it does feel its length at certain points or just means that there's an issue with the pacing and while it's not a huge problem,0.061946195
it is noticeable,0.067446366
and this movie does kind of do things for the sake of doing them,0.09643968
and not necessarily for the benefit of this story and look I understand the cinema of attractions I totally get it,0.053122763
but like there's a sequence where they have to rewrite one of their movies because it's just it played horrible it was garbage and they're trying to figure out how to fix this movie,0.49471214
and Gene,0.03576903
Kelly is like,0.06850226
oh how about I pitched this musical number and then it does the musical number that he's pitching to the producer and it's like it's the biggest musical number in the movie it's long it's extravagant and it looks beautiful,0.07548297
and it was extremely well done like,0.053550914
that's not the the point but but like we were in such an integral part of the movie and then it just like puts the plot aside and does this musical scene that is extremely long,0.047579978
and then it just cuts back to the producer and the producer is like ah yes great idea,0.070065506
and it's just like okay that that seemed just felt very misplaced to me,0.08848849
so I think just pacing and the you know very very small instances of style over actual substance of what's going on can really hurt the movie but not in a big way but it is noticeable and you know one more positive before I end it as I'll say this movie is very thematic alia,0.08000069
rich,0.04240451
you know the actual singing in the rain sequence,0.053454578
it to a point where the lead character is kind of having a rollercoaster of ups and downs throughout his career and you know that scene really comes about to tell just the you know underlying story of when you're dealt about hand when you have a bunch of horrible things happening around you when it's raining outside just sing just make,0.1502542
the best of what you have and eventually you'll find happiness out of that,0.093165144
and this movie does do a great job of reiterating that story in an underlying manner where it's not too in-your-face,0.13538086
and I like subliminal stories like that so overall I love singing in the rain,0.064571686
I think it's a wonderful musical movie,0.053972144
I think the numbers are great,0.042029608
I think the characters are great,0.037426367
the actors are great,0.066137955
however I do think it's pacing could be better,0.06669761
and there are some scenes that are just there to be there,0.041066844
and not necessarily serve to the story or the characters,0.04867032
but this is still a fantastic movie and I'm going to give singing in the rain in a thank you guys so much for watching,0.07368383
and we hope to see you soon [Applause],0.35337394
