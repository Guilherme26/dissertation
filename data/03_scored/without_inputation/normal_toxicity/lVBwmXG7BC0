as always for stopping by the channel,0.07071851
if this is your first time here welcome to the silver screen analysis I hope you like what you hear and decide to stay we have a highly anticipated movie to review in this video that being the second directed film from Jordan Peele called us starring Lupita Nyong'o Winston Duke Evan Alex Shahadah right Joseph the story and this one follows a family that's on vacation that in defining themselves being terrorized by the demented doppelgangers now it certainly isn't easy to follow up a massive critical success in a directorial debut with another movie that accomplishes the same if not more feats than that one,0.1788404
but I think that could be what Jordan Peele is sitting on with this movie because simply put I thought this movie was awesome,0.09957663
it was creepy,0.16200164
it was intelligent,0.1923701
it was just twisted and loads of fun,0.2641325
it was a perfect blend of horror and psychological thriller with dark comedy and together these elements just really fit nicely into one fluid narrative that took me on a very haunting ride with endless amounts of sinister appeal,0.1537543
I think the plotline in concept is very grounded,0.07406022
it isn't hard to put yourself in the position of this family to imagine what you would really do in their situation,0.09466937
I thought it was just absolutely compelling to see how things unfolded,0.11091221
the first act in particular the opening scene do a great job of setting the stage for this plotline,0.074747026
it gives us,0.065413564
this section of a flashback for this haunting night with this little girl it gives the viewer something to think about in the back of their mind,0.403118
as the tone then shifts to meeting the seemingly normal family the dynamics between them are all common to many other families their personalities were as well which I thought just made them very easy to connect with the dialogue was naturally charming with a great sense of humor it landed some solid laughs to keep me entertained and as things kind of built up but all the while you can just feel that something very dark and looming is foreboding in the backdrop of the story,0.06289963
I thought it was very effective in creating subtle uneasiness and I was constantly on edge waiting for something dark to happen despite the atmosphere of the movie early on being kind of light,0.08775325
and I enjoyed the contrast between both feelings it doesn't take long to learn enough about the characters to get a sense of they were and how their family dynamics were all structured,0.0597108
then the story really does take a turn the mood drops into a much darker territory the atmosphere instantly switches to that of being very ominous as the family's tethered twins make their appearance and from that minute the tension really does shoot up,0.15753944
and it doesn't waver for the rest of the runtime the scenes that progress from there where I thought equally as frightening as they were just steeped in a lot of just natural curiosity as to what was actually happening,0.087213114
and I thought that is where Pele really shined with his writing and his direction by weaving a story that was just very haunting and eerie but at the same time thought-provoking and honestly fascinating it was unpredictable and it took some appealing terms during the progression,0.038640786
it created some suspenseful home invasion sequences as well as some just pier flights for survival,0.106081955
the character tropes are all at first kind of delivered and a seemingly routine package but I thought throughout this story their arcs were swapped up just enough to create some fun certain members of the family I relied on four things to keep them all alive and it was kind of a breath of fresh,0.14843003
air to see some of the character tropes switched up a bit this added a ton of enjoyment to the already unique premise,0.05906514
and it gave just the entire film a fresh vibe to it,0.05104722
and I don't want to go into a lot of spoilers by speaking too much on the doppelgangers in this movie but I will say that the concept and then on paper was absolutely inventive they fit perfectly into the story to hit with pure frightening impact and it could not have been done without the excellent cast performances all the headlining actors had to play basically two versions of the roles that they took on and I thought each one of them knocked it out of the park with their performances,0.09839839
I thought Lupita Nyong'o was amazing,0.0997833
she captured both sides of her role to absolute perfection as this normal mother protecting her kids,0.14351109
I thought she capably hit all the emotion and intensity needed to just root for her success,0.20240027
and then as her dark and twisted twin she was even better with a haunting performance that I think is award worthy,0.51807064
I think she made this movie she was eerie and unpredictable and just what this story needed to create just a great demented protagonist the easily the other bright spots,0.29695106
in the cast were the performances of young Evan Alex and Shahadah right Joseph,0.06540767
I thought these roles really required a lot of range from them,0.055807576
and it was a pressive to see both of them pull off every needed angle of these characters,0.08044212
I thought Jordan peels Direction was excellent,0.096787006
it was an artistic,0.05459051
it was ambitious,0.08845315
I think he showed a very inspired eye behind the camera to really craft a fantastic horror film the production design and his methodical camerawork really blended together with a strong use of lighting in the movie and different angles to really build imposing scenes without the need for the usual jump scares,0.06428938
I think in this movie the horror was in the writing just as much as it was in the visual appeal and together the result was a success it really plants the seeds for some ideas early on,0.06617353
and then the final act it explores these concepts more to create just a world of thought I will be honest and say I think some of these layers could have been built a little sooner in the film but it was still well structured enough,0.07816149
in the closing act,0.067951046
to not feel rushed but it was very close despite that though I'm still gonna give us a solid 90 percent on the entertainment meter,0.060659777
I had a great time during this movie it was very entertaining,0.0842651
it was a blend of genres,0.07055305
but the focus was always on the horror,0.119066216
it was a movie that really did a good job of making you think about the big picture of the storylines actual setting the second act did linger just a little bit but it was very minor,0.077535205
also some of the attempts at humor kind of just felt missed timed,0.053271107
but I would have to say nothing to the extent of being distracting because I think everything else in this movie shined it was filled with natural characters that were able to really accomplish pulling off evil versions of themselves and with Jordan Peele riding and directing the tone of the story never lost,0.15139483
its intention of just being subtly horrific and it accomplishes that thank you guys,0.12563947
