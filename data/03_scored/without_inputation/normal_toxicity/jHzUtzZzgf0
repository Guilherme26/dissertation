he's supposed to it takes him a while to get there,0.08084339
but regardless she shows up in his life and he has to protect her and he asked to take her to freakin North Dakota even though he really really doesn't want to that's pretty much where the story takes off he meets his daughter clones trying to take care of her trying to save her while also trying to take care of Charles Xavier while also going on this crazy adventure,0.44825897

he used to say I cried a lot of tituba tears watching this movie and everything about it was beautiful Hugh Jackman's acting was obviously amazing,0.37682596
but this is probably the best he's ever been clang Wolverine he was just and and just the best he's been at being anybody,0.121276975
you had so much sympathy for him,0.10492311

and of course Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier just steals my heart I just want to hug him and Daphne can do plays Laura did a fabulous fabulous job,0.17971475
I'm always impressed when child actors just like kill it she was so good at being fierce and relentlessly murdering people and speaking of relentlessly murdering people the action in this movie is freakin crazy,0.794439
I am so happy,0.054897502
this has an R rating because the gore and just the violence in this movie is so awesome and so entertaining and so brutal also just shot beautifully like the action scenes are really well choreographed and really well shot and then the overall movie is just very gritty very kind of post-apocalyptic the way that old man Logan is supposed to be and very like sepia,0.2924441
it's just very gritty and very good very often and I love it,0.10228061
now I don't want to compare this to the comic because you know it is its own movie while it is based on the comic,0.10361628
I don't want to be one of those,0.1113056
people who's like a static the comics but like there are certain things that they change but I feel like didn't really benefit the story like Logan in this movie obviously has a lot of guilt for a lot of things that he did it's not even really specified exactly what happened,0.06578759
and I don't really want to give away any spoilers,0.09707124
so I'm not going to go into any more detail than that,0.07921268
but in the comic he's supposed to have pretty much killed,0.55195993
all the x-men just everybody he kills everybody and then he just feel so guilty about it,0.6643355
and that's why he was just like torturing himself and wanting to die the entire time during old man Logan and in this movie he feels all of those things,0.5002904
but there's not really any real justification for why he feels those things but it's just like I don't know it makes it so much less dark and I feel like it's already a pretty dark movie but it could have been even darker it would have been so awesome,0.15072387
we would have actually understood all of his guilt I guess that's just a nitpicky thing and I'll let it slide because it was so good seriously,0.17206277
I really really really loved Logan,0.089678966
it was a beautiful film even if you take it out of this Marvel x-men universe and just put it over here as its own separate film it's amazing just by itself standalone beautiful films but also an amazing way to and Logan's saga honestly couldn't of wish for anything better,0.11146284
