Star Wars the last Jedi for me was a very entertaining and very interesting film,0.061943546
I've been thinking about it ever since I saw it and I'm going to go,0.09276279
see it again because it was a movie that I walked out of it going,0.08735059
alright I can handle this and then the more I thought about it I was,0.047789287
like yeah yeah there was some stuff that they brought to the table with this,0.08009757
one that was a little bit different than what I was expecting this could have,0.08351574
been easily a rehash of the Empire Strikes Back or at least heavily inspired by,0.08365322
it in ways that the force awakens was heavily inspired by the original Star Wars,0.046143502
and every moment that came in this movie where I thought it would go that,0.064655975
way the movie just went nah Brownlee going over here you wouldn't expecting that boom,0.09687971
I thought the evolution of all the newer characters was really good he could to,0.05479934
sear a meeting face to face with Luke Skywalker ready to become a Jedi and,0.10993492
what you learn about her is that even though she's happy that she has these,0.11511978
Jedi powers she's also afraid she doesn't know how to deal with it she does,0.18354909
know how to control it she doesn't know her backstory of why she has it,0.15368767
or who her parents are and a lot of that troubles her and it also,0.10911514
troubles Luke because he's worried that because of these fears it could lead her to,0.092196524
easily get swayed by the darkside and he's already dealt with that with kylo Ren,0.13712056
he don't want to deal with that again and kylo Ren man I gotta give,0.16599536
him props he brought it in this movie I know people have their concerns about,0.08353375
him but the thing about kylo Ren is you can't look at him like he's,0.22256804
supposed to be the next Vader cuz he is not this is a guy that,0.14860596
is clearly emotional and he has some issues because he's had problems with his mentors,0.14977469
both in the light side and the dark and he's just very confused and conflicted,0.10580479
about who he's supposed to be with this power and then they showcase in this,0.05831463
movie that there's some kind of special connection between kylo Ren and Rey is almost,0.09220385
like a Jedi face time where they can just sense each other and talk to,0.11342822
each other when they're not even in the same area and at least some very,0.15834714
interesting conversations both want to have a better future they just want to do it,0.048073694
in different ways and they're both just like come on outside now you come on,0.10945635
my side you come over here you come over here it's like a big tug,0.40331236
of war is going my Jedi little war literally there's a scene that feels like,0.15367134
a straight-up Jedi tug of war like meanwhile you got poe dameron he's still flying,0.27670687
around the best pilot but he's getting a little cocky general Leia has to remind,0.4045444
him a few times that look you had done something awesome over here the first,0.10605481
order was over here with these 10 other people that you weren't noticing and just,0.10610739
killed them all so good job and there's this scene that takes place where they're,0.8437475
having this big space ballot at the beginning of the movie and I was thinking,0.15288815
like oh this is the cool big action show piece they put the begin of,0.082181774
the movie to get the action started right away come to find out that this,0.08052664
is actually a large part of the entire movie there is a resistance ship that's,0.081643716
pretty much the last of the people in the resistance and the first order is,0.11134501
on them and the resistance is in trouble they're running out of fuel they're running,0.15302981
out of power and they even have this new thing where I don't wanna say,0.112026274
too much but there's something that ships always been able to do to get away,0.094502755
that this time don't work first order got some newest a new GPS tracking to,0.09146108
figure out that even if you get far away from us using certain ways we,0.15074669
got you and then of course you had Finn he finally wakes up from his,0.14978218
coma the first thing he's doing he's like where's Rahab he knows that Rey is,0.15173897
away he doesn't want her to come back because he's afraid that she'll get in,0.311316
danger if she comes back here so he tries to find her so they can,0.13018169
escape and he runs into Rosa's brand new character who thinks that he's trying to,0.065939225
get away and at least this whole like Oh crazy dynamics but then they end,0.36523435
up becoming a pair that goes on his quest of their own and trying to,0.10209616
help everyone out and let me just say man I freaking love rose I just,0.24006428
love her spunk even though she does what she needs to do she gets her,0.6542482
job done there's just something kind of aura about her that kind of feels like,0.15945558
it feels like she won a contest like she won a contest to be in,0.09982434
a Star Wars movie like have a walk-on role but everyone just loved her so,0.07731531
much that she now gets to have a major partner movie like a dream come,0.15067954
true like I was just going to be an extra in the background because I,0.05850215
found the right piece of my Star Wars cereal and now I'm a main character,0.09772087
in this whole universe baby but yeah it's really cool to see her character in,0.09600788
this and her and Finn get along really well throughout the course of the movie,0.102708
nice a lot of the time together so it makes sense you also get a,0.07953794
little bit of story about her sister as well which is very quick but it's,0.14636892
very powerful like this one character her sister probably has more emotion than some of,0.10733793
the characters who are in the entire movie which is her one seed oh and,0.0760318
Finn brings it this time man hello jokey jokey I'm gonna run away you got,0.4620894
a boyfriend he is the fan I worn it like he even does something at,0.15015253
the end of this movie towards it into this movie that I was like damn,0.6364068
fan you have grown Randy Quaid would be proud hey stormtroopers I'm back the only,0.15098338
character I've never really been big on his general hooks that fleece hasn't even gotten,0.13302417
more and more out there but what I like about the movie is that even,0.06966622
in the movie nobody likes general Hux this dude is slapped around throwing across the,0.35529378
place made fun of and now I like him more for the fact that no,0.121326506
one in the movie treats him seriously but the classic characters are here too and,0.06039131
they're not forgotten and what I like about this movie is that they're not just,0.098860845
there for fanservice and nostalgia they actually try to do some evolution with some of,0.053146932
the classics like Luke Luke you would just think it's gonna come in as the,0.11095509
obi-wan role and just do his thing so that Rey could be the next Jedi,0.13509749
and that's it nah man Luke got some backstory that's a little like dude what,0.10937555
and it kind of could also have been the reason why all the stuff we're,0.04023594
dealing with now is happening and he always regrets that I thought that was kind,0.11980865
of cool and what's interesting about the story is one of those stories that you,0.035074975
get to hear a couple of times in the movie and you can hear it,0.06836481
from different perspectives so you see how each person feels about that moment and how,0.041944742
it looked to them and why they are acting the way they act now because,0.06418533
of what happened in their mind at that moment and lay a man Leia she's,0.20662601
badass Leia has gone full general and she also reminds you real quick remember I'm,0.2831984
a Skywalker - I know Luke got all these powers but let Lamport out of,0.12040653
power I was like damn I didn't even know Jedi could do that you thought,0.6423743
you've seen everything that the force could do this movie is like nah we got,0.09604143
some advanced level courses of force some advanced force courses that you need know about,0.07271465
and you bout to get a lesson son they got me two minutes I'm moment,0.29873163
in this movie I don't to give too much of my boarded that tear was,0.10412414
about to come down because I smell something about to happen and in that movie,0.16577703
was like nah nah suck that tear right back up you cool you cool everything's,0.7447261
good everything's good and Luke - boy Luke does something with his Jedi powers I,0.060844336
was like damn Luke doesn't thing whereas like you got this one time you'll never,0.8060606
see me do it again but when I did it this one time I hope,0.08287286
you enjoyed it and I was like I did I did Luke good job but,0.09710667
I tell you who I think really has a force in a ray and ain't,0.1490266
kylo Ren it's freaking bb-8 bb-8 is like Opie robot this droid can pretty much,0.39620873
do anything it is really the Swiss Army knife of Android especially towards the end,0.2398855
man bb-8 does something I was like what can't you do people talking about Rey,0.30329075
being over power uh-huh bb-8 people throw bb-8 in this movie like they throw him,0.3399639
he should break apart he's just like bounce like a freakin gummy bear like oh,0.69542736
oh my head fell out let me just go grab that real quick okay kill,0.82928115
bb-8 bb-8 is a terminator y'all baby is gonna come back in time and kill,0.84043
John Connor and we're gonna be ruled in the future by bb-8 and that's the,0.057783227
wrong I'm okay with living in as always the action is always on point in,0.100686304
these movies the space battles are good the lightsaber bat oh the lightsaber there is,0.15106168
a lightsaber battle in this movie that is so awesome man they even do something,0.082263045
with a ship in this movie that was like oh man I never would have,0.11985271
thought about doing that with a ship in Star Wars but when they do it,0.04974261
it is so awesome it is so awesome that the movie just stops doing sound,0.06626139
it's just like hey Nelson all right on the final act of this movie or,0.09339623
the final battle in this movie it's really cool it's not a Death Star this,0.10414446
time it's def storage but at least it's on the ground this time so we,0.05140633
get a ground fight there on this salt planet or this planet we're like the,0.1139428
white part it turns red so it has this nice visual to it it was,0.23999958
worth it we get some new creatures of course they're cute and adorable some of,0.13740908
them received you guys some of them are practical some are mixture of both the,0.06151672
poor you're not annoying I was really happy I was really worried about the pores,0.17193252
I'm like these become the Star Wars minions I'ma be a little bit upset but,0.10977493
they're actually really kind of cute I love the arctic fox things a little like,0.1321243
Crystal foxes those were awesome there are some other creatures are like yeah you know,0.18124886
they're okay some of them are there for jokes and humor there's a lot of,0.108898535
humor in this movie a lot more than I would've expected it's not like the,0.09986514
Star Wars Comedy Hour or anything but definitely more humor and more direct humor than,0.06917888
you would probably expect from something like Star Wars so for some people that might,0.08156142
be a bit hard to swallow some of the jokes I think did work though,0.31089434
some don't but some like there's this whole scene that takes place in the casino,0.12698416
and I know some people who have been really harping on this part I think,0.10145882
it's the worst I think there's some stuff and then it works some things that,0.12021467
don't work they get a little silly in there it gets a little jokey-joke but,0.44424602
at the same time I got a mic Sega Star Wars Casino I just thought,0.04148166
I was gonna meet and you know what got me and it's the lamest thing,0.36169183
in the world and I should put this as a bad but it was good,0.3158675
for me there's a character that literally in this movie is one of those rich,0.09407273
snobs people with the little tiny mustache and the white suit and the lapel he,0.26069933
just goes loving anybody ever says love me like that I'm like all right I,0.16213892
know I should not like you cuz that's cheap but I do but like I,0.3153665
said the big thing I can give credit for this movie is it is not,0.06640608
predictable at all all of you that created your Star Wars theories blogs and videos,0.24085884
and everything that you've created for the past couple of years about what you think,0.097136185
is gonna happen with Rey's parents if kind of rids gonna go full Vader the,0.15213352
origins of Snoke all that stuff you just might as well delete it just file,0.16309126
delete cuz this movie in there takes it a direction you never even thought it,0.2662854
would take or it just goes man that's not important you thought that was going,0.24229619
to be important in a sorry sorry did you waste your time she just went,0.3239522
to the movie came out like everyone else did that's your fault one of the,0.16943231
biggest problems I have with the movie is that all the carriers that I like,0.088544406
are split up so Rey has her thing going on with Luke Finn and Rose,0.08937722
have their thing going on Poe has his thing going on with Leia and then,0.08069068
kylo Ren kind of pops in with Ray every once in a while and I,0.16016442
get why they did that because they have so many different things going on with,0.064647704
this story but one of the things that made the force awakens work for me,0.07192447
was I loved the chemistry between Finn and Poe I love the chemistry between Finn,0.06669756
and Rey the fact they're mostly split up for this entire film you kind of,0.1530062
miss it a little bit that's why I'm glad they had been Andros together because,0.15447094
they kind of brought back that chemistry that I was expecting based on what I,0.06962572
saw with Rey and Finn and Finn and Poe in the force awakens plus their,0.07099098
plot points aren't even they're all good storylines but some get a little bit more,0.15057513
detail than others some are put on the screen a little bit more than others,0.09477771
because we get back and forth like five or six times of Luke being like,0.052323125
I'm not gonna train you rain I'm like do we know you're gonna train us,0.119705535
just go ahead and do it we already keep coming back here for you to,0.08829992
say no and there's some things that happen with poet it made sense there was,0.050789595
a couple times I was like you probably could have just had a conversation with,0.084727295
him Laura Dern and then we probably gotten this all cleared up meanwhile Finn and,0.103491016
Rose are sort of establishing this relationship as a duo together it kind of gets,0.060447272
established through dialogue but I think we would have been nice to see more of,0.06244735
it they kind of get a little excited when they get that Casino is like,0.07038924
all the CGI listen looking at that we got to do all this stuff to,0.07719104
make it all fun and I get it because the kids are coming to you,0.1565492
gotta give some to the kids but I love those two characters together and I,0.056003362
think they were establishing something great with them and so I wish that their story,0.061350383
was beat up a little bit more the movie is fine with its link but,0.13978747
I think it could have either been a little bit tighter or it could have,0.23970132
just balanced out a little bit more you balanced out the force let's balance out,0.112239875
the plot points and there is a character that casino I was like come on,0.08370834
y'all that's a leprechaun don't go back to that I'm not going in there with,0.32091868
two Jedi Knight type of Star Wars characters okay we do that in the prequels,0.04983663
don't do that again the movie has a mix of practical effects and CGI effects,0.06999851
which is fine but that just means that some of the CG eyes don't look,0.09416988
really CGI when you see it but I gotta give them props man because there's,0.08114974
something they could've done CGI that has been done CGI before that wasn't CGI before,0.06879959
that and they couldn't CGI again and they chose instead to go back to practical,0.065818176
and I was like wow that's bold and some of the lessons that they try,0.06651151
to put in this movie are a little heavy-handed they try to do some things,0.19656825
about the rich living off the poor the casino scene there's a whole talk about,0.23585899
weapons and how they're handled on both sides and it's like nah man I get,0.10128741
it you want to put your lessons in there but a little on the nose,0.17279236
poor captain phasma man it's like she just had such a great outfit and a,0.4096091
great demeanor and you just wanting her to shine she gets like a scene it's,0.3386967
a really good scene but it's a scene Acy but at least captain phasma does,0.17320813
better than Maz Kanata little Lupita Nyong'o they need to get rid of her CGI,0.42650485
character and just make her a character in the movie like the actress not only,0.09334248
is she in one scene she's like in like a little viewing globe like we're,0.12027784
in the freakin Power Rangers command center and we're watching Zords globe and she's in,0.60474306
there like hey I'm gonna tell you some exposition and then I'm out I'm off,0.11797325
the Black Panther seriously like is she like going to cocoon and like metamorphosis Maz,0.3118032
Kanata going to cocoon and come out as Lupita Nyong'o as a human can we,0.24018744
just do that do that in episode 9 and now for the nerdy is Star,0.34025258
Wars done and I'm pretty sure there's gonna be some hardcore Star Wars fan boys,0.10246912
they're not gonna like this movie because some characters gonna not gonna do the things,0.10285506
they thought they were gonna do some storylines not gonna go the way they thought,0.09934444
they were gonna go their fanfiction is completely ripped up and shredded and burned and,0.47142988
to that I say who needs your 3d glasses when you got nostalgic goggles you,0.3154823
like the movie fine if you don't find these are my opinions is how I,0.12140951
feel I enjoyed it wish it could've been structured a little bit tighter but I,0.19007923
still enjoy what I saw but what I really respect about it is a movie,0.07849331
that made me think and it's a movie that I want to see again because,0.13038328
it made me think so much and that is not something I would have expected,0.071886286
from Star Wars The Force awakens was more of the funnest I'll just throw back,0.10204093
this is more of a thinking man Star Wars for me and I appreciate that,0.08237663
they went in that direction so those are my thoughts about Star Wars let me,0.059293184
