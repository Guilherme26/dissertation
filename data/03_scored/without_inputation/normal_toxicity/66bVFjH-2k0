so do you have to leave home to love home hello everyone and welcome to movie reviews by Josh,0.10745097
my name is Josh Terry and today I'm gonna tell you about a little indie movie called ladybird,0.15874344
and it's not a sequel or a companion to LBJ because his wife was named ladybird,0.26224333
actually it's kind of a coming-of-age story about a teenage girl in 2002,0.11175196
therefore it is a period piece,0.12895805
wrap your head around that about a teenage girl senior in high school and she's getting right to go to college,0.31169885
and she hates where she is at and she is at Sacramento,0.49096626
that's where she's grown up but she wants culture she wants of AI brron steam wants community and enthusiasm and excitement,0.1728312
and so she wants to go to New York to go to college because New York is the only place that has culture right,0.10189466
that's like Chicago what's interesting about this is it kind of plays with a little bit of a little bit of a stereotype kind of a East Coast elitist type of thing and Lady Bird is played by sushi Ronin,0.1195521
that's actually the name of the character,0.049914453
technically it's the nickname because her real name is Christine but she wants every to call her Lady Bird because she's at that one little spot in adolescence where you're aware of your own intellectual capabilities but you're not wise enough to really know what to do with yourself,0.31089434
and so she's kind of in this really agitating stage where she's smart but also really really annoying,0.43775493
and so this movie is really about her just kind of navigating the the ups and downs of her senior years she gets ready to head off to college,0.23995699
and she she's kind of boy-crazy and so she falls in love with this kid Danny from her acting class,0.6049651
and then when things don't work out there,0.06734726
she goes after a bass player in a local band who's a conspiracy theorist and this kind of thing and this this movie and put it this way if Saoirse Ronan is performance wasn't so warm and quirky because Lady Bird is kind of quirky as well as annoying this movie drive,0.24882743
you crazy as an adult I guess from the perspective an adult because there the movie really kind of brings out the the foibles and the absurdity and the weaknesses of late adolescence and kind of when you think you know everything and you don't so from an adult perspective this kind of interesting movie to see it's kind of one of those things,0.59683216
that's it's fun to watch but it's also painful to watch because it brings back memories,0.09225354
and I I want to be given this one it could solve three stars out of four this is from Greta Gerwig,0.094192676
and it's got it really kind of a clever script you know it's it's pretty funny,0.120349154
it's not quite as riotous as I was just when I went to see this movie there were people who were practically almost literally falling in the aisles with laughter and I thought you know it's good,0.099692926
it's not that funny people I don't know so who knows you might find this completely life-changing,0.25071648
I found it three stars out of four life-changing,0.06956315
so whatever if that's worth the movie is rated R,0.08576057
it's a little bit annoying because it didn't it's got you know a handful of f-bombs here and there so it's mostly language at one point in order to kind of celebrate her 18th birthday,0.38217926
she goes and buys a dirty magazine Playgirl magazine and so you actually see in the magazine and so that's kind of where the the nudity comes from so be prepared for that,0.26605505
there's also some sexual experimentation with her boyfriends which doesn't really get too graphic or anything but so it's I don't vote call it a soft R,0.49983034
but it's R enough to be concerning if that's kind of an area where you are concerned so are teenagers just the worst leave your answers in the comments below so thanks for watching,0.18097398
