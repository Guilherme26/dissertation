hello there welcome to Brian IMAX movie talk and my review of rear-window a film from 1954 which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock of course,0.10654345
and the screenplay was written by John Michael Hayes,0.07721737
now both of these were nominated for Oscars for this film and both lost quite rightly I think in the case of Hitchcock,0.12495154
because yeah my one of my favorite films of all time won that year on the waterfront,0.07081266
and John Michael Hayes lost out to the country girl,0.23981714
yeah exactly who remembers that one I don't know not me,0.09792087
I'll tell you that much alright but both worthy nominees,0.09886706
it must be said,0.0549246
now this film is pretty high up in the IMDB top 250 and it is not hard to see why there is not much I can fault if anything to be honest,0.105594784
it follows this character played by Jimmy Stewart who is again excellent in this film and he's a photographer and he's basically been bound to a wheelchair due to an accident,0.19106257
that's happened,0.054679196
so he Wiles his hours away just looking out the window kind of peering into the lives of his neighbors,0.24762508
and yeah he thinks that he's cutting on to a murder that happened,0.5154597
he doesn't necessarily witness that murder,0.26002756
but the things he's seen the behavior patterns,0.05950168
he's witnessing leads him to believe and his girlfriend that a murder has taken place has it Oh hasn't it film has a lot of fun,0.24761172
it must be said of dealing with that question getting to the bottom of this mystery and I love that we never see that murder,0.25393093
I love that the question of whether he did or he didn't he's always hanging in the air,0.1515636
until we get to these it to the finale to we find out the the answer to that question we in that sense a pot into Jimmy Stewart cheers we're going along with this mystery as its unfolding through his eyes Grace,0.079876475
Kelly is also fantastic in this it must be said,0.08103053
she won an Oscar for this she was nominated and she did win and deservedly,0.14483777
so I think yeah really great performance,0.062455628
and one of the greatest cinematic kind of introductions for a character,0.073939905
I think the way she comes in out of focus,0.1564714
you know she starts her opening shot,0.5154597
she stats out a focus,0.1504648
she kind of leans over Jimmy Stewart's character and again we see it from his eyes very much how this film plays all the time seeing everything through his eyes and she comes into focus and it's just yeah she's striking the beautiful clearly but she also proved herself with this film to be quite a formidable actress quite a talented actress Thelma Ritter is also really good Stella,0.096527
she's this woman who kind of comes in and does housework the Jim Stewart's character and yeah she just has a very kind of dry sense of humor shall we say dry wit and she has this into her character has this interest in like serial killers the this kind of thing so she brings a little bit of import to proceedings that is a bit on the more humorous side like I say very deadpan at the same time yes she just adds another dynamic to this this core group of characters these two characters screenplay by John Michael Hayes is brilliantly executed,0.25055462
yeah just the way he pulls out particular characters and details and obviously the way Hitchcock directs that on the screen it's just a beautiful marriage between director and writer and obviously the actors as well I'm just bringing those details out and and building up this picture of this world just outside your window,0.0843023
yeah you know it's one of the things that this film is about it's this idea that actually there is this whole kind of system of life going on just outside your window,0.06893963
you can get caught up in the minutiae of of everyday life and never really notice what's going on you have,0.18020077
all these little stories going on inside these windows and there are stories that kind of play out in such a way that it acknowledges,0.07549829
the fact you don't have the complete picture,0.13053888
you know you can look into someone's window you can see something happen and you can get the wrong idea,0.1535216
you can build a picture in your head of what is going on in that person's life,0.35452935
and by the time we get to the end of this film we see that in,0.06864028
many of these cases,0.06818193
that's not the case you know,0.0914892
what you think was happening,0.07767515
or what Jimmy Stewart's character thought was happening,0.05019243
isn't the case,0.063861586
and I think that's the way it is with life,0.081511155
I think what it is saying ultimately is that how much do we really know about our neighbors and how much are we to blame for that you know we don't I think particularly today,0.10257178
it's probably never been more relevant this film because how many of us can truly claim to know our next-door neighbors you know I think I think a lot of us know people or within the online community better than we do our own neighbors,0.054927513
so yeah I think that's something that this film taps into long before social media which would probably existed back then just not to the extent that it does now as with all Hitchcock films is a pretty good dose of humor in here as well and it really works it works very well and it's mainly down to Kelly and Stuart and just they're in to play,0.05800462
I totally believe in these characters the way they've brought them to life,0.14721441
and yeah I just really enjoy every moment of this journey going along with these two people they feel like people I would like to know in real life,0.14123346
you know there's there's nothing about them that kind of makes me shut down makes me turn enough and there has been in a few of Hitchcock's films not here like I say they they make these central characters absolutely believable and absolutely lovable,0.19032316
and I think that's very important given the amount of time we're gonna spend with them because we never really leave that apartment,0.07853952
you know everything,0.08235927
we see in the outside world,0.06104419
we see from that apartment,0.054779243
so yeah you have to make these guy these characters like especially Stewart's character and they succeed with that something else that is really great about this film is the production design now that they built all this block of apartments and many times throughout,0.091705985
- you're looking at it you're seeing the set and you're honestly you forget that you're watching a set this,0.09467928
times,0.031401332
when you look at it and you like yeah it looks like location filming and you have to remind yourself actually no it isn't this was all done studio every last bit of it was built,0.08063573
and it's just brilliant absolutely brilliant,0.067532144
and if you look at behind-the-scenes stuff on this they're the studio where they built this set they actually took out the middle floor just so they could get that depth,0.07679854
you know so they could get like two or three floors worth of building on there,0.09791174
so yeah it is it is an amazing feat,0.06926142
it must be said,0.054924626
and the physicality of it you know like these days,0.07142657
you do something like this,0.15698177
you probably employ CGI,0.069829375
you know to you need to kind of you get a little bit of the stage and then you'd map the rest out with with computer graphics build it up so to speak but here it's all real,0.08884104
there's no green screen in that regard and you just yeah you can feel it,0.06794642
you feel like you can reach out touch it and live,0.24246964
with these people all these people that you're seeing in these apartment blocks,0.15375358
he's absolutely brilliant,0.12629925
Hitchcock's direction is brilliant the way he like I said the way he moves the camera across these blocks kind of focuses in on very specific information giving us what we need to know just enough to keep us on tenterhooks to keep us gripped with what's going on never knowing all the facts but just enough to keep sucking in,0.4985551
so yeah if there's one downside,0.12541887
and this is very minimal really it is it's it's towards the end of the film,0.07714497
and it's the final confrontation between Jimmy Stewart's character,0.07556349
and this guy it doesn't really play all that well or believable these days you know Stewart uses his carrot his camera should say the flash on his camera to kind of yeah push this guy back every now and then just like phase in it's just to hold off his attack really and the amount of times the sky falls for him,0.18364786
without just saying you know I'm going to close my eyes and come for you you're in a wheelchair,0.4343376
how you know how difficult is it going to be to subdue you,0.15416716
yeah that doesn't play too well by modern standards,0.059571035
but like I say it's such a minor criticism,0.08829304
I I'm literally struggling there to to come up with that just so I've got something to criticize neither not i thing you have to quit if somebody wanted to yeah that's a little thing,0.08903748
but for the most part I can understand why this film is so loved by people,0.09229206
it's still not my favorite film of 1954,0.09106451
I've got to say upon the waterfront,0.09992899
I love so much but yeah this definitely definitely comes a very close second,0.068567365
so yeah rear window I give it a 5 out 5 III think it's yeah really incredible piece of work and I strongly urge anyone who hasn't seen it to go out and see it if you have seen rear window then as usual I would like to know what you thought about it comment,0.19059274
below,0.07633601
let me know your thoughts until next time crack,0.388389
it,0.046851434
