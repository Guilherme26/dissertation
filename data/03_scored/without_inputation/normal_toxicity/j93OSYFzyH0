now I saw this film in the theater on purpose,0.11316549
I intentionally want to make sure I paid money to see it because I want to support the message that it is okay to make a black film that is not about slavery or any other kind of servitude or oppression to have it be a success IE 12 years a slave lee daniels the butler the help nothing wrong with those films,0.21191539
i think they are great,0.054242585

what's out so much happening,0.09045906
if that makes sense moonlight isn't a film that overthrows you with so much dialogue or too many subplots it's smart and quite simple,0.18221414
in fact there's a boy becomes a man,0.18977603
and all of the in-between is completely sheltered in his mind,0.24409789

in three acts little boy young man grown man all the same person but somehow different,0.13444306
we as an audience go on this journey with our protagonist sharone and we learn things about him as he does it's all done very subtly and the film takes its time which is very abstract and rare in this day and age of hollywood everything is always,0.058785506
now now now and exciting moonlight is careful and delicate and it forces you to be so as well to be honest,0.09694101
we need that sometimes I particularly appreciate that pacing because it leaves space for us to understand these characters and see ourselves in them as well as interpret what will happen based on the little nuances,0.13403809
it leaves us with this film treats,0.08856365
its audience with dignity and shows us how we genuinely are,0.053702105

and the filmmakers made this script compelling without contrivance contrivance contrivance contra mints the lighting in this quiz below the lighting the lighting,0.09002179
this is always better for me to read it that actually try to remember things because it's not going to be a structured as when you write it the way they use colors here is amazing the music is also super dope and actually puts you in the setting of role Florida as well as make you feel the heat of the area,0.23160036
I said the same thing about Mississippi damn the film is extremely tense,0.49891636
and it makes you tense watching it,0.07661947
I love it in conclusion what we have here is a beautiful telling of a coming of age story with wonderful performances across the board every actor here is fantastic,0.10634586
I expect nominations I wrote this before the Golden Globes came out by the way I rolled this November 26 2016 nominations came out I think a few days after a week,0.08135692
after the cinematography is on point with the way they use color to highlight the tone of the scene the scoring for the score is the score and screenplay are on point the score and screenplay are intimate subtle silent and intense moonlight is a narrative character story about a real person and it feels very lifelike,0.06391652
sometimes silence is very loud,0.105950564
you can say a lot by not saying anything at all,0.10617354
I cannot wait to watch from,0.10510444

now today but I can't PS for some reason this film reminded me of Frank Ocean,0.06501478
I know I'm not alone in that because I saw someone else write that online somewhere that it's like a mixture of something,0.11529809
and Frank Ocean was another review that I saw online someone else wrote that I wanted to share because I thought it was it invite it embodied everything that I thought about moonlight,0.076771595
see here it is,0.052221544
the thing about Frank Ocean someone says to put it in the most reductive too tantalizing terms possible,0.15076162

and if you like Carol you'll definitely like wait ok this review I'm going to read it this is from Eli Hayes on letterbox,0.203306
this is what he said he gave it five stars the hype has never ever ever been so real and the best birthday present that I ever could have asked for it's funny because I saw them with you to a a marvel a modern master work of on adulterated understanding understanding of isolation of the video cut off before I could finish,0.14695941
what I was saying about the online review that I saw them in moonlight so I'm gonna finish that,0.14229685
now I believe this is where I left off understanding of isolation of Indian do synchronicities understanding of care of compassion understanding of darkness and disparities of spectrums of sexuality understanding of memories,0.20410013
and maliciousness of forced numbness of nostalgia understanding of catharsis catharsis they said it twice,0.16987944
the third act of this film is nothing short of the puree shaping and structuring of cathartic cinema one of if not the finest sophomore features of the last half decade a miracle of film a miracle of a film and experience which we are blessed to have exists in our current rapturously unsympathetic reality the reason the phone is disclosed to because I'm blind,0.09047253
I can't say can see,0.07397453
