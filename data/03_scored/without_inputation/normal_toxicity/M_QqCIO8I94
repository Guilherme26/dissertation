hi everyone welcome to another pretty cat movie review are we talking about the film and she'll be the tough credit with the final critique the let's go the film journeys with Martin Luther King jr. as he leaves the prevalent march for equal voting rights starting from Selma to Montgomery Alabama,0.04653812
but I looked into it and the film was directed by female director a month ever nay but also intrigued me in it I decided I needed to support feature friends like this that are widely released let's do this review here we go before I go into the story,0.08541063
please let me commend the awesome acting the brilliant acting from the leads and the supporting actors in this film david o,0.07880896
yellow really brought up the passion and the struggle that martin luther king gave him his speeches at Zama to the point where i was watching the film i thought why aren't we cutting why are we cutting in between speeches it could carry,0.06779512
what would just one cut because of his energy because of his focus and because of his performance in the film what topped that was when David no yellow and Carmen ejogo were together in a room Allah the tension the stress the love of the hurt the pain all of it through that relationship between those two was shown beautifully and subtly through the dialogue and how it was delivered,0.108892046
I was enthralled when these two may be seen together it was just so captivating,0.07411215
I wanted it to keep going I wanted to see more about the relationship and more about what they were fighting for in terms of their love in their marriage,0.102760635
maybe just they get it,0.049350046
so perfectly,0.045042064
I felt like I was cheated at the end of the movie when we didn't go more into their relationship,0.08996383
and that was great to expose Martin Luther King more as a person as opposed to the leader is a great choice,0.15757051
but sometimes the film went from Martin Luther King's journey and Selma to just the civil rights movement as a whole and it kind of jumped sets of facts some stuff,0.074149884
we didn't even really need,0.05850276
and the story was solid in that it went step by step about the process of the campaign and it went deeper and deeper into Martin Luther King's character where it showed him broken defeated sad and appoints cowardly,0.55489004
and that was also a different view of Martin Luther King that we haven't seen or some points in the movie where they showed facts and characters that wasn't really necessarily directly involved with Martin Luther King or the march at Selma and it kind of brought different aspects of the film that weren't needed and I didn't much care for it,0.03088193
it really actually took me out of the film and I feel like it's they tightened up on the plot and the story and the characters it would have been a hundred hundred times better,0.05534054
the focus was kind of spotty at some points throughout the plot but like I said it was a strong solid story and it kept me intrigued to see where us this March is going and how and exactly and it was a very entertaining powerful and emotional thump the like I said we're finally down to miss pretty cats movie more of you here,0.0631696
she is go for you mmmm yum yum yum yum yum yum and there you have the fun review for Selma we'll see how it doesn't the Oscars,0.15447162
but like I said even though I had a few different topics that was kind of pulling it away from the plot,0.07762867
I really enjoyed it powerful passionate inspiring movie,0.06945405
and I would recommend that you should see it thanks again everybody down in bye,0.2967747
