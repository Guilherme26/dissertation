hi and welcome to rouse the view this video is part of my office special,0.08911862
where i'm going to be reviewing this youth restful nominee and today i'm going to,0.06701679
be reviewing arrival arrive of the science fiction film that's all of the story of,0.05744545
a linguistics expert played by any Adams whose job is established communication with aliens of,0.091729455
just landed on earth the clothes directed by denis villeneuve who also directed Sicario and,0.077652425
prisoners i am personally a big fan of prisoners i think for the most underrated,0.13537435
movies ever so going into the summer i had high expectations because the director is,0.03104081
so talented and does such beautiful work so going into this film on has very,0.099456176
high expectations and i must say that i enjoyed arrival a lot and i wanted,0.07668379
to be very intriguing so once again and start talking about the selling things that,0.060913824
i liked about arrival number three the vigil this film looks absolutely gorgeous i really,0.12351659
like the cinematography i thought it was beautiful and i really like the production design,0.082655415
and the design of the aliens endless space ship I was very unique and refreshing,0.071536064
and I really enjoyed and thought it to be very creative and even though you,0.09280305
expect from something like this to be big and huge it's still sold in a,0.10042827
very confined small space and I found it very interesting in claustrophobic it helps increase,0.093505844
the tension of the film and it helped establish the mood of these people who,0.048845056
are under pressure to establish communications with these creatures so he's also anxiety and you,0.11352247
from the pressure that was on the characters which was very interesting and it was,0.028864916
established very well the number two thing I liked was the sound this film is,0.062053457
very unique sound design that I don't think you're going to get appreciated much accessible,0.08475632
people who pay attention to this kind of stuff a lot of times in science,0.1438358
fiction the sound design becomes larger than life because it's trying to manipulate you into,0.12737516
feeling a certain way it tries to make you feel anxious or feel the pressure,0.063857205
or the tension of the science fiction world however the sound design here felt a,0.024869451
lot more subtle and itself and was organic like it came from the world of,0.07076497
the film and it really helped establish the mood this is mostly evidence in the,0.031003887
scenes where the humans and aliens are trying to communicate and the sound design in,0.15161315
those things is pretty masterful I realize this when the score came in and I,0.0803183
also like it when the score wasn't there the big moments of silence really important,0.18336484
to the film and really important for the mood of the song so it was,0.028158795
a very successful sense in terms of songs are the number one thing I like,0.043746818
about rival was the script this is a loaded topic because I liked a lot,0.060222343
of things about the trip to arrival I think the most powerful thing about the,0.055914316
whole movie is the script starting from the concept itself were these humans are trying,0.067040674
to communicate with creatures that don't use language and the form of communication so the,0.06974429
film studies the art of communication itself cancer very powerful concepts talk about and think,0.10680003
about also this story is being told in sort of a non-conventional nonlinear way and,0.061290946
its really interesting in the beginning it feels a little mysterious but once the story,0.035923447
starts to install further and you kind of figure out what is going on it,0.08613055
catches you by surprise and I all yeah not so that means and I found,0.18214126
that to be very interesting and unexpected I didn't see and the flood twist that,0.027287787
eventually came coming and this is a really strong way of script writing and storytelling,0.067124076
where you try to tell the story in a different way from a different angle,0.054084904
I stayed if we would say that what i like about science fiction is one,0.07459446
jump start asking questions about humanity itself when trying to discover things about another race,0.2415001
or another world we start discussing things about ourselves and discovering things about us as,0.09500488
a human race and it's a very powerful concept it was always nice to study,0.13136315
the film is more contained and small don't expect an Independence Day here it's more,0.07895305
science than fiction and it's more about us as human being it's kind of like,0.13304028
contact what's better and it's also kind of like sign but better the script also,0.03967395
has a bunch of twists and turns so there's some kind of meat processing you,0.31089434
don't really know what to make of it when it first ends however it needs,0.06977528
a few rewatch is later for you to kind of grasp what you just saw,0.27173525
this movie wasn't a perfect film so let's start talking about the top three things,0.11417378
I didn't like a motorized nervously Jeremy Renner's character I like Jeremy Renner a lot,0.14926748
and he's a great actor and this character was interesting missile however from Midway onwards,0.17663622
I thought that his character was kind of unnecessary his relationship with Amy and has,0.06603769
been seem that interesting to me and also him as a character didn't seem to,0.10557625
contribute much to the cause later down the line even he himself comments on a,0.09775572
thing i'm doing here and i as an audience members felt the same way what,0.058152776
are you doing here you're not really contributing much so i thought that he was,0.17971385
there just so we can have someone for any atoms interact with and just to,0.041167594
have somebody who give the some exposition my texts that looks deserve as exposition on,0.1407343
our characters that are important that I feel are necessary for the story the number,0.030404678
two thing I didn't like was the pacing the tendon was very high which was,0.05234183
really cool but sometimes the sylphs no done a little bit too much and can,0.2723607
kinda get boring there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and there was a lot,0.14921398
of exposition things we just can't just sit around and explain stuff they wouldn't have,0.07486322
this conversation if there wasn't a camera an audience watching them so those things didn't,0.05571335
really work for me and also we spent a lot of time before we got,0.06772573
into the action before we got to any cloud progression the number one thing I,0.032070927
didn't like about arrival was the aliens purpose throughout the marketing campaign of the film,0.0708571
as the one the film itself the big question is why are they here but,0.047354374
like I said that some focus is a lot about the humans and towards the,0.06903805
end until the focus becomes more about the humans and less about why the aliens,0.16047423
are here and the reasoning behind all of that didn't really make sense to me,0.076483734
and I didn't feel like it was strong enough it's possible that i need to,0.060890943
go rewash the subsidizing kind of grasp the justification that we were given at the,0.08783881
end but coming out of the films I didn't feel satisfied with that answer and,0.07576821
I thought it was very important to be satisfied by that answer because that was,0.05478342
the big question that was asked in the beginning and that's why its my knee,0.086839706
straightest thing about the film I came up with some liking it a lot but,0.068047516
still asking myself at a I don't care I Daniel awesome so although I thought,0.1453806
arrival was intriguing and very unique film and definitely one of the better science fiction,0.03936745
films to come out in the last couple of years and I really really enjoyed,0.0995349
it even though some of it didn't work for me overall I found it to,0.0776983
be very good and for that I'm going to give it an eight I don't,0.088525236
know what's up the chances are but if I have to say something is a,0.053042892
strong competitor it would definitely be the script and the sound design so have you,0.047169764
