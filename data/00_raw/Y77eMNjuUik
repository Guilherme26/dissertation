the movie poster for book smarts says getting straight A's and giving zero  you know who else gives zero right now this fricking guy because this Memorial Day weekend and there's a pool out there calling my name so let's make this quick hi pool testing testing testing testing yep we're good don't expect great editing here we're gonna be fast so guys this is my spoiler free review on a movie book-smart and it's about two straight-a students that have been like perfect students throughout all a high school they wanted to do everything perfectly right because they wanted to get into the good schools last day of school they realized that all the kids that were having fun they're going to the same freakin schools and they're like what the hell so when they decide in one night they're gonna have like the greatest frickin night in the world party their asses off and make up for lost time by trying to find this one party of the real popular kids now the story and this is really cool it's got kind of a John Hughes 1980s kind of feel but the difference is it's not like this jocks versus nerds thing you always see in every freakin movie no there's everything in between in this and the characters feel a lot more real except for the two gay guys that do theater they're a little bit over the top but everybody else here is very grounded which means anyone who watches this really can find one character they can kind of relate to when they were in high school and the students here they're just really trying to figure themselves out I think everybody is in in some way the two main girls Billy and Molly are great together in this the big girl I'm not saying that in a bad way I like big girls even though I wouldn't like a 20 year old big girl Tanika P beanie Feldstein my friend I'm missin Natasha told me she's in what we do in the shadows the TV show I love the movie they said the show's good too so I want to see that and I gotta tell you she's got a bright future ahead of her because she's freaking awesome in this I did a little research on her and it turns out she's Jonah Hill's little sister I had no freaking idea also Billie lourd Princess Leia's daughter Carrie Fisher's daughter she's in this too she has like this running gag frickin great man it doesn't get old she's fun and by the way Olivia Wilde she's who directed this this is her directorial debut this is her first time doing this dude there's some scenes here like I can't wait to see what her second film looks like there's a scene I won't get into where two characters start to argue and there's something in the background that happened and it just the whole scene is just kind of like a picture of society today and I don't know it was just a really beautifully shot scene that what I was just like wow dude and this movie is a coming-of-age story that really is more relatable than most of these type two movies man there's just something about it the humor is great in this and there's definitely some laugh-out-loud moments this frickin Panda I love a pant you'll see the panda bear it's a stuffed animals freaking awesome but I think what makes this movie a little bit different is that where other movies that are coming of age that can be a real raunchy and everything and then it'll stop and remind you there's heart this movie the heart of the movie never takes the backseat it's always front and center with the comedy which is really nice you know what I mean the movie does give you it's raunchy moments and it's great comedy but the heart is right along with it and that's what makes this will be kind of different dude to me I mean it was fun to see some magical so if you don't mind right now I have frickin a shot of tequila waiting for me and a corona yeah yeah subscribe hit the bell whatever like whatever the crap that stuff yeah and I'm gonna go do a shot having the Memorial Day and thanks for watching [Music]
