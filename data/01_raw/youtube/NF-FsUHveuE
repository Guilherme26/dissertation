is going to be spoilers just let you know and hear talk about Selma solve this few days ago and first first off I don't understand how David o yo did not receive a nomination for Best Actor I think that's extremely bizarre and I don't understand that decision so let's look at the cast in here casting why's this guy who tim wilkinson who played President Johnson I thought he was I thought he was pretty sharp I thought he I thought he did really really good also as good seeing Giovanni Ribisi however you say his name I really I really like this after a lot and I like a lot of his films he's just somehow been in a lot of movies I like a lot you know gone 60 seconds flat the Phoenix avatar really underrated actor I think I mean Tim Roth was really good in this film particularly with the accent I hated his character but he did a great job and of course the man of the hour David a yellow he was great he was great that I can't believe this is the same guy from interstellar yeah he I thought he was great I mean just trying to get Martin's you know powerful voice down and and then the district I thought he was so animated Darren's the speeches about David's is such a great job there and he was just even just just looks like Martin a little bit you know like he he really liked just became Martin Luther King like he just just blew my mind I was like who is this guy that was wonderful I mean really fantastic performance let me tell you I mean it really struck me when he was in the jail cell and his wife Coretta King seemed like that moment in the film I was like holy what they're doing a good job like I i am not seeing David I am just I'm seeing Martin Luther King and that's phenomenal and unfortunately outside of his performance the rest of the film is just me it's it's not a bad film by any means but there's just nothing else in this movie that is as engaging and as stimulating as David's performance as Martin Luther King I mean his wife didn't okay job the symbol talker fees is good it's good there are some some really good scenes this seam right here really was was really intense you know the death of the character Jimmy happening inside that store that was really moving and when David or when Martin Luther King goes to to Jimmy's got a grandfather you know at the corners he's trying to console his grandfather because of Jimmy's death that was really moving and the the main march of the film the first time it was initiated like that scene really was gripping and and just just [ __ ] up and really got to me you know there's definitely some powerful moments in this film but I can't help but think that I feel like this movie could have been better I feel like this movie could have been more mmm so for that I think I'm gonna have to get this film the seven out of ten the film is not as great as David a yellow lolz performance so I'm giving it a seven out of ten and why you know another thing that two things that took me out of the movie common and Oprah I'm sorry maybe it was just me but when I saw this film when every time comment or Oprah was on on the film it it just totally took me out of the film I was just like [ __ ] it was coming and Oprah doing here so give it a seven out of 10 what did you think of this film let me know down below you
