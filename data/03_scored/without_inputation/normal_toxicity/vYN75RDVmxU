hey guys,0.05914233
so I went to watch Wonder Woman okay so we all know that the most anticipated movie of the summer was Wonder Woman now did it live up to a type,0.11966154
I personally like to think that yes Wonder Woman did live up to the height,0.24209878
if you see the final trailer for Wonder Woman that trailer does justice to the movie I mean just like every other action movie and stuff,0.10533512
it could really go bad,0.23980379
but in my opinion,0.06451758
I thought this movie was fantastic and my favorite part of movie was how they wrote these characters,0.109222874
how these characters were portrayed,0.065771975
so you have these characters Diana and Steve truck now the thing that I love most about them was the fact that yes Diana Wonder Woman she is powerful she's strong she's indestructible she's amazing she is Wonder Woman,0.12694064
and then you have Steve Trevor who's just a soldier he's just an average not average guy,0.15035976
but I really liked how they didn't make him weak to make her look strong,0.12375413
I feel like that is a huge problem with TV shows movies books that a lot of the times just to make a female character stronger,0.15218794
they usually write the male characters as weaker stupid and just overall horrible just to make the female characters look stronger,0.7444653
now for me that is a cheap way to write a story and characters you do not need to make one character weaker in order to make another character look stronger,0.12087728
that's just my personal opinion,0.067292966
sorry I had to get that out there anyway but here I love how this showed that she needed him and the rest of the guys and he needed her as well they really tag-teamed,0.08647424
and that's what I really love about this movie he was strong,0.13583127
and he was fierce and he had a good head on his shoulders but so was she and I think their partnership was fantastic,0.31089434
now the next thing that I really loved about this movie was Diana's morals,0.103551485
I love that even in the face of battle and everything she has a strong belief and your belief that keeps you going I mean for me,0.13465694
this movie is kind of like you mix,0.3024685
the story of Percy Jackson with Captain America and bam you get this woman movie because this movie shows a lot of Mythology but it also took place during World War Two and Diana really reminds me of Steve Rogers I know I don't know I'm probably the only one that thinks that they're just so innocent and pure they just wanted to send people even though they know that they're flawed and they could be horrible,0.25453362
but it's just their inner drive to help people no matter who they are,0.09487032
and that's what I absolutely love about Wonder Woman she's fierce she kicks butt she is just amazing,0.7764783
but at the same time she has a heart of gold,0.0580614
she really wants to help humanity so overall,0.2923375
