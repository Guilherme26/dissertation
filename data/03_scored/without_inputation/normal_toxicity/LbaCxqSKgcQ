thank you guys,0.045313165
so very much for tuning in today,0.060009617
we have a fun naturally charming film to talk about called eighth grade starring Elsie Fisher Josh Hamilton and Emily Robinson written and directed by Bo Burnham this story centers on a teenage girl named Kayla who lives with her father she's simply just trying to maneuver through the last week of the eighth grade while kind of dealing with the fears and the optimism of what high school is gonna deliver as well as the just other struggles of adolescence know every year we have that one film that just kind of comes out of nowhere and surprises us with how entertaining it was in 2016 for me it was sing Street last year was get out,0.06807736
and this year eighth grade is without question in the running for being that surprise hit of the year for me I'm a 40 year old guide,0.07765585
the story of the girl dealing with her last week of middle school isn't necessarily a plotline,0.10315009
that's gonna appeal to me unless I don't know the school is being taken over by rebel forces or they all turn to zombies,0.21981138
but the notion of me personally being able to connect with a teenage girl in a story like this is a long shot,0.21928053
I could still very easily enjoy the film I just think that relating to the emotional struggles of her character arc,0.0805537
I don't know could possibly miss the connection with me from my perspective but much to my surprise I did connect with the main character her internal anxieties genuinely resonated with me and I absolutely love,0.09379806
the journey,0.042334475
this story took me on I think this film thrived on three things the performances the progression of the storyline in the national tone of the dialogue,0.07965044
I had the pleasure of being able to moderate an in theater Q&A after the film with the lead actresses Elsie Fisher and Emily Robinson and they really did provide a ton of insight to the methodology behind the filmmaking process in this project,0.021785246
this is the first full feature film for writer director Bo Burnham,0.06668699
and I asked them about the dialogue and Burnham's improvised approach,0.05724447
and they've really cemented that notion they talked about Burnham's mentality of warning the kids to be kids and wanting them to be the ones who told the story from their perspective,0.15076876
Burnham didn't always want the dialogue to come through him from his perspective,0.070991874
they eluded to certain scenes where he would just toss out a topic and let the performers converse naturally they also spoke much more in depth,0.11147282
he wanted to have the interactions between their two characters specifically to be much more improvised,0.15978995
and I thought it was great because it resulted in a lot of natural jitters and gestures that really did capture the genuine awkwardness between two kids of their age perfectly and the more they spoke on the process of shooting this film the more it solidified,0.15524453
why their characters were so easy to connect with because they weren't necessarily characters all the time and rarely did it feel like they were delivering lines of dialogue,0.050536625
I think this focus on wanting the characters and the storyline to feel much more natural,0.068499334
are what made this that intimate film,0.16296604
that's gonna sweep you up into this story that it's telling you it doesn't amplify moments for the sake of cinematic storytelling,0.122058176
and it doesn't stray into melodramatics when it very easily could have it was comical at times,0.10668752
but it didn't force the laughs,0.074352145
and the script didn't try to land,0.049538255
jokes the humor was effectively delivered through just many organic situations,0.020338897
we have all experienced in one way or another which is why they're comical,0.10727079
there is no studio,0.0811595
vibe here the framing of the shots,0.2887296
and the lighting is all very simplistic,0.11991392
and I think it complements the storyline perfectly to make you as the viewer feel like you're kind of peeking in on someone's life and watching it evolve much more than it feels like you're watching performers filling out characters,0.14673819
I thought all the various relationship dynamics were grounded they were sincere,0.038258728
and the result is subtle but very heartfelt and emotionally engaging,0.0983203
the main character is simple,0.06641638
she's normal,0.19013576
most of us had shades of Kahless personality,0.18561614
when we were her age and that's what makes watching her path through this film so enjoyable so overall I'm gonna give eighth grade 90% on the entertainment meter it was extremely well done it utilizes a vibrant musical score to add another element to the storytelling,0.07228423
and I think my only minor nitpick about this film was that I wanted some more,0.10216263
I wanted a little bit more between the characters of Kayla and Olivia and possibly a little bit more backdrop to Kayla's family life,0.17752485
but otherwise it was a well-crafted film with charming performances,0.12352712
and it is definitely worth the watch,0.060472906
