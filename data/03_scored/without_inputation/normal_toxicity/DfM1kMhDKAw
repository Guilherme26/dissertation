better late than never right,0.16779839
I have finally got a Dunkirk review for you,0.07906685
so I was really really looking forward to seeing this one but I haven't been able to catch it because of some travel assignments,0.055432614
so as you might expect I've been hearing a lot about Dunkirk around the office,0.09466684
and most of my colleagues keep focusing on the structure of the story the limited dialogue and the large ensemble of characters,0.065366775
so normally I do like to walk into a movie with a completely open mind or at least as open as humanly possible,0.11023451
but in this case one of the big questions I wanted to answer for myself at least was is this,0.05304259
the best way to tell this story,0.051540975
now I think I'm leaning towards a no on that right now but that doesn't mean I didn't like it,0.04995777
in fact I really do admire Christopher Nolan's approach,0.06324969
and I think it served the movie well in some respects,0.082312696
but before I get too deep into my review a very brief synopsis for you the movie is based on the real Dunkirk evacuation during world war ii and it's divided into three parts,0.15217403
so the mole is about a young soldier trying to get off the beach,0.15495676
the sea follows a civilian boat going to rescue stranded soldiers and then third one is the air which features,0.027819438
tom hardy as a fighter pilot first off the obvious here on the technical front Dunkirk is fantastic,0.104867436
the visuals are stunning what it took to block all those extras is truly mind-blowing the sound design is incredible,0.16064188
and the way Hans Zimmer score is woven in is also something else,0.07295934
there are moments when it pairs perfectly with the gunfire or jet engines,0.0862564
and then all of a sudden it'll be in stark contrast to all that,0.07637828
and there are a number of moments,0.06533984
when both approaches drastically enhanced certain beats of the story performances are also spot-on throughout you believe every single person every single second beyond Whitehead does a lot with very little dialogue as the main soldier featured in that first part the mole and Harry Styles proves he's actually a totally capable actually a really talented actor in that portion too Hardy is excellent in the air,0.083377816
and so is Jack Loudoun who plays another pilot in that part and then with a seat three leaves really bring a lot to their characters you've,0.058186397
got Mark Rylance our strong sense of common determination to him berry Kyojin is George a really young kid just trying to lend a hand,0.064026274
and then tonglen Carney as Rylands his son who fits in right in the middle of the two of them and he really brings the group together especially when they start to navigate the situation with Killian burpies character really breaking it all down,0.2811382
now maybe I should give the movie even more credit than I was planning to because every single segment is pretty moving and memorable and the ways they come together aren't really in a haha see what I did there kind of way,0.046634443
the fact that they all connect actually feels organic,0.05057924
and the way they come together also winds up enhancing the atmosphere,0.051421247
no one visuals very clearly show you how dangerous,0.2653732
the situation is then you got the score and sound design which make it even more intense,0.04687136
but that nonlinear narrative format actually further highlights the chaos Dunkirk is missing the emotional beat of a traditional war film but in exchange for overwhelming atmosphere,0.083583966
there's a real chaos to the movie that makes the evacuation truly truly frightening,0.111350395
this isn't a scenario where the hero can save the day,0.066691376
and then sail off into the sunset,0.16845071
someone's survival is just a total crapshoot,0.6364068
you could see it in one of the very first scenes when the beach is being bombed we're focused on one soldier on the ground and we see the bombs dropping all around him,0.11175133
so it's one two three,0.06816389
and then it stops right before he gets to him and it's so intense,0.13415603
I'm giving Dunkirk four out of five duties,0.10767414
on the Dewey Decimal scale you may not catch every single name or understand every single line of dialogue,0.116544314
but Dunkirk will make sure that you,0.06479994
remember how treacherous this incident was,0.24172941
while also highlighting,0.068002954
the difference just a little selflessness can make and that combination is pretty damn powerful,0.32121158
so that's what I saw,0.07865519
but I want to know what you thought did you see Dunkirk did you like it sound off in the comments section below and I'll see you real soon you,0.1602547
