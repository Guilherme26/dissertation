seeing as Star Wars is a huge franchise and has been since the late 70s,0.04874037
I decided this is not going to be a typical review and more of a,0.08192476
spoilery discussion I mean let's be honest it's Star Wars you already made up your,0.15099713
mind whether or not you're going to see this so yeah if you don't want,0.23717023
any spoilers I suggest you wait until after you watch the movie before you watch,0.18151878
this review if that doesn't bother you then let's jump right in you hey that,0.24172041
movie chick here and today I'm reviewing Star Wars Episode eight the last Jedi my,0.28362736
parents were fairly big fans of Star Wars so it was something I definitely was,0.0757283
exposed to heavily as a child my thoughts I only really rewatched him her Strikes,0.4146657
Back and the terrible Ewok spin-offs yeah I was that weird kid I don't think,0.35563996
I can ever fully explain how far back or how deep my love for bad,0.1808619
80s films goes I sure the sentiment was my mom of course is she's the,0.18159895
one who had the Ewok movies recorded on VHS there's nothing wrong with the new,0.16307251
Hofer even to a lesser extent returned the Jedi stars just wasn't something that shaped,0.24066836
my childhood the way it did for others so yeah fast forward to 10-year old,0.15099911
me when the first prequel the Phantom Menace premiered I hated it well most of,0.2422342
it I love the costumes duel the faith scene was pretty legit it introduced me,0.15049013
to you McGregor in Le Portman who I am big fans of even to this,0.10291831
day I ended up liking Attack of the Clones more only because the cringy love,0.30956146
scenes are marginally more tolerable to me than the boring politic scenes from Phantom Menace,0.41333088
I'll take a bad CW twin show over boring session of c-span any day also,0.24207194
you can't go wrong with you McGregor at a beard one of my first big,0.2960904
celebrity crushes in high school Revenge of the Sith was the best out of three,0.22558406
only because your expectations are lowered so much anything is better at this point honestly,0.31419954
the first act is fun the third act has an amazing fight sequence and some,0.10434571
great emotional punches mostly from you McGregor and Natalie Portman gets the best line in,0.19515975
the entire prequel trilogy [Applause] thunderous applause I just wish George Lucas would have relinquished,0.085795894
control just a bit and let someone more competent at least help write the dialogue,0.095386565
in the story with him and apparently my prayers were answered when he did just,0.027001008
that he signed over his cash cow to Disney and in 2015 we were given,0.07472076
the force awakens I thoroughly enjoyed it it had a great cast some badass scenes,0.33736628
jokes hit and I'll give it a pass for all the nostalgic callbacks and basic,0.1557485
copy and pasting from a new hope because I understand why JJ Abrams had to,0.05855834
prove to everyone that not only could he bring Star Wars back but engage both,0.05131404
new and old fans though I will admit I was initially happy to hear someone,0.08916566
else taking over for the next installment we need fresh ideas and for someone to,0.068869546
breathe life into this franchise JJ irbaz isn't a terrible director per se but South,0.18382953
Park wasn't really exaggerating when they say he only uses member berries the new Star,0.15091619
Wars was not as good as everyone thought it was it may seem fun to,0.09339623
go back and recycle the past we loved but we end up with no sustenance,0.11710869
I thought you're gonna explain why people want a guy like me to be President,0.16996989
well that's important too I guess but it's just a symptom of the same thing,0.06359008
he makes movies at a pier nostalgia and more often than not forgets to shake,0.13697684
things up and try something new so the last Jedi was handed over to Rian,0.054677676
Johnson director of brick a film I liked and looper a film were Joseph gordon-levitt's,0.057362128
prosthetics gave me nightmares so how does the last Jedi fair then the last Jedi,0.28789952
has a fun first act in a thrilling third act the fight scenes from the,0.1544402
last movie are amped up to 11 here there was an especially cool fight scene,0.13174577
between kylo Ren and Rey against the Praetorian Red Guards I felt he even rivaled,0.19502692
the badass Vader fight from rogue one yeah it was that kind of awesome there,0.35152882
are some really gorgeous shots in this film especially in the third act when they're,0.14775099
fighting on the salt planet I would say the mo just emotionally gripping scene for,0.1724719
me was all done by an on character I wasn't expecting it and then realizing,0.090030365
it was clearly a setup for the new character Rose but I'll take it kylo,0.078029394
Ren has only gotten even more engaging and cooler to me here I don't care,0.1738611
what anyone says he was one of the best parts and force awakens and that's,0.10198373
no different here in fact the better dramatic moments all belong to him in his,0.16100588
interactions with Rey Mark Hamill's return was much more improved than that of Harrison Ford,0.11967286
who walked around with the face of a man who was only there for a,0.1426101
paycheck he puts his all into his performance and doesn't hold back it felt like,0.058986787
he never left which gave me a fuzzy feeling the lovely Carrie Fisher is here,0.10230249
in her last film role and she couldn't have picked a better one to go,0.08360153
out on Oscar Isaac gets more to do and show off his talents as more,0.12817818
than just a simple charming ace pilot also bb-8 manages to remain just as adorable,0.11392243
and hilarious as he was in the first movie alright you ready because I need,0.14941923
to address what I didn't like about this movie there were so many cutesy creatures,0.23987281
in this film for anyone who complained about baby Groot or the Ewoks you will,0.24158773
die from the cuteness overload in this movie at first from the trailers I thought,0.3752211
I was just going to endure like maybe one or two scenes of those puffins,0.25343367
which basically looked like what happens when you squeeze your cat's face but they don't,0.19505215
leave they overtake many scenes with Ray and Luke on luck I'm sorry this island,0.08111037
clearly looks like they stopped filming the Highlander just so they could film a Star,0.1048353
Wars scene here and even when I thought I had escaped those little cat penguins,0.15424776
they just get replaced immediately with icicle foxes and yes while the icicle foxes did,0.310383
have more bearing to the plot was it really necessary to crowd every scene with,0.07867837
them Russell's a gross aliens wears the ugly-ass Tontons that sound like dying camels I'm,0.90924853
really not exaggerating here it gets to a point where the main story is hijacked,0.17024638
by a subplot including big fluffy creatures that are being mistreated which speaking of the,0.17011747
main plot as is was good enough and could fill a whole run time why,0.07986548
the need to bak it down you got lay on the rebels fighting to survive,0.4052297
and escape from the clutches from the first order while ray goes to seek help,0.05428046
from the last remaining Jedi Luke Skywalker thrilling stuff right but then late gets put,0.09499509
out of commission and one of the strangest scenes I've ever had to sit through,0.17236896
in a Star Wars movie and that's saying something so in comes Laura Dern with,0.052107934
very purple hair it felt less alien and more like watching a woman going through,0.30184442
a midlife crisis Paul and Finn decide they don't like Laura Dern are her plan,0.07291253
so then a new annoying character rose set off to find the codebreaker only to,0.19918293
get sidetracked when they stumble onto the movie set of okhta and tried to rescue,0.13180912
some animals instead like I get it movie I get that you wanted to show,0.30006173
both sides of the coin that there's good and evil on both sides except you,0.17007963
never go far enough with that concept more on that later so yeah then gets,0.11446633
fuck-all to do in this movie his characterization comes to a screeching halt and his,0.9494442
subplot goes nowhere and is ultimately pointless in the end this movie doesn't even allow,0.25718436
him to engage in his many fight scenes and comedy bits which is something he,0.23933926
excelled in the force awakens he is completely wasted here and his new sidekick slash,0.30089384
shoehorned in love interest Rose is just bland her said it was interesting and why,0.18566325
she decided to help the heroes made sense but she mostly speaks in made-up sci-fi,0.097209096
jargon about technology I don't know or care about so she's basically a Star Trek,0.11850605
character without the charm she's just very preaching and consistent meanwhile as all this is,0.083071336
happening raised bucking around on a planet switching between her back-and-forth with Luke or kylo,0.24354272
Ren it is nowhere near riveting as the training subplot and Empire but damn if,0.7093121
los daddy doesn't try its darndest she basically just trains herself and learns nothing new,0.5876557
on the island from Luke they basically have the same conversation over and over again,0.04059745
the second act is the worst section of this movie it drags its feet and,0.2872682
clunk Lee goes through every storyline without being able to balance any of it out,0.09485261
there is so much that could have been cut down I hadn't felt the length,0.09036427
of a Star Wars movie since Phantom Menace but you know who should have gotten,0.07026356
more screen time instead Wendelin Christie have you guys learned nothing from force awakens you,0.31089434
don't hire brand of ptarth and not user she's clearly here as a substitute for,0.09353035
Boba Fett and she could have been a great one if they actually put her,0.42632517
in the movie she has even less screen time than Fett how was it even,0.24047
possible she gets two scenes accompanied by a lazy Disney death she would have been,0.5154597
an appropriate subplot in catalyst for Finn as a means for him to overcome his,0.11790521
stormtrooper past and his insecurities about who he needs to become there was no need,0.077891916
to kill her off so soon what a waste of a great actress I don't,0.84789
know the scripts to blame or the new director both but yet the acting in,0.10764093
this is not very stellar here the actors were struggling the jokes they they just,0.11746294
went flying man apart from bb-8 little skits I found myself sighing or cringing away,0.24219987
from the screen there is a scene where Luke Skywalker drinks gross green alien milk,0.17595635
from a strange creatures utters it will never leave my brain and I'm pretty sure,0.25231135
it will haunt my dreams for the rest of my life though Mr Cable does,0.107754976
manage to breathe some life into these lines the director seems to be working against,0.15469782
him on it when you're first introduced to him rave returns his lightsaber just like,0.085082695
at the end of the force awakens and Mark Hamill with a straight face Chuck's,0.15526132
the laser sword off a cliff I actually started chuckle until I realized the music,0.45753697
and Daisy Ridley were playing this off so seriously it squashed the joke before could,0.17989089
ever actually take off and that's just the tip of the iceberg in this film,0.09851219
there is no balance or proper placing of the jokes in juxtaposition to the more,0.06045129
dramatic scenes of this film seems that should be tenser sad or interrupted by crappy,0.5398222
one-liners or lame gags being crammed in like after Poland the rebels barely survived an,0.22743024
attack from the first order then wakes up leaking this weird fluid everywhere from his,0.48846012
plastic bubble suit seriously movie you just made me watch all these casualties and you,0.27724177
stop it all for a lame sight gag I understand films need levity but not,0.31629384
to the point that it disrupts the pivotal moments I won't be putting the entire,0.10214811
blame on the last Jedi as it's a pattern of notice with many movies of,0.14468998
today I was quite fond of Daisy Ridley's performance in force awakens all the complaints,0.08015454
of her being a Mary Sue I thought were unfounded as she was no different,0.15498039
than that of Luke from a new hope she was a pretty good role model,0.034571853
for young girls and she was successful in both the light-hearted moments as well as,0.06487062
the more darker and emotional scenes I was definitely excited to see how they would,0.06030613
further her character development in the next installment and does she a short answer she,0.08372127
doesn't not really the long answer I had the same problem here that I did,0.050150987
with her performance in the Murder on the Orient Express Daisy Ridley is young and,0.3526241
is still paving her way in acting she has still yet to convince me of,0.16908514
really showcasing a darker side of herself I did not buy for one second that,0.08505504
she could be so easily swayed by evil she's to doe-eyed and her version of,0.48608363
anger is screaming like mice little sister when she was five years old it's not,0.39545345
always her fault she was jealous some really bad dialog like when she's first taught,0.31089434
to feel the force they use really heavy-handed metaphors like her dialogue is way too,0.13502486
on-the-nose she has to say things like I feel death in life and light and,0.55499136
dark the dark side is even symbolized by a literal dark giant hole in the,0.53490317
ground when I said I really enjoyed her scenes with kylo Ren it wasn't really,0.17785609
because of Daisy Ridley it was because of Adam driver he carries their scenes and,0.08508516
I'm sorry he just has the better more complex performance let me put it this,0.11342135
way Daisy really is not so much like Sarah Michelle Gellar's Buffy but more like,0.1437588
Kirstie Swanson's Buffy then we'll be completely cops out on giving her a more intriguing,0.17754878
and darker storyline the movie constantly hints and teases that she might turn to the,0.112294644
dark side in that they'll pull switcheroo and kylo Ren will turn to the light,0.07822321
however it's almost as if a Disney executive saw this and when wait we won't,0.061368085
be able to sell toys to young impressionable little girls of Rey turns evil cut,0.43912318
that out doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense as long as it's predictable that,0.082928866
killed the momentum of this character rape for me she truly transformed into a Mary,0.66554785
Sue here and it really made me sad to admit that I said I gave,0.08177277
force awakens a pass for all its nostalgic winks and nods but the last Jedi,0.06477748
is at its weakest when it's copying the other films most evidently and purr strikes,0.15104286
back it tries to recapture the battle scene on Hoth the training sequences from Endor,0.082024105
however they should have learned from JJ Abrams as past mistakes with Star Trek and,0.05786516
that you need to leave classics well enough alone there are a handful of pandering,0.3495471
scenes that actually do work here r2d2 is the one who convinces Luke to help,0.07253455
the rebels by showing him an old hologram of Princess Leia back from a new,0.18879887
hope and when Luke decides to destroy the old Jedi Temple on the not Highlander,0.14160384
island Yodas ghost shows up to give them some sagely advice and it actually works,0.041023318
however most of the time it just feels like they're copying pasting what worked from,0.06359294
impressed it's back and even force awakens and just writing off their coattails in the,0.09508416
end it came off more like a hot mess similar to return the Jedi than,0.19368672
anything else there are so many character arcs and storylines that are either dropped entirely,0.05996441
or rendered completely moot Benicio del Toro please the Code Breaker that Benin Rose had,0.123219065
to find not only does the storyline drag I mean it felt like an eternity,0.113025084
in that casino but when he actually gets her into helping them he immediately be,0.0938381
traced them in the next scene so yeah that plan meant nothing to really rub,0.10483086
it in your face Pope finds out Lauren actually had her a brilliant plan on,0.087257
how to save the rebels by using cloak transports to get to a salt planet,0.2496118
which of course ends up up because of their of having the codebreaker who led,0.2419708
to a betrayal of knowing where the transports were good job heroes roses Ark makes,0.078868225
no sense either her sister the non character with the cool motional scene she sacrifices,0.19445194
herself to save the rebels which in turn moves rose to become a better rebel,0.1519729
hero except in the end she stupidly stops Finn from sacrificing himself in order to,0.69542736
stop a first-order weapon from killing all the rebels because she loves him now I,0.8162367
guess and yeah they tried to shoehorn in that she learned some lesson that I've,0.093007214
learned not to kill what I hate but save what I love except you know,0.49183735
she's pretty much doomed to all the rebels if it wasn't for Luke luckily just,0.23996937
sauntering in disable other asses they would have all been dead she didn't know that,0.8355208
he was on his way there to help so she basically acted out of selfish,0.3771412
desire and did not really learn from her sister sacrifice ray on the not Highlander,0.31978014
planet learns nothing come look his lessons are basically just chastising her and telling her,0.12926918
about how the Jedi faith is good and dead he's a failure and she's too,0.60466677
easily seduced by the dark side up apparently they never shown me this but they,0.18737288
do like telling me a lot oh and that he doesn't believe in the force,0.13103467
anymore or something it brought me back to one favorite TV shows penny dreadful Marceau,0.27892575
- my favorite episode in season 2 Ava Graham portrays Vanessa a young woman with,0.061247893
mysterious powers who was constantly fighting being seduced by the literal devil because if she,0.5154597
does the world will end and humanity will be doomed desperate and afraid she seeks,0.4641827
the teachings of the cut wife Joan Clayton who was more than resistant to helping,0.09573889
her in fact she makes her stand outside in the cold rain for three days,0.08529672
before deeming her worthy it's a great episode with some brief moments of levity brilliant,0.30740756
gut punches of drama as we follow the Nessa being taught not only how to,0.1634618
utilize her powers but is heavily warned to never use her darkness or it will,0.13895395
swallow her up and you believe it too now I realize that this is an,0.46356767
r-rated TV show that has more time to develop its characters but it managed to,0.069308735
pull this off in one episode with this entire movie never could all these plot,0.18886162
lines go absolutely nowhere except for kylo ren's watching his descent into madness is not,0.19074212
only fascinating but it was at times heart-wrenching early on he gets a chance to,0.061478306
kill his own mother and he doesn't take it he hesitates and the wastes no,0.8606264
belittle him for having conflict in his heart and still carrying feelings for those from,0.15908688
his past till the point that kylo just straight up de sizeable I guess I,0.21416254
gotta cut everyone out of my life and by cut them out I mean literally,0.7075526
to ribbons and when you finally get his backstory with Luke you really feel the,0.097241275
emotion and less sorrow between those two I wish Mark Hamill and Adam driver had,0.07985897
more scenes together as they were both the sole saving graces of this movie Adam,0.089131355
trigger also had some pretty decent chemistry with Daisy Ridley and I wish they had,0.14380167
further developed that instead of just copping out and just placing the black hat on,0.025724297
him and the white hat on her it's truly heartbreaking that Carrie Fisher has left,0.16310263
us as a person she was someone to be admired someone who survived and never,0.15309443
allowed herself to become a victim and always stayed true to herself and said what,0.14960584
she thought and her arc in this movie they had more than enough chances to,0.058088697
end it on a high note instead they have this unintentionally uncomfortable scene where she,0.1548176
gets blown out into space and we see her floating around is what we assume,0.47430435
is her corpse and then out of nowhere she magically flies like Superman into a,0.36418292
surviving ship and has a short-term coma as a result they temporarily replace her with,0.13564648
laura dern who ultimately sacrifices herself and the most badass usage of CG in this,0.4711358
movie she uses Lightspeed to slice through the enemy fleet it was awesome it made,0.19354166
me think of only hindsight or in 2020 and instead of laura dern they used,0.09574765
carrie fisher for this ultimate sacrifice instead no instead the classic character they decide to,0.09269186
kill off this time is luke kind of reminded me of the Dark Knight and,0.5563829
they're on fortunate switcheroo so yeah Luke astral projects himself does some badass stuff then,0.2266381
acts out one of his popular early scenes from New Hope and vanishes into the,0.07426511
force the rebel base is saved by him and Rey everyone celebrates kylo Ren has,0.07533379
now taken over the first order and the movie just kind of ends on a,0.10419542
Rando kid we met briefly and to show that he has Jedi powers the end,0.1152243
the ending didn't quite have as much of a punch as Empire Strikes Back did,0.1547453
or even attack of the clones for that matter I don't have any pressing questions,0.16459484
the same way I did after the force awakens now that I've watched it go,0.04780871
a very predictable route they I mean they already gave up Rey's parents as scumbags,0.794439
who sold her off for drug money or something which would have been an interesting,0.22492005
thing to bring up in the movie that she has no place here but they,0.17074591
just kind of say it and move on so another wasted element in this movie,0.1392604
meanwhile kylo has really turned to the dark side Rey is pretty much taken Luke's,0.07648736
place and with that little kid at the end it's heavily imply that we're going,0.14942423
to see more people who are one with the force and that clearly the Jedi,0.051370233
are not indeed extinct there were no real loose ends here not any that I,0.0931605
actually cared about anyway all in all this film could have been a great one,0.08710295
it had so many good ideas and interesting themes with grey morality but the execution,0.24228063
is beyond amateurish the dialogue is too on-the-nose and void of real human quality no,0.23963413
balance between the humor and drama the whole movie was a jerky roller coaster ride,0.1340681
that didn't know how to properly build up two scenes or characters so do I,0.073865496
hate this movie no what I watch it again when it's available in streaming sites,0.22342609
I'll give it a go and just watch my favorite parts and that's the most,0.051984496
frustrating element about this movie when it's good it's amazing but when it's bad it's,0.15053381
god-awful and just cringe II this is a rentable movie for me at best I,0.31089434
really hope they get their together and end this new trilogy on a high note,0.12845741
