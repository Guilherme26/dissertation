sending it now that I will probably butcher all the Japanese pronunciations throughout this video,0.7280353
hey I'm Amy and welcome or welcome back and today I will be checking the,0.0758225
Seven Samurai awfully 1001 movie checklist if you do not know what the one tells,0.28200066
my movie checklist or 1001 movie challenge it it is basically a challenge I'd give,0.14503019
myself to watch every single movie from the UN types of movies you must see,0.11393149
before you die book so far I have chucked 161 movies off the list if,0.4398681
you win no more and you can check out a playlist with my intro video,0.38613516
up there I'm also an Amazon affiliate so if you'd like to start the challenge,0.10592542
for yourself watch the movie I talked about today or watch the movie for next,0.08603511
week you can check out the links in the description and if you purchase anything,0.05778431
from there I'll get a little bit of a kickback and I'll make this channel,0.24492685
so much better as always let's get started with a short summary a poor village,0.18804303
recruits seven unemployed samurai to protect and teach them how to defend themselves against oncoming,0.11562848
bandits everything culminates with a battle between the village the samurai and forty bandits this,0.38607264
has been a movie I have been waiting so long to watch I don't know,0.097608864
why I waited so long for it it has been probably six years since I,0.070672676
first heard about this movie I think it was six years it was around 2012-2013,0.0792113
when I first heard about this while taking a world history film class or a,0.059943
class on the history of film in different countries I don't remember the name of,0.059340872
the class but we started studying Japanese films and we watched movie getsu which I,0.075258344
absolutely loved and we talked a little bit about Seven Samurai and Akira Kurosawa but,0.049990755
not like super in-depth as I probably would have wanted to I really wish I,0.07595745
had been able to take a class just on the like an entire class just,0.07834193
on Japanese films just on Russian films just on Chinese and Hong Kong well maybe,0.023640042
have the Japanese Chinese Hong Kong all of the Asian films kind of combined into,0.11421845
one class I just really wish I had the chance to study these films a,0.09653629
lot more especially just not have a week or two on one film because even,0.065846
like languages are different in different countries filmmaking is a totally different language in different,0.039360035
countries it is pretty standard all across the board for most techniques but there are,0.055072036
some things that some countries do that are very different than things that we do,0.07159597
in our country especially in the beginning of cinema filmmaking now everyone does kind of,0.044182617
the same thing it's a little bit what I talked about in Tootsie last week,0.11677787
where that was a lot of the beginning of what we consider modern cinema where,0.04274265
it's very quick cuts just a bunch of different plot points in different narratives whereas,0.11483588
in like the early in the early years of cinema nah this isn't necessarily early,0.024146426
this is still early ish but cinemas only been around for maybe almost a hundred,0.060603946
and twenty-five years so it's kind of in the middle of it in the 1950s,0.04602473
it was still very very much in its infancy trying to figure out what techniques,0.115638174
you wanted to use and filmmaking was very different in all different parts of the,0.0662324
world so like in the very early 1900s where the Soviet montage began what we,0.11653073
now know as a general montage sequence it really became popularized during at the film,0.05345364
battleship potemkin it was one of the earliest known uses of the Soviet montage where,0.062190194
you cut Clips together to kind of form a sequence and different techniques from different,0.12238737
parts of the world combined together to form what we now know as cinema but,0.05675714
back then cinema was its own language in each country I feel like I kind,0.07244489
of went on a little bit of a tangent there to get to my point,0.09871258
but this movie is definitely it definitely has its own language especially because it is,0.0597476
from the 1950s so I want to talk a little bit about the V language,0.07329336
of Japanese film as portrayed through the Seven Samurai and Akira Kurosawa's works but the,0.0013775419
most notable way that there is a big difference between American cinema and Japanese cinema,0.052540865
is how this giant epic film has been cut together and filmed versus a giant,0.100859106
epic in America the best example I can think of in American cinema of an,0.07926594
epic that is on this similar scale is Ben Hur which was made in 1959,0.09182339
a couple years after the Seven Samurai which was made in 1954 the pacing and,0.03922243
the storytelling in Seven Samurai is vastly different than Ben Hur it does take a,0.029924393
little bit to get to the big epic part in Seven Samurai but the epic,0.09965627
lead-up in Seven Samurai is told through piece of the story that you need to,0.028609723
know to get to know the characters and to get to know why everyone feels,0.05185889
the way they do at the end of the film and the end of the,0.048363436
most epic climax of the movie whereas from what I remember I've been her it,0.08849601
is kind of slow going I don't think I've seen all up in her all,0.16174798
the way through I believe it is when I still need to check off the,0.051746428
list but from what I remember I've been her it's just it's kind of slow,0.15545186
it's a little bit and there's big epic moments spaced throughout the film there are,0.05494102
some epic moments in this but it's not to the great scale because with American,0.14885195
cinema everything is huge it's always been really big really extravagant and in Japanese culture,0.14227772
especially because this one is focusing on a very small village where they can't afford,0.054935765
much and it's not supposed to be some big budget movie it was I feel,0.058297392
like it from the way it was shot it feels very guerilla style filmmaking and,0.30749023
focusing a little bit more on the intimate details of getting to know all of,0.15067537
the southern Samurai all of the villagers and going along with their journey of learning,0.051773634
how to fight the bandits that are coming towards them their culture of the village,0.37828857
and what they are suffering through with very little food tending to their crops and,0.11585339
making sure that they have enough food to give this samurai have enough food for,0.054713544
themselves and can still protect themselves from the bandits that are coming and because this,0.28778827
is such an epic movie it is very long it is three and a half,0.11417528
hours long it is so long that ended up having to watch it in two,0.12209922
parts which was very strange for me I usually try to watch these on when,0.102414
sitting so I can keep my notes in a very orderly fashion but it was,0.09055727
just so long I ended up having to stop it which I think kind of,0.12887709
aided in me being a little bit confused and not really understanding some of this,0.114265606
it was very hard to follow the points but there was a quote from 1955,0.047127504
from The Sunday Times that I thought really kind of gave me a little bit,0.15266131
comfort in not being able to follow it that says Seven Samurai is long it,0.089067
is brutal it is not always easy to follow but it is magnificent which I,0.06796442
completely agree with in so many ways like I've said before it is a huge,0.081569426
epic story of just massive epic proportions but there are so many characters and when,0.03663787
I say it's not easy to follow that is the reason why there are so,0.06323568
many different characters and it's kind of hard to tell them all apart and even,0.08194318
though it is told in Japanese and everything the like spoken language is in Japanese,0.038178373
you get subtitles but I could still follow the story pretty much without the subtitles,0.09885571
it is that it is why I love the show don't tell reason is for,0.04932327
foreign films if I can understand what is going on without understanding the language and,0.12151645
without meeting subtitles I think that is a great film I wish I could watch,0.10272537
some of these American movies and be like do I understand what's going on are,0.0991564
they do I understand what's going on if I don't know the language can I,0.11386697
understand what's going on if I don't have subtitles and I don't know exactly what's,0.070762575
happening and half the time I don't understand what's happening unless I know the source,0.06426416
material like if it is a Harry Potter movie or if it's like something that,0.09851616
I have watched a million times and kind of know what's going on so there's,0.041994713
some movies I'm just like I don't know what's going on can you please stop,0.24156828
telling me what's going on and just show me and this movie does that so,0.0706474
well there are times when if I choose to I could have walked away and,0.05748742
come back a couple of seconds later and still understood what's going on just from,0.08939098
what is happening on screen I absolutely love that but I just so many characters,0.05081688
to keep track of that even a movie said I understand what's going on I,0.09323705
can still kind of get a little bit lost with all the characters that happens,0.14283746
with a movie that I absolutely love so much actually a series Lord of the,0.050289266
Rings I love that series and I know pretty much all of the three movies,0.12666507
by heart but I still get kind of lost with all the different characters especially,0.0742573
the ones that have very similar sounding names it's just that's just when my brain,0.15367138
works there's just too many characters but it's still Seven Samurai it is so amazing,0.034821857
and the last thing I wanted to talk about is the way Akira Kurosawa does,0.06967071
the cinematography I remember when we talked about Japanese filmmaking in my class we talked,0.070826724
a little bit about a director who didn't necessarily stick to the 180 degree rule,0.08002185
if you don't know what that is it is basically where you have a line,0.106494024
that goes on this axis the camera goes on this one axis and it can't,0.08213406
go beyond it it can go around it but it can't go beyond it otherwise,0.075472146
you lose your spatial recognition of what has happening in this scene you just you,0.2444497
kind of don't know where you are it little it sets your mind off edge,0.24007072
a little bit but it's not something everybody notices right off the bat it's it's,0.14468688
something that I still have to watch for if I really am watching for it,0.058814418
I'll notice it but sometimes all just notice it because there's something feels a little,0.05051025
bit off and I feel like we shouldn't be on this side we weren't here,0.1579922
before we go somewhere else it's a little bit weird but I don't think Akira,0.16330715
Kurosawa is exactly that director I don't remember exactly who that was but he does,0.061006267
play with the 180 degree rule in this and at least one scene this is,0.070848756
an example of that scene sis you're sorry all our clothes not dummy one of,0.4602423
cocoa to table okay doctor it's kinda much ducting II know Petra came to the,0.07742602
game today what's up with jelly nobody know and there's one scene in this film,0.11751131
I absolutely adore the way it was framed at the very end of it it,0.10267597
is when one of the villagers Monza finds his daughter she know he cut off,0.21547613
all her hair before the samurai came because he was afraid that she would be,0.16543996
raped or taken in by one of the samurai and a way that would dishonor,0.6666908
her but he finds her with you in two samurai the two of them walking,0.1503174
out of the hut together and he gets really upset with Shino he beats her,0.26348114
and he berate her calls her a nlgger says that she has disgraced herself and,0.53490317
kind of just dirtied herself for her future husband once the lead samurai who I,0.17957495
there's so many characters in this I can't even remember his name I couldn't pronounce,0.0817154
it either even if I tried he comes in and kind of mediates what it's,0.09606437
happening and Matos soon comes to realize that his daughter is actually in love with,0.12846889
this samurai apprentice and that they look on his face is so sad and then,0.3590359
this shot where you just you see she no crying in the background and the,0.32969505
look of just pure sadness and terror of on Manzo's face of what he realizes,0.42643994
he it's done it's just so heartbreaking and beautiful and the last two things I,0.092991054
want to talk about with cinematography do have to do a little bit more editing,0.15089828
but it also is kind of the way it was shot as well with the,0.15476231
first thing being the way Kurosawa plays with slow motion or regular motion or even,0.08504278
sped up a little bit he uses these different speeds of filming to emphasize important,0.15578735
parts of the film similarly to the way Scorsese later uses slow motion to emphasize,0.08229406
very important decisions or turning points within the main character's life I know there are,0.047914438
women like my best friends who would have gotten out of there the minute their,0.40775555
boyfriend gave them a gun to hide and finally the way Kurosawa builds tension is,0.16838847
amazing he builds attention using cuts and close-ups and holding on specific shots where you,0.25781056
see the main focus of that scene his reaction to what is happening that you,0.094214864
don't necessarily see until you finally see what is happening it kind of builds the,0.085496224
tension up a little bit more so you were anxious to see what the focus,0.18907775
of this shot is seeing the clip I twist for this and they were so,0.1788103
many amazing clips to choose from was one that I thought was such a great,0.059233744
character moment in like probably the best character moment in the entire film it is,0.03600426
a scene where in my opinion Cuchillo goes from pretending to be a samurai to,0.15165621
actually being one by standing up to his now peers [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] indefinitely have,0.06489551
for the Seven Samurai as always these are just my opinions I would love to,0.06038497
know yours any comments down below let me know your favorite samurai film or even,0.15388384
your favorite foreign language film if in always films I have checked off already or,0.07212837
just saw my progress along in general there's a link to a Google Doc in,0.052971937
the description down below that is a list of every single movie I have checked,0.09533186
off so far this has been a very sad year at times and I wanted,0.092418894
to kind of end it on a very happy note but AMC is having a,0.06914324
special free screening and the 25th anniversary of this movie is coming up so I,0.06196704
thought might as well close off the year with Schindler's List but that is all,0.079385884
I have thank you guys so so much for watching I really appreciate every single,0.05690748
