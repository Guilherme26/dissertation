hello everyone my name is ryan cam and welcome back to the afi project today myself and my allergies are going to be reviewing a night at the opera,0.11638676
this was directed by sam wood and it started the marx brothers and this was released in 1935. just getting out ahead of this,0.06791904
now if i sound different than i usually do it is because well around this time every year my allergies hit me like a freight train and it was no different basically my allergies look at me like braun strowman looks at ra at roman reigns i'm not finished with you i am however on the mend and hopefully my voice will be sounding a lot better in the next couple of days,0.20548406
however if there is one positive out of all of this i have a pretty decent kermit the frog impression hello kirbythefrog here,0.15154399
but enough about that let's get into the review,0.07419891
the story goes that the marx brothers groucho harpo chico and the rest are wrangled into a complicated love triangle in which one of the brothers becomes a manager to an up-and-coming opera singer named ricardo played by allen jones the brother teams up with otis,0.11435949
b driftwood played by groucho marx and the two form an alliance to try and get ricardo into the big time,0.22864462
while also the love that he pines for in this series i've already covered one marx brothers movie already duck soup,0.20499144
and i said in that review that what i love the most about this movie is that there's not really all that much of a plot and that there's just a series of setups for the marx brothers to just run roughshod over everything using just amazing comedic timing and that goes double for a night of the opera with a twist while in duck soup where the plot is pretty interchangeable in a night of the opera,0.12952222
there's actually a pretty meaty story going on throughout and i learned in my research that there was a certain section of marx brothers fans that weren't exactly hyped about the idea of it because the marx brothers up until that point had been known for just making fun of everybody with equal gusto but not only did this movie be successful,0.100422464
it was one of the highest grossing movies of 1935,0.11136332
and one of the highest grossing movies of all time for mgm,0.09557533
this was yet another first time watch for me,0.055026114
and i gotta say i really dug this,0.100463785
i i think i may like duck soup just a little bit more than this however the as far as i'm concerned these movies are 1a and 1b and that falls at the feet of the amazing timing and chemistry between all of the marx brothers they seem to have this like link going on between them where if one sets up a joke then the other just completes it,0.15459885
and you don't even know where it's coming from the one-liners come so fast,0.19313739
that at a certain point,0.05218262
you're just like stop stop,0.518493
i i gotta,0.06358141
i gotta i gotta laugh,0.15166932
at the right thing before i get to this other thing i think that i hate in comedies nowadays is that there's this awkward like pause where a joke happens and it just it just feels like that's the scriptwriter being like,0.25616807
okay,0.050967902
this is where the audience is going to laugh,0.0849057
once you notice it,0.06297708
you can't unnotice it however in a marx brothers movie those don't exist,0.24056026
these jokes come at a million miles an hour and you have to be paying attention to every frame in order to get them,0.10481338
but the story about the love triangle is actually pretty well done as well i'm not familiar with alan jones's other work but i but he was really good in this and i've never really heard of him doing anything else other than this movie so i'll have to do some research into if he did anything else other than this but at the end of the day i think your enjoyment of this movie if you're a marx brothers fan or not really comes down to whether you like comedies with more story to them,0.081653364
or just straight jokes for a million miles an hour,0.14672789
if you like more jokes then i suggest duck soup if you like more story then i suggest a night at the opera i like both and i quite enjoyed this movie however like i said i think duck soup is 1a and this movie is one beat,0.14145395
that is all for me guys,0.10986773
