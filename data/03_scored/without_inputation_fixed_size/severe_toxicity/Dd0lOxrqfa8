in its own way and the riding for this movie is spectacular the dialogue the,0.02069719
script it is so tight I never felt as if anything on the screen was,0.03909218
boring me because even though this is a slightly conventional concept like I said it,0.07840719

their graduation or pre graduation night so yes it's leaning on those tropes to get,0.049735118
the audience in but once you're in it does not lean on those tropes from,0.045926273
a narrative perspective it does things it subverts expectations to a degree that you're gonna,0.063558966
walk out having had a really great time but then you're gonna think about it,0.078405865
and think about how much you enjoy these characters together think about the chemistry think,0.032488234
about the relationships and think about how it makes you feel and how it throws,0.03781569

laughs in there and some people will see it as well those are just nonsensical,0.055005368
jokes directed towards teenagers and it's basically potty humor but I found the humor charming,0.063227035
and it felt like it fit none of it felt forced there were one or,0.03785427
two jokes that did not make me laugh and a few moments that fell flat,0.036167365
from a humorous standpoint but I was so locked into the characters I did not,0.041587282
care I was all in a majority of the jokes and these two friends their,0.027629733
chemistry just carries the entire movie I'm not gonna say on their shoulders because once,0.046970613
again the direction the writing every thing was really good but you're in it for,0.01957702
their relationship and you care when they have their quarrels and conversations and discussions and,0.046348665
thoughts on the meaning of life everything you're invested because they have built you up,0.02506678
to the point and delivered on every note so far and by the end of,0.024303814
the film like I said I walked out having had a great time but I,0.033044327
was thinking you know there were some moments where I wasn't laughing as much as,0.026457014
I should have been laughing but I just thought about the relationship between the characters,0.028800456
and how it felt so much like high school and it wasn't casting 27 and,0.044609874
28 year olds as high schoolers even though some of these guys were clearly a,0.04223517

super minor role and she's been on television shows but she is spontaneous and crazy,0.20024556
and this ongoing gag in this movie that is hilarious and that's the thing I'll,0.06228048
say about this film even if you're not having the best most incredible time in,0.052746404
the theater while you're watching it there are gags that start out at the beginning,0.043325406
of this movie and carry through do not get annoying and pay off at the,0.060763195
end I spotted three or four things in there that they set something up and,0.036026347
then they pay that off at the end of the film all of the character,0.039521888
arcs all the story lines they all come to fruition and they end off as,0.029941246
you expect a bit of a predictable nature but as you expect in the best,0.1321394
way and it encapsulates what it means to grow up it really is a great,0.04283317
coming-of-age story in that regard it reminded me of 8th grade last year with like,0.019529792
I said those super bad elements the over-the-top humor the zany characters the wacky things,0.09500486
that they get themselves into all of those things were awesome and yeah guys I,0.04757593

give this thing a score like I said it's not a perfect film I did,0.0716609
have a few nitpicks and issues here and there and maybe one or two things,0.047710296
felt shoehorned not the political nature of the movie that was one thing that I,0.04863756
was a bit afraid of going in like I don't want to be hit in,0.14004178
the face with certain elements and themes but now they didn't do that they were,0.041504133
just there to make you laugh and Olivia Wilde made sure of that by the,0.07030193
way her directing in this film cinematography everything to look the feel the relationships great,0.0491451
