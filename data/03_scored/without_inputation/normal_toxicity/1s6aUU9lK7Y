yep,0.05336829
it's a favorite,0.053347737
the favorite is the new film from Greek writer director jurgis lanthum us who just last year delivered the killing of a sacred deer which I totally adored this is his fifth film and it's the first that he actually hasn't written himself with those duties being handled by Deborah Davis and Toni McNamara in this movie we have the incredible pair of Rachel Weis and Emma Stone as cousins vying for the favoritism of the English Queen and some time during her rule in the early 18th century it's historically correct in terms of the framework like names and places,0.091318674
but if you are expecting one of those romantic prestige period pieces that are all about restraint and class then Wow have you come to the wrong place LAN themost does what he does best with this thing delivering a wickedly weird wacky and wild black comedy about a trio of women fighting with claw and tooth to gain maintain and then exercise power both political and personal the favorite is the type of manic ride where you'll just never get a secure footing because as soon as you think you've figured out the lay of the land and you know what's going on things will totally shape-shift and evolve and you'll have no idea where you are anymore,0.45229828
and that's totally thrilling that feeling comes from the delicious power plays from the central trio who are at career-best as far as I'm concerned Rachel Weis smashes through each line of dialogue with the force of a bulldozer using her words as blades as they jab and slice at anything in her way Emma Stone goes nastier than I've ever seen her before and it is a sight to behold but it is Olivia goddamn Coleman that delivers the most spectacular fireworks in a film full of them the balance of monstrous monarch and sympathetic sovereign that's defined by tragedy anxiety and a crippling need for validation and control is something of a searing spectacle that should not be missed these three women going this hard is worth the price of admission alone but you throw in that anthos edge and gang lookout because we are dealing with something deadly here the film is all isolating alienating wide angles blended with disgusting close-ups of people at their lowest but the sheer energy that those shots are imbued with mates,0.3589457
the ickiness of the vibe all the more exciting,0.105204485
it's stunning but it's also a grotesque and that lanthum us cinematographer Robbie Ryan duo continues to capture human beings at their most depraved and deplorable and it is totally amazing,0.5649105
the whole thing just feels off but not in the same way as the lobster or sacred deer where it was about depression and dread the favorites weirdness feels like a byproduct of the craziness of its characters and their capers within this story as always with lanthum us people are absurd and that absurdity is where we find who they really are because of this being a lanthum us film it becomes kind of hard to work out if anything in the movie doesn't actually work,0.24000974
because of how intentionally weird yet piercingly specific,0.14121331
all of it is so in the end it kind of comes down to how much you vibe with what you're witnessing and for me,0.15503557
I loved all of it the sets the costumes the lighting the music all that is outstanding,0.09100679
- but when you roll up to the favorite you're here for something that's uncompromising ly crazy and thanks to the three women at its center as well as Nicholas Hoult and Joe orwen who are fantastic you're gonna get that craziness in spades be aware however that the favorite has more on its mind than just,0.29618627
