really took everyone by surprise when john krasinski obviously you know from jim as jim,0.080145314
from jim in the office so he directed a horror movie starring him and his,0.0694791
wife uh where essentially there's these monsters who can't see but they can hear and,0.22756368
they have really good hearing so if you make a noise they're going to kill,0.4984827
you and so this movie's really about that and like the family's survival with that,0.043535605
concept but overall this movie is terrific this is my third time watching it and,0.024008473
honestly it gets better every single time john kozinski takes this kind of simple concept,0.12482304
of you know these monsters that can only hear you and they basically hunt with,0.28176543
what they hear um it's he takes that simple concept and really flushes it out,0.023405151
to perfection with really a really deep story that has a lot about like family,0.02218454
dynamics and really very a creative story with how he treats this concept of these,0.022398729
monsters but first this movie works so well as a horror film in the horror,0.12870905
genre first off it just feels very horror modern you know 2010's horror with how,0.072436504
it's shot it just it just feels that way but also it's pretty scary at,0.107635364
times it's not like super scary it's not like the scariest movie i've ever seen,0.09036121
but it is pretty scary at times but it's really more terrifying and suspenseful with,0.038563356
that's kind of the nature of the movie the concept of if you make a,0.01907015
sound you're gonna die that's real a really terrifying idea and the idea is really,0.24755467
done perfectly and really creatively like i mentioned like the stuff with the waterfall where,0.03596249
you can talk around the waterfall as long as it's louder that's really creative and,0.020784328
really all the like the cool stuff with like the lights and all these like,0.021810042
the fireworks and all this different stuff i have at the farm to kind of,0.027431509
combat this enemy i think it's it's really creative with what they do here and,0.13982625
that's definitely nod to the writers and the director as they just they do this,0.018337782
concept really well and that's one of the biggest strengths of this movie that made,0.0154382475
it so great is that it's just you take the simple concept and develop it,0.041258015
so much to you just make it perfect like i've always loved the opening scene,0.060970735
alone where you know the kid has like the rocket ship and he just like,0.041994374
turns it on and he just gets killed by the monster john krasinski's running towards,0.6384256
him it's a super like bold opening um for a movie and i um it's,0.08756345
really sad and it's really terrifying but i really love it it's such a good,0.058391817
opening to a horror film i think i really want the best in my opinion,0.13506687
when it comes to your crazy openings to really set the tone of the movie,0.089257
and it does that perfectly but overall this movie is just you know terrific with,0.021073017
the suspense and with just how scary the monster is but also this movie is,0.07742139
very dramatic with the concept obviously you know you have the daughter who's deaf and,0.11483331
you really have you know the family dynamic with that with john kasinski trying to,0.013159993
you know get make her a hearing aid and really um she ends up obviously,0.038045842
she's responsible for the kid dying in the beginning so then there's a dynamic with,0.13144362
that throughout the movie and then the wife is pregnant um and there's a dynamic,0.04029084
through that so there's a lot of like drama elements mixed in here that also,0.032539453
complement the story very well in my opinion and it really it gets pretty emotional,0.028855002
towards the end of the movie obviously with john krasinski you know getting killed and,0.42656827
sacrificing himself to save his kids in the movie and then when you see exactly,0.059843913
how much he was doing for his kids and for his deaf daughter obviously making,0.15950039
the hearing aids you know it gets pretty touching and heartwarming towards the end of,0.115491845
the movie with you just you see how much he was doing for them and,0.053784754
that definitely really helped the movie i think and it's just it's really nice how,0.034010176
they blended so much drama into you know a horror movie about a monster it's,0.23620531
pretty a nod once again to the director and the writers um with just how,0.017125152
well they did that and the family elements just work so well in this movie,0.01946527
and it definitely enhances the movie and takes it that next step in my opinion,0.04259437
the acting from pretty much all four or four leads i believe is really good,0.017022049
as well i mean you just get this really they all pull off this really,0.075950004
intense performance particularly emily blunt and john krasinski into two like adult lead roles this,0.10592185
they really convey the the the the tone of the movie just the suspense and,0.013126069
just how terrifying this world is um they really do a good job at conveying,0.049053967
that and that just once again it just helps the movie just be this you,0.05234995
know really almost a masterpiece of what they did here with this movie but the,0.020950625
acting in this movie is just terrific but possibly the best element you know obviously,0.028495137
the most no the kind of biggest takeaway from this movie was the sound and,0.05074287
the sound editing and the sound mixture and everything because obviously you have these those,0.022115361
dead quiet scenes where they're kind of they're being hunted and they just don't can't,0.15658955
make a sound um then you really mix that with you know these kind of,0.035858054
small noises that they're you know that they're allowed to make throughout the movie and,0.049068604
then you also mix that with like the score of the movie they mix that,0.022693405
in there as well um at different scenes throughout the movie but this the sound,0.02155062
editing is in sound mixing is incredible in this movie and it's just really like,0.052307382
next level type stuff and it's like unbelievable what they're able to pull off with,0.069190405
that and once again i'll go back to it a lot but it just it,0.05239585
helps convey the tone in the mat in the point of the movie with just,0.016106756
like these monsters hunting these people it really helps with that when you just you,0.28667805
have the sound which really is the most terrifying aspect of the movie but just,0.027011778
how well it's done and it really just makes you really terrified for these characters,0.019320259
as he really really pulls you in so overall this movie is just really an,0.09243525
amazing horror film in my opinion but my only negative with the movie and it's,0.07420323
kind of sort of a negative i think it could have used a little more,0.112885654
development the movie is only 90 minutes and about half of the movie is the,0.042652905
final act of the movie with emily blunt having the having the baby which is,0.10296311
really the main kind of arc in the movie um so that's really that that's,0.020384552
like half the movie i just wish there was a little more um obviously this,0.07353605
movie's really good so i do wish there was just more and more it was,0.020606725
longer in general because 90 minutes is pretty short especially for a movie like this,0.050945085
that move tends that does move really quickly um so i wish and i think,0.036946297
the emotion would have hit harder in this movie if there was just more a,0.04647106
little more character development it is pretty good everything is pretty good i just think,0.05250228
it could have been a little better in that regard not a huge issue for,0.016125383
this movie just something i can i kind of i wish there was a little,0.042781286
more development for pretty much everything in the movie but once again not a huge,0.034809723
deal with the nature of this movie and really like the sound stuff and you,0.048001647
know these monsters that can only hear those are going to be plot holes and,0.24160182
you know people are going to point those out but i'm not going to go,0.06090089
in depth with those you probably already know what they are um and i don't,0.038017906
really like i don't personally really care about them the movie is terrific in my,0.072427854
opinion i don't really feel a need to nitpick the plot holes they do hold,0.061138358
the back a little bit just because there is some like the pregnancy during this,0.088388935
whole situation it's kind of a little kind of frustrating um but it's like that,0.038170896
that definitely adds to the movie the pregnancy that's the the concept that make one,0.020621357
of the most intense concepts of the movie so i'm completely fine with it i,0.041450255
get it um i don't want to pick the the plot holes in the movie,0.05164153
but it's they're definitely present and there might bug people more than they bug me,0.05950334
personally i'm pretty fine with it but anyways like i've kind of alluded to this,0.05357522
whole video on this movie is just really good as a horror movie but also,0.1454597
as a suspense kind of thriller kind of movie and as really like as a,0.08048589
drama the drama elements also really work here it's just terrific from the acting to,0.036115482
just how they treat the concept to the sound editing and obviously that great sound,0.021183439
editing how well that conveys the tone of the movie it's just everything in this,0.04652095
movie works and it's really it feels like a movie that shouldn't work but it,0.031175828
just works so well and it's really a nod to john kozinski here who does,0.09520441
a terrific job in directing the movie um and it's just this movie is just,0.0701496
an incredible experience it's really endlessly rewatchable i might have to watch it again before,0.022571677
a quiet place part 2 comes out because it's just it's so good and this,0.064499535
it's really short and that makes it really easy to watch um i know i,0.034109954
complain about it being underdeveloped but it being 90 minutes also makes it a really,0.049234234
quick watch like this movie flies by it feels like 30 minutes when you watch,0.048060182
it because it just there's it's so much happens in this 90 minute period so,0.022114696
anyways i think this movie is really really good so i'm going to give a,0.049232237
quiet place 90 and 4.5 out of 5 stars i think it's definitely deserving it,0.022210483
doesn't quite reach 5 stars for me maybe it will one day i hope it,0.0276896
does one day as it gets better with every watch but right now i'm just,0.03764607
gonna give it four and a half but like i said this movie is just,0.021884542
an incredible and unique experience and it's just you know it's one of the best,0.013475955
horror movies that we've gotten in recent years and i endlessly enjoy watching this movie,0.08128478
but anyways that's going to do it for my review of a quiet place i,0.041339166
