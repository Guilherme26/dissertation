hey everyone it's Mariana and I actually had a different video planned but apparently a,0.072036855
lot of you still haven't seen the farewell and it is easily one of the,0.05706369
best films of the year it really spoke to me personally and you just really,0.105929404
need to see it so I need to talk to you about the farewell the,0.07923013
film is written and directed by Lulu Wang and is heavily inspired by the events,0.0561891
of her own life the story revolves around a Chinese family who after learning the,0.09201126
grandmother has cancer and isn't expected to live much longer decide not to tell her,0.15545626
about this instead they're going to stage a wedding as an excuse for the family,0.09000462
to get together before she dies I think from that description alone you can probably,0.2849577
guess that this is a very emotional experience and if you've been around my channel,0.086659305
for even a little bit you know that that is something I look for in,0.10120049
a film I needed to make me care I need to make me feel things,0.15246615
and the farewell absolutely did it for me I laughed I cried I contemplated my,0.10099566
life choices and it also made me feel really hungry because oh my god all,0.061284065
of that food here's the thing though the premise sounds pretty depressing and the film,0.15339257
is not without its sad moments of course but I don't want you walking away,0.1353191
from this review thinking the movie is a huge bummer and that's all there is,0.27543005
to it it's also really funny and honest in a way that makes you empathize,0.06835592
with the characters even though you may not agree with everything they do you understand,0.075216606
where they're coming from and it exposes you to a different perspective on life on,0.08815252
family and priorities in a way it's one of those films where every single character,0.09612989
feels like a real person which I don't actually encounter that often in films and,0.13333435
this may have something to do with the fact that the farewell is based on,0.048735626
a true story or as the movie puts it on an actual lie but this,0.15309836
makes it a and a very personal experience I guarantee you're not going to come,0.09815234
out of this feeling neutral about it and for a lot of people it is,0.081017874
going to hit home aside from the main dilemma of whether or not to tell,0.15550566
a loved one that their days are numbered when there isn't anything that can be,0.0993651
done and the idea of taking on someone suffering as a family instead of letting,0.2421895
them deal with it on their own there is a secondary theme of belonging somewhere,0.0932988
and feeling a connection to what feels like home throughout the film we see the,0.019681796
main character Billy struggle with saying goodbye to her grandma not just because they're really,0.17291147
close which they are but also because she is her connection to her childhood having,0.24058372
moved to the US as a child with her parents Billy clearly feels uprooted and,0.15403923
alone and when she comes back to China for this visit nothing really feels the,0.15886885
same the places don't look the same some of the people are gone and now,0.10860575
her grandma is going to be gone too now on top of facing the death,0.43147576
of a loved one which is already hard enough obviously she also has to deal,0.10880735
with what that means as far as losing her connection to home when that home,0.15479334
is already not what she remembers it to be and speaking of Billy I have,0.17992963
to mention awkwafina's performance because she is so great in this role the whole cast,0.08943931
is great but she really blew me away here I've only seen her in crazy,0.44041067
rich Asians before and she is great in that too she's hilarious but the farewell,0.3830666
is an entirely different role which gave her a chance to show a whole different,0.040543474
side of her talent I kind of think that if I didn't know it was,0.15015653
her before watching the movie I may not have realized that this is the same,0.14291045
actress she is that good from the visual aspect I loved the way the farewell,0.08618655
was shot there are some smart and creative cinematography in there and you can get,0.106671385
a taste of it in the trailer the color palette is used really well and,0.061834093
by the music is used really well too the film is a complete package everything,0.06517493
just came together here in the best way possible I do have a couple of,0.059873514
things I couldn't it pic about but I really don't want to mainly because I,0.07078251
just really loved the film so much but also because I don't feel like they,0.06560268
make that big of a difference there was a scene which had to do with,0.059398536
food that had the most obvious in-your-face continuity errors that were really really distracting to,0.14951724
me and were distracting me from the conversation that was happening on screen and I'm,0.06916195
being super vague here on purpose half the movie has to do with food if,0.14951946
not more but I don't want you sitting there and waiting for this specific scene,0.2102699
so you can be just as distracted as I was on the off chance that,0.066919394
if you don't know what the scene is then maybe you won't notice and you,0.116811976
won't be distracted but yeah like I said minor nitpicks you really should see the,0.15408155
farewell it is wonderful and it is one of those rare films that I think,0.14590967
would work for pretty much anyone unless you're heartless then maybe not I'm giving the,0.31089434
farewell four and a half out of five stars it was really close to perfect,0.05401016
for me and I think it's going to do great on repeat viewings as well,0.080923945
and that's it for this quick review let me know what you guys thought of,0.06745536
the movie if you've seen it already and if you haven't seen it you just,0.07704323
have to go check it out as I've said multiple times already if it's not,0.07965125
