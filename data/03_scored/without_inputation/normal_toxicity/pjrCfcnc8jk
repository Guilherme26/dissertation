hey what's going on out there YouTube,0.13525426
this is SEL zero three two zero representing JVs unfortunately I will not be watching any of you guys,0.24481699
as livestream comments I'm just going to be getting straight to the point because I want to be able to articulate,0.10294722
what I really feel about Wonder Woman after reflecting on everything,0.16344023
I saw last night after the review after the discussions after it was all said and done you know from my critical side from my critic side,0.06005486
what did I truly think about you know one woman because I think that it's so easy to get lost in the sauce with you know being excited,0.24113613
having a decent movie to having something that actually works and then having your friends be there to really enjoy it with you it's hard to sit there and critique something in that nature,0.1616605
so this will be my finite number review as well as my ultimate perspective on Wonder Woman that I saw last night alright,0.14567041
so here,0.058199726
we go um looking at Wonder Woman in the way that I would dissect it,0.1749355
I think that it's a very well-done origin story for one woman based on her mythos based on her character development,0.15430507
and I think that even from a written standpoint I think it was written very well I think they took a lot of time engaging where they wanted to go with the character,0.04746991
and it wasn't like necessarily tied down to anything with the DCU in any regard of what they were able to do before it,0.076593034
I think that the other thing about this that I actually really appreciate it is how the fact that when they actually did commit to the somber moments or the sad moments that they were able to push through them,0.10111918
they not that they lingered on like you know this doom and gloom kind of situation,0.26586002
but when there was something serious that was actually happening they stuck to their guns and actually did it very,0.09510688
well,0.039254032
I think the other part of this is that um when I was looking at the film I think that man-ho you guys,0.105004884
you sorry I'm on my breakfast right,0.19126587
now,0.031218953
so for me I think they were able to commit to those somber moments very well like when there was moments of you know like man,0.19375417
that was a weighty scene they committed to it,0.11113278
and I think that the credit goes to for me is definitely in street Trevor character it was played by Chris Pine he committed to every single every single line every single moment like he was the character actually rally behind even just as much as I did for Diana Prince played by God to died,0.079870895
but when he had these moments of like this charismatic character this brave character he acted them very well towards the third eye I think that he had one of the strongest pushes to push her into who she need to be as Diana Prince as Wonder Woman and moving forward,0.09220689
and again this is going to be a non-spoiler review um I now going through a lot of the positives,0.1018316
I think that the score was very well done,0.0490368
they they did such a great job with the score that I was really surprised that I was like I really want to buy the score um,0.051370796
I think that the set pieces where they went from London to the muscaria that was I mean even if I compare it to you know Thor Thor the dark world like this this rivaled that in so many different ways,0.29170018
I think that they did a really great job committing to how they wanted to showcase you know the Amazonians and the scare I think that there there was some negative stand points,0.11110149
I think there were some moments where I wanted to go more in depth with the lore of the Amazonians,0.08438339
I think they could have went more in depth with it,0.051689852
but I think what they gave us was enough for be like alright,0.057275
I'm hooked in when you make another Wonder Woman - which I'm guarantee at this,0.098813504
point they're going to I know that I'm gonna see more I know I'm gonna see more history more richness of where things are going to go and at the same,0.05427984
time there's so much intriguing mystery that you don't know everything you know moving,0.13842535
forward and I think that that makes for a really good origin story as,0.062005352
well but at the same time I think that critically you know I could have been given a little bit more I could have been like okay was this character pivotal,0.084977
so I think even like you know Robin Wright's character is amazed easing as her character actually wasn't this,0.051852442
I didn't know much about her you know but from from a compass and I know you know I think that they did a really good job with her and with the mother but I think I would have benefited from seeing,0.08272894
so maybe some flashbacks I think that definitely would have worked a lot better in terms of the film um the third act,0.046645347
okay,0.050967902
so for me,0.070436254
I didn't have a real problem third that I actually appreciated the fights you know the weight of it in the way they ended I think it ended perfectly in a lot of different ways from a superhero standpoint but I think that there were some moments where I was like okay Wonder Woman you know what are you doing like you know like okay,0.097091876
this is I understand your perspective on it,0.11626772
but I don't know,0.08970421
and I think that that could be kind of a negative critique,0.18392769
but at the same time the way the gal gadot character portrayed one woman her you know her vigour her light everything about her represented this person that was new to the world that understood right from wrong,0.15337615
they had a lot of book knowledge but didn't have any life experience as much as you know she's been around or Amazonians,0.11140347
she has not known what it means to see somebody suffer,0.44276077
she's not known what it means to see you know somebody weaker than her but at the same as that time have as much life as her and I think that when you think of somebody has a lesser being and not necessarily,0.16515872
I'm not saying she did,0.116686456
but just when she was raised versus what she sees she used she was a lot of growth,0.073762305
there's a lot of character growth in this film for her that gal gadot displayed very well like when she starts actually utilizing her powers,0.076298706
I was like this is better than you know,0.19311059
when Henry Cavill was portraying you know in men still like the evolution of his powers,0.12453542
and he got it so quickly,0.07046537
but this one was way more believable in terms of her as an amazonian at the same time even more,0.06880845
so when she starts stepping into the fold as Wonder Woman,0.15019025
I think that they did a really good job taking the time with that,0.06665747
and I think it's going to pay off in the long term because a lot of people their critiques what man still was that this happens here this happens here this doesn't make no sense while he do this,0.12671329
I mean this is a person that you know within a day it became ed and super me and he had no experience like you know they hadn't had experience,0.1493696
she had fighting experience,0.12035433
she has wisdom taught to her in a different way strategically you know,0.11167956
but at the same is that time she's never gone through anything,0.15016487
and I think that they were able to unfold that in this film so eloquently well um but what else can i really say without spoiling anything,0.1525226
and I don't want to ask any questions I really want to just articulate my thoughts in a conducive way,0.10416277
as to not fanboy out because the geek in me I love the film I really enjoyed the film I gave the film initially a 9.5 rating I must say this okay,0.10573823
and I can't give this film anything less than a 9 out of 10,0.15004617
I'll say that from a record like this is uh this is all my my critical side,0.053147182
this is on me as a critic I can only drop one point off of a ten only because I don't know any more negatives to actually go off on this,0.20842223
I really legit don't um I did not watch it in IMAX 3d I did not watch it in 3d at all I just watched it as the film as is,0.06383565
and it was a really done well film,0.07640742
I think that from the way that they paced it from the way that they processed,0.08237937
it the progression of it,0.06585805
I think some people are gonna be like this drives on a little too long,0.21952437
but there was never a moment that I didn't enjoy it,0.06040979
what I mean by that is there's committed comedic relief,0.07962627
there is actual leaf,0.054690626
there somber relief there's moments of just the quiet moments,0.06450171
there's moment where you literally see her in the mascara just looking out into the distance and you're picturing your head like what's going on through your head,0.2913563
but it's way done so much better than you know some of the other superior feels like not even DC Universe like some other superior friends that I was kind of like go there for you know like,0.10555092
they went there with it with her and I think that they paid,0.15111096
so much on watch not just to a superhero character but from the first in my opinion best female superhero movie they've ever done,0.11619925
I mean when we gun compared to we got a super girl,0.3497188
we got Catwoman and got electric all of them,0.49009597
technically we had two heroes versus Supergirl,0.15646622
but this was one of the best superhero films that I had seen,0.06650108
I think I'd actually make comparison to this one to spider-man 1 and Batman Begins in terms of superhero origin lore but as far as it being a film critically actually assessed,0.08338004
this was a well-done film this distance period,0.10738088
it is is a really good job with it was fun,0.07602224
it was entertaining,0.09236831
I can take my mom to see it I could take my you know my wife to see it I could go take a little kid to go see it,0.29940805
and specifically you know females like this caters to the female demographic not just female empowerment,0.48504224
but at the same time the preservation of life in and of itself that was you know brought forth from women like they even addressed that in the very early parts of some flashbacks of what you know the Amazonians and women in general did for mankind,0.18902662
and I think that the way that they portrayed Steve Trevor in the way that he you know respects Diana as much as follows and rallies behind her,0.0625778
and when it's time for him to move,0.09392236
he moves,0.07672927
no matter,0.09967093
what he's brave he's endearing and he's respectful of her which I've not seen that honestly and certain characters um,0.1171431
and as I said like I don't have any real big negatives,0.10518365
I think that um the villains,0.30973232
I don't think I didn't talk about,0.06591236
I'm not gonna not gonna go,0.104878165
in there I think that there were some weak moments towards the middle um but they were self-sufficient,0.21355443
I don't think that they came off kind of not cartoonish in the very beginning stages,0.11100968
when I was kinda like huh you know,0.09364585
and that falls into that - one that I would say but towards the end it all it all ultimately paid,0.10931576
off and I actually really enjoyed what they did for Wonder Woman I recommend you definitely go and check it out for,0.15079688
yourself don't go into this with a lot of high expectations like as much as I you know nerd it out yesterday and enjoyed the film and I keep doubt I legitimately did geek out um I would say go into it with low expectations go into it trying to have a fun time take your,0.30486554
daughter take your mom go into it with,0.7093121
somebody that's a fan of the superhero Laura are not even just DC Lord just going there to see a good action pad fun superhero,0.10111434
film and I promise you you're gonna enjoy,0.10095714
yourself you might rate,0.1541862
it you know a seven out of,0.1064713
10,
you might ready to eight out of ten my rating a ten out of ten but I promise you one thing that you're going to actually appreciate and enjoy the way that they crafted this super your film and yes this was written and helped by Zack Snyder and Geoff Johns and patty Jenkins did direct the mess out of this film but as much as that they did a great job um Chris Pine gal gadot stole the show for me personally,0.24222825
and then there were some other notable people as far as even their team their team was really dope,0.31883064
I just really personally thought that they did a really good job as a film critic with this film and I give it a 9 out of 10 again if you didn't hear me before I can't get anything less than that I was thinking about maybe as much as I could bash it or you know go back and forth,0.16926083
but even when I was comparing it to like man still man still still is one of my favorite,0.15518484
you know DCU films period you know um but this either one equals and rivals it or is better,0.09668049
let's just just flat out,0.15114203
but anyway my breakfast time is over I sacrifice my breakfast time to be able to give you guys a critical retrospective on Wonder Woman and that's what I have to say about it,0.15276828
if you have anything more definitely go and see me ran and kick out about one a woman again,0.6047116
the soundtrack was amazing,0.058285546
the score was amazing,0.057494976
the acting was done well was it perfect,0.070117086
there are most definitely some cheesy moments there were some moments towards,0.07369334
the third act,0.057282437
I was kind of like this is unnecessary,0.11427509
this doesn't make sense,0.06786153
but at the same time sincerity of the character one woman and what they were to bring to light for the character it was represented very well and me basically knowing the Lord and being movie critic I really could appreciate and rally behind Wonder Woman and I definitely will be seeing it again if possible I'll try to see it on the 30th with that press screening if not either way I'm going to be I already have my tickets bought arm for June the 1st anyway keep it locked JVs we can stop and I saw what you says I mean man still has some epic best action this one definitely rivals that if not it's better as far as action,0.075840384
I'll say that off the off the gate,0.049953084
if not the action this maybe pacifically better all right,0.083512835
you guys hopefully y'all enjoy,0.15048762
my retrospective review keep a lot JVs,0.10522017
when you'll stop leave your comments in the comment section below if you enjoyed the film definitely let me know if you enjoyed it,0.098344736
if you have not seen the film definitely know it's going to be something that you're going to really enjoy,0.07638177
and if you don't enjoy either way definitely some of the stuff is really subjective but make sure you go into it with low expectations and just try to enjoy the film,0.056265295
please guys,0.078749426
