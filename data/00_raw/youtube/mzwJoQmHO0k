okay so Logan so Logan falls a story a former x-men member named Logan also known as Wolverine and after a great tragedy that rids all the meetings all around the world he and Professor Xavier are the only ones presumed left in a while Logan is taking care of Professor Xavier he comes across a mysterious mutant known as x-23 whom also has the same powers as Logan does causing them to get swept up in this huge government conspiracy and ultimately a manhunt for this little girl Logan being a hard head that he is he was just like all right I guess I'll hell and during the mutants run for the government Logan must also determine if this is the fight worth fighting for and this is could in fact be his true Redemption in life now Logan is the third and supposedly the final chapter of the standalone Wolverine films and i believe the tenth installment in the x-men franchise some kind of too lazy to look that up right now as far as standalone Wolverine films go in my personal perspective I don't think they have a great track record at all i think they're pretty bad first we have x-men origins wolverine probably one of the worst superhero movies ever made just an all-around terrible film and second we have the wolverine and it's probably okay at best I wouldn't call it great but now guys we have Logan the third and final chapter of The Wolverine standalone fields and everyone wants you Jackman to give one last great performance as this iconic hero now I saw this film it's good it's not amazing it's just good now this film gives an incredible and vibrant feel to the New Mexico location in which the whole film is set in based on its surroundings it plays off as if it's a modern Western but with the element of superheroes thrown in the mix the settings felt dirty and grimy when you're looking at certain characters appearances and their environments or even some of the actions they commit this is a straight-up superhero Western it's a feeling that the x-men franchise are never really tackle for and it really helps pull it off when they have a consistency of the tone throughout which is that dark and violent feel that x-men fans have always wanted in their films and now I absolutely mean when I say it this is the most violent x-men film that we have ever received unless you count Deadpool I'd rather type person I just want to see dudes get sliced up by Wolverine himself this is the movie you have been waiting for this Wolverine film earns that hard R rating which leads me to another praise I have for the film which is how well the action is directed james mangold returns to the director's chair to bring us smooth and well shot action sequences that easily out does some of the previous Wolverine films it's like he really knew how to cut at a certain angle to really intensify what was going on in the moment of the film you absolutely knew what was going on and it was beautiful and james mangold directs his cast equally as great because the performances in the film by far so the best you've ever seen in an x-men film first do you have Hugh Jackman as Logan this is the best performance he has given as Wolverine is he gives a certain death to the character that we have never seen before now we all know that this guy has a past and he deals with a lot of internal pains but not like where you see in this film it's to the point where you feel extremely bad for this guy and then you have Patrick Stewart reprising his role as Professor X and just like Hugh Jackman proves how great of an actor he really is once you see his condition in the film or how he's dealing with certain things it's almost as tragic as Logan himself I almost got to the point where I teared up for him just the dynamic between these two characters and where they're at and they're pouring their lives it's just all sorts of tragic it's just amazing acting bodies to and then we have boyd holbrook at the main villain and heels pretty cool yo serviceable as the main villain he has a couple scenes that proves he's an absolute dick head is this going to be the film that you're going to remember months down the line I ask you don't think so I mean he did what he could with what he had and then we have upcoming actress Daphne Kane as X 23 and she's easily one of the best parts of the film she kind of reminded me of a little female Wolverine what she was perform an action she was awesome and badass and when she was acting in particular scenes you can tell that she is going to have a bright future ahead of her you're going to see more of her pretty soon those aspects in the film absolutely astonishing to see in a Wolverine standalone now I get to some of the things that I didn't like about the film and that is a pretty sloppy plot now the premise is pretty interesting because the mutants are now gone Professor X and Wolverine they're the only ones left and they meet at 23 pretty cool right what it's all about the execution how they get to that point where they kind of just gloss over a lot of the backstory that gets them to this point it's kind of like oh the mutants are gone so there you go and I'm over here like well why and how because I want to know some of the backstory so I can get behind what on the main focus and the chance that they do explain itself a little bit further and they do it in the most bizarre and odd way because it gets to a scene where Wolverine washes a recorded video on a phone and it starts off with a woman saying walls paraphrasing right here it's like this is what you need to know about a to be and it shone like certain events that are happening while the woman is voicing over the entire thing and it just shows like many different clips just to throw exposition any of your like okay does this woman edit this thing on her computer kind of took me out of them a little bit it is kind of executed story arcs in a pretty sloppy way I didn't really appreciate it that much also we have a straight of characters in the film that if you were to take them out completely it wouldn't be any different because they're ultimately a distraction of what was going on in the main focus not much of a secret anymore that Caliban is in the film and this introduction and story arc was like oh I'm here to help people do things in you know take up space we didn't really get to know much of this character all we know is that he was there just to do things and I just repeated myself and there's another thing in the film that really infuriated me I mean I have to be as vague as possible because it goes along the lines of spoiler territory but there's something that's just thrown in there that Logan has to fight in the middle / end the film and it's like why did that have to be in there it was about as lame as him fighting that giant robot Samurai thing in the Wolverine it was forced and it didn't need to be in there the entire thing is dumb now if you're a fan of the x-men franchise or the Wolverine films this is going to be your absolute heaven right here but if you're someone who just wants to go in and enjoy a great film and you're just going to find it to be good because I say if you want to see Logan it's best to see it at the matinee price from a technical standpoint it was pretty good and also in the filmmaking department but as the story itself it wasn't really that good for me but anyway guys thank you so much for watching my review for Logan and I want to know what your guys are softer about the film and what is your favorite x-men / Wolverine film
