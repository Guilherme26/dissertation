my opinion Chris Pine also put on a great performance as Steve Trevor and the,0.010042943
romance between Trevor and Diana was satisfying me in vest and not sappy as the,0.052208934
main romance is one of the most common areas where superhero movies fault flat but,0.018722923
not when it comes to this film everyone else put on really good or great,0.11712421
performances with Lucy Davis particularly shining on the flipside of substance the visual / CGI,0.02406834
effects were top-notch although there were some parts that boasted uneven CGI specifically the fire,0.04716285
effects however one particular department I'm not single out is the stunt work the stunts,0.037774447

angles to mask the not so spectacular stunt not that that's a bad thing because,0.029657213

depression inducing shade of gray but the film's handling and representation of the iconic titular,0.010057577
