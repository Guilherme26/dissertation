down and watch this type of film there is nothing wrong for anyone who does,0.10698489

engaged with the story the characters and plot may be standard for films today but,0.038779363

the movie and each one gets their moment to shine within the film Kurosawa was,0.04781153
a masterful director and was able to give each character depth and purpose within the,0.034785233
movie I don't know what I expected the first time I watched Seven Samurai but,0.057811208
it wasn't the touching and reflective story I found within the film the film was,0.041272134
released nine years after the end of world war two and I would be surprised,0.20461932
if it didn't draw some influence from veterans from the war and what they struggled,0.06644689
with the characters in the film want to help the people but they feel separated,0.0686389

living the pacing of the film was something that I was also surprised by the,0.045172255
film doesn't seem like it's three hours long the only part of the film that,0.08662726
seemed to drag just a bit was at the start when the villagers are trying,0.07793245
to recruit the samurai this was still interesting and I enjoyed it but it did,0.05932812
take some patience since you have to read the subtitles after this the story is,0.04708109
a paste in weight that you're never bored while watching I was invested in each,0.1798208
character story and wanted to know what would eventually happen when the Raiders showed up,0.039202858
the action is of course dated for when the movie was made but I still,0.08482746
found myself on the edge of my seat when the action started to ramp up,0.072772
this is accomplished by how well the film builds toward the ending climax the samurai,0.0909682
carefully planned their defense and you are invested in seeing if their plan is going,0.057442434
to work out each samurai has their own specific skill set and it is put,0.06703163
to use during the final battle I also wasn't expecting the comedic moments found throughout,0.042938087
the film and I laughed quite a bit while watching Toshiro Mifune is arguably the,0.0980456
most iconic actor to come out of Seven Samurai and he has most of the,0.11157229
comedic moments found throughout the film and he plays them brilliantly he is also one,0.025875842
of the more tragic figures found within the film and he is able to play,0.049768608
both of these aspects really well Seven Samurai is simply an excellent movie I understand,0.07772308

you are all just a little bit curious about the movie give it a chance,0.25489774
if you allow yourself to become engaged with the story the subtitles will disappear and,0.16349693
the runtime will go by without notice it is that good of a movie and,0.06895032
is worth multiple viewings I admit I was initially hesitant to give the film a,0.030739795
try because of the runtime and the language but I'm glad I did and I,0.062907256
