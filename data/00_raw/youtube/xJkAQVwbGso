a star is born so a star is born stars Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's directed by Bradley Cooper Bradley Cooper plays a famous musician he meets Lady Gaga's character she writes music she has a great voice but she's kind of shy she's like I don't want to put myself out there so during one of his concerts he invites her on stage she crushes it so from there the things build their relationship builds her career starts building and we're there front row seat front and center to say it all the performances are great - Bradley Cooper crushes her it doesn't surprise me when he does anymore dude is just top-notch she's a great comedic actor he's a great dramatic actor and he's great in this movie also a great director came out the gate swinging on this one Lady gaga also great I love Lady Gaga's career I just do you know sometimes when the singer wants to be an actor and you're like alright stick to sing and not the case with Lady Gaga I'm glad she can give us good music and good performances she might get an Oscar nomination here I don't know cuz I'm not good at predicting Oscars also speaking of music the music an alright I guess I'm now going to jump on the hypothesising Academy stuff that the music in here is I really like the soundtrack if this movie gets any oscar recognition whatsoever music has to be part of that conversation write a music itself was just an array of emotions that I really done but even the supporting cast surprised me oh I see a few comics in here a few comedians you might or will recognize Dave Chappelle and Andrew Dice Clay are both in this movie I didn't recognize Andrew Dice Clay for the longest time so I was like usually when I see Andrew Dice Clay he looks like that he looks like the 80s just sneezes someone out in modern day it doesn't look like that in this movie looks like a normal dude plays Lady Gaga's father he's not in the movie much but I thought he was good for what he did same with Dave Chappelle he's in like a scene in the movie but for what he did I'm glad that they're flexing their dramatic muscles one of the other reasons I like this movies people glamorize the fantasy of dating a famous person yeah granted dating this famous person actually helps her out was professionally speaking but one she wasn't looking for that but also to just personally it's different this movie does show that generally artists they're damaged people it's not gonna be the joyride you might expect doesn't mean there's not love there doesn't mean there's not passion there means there's drama there and one of the great takeaways from this movie that I personally had is how it shows when you rise in Fame and there are more moving parts to that machine it's harder to maintain the integrity of your vision and voice I don't I just really like that point is this movie hits a very pleasing try Fecteau if you want to see a movie about a famous person who's a bit of a rack who's in the wake of their fame you haven't if you want to see movie about someone who's starting to rise in fame you have it if you want to see a movie about a relationship between these two people and all the drama that comes with it you have it and all the laughs Joey tears awkward moments oh really well executed in those movies movies heavy for sure it's just a heavy drama so depending on your phase in life and where you are you got to be in it for that if you're like I'm not in the mood for drama I want to see venom you should probably see venom but if you want to see a heavy messy yet beautiful love story about love and fame will you have a star is born this is one of my favorite movies of the year if not one of my favorite emotionally heavy movies of the year what does it hit me and I will say a star is born is awesome tacular alright so what star is born have you seen it what did you think about it what's your favorite drama about a relationship whatever it is whatever you think comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more [Music]
