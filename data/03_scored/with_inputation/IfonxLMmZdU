hello this is a Hitchcock review and heads-up there will be spoilers in the last,0.19153906
couple minutes of the video I will give you fair warning when I get to,0.19133723
that point today I am talking about Rebecca Alfred Hitchcock's 1940 adaptation of the 1938,0.08426674
novel by Daphne du Maurier running 130 minutes stirring Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier this,0.06833165
was Hitchcock's first american film and the only one of his films to win the,0.12022723
Academy Award for Best Picture it also won for best black-and-white cinematography Rebecca tells the,0.0048405253
story of a shy awkward English girl working as a paid companion who meets and,0.38719305
falls in love with mysterious Maxim de Winter a wealthy Englishman still recovering from the,0.13322568
death of his first wife a year ago after a whirlwind romance they marry and,0.5063776
he brings her home to Manderley Manderley sounds better when pronounced with an English accent,0.15112568
as Mandalay his sprawling country estate where she finds herself constantly reminded of the woman,0.28951615
she's replaced Rebecca whose memory lingers around every corner it's a spooky romance and an,0.33941248
excellently done film the acting and directing photography Franz Waxman score the dreamy atmosphere visually,0.05579188
it's a detailed movie the huge set design of Manderley is imposing and a little,0.09830645
fantastic when John Fontaine enters a room my attention is always drawn to the massive,0.11274655
size of the door because the handle is placed at such a height as to,0.055239458
make her look like a little girl lost in a giant's Palace like I mentioned,0.48879918
in my Jane Eyre review I'm extremely fond of Joan Fontaine in these kinds of,0.08679945
roles she was nominated for an Academy Award for Rebecca but did not win though,0.06662166
they let her have it the next year for her performance in her second Hitchcock,0.0896775
film of suspicion according to legend her co-star Laurence Olivier sword at his wife-to-be Vivien,0.15253839
Leigh didn't get the lead was brusque with Fontaine Hitchcock encouraged this behavior and was,0.06906711
rough with her himself to provoke an ideal performance this method is questionable but I,0.12270201
can't argue with the results because as the second mrs. Dewinter Fontaine is perfect I,0.07675485
sympathize with her awkwardness and insecurities oh so much and that makes it intensely satisfying,0.1691765
to watch her develop a backbone and find stand up for herself Laurence Olivier as,0.23645788
maximum de winter might be a little younger than the part calls for and the,0.0839227
silver they put in his hair isn't super convincing but it makes him look very,0.1329873
distinguished and he does a fine job I think I might have had a little,0.064786136
crush on him as maximum de Winter at some point when I was 14 maybe,0.40331772
I think this is probably my favorite of his performances although his Richard the third,0.07463519
is pretty great completely different from this though I can't help wondering of course what,0.054267164
it would have been like if Ronald Colman had gotten the part story goes the,0.03951929
Hitchcock wanted him for it and he was interested and even Olivier himself said Coleman,0.10623864
should be doing it but Coleman had a scheduling conflict and couldn't going through some,0.07661683
highlights of the all-around outstanding supporting cast there's Judith Anderson as mrs. Danvers the creepiest,0.16291851
housekeeper ever no one can touch her performance Menace just flows out of her she,0.36783862
is a creature of hatred and spite with something possibly a little off upstairs she,0.53490317
makes your skin crawl and her scenes with the second mrs. Dewinter in Rebecca's room,0.34978256
are move chilling written and choreographed and designed so well there's also George Sanders who,0.111895084
did two movies with Hitchcock in 1940 I prefer his more likable character in foreign,0.08608995
correspondent to Jack LaBelle but this is a classic example of him playing the unmitigated,0.15228067
CAD Gladys Cooper has a relatively small part but I was struck by how much,0.07274155
younger and breezier she seems here than in other things she and neither Bruce are,0.13319063
one of the film's brightest spots and I also mentioned Florence Bates as mrs. Van,0.054105233
hopper who's only in it for a short time but leaves her mark I like,0.24194027
the moment when Maxim tells her that he's marrying her companion I love reaction shots,0.37317362
and that's a fun one as far as faithfulness to the book goes I guess,0.06763368
it's faithful except for a few minor points and one enormous one which I'll get,0.085601114
to in a minute but I'm not really the best judge of faithfulness in this,0.0820962
case because I read the book years ago and I don't really remember much about,0.057288002
it I don't even remember if I liked it or not I know this story,0.068677
is often compared with Jane Eyre and I will acknowledge that there our similarities since,0.051752377
they're pretty obvious but to me Jane Eyre and Rebecca are different they have separate,0.09916114
settings and storylines and sets of characters similarities between the two of them are about,0.0598007
as common as I would expect to find between any two stories of the gothic,0.09189535
romance genre so I don't dwell on them too much I do have a couple,0.08452026
things I want to say that take us into spoiler territory so here's that fair,0.091803394
warning to stop watching now if you need to I don't want to have it,0.28267118
on my conscience that I kept someone from watching a good movie by ruining the,0.15045851
ending even if the movie is 76 years old so continue at your own peril,0.18036483
okay first here's the enormous change that I mentioned the matter of the crime they,0.1597538
change it from murder to accidental death I guess that's quite a bit different there's,0.2235285
still the issue of getting rid of the body and lying about causes of death,0.3723701
but that's so much tamer than actual hands-on murder I would think Hitchcock of all,0.31678742
people wouldn't have been bothered by the original circumstance so what happened was they're concerned,0.07735988
that audiences would be too horrified and reject Maxim is this a censorship thing second,0.111103356
I want to express my appreciation for a scene I consider pivotal to the movie,0.09189377
and its central relationship and that is the confession scene and it's follow-up Maxim de,0.044846773
Winter and his young bride don't have the best relationship to him she's a nice,0.13466443
little thing amusingly different from his old associations he does love her but in a,0.16297667
distant often corrective way and secretly he's too damaged to believe her when she says,0.2400228
that she loves him and she's too timid to try to draw him out they,0.15402637
both know something's wrong but they can't communicate well enough to fix it the confession,0.07831804
scene flips everything over she has to track him down to the boathouse where she,0.27689108
finds him sitting alone in quiet defeat as he finally tells the truth about the,0.11912414
past everything between them is stripped away all pretense and shyness and they see each,0.15292563
other with new clarity she's surprised by his vulnerable and he by her loyalty and,0.12450847
strength the next scene shows her descending the stairs more smartly dressed and confident than,0.06505219
ever before she joins him by the fire and after some more discussion they share,0.31089434
their first real kiss of the movie she has now assumed the role of most,0.109456584
intimate confidante trusted with his deepest secret and with the air clear they are free,0.21748854
to restart their marriage with a better promise of happiness I love that and I,0.14889003
love the way it's communicated so that's what I've got to say about Hitchcock's Rebecca,0.08092025
I thoroughly enjoy this movie and I know others do too so feel free to,0.096977346
contribute your thoughts on it because I would love to hear them thanks for watching,0.101442024
