the farewell was directed by Lulu Wang and stars aquafina as Billy a young woman,0.04685953
who learns that her grandmother has a very short time left to live much to,0.103133395
her surprise she discovers her entire family has decided not to tell her grandmother that,0.10537507
she's going to die instead they arrange a wedding ceremony as an excuse for everyone,0.50310355
to come to China to see her one last time before she passes and since,0.031485137
some of them are having a very hard time figuring out whether or not they,0.038166907
want to approach her about this illness or at least trying to hide it it,0.07454048
creates for an extremely entertaining movie and one that really touched me to be honest,0.05619072
and I don't experience that too much in the theaters nowadays movies have kind of,0.017623376
forgotten how to grab you by the heart there's only a few that come out,0.16947882
a year that really know how to do it without being too sappy or sentimental,0.061417073
to the point of unbelievab ility but this film is able to approach this subject,0.06748554
from a well of knowledge about this culture since this is a true story the,0.017024046
film opens with text that says based on an actual lie because the director of,0.05972418
this film went through this exact scenario and she's written about it and made a,0.02803882
beautiful movie and one that consistently kept my interest with complex characters that felt like,0.022669459
they were real people that didn't seem like movie characters the film was comfortable enough,0.027159449
to have long sequences with people just having conversations and some of these conversations are,0.01857725
really fascinating oftentimes one of the biggest notes that screenwriters get especially SPECT writers is,0.059174072
that all people are talking too much right now people are saying too much let's,0.050778124
get things moving let's have something happen this film is perfectly content to show an,0.031294893
entire sequence in which people just have an argument over dinner about whether or not,0.03500795
moving to America from China was really worth it is the American dream really everything,0.05298321
that is cooked up to be and it was one of the most fascinating scenes,0.0511932
in the entire film and this movie has a lot of sequences like that but,0.023145065
I don't want to make it seem like it's a total drag this movie is,0.050335113
actually really funny and similar to 5050 in tone specifically in that it's a film,0.03091973
that's also about a terrible illness and a very sad thing but it's able to,0.032725707
find the levity in these moments and able to find the entertainment value in the,0.11737032
moments both films were also written as a form of catharsis for the person who,0.018523369
went through the event but one of the reasons this movie stands out so much,0.031019509
is awkwafina and her honestly show-stopping performance I really did not expect this from someone,0.04932669
who in the past has mostly been a comedic supporting role someone who kind of,0.024168782
comes in gets some laughs and then disappears and then comes back get some laughs,0.07403627
and disappears and he or she is front and center for most of the movie,0.02642708
and she's marvelous such an incredible actress she has shown so much range in this,0.037495073
film and I can't wait to see what else she does as a writer and,0.05697697
a director she's very smart with her choices she sets up certain things early on,0.02524638
in the movie that at first get a laugh and they're very cute and it's,0.052835535
just a great scene but later on in the film you find there's a much,0.021389645
deeper meaning to some of these things that you learned earlier and thought we're just,0.017569495
there for a laugh sometimes that can be called hidden exposition the idea of showing,0.04087354
us a scene with something and then as an audience we think okay that has,0.024981637
now served its purpose in the story and then later you realized that was actually,0.016930254
just set up for something more important and something more impactful and without getting into,0.030549224
it I thought the ending in particular was really beautiful it made me think for,0.09183791
the entire drive home which was like 30 minutes so I had a lot of,0.030746784
time to toss it around in my head there are so many great themes woven,0.28525937
throughout this story that is somehow able to approach them with comedy and equal parts,0.037141193
drama and this doesn't happen often with movies but I learned something while watching this,0.019472586
movie I had no idea that this was a common practice in China the idea,0.04471032
of being uncomfortable with telling a loved one that they are going to pass soon,0.041286618
and I had no idea that that it was so widely accepted and so it's,0.028040817
interesting because you get to see awkwafina's character Billy she's struggling with that because she's,0.03058714
lived in America for a long time now and it's really hard for her to,0.0723161
accept this at first and it's something that she just has to this movie wasn't,0.037987974
mindless you know it felt like it had something to say it felt like it,0.18106233
meant something which is so rare anymore with films this movie came with weight it,0.06863432
had meaning very early on and it always felt relevant every single minute felt really,0.021484766
important to this filmmaker and I'm seeing movies where you can tell the story means,0.029815527
something to this director like they're telling this story because they have to get it,0.02546589
off their chests like it's important to them and I felt that there almost every,0.08319851
minute of the farewell if I were to get really nitpicky about the film there,0.019418705
are times where the pacing drags a little bit there are some sequences that feel,0.04442695
stretched on a little bit too long particularly a third act ceremony that kind of,0.13343585
goes and goes and goes there's a karaoke scene there's like a lot of speeches,0.0571273
and sometimes the speeches don't really feel like they add much to the story they,0.015196785
just kind of feel like well we have to have this bit where the character,0.039189294
says a speech because they're the lead character and they have to say a speech,0.026763665
but then the speech doesn't really say much and so it kind of feels like,0.013480612
wasted time there's just a few scenes like that where it feels as if maybe,0.056140836
a little bit could have been cut and that's about it honestly it's also kind,0.13548261
of remarkable this movie is rated PG like I can't even remember the last time,0.055567447
I saw a PG movie in the theaters that wasn't like a cartoon or like,0.02503086
a family animated film like it's it's very strange I'm not used to that but,0.0394567
it's welcome I'm gonna give the farewell and a - guys thank you so much,0.056465443
as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like,0.02991597
