that happened but it is what it is a bunch of other great actors and,0.031431925
actresses in this movie that I'm not even remembering at the moment I mean you,0.09803743

sucky-suck he's in this movie Ray Romano's in this movie ultimately what this movie is,0.79981774
is it is a mob story but that's not really the point the point of,0.0236679
this movie is a journey it's about one man's journey Robert De Niro's character Robert,0.017864171
De Niro plays a character named Frank and I guess he's the Irishman in the,0.02127989
title and this movie is all about his life's journey it's about taking him through,0.039354924
his upbringing through the mobs about these two key relationships that impact his life in,0.05863461
a very big way one is Joe Pesci's character who is kind of like the,0.02210871
boss of bosses within the mob the other one is Al Pacino's character who is,0.02555569
playing the infamous Jimmy Hoffa if you don't know who Jimmy Hoffa is look up,0.05449783
Teamsters look up his disappearance it's all out there on the Internet the point is,0.028213099
Jimmy Hoffa was a very big deal in the area that they're trying to depict,0.033321045
here it's a live story it's a life journey and it's about Robert De Niro,0.021089647
his character and you're following him through it all you guys you got smoked up,0.09849308
I was like cinema got some bad bars you got some tan tours you got,0.11123134
some Dumbo's you got some elephants in the room that I kind of want to,0.27073175
get out of the way before I get to the real meat and potatoes of,0.11504617
this review first one is Martin Scorsese's opinion about cinema and about Marvel movies guys,0.071367554
I don't care I don't really give a about Martin Scorsese in his opinion on,0.058596026
all that to one man he's entitled to his opinion you're entitled to disagree with,0.047267284
him I'm not gonna really be focusing on that drama in this review I don't,0.025934845
really see why that would have my approach with this lubing the other elephant in,0.041011896
the room let's call it the tantor of the situation is the run time this,0.023372557
is a very long movie like an exceedingly long movie this is a three and,0.04632206
a half hour movie and it definitely earns every single second of that run time,0.03464343
and my humble opinion if you don't like long movies if you don't like mob,0.05976808
movies if you don't like long movies that have a lot of scenes where characters,0.027553236
are just sitting and talking I feel like this is not going to be your,0.029547457
cup of tea you guys know me I don't really care about how long a,0.041898586
movie is I care about how long it feels it's all about the execution it's,0.16076624
all about the journey and like I'm going to be using the word journey a,0.0077700103
lot in this review the other elephant in the room is obviously the CGI d,0.05619937
aging because obviously you're depicting these actors in a certain era of their lives where,0.06287183
they have to be younger and obviously all of these actors are older now is,0.040995933
the CGI D aging noticeable yeah it's noticeable I mean you can't not notice it,0.029321294
I think our eyes are trained to notice these things we're all in general after,0.018045766
a few minutes I didn't even really care about it I was so engaged and,0.038186196
engrossed in what was going on with the story the characters the dialogue after a,0.012482171
while I didn't really think about it but it is one of those things that,0.015043793
is gonna be kind of glaring when you first start watching the movie I don't,0.033268496
think it's that big a deal on Schwartz AC is an absolute master of his,0.055407137
craft obviously I believe that because I called him one of the best filmmakers of,0.038549386
all time one of those movies where you can tell that there's a master behind,0.073740266
the camera that there's somebody who has decades worth of putting out great art that's,0.07609967
that's what this movie is this movie has great are in terms of the camerawork,0.02678096
there is not a single movement not a single angle not a single shot that,0.08750624
feels wasted there's not a single frame that feels out of place movie is eggs,0.090892024
on the 10th omelet cities whatever you want to call it it's a gorgeous beautiful,0.039901707
looking movie with great lights those movies where the camerawork has a bunch of different,0.047525376
shots that elevate scenes that you didn't think that it would elevate the same because,0.07437884
you didn't think that you would go for that type of shot a lot of,0.2096732
shots in this movie where Scorsese obviously wants the scene to breathe a little bit,0.25076005
and he wants things to marinate you wants things to wrap so it lingers and,0.053496063
there are a lot of really great lingering moments and lingering shots in this movie,0.064680465
in regards to the editing for this movie I mean good god it's just it's,0.08399939
it's it's amazing it's it's Oscar worthy just like everything else I don't even remember,0.042900354
who did the editing for this movie I can't remember their name I'm sorry that,0.013994133
I can't remember your name but I feel like I want to send you flowers,0.02823638
that's of course your adieu that would be weird but then again I guess I,0.050860606
could send you the flowers you could just give it to your wife or your,0.05586079
girlfriend or something all right well when the this movie is flawless it is seamless,0.060466524
the transitions are great the way that the scenes are cut together the way the,0.043127183
music flows even though the movie is definitely jumping around to different locations in different,0.020906722
eras never get lost in it and you never feel like you're out of a,0.08755879
scene you always know exactly where you're supposed to be every single actor in this,0.032699097
movie is at the top of their game they bring their a plus plus a,0.024683634
game Robert De Niro this is one of the best performances that you've seen from,0.031762518
him in a really long time his character is so restrained so held back he,0.03525141
has to do a lot of acting in this movie with his eyes with his,0.13737306
facial expressions a lot of unsaid morality and turmoil going on with his character like,0.039602373
every single scene Robert De Niro is killing it I think with Joe Pesci he,0.3263466
came out of retirement he is so cold he is so in control in this,0.050105624
role if you're gonna come out of retirement you better be like Michael Jordan drop,0.026691824
to 55 at the garden because that's what Pesci was in it's Louie hard to,0.06090222
say which actor stole the show but I guess for me maybe Al Pacino because,0.058684498
he's playing Jimmy Hoffa and he is the perfect type of over-the-top that Jimmy Hoffa's,0.022867018
character deserves and that's one of the best things about this movie is how well-written,0.029002672
it is how good the script is dialogue in this movie and the acting blends,0.048695434
so great together that you just watch scenes where characters are talking and I was,0.02010451
hanging on to almost every word you know it is a mob story I wouldn't,0.13501298
necessarily call it your standard-issue mob story this is a mob story that has a,0.026806235
lot more in its mind than just the high life and about money and women,0.1432932
crime and illegal stuff I mean yeah that stuff's in there but it's not the,0.050569255
point feels a lot more reflective a lot more meditative course--a she definitely wants you,0.04057221
to sit here with these characters he wants you to appreciate their thought process he,0.02545791
wants to have some thought-provoking conversations about mortality and about loneliness and about the impact,0.02338187
of a life's worth of decisions that maybe you didn't realize it at the time,0.03943874
how it would affect you at the end if other mob stories are about living,0.043723185
fast and dying young this movie definitely addresses the consequences of living Oh some of,0.115179874
the impact that this kind of life can have on somebody it's possible to just,0.026744373
give Oscars to everybody like just give Oscars to every single person involved with this,0.074842475
movie like just clean sweep it retire the king that shit's nothing else I could,0.4718451
say about it's just just give them the Oscar even though it is a long,0.028078731
movie definitely I feel like there was only one section of the movie that dragged,0.06108182
just a tiny bit one of the six thousand middles of this movie where they're,0.08880268
focusing more on Jimmy Hoffa's legal issues he dragged for just a second but it's,0.036730777
just it's just a second it's like an main issue I have in this movie,0.045360204
is that there is a relationship there's a conflict and attention of an emotional nature,0.027014438
between Robert De Niro's character and between one of his daughters older version of his,0.028297577
daughter is played by Anna Paquin and she's not really given that much to do,0.027283173
the way that they hinted and built this up I thought that would be more,0.02379229
of an emotional payoff but there really isn't don't have any more words I I,0.015457538
can't say enough about how amazing this movie is the Irishman is one of the,0.029651891
masterpieces of 2019 I absolutely loved it this one deserves the highest praise of Superman,0.057284284
