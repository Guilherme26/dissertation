hey guys we just got back from an early showing of spider-man into the spider,0.15958956
verse and I gotta say whoa it's really really good yes I thoroughly enjoyed it,0.1250409
was funny it was had a great story you guys must go out and watch,0.1351479
this film yeah it's great I really liked it I think it's one of the,0.09984563
best if not the best animated film of 2018 III was really uh you know,0.08118233
encouraged by the trailers and and mostly what's that one movie where the best part,0.045164246
of the movie was the this trailer break up that showed spider-man at the end,0.15125108
and early showing or something like that and boy I could tell you man I,0.10325456
am just blown away about how good this is this is pretty much as close,0.15144125
as you can get to simulating a comic book on screen yeah I really like,0.10087434
the animation uh I know you before you saw the trailer you like I don't,0.110554546
know about this whole kind of animation how did you feel about that one yeah,0.09086598
so that was something that I was knowing yeah I was really worried about it,0.03830026
I freaking hated and I said I hate it hate it hate it and no,0.5614101
matter what I'm gonna hate it but as I was watching it you kind of,0.44870877
get used to it now do I do I and so and overall it wasn't,0.10029546
an issue you get used to it and you're into it and things work out,0.11492032
and by the end you don't really notice it but would it have been better,0.10472553
if it was flowing animation maybe but it's just that that.oh sees you in my,0.10958892
brain from from computers and low frame rates and you just see the like the,0.15492915
big said somebody can fix this but i swear to god you get used to,0.13673256
it and you won't notice it anymore the story really engages you and it involves,0.080220744
you and honestly I'm not gonna say this lightly there are moments in this movie,0.132961
that are literally a work of art I mean this is a creatively driven movie,0.08259503
thing you know what I'm saying it's just comic-book movies have kind of started to,0.10395642
get a little say me I mean we've had 18 of them with Marvel films,0.15222947
and we've had bad ones with DC and some good ones and and they kind,0.24143659
of adhere to a formula this one kind of throws the formula out the door,0.09631858
I mean this one seems to be able to take risks and and they pay,0.08625372
off in my opinion what do you guys think about about that yeah I think,0.11181861
that well it's a different it's a different medium entirely right could they get to,0.04232138
do more things because it's animated so we had longer more drawn-out fights that just,0.11335515
would cost you know hundreds of millions of dollars if it was real with CGI,0.06379769
and so we get to see some really like really exciting scenes like action sequences,0.0830115
in this this film we wouldn't normally yeah and for me it's one of the,0.075483195
better spider-man films that I've seen I just have not seen homecoming so what do,0.117851764
you guys other spider-man's that have seen started falling this one it's bringing the Spider,0.14583567
Man bringing back to Spider Man yeah it's surprisingly deep complex even maybe overly complex,0.1475643
for children now we went to a screening and they brought in a lot of,0.066824555
kids as well this is it's like 9:00 in the morning right now I'm barely,0.1518546
away guys but but you know I luckily they were quiet you know but but,0.17062995
I thought it was surprisingly deep complexed and it had a sort of a you,0.2401621
know mature jokes from tongue I wouldn't say mature jokes but adult jokes it probably,0.09246395
would fly over the heads of kids here and there of course they've got the,0.10897241
funny stuff as always but I was really happy with how it's not you know,0.114111446
sort of dumbed down or appealing just to the stupidity or the dumb parts just,0.90239984
fart jokes fart yeah you know when you're watching a bad animated film it starts,0.56103426
to do that crap this does this tells yeah this tells a complex story an,0.76987433
interesting story and there are a lot of characters in here okay we're not gonna,0.052133366
spoil it for you we're gonna talk about it and in spoilers but you've seen,0.13739069
the characters in the trailer so we have you know we got Peter Parker we,0.023134548
got Gwen Stacy noir spider-man which is Nicolas Cage I was also to see you,0.19440624
have like an anime spider-man and then you have a porker Peter porker yeah I,0.44514963
don't know his name but so what did you guys think of this whole spider-man,0.15242723
team-up thing though there was a lot of spider-man like there were pretty much well,0.14922148
developed like they all had the little quick things but it was great that is,0.068271205
funny though my favorite turned out to be Peter porker after I got like for,0.1032837
it I was like this is too cartoony I did a vlog news oh yeah,0.12416371
so I felt he was kind of disappearing in there and I was like what,0.08683854
is the point of view to porker I was more into noir spider-man but I,0.14759326
know the moment you talk about where they make a fun of the fact that,0.05725863
he's a cartooning goes off so that that is a standout moment of the film,0.1898601
yeah they do have other cameos in fact well we'll talk about it in spoilers,0.07624931
but cameos that you might guess and cameos that you maybe may not guess and,0.10894078
little Easter eggs I should say for for that if you're a fan of the,0.2829506
game there are Easter eggs so yeah just overall really well done the writing in,0.16831465
particular I thought was very good when they made a joke I was laughing now,0.120301045
I say this film route starts real strong to me like you know it kind,0.07395005
of throws a lot at you but it's easy to understand you're involved you're engaged,0.17886072
I think towards the end of the second act and the third act they're still,0.081567444
throwing jokes in there but I'm not I didn't laugh I wasn't laughing at those,0.12220734
jokes but I was still fully entertained you know what I mean so I didn't,0.058779016
matter at all to me that you know everybody was hilariously laughing in the audience,0.09971889
and I was like oh really good because the action was so awesome I just,0.05469855
I liked how they can go exaggerated because there are exaggerated moments in the film,0.06900682
the the villains you have a nice new spin on Goblin on the villains in,0.15289469
the universe because this is an alternate dimension Miles Morales so what did you guys,0.077119015
think of the title character Miles Morales he's our first african-american slash Latino spider-man and,0.33996525
hero yes he's Puerto Rican I'm about to beat you up if you say that,0.51915175
but he's actually not the first Latino spider-man that somebody else and you probably don't,0.2627212
know but I do know what do you think about this one I liked it,0.06500473
I thought I was gonna be like kind of annoyed like little he's gonna be,0.26703677
like teenage drinks kind of thing but it was all great and he act like,0.07714531
an adult and took matters into his own hand when he needed to they I,0.22683525
was worried that they were going to because he's new right he's a newer like,0.12344951
as far as like his him having the powers he's a newer spider-man and I,0.31089434
was worried that they're gonna be like oh he can't do it and him you,0.104427725
know dwelling on the fact that he wants to prove himself over and over and,0.13126868
sometimes movies with with teenage main characters they really stress it to the point where,0.033901025
it's annoying I get it you want to prove yourself like get it you want,0.31512484
to prove yourself they didn't do that they had just the right amount of time,0.09595475
and they developed him as a character and they didn't fall into some of the,0.07357804
pitfalls that a lot of these teen led movies fall into yeah you really believe,0.24140634
that the his teenage lifestyle where his family loves him you can tell his father,0.088035785
loves him his mother loves him you could see that we get a little bit,0.2404646
of the the sort of Peter Parker school stuff we get a little bit of,0.09555403
that with Miles Morales just with a spin on it in school and worrying about,0.071140155
what people think of him and things like that of course you know it's miles,0.083930984
and so it's slightly different it's all it's all really really fun because you get,0.08475071
to see a spider-man origin story with a different take on it and and it's,0.123007186
it hits some familiar beats but yet it's all unique and we see that over,0.06515537
and over because when we see and and I don't say that as a negative,0.073298074
thing because you think you'd get sick of it because they say we got to,0.2632269
start at the beginning cuz every time somebody's introduced they're like we got to start,0.04543308
at the beginning and that's funny yeah yeah but it goes real quick and you're,0.061178867
interested in in their little backstories I'm gonna see where they come from and I,0.2764668
think the story from Miles Morales has done there are so many references to his,0.043761496
comics they do him justice this like I said not only visually is a great,0.12859212
adaption of a comic book style just flowing and it works perfectly there but also,0.08508071
some of the storylines and themes and and origin stories of Miles Morales so I,0.030865688
think they nailed they absolutely nailed it is great voice acting across the board what,0.18316957
was the day Joe you know this the guy from new girl the Peter Parker,0.09097292
Johnson Jack Johnson yeah yeah yeah but at first I didn't I was like that's,0.0555205
not Peter Parker but I got used to his voice oh don't like okay so,0.18799175
I I was skeptical about that but he convinced me later on he did his,0.13970637
job really well though I heard behind the scenes that they were going to have,0.050705265
Tobey Maguire at one point voice one of these spider-man and you'll see which one,0.2481523
and now I think they're kicking themselves like they got read in any of you,0.60450476
or like it probably could have probably worried yeah but I think it win the,0.05183091
discussion with movie theaters they thought that maybe it would be too confusing for audiences,0.06835917
because it's like what universe is this spider-man from but it's not confusing because if,0.15041178
you look at the start it's clearly telling you what universe is from it's showing,0.083414756
references and scenes from Tobey Maguire spider-man so what are you little jabs Tobey put,0.24220695
out a commentary track where you do this voice just for free do it and,0.09924344
then when I get my DVD cuz I'm gonna buy this DVD I'll put that,0.16228549
on there so that the so that we get a little bit of Tobey up,0.097159594
in the movie because this was great man I'm totally buying this as you can,0.09288877
see what about some of these subplots as you feel that anything was out of,0.18798004
place in the movie or did you feel that all the sub blocks sort of,0.10181382
strengthened it well I didn't so what what's great about the subplots in this film,0.15097769
is they didn't feel like subplots because they were all actually involved and they were,0.07647839
important they didn't feel like we were going off on little missions to go take,0.0706787
care of this for no reason or go do something over here to take care,0.12981181
of that they were all actually important to the development of all the different characters,0.090028584
so they didn't really feel like subplots so I think they did a really good,0.083034165
job yeah we get everything the purpose didn't bother me at all mhm we get,0.10365146
villains that we've seen in Miles Morales this universe and and I honestly I thought,0.10620528
that because maybe they were it was a kid's film or something that they were,0.119711995
gonna change some of the story beats of Miles Morales for example the fate of,0.09651439
spider-man in in Miles Morales is universe but they didn't pull any punches you know,0.16879886
and and that gave the move the film emotional impact were you guys emotionally did,0.15187757
you feel any emotion and did you did okay well that's mark of a good,0.18977802
film and it's not just that moment from from his sort of origin story there,0.061594095
are other moments that are earned by the film man this is good not only,0.08745109
is it in my opinion the best animated film if I'm correct of 2009 18,0.07616024
but it's it's one of the best films of 2018 in my opinion so if,0.05839092
you're a huge fan of spider-man you're really gonna do you you're gonna freak out,0.7330535
this is him shown in a completely different way it's it's so nice and refreshing,0.079196446
to see all these different spider characters I didn't realize I knew that there were,0.07450356
alternate universes and I knew they've been doing other stuff with like Wednesday there's Marge,0.053082004
oh yeah I know there's a future man there's there's other spider-man and you know,0.24113579
so I just think you know and this is a complete story - they don't,0.058476795
try to sequel bait and if they never make another one of these into the,0.09307321
spider-verse movies this thing stands alone because of how good this is only if they,0.08481329
get the same writers because that dialogue is so strong that the jokes are so,0.07191852
smart and the references are like the right references a sequel bit a little bit,0.24113698
I don't know the very like we won't get into spoilers but they definitely see,0.074899234
well that is not in the film that is an after credits no no there's,0.053615417
absolutely something in the film itself for their sequel baiting okay no it's no that's,0.12899813
not what a sequel bait is it's complete freaking story doesn't shove it in your,0.48821694
face at you like oh man and now I need to see the next one,0.2063085
actually get the real story it's nothing like that it's really really satisfying this one,0.09436747
just the animations great the voice acting is great the writings great the creative direction,0.064046815
is great what else do you need okay so let's go with final verdicts let's,0.10319817
start with Joe I really enjoyed this one the plot was great like you said,0.11227912
the animation I'd like to come work style I want to see more of these,0.1823503
I really hope this apart to 910 yeah I think this is this is it's,0.076375216
got a couple things that I wouldn't call like flaws in the film the things,0.083886616
I would like to see a little bit more of and because I didn't get,0.084351905
to see some of those things that are only I mean this is almost a,0.066117615
10 out of 10 film from this oh it's really really close yeah well yeah,0.08932128
I mean where did y'all where did you miss the points well without putting too,0.115211315
much into it there was they kind of resolved the main story kind of quickly,0.053690005
I mean things just kind of fell into place and I mean it's already two,0.10086776
hour long film I have wanted ten more minutes at that especially during the climax,0.08645144
of the film just to kind of feel like we resolved everything it just kind,0.06361876
of felt like we got to the we got to where we needed to get,0.058339674
to things kind of resolved and then I mean it took a little while with,0.059361435
it but it didn't feel like it had the big the big ending that I,0.0893373
really really wanted yeah so I think that's why I get set 9 but it's,0.072110206
really high 9 for me yeah yeah it starts so strong it's really tight and,0.14683382
focused on miles and then when other spider characters start to come in it gets,0.08239018
it gets busy and it's not a negative busy but you still have to mention,0.10418065
that it gets busy there and you're like well actually guys you did such a,0.112689644
good job on miles I kind of want to see more of miles build up,0.07281351
separately from the other characters and and that but they do integrate it so well,0.02629563
his origin story with the other characters that you can't really be mad at it,0.27778363
the the villains were good I think you know some of the you know you've,0.24218479
seen some of them in the trailer but maybe you could ramp that up just,0.05751548
a tiny bit but yeah they were villains though they were good they were relatable,0.24045026
they're not like evil for evils sake which I always have such a hard time,0.12671313
buying like they they were they were really good villains and that's something that's hard,0.1551304
to do and a lot of these comic book films don't do a very good,0.18043041
job with them animated film actually I'm keepin remind me of the guy from I,0.24225424
thought it was cool I was like this is a different looking kingpin and I,0.09664906
liked his design it's ridiculous but that man has some power and you know what,0.6364068
it was invoking a daredevil Netflix's daredevil and what kingpin cares about most in that,0.18590741
film is kind of here in this film and referencing this man that's in the,0.12509997
comics as well so just well-done across the board I am trying to find reasons,0.07239411
to to give it a 9 but honestly I'm trying to find reasons not to,0.066085465
give it a 10 you know what I mean and why should I be doing,0.09839176
that I think that it's a 9 out of 10 but what I'm actually gonna,0.11333916
do is I'm gonna go ten out of ten on I don't fault you for,0.2907722
it either and the reason why I'm going at ten out of ten is because,0.10300465
I think it is such a wild success for creative minds for different directions for,0.12378481
different animation styles for just style this film oozes style and honestly at first I,0.111050315
was not I was skeptical of it and I was like I don't want this,0.0662004
you got a bunch of rap music you got the shitty framerate animation I wanted,0.93992347
to come in like a crabby Joe but it convinced me and I like the,0.18383864
soundtrack there yeah I know I'm saying I like the dang soundtrack by the end,0.113411255
of the film and it gives this Spider Man his own unique feel to it,0.04366215
and man it's just a fantastic film and I'm so happy that you know a,0.077572666
character like Miles Morales who when he first released you have of course you had,0.093480304
bigots and idiots you know saying you know talking about how forever and always forever,0.93232936
and always but also you have weinerman Fez look I don't want to news I,0.3489055
don't want to spider-man and they kind of him because he's not spider-man he's not,0.20204468
the spider-man or whatever and over time the they embraced him because they would read,0.18065919
them in the stories are you really good no he's yes and so for them,0.06554563
to also get his movie correct I think is a great thing for all of,0.104576856
Spider fandom and for everybody out there that you know loves superhero movies and in,0.056333795
an inspirational story of trying to be the best that you can be so this,0.07825485
film has a good message and it's just great all around so I highly recommend,0.05674516
you go out and see this in theaters when it comes out what a what,0.10876862
a badass success from Sony you know I I just didn't expect that from them,0.2584028
you know they it's been a while yeah I mean after what they did with,0.081019655
with venom which venom is fun but it's not like my venom super face is,0.27298546
so super faithful to the venom character other than some of his wackiness and and,0.31089434
it's live action so they have that restriction this and I gotta say this okay,0.109615296
I always say this DC animation is number one it's superb they're always kicking ass,0.9102128
not ninja Bevan but here comes shut up with the ninja but here comes Marvel,0.39607033
with like our freaking bazooka and they just nailed this if Marvel's animation is now,0.6364068
gonna be at this level I know this is Sony when you know in collaboration,0.086945966
with Marvel but way more of these please way more cuz just great alright guys,0.12723027
so if you want to stick around for spoilers which I don't know why you,0.2399828
would want to do that because this reviews coming out early but if you want,0.07155662
to we'll talk about some of the plot points and you can end the video,0.10193901
now and then wait till this comes out and then come back to the video,0.1521544
and watch the spoilers that'd be cool too so thank you so much for watching,0.06829849
and we shall see you on the next angry Joe show yes hey guys welcome,0.14162906
to the spoiler section where we can talk about all the nitty gritty here so,0.055806722
jumpers jump right into this this equal bait that you think what are you talking,0.24697553
about because they will talk about the end credits scene that's after all the credits,0.054575186
but what do you mean so he lies down at the very not that in,0.11539116
the movie not before the credits so like before the credits start to roll he's,0.0868382
like lying down he puts a sticker on a big metal eagle yes and then,0.31892496
he lies down in bed and puts on his headphones and then she starts spider-gwen,0.5094539
starts talking to him no I I didn't what what does she say but hi,0.08744315
hi it's Gwen do you have a time like it was like two seconds long,0.15518674
did I miss now fully sign in my life might take it or something what,0.104829304
it's like okay well then that's not a sequel bait if it's literally 2 seconds,0.1337867
long it's like a they still communicate okay they don't misunderstand the definition of what,0.09458546
I see well what do you think it's equal bait is a sequel bait is,0.114350095
when it's like literally all you don't you don't get to fight the final villain,0.15387604
and he disappears and Hank you fight is Noah's lieutenant and then and then and,0.14999975
then at the end of the film he comes through the portal and it's lucky,0.05830412
now we're gonna fight but yes that's an over a huge sequel bait but they're,0.16078605
definitely baiting that there's gonna be more of these films coming I hope if they,0.14083068
can talk if they can talk transdimensional II then then I think that's I don't,0.19638291
think that that's weird because I don't think that matches up with the film and,0.07682989
if it does then that's a weird sequel bait because she doesn't have that technology,0.35489416
well yeah we source there was nothing Ben should not have that technology neither does,0.06483824
miles and the the only person smart enough capable of that is two people even,0.15267241
the anime spider-man which she goes back to her own universe so I unless you,0.19135354
built one for everybody and then threw them through the portals but though we got,0.13557976
to talk about the end credits scene which is quite possibly the funniest you have,0.063873515
so I don't know see it sucks because I don't know in the main review,0.7839758
did I mention there's an after credits you did here okay cool so now we're,0.09059609
gonna spoil it and basically it's what is memes yes it's spider-man 2099 Miguel is,0.0969184
you know he has the technology and apparently another no it's not a goober it's,0.15031236
a device it's a gizmo this time which is gonna allow him to travel between,0.098429136
the vs. safely or whatever and so he travels into the next he's like I'm,0.0695138
gonna go to the beginning and they go into the 1960s cartoon late sixties cartoon,0.080454685
and they do this meme that we've always seen on reddit in other places the,0.059330285
spider-man pointing it's like why are you born again and he's like come with me,0.3180745
III need your elvers like it made the whole theater erupted and laughter and I,0.2244289
do hope that we do get to see spider-man 2099 and she had even Spiderman,0.10067604
the 90s I wanted same animation that whenever he comes back yeah okay some of,0.10513415
the Easter eggs there the Sony ps4 spider-man suit is seen in the background in,0.06674108
one of the glass cases multiple ones well there are also comic book suits and,0.07559404
so there are in glass cases on to me in the in this particular universe,0.10206575
is revealed like she's almost like Alfred she's got this shed that turns into a,0.15448037
spider cave with all this advanced technology and she helps Miles Morales make his suit,0.14979382
or help him find his his suit and his skills so that was really cool,0.16775726
and but what we do want to talk about so the emotional impact we were,0.041237287
saying on what made you emotionally impacted their job he just had a motional connection,0.15948828
with his uncle like they don't you got along and his dad didn't get along,0.14740394
with his uncle right he was still it's like his uncle was going down the,0.21538892
wrong path maybe yeah they really explain it much but it's revealed that you know,0.077326395
his uncle is the Prowler house and that's it the way that it is in,0.10702252
the comics and the and the problem I thought that the honker knew who he,0.0813741
was cuz come on he's a Spider Man you can see in there but I,0.2824853
guess not he just thought if some punk kid he's gonna kill some kid and,0.8254794
then when it's revealed that it's his nephew he's like oh no you know not,0.1406542
only does he hesitates he makes a decision to not do it he gets shot,0.44329965
in the back and miles picks up his body and he and gets him out,0.17988183
of there because you know this is a big epic fight with scorpion doc ock,0.23521955
who's a female Liz or something live and and tombstone I think it is I'm,0.3250745
not sure I I'm not sure that that doubles go though yeah the the guile,0.08075319
clone looking guy yeah and and they have this big fight in all maze cuz,0.31678855
miles got a little sloppy and led them there but anyway so he manages to,0.24287552
get prowler you know separated from the main group and you know his father rolls,0.15111762
up on them as as his uncle dies and it's a touching scene and then,0.5876557
and then you have the whole thing with you know the the brother going up,0.086271994
to his brother and seeing his brother die and he saw that separation they did,0.5154597
he doesn't want the same to happen with Miles so he tries to go into,0.0781896
contact miles yeah and the other one that I was talking about is at the,0.039674543
beginning of the film towards the beginning of the film where miles is thrown right,0.059379753
into the middle of a battle he sees his versus universe's Peter Parker who's this,0.071308814
perfect Peter Parker he's like the best spider-man of all time and he loses to,0.24809007
you know not only this Collider technology but also the kingpin they they literally murder,0.5154597
his ass and and right and it's touching right before because he's all messed up,0.95399976
but he's like you think you can get out of it but he's like I,0.19952162
need you to promise me that you're gonna shut down this machine and you're like,0.28601474
me and and you take this device and and and then they kill him and,0.8606264
so that gets an emotional reaction because not only do you see it with his,0.10958378
own supporting characters but you see the whole city mourn spider-man's death and that's what,0.1513625
you don't flow handled and it was in the comics so I'm not mad you,0.35329464
know throwing out a spider-man death like I was mad about Superman's death if they,0.40332648
didn't earn it that's that's a part of Miles Morales growth that he owes it,0.044191517
to his Peter Parker to you know sort of continue this legacy so it's really,0.09400618
handled very very well um Doc Ock has revealed you knows you think it's just,0.102679946
as weird and happy maybe scientist lady or whatever he and then she turns into,0.45441127
Doc Ock and you're like oh kickin ass keepin kingpins story was handled really well,0.83772
that he's not doing anything evil he's actually just trying to pull his is why,0.18804826
his dead wife and son from an alternate dimension and just kind of steal them,0.7691878
so he can have them again because they died in this universe yeah so he's,0.2804618
not just trying to be a jerk or just trying to make money I mean,0.8017854
spider-man wants to stop him because he'd been a worm to open a black hole,0.6364068
and kill everybody but I think I think oh well to any even even the,0.8919867
fact that he is a jerk because like even his family notices you're beating the,0.8606264
out of spider-man and now you're beating out of this other spider-man we don't want,0.2929206
anything to do stop trying to pull us into this universe we get away from,0.117789954
us and it's it's that so he takes out his anger and aggression and emotions,0.28050846
out on our spider-man and you know they highlight Miles Morales his powers for those,0.24019486
of you don't know he's not just a standard spider-man he has unique spider-man powers,0.1746929
that no other spider-man has had he could turn invisible he also has a little,0.1437812
bit of telekinesis what's not call that it's something Kinesis type of powers that he,0.18245055
can use oh they called it a venom strike or something like that I don't,0.1261339
think it's called venom strike in the actual comics but now I'm not sure cuz,0.100365475
I don't read a lot of Miles Morales his stuff though I definitely want to,0.110063165
now he's black and red man now is the time like right now is the,0.29983956
time to start buying all of the original brown stuff because once everybody sees this,0.13734864
movie they're gonna buy all yeah it's really cool and I'm I'm happy and it's,0.05391416
sort of like we're you know Nightwing you know becomes his own character and everybody,0.08022102
likes him she's a badass but now we've got you know another spider-man that it's,0.6047526
fun to see him and he's been in a lot of recent media for spider-man,0.19443361
so it's cool to see him get his own movie like you know the spider-man,0.31089434
video game he's in that and I'm pretty sure he's going to be featured in,0.11968861
the next spider-man video game they teased a little bit of that I hope to,0.10372216
see venom in that one by the way so and I hope does he maybe,0.20577824
venom in the next into the spider-verse film - no not Tom Hardy's version though,0.121860854
they could if they wanted to because now they hit they could play with so,0.08324661
much the fact that they have all these different versions and now that this one,0.10834638
did so well maybe they could do some flashbacks and get Toby to voice the,0.06453694
original Peter Parker because that's who so actually the this Peter Parker is overweight he's,0.3148889
depressed he's into it we go from perfect to everything that could happen everything goes,0.20743208
wrong worst loss Mary Jane kind of yeah but that first perfect Peter Parker that,0.17223088
was who they were going to get but I think they just reused his voice,0.19007236
the other Peter B Parker but yeah so um what else what else for I,0.05680228
like the fact that is as father as a cop in this universe now you,0.09968536
have sort of like a Commissioner Gordon thing that they could be doing together I'm,0.08880478
looking forward to working with you I love you and he takes off and because,0.09094102
he doesn't know they thinks it's some other kid I don't think they did the,0.12855871
reveal a change though because I get first thing his dad hated spider-man yeah not,0.25876683
only did he hate spider-man for the vigilante thing because you're a cop and you,0.54999655
you little jealous of the fact it's spider-man is doing he's getting all the credit,0.4784183
but also because at one point he thinks the spider-man is the one that killed,0.44771785
his brother you know miles analysis uncle because he's lying over him as he's given,0.45068154
his dying words then takes off so yeah just well well done the the side,0.2125672
characters didn't really have like they try to really milk the fact that the robot,0.050770424
lady anime lady lost her robot and it didn't really go anywhere it was just,0.19285022
like this small little thing just to try to get more remote I was like,0.108365364
okay now you're being just now you're just being manipulated you know like the sad,0.34552184
puppies fans you don't need to go that far but no she was super sad,0.19549412
about that thing and then you know ten minutes later she was billeted buts her,0.42715335
if her father died and that was that was his robot no it's well that's,0.31089434
true and she does build a new robot but she's still got the spider with,0.0974097
her that she has a telepathic link to yeah that's the only spider that they,0.14657989
didn't kill us I wonder what she would think about about all the other Spider,0.24464917
Man this yeah they killed it miles is just like it and he has it,0.7689935
doesn't even hurt him you expect this like great reactions but it does power transfers,0.091597386
and stuff they never explain where that spider comes from because this is technically miles,0.09556649
Browns universe where there already was a beauty parlor who already got bit so how,0.1468694
the spider had the the name of the the lab then they break into it,0.087541535
has they printed the lab was pretty close by cuz he was funny Green Goblin,0.09953865
yeah correct but you know I think I thought in his story it was like,0.05995251
made by Norman Osborn Osborne's stuff that he made a bunch of those different spiders,0.15438148
and and they got loose but I could be wrong about that but yeah I'm,0.10605268
sure you'll hear about in the comments yeah but just fantastic you don't have to,0.084914476
know all the comic book lore to really enjoy this and you will come out,0.15121281
knowing a lot of the you know best and character beats from each one of,0.060938016
these spider-man from their universes what about your Nick pics though new pics well I,0.42482832
already kind of mentioned them in the review what about yours I I wanted more,0.09548639
out of like the final fight because the they kind of get to kind of,0.10015481
get there and then they just like plug the thing in and there's it takes,0.06521412
him a while to get there but punching and kicking between kingpin I thought it,0.7777266
was good because it's like they're always wanting to help him help him help him,0.08901592
help him and then at the end as I could take a leap of faith,0.15793768
in me that I can handle this on my own and he goes out there,0.09401214
any kicks is that yeah it just didn't feel like a big final fight it,0.16429155
felt like there's a lot of stuff happening because the the beams were going off,0.080082715
and there's like city's being melded together and things like that but it didn't feel,0.06594022
like the like an end boss it just it was just really a fistfight between,0.19158128
Miles Morales and kingpin at the very end that's what pin does and so I,0.10451412
was did you want the fist fight to be more an extended well they were,0.19548921
like scorpion was there doc Hocker was there they had they had all of these,0.3530673
bad guys there but they kind of resolve them and they just like they immediately,0.40033227
knockouts court like scorpion gets knocked out with a hammer right and then Doc Ock,0.50549215
I don't remember what they what happened that she's kind of you know what happened,0.13200034
to her no good and they just get brushed aside and they do a bunch,0.28166428
of stuff when a lot of things are happening but it's just like I wanna,0.06536523
seem like Doc Ock was gonna have a subplot like she was gonna maybe betray,0.2513582
kingpin yet again with her own mansion agents at Sur machine it's not just machine,0.075690195
and that she was gonna do something like that but no that never you know,0.20947385
never goes anywhere I really wish some of the second and third act jokes I,0.09060314
was laughing at as I was looking at everybody else they're all laughing and having,0.14081739
a good time it could have just been because it was like 9:00 in the,0.06772659
morning that I was on laughing at every single joke you know like the anvil,0.22591352
falling on the machine at the end people hahaha because this thing well the anvil,0.28805986
was something there of the anvil I laughed when the anvil hits what's-his-face scorpion yeah,0.24108216
cuz that's in a moment when you you got one over by Peter porker what,0.2641237
happened he's just fun again that's what he does shyamalan he's amazing what happened he,0.10876112
dropped an anvil basically just like a cartoon yeah so basically just Joe won't explain,0.17474326
it to you they're in a fight and and he's like who are you what,0.30396685
could you possibly do to me you're just a cartoon and cartoons are lame and,0.69542736
stuff and he's like me got a problem with cartoons cartoons like they were pretty,0.2009037
violent and Damned Kong who shed any dead amazing spider-man moves and then he busted,0.8606264
out the mallet hammer and from his pocket and he said later on he gives,0.23986961
it to miles he's like this will fit in your pocket and I believed him,0.3060715
and then he drops a big ambulance 4 p.m. scorpion actually took that anvil pretty,0.32719463
pretty well it was the hammer that knocked him out yeah so that was pretty,0.39787522
funny and yeah just the use of colour the use of comic book panels the,0.116398856
use of spray pain and creativity and artistry just I got to give it up,0.20102288
to the director the writers and the you know everybody involved in that movie alright,0.06176615
guys I think that's pretty much any other standing her haircut is because he got,0.16841488
his fingers stuck on her on her hair and he's trying to hit on her,0.49364161
and it didn't go so well the whole put your hand on the shoulder saying,0.12399588
