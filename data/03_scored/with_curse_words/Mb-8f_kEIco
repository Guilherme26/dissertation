hey what's gonna have the YouTube this is SEL zero t20 zjv I swam back,0.12501824
here again for another review I told you I was making a slew of reviews,0.15225184
throughout this week because I am trying to get down and narrow down to my,0.14790234
top 10 list I just finished watching moonlight this is a movie by Barry Jenkins,0.10046474
I don't know if the beer drink is actually wrote it and directed I believe,0.07470631
he did do the screenplay but this was a masterfully directed film I do know,0.10093956
that Naomi Harris who plays chyrons mother when it's named Paula she's the mother of,0.13589486
this and then Marsala Ally both of them got nominated for Golden Globe nominations I,0.068504095
was very curious to see you know the depths of their their very much so,0.08417862
well acclaimed I guess roles in this but the ones this handed out for me,0.15245053
was you know all the different actors that play chyron trivanti did an amazing job,0.09036906
as the older version of Iran and in his element and kind of gone through,0.080223344
the circumstances of everything and as well as Andre Holland which Kevin and Sharon have,0.09347346
an interest in history the reason why Tron goes by the alias of black is,0.114074506
because he called him that then I believe what was the other guy's name I,0.08970927
think it was a Sean Ashton Sanders who plays the middle version of chyron did,0.08379405
amazing long story short they all did an amazing job with their performance as this,0.0875948
man cared because the character unlike normal conventional films is very conflicted I mean he's,0.15364514
dealing with poverty he's dealing with the mother there's got a substance abuse issues it,0.17828308
comes in to addiction that becomes into just a life altering situation where he doesn't,0.074013434
know when he's gonna live or stay and his mother is just so unstable that,0.57932657
is heart-wrenching to actually really watch because that happens all the time I mean like,0.05771861
depending on where you grew up you know I'm saying like you would see something,0.06778231
like this and this is the thing about the film and what I have to,0.038003255
give credits do for Barry Jenkins this does not feel like a film this like,0.09737163
talking about like a random book story this seems like they went straight up you,0.18456794
know I'm saying to a specific location and just film the life of a person,0.14925088
this is what I mean a lot of people love boyhood I love boyhood but,0.13325034
this takes boyhood and goes here you can't see my hand because this like the,0.23997347
actors commit to the environment I think it's a place in the 1980s if I'm,0.09500426
not mistaken but they commit to it like it's so believable the dialogue the personas,0.089130536
the environment it's like I mean like I don't even know how the actors were,0.15438096
able to commit that well and that's the thing even the cinematography it adds more,0.07204961
immersion in a lot of different ways where like you might have like you know,0.10423605
chyron has a young adult he's just getting chased down the block and you don't,0.25741976
know where he's gonna go and just feel scary you know and then when he,0.17828773
is an adult and you know you know I'm saying like he's a big dude,0.31109077
now like who's gonna really get some you know but he's got all its insecurities,0.08784203
in himself he's tormented in his mind and the biggest thing about this movie this,0.18348904
the underlying theme that I haven't brought brought up at all is the fact that,0.06314757
this is very much so dealing with homosexuality and homophobia homosexuality in the sense that,0.53490317
Iran is a character that that is something that he's from know what age was,0.08875603
maybe 8 or 9 like his mother was really teetering him with the prospect of,0.23763214
that and then this one random guy who plays volley of one decides to be,0.15124184
his surrogate father in the midst of his adolescence of understanding who he is and,0.1033843
that's where Ali does an amazing job like he is an amazing surrogate father he's,0.08043558
not the father but he's an amazing surrogate father and her as a mom she's,0.37681264
just a total opposite I was this like but there are the thing about it,0.10689849
there's certain things that happen with those two characters that I didn't expect towards the,0.04308592
middle of John's life everything shifts where things just get completely worse that's how it,0.13700315
is well high school no matter what it's like that's where the the moments will,0.105334826
break you or forge you through the fire essential and he went unfortunately through both,0.31427112
where's his mother she just was gone and then on top of that wand was,0.32482767
gone and it was like dang what is he gonna become you know and his,0.16851431
is interesting back and forth with this character Kevin especially in the middle part it,0.035326313
was like something terrible happened and it put him on his platform whereas like he's,0.23511039
just a pitfall essentially you know and he becomes honestly what one was even though,0.071514495
Wang was a good father and stuff like that so I could father he was,0.10054144
a drug dealer and there's consequences with that lifestyle that you lead and this film,0.3606293
does not end you know and the happiest of the lucky ways but going back,0.079331316
to the aspect of homosexuality in sense with chyron he not that he hated himself,0.6496726
but he did not know how to you know make it through this situation cuz,0.08828376
he didn't have mom so he doesn't have anybody it was like from jump like,0.14531215
people were just ready to attack him you know and you know I think Wan,0.800836
knew that his mother knew that they didn't know how he was gonna make it,0.15021132
you know but he did he had to go through these circumstances that platform them,0.069988854
into this next this next level as a man and it's very it's very deep,0.27719915
it's a rough film it's a rough though I mean I think that for people,0.19971436
that deal with worrying or a little slight homophobia there are some very explicit scenes,0.29917157
there's some scenes there was a slight you know but the thing about it they,0.042741314
don't this is the thing this is the this is the quintessential thing to I,0.08441578
respect about this film is that there are there's a lot underlying theme of you,0.11652369
know the the understanding of his own homosexuality his sexuality as understanding as being a,0.53490317
man very much so and where they could have taken a lot of gory scenes,0.2399077
or not grotesque or sensual scenes of having like sex all over the place and,0.6575517
everything with different people you know and they didn't do that they use tact they,0.07046127
use very well placed in a Matar fee to not even show necessarily any nudity,0.256086
but it was very much so things that are implied and that's where I said,0.057017468
there's a warning there but I respect the director and the way that they crafted,0.08731075
this film there is no nudity like the scenes that show the sensual connection or,0.20882973
chemistry between like Kevin or chyron or other people are all done through scenes through,0.06338138
acting there's just one specific scene which I run and Kevin when they're adults in,0.061281823
the diner or even when they're in a car and you could tell there were,0.10367339
some definite little emotional triggers that were happening whereas they could have kind of just,0.09391204
like made it really uncomfortable and cringe-worthy they just decided to commit to it from,0.19866578
dialogue and through eye contact and through nuances of confusion it's like you get to,0.15221582
see ty run out of his element in in his element and knowing himself as,0.15609938
an adult and not knowing what he's gonna become and there's very interesting ride very,0.1336043
well executed film ten out of ten yeah it's not a film you can sit,0.161178
there and watch over and over again though because it's very heavy but definitely one,0.1071436
of the better films I've seen this year so the last film I got to,0.057002783
check out be probably man chest about to see or hex or ridge I don't,0.1475107
know if I can stomach hex or Ridge tonight and Manchester by sea I've heard,0.07864024
it's very depressing so I might just kind of cut in for tonight but hopefully,0.417285
y'all did enjoy my review for moonlight keep it alive JV I swear you'll stop,0.37702763
