perfect all that fun stuff let's have a nice lively discussion as for me this,0.09710811
was one of my most anticipated movies going into 2018 it was in my top,0.08161468
10 video that I made and I was very very happy with the movie that,0.0837729
John Krasinski delivered with that said let's talk about the good and the best thing,0.0970606
about this movie is that it just manages to build this sense of tension throughout,0.086943775
the entire movie right from the very beginning of the film it just screeched this,0.076668724
atmosphere where you know anything could happen that creates a sound and it could go,0.089655794
horribly wrong and right from the get-go it establishes the stakes the world around us,0.18376772
and the rules for how we need to function it establishes right out of the,0.09137871
gate this means the whole rest of the movie we have this sense of tension,0.083026424
and deep emotion from beginning to end and the reason this works is the premise,0.06966916
is very simple and straightforward there's creatures that attacks sound so if humans make noise,0.15179656
they will die very simple setup and it's the story that only is talking about,0.3544821
one family it's not trying to explore the ramifications in the world it's not trying,0.078294285
to tell a story about civilizations and decline it's a simple story about a family,0.058177665
trying to survive in this very simple premise and what that means is that we,0.05895463
notice all the details throughout the story because we're not being distress did buy all,0.06320345
the dialogue sorts of things well you notice all the details throughout the film in,0.052992035
order to show you a small detail a toy something at the house something making,0.17299552
that could potentially make some noise and instantly you feel all the tension because you,0.19017477
see everything that can go wrong with that in with that and with that doubt,0.10133491
the whole movie and as it goes through things Kaczynski will just linger for just,0.059843678
a second too long on something and by too long I mean so you're you,0.18227854
know you're supposed to notice it too long in the right sense and so you,0.10249705
see it and you can just get this lingering sense of Doom surrounding the smallest,0.14275418
details about this house about the family about the little choices that they make and,0.032312773
it just builds this incredible sense of tension and the way it's crafted as a,0.091896646
movie is that it starts out kind of slow as we're building the world what,0.09066524
does their life look like what's the dynamics of the family what have they gone,0.08227777
through what are the hurts and pains of being in this scenario and then it,0.11303593
gets going and once it gets going it just does not let up for the,0.07748058
entire life second half of the movie it just is so tense and you can,0.084957816
just see all the things that could potentially go wrong with the scenario they're going,0.081319876
in it's a movie this is so wonderfully crafted to take full advantage of every,0.10115189
scenario that would happen with the world that they built that the scenario that these,0.09267961
characters are and and the acting thread is just great the use of sound is,0.031914044
wonderful the use of music is great and the thing that I knew going into,0.06430049
it that it was going to have some great thrills to it because I'd heard,0.07048624
that from everyone they didn't seen it what I didn't realize going into it is,0.037466176
the level of emotional depth that it would be able to pull out of this,0.07052914
situation it find the little details the the right dynamics they're just the whole movie,0.055765603
there's this deep sense of emotion throughout the whole thing and that's what made this,0.03594821
movie so satisfying as you went through this journey and that has so little dialogue,0.14906207
but you feel so much without it needing to be set that's what that's great,0.10417222
filmmaking and that's a great example of what you can do with cinema where it's,0.057821877
a visual storytelling format and this is a movie that uses the visuals so wonderfully,0.04895953
and it's almost a perfect movie but not quite there's some problems with the movie,0.100537404
so move on to the bag is very few issues here and I can't go,0.095024936
too many details into it because it the two problems with it would be some,0.10844773
of the stuff where they go to the resolution where they try to tie everything,0.07323229
up and give you a satisfactory conclusion comes off a little bit contrived a little,0.13776185
bit like it's a movie that knows it needs to kind of come to a,0.18796359
satisfying conclusion and so the logic has to cheat a little bit with what they,0.186941
show you with the amount of kind of backstory the amount of time that's passed,0.11319857
in this world it feels a little bit like it doesn't think she did a,0.15151046
little bit That's not me that's what I can't don't want to say too much,0.12674306
about it that's all I'll say cut about that one and then the second problem,0.08985209
time somewhat directly to that in the last ten minutes once again because they wanted,0.062352665
to have that nice satisfactory conclusion it feels a little bit out of step with,0.102965
some of what happens in the final ten minutes what I wanted to say too,0.08796842
much if you've seen the movie you probably know what I'm talking about feels a,0.08039464
little bit out of step but these are very minor criticisms of the movie ah,0.15211244
here's what I'll say this is a movie that is within inches of fully accomplishing,0.076142505
its ambitions it's a movie that was trying to be one thing and it's this,0.10653131
close to being a perfect version of that they just had to cheat just a,0.2052737
little bit to get it get it there I'm gonna give this one an A,0.08847553
and an honor to tamp entertainment level I would give this one a 9 out,0.0942072
of 10 it delivered absolutely the experience I wanted I had a blast with this,0.07741547
movie it's it's not a movie that's trying to be the greatest of all time,0.11928405
but for the movie it's trying to be it does an excellent job of executing,0.20966971
