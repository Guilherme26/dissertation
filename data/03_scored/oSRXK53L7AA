hi everyone its Alisa and this is always in a mistake the place that encourages,0.14039144
you to go out get dressed up and watch a movie so today I am,0.29312682
reviewing the shape of water and I had been looking forward to seeing this film,0.09909932
for such a long time now and it really did not disappoint me so the,0.098263115
film star is Sally Hawkins Michael Shannon Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer and it's directed,0.08346022
by the visionary guillermo del toro and this is such a unique story but it,0.05972588
really does have a traditional fairy tale arc that's what it is essentially and it,0.03686756
feels like little bits of beauty and the beast' and maybe even ET and some,0.3219347
cinderella it's just a conglomeration of a lot of different types of fairy tales but,0.28210565
it really does have its own unique vision and to me this is magical realism,0.10982226
done right so the film is about Eliza who's played by Sally Hawkins a mute,0.15120876
woman who works as a cleaning woman in a secretive research facility in Baltimore during,0.40333033
the early 1960s she lives in a world of routine where she's been marginalized as,0.15294422
a result of her inability to speak her only friends are two other marginalized people,0.5527618
Giles played by Richard Jenkins and Zelda played by Octavia Spencer Giles is a game,0.054789912
man who's trying to find love at a later stage in his life and then,0.17182393
Zelda is an african-american woman during the civil rights movement and she has her own,0.24070096
marriage to worry about where her husband treats her more like a servant than anything,0.24090819
else so suffice it to say these three characters they really are so isolated and,0.161761
they dream of something much bigger in life and so then one day when they,0.14785092
are at the research facility there is this new asset that comes and that's what,0.033173256
they call this amphibian creature that this character Richard Strickland who is played by Michael,0.23864679
Shannon had found when he was in South America and of course they feel like,0.065941155
they need to capture him back and this is during the Cold War so they,0.120188735
feel like this can be an asset for them and how can they use this,0.05985504
amphibian creature against the Russians and that's their whole purpose and bringing it back but,0.27259645
when Eliza sees this creature she has immediate empathy and compassion for him because he,0.25881785
feels like one of her own he's not able to communicate he's by himself he's,0.40334812
totally isolated and while in the beginning he is so afraid of every move and,0.14131069
action taken by her her kind actions he can't begin to show him that he,0.18098782
can actually trust her and what develops is a really beautiful relationship where they start,0.09956018
to communicate via sign language and really just through certain looks and gestures but then,0.07138255
it even goes further into this kind of romantic love that the two characters have,0.064510584
for each other and the whole purpose of the film or one of the messages,0.0469165
at least is that you don't always need this kind of verbal language to communicate,0.10878974
love and that often it's a gesture book that actually means more and is more,0.07927066
loving than anything that words can ever say and so it really does develop into,0.071322344
this beautiful love story which you may not expect going into it and this is,0.08116604
definitely the kind of movie that people are either going to love or they're going,0.14342788
to hate there are definitely a couple of reactions in the film where you could,0.24108201
hear audience members going and I'm not sure you know if that was an appositive,0.0666072
or a negative way but I'm sure that it's getting both positive and negative reactions,0.09702061
based on what the storyline is about so you know it was really such a,0.06398382
rich and gorgeous looking film the characters are well developed for the most part and,0.07755199
I'll get to that later and I cannot overemphasize the genuine and heartbreaking performance given,0.079214446
by Sally Hawkins so at this point I've seen most of the frontrunners for Best,0.059991233
Actress and now I have to say that I really believe sally hawkins deserves to,0.083378606
win for Best Actress there is nothing else I can say but fearless her performance,0.14712945
is absolutely fearless it's so emotionally vulnerable she goes to certain places in herself where,0.17828009
she has to be just so open and comfortable with herself and and she does,0.1283441
it with the greatest of ease or at least seemingly so and the character has,0.031246329
so much depth but it's so subtle in the way that she creates all of,0.118039966
the depth in this character and it's the performance is so much it's in her,0.084018275
eyes it's in her facial expressions the way that she will sign she just gives,0.27149308
so much of herself to this performance and I've seen her in several other roles,0.092066646
and she's always been grained she was really a claim for happy-go-lucky but this is,0.15194863
her performance this is a break out for her in a way that I've never,0.15335852
seen before she is spectacular in this movie and I'm getting chills thinking about it,0.14342979
and if she doesn't win for Best Actress I really am going to be upset,0.11836453
because she just she 100% deserves it and you know she really has to create,0.21995726
this very real relationship with this amphibian creature which I'm sure was not easy but,0.17558415
she just buys into the role 100% so everything about it feels genuine with this,0.088234745
relationship with this amphibian type creature who's certainly a few steps above us on the,0.19085345
evolutionary ladder so in the hands of a lesser actress the character could have come,0.12547223
off as a character caricature I mean you really have to believe this relationship is,0.10247056
real and true and I'm not sure that that many actresses would have had the,0.079146534
emotional openness to execute the premise of this story and with that said I have,0.11425383
to give praise to duck Jones as well who plays this amphibian creature and while,0.2772923
he is in this suit and there's some CGI on his you still feel this,0.18338262
kind of emotional honesty and I just cared about the creature so very much and,0.12626924
it makes all the difference in the world that this isn't just CGI you can,0.057829607
tell that there is a human there and it makes that connection between the two,0.05062264
characters all the more real and if they didn't have that this film just wouldn't,0.0752391
have worked at all but of course it's it's Guillermo del Toro and he never,0.08346337
would have allowed for something like that to happen and in fact all of the,0.070233956
performances in this movie are just standouts and Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer they definitely,0.09396483
deserve the nominations for the Golden Globes I hope they get it for the Academy,0.14861265
Awards as well and they also provide some much-needed levity to the movie and that,0.10784842
was one of the things that surprised me is that the movie is actually quite,0.062403835
funny at times and it's funny mainly because of these two characters so Richard Jenkins,0.08172437
is just so charming and appealing even though you can feel this guy who hasn't,0.15075327
really gotten what he wanted from life and maybe made some mistakes in the past,0.076484695
and you know wants to be himself his true sense himself but this society he'd,0.15091097
that he's in does it really let it happen but the friendship that forms between,0.080142625
his character and Eliza is just beautiful and they watch these musicals together and they're,0.06958035
just so sweet and their interactions and then Octavia Spencer is just so funny in,0.109734304
the movie but her character also has so much depth as she kind of provides,0.10515487
this traditional love relationship and showing how that doesn't always work because she fell in,0.09629523
love with her husband because he was just so attractive and now she's at the,0.16239895
point where it feels like she's just taking care of this aging baby and has,0.24097735
to wait on him hand and foot and what she thought was love doesn't really,0.13604832
work out for her in the way that that she wanted and so both of,0.098107696
these friends are just non-judgmental especially Richard Jenkins character and just very accepting of Eliza,0.094688155
I would say though that Michael Shannon is very good in the film although the,0.04299369
way his character is written he doesn't really have that much depth so you know,0.07597121
while he certainly plays into the fairy tale aspect of the story I couldn't help,0.07415365
but want to feel a bit of empathy for him but alas there really was,0.09117702
none for this character and one of the most underrated performances in the film is,0.041700523
by Michael Starbuck who plays a scientist who's working at the facility and he is,0.11172246
very empathetic to the creature and looks at him with respect and wanting to actually,0.17147699
learn something from him but not treat him poorly and I felt that character was,0.18354855
very well developed and and there are a lot of great moments with his character,0.045616806
and I haven't heard about him in the film as much but he's just he's,0.07234418
wonderful in it as well and this film is just so beautiful looking this is,0.088450134
just one of the most beautiful beautifully shot thumbs that I've seen all year when,0.12191556
you look you go into the apartment buildings and they have this kind of old,0.24005382
opulence but they are deteriorate deteriorating with age a little bit and there's something so,0.13972421
historical and beautiful about these locations and what I loved is that the color palettes,0.08054725
were kind of all over the place but in a good way you might be,0.09055474
in the diner and one shot and it has this complimentary color palette of red,0.09127382
and green and it really was reminiscent of onwe in that sense and the tone,0.06496291
and the feeling but then the next shot the next scene is monochromatic and really,0.18111119
each shot symbolizes the state of the setting you know so when the film started,0.123617075
I got the immediate sense that it was one of those movies that was just,0.090373784
made for me with the quirky and endearing score the protagonist who lives above a,0.10173337
movie theater and then this distinctive color palette throughout and what's incredible is that this,0.051022638
movie only cost twenty million dollars when I was watching it it just looks so,0.039987713
expensive rich I couldn't believe the budget when I have looked it up it's just,0.07280679
so gorgeous and there are a lot of elements of the film that kind of,0.054278605
reminded me of well and strangely enough in that sense of going back and taking,0.07666284
a certain genre of film from like the 40s 50s 60s and rejuvenating it in,0.041801356
some way and modernizing that kind of fairy tale so it's certainly not a Disney,0.10153598
fairy tale in in any way shape or form and it definitely Murs more of,0.073695295
like the Grimm's brother fairy tale it's you know very explicit it's very violent in,0.24870473
certain parts and you you know that you're watching a guillermo del toro movie for,0.24365786
sure when you're watching this it was just really great to see this style of,0.070581935
fairy tale style but done in such an adult way now I can't say that,0.07934864
every single aspect of this movie was perfect I had a couple of problems with,0.19486025
it some had to do with the plot I thought that some characters acted in,0.055590995
a very unbelievable way to their character and I know that might sound ridiculous considering,0.4694105
we're living in this world of magical realism but this genre still has the word,0.11073692
realism in it meaning that I can accept all of the magic that you're giving,0.11080364
me in this world and and that's the circumstances with this amphibian creature I can,0.21440844
accept and love all of that but the characters still need to move be motivated,0.036764503
in a way that they would act genuinely and I felt like sometimes the characters,0.04459959
said things or did things just to move the plot forward and I felt it,0.06868751
was more of a storytelling technique rather than being genuine to the character and perhaps,0.032763552
when they were writing this they could have found a different way to get to,0.052737966
that ending I kind of had a bit of a problem with how they had,0.13849024
to get to the ending and also like I had said before him with Michael,0.10409944
Shannon's character you know he's a villain but to me villains really do have some,0.18043756
kind of backstory and some sort of reason for why they are the way they,0.066522874
are and here it really is like Richard is just a sign of the times,0.06798885
and he's this uber masculine male but you know maybe I just wanted a little,0.19127458
bit more and that's maybe more about personal preference but none of that should take,0.10778309
away from the movie it's it's so enjoyable and it's so beautiful and I think,0.19170745
this is Guillermo del Toro's best movie now I love Pan's Labyrinth but I felt,0.09757059
like this one maybe had a little bit more heart and it was you know,0.13009886
very much about love and exemplary of the times that were living in a lot,0.09978994
of you know the conflicts that are coming up in the film definitely have parallels,0.0657129
to what's going on in our world right now and it just was so you,0.10104373
know beautiful and thought-provoking but at some times and this is just another negative criticism,0.10529442
sometimes it was a little bit obvious a little bit obvious with the symbolism for,0.091113135
example you don't necessarily need to tell me the entire story of Samson and Delilah,0.1546404
and Delilah you can just mention that illusion and then people either know it or,0.061958153
they look it up after you don't need to have the like symbolism sort of,0.0989316
shoved in your face which definitely does happen in the film but all in all,0.39995903
this is definitely going to be in my top 10 list of movies for the,0.05849125
year and you should certainly watch it in the movie theater and now for the,0.060014345
green so for film and artistry which is how you know artistic it is but,0.03859742
also takes into consideration the performances and the writing and how it fits into the,0.05504475
genre I would give the shape of water and a it is such a beautiful,0.06340318
film with just knocked out performances like I said sally hawkins better wood and fur,0.1395227
best actress but you know maybe there were a couple of flaws that i saw,0.10785656
with this script that doesn't make it a perfect movie for me and then in,0.06355367
terms of watchability i would also give the shape of water and hey some of,0.060982384
those problems with the plot that that on a personal level just kind of irks,0.25427967
me a little bit but all in all I love this film it's one of,0.24091576
the best of the year and I just thought it was so beautiful and not,0.09342478
to give anything away but the last 20 minutes of the film are just they're,0.07362179
absolutely gorgeous so please go and watch this movie so if you have seen it,0.1517234
leave a comment below and if you liked the video please give me a like,0.17076893

nominated as possible just so I can be well-rounded when all of the awards fodder,0.0986624
kind of comes out so thank you so much for watching and remember it is,0.054280926
