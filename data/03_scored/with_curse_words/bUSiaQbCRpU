these you're gonna get four because there's part for tight let's talk about the directing,0.09833945
/ visuals this film is directed by Josh Cooley and I have to say his,0.085356966
directing style mixed in with these visual was on point probably the best visually looking,0.07251508
choice stories I've ever seen hands down do to 2019 this is keeping one honey,0.08023786
we're not a ninety five but this film just looked so good the CG was,0.10410989
just phenomenal the movement was crisp the the colors were popping it was very vibrant,0.09244293
it just looked that damn good and shout out to you Josh because you did,0.7093121
a good job directing this movie and I really appreciate it the way you directed,0.13260405
it you you did your best to make the Oder audience feel what the younger,0.05883745
audience is about to feel you know I mean we're older now I was there,0.036685616
95 baby you don't say it and for me to come in and still get,0.18686616
some of that direction where it feels familiar I like that and I appreciate you,0.047378693
for doing that the visuals on point it's Toy Story for baby Oh point let's,0.099861965
talk about the music Randy Newman came back to do the music for tour story,0.06869354
for and I have to say with the much up respect for any look me,0.0840929
because no one could do it like this clearly I will go say no more,0.10317976
no one could do that like when you Norman Newman but this music was whack,0.39681068
in this film did not care for him at all in this movie he was,0.10921735
a shell of what that in 95 was it just did not feel organic new,0.10007263
vibrant it felt like let's throw him in to make people feel like the old-school,0.40315568
Toy Story and that's what the much up respect no disrespect to him at all,0.14890413
but it was just like shut up I'm done this music does not this film,0.45267144
does not deserve Randy Newman in this at all it's not a Randy Newman type,0.21303612
of movie it just did not feel right it felt forced it was like alright,0.10848588
we get it we get it you want to bring up a familiar voice music-wise,0.07633859
to this to the story I did I understand it but wrong movie for this,0.07717345
music I just I was like honey shut up goddang stop singing I felt like,0.520453
Family Guy on apocalypse episode y'all know back then it was like stop it huh,0.18425773
gosh freak alright let's talk about the story let's talk about the script story this,0.3068605
story was created by eight individuals yes eight people had their hands in the cookie,0.11401541
jar and it felt like eight people had their hands in the cookie jar this,0.1493071
was a terrible disrespectful spit in the face story and the reason why because it,0.5154597
felt like these eight individuals didn't know where they were going and why they were,0.08261851
doing it and what Toy Story really meant to the viewers I don't compare films,0.11063044
but this is a fourth installment of previously being one of the most epic franchises,0.09980789
ever one of the most epic trilogies ever and because of this story it has,0.053455338
tainted this epic Toy Story franchise for me this story was rushed pointless and disconnecting,0.4072425
to me as a viewer I've watched Toy Story and adored the stories of Toy,0.06666054
Story since 95 and I'm keeping one honey cuz I don't want to get emotional,0.087019086
but Toy Story is very emotional to me because I collect toys I love toys,0.15516579
and since 95 it has always been one of my favorites I go and watch,0.060921397
Toy Story when I feel is sad when I'm angry alongside with Land Before Time,0.07036466
I love those movies and when you when you watch it and you see the,0.08082953
trash and the disrespect that they give them characters like wait and Buzz and they,0.53490317
just sit on them and just put their fit and a step on those characters,0.23970868
oh it's disrespectful and I hate it I hate it and I'm pissed off because,0.67975396
I didn't ask for this movie but I was willing to give it a chance,0.051494602
because I honestly was like yo you know it's cool let's find out what happened,0.10798526
to Bo Peep I'm okay with both peeping in his movie I'm gonna carry with,0.13495286
Bo Peep in his movie but the disrespect to woody my favorite character and how,0.07219956
they set him back in this story and just pushed agenda after agenda I couldn't,0.06394393
I didn't understand you I'm like why I didn't go in this movie looking for,0.120716706
something I was just giving something and how it just disconnected with me I just,0.1153103
felt bad for me and the future of kids this story was terrible this is,0.17369013
not a good movie when it comes to story and script they try to force,0.1193048
emotion in this movie they got emotion they got anger not happiness or sadness I'm,0.14182192
pissed off by this trash story Toy Story 1 myths under to me it meant,0.7714612
something because I understood it the development of how they came up with this movie,0.07472903
was phenomenal a toy gets replaced let's tell a story about how a toy feels,0.097450644
when they get replaced and how every other everything around it enjoys the new you,0.2773467
know I'm saying they enjoy that sheet and seeing woody get replaced and having to,0.19143748
overcome that and going with witty through his journey to become friends with buzz I,0.092019886
thought was tight yo I'm like that's real life that's how it happens you could,0.14652355
be the top dude in school and somebody cooler comes and everyone loves that cool,0.09063238
guy and they kind of put you in the back and you're like I got,0.19100425
it I'm cool too don't remember me and how you two become friends after all,0.12820612
that she and become best friends it's beautiful Toy Story 2 becoming a collectible that's,0.14686905
a life span of a toy you get so old you become a collectible as,0.578884
beautiful seeing woody my favorite character become a collectible item not knowing where he came,0.08754421
from figuring out all this stuff and accepting the circumstances and his friends coming to,0.054343764
rescue him because they know he was stolen and then not just that they go,0.15028635
through an epic journey I'm playing catch with my dad they go to a toy,0.15871733
store just beautiful and then it is with it is with it ends with part,0.10213916
three what happens to a toy when you grow up most toys get thrown away,0.27193683
so we're giving away they gave the toys away to a freaking daycare and seeing,0.574145
how the toys interact from being number one to being wrecked by little kids spit,0.53456336
on toe up just tow the toys up and lots o to bear bro just,0.15357414
being a hater seeing the journey find a way back to Andy's house and then,0.15667094
what are you doing you just grow out of your toys you find another little,0.37382182
kid and you give your toys away you give your toys away to somebody else,0.31143308
because you cherish that I still got my first teddy bear sitting right there I,0.30893704
9ne call me selfish I'm doing a sheep but I understand they give they towards,0.2221433
the bunny and she loves the toys and then we get this trash story and,0.48055217
part 4 where she makes a fork spoon 40 sport whatever and she loves the,0.17640144
sport more than those toys and he doesn't want to be a toy he keeps,0.15321195
running away and what he keeps putting himself in lost danger to keep retrieving this,0.11915098
stupid fork this is stupid fork it has nothing to do with anything Toy Story,0.85985386
related this was a disgrace and despicable trash story /script i enjoyed by a bow,0.7093121
peace journey but goddamn what about woody they sad all over witty he took the,0.73992044
back seat in this new world we live in and I'm gonna say and I,0.12399478
try not to say because I try to see the brighter side of life but,0.08724084
this whack sjw nlgger that we dealing with I'm sick of it I am sick,0.74519366
of it I am tired of it they set woody back wait he is a,0.18000898
leader and I would have loved to see winning a boat people eat together not,0.1908125
him sit in a backside this man this toy has found his way home three,0.60510665
films and alone TV specials and now he just wrecked body needs us body nlgger,0.48867065
Fred Barney men trash story trash script I can't believe that Disney milked a cow,0.60451275
like this is so hurting I was there in 95 yo I was there when,0.1535764
it all began me and my little brother VHS the mobile big old dick man,0.8785311
Toy Story had the best line of stories anybody could ask for and Disney this,0.059172217
is the third and this is a third franchise they have ruined with their agenda,0.15673934
based films trying to please an audience who don't even watch these films who don't,0.2406359
even buy these toys who don't even care about these characters stop appealing to people,0.24353813
who don't even have we don't care about this nlgger and it hurts when you,0.53490317
hear when you watch and you see what they have done to Toy Story God,0.07054259
leave and I told dr. C and I told David I was like why I,0.1207816
gotta be to win cuz it just sucks that no one is speaking on this,0.794439
crash Toy Story 4 story is script it just just pissed all over what they,0.2940653
had they brought to life and I hate it this is the worst toy story,0.42992046
film period it has good elements but overall Toy Story meant something it wasn't it,0.06475507
didn't mean something visually it means something just by the acting the voice act nah,0.04501478
it was the story that made you feel something in the way part 3 ended,0.070166476
with that story man then it came this trash dan let's talk about pros let's,0.5413843
talk about cons the pros of this film is the voice acting I thought the,0.13947493
voice actors did a phenomenal job vibrant like I said Keegan stole the show from,0.31089434
me he was funny breath of fresh air I wish they had you're keeping the,0.15129635
Jordan Peele and keegan-michael key and the other toy stories I thought they would have,0.05663633
brought something magical to that because I felt like out of everybody else even even,0.14967178
though I love Tom Hanks I felt that they took a backseat and key and,0.11070218
Peele really cared about being in this movie more than any other voice actors to,0.086627536
me everything they did hit hard it was like okay all right just everything about,0.33988136
them from that voice was just there and you could tell that the way they,0.06537304
came off they really wanted to be part of this and to me it felt,0.19002084
like to them it wasn't just a job it was let's let's try to make,0.098640285
this tight I think I could put my swag on this and be tight let's,0.25207177
talk about the cons the story the disconnecting factor of this story is a con,0.24237292
for me hearing all these these people raving over this movie oh my god it,0.40327746
was so hard Phil oh my god I feel so bad miss me with that,0.19493797
trash this story was garbage and it messed this whole movie up I don't want,0.63749224
to spoil anything but there were certain scenes in here that I was like why,0.079562046
did you do that why would you do that why would you frickin do that,0.6662828
that doesn't make any sense who does that we live in a world that is,0.10554283
falling apart and I'm seeing it through film first we cannot keep appealing to people,0.18489864
who don't even care who just want to be seen who don't care about anything,0.17894907
else but just being seen this agenda based stuff and these movies look every every,0.07134267
film even back in the day everything had an agenda but you know what there,0.060391
was one thing about class and agenda this film had no class with his agenda,0.14773141
we got very little of the crew another kind I come to see woody buzz,0.17477044
Rex slinky Jesse bullseye I came to see my favorite characters and I didn't even,0.19087122
get them I got all these new characters which I had I liked the duck,0.27400047
in a rabbit but damn what about everybody else we spent too much time on,0.6484006
a spork a trash eating loving land in dirt spork that was the spit in,0.5130563
the face disconnected immediately I just can't take it I am very sad what they,0.11708578
have done with this let's give this film a grade I love the voice acting,0.09497797
they did a phenomenal job the directing was cool visually dope you know I'm saying,0.18332262
2019 they got the money they got the works it's gonna look tight but this,0.07436227
movie doesn't base off of action and tight looking boys acting means something but the,0.08693665
story is script and the musical just was not there it just wasn't there and,0.050510947
it hurts because you need music to build the climactic scenes so you can feel,0.13886712
the emotions you need a good story to blend in with the music so you,0.07527249
can feel the emotions that's the beauty of Toy Story because it doesn't matter how,0.08142853
old you are what color you are what race you are what we're living you,0.37744525
believe in we all had toys before that's the beauty of Toy Story it's one,0.120185725
of the one things that everybody can appreciate a love for toy and watching that,0.07992915
journey and they just sit it all on that cebra and I can't believe how,0.08059703
they did them just milking the cow like what the Freak why would you do,0.4630309
that with that said y'all I'm gonna give this movie got my hands moving in,0.105475076
so you gotta hear I'm trying to hold it in I'm gonna give this movie,0.112469696
a c-minus is the worst Toy Story film this movie gets a c-minus it is,0.4183591
