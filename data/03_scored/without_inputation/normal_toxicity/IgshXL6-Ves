I finally got to see a star is born,0.052213777
and I have to say this is so far the best film of the year mind you we still have two months in the year left and we still have award season coming where there will be lots of oscar-nominated films coming out,0.061887376
so there's still a chance for it to be dethroned,0.06562329
but right now it is the running leader and this film was great,0.054867283
so this is actually the third remake of a star is born the original was in 1937,0.049948916
then they remade that in 1954 with Judy Garland and again in 1976 with a Barbra Streisand now I have not seen any of the other versions of this film I've only seen this version,0.08915237
and I think that is probably the best way to see this movie,0.08383021
so you don't have preconceived notions of what it should be like,0.084633775
and also the story won't get ruined for you,0.15219754
so this movie stars Bradley Cooper from silver linings playbook American hustle American sniper lots of great films,0.14690328
but he's also the director of this film,0.15542385
and this is his directorial debut and he definitely did a good job Lady Gaga is the lead actress in this film she's been in a few films before she was in machete kills as well as the Sin City sequel movie sin city a dame to kill for,0.4855881
but this is her first kind of real acting role where she is the lead and a lot of the burden is on her to perform well so she did really well in this film she sings,0.1451385
so many songs,0.0788577
and she obviously is a great singer,0.08194914
and the song sounds great,0.052088175
she was also really good as an actress in this film she really carried some emotional beats by herself very well so the overall plot to this film,0.17288679
if you don't know what it is is that Bradley Cooper is a famous singer but he's also an alcoholic and a drug addict and he seems to be kind of running out of fumes in his music career,0.5681359
and he happens to stumble upon this random bar one night and he sees Lady Gaga perform,0.19358604
and she is in unknown singer,0.1078416
she is just performing for fun at this place,0.16441739
but Bradley Cooper becomes really enthralled by her and he thinks that she is this great singer,0.0765546
so he invites her to one of his concerts where he drags her on stage and makes her sing and she really starts to blow up and the relationship really starts to blossom and they fall in love and you really believe they're in love in this film you really have some tender moments between the two of them and as their relationship develops and deepens we see Lady Gaga's career in this film start to blow up and Bradley Cooper's drug problems and alcohol problems really start affecting him,0.14088237
so what makes this a great film it's not just the singing,0.1542749
in fact I wouldn't say this movie is really a musical,0.08880101
it is more of a drama there is some singing in it,0.118221916
but this is really a dramatic emotional movie there is some very good moments here between Bradley Cooper just making a mess of his life and deteriorating his relationships one great relationship,0.12714605
he has in the film is with his older brother played by Sam Alien and a man Sam Ali,0.24188471
it was amazing in this film as well as the brother some really great emotional moments between the two of them I'm definitely sensing there's going to be a Best Supporting Actor nomination for him,0.06469812
he really killed,0.7747676
it in this film we also have Andrew Dice Clay as Lady Gaga's father and he has some really good interactions with various characters in this film as well Dave Chappelle is in this,0.10823002
and he plays like a singer who is friends with Bradley Cooper's character,0.06302493
and he helps Bradley through a hard point in his life in the film so lots of good supporting actors in this film as well my only real negative of this film is that while the music was great,0.084511146
sometimes it went on a little long,0.066439666
I didn't need to watch Lady Gaga sing a song for three or four minutes I one minute I get the point,0.07731084
she's a great singer,0.07606388
let's move on to the next scene but that's a minor thing still this is a great film,0.06283308
and it was really awesome,0.052297767
all around I'm gonna give this one,0.081891805
