so I also want to take a minute to shout out a rival it just got nominated for some Academy Awards and it's back in the theatres and if you didn't see it the first go-around I encourage you I implore you to go see it this was a science fiction film that was like made for me like honestly I loved it I loved it I I want to go see it again I'm gonna buy it on blu-ray I was really blown away by this movie the thing that sets us apart from other alien invasion movies is that it is a feminine Balian invasion movie you know you have your female main character she's a linguist which is a soft science which would be considered in my opinion a feminine science you know and she uses her skills to figure it out like figure out what's going on you know and bring people together and stop a world war and stop like some horrible from going on and like she becomes the woman that unites humanity for the first time ever and it's just like what a dream like most guys want to be Batman I would like to be that chicken arrival okay like cuz that is like so great I just I'm not gonna talk about the plot but I will say that you know obviously this is an alien invasion movie where you have these aliens that come down humanity does not know whether they are benevolent or malevolent you know we don't know whether they're here to destroy us or to help us with other friends or foes you have the main character she's trying to communicate with these aliens the the military is trying to you know tell her how she can and cannot communicate with them when she's like look you don't know you're not a linguist you don't know you're not really communicators you guys are here for defense and aggressive maneuvers you know like that's like you're not really diplomats here so you know I love the fact that you know they're telling her oh you need to keep the suit on she's like I can't talk to these people with a suit on I need to be a person and talk to them and they're like what just explain this to them and like that's what's really interesting about this is yes it is difficult to try to communicate with aliens and learn a new alien language but it is equally if not more difficult to communicate with her own kind with the military you know because they're so triggered all the time you know I mean they're just waiting for a threat you know and it's just like yeah like her having to not only deal with communicating with them but communicating with the military and showing how hard that would be it was just like oh it's just such a straight like the struggle is real you know like as a woman I've had to try to communicate with giant entities made up of a bunch of men who have no idea how to treat one another and it is  frustrating and there are  crazy and they don't listen to you and they think you're an like this is my job like will you let me do my job you know like God get the out of your own way you know so yeah I really like this movie a lot it's totally I I hope it wins lots of Oscars if you're interested in reading a book that has similar ideas and themes in it check out childhoods end by arthur c clarke that's pretty short it's pretty simple you know there's a lot of stuff that's in that movie that is also in this book that you may enjoy so yeah check out a rival it has the CVG stamp of approval and don't forget to check out my new show greater creators it's airing every Tuesday on go 90 and it's all about some of my favorite creators and how they push the boundaries of art and how their influence can still be felt today these are people you may have seen their work but you don't know their name or may have heard their name but you don't know exactly what they did why they're so awesome so far we have an episode out about Jack Kirby Frank Frazetta just came out he's an amazing badass painter and also Mobius one of the most amazing illustrators and draftsman of all time that just like blows my mind and worked a lot with Jodorowsky he worked on the inkle so yeah check that out definitely for sure oh my god and it's not just on your phone anymore now it's on go 90 calm so it's the platform's always changing you know it's new media now things never every week they change so that's the deal and also I'd like to give a big shout out to my super patrons peers your own of course always you're amazing Tom easy you as well and Natalie England thank you guys so much for your support I really appreciate it without you guys man I don't even know who's gonna ditch somewhere probably so be sure to LIKE this video subscribe to my channel and follow me on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and on YouTube where you already at I think there's a thing where you have to like say that you want to see my updates or something I don't know I don't keep up with that you know it's just every time I turn around they make it harder for you to get your videos out so whatever you gotta do you know
