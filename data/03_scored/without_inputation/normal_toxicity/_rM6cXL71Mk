hello and welcome to episode 235 of the epic film challenge to a thousand one movies you must see before you die from 1950 All About Eve,0.18813615
I really wished I'd made this review,0.1137804
in fact I think they did film a version of this many many weeks ago I've sold this film for the first time six weeks ago and the heatwave hit it was just impossible to film a video,0.081102066
I tried,0.04058157
and it was just a terrible video and there have been so many reviews and videos in this series where I thought you know I'm really happy and proud of that review what I said about the film I articulated myself on why I liked it why I didn't like it had never been plenty of videos where I feel like I've done a really bad job,0.1809955
and this is a film I feel like,0.046973262
I need to do at least a decent job,0.15593958
well because it's it's worth it,0.09433827
it's one of those films,0.1724654
that's really special,0.047906283
and I need to try and convey that in the best way I possibly can,0.04014184
so hopefully,0.07301748
I can still do that even though it's many many weeks since I've saw it,0.04606917
but I will say that you know what six weeks ago since then I've probably seen twenty thirty films maybe more than that and it's more fresh in my mind than most of the films I've seen since then it has that impact,0.07605245
it has that staying power,0.061456814
I've never seen it before had heard about it,0.07581857
one of those classic titles all about Eve Bette Davis and I was assuming that Eve was going to be a character played by Bette Davis but it's not and this film was hugely successful when it came out in 1951 the Academy Award for Best Picture Best Director best script Best Supporting Actor for George Sanders,0.04787254
it's it really just swept the board and was nominated and one other kind of awards as well and it's interesting to me that this film came out in 1950 the same year as a little movie called Sunset Boulevard which they can draw a lot of parallels between those two movies they're both about an aging actress,0.07077299
and you know that there's similar themes they're very different films,0.08055556
but there's a there's a thread of similarity that that kind of joins them together at least of all the fact that they came out in the same year anyway Bette Davis stars as Margo Channing a theatre actress a very famous stage actress who's in her forties now and she's kind of feeling it,0.15001991
you know she's one of those women who are kind of her presence fills up the entire room,0.45670775
she's a very boisterous very kind of a strong strong-willed a strong personality,0.29825464
one of those types of people and but at the same time she does have that kind of sensitivity to her and she does have that kind of jacked out of you know am I getting too old to play these same parts over and over again,0.25457218
you know she's still successful but as far as her own eyes are concerned,0.13907549
and what she sees in the mirror,0.1367464
she can tell that she's getting old or getting older at least,0.19191018
and Eve is a young doe-eyed woman who is besotted with Margo Eve Harrington,0.34680617
she goes to see Margo at the play that she's currently performing in every single day multiple times a day you know she'll see all the performances and she gets taken in she's outside of the theater at the beginning of the movie she gets taken in by Margo's friend like come and meet her you know if you're such a big fan we'll come and see her backstage,0.093191944
oh no no I couldn't,0.05651727
possibly,0.051987533
you know Eva's very meek but she goes backstage and she meets Margo who kind of takes takes a bit of a liking to it,0.1524928
we kind of get to hear Eve's backstory about losing her husband and she kind of you know tells him where she is now in her life and it isn't a very nice story,0.12240935
so Margo takes pity on even says come with me,0.24212535
and you can be my assistant and so Eve is very happy and very glad to take on the the mantle of assisting Margo in any way she can now Margo already has an assistant kind of called birdy played by thalma Ritter and birdy doesn't really trust eat when she comes into the fold and you know very much takes a quick distrust stance to Eve and everything that she seems to be standing for she kind of comes into the you know in into the that the family of actors,0.08135468
and this this theatre life,0.13298675
Thelma Ritter is an awesome actress,0.037147272
I love her in everything I've seen her and she has such character to us,0.07372494
she has such a strong essence,0.102936514
and I see things in her that I've seen in women I've known growing up my life and I'd be very surprised if they'll maritza and real life wasn't what you would call maybe a tough,0.35405856
broad you know she she just has such character to her and it's no different in this film to she's such a joy to watch and I liked,0.15502448
how birdies kind of you know kind,0.13598214
of just looking around the corner,0.05012347
you know kind of so to speak even and what Eve is doing in the household anyway,0.08047606
so this the story is about Margo,0.077013634
and it's about Eve,0.0564498
what I love about this film such a great move,0.03318751
we open with a scene at an award ceremony a very kind of upper-class kind of posh kind of award ceremony for theater,0.09715424
actors,0.060476437
you know very posh stuff,0.13476577
and we see these people sad the tables we see Margo we see the character played by George Sanders,0.064814754
I forget his name,0.03276743
and he's kind of a theater critic,0.14888455
and he's a very very vital character in the story and we kind of hear this narration that's setting up what we're about to see which is the this prestigious award being given to Eve Harrington,0.05088631
so the film kind of spoils at the beginning the Eve goes on to being actress herself,0.099099964
and so I think the real crux of this movie as it progresses,0.10171501
and as it goes on is you thinking as the audience what are Eve's motives,0.09255489
what is she really in this for you know it's birdie right to distrust her you know or we just thinking the worst along with her - and I love that about,0.15147549
it and I love that really Eve isn't in the film that,0.075779244
much I mean she's in it plenty but if you were to take that to our running time and really look at how many minutes she's on screen it's,0.10292667
not I don't think as many as you would expect for someone whose name is in the title of the movie I'd say Margo gets the lion's share of screen credit of the screen,0.051269375
time and I guess screen credit but it's more about,0.03070031
it it's it's in the title All About,0.04377263
Eve let me tell you all about Eve before she gets up to the stage to accept the award that they make the beginning of the film,0.053040996
before we've even seen her on screen we flash back to to Eve outside the theater and being brought in to meet Margo and we see the whole story progressed at the very end of the film we see Eve except the award and so we get to see how that's that kind of that sequence that that's that series of events leads us to her receiving this award loves how they did it a really cool framing device,0.038923368
but also just how we really get a feeling of Eve through other characters perspectives and how they feel about how what they think about what she's doing you know she becomes an assistant to Margo and then you know things progressed from that I don't to spoil too much more of what happens,0.08179217
even though I kind of told you what happens at the beginning which in in effect kind of tells you what happens at the end but it's all about the journey to that destination,0.055304497
and how it happens,0.075927995
why it happens and and what kind of gets destroyed in the process,0.30079168
Bette Davis is unbelievable as Margo Channing,0.18542764
I had one of my favorite performances I think she's so full of fire in this film,0.44539708
you know,0.07163658
there's some really great incredible writing in the film which only lends itself well to insanely quotable lines from the film one that really stood out to me that actually I noted down just so I got a completely ripes,0.13808271
I didn't want to paraphrase it and get it wrong,0.07810073
I have it here on my phone when Margo is having a particularly kind of feisty back and forth with someone she says everyone has a heart,0.12739612
except for some people,0.18001512
that's just a killer line that's such a great line,0.27180758
and there's some really funny witty moments in the film there's a character played by Marilyn Monroe who's this kind of ditzy blonde an aspiring actress she isn't very good and you know the George Sanders character says well you can just go to television you know,0.08867884
and she says tell me did they have auditions for television,0.0978821
and he replies,0.075886704
that's all television is my dear,0.0503916
she's just fantastic line there's lots of kind of funny moments in the film but you're still really invested in this story and what happens and and and and how the characters kind of combust and and into play and everything,0.05623996
and it's an incredible cast of characters and some great actors obviously Marilyn Monroe,0.07287451
I still haven't really seen anything in Maryland where I haven't seen her most famous films,0.10145003
I don't know if she a good actress I couldn't tell you anything about her but the seer in this film was fun but she's a very small role and Baxter as Eve,0.19898145
you know knowing,0.05320393
what happens throughout the whole course of the film,0.06090203
and what her character is where she's from why she's doing what she's doing her performance gets even better once you can know all that backstory,0.1236282
you know because again she seems so meek and innocent at the beginning and and then to see where her true her true intentions lie and how that manifests itself,0.40806058
I thought was was super bleep laid by Anne Baxter,0.3221377
now apparently Anne Baxter kind of put herself forward to be nominated for the the Best Actress Award and they were going to put her for Best Supporting,0.06789372
but Bette Davis was also at for Best Actress,0.04859347
and so the the general consensus or the the belief is that by having both of them competing for the Best Actress Award kind of cancel each other out and neither of them won which I think it's kind of a travesty cuz,0.24197674
I think Bette Davis her name was all over that Oscar,0.09538801
I think she did an amazing job in this film she's so so good at being you know being angry and spiteful but showing that vulnerability in a few moments,0.31089434
you know you really see the the hearts and the humanity of this woman I really thought the way the film was starting,0.17914654
she would be kind of a cold uncaring character,0.23994353
but there is there is a lot of heart to Margo,0.0632913
and I think that Bette Davis really made that character even better than it could have been if someone else had played it I think and another great kind of little bit trivia that I noted down as well was that her boyfriend in the film bill I think his name was the actor Gary Meryl,0.10430669
I'm not sure if they kind of hooked up while making the film or if they were already together,0.08124085
but you know soon after this,0.064770564
they got married and soon after the film came out All About Eve,0.036247704
Bette Davis implored Joseph L mankiewicz to write a sequel to All About Eve,0.11336505
that would focus on the characters of Margo,0.05171972
and Bill it was built and played by her lover on and off screen,0.20827228
Gary Merrill many years later after she and Meryl had married and divorced Bette Davis ran into mankiewicz at a party and said to him Joe you can forget about that sequel,0.06700744
I played it out and it doesn't which is another fantastic story but you can really see the chemistry between the two Celeste home was very good in the film too I think the only real weak link,0.04844208
in the film is Hugh Malo who plays Lloyd Richards the the the playwright who Rahu's who's written the play that Margo is currently starring in he's okay but he kind of really stands out like a sore thumb,0.1147368
amidst all this amazing acting going on with everyone else around him,0.17643751
so he really does kind of stand out a bit as not being as great,0.24121368
as the other members of the cast great acting fantastic writing are really tightly kind of paced and plotted and edited and and shot story that just keeps you hooked throughout the entire duration,0.14002492
I just was so intrigued to see how Eve Harrington got to that point where she was winning this award,0.057063453
and and I just I loved it I thought was an amazing film is it fun,0.06874284
we should see before you die,0.8552451
it absolutely is how you know criticism of art,0.07755161
but also how this character,0.07954275
but played by George Sanders he he was using his kind of status as a critic of the theater in the wrong ways you know for the wrong reasons and and and looking at something like that,0.07876465
and how people like that do have power in situations in circles like for that because you're looking at these characters in the old they all live in this bubble of the theater,0.10782211
you know you have George Sanders,0.05361694
he's a theater critic,0.22451684
we have the playwright you know we have all these people who act as the actors the assistants,0.0936505
so I liked seeing just that that world even though it doesn't really look at the the actual theater stuff itself,0.078193635
we never really see stuff on stage as far as the actual play is concerned there's a brilliant scene set on this a theatre stage,0.060309164
but it doesn't really delve into the craft of that but more just the people who are involved in it and their lives outside of it you know,0.065158725
but how it's still the theater is looming larger of everything they do it's it's their life,0.07947119
but I like how you know we saw the outside of that and just kind of that the human interactions outside of this performance,0.22094433
and also again as I was saying I love how everything is framed from other people's perspectives and remembrances of Eve,0.04643447
how they came in to how she came into their lives,0.3311267
and how she ultimately got to the place that she is at the beginning and end of the film so I think that's about as much as I can say I hope it's been a right,0.07776631
again I just feel like this film was so great that I just I really needed to do a good job of reviewing it,0.06810755
and maybe I'm just overthinking that it doesn't really matter,0.09058339
but you can tell I love the film obviously and I highly would highly recommend you seeing,0.060566638
I'll watch it on Netflix,0.055906072
so if it's still on Netflix go check it out you can it's a click of a button away,0.13414483
and it's a click you won't regret,0.14116387
