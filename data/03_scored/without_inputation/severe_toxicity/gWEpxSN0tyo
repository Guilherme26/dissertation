good morning in the afternoon everyone i am dorm this is dorm shoes welcome back,0.02135173
to dorm film where we're talking about movies uh today we're gonna be talking about,0.04484668
a night at the opera this movie's from 1935 and boy does it show it,0.038053825
uh so i literally just watched this i finished watching it as i was eating,0.15133992
dinner and came in here to record this immediately after i have a bit of,0.036701508
mixed feelings on this one there there's a lot to like about it there's also,0.03615273
a lot for me personally that just kind of i kind of lost the plot,0.0812728
a little bit so uh this movie is a marx brothers festival i guess because,0.0814983
groucho chico and harpo are all in this i'm a big fan of groucho marx,0.3153077
i was when i was like a teenager anyway just like reading his quotes and,0.04686418
stuff i don't know that i've ever watched a full groucho marx like film i've,0.21119913
definitely watched clips and stuff on youtube but don't know that i've ever actually sat,0.028387377
down to watch a full garage remarks film this film also is on the afi,0.05172734
top 100 list that we were discussing last time with the apartment uh this is,0.007992847
number 85 on that list and to say that it's one of the 100 greatest,0.03661437
films of all time for me personally i don't really get it i really love,0.057788495
groucho marx and i think he is at his most brilliant when it's very dialogue,0.25245354
heavy one of the knocks on this film for me is how little dialogue there,0.03550085
is there are large sort of swaths of movie that are just either songs which,0.029073182
to me weren't very entertaining or just like musical breaks or uh sort of more,0.042724747
like slapstick physical comedy that stuff is great and i don't i don't hate those,0.19909479
kind of things but when i came into it expecting like a big groucho marx,0.3068488
movie and it starts out so great with just groucho marx just doing a lot,0.116697825
of dialogue in the first probably 10-15 minutes i was very optimistic i think as,0.016186578
the movie goes along it gets worse and worse for me by the end i,0.09413679
kept checking to see how long how much time was left and yeah which which,0.036965586
i don't like because i like this sort of older style of movie i like,0.080368154
the silliness and the fact that the movie can just exist to be a a,0.1737147
sort of vehicle for fun little one-liners and zings and zangs one of my biggest,0.07675288
problems with the movie though is that it really doesn't feel like a film rather,0.029461648
than a bunch of little skits sort of stitched together and i know that that's,0.21092442
probably indicative of the mark's style right like a lot of a lot of those,0.044683047
movies i'm assuming the plot just exists for one-liners and that's fine i don't mind,0.027593814
that at all but the plot here is very thin uh there is a love,0.02989801
story going on with with two two two of the characters that i was not,0.015506096
invested in at all and the this that's sort of the through line throughout the,0.018077696
movie is just that relationship that love story and it just wasn't enough to draw,0.040105917
me in um i'm going to contrast this movie with something with a movie that,0.075415194
i really like from the same era bringing up baby from 1938 i also just,0.14171073
watched this year for the first time and that movie does a much better job,0.019948192
in my opinion having a likable love story um having a plot that yes is,0.039168008
funny but and facilitates really good little scenes of humor but is also an interesting,0.03377736
plot and also just is a better through line even if that movie too kind,0.049614053
of loses it a little bit by the end not nearly as much as this,0.081167705
movie does i i am pretty easy to get on board i will i will,0.04896949
give most movies a thumbs up uh and i didn't hate this movie it was,0.04160591
easily watchable there were some movies that or there were some lines rather that i,0.031682696
just i was laugh out loud laughing at from groucho and i just wanted more,0.05023134
of that i wanted more of that zany snappy sort of dialogue that he's known,0.0655758
for and we got a couple of those there's there's a scene where he's alone,0.04808413
in a room at a table and and three other guys have just kind of,0.017377922
left to go hide in the closet as a cop comes and investigates uh the,0.09761171
room and the cops like oh i see you have a table set for four,0.05206991
and groucho goes oh that's nothing i have my alarm set for eight a little,0.03868442
stuff like that i absolutely love there's one of the two of the three sort,0.05058256
of stowaway characters one of which is the love story guy the other two are,0.022758594
chico and harpo are tucked away in his trunk in groucho's trunk he opens the,0.20894416
trunk to see two of them and he's like where are my other clothes and,0.21952923
they say they sold them or whatever and he's like well that's okay i keep,0.05813306
a shirt tucked away in this drawer and he opens the drawer and it's i,0.07443538
think it's harpo it's either chico or harpo he's asleep snoring and groucho goes well,0.112849735
that's not my shirt my shirt doesn't snore i love lines like that i love,0.04663403
little dialogue moments like that and i just wanted more of that from this movie,0.024339736
i think this movie is at its best when groucho is talking uh i don't,0.08560847
really love chico and harpo from this film their best scene to me is sort,0.042291712
of the instrumental back and forth so throughout the course of the movie there are,0.015505431
these song breaks that while i get is just like old hollywood right like a,0.07351942
lot of a lot of old movies are pseudo musicals even if they're not actual,0.07859877
musicals and i get it especially with a movie called a night of the opera,0.07386997
that you have to have some songs the songs suck i i will not find,0.76383966
myself singing any of these songs tomorrow they're they're just they're just not good and,0.083163254
maybe that's because they're an opera song from the 30s right like that is pretty,0.045050893
pretty uh far away pretty detached from what we're used to with music but even,0.041793488
like going back and watching other musicals from that era and stuff there are far,0.021917801
catchier songs than this sort of kind of style going on and it's just to,0.048958182
me it's not captivating to me that was when i was checking my phone and,0.031118622
not really paying attention to the movie i think that afi at least with my,0.051753283
experience so far i've seen about 25 of the movies of the top 100 um,0.01782293
a lot of which are from this sort of golden era i think we can,0.028580945
give those movies a little too much credit like yes i know that they are,0.0498768
trend setting yes i know without them we wouldn't have a lot of the sort,0.037200395
of snappy dialogue comedies later on um i just don't think this is the finest,0.040687952
example of that uh and i i'm looking forward to seeing duck soup which i,0.14806855
know i think is just groucho as opposed to the entire marx family i think,0.14455505
there could be too much marks in a movie so i'm looking forward to seeing,0.073219426
duck soup and seeing how that contrasts with this for me personally i was very,0.066509716
unimpressed with this movie really i liked the first half a lot more than the,0.037910145
second the second is really when they start hammering in the sort of the the,0.06685295
music and the more physical scenes oh i was gonna say so uh there's a,0.05909824
there's a scene where they're singing on a boat and then uh chico and harpo,0.07774201
kind of go back and forth on the piano and harp and it's a fun,0.11031738
scene um especially uh whichever one i think it's harpo the groucho is the easy,0.20995058
one because he has a mustache the other two i get confused uh harpo does,0.2460725
a really fun piano scene where he's sort of entertaining the kids on the ship,0.070051156
and like does a lot of little slapstick stuff like closes the lid of the,0.18602327
piano on his hand and then he pretends like his hand is limp and then,0.22396167
he can only get it when he rocks it back forward and then he goes,0.044766195
limp again like that's it's a really fun little little scene um that that scene,0.10633293
and a couple other scenes in this movie feel a little masturbatory from the marks,0.48889306
like hey we can do this thing really well we can do piano really well,0.036088873
or we can play hard really well or whatever so we have to have that,0.028564315
scene in the movie like plot-wise it made no sense why this random these random,0.055397823
two stowaways or just having an instrument battle for 15 minutes um and i get,0.018359069
that it's like an iconic scene and stuff but at the same time why like,0.033769377
why does it why does it need to be in the movie ultimately i i,0.029592024
do enjoy films of this of this ilk um i i really do like sort,0.054404706
of old hollywood and i like groucho marx and i like some of the lines,0.23111147
in it some of the dialogue was really really funny at the same time as,0.017014068
a movie the plot is almost non-existent um and if the one-liners aren't there to,0.012464211
carry the plot then the movie falls apart and a lot of the movie just,0.02658207
isn't dialogue it's it's physical comedy that again i don't hate but it just doesn't,0.023092516
play super well 80 years removed from it right with that being said uh i'm,0.078717835
giving night at the opera two and a half stars to me three stars is,0.015712302
like an average good recommended movie uh a night the opera for me falls a,0.08120828
little bit short of that i just think it's okay and i think two and,0.20521647
a half stars is about okay um so i'm giving it two and a half,0.018631129
