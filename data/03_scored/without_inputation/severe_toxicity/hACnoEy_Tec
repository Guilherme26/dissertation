a bit of doubt in regards to the cause of this man's death and was,0.085797384
it in fact planned for the sake of collecting the money especially when we take,0.022535756
a look at edward g robinson's character mr keys who happens to be walters boss,0.03894916

the true villain this movie was so interesting i mean it's amazing that this story,0.05624926
is no glamorous then something like a comedy it really isn't anything spectacular but the,0.028368752
way that these characters are portrayed the way that the directing is done the fact,0.012951125
that we have this incredible inner monologue which was then used again by billy wilder,0.06097672
in sunset boulevard in 1950 which would also become one of the most iconic stories,0.024187408
in filmmaking the fact that he just added these little things to his movie to,0.045387477

one of the most incredible character actors and he played edward g robinson in that,0.017021384
film and he was brilliant but to actually see edward g robinson outside of the,0.038696393

fact that i was definitely in for something special does this movie have any negatives,0.022234429
well to a certain degree yes it's not necessarily a movie that is going to,0.018390331
be loved by everybody because especially with me where noir is very hit or miss,0.085816674
like i did not like la confidential but i loved chinatown you know so noir,0.09579576
really does bounce back and forth with me but i had a feeling that i,0.020840868
was gonna like this one but not everybody does like a noir or drama and,0.038655818
it's not a movie that everyone is going to love just because of the nature,0.027180068
of the story some people might just find it boring i mean there's not much,0.032155644
action and noir is very dialogue driven but it does have some very epic moments,0.042457342
that will definitely surprise you but i personally did enjoy this film as a whole,0.06897289
it is a movie that i would love to see again i don't know if,0.056167442
this is a movie that i'm going to own on dvd just because of the,0.039344948
fact that i don't see myself watching it as much as movies like the apartment,0.03035366
and some like it hot but to be frank with you guys i'm sort of,0.25466698
50 50 at this point in time and i wouldn't be surprised if i actually,0.037276227
found it at a good price somewhere online or in target or something like that,0.058760993
i wouldn't be surprised if i actually picked myself up a copy of this film,0.080507845
so i will definitely recommend double indemnity it truly is what it lived up to,0.08604217
be one of the greatest films of all time definitely one that you should check,0.030981593
