don't care about spoilers or if you have seen us and you really just don't,0.027289825
feel like paying to go see it all over again to get all this stuff,0.032123048
sit back relax and let's get into it we start off the movie informing us,0.06630418
that below the United States there are thousands of miles of underground tunnels and routes,0.08238832
that we just simply have no idea about what they are where they lead or,0.04264825
anything like that this sets up the groundwork for the movie to let us know,0.057294264
that something or anything could be happening underground without anyone being the wiser in the,0.040991943
very next scene we see a TV on with the young Adelaide watching we'll just,0.022951497
call her a d4 short for eagle-eyed viewers you might notice that young Adi is,0.084169015
using some scissors to cut up some paper we then see a hands across America,0.1473302
commercial which will play an interesting part later on into this story in the next,0.021369025
scene we're told that it's the year 1986 where young Adi is at a carnival,0.015354434
with her parents on the Santa Cruz Beach at this carnival Adi starts to wander,0.058480952
off and we get our first glimpse of a man holding a sign with the,0.027853236
Bible verse Jeremiah 11 11 don't worry we'll come back and revisit that Adi continues,0.11515593
to wander further away from her parents and goes into a Hall of Mirrors while,0.02062934
inside the power goes out and as she tries to find the exit she bumps,0.044525396
into another little girl that looks exactly like her the film cuts to a room,0.08069609
full of white bunnies locked in their cages don't worry we'll definitely come back to,0.45585638
this - as we fast forward to present day we join Addie now all grown,0.04103119
up with her family driving to their summer home for their vacation her husband Gabe,0.020660603
announces to the family that they will be going to the Santa Cruz Beach to,0.023893397
have some fun as Addie thinks back about the Santa Cruz Beach we start to,0.062339682
see some flashbacks we cut back to the doctor's office with a DS family and,0.06005411
the doctor is suggesting the he might have post-traumatic stress disorder see ever since that,0.02403109
event in the Hall of Mirrors addy hasn't talked at all so the doctor prescribed,0.01648591
to Addie's parents that they should encourage her to do more creative activities like drawing,0.02408896
or dancing with the hope that she'll eventually start talking again despite trying to convince,0.03716115
her husband not to go to Santa Cruz Beach Addie reluctantly agrees to go anyway,0.09504809
Gabe shows off his new boats of the family that he just acquired as the,0.060901552
family drives to the beach they pass an ambulance tending to a dead body turns,0.40298444
out that the same man from 1986 who was holding that Bible verse had passed,0.077815175
away the family meets up with their family friends at the beach and Addie is,0.036641642
still a bit on edge while she's there her younger son Jason goes to the,0.044963088
bathroom on the beach and sees a weird figure standing and looking off into the,0.027646363
distance with bloody hands Addie can't find her son Jason and she starts to panic,0.3947563
after finding Jason her family decides to leave the beach soon after Addie confesses to,0.024003817
her husband about the day in the Hall of Mirrors and little girl in the,0.08779293
mirror that she saw Gabe of course isn't understanding the real issue and brushes it,0.036081556
off that is until Jason lets the family know that there's a strange family outside,0.032528147
on their driveway Gabe goes out to confront them and the strange group just stands,0.024927093
there Addie calls the police but of course we all know that the police in,0.091722175
horror movies well they're pretty much useless most of the time the strange group manages,0.2910455
to break into the residence thanks to a hidden key and begins to hold the,0.021381663
family hostage it's at this point that we all realize that this group are actually,0.080967486
clones of the main family of course these doppelgangers have some differences the leader of,0.088765435
the group who looks exactly like Addie is called red red tells a story about,0.04934199
a girl who had a shadow in the story the girl would eat warm cooked,0.14400893
food while the shadow was forced to eat raw bloody rabbits during Christmas the girl,0.3896547
would get soft cushy toys while the shadow would get sharp coal toys that would,0.07324071
cut her the girl would marry a handsome prince while the shadow was forced to,0.2491854
be with another man mainly because that man was connected to the prince red continues,0.028701345
to recount that when the shadow had to give birth to her the daughter came,0.036805943
out to be a monster and when the second child was born the girl had,0.2047136
a c-section while the shadow had to cut herself in order to give birth to,0.16720322
her son the shadow named her son Pluto and said he was born to love,0.11377301
fire now red is obviously telling a story about herself and Addie with red being,0.06981368
the shadow and Addie being the girl in the story red continues to reiterate her,0.09472481
hatred for Addie and that her resentment has been building up for a long time,0.3268929
red also makes a very interesting confession when she says that there was a day,0.028502453
that she realized that she was being tested by God Gabe interrupts red to ask,0.033764724
just what is it that they want and who are they red replies we're Americans,0.047305867
this is probably the point in the movie where we get the most clear and,0.020591425
obvious social commentary I will absolutely come back to this and this will probably be,0.031869613
the most important theme to understand in the whole movie but let's get back to,0.025995377
the story so chaos ensues as red has Andy handcuffed to the table and the,0.05549627
rest of the family is separated by their doubles we get a moment where something,0.042358894
is revealed to us when we see Pluto and Jason in the closet they appear,0.082590535
to be playing a sort of game and what is shown here is that both,0.009405032
of them are still connected together this will prove to be an important part in,0.022705378
the story later as well anyway so the family continues to fight against their individual,0.08332356
evil copies and after either killing some or evading some of them they eventually reunite,0.48151252
on Gabe's boat they head on over to their family friend's home to find refuge,0.0668177
however to their surprise their friends have already been murdered by their own evil doubles,0.4110344
- addy is captured by the evil friend doubles and held hostage Addie's children come,0.13325691
in and save her by whooping the hell out of those evil doubles as the,0.29209945
family regains control of the house they see on the news that this event seems,0.08393088
to be going on almost on a national level doubles are all dressed in red,0.035909273
with scissors in hand and starting to join hands once the family starts to realize,0.03493611
how dangerous this situation is getting they all decide to just hop in the car,0.032289345
and get out of town unfortunately they forget the actual car keys so Adi goes,0.06865959
back into the house to grab him as she notices one of the evil twins,0.23950799
that she thought she killed that she thought was dead wasn't actually dead because you,0.35729158
know it wouldn't be a horror movie without having someone you thought was dead actually,0.12963432
not be dead so that they can do a nice little jump scare later on,0.23847073
anyway Eddie finds this evil twin and goes ahead and just kills him off as,0.5284119
this is happening her son Jason walks in and notices the gruesome mess that his,0.08649516
mother has left as Adi and her family go to the car to make a,0.123872496
run for it they're met up with their daughters evil twin named hombre after an,0.14323533
interesting game of chicken they throw her off the car and into the woods where,0.26665995
she's impaled and left to die Adi runs out of the car to go check,0.42981783
on her and instead of trying to kill her off it would appear that Adi,0.6430049
has a moment of sympathy as this evil doppelganger starts to die as they travel,0.2640848
back to their home they noticed that Pluto has set their family car on fire,0.1710134
Adi gets out of the car to confront Pluto but Jason realizes that the whole,0.033008408
thing is a trap going back to an earlier point Jason recalls that Pluto and,0.050494757
him are still tethered or connected and uses this connection to make Pluto walk backwards,0.056803357
into the fire and die once again we get another moment where Adi does not,0.37189582
seem necessarily ready to hurry up and kill Pluto but instead she hesitates and has,0.60842556
yet another moment of sympathy for the dying doppelganger unfortunately there seem to be another,0.06833698
layer to this trap because Redd was waiting and took Jason down into the underground,0.110458404
area where all the clones were from Adi goes solo on this mission deep down,0.055008028
into the bowels of this underground area Jordan Peele gets some nice credit here for,0.046439797
setting up the atmosphere with this hellish setting it's kind of reminiscent of a sort,0.10202986
of dissension into Dante's hell mixed in with some Freddy Krueger boiler room scenes -,0.20726657
Adi reaches the classroom where red is cutting up paper into figures that are holding,0.07865132
hands during this confrontation and standoff Redd finally gives us a whole lot of details,0.04612317
and clues as to everything that's been going on so let's break some of it,0.040270217
down red tells Adi that all of the clones down there or the tethered were,0.08233244
just as human as the people above she continues by saying that humans built this,0.0723773
place and that she believes that the humans figured out how to copy the body,0.09571926
but not the soul furthermore she believed that it is the soul that is shared,0.049902078
by the two bodies which is why the clones are tethered to the people above,0.03259001
read then continues to say that the humans that created the tethered were trying to,0.030631041
control the people above so in a way I guess we could kind of think,0.07157043
of the tethered people as kind of like human voodoo dolls now this idea of,0.22000417
having people controlled from below goes back to a one-liner from a Dee's daughter Zora,0.1250073
earlier in the movie she casually mentions that she had heard that the government has,0.020178346
been putting fluoride in the water and using that as a means to control people's,0.012338491
minds while the government involvement is not actually confirmed in the movie it's the best,0.013305669
that we can go off of right now but anyway let's get back to the,0.036974233
story red continues on to say that the humans who created the tethered failed in,0.06541482
their goal to create human puppets and they abandoned them with no direction the tethered,0.16445601
went crazy red says that both her and Adi were born special and this is,0.17615925
the part of the movie where we start to see the camera go back and,0.044085044
forth from the above world and to the below tunnels with all the tethered people,0.14234199
mimicking the actions of those above red tells Adi that she believes that God brought,0.068001725
them together that faithful night when they walked into the Hall of Mirrors red confesses,0.027795363
to Adi how she's never stopped thinking about Adi and how Adi could have taken,0.06822323
red with her to the above world after a couple of years red tells Adi,0.06599952
that a miracle happened when Addie was learning how to dance in the world above,0.039692175
since they were both tethered together red also began to learn how to dance down,0.06797312
below and took that as being a miracle from God the other tethered people saw,0.059818637
that red was very different and viewed red as their new leader and Savior so,0.02546855
red planned for years and years after so much obsessing not only to kill Adi,0.450466
but as she said she also wanted to make a statement to the entire world,0.021688977
red wanted to lead a revolution and she was gonna use the Hands Across America,0.11460183
ideal as the basis at this point both red and addy start fighting each other,0.05389584
with red using the precision and agility that she learned from Addie's dancing in order,0.032199543
to stab her repeatedly of course like any classic villain red gets a little bit,0.6627998
too overconfident toying with her prey and Addie is able to stab her and choke,0.64305955
her to death Addie finds her son Jason hiding in a locker and they all,0.30405527
get into an ambulance to drive to safety as the family is driving away in,0.107403874
the ambulance we finally have the truth and the big twist of the movie revealed,0.027473414
turns out that when Addie went into the Hall of Mirrors and saw that evil,0.12084125
twin the twin choked out Addie crushing her throat the evil twin dragged Daddy into,0.6482491
the tunnel and handcuffed her down there and escaped the underground to become the new,0.09048693
Addie so we basically had a major switcheroo happen where red has been the real,0.030676939
Adelaide all along and the Addie that we've come to know has been the tethered,0.02995455
clone living in the above world so now we know the real reason why as,0.10454625
a little girl that tethered Addie wasn't able to talk because none of the tethered,0.12498601
were able to talk however this tethered version of Addie was able to learn how,0.052069247
to talk only after being exposed to all the creative activities like drawing and dancing,0.016062854
in order to express herself we also know that the reason why red was talking,0.037652057
so strangely was because of the strangulation during the encounter with the tethered Addie as,0.030988246
the family dries off into the country Jason takes a long look at his mother,0.1111901
and she looks back at him with a faint smile and he puts his mask,0.12296186
right back on we conclude the movie with the camera expanding out showing the large,0.054489184
number of doppelgangers who have now replicated the Hands Across America emblem and have joined,0.07003652
hands across a large stretch of land well that was us and yeah that was,0.015785472
a lot that just happened right especially with the twist but there's one thing that,0.017743774
I think is pretty important with this movie and that is to understand the themes,0.03534786
that are going on and to understand the themes that are at work here I,0.02613174
do think that you're gonna be able to look at this movie in a whole,0.03510839
different way and just make a little bit more sense of it so to get,0.035380453
an idea of those themes let's just start off with Jordan peels own words this,0.04564623
movie is about this country we're in a time where we fear the other whether,0.05660114
it's the mysterious invader that we think is going to come and kill us and,0.6806133
take our jobs or the faction we don't live near who voted a different way,0.03745516
than us we're all about pointing the finger and I wanted to suggest that maybe,0.025315559
the monster we really need to look at has our face maybe the evil it's,0.18847913
us I think one of the most important things to do when you're going in,0.024350377
to watch the movie us is to kind of get a sense of like what,0.0422365
the themes are doing so one of the major themes that Jordan Peele is talking,0.01264115
about is the fear of the other and that's a very interesting fear that a,0.034095317
lot of us can have and it can range from a number of different things,0.017828252
whether it's miss 'ti politics immigration whatever people sometimes can fear what is other than,0.032794885
themselves and another working theme that is at play here is the concept of privilege,0.012040489
now one thing I do want to make clear is the idea that privilege is,0.020998517
not always a monetary or a financial type of thing I mean that can play,0.011060009
a part of it but privilege is always in the sense of being in relation,0.021039758
to another when you understand those themes and the intention that Pele was going for,0.009388402
you can see how they played out in the movie so let's look at some,0.037106603
examples of how privilege and the fear of the other are played out in the,0.023040632
film so in the movie the relation of privilege is between the people above ground,0.062728815
and the tethered people below red made that clear when she listed off those things,0.07252231
that she suffered from like having to eat raw rabbits not being able to choose,0.10738326
the person she loves to even having to deliver her own child red essentially demonstrates,0.04728591
that Adi enjoyed a lot of things in life in a much more comfortable and,0.033526585
privileged way the interesting thing about that scene was that we got our most obvious,0.034301527
social commentary during the scene where Abe asked who are you people and red answered,0.036990196
we're Americans I believe that Pele is using this dynamic to straight how some Americans,0.04738968
can live a privileged life and completely ignore or be ignorant to our fellow Americans,0.26259074
who are also suffering right under our noses what I like about this duality and,0.13831961
the themes is that it can be applicable to a number of different social issues,0.017085908
the quote unquote other and the fear of the other can be applicable to race,0.12368225
class wealth or even immigration we have American citizens that are literally afraid of other,0.10780831
American immigrants coming into this country trying to replace us you have people in this,0.15861171
country who have some of the best health care while other Americans can't afford it,0.041204803
or dying from the lack of it remember that scene were aid to Gabe's glasses,0.0387536
Gabe has had the privilege of having health care you know to go get glasses,0.038451605
and to be able to see clearly while Abe has never even experienced that he's,0.03823875
probably gone a lot of his tethered life walking around with blurry vision you also,0.17908806
have other instances of privilege when it comes to racial tensions when one ethnicity gets,0.069173776
disproportionately targeted and the other turns a blind eye all these situations if not more,0.10503981
are being echoed through the theme of other nests and the fear of it but,0.02278254
let's talk about that twist ending because I'll be honest I actually thought that the,0.023915347
twist ending was kind of unnecessary at first until I started to understand the themes,0.091003776
and apply them to what the movie was trying to convey I believe by having,0.049200308
addy and red switched places it proves something interesting for both the story and the,0.0229056
social commentary peel was getting at for the sake of the story read and formed,0.011396592
us that she believed that the humans who created the tethered could not replicate a,0.06544276
soul for them so instead they had to share one soul with two bodies well,0.045899667
it would appear that Addie's life in the above world proved that the tethered could,0.035081785
possibly live fully functional lives if they were given the actual opportunity access and the,0.017848874
resources we were led to believe that because the tether couldn't talk that they were,0.034044765
indeed soulless well I think Addie disproved that notion seeing as though she is a,0.10575821
tethered clone I think the same applies with the social message that Peale was trying,0.039994165
to come if we look at this from a class perspective let's pretend that Adi,0.035641205
was originally poor but then let's say she traded places with like a rich twin,0.05067502
from above well a deal earned how to dance find love have a family and,0.020896744
friends and lead a very productive life so I think what Pele is trying to,0.020204954
show with the twist in this movie is that if the people that we think,0.033062954
are others were given the same opportunities and privileges as the people above maybe those,0.031466514
others could also gain a soul of their own now it doesn't end there if,0.029550118
we stay focused on the twist ending let's also look at the other side of,0.023246173
that with Adi - Adi not only is one of the tethered people but she,0.06517203
sure as hell wasn't going to go back to that status either she was willing,0.21638623
not only to fight but to become a monster herself in order to protect the,0.23057742
privilege that she had already taken that goes back to peels commentary about how we,0.035239436
can become the very monsters we think we're fearing that monster could very well have,0.10724623
our same face or we could become the monsters - okay so now let me,0.13184406
just go over five of the most prevailing questions I've seen online and don't get,0.025019553
me wrong there are a lot of other questions that I can go over but,0.02319828
this video would be going on forever so I'm just gonna go over my top,0.061345898
five questions that I've seen out there and I'll give you my take on them,0.03645273
so let's get to it so let's get started with what was the deal with,0.025111347
the Bible verse Jeremiah 11:11 well the Bible verse goes as follows therefore thus saith,0.07158972
the Lord behold I will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able,0.4609041
to escape and though they shall cry on to me I will not hearken on,0.04514801
to them I believe that in the movie when read talks about miracles and signs,0.028963426
from God she essentially became kind of like a nat turner type of figure from,0.040578198
birth of a nation and what I mean by that is she essentially became like,0.04820586
a spiritual leader who wanted to lead a revolution that she believed was assigned to,0.049907397
her by God so in the case of Jeremiah 11:11 I believe that read just,0.03667756
saw herself as kind of like a vehicle of God's wrath upon the people that,0.19838038
she blamed for all of her suffer another interesting question is who exactly is behind,0.1317343
all of this well the movie does not explicitly say who did all of it,0.042889047
but that's more than likely an intentional move by Jordan Peele he stated in a,0.025547042
number of interviews that he wanted to keep things ambiguous so audiences can basically just,0.020073246
make up their own minds however the leading thought out there is that the perpetrator,0.05854747
in this film is actually the government or maybe some secret society or whatever read,0.025979413
says that humans were the ones that created the tethered and abandoned them for generations,0.057445925
we also got that line from zoara's saying that the government is controlling people with,0.028643472
fluoride in the water I believe that this is another bit of social commentary from,0.011868872
Pele I think what we can draw from this is that the real enemy in,0.04538947
the movie are the humans or the government that abandoned the tethered people it's almost,0.04440101
like if a government left their people with no clean water or something now as,0.09265875
a result of ditching the tethered they were left with no direction or purpose and,0.038037196
according to read they went crazy because of that the messed up thing here is,0.0696241
that the tethered people decided to focus their attention on their counterparts or fellow Americans,0.024833301
rather than trying to focus their attention on the humans that created them and left,0.051340204
them there to suffer so it could be that Pele is saying that we mean,0.08428077
to start shifting our attention to those people that are in power rather than fighting,0.042211223
one another because at the end of the day we're all connected ok another interesting,0.023962576
question was what's the deal with the rabbits now this is just my own theory,0.02052025
but I do think that the rabbits just might have started out as test subjects,0.033384237
for the cloning process that was going on down there of course since the tethered,0.027857225
were left to fend for themselves I think they released the rabbits allowing them to,0.027321752
reproduce and thus becoming a steady food source for the tethered people to eat there's,0.046239577
also the possibility that the rabbits were symbolic of the white rabbit from Alice in,0.0009119711
Wonderland you know seeing as though Addie kept traveling further and further down the tunnels,0.07772671
with a bunch of rabbits all along the way by the way a fun Easter,0.17774971
egg was that the daughters aura was wearing a rabbit on her shirt and when,0.09867267
she wore the shirt that said though that actually is Vietnamese the word rabbit and,0.072779074
another obvious question is what was the deal with the Hands Across America stuff well,0.043083943
don't feel bad like unless you grew up in the 80s you probably just never,0.039546497
heard of the Hands Across America but it was a big deal in the mid,0.037974004
80s it was a huge charitable event that involved a lot of celebrities and musicians,0.023448389
and big businesses that had a goal of trying to fight world hunger and homelessness,0.0539424
only problem is that it was a logistical nightmare I wouldn't say it's exactly the,0.019402742
same thing but I guess some people could say that it was kind of like,0.01198661
the fire festival of the 80s in one of the first scenes of the movie,0.028023522
we see the commercial for Hands Across America which a young red is actually watching,0.029852778
at a very young age before she gets captured and tossed into the tethered underground,0.08023445
so because this was like the last thing that red had really seen as a,0.03968286
child it's kind of understandable that this would make a big impression on her that,0.14813107
impression lasted even longer as red was left with the Hands Across America t-shirt and,0.05571578
she obsessed over it and Adi for years and years recalled that red said that,0.06604874
killing Adi wasn't enough and that sending a message to the world was also part,0.65537494
of the plan so red was only left with all that she knew and the,0.032474265
biggest most impactful plan that she can think of was the Hands Across America campaign,0.047876593
and of course seeing as though that the tethered people saw red as being very,0.07522562
special and unique and in a sense she's also kind of like their spiritual leader,0.065284446
they followed Reds plan to mimic the Hands Across America campaign in order to basically,0.08138588
give out a big statement to the world that would appear to be kind of,0.05221492
like a revolutionary statement okay so what's the deal with Jason so there's a lot,0.1254869
of questions that revolve around Jason's character some people are throwing out some wild theories,0.026010675
about him being switched with Pluto and whether he was a tethered person all this,0.101037405
time and all this other stuff and so on and so forth well let me,0.027159449
try and clarify this with my own opinion and some facts from the movie first,0.018478801
off given the big reveal with a DS character being a tethered person all this,0.07877903
time I think we have to understand the implications of what that means for her,0.031451214
family in the living room red said that she gave birth to Pluto and that,0.095997974
he had a love for fire so right off the bat we can eliminate the,0.22522213
notion that Pluto and Jason had been switched because red had clearly raised Pluto up,0.056182742
until this time that also means that Jason is a tease biological son too and,0.06683699
since the twist revealed that Addie is a tethered clone that means that Jason and,0.031470504
his sister Zora are in a sense biracial Jason is a byproduct of a tethered,0.103295036
clone mating with a normal person so this would actually explain why Jason seemed so,0.34886897
weird it would also account for why Addie felt the need to try and teach,0.051710047
Jason how to snap on beat during the I got five on it's song as,0.10300635
some people have noticed even Addie was offbeat herself when she was trying to teach,0.055180307
him how to get in rhythm but just think why would anyone teach their kid,0.05620735
rhythm unless they were born without a soul so now we can kind of go,0.13807683
back and look at that final shot of Jason looking at his mother and deciding,0.13030615
to put on his mask I thought it was a really interesting moment because throughout,0.050192762
the movie jason has always been wearing a mask and it's not like it's Halloween,0.045916963
or anything but even more specifically Jason's mask was that of a monster so when,0.08901621
jason has witnessed his mother doing some really gruesome things I think that Jason choosing,0.17564906
to put on a monster mask symbolizes how we function in society in a way,0.20460384
we may literally see the horrors and the ugly truth in society other people or,0.2879463
even in our friends and family but rather than confronting those issues we tend to,0.028320858
put on our monster mask and continue about our day this might signify the notion,0.20274797
that Jason knows just how much of a monster his mother can be but he's,0.37516072
willing to put a figurative and literal mask on to continue living life just as,0.12278891
usual and ignore that ugly truth well those are my thoughts on the movie us,0.24723269
along with my breakdown and analysis and I know that there are a ton of,0.036312375
questions and Easter eggs and way more theories that could be made about this movie,0.05725901
and there's absolutely no way I even have the amount of time to cover every,0.037142523
single one of them but I would love for you all to mention your thoughts,0.074305005
