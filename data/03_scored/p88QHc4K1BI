hey everyone it's Alexander the real mr. Robinson welcome to my channel and this is,0.06759186
my review for singing in the rain which is another first-time viewing experience considering that,0.03875786
there's nothing happening out there right now so this is a movie about Hollywood pretty,0.09148141
much and more specifically it takes place during the era of Hollywood where silent movies,0.07131484
are starting to transition into sound our main character is Donald Lockwood played by Gene,0.08201219
Kelly and he is the lead in a film that's being made as a silent,0.13230988
film but during this transitional period because of that scene in the jazz singer the,0.050209034
production shuts down and the movie has to be retooled to be a talking picture,0.16107677
and the movie pretty much follows lockwood his vaudeville partner and best friend played by,0.05259157
Donald O'Connor and a young up-and-coming actress played by Debbie Reynolds as they try to,0.1421179
work to save the movie and retool it to be a talking film so in,0.08563083
the same way I talked about Casablanca yesterday singing in the rain is another movie,0.067685544
that I have never seen up until now but it's such an iconic movie that,0.07259191
I can recognize a reference to singing in the rain when I see it more,0.050311293
specifically the famous scene where Gene Kelly is dancing to singing in the rain because,0.053029597
there was actually a lot about this movie that to be honest I didn't expect,0.062199622
for one thing I didn't expect this movie to take place in the time period,0.076993726
that it takes place this movie came out in 1952 and I assumed that it,0.1021806
would be a movie set in the 50s but I was surprised to find out,0.051360495
that it was actually set in the 20s during the silent film era and that,0.02468321
it was truly about Hollywood because I literally had no idea of what the plot,0.09383803
to this movie was which to be honest is actually one of my disappointments with,0.124197565
the movie and it's not really with the movie itself it's just more like the,0.0604676
circumstances of when I saw this movie because again this is the first time I've,0.0800226
ever seen singing in the rain with no prior knowledge of it outside of the,0.06323707
cast and the iconic dancing scene but when I was watching this movie and watching,0.07161251
the plot go along and unfolded I thought to myself this is the artist this,0.08068452
is the plot of the artist where it takes place in the silent era of,0.075821474
film and it's during that transitional period where silent movies are actually starting to die,0.31089434
out in favor of talking pictures and again this is not a fair criticism towards,0.09834712
singing in the rain because singing in the rain came first 59 years to be,0.038642645
exact but because I saw the artist first the plot to sing in the rain,0.050331004
just didn't really leave me with many surprises and to be honest I thought the,0.05852232
artist was actually a lot more compelling in terms of its characters but again that's,0.060636103
not a fair criticism towards singing in the rain at all because it technically was,0.06693787
the first movie that came out and by comparing the two movies you could clearly,0.10320532
tell that singing in the rain was a big influence in the making of the,0.0647148
artist right down to the fact that Gene Kelly and John Dujardin look identical in,0.08280741
fact a lot of times when I was watching singing in the rain I kept,0.052567065
expecting a French accent to come out of Gene Kelly because he looked so much,0.16241132
like Jean Dujardin or more accurately Jean Dujardin looked a lot like Gene Kelly and,0.06862328
I have some other problems with the movie that I think are legit criticisms but,0.077953674
I don't want to talk about those quite yet because this movie is really good,0.14874956
this is a lot of fun and when people say that this is one of,0.07193815
the greatest if not the greatest dance movie out there I could definitely believe that,0.10009127
and it all has to come down to your main three actors especially Gene Kelly,0.17055361
Gene Kelly dancing in this movie is the stuff of legends he has energy in,0.10151677
him he is able to take whatever's around him whether it's certain parts of the,0.06661857
set or certain props and use those to his advantage to enhance the dancing and,0.10020623
it is just this sounds corny but it's magical to watch him dance and dancing,0.32235518
a way to where it looks like he's never tired you just have to wonder,0.20858683
how many takes did he and the others have to do in order to get,0.085223734
those dancing sequences right because that's got to be exhausting Donald O'Connor is really good,0.118684985
in the movie and he manages to keep up with Gene Kelly in terms of,0.06776724
dancing but honestly in terms of a character Donald O'Connor just didn't really leave that,0.08222593
much of an impression on me unlike Debbie Reynolds who is very good in this,0.14903724
movie as well and she also manages to stay toe to toe with Gene Kelly,0.09451289
in terms of the performances and I think she's might be my second favorite character,0.063104354
in the movie another fantastic actress in this movie is Jean Hagen as Donald Lockwood's,0.19065969
co-star in the movie that they're making and this is one of those characters where,0.038140267
I can't stand her because her voice in the movie is the equivalent of Quint,0.338419
scratching on a chalkboard and you just can't stand this woman she is irritating she's,0.656869
obnoxious and yet she is very very funny and one of the big plot points,0.54440683
in this movie is that she has such an obnoxious voice a voice that is,0.65892065
not made for talking pictures that Debbie Reynolds character actually had to dub her over,0.15570344
because the test audiences were laughing at her natural voice and what's really interesting and,0.08053787
ironic about that is that the sequences where Debbie Reynolds is dubbing over Jean Hagen's,0.13523519
character is actually Hagen's natural voice so that's pretty impressive and I just recently found,0.14989236
out before doing this review that gene Hagen was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at,0.12392325
the Oscars and yeah with the situation like that that's a nomination well deserved now,0.095730394
I did mention earlier that I had some other issues with this movie which is,0.061640393
why I'm not gonna give it my highest rating get off your ass and go,0.9592038
see it right now and this criticism is honestly another one that I can't really,0.06144824
blame the movie for because with this criticism you got taken to context the time,0.15118477
that this movie was made and that's the first time that Gene Kelly and Debbie,0.084989995
Reynolds are on screen Gene Kelly is running from a bunch of really crazy fans,0.63102484
he jumps on one of the trolleys and jumps into the passenger seat of Debbie,0.10266344
Reynolds car and she's freaking out naturally you got some weird random stranger jumping into,0.37949875
her car perfectly but then when she finds out that he's a famous actor she's,0.18725166
calm she's relaxed and there are several points during this first meeting where Gene Kelly,0.056241043
has his around her and he's getting really close to her and I'm just like,0.08313131
oh no not good not good that is you just met this woman stay back,0.36139914
man too too soon and again this is something I really can't blame the movie,0.10413638
for it's just the fact that I first watched this movie in a post me,0.076125324
too era and it just felt a little creepy watching it in the era that,0.15140574
we're in right now and then there's also one dancing sequence in this movie that,0.054686334
I felt was totally unnecessary it's a sequence where Gene Kelly is describing to the,0.08071102
studio head the one final scene that they need to make for the movie and,0.082532525
it's told to this giant what-if scenario and again it's an amazing dance sequence but,0.06568763
I felt like it wasn't natural to the plot and it was just put in,0.08936318
there for filler but outside of that there is absolutely no denying that this is,0.11072053
a great film it's an incredible dance movie the entire singing in the rain sequence,0.070569254
is iconic the performances are fantastic it's a lot of fun to watch it's funny,0.102962464
even though I'm not gonna give it my highest rating it's still a movie that,0.07553352
if you love classic film it's worth seeing in her lifetime it's not my favorite,0.2035246
musical out there I still love movies like West Side Story or Sound of Music,0.035525307
a lot more than I do singing in the rain but there is absolutely no,0.053780362
denying that this movie is fantastic and iconic in its own ways and there you,0.11066201
go that's my review for singing in the rain and much like with Casablanca this,0.07953438
is another movie that Turner Classic Movies is showing on their classic film festival special,0.1088971
home edition so if you want to see this movie for the first time or,0.07962982
again you've got no better chance then later today so now I want to know,0.14884384
what you guys think about this movie if you've seen it what did you think,0.08613719
do you think my criticisms of the movie are invalid or unfair whatever the case,0.07580244
