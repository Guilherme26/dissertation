hello hello hello and welcome to another video and happy new year let's hope that,0.031194452
2021 is better than 2020 was today i'm going to be reviewing the costumes in,0.044128284
the film portrait of a lady on fire which is one of my favorite films,0.101179086
it's set in france in the 18th century so i feel like it's kind of,0.06246407
my wheelhouse and i've always wanted to do a costume review film like or costume,0.04145358
review video talking about the accuracy of the costumes and one of my favorite movies,0.054954812
so i think this is a good pick portrait of a lady on fire follows,0.14486901
two main characters heloise and marianne heloise's mother has hired marianne a painter to pretend,0.033830576
to be heloise's companion and paint her in secret because heloise has previously refused to,0.035058506
sit for a portrait artist and as they hang out together the two of them,0.13342386
fall in love the film also follows the also follows the storyline of the young,0.012809441
maid sophie but those are the three characters who are important to the film and,0.01429014
that's really all you need to know to understand the costumes of the film when,0.022397399
critiquing the costumes of this film i'm not going to be critiquing them from a,0.11399119
creative standpoint i'm not really an expert in costume design and the people who designed,0.03636426
these costumes are i'm mostly looking at this from an accuracy perspective what is accurate,0.060338143
what isn't and just to learn more about dress history so i guess without further,0.025584294
ado let's get to the costumes overall the costumes in this film are pretty good,0.05287079
first looking at the silhouettes first the silhouettes are pretty accurate to the mid-18th century,0.01537572
i think this film is supposed to be set in 1760 and all of the,0.042378183
characters have 1760s skirt shapes and bodice shapes one of the characters heloise i feel,0.065367594
like she could be wearing more um skirt supports or panties which widen the skirt,0.25607005
horizontally but i understand that maybe the reasoning behind that is that she's kind of,0.063163176
living in a rural area and she's just come from a convent so maybe she's,0.073945805
not wearing the most fashionable skirt supports but you can tell that all the characters,0.03842367
are wearing stays and you actually get to see the stays in several clips and,0.010720765
the stays that the characters are wearing look like historical stays they look like they,0.011797032
could be examples from museums there is one issue where the stays cross lace like,0.013571742
your tennis shoes might lace rather than doing spiral lacing which is almost like a,0.03806181
ladder and 18th century stays spiral laced but other than that the stays are super,0.026409121
accurate looking additionally the characters are all wearing shifts under their stays and the shift,0.017445771
is like a very basic t-shaped garment that people wore under their stays in the,0.043771744
18th century and it kind of absorbs sweat keeps your stays clean just keeps everything,0.033639003
nice and you can wash your shift much more easily than you could wash a,0.062929034
pair of stays and the characters are wearing shifts that look very similar to the,0.0072764438
shifts that were worn in the mid-18th century and a lot of times historical films,0.017924704
forget to add shifts underneath corsets and stays which is just like that's really uncomfortable,0.054015573
i feel bad for the actresses who have to deal with that because it's super,0.059351675
uncomfortable to wear a pair of stays or a corset without something underneath to prevent,0.10332431
rubbing against your skin additionally the characters are all wearing petticoats and the pity coats,0.10589857
close at the sides which is how 18th century petticoats closed so that was pretty,0.047381032
good to see as well additionally several of the garments that are worn in this,0.01819876
film were inspired by museum examples that i can clearly identify the most the most,0.024832636
clear example of this is the cloak that eloise wears throughout the movie it is,0.02075506
like a cotton cloak and it's quilted and you can you can sometimes see like,0.08190007
the lining of her hood which has a different printed cotton lining and there is,0.046899438
a very similar cloak from the kyoto fashion institute which is i think a little,0.02555569
bit later in date it's from like the 1780s whereas this film is set in,0.064936556
the 1760s but other than that they're very similar in cut and construction and even,0.032770272
the trimming on the original coat and the coat in the film is really similar,0.021887869
so i thought that was an interesting uh call back to like the real historical,0.027215324
garments the character sophie the maid she's also dressed it looks very similar to the,0.043480393
portrait um the chocolate girl by jean etienne leotard i think that's his name and,0.28919935
she's wearing a cap and a little pinner apron and a little jacket and a,0.044255998
petticoat and it just looks pretty similar to that painting i also found a painting,0.02580314
from 1764 and it's an english painting but um she the one of the people,0.027210003
in that painting is wearing something very similar to what sophie is wearing in the,0.018731572
film so you can see that the costume designers were looking at images of maids,0.031337466
and female servants when they decided what sophie should wear lastly eloise's green dress which,0.08326769
is what she's painted in in the film is really reminiscent of several 18th century,0.020637987
green dresses that i can think of the most notably being one from the metropolitan,0.05192623
museum of art which is dated a little bit later than this film is set,0.040717885
but the color is very similar and there's one scene where sophie the maid is,0.0312623
carrying the dress and the dress definitely has more structure than most 18th century dresses,0.02743683
did despite like how structured they look on the body 18th century dresses themselves usually,0.044082385
don't have a lot of structure they might have a little bit of reed or,0.032768276
whale bone in them but not very much whereas when sophie's carrying it it looks,0.09919152
like the dress is like made partially of cardboard which is a little bit weird,0.21694499
but other than that the dress that dress specifically it looks like it could be,0.04168839
from the period this the seaming is correct the watto pleats which are the pleats,0.024576541
on the back of a sack backgown they look like original examples and even the,0.084326
the sleeve seams um the sleeve seams are along the back of the arm which,0.03377337
is how a lot of 18th century sleeves were constructed another good thing that i,0.014197014
noticed about the costumes is that louise and marianne and sophie are all wearing neck,0.07574513
tuckers or little ruffles around their neckline as well as ruffles around the cuffs of,0.15429267
their dresses or jackets this is this was really common in the 18th century and,0.044912536
oftentimes in historical dramas they end up omitting this stylistic detail and it always ends,0.07247508
up looking a little bit off despite all of these great aspects of the film,0.046324056
of the costumes of the film there are a few things that are a little,0.015596561
bit off sad i'm sad to say for one looking at this film i would,0.19163409
have thought that it was set in maybe 1770 rather than 1760 or even 1775,0.026901357
because several of the characters namely heloise and her mother have closed front dresses and,0.10272364
i'm not 100 sure about jackets in the 1760s they might have had closed fronts,0.04324492
but most dresses in the 1760s had open fronts meaning that the front of the,0.030284481
dress there was kind of like a line here of what's called robin's and you,0.021961039
have a stomacher which is like basically a triangular piece of fabric that you can,0.045573726
switch out and heloise is casual dress as well as heloise's mother's jacket both of,0.05040762
them closed just straight down the front which is something you don't really see until,0.17637478
1775 but then again that's kind of pedantic and i think the the costume designers,0.18081355
were probably going for just an 18th century or mid to late 18th century look,0.020862155
rather than something very specifically 1760 but that was something that jumped out at me,0.04916439
when i was watching one aspect of the costuming of this film that really jumped,0.045324948
out at me as incorrect was the fact that heloise and marianne aren't wearing caps,0.028209774
sophie the maid is and so i imagine that the costume designers might have been,0.04543537
trying to use caps as code for domestic servant because there is one scene where,0.019181902
you see some of the people from the nearby village and a lot of them,0.041860674
are wearing caps so maybe more than domestic servant maybe caps is kind of code,0.017762398
for like working class characters but that wasn't really how it worked in the 18th,0.015571949
century pretty much everyone wore caps except on special occasions and like if you're going,0.05762752
to a ball or something caps weren't so much a thing for modesty as they,0.033310402
were for uh like keeping your hair clean and sometimes caps could even be born,0.1019813
to demonstrate like your wealth because fancier caps demonstrate that you are you can afford,0.027772082
a fancier cap and therefore you're a wealthier member of society and so it's just,0.12817623
a little bit jarring to see sophie and louise not wearing caps another thing that,0.03466139
was kind of odd was the fact that throughout the film their hair is just,0.0159378
in low buns which makes sense because which makes sense in some way because that's,0.09538201
kind of how you would wear your hair under a basic cap like if you're,0.057940155
if you're just putting on a basic cap to keep your hair clean you're not,0.10641342
going to do a fancy hairstyle but because neither of them are wearing caps you,0.061006654
might expect them to have a fancier hairstyle to show off but their hair is,0.036547184
just in buns and this is less jarring in the 1760s when the hairstyles were,0.09118404
not so high but there's a scene set a little bit later i think in,0.104230285
the 1780s and heloise still has the exact same bun in her hair and it's,0.09445142
just a little bit odd because like she's at the opera or no she's at,0.08729604
the orchestra and her hair is just in a little bun at the back of,0.12404078
her head which is not how it would have been worn she probably should have,0.060163867
had taller hair or some sort of hedgehog hair or something taller the last thing,0.09297937
that i thought was really weird about the costumes were the like sheer bits of,0.092398666
cloth that heloise and marianne wore around their faces when they went to the beach,0.046935357
when it was windy i looked this up and i thought oh maybe it's like,0.03827334
a coastal french fashion from the 18th century but according to an article i read,0.035744973
that was interviewing the costume designer this was actually a modern choice just to lend,0.019830454
like eroticism to the film with like the covered mouths and then it was on,0.054100715
the beach that the the two characters eventually kiss and so having the like thin,0.03172527
fabric covering their mouths is supposed to kind of lend to the suspense of that,0.056643046
scene which i guess makes sense but it was it was a little bit jarring,0.069042735
historically it didn't really make sense in the context of the 18th century another thing,0.013779279
about those masks that i thought was funny just in the context of 2020 and,0.028357444
i guess now 2021 is marianne's mask is below her nose and i saw that,0.17719494
and i was like oh no marianne you're not you're not wearing your covet mask,0.13131656
properly it's got to cover your nose and your mouth and then i realized that,0.53608614
this is set in 1760 and coven 19 masks are not a thing but that's,0.031927485
that's definitely my modern take on this one last thing that i thought was really,0.023260808
funny is i found a quote from one of the costume designers about 18th century,0.01847481
stays and i think from watching historical films those of us who like watching historical,0.080736
films for their costumes we're all kind of used to the stays and corsets are,0.053781427
bad for you joe so this quote was just really funny in that context the,0.07684135
designer said during that era women's bodies were confined to clothing stiffened with whale bone,0.24067152
which greatly restricted their movements including breathing which is really funny because there are shots,0.09219977
of the characters running there are shots of one of the characters marianne lifting a,0.021160157
heavy box and you can see like she's moving her arms like she's lifting a,0.055862788
big box she's she's bending over like the 18th century stays that the characters are,0.03346007
wearing aren't restricting their movements so i don't understand why the designer thought that maybe,0.0201391
the actresses didn't like wearing stays and stays there's it feels different than wearing like,0.016826486
a modern bra but they're not restrictive i've worn stays all day at events and,0.036986873
it's no different than wearing a bra in terms of like how restricted you feel,0.043437824
it's just a little bit different so i thought that was pretty funny stays are,0.048604302
not torture devices everyone psa overall as a viewer this film is also just something,0.023990514
that i really enjoy it's good to see the stories of queer women in the,0.18763168
past being told queer people existed and have existed throughout history i can think of,0.04058485
like the ladies of langolin as another example of queer women in this period and,0.039379537
so that's really cool and then the film is just entertaining and beautiful to watch,0.03476316
and it's just a good film i really enjoyed it so if you want to,0.038150944
distract yourself and spend a little bit of time bringing in the new year with,0.046437137
a good film i highly recommend portrait of a lady on fire we'll be back,0.19119573
in the next couple weeks with another with more sewing content and so i hope,0.040767774
until then have a good day have a good week thank you to you for,0.02030207
watching thank you to ali for their help filming and editing this video and i,0.10402341
hope that you have a happy new year hello hello hello and happy new year,0.028888926
