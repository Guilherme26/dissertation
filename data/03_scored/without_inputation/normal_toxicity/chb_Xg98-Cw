i love romantic comedies,0.13898213
it's actually quite sad,0.080186404
i will watch any sort of romantic comedy film book,0.17068602
i'll read tv show i have to have a couple to ship to keep me interested in a tv show it's i've been this way since i was a teenager and i'm 25,0.07246105
now i don't see myself changing um,0.091925524
so of course i have to talk about one of the first ever ever romantic comedies to grace to hollywood screens and that is the 1934 classic film it happened one night starring clark gable claudette colbert and frank capra let's get into it how do you expect to get to new york at the rate you're going that's none of your business you're on a budget from now on not just a minute,0.09444914
you did it,0.08996765
it happened one night is such an interesting film for,0.055737358
so many reasons,0.10361708
it follows the story of alan andrews played by claudette colbert who runs away from her very wealthy father and meets peter warren played by clark gable on the bus on the road shenanigans of course follow clark gable in this film is funny he's hilarious i never truly realized what a funny man he actually isn't he's a great comedic actor and no scene shows it better than the probably the most famous scene in the film the hitchhiking scene i was in stitches watching this the other night it's hilarious,0.09763065
do you mind,0.07765881
if i try you don't make me laugh,0.15063415
oh you're such a smart aleck,0.23976195
nobody knows anything,0.1506249
but you i'll stop a car,0.31089434
and i won't use my thumb,0.13081746
what are you going to do the system all my own,0.081351906
i wrote down in my notes uh when i was watching that film the other night when i watched that scene yes queen like good for you good for you girl uh gable and cod bear were not the first choices to play ellen and peter robert montgomery and mirnaloy were the original choices at the studio wanted,0.1767039
but after both reading the original script they both turned down the role mona loy,0.06221157
did later say that the final film beared no resemblance to,0.07608948
the first script that she read,0.07771524
so i'd be very interested to uh read or know what that original script was clark gable and claudette colbert were too both satisfied with the script but claudette colbert agreed to appear on the film if her salary was doubled to fifty thousand dollars for the whole picture,0.06347276
and clark gable wasn't really given a choice,0.07973204
he was loaned to columbia studios which produced this film from his studio mgm as a sort of punishment because he refused to do an earlier film with mgm,0.09666817
so he didn't really he had to do it,0.070220225
he'd have a choice as you can imagine filming wasn't a walk in the park um,0.0936889
claudette,0.07680357
cobia really did not want to shoot this film,0.40185112
she did not make it a fun event,0.14736618
and she was very unhappy with the hitchhiking scene,0.30042082
she did not want to flush her leg,0.5780613
she called it unladylike,0.27305302
but the director got his way and she flashed her leg the director later accused her of throwing little tantrums throughout filming and when it was all wrapped claudette colbert said to her friend i quote i just finished the worst picture in the world how wrong she was take me with you peter,0.31089434
take me to your island,0.13575204
i want to do all those things,0.09248513
you talked about you better go back to your bed,0.46407336
i love you nothing else matters,0.1144988
but we can run away everything will take care of itself,0.12251546
please peter i can't let you out of my life,0.40315142
now i couldn't live without you you'd better go back to your bed,0.5898615
the thing that makes it happen one night for me,0.08743391
so interesting is the fact that it was one of the last films to be released before the 1934 motion picture production code was enforced which lasted until 1968,0.055444602
so the production motion picture production code,0.04985677
there were strict guidelines for what could and couldn't be shown on film that really regarded mainly uh crime violence and sex for example an on-screen kiss couldn't be shown for longer than three seconds,0.30146065
but a lot of directors kind of found their way around it,0.06478589
it happened one night there are heaps of sexual innuendos,0.51288
and this particular scene where clark gable is undressing himself nearly takes off his pants like it was so shocking for me to see a shirtless clark gable i'm so used to watching films from that era with the production code in place where you know everything is is sugar and spice and everything nice,0.15127964
it was quite jarring in a way but also really kind of awesome also side note uh pre-code hollywood is a very interesting place there were no rules at all,0.064323306
so you could shoot whatever you wanted more interesting than hollywood now even so i'll definitely be talking about that in the future also interestingly it happened one night was the inspiration behind bugs bunny fritz freiling who came up with bugs loved it happened one night and took inspiration from clark gables character who was nicknamed bugs,0.20527755
it happened one night was a massive success upon release,0.050301485
and became one of only three films to win the buy of the vive,0.09170726
the five the big academy awards which include best film best director best actor best actress and best screenplay,0.049277846
the only other two films to do that were the one who flew over the cuckoo's nest,0.17731886
and the science of the lamps true to form claudette colbert did not think she'd win for this movie,0.10265474
so she didn't even bother to show up to the academy awards,0.116938464
i would love to know your thoughts on this film have you seen it um,0.11135893
and i i was thinking about this the other day i just find it so crazy that this film isn't almost 90 years old and can still make a girl in 2020 laugh that to me is just the power of films so comment below your thoughts,0.37663227
