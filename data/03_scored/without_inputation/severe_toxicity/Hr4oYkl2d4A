what's up ladies and gentlemen its Daniel here from the geeks big nation Channel and,0.11174686
I'm here to bring you my review of Casablancas only one ever gave you the,0.057813108
impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape because my dear Ricky I,0.023872111
suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist Olaf if you will,0.1368928
but I have to be familiar with the record let me point out just two,0.006682435
items in 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia in 1936 you fought in Spain on,0.29068857
the loyalist side I got well paid for it on both occasions the winning side,0.074138045
would have paid you much better robbery haha well it seems that you're determined to,0.048022266
keep Laszlo here I have my orders well I see Gestapo spank My dear Ricky,0.3505285
you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo I don't interfere with them and they don't,0.08502976
interfere with me in Casablanca I'm master of my fate I am major Strasser is,0.042375524
here sir he was saying excuse me so you clicked on the video and you're,0.11107835
probably wondering to yourself why is Daniel reviewing the 1942-43 film because there was released,0.021503393
in the United States during that Casablanca what what about this film why is he,0.024857247
reviewing it so I am taking an independent study course underneath one of my professors,0.07637838
here at my college and so I'm gonna be working on films I'm gonna be,0.04245934
shooting short films and things that nature I'm really excited but it's as a part,0.27410275
of the course I'm writing essays about films and watching films and analyzing them and,0.047112297
so one of my first films was Casablanca and in what we're talking about right,0.044513423
now is American noir filmmaking and so this is gonna be a kind of artsy,0.1024303
fartsy when it comes of this review is I did a lot of time analyzing,0.14517102
specific elements about this film so with that guys I'm gonna be doing a lot,0.080493875
more of these classic films so keep that in mind because you know I just,0.076788135
want to find a way to incorporate what I'm doing in class into my own,0.06655229
personal life and continue to have fun with movies because I just love talking about,0.04574202
them so much so let's get on with this review 1942 Casablanca this film is,0.03275697
a classic by all means of the definition I can say that I don't really,0.019403407
watch many classical movies I don't know if it's really a fault to just mean,0.04084294
not taking the time out to go do that or I just haven't really had,0.023626657
much time to be introduced to them but nevertheless really really old classical films I,0.096112385
have really haven't had the chance to watch many of them I haven't seen films,0.02195106
like Citizen Kane but that's about it and so I need to really explain my,0.028981386
repertoire of classic films but sometimes when you go back and watch old black-and-white films,0.017393887
it in a certain sense it can't quite compare using Citizen Kane as example sometimes,0.04106445
for me as a modern movie goer in this current day and age it's different,0.04518659
for me you know I've seen movies like The Dark Knight I've seen you know,0.014930712
I've seen drive I've seen all these things that I loved or the prestige and,0.025598928
I've seen all these crazy movies that I love and I have had such an,0.09853233
impact of meat and have blown my mind so that when I go back and,0.07504469
watch something like Citizen Kane sometimes it gets hard for me to appreciate what that,0.06410308
film is because of the time period it came out in and just how far,0.038490187
it was pushing the boundaries and just how amazing of a film really is so,0.038690407
I try to push that aside and try to really analyze the film for what,0.027245257
it is and not only by modern standards but also just enjoy the film for,0.02555037
its value and the story that is trying to tell and how it tells it,0.015681705
but I can honestly say that Casablanca is an amazing amazing film and that it,0.021406274
is a film that transcends time in a sense that it no matter when you,0.043584164
watch it is always gonna have that same impact that no matter new goers for,0.038844064
this film or old ones the story is just so riveting and intense it's part,0.04223251
political thriller but also part you know American war film but also part melodrama and,0.07532207
part romance it's it's really really engaging and I really did not expect that going,0.020433111
into this film and just being really just blown away by just how engaged I,0.17551403
was watching this film as if it was just any other crime drama I had,0.04247663
just tuned into watching on cable or something like that I'm kidding no one watches,0.08565038
cable so Casablanca the story revolves around Rick played for the amazing Humphrey Bogart who,0.042303685
owns this you know this kind of gambling den the seedy kind of place inside,0.090653226
of the play inside of Casablanca the city underneath Nazi regime occupation and the story,0.22347404
revolves around him meeting this femme fatale from his past his former lover this former,0.042885054
flame here's looking to you kid who comes out of his past and comes back,0.14444795
to haunt him in a sense and comes back with the proposition based off who,0.086807795
she is with now and this whole entire political aspect that goes really into it,0.037228335
I don't know why I'm being so cryptic I mean the film came out in,0.05024265
1942 his former lover is buried - the leader of you know this political rebels,0.10724157
against the Nazi regime and what I found the most interesting about the film not,0.17830646
just that you know the commentary it had on you know the socio-political asked the,0.0144497845
you know atmosphere at the time but the character of Rick himself was someone very,0.011765769
interesting to me I think even in the moment you're first introduced to Rick in,0.034320816
the film he is playing at a chessboard alone side room in in we we,0.030901771
spent a lot of time analyzing the lighting in this film because it is something,0.028074741
phenomenal just looking at the scene where you're looking at the gambling den it's bright,0.05027591
it's lively it's smoky it's hazy it has all these weird characters and guys going,0.07333184
around probably doing some not good things you know not blatantly out and open there's,0.033915717
nothing crazy like prostitution or anything like that going on something obvious going on but,0.4114341
you know the people in here are doing things going beyond that and this is,0.019339548
this world living in this world where refugees and human flesh you know human beings,0.5287139
have price tags to them and human beings are just you know this this currency,0.22925568
during this time period and it's very you know it's very like engaging and just,0.038987078
makes your skin kind of crawl and when we're first introduced to Rick he's in,0.13554913
the side room playing chess like I said and the light the way the lighting,0.03402614
is you know it just illuminates his hands like he's playing this game or whatever,0.041983064
whatever a visual metaphor you want to go into there's a lot that you can,0.023023337
dissect from this film you know of this man who plays his game and the,0.066423245
whites but he the way the shadows are going it's like it's the shadows are,0.23249969
just really just making up you know the outline of his face and it's so,0.07662051
interesting as if he is a man who's you know created morphed and you know,0.12932433
just defined by the shadows his dark past which I found really interesting and that,0.023215575
he he is more so of an antihero and is not really a hero of,0.0866415
an of itself I think he is a man who has a good heart who,0.07243584
has good intentions he wants to do good in the world but he sees the,0.055997156
circumstances again and he's just a product of that and he's trying to adapt without,0.015492127
fully losing who he truly is and it's such a powerful character and Humphrey Bogart,0.046705205
gives an amazing performance because he comes off as like you know this like he's,0.092098005
given this villainous introduction and he comes off as like this guy who just you,0.12238914
know he's very smart he's a one step ahead of the next guy he doesn't,0.0661299
care about this he's just doing this to survive to just get on day by,0.07100902
day you know what drives this guy but when his ex-lover comes back into his,0.086465225
life and that changes who he completely is because when he goes into that drunken,0.116714455
tirade with Sam at the club and everything's closed down in the shadows are on,0.055123102
him again when he's going back reflecting into his past that shapes him and haunts,0.060233045
him you you get this this version of Rick it was just so broken and,0.05180317
so driven by his you know his his heartbreak his ache you know but how,0.048217833
much he was kicked down by the world and how much wrong has been done,0.243725
upon him and that he's done upon others so interesting and just so riveting just,0.07023009
looking at Rick's character and all that he goes through I think the ex-lover played,0.014677277
by Ingrid I just typed the paper on this and I can't remember her last,0.07404425
name but actress Ingrid did a really amazing job as portraying the character that I,0.04757593
believed at the time wasn't very popular you know this very driven independent character who,0.017402535
can function without her partner and and but yet still enjoys and has desires and,0.15183814
there's nothing wrong having a character that's presented that doesn't have a care about you,0.031779815
know what others think of her and what she has and what she wants she's,0.03450108
gonna go for it no matter how selfish it is or you know just how,0.06355963
it benefits others she's going to try to go after what she wants and she's,0.07484979
a very strong character and it's very interesting and the way she also just like,0.012185499
Rick is conflicted about all that time they spent together and all this you know,0.034376692
there's turmoil they went through after separating due to various circumstances as you all may,0.025647486
know if you've seen the film I truly think it was just really really an,0.01988234
amazing performance by her and also the you know the Spanish officer who would help,0.024442174
the escape at the end and things of that nature who also plays more of,0.017215617
a villainous role there's just amazing performances in this film and some amazing uses of,0.02673373
lighting which is really key in this film and just how they use darkness and,0.027879177
I think that's a you know an a tribute to the characteristics of film noir,0.061137028
which I found really interesting and just what made the genre so great is its,0.02050229
atmosphere and just how engrossing it really is and I'm really glad I got a,0.03214633
sense of that going into the film but I think the only thing I didn't,0.017763063
really like about the film just the ending uh-oh which is really bold because I,0.026979849
mean come on it's one of the most iconic endings of all time you just,0.1175925
looking at you kid and getting on the plane and everything you know this is,0.06056098
it's like the start of a beautiful friendship you know all that stuff but I,0.09884562
think I guess it's this comes I have to tribute the semi modern sensibilities but,0.018629134
the third act is just like it's kind of like I wouldn't say rushed but,0.021535985
it's just like it kind of suspends believability at certain parts because he just he,0.06273746
just shoots the Nazi commander and he's like hey the command has been shot gang,0.572029
there's just like alright we're not gonna check your pocket we're not gonna check anybody,0.13564958
in this room right now who's in near this dead guy y'all just walk out,0.3261416
of the hangar bay I actually expected a more tragic ending for Rick I think,0.028624183
his ending is gonna be inevitably tragic afterwards you know he's gonna be an enemy,0.1783497
eventually of the Nazi regime and this and I think this from 1942 you know,0.2250045
warden until 45 so a lot can happen over those few years especially acting as,0.04136644
someone trying to work against the Nazi regime and just seeing the side redemptive quality,0.20572866
was really great but somehow that ending man was just really really weird it's really,0.05105484
weird and it's just like this is beginning of a beautiful friendship forget that part,0.039926317
where I tried to kill you I helped you know alright that's how it's gonna,0.64675766
happen and he's just like okay okay you know what this is iconic I just,0.0824575
I guess I gotta just let this slide but besides that I really enjoyed Casablanca,0.035297304
and obviously really had a great time and see that it is a masterful work,0.031113965
of filmmaking and it is a film I really enjoyed and want to watch more,0.037120573
times than what I have and see it multiple times again even though I have,0.028915534
watched the heck out of this movie so with that ladies and gentlemen I'm going,0.20439564
to give Casablanca a 9 out of 10 so have you seen Casa Blanca let,0.053473447
