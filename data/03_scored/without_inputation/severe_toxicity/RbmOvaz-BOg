film review for you today i'll be reviewing the movie the wizard of oz released,0.06773565
in 1939. starring judy garland frank morgan and ray bolger directed by victor fleming the,0.015517404
synopsis is a young farm girl in kansas is transported to the land of oz,0.1055826
and receives help from unusual friends to get back home the story this film is,0.011764438
an adaptation of the famous 1900s children's book the wonderful wizard of oz by l,0.12167872
frank baum the author was inspired to write the story after a trip in 1890,0.032748986
where he witnessed a cyclone in aberdeen south dakota and around the same time his,0.04247996
wife's niece dorothy had passed away the name for oz was chosen at a glance,0.11337656
at his filing cabinet where he saw a through n and o through z the,0.13464715
idea for the story closely resembles alice in wonderland written by lewis carroll about a,0.044975728
young girl traveling to a strange fantasy land in 1902 a broadway musical inspired bomb,0.14403021
to write 13 sequels to the book two short films were made in 1910 the,0.027768757
wonderful wizard of oz and the land of oz then there was a feature film,0.033802636
patchwork girl of oz in 1914 the wizard of oz in 1925 and its sequel,0.12462016
the land of oz in 1932. the rights changed hands from samuel goldwyn to mgm,0.016096778
in 1934 and although at the time the studio was looking into making a film,0.048404083
with a few stars it wasn't until 1937 that the rights were put to use,0.031099996
as it was trying to replicate the success of disney's snow white and the seven,0.043959327
dwarfs released that year in 1937. now speaking of disney disney also wanted to make,0.02017369
the wizard of oz would later go on to make the return to oz which,0.023342624
was released many years later in 1985 the muppets wizard of oz released in 2005,0.026049256
and as the great powerful released in 2013. in fact there was a short time,0.012073749
that mgm and disney discussed possibly combining forces to make a film but that didn't,0.007999498
quite work out so can you believe that it took 14 writers along with the,0.018134901
actors and directors to help write the script that's pretty incredible we've seen so many,0.016910298
cases where there are too many cooks in the kitchen that could sour the meal,0.04801628
but in this case it works and perhaps it was because it was a collaborative,0.042035617
effort by people who were vastly familiar with the book and wanted to do it,0.012000578
justice the greatest inspiration came from the book but there were a few things about,0.043731168
the book that the film couldn't do because it was a movie and there was,0.025668772
only a certain amount of time to tell the story for instance in the book,0.014330051
dorothy encounters the field mice the hammerheads the dainty china country and the country of,0.17206638
the quadlings just to name a few the characters were condensed to make the story,0.015742902
more palatable which i thought was an excellent choice it really makes the story a,0.014216305
little more snappier getting to the point of the adventure dorothy's slippers were originally silver,0.03940814
in the book but the studio realized that the technicolor production would benefit from the,0.024367006
slippers being bolder in color so that it stood out they chose red but by,0.033525255
calling it ruby slippers it had more of a magical effect another part of the,0.018290555
story that had to be curtailed was the amount of violence that was permitted to,0.050897192
be shown in 1939 for instance in the book the wizard commands the group to,0.008446502
actually kill the wicked witch and not just get her broomstick the film borrowed ideas,0.6842905
from the wizard of oz version in 1925 by using the farmhands in kansas as,0.017934017
symbolic characters and oz and this is actually a way that it helped to tell,0.012780174
the story better i rather liked most of the differences in the film and it's,0.02019564
basically you know really well put together until about the end where there's a few,0.046985913
things that kind of fall apart for me actually since now watching it as an,0.034059398
adult the dialogue is very dated but appropriate for this fun light-hearted story somehow it's,0.025493164
been cherished decades after decades making it timeless in a way the pacing in an,0.022038199
hour and 42 minutes it's pretty good no complaints for me it always gets a,0.030459424
bit murky once the quartet assembles and especially slows down after the group meets the,0.06876868
wizard for the first time but generally i don't have much to complain about the,0.018756848
flow of the film the challenge the challenge in this story seems to be obviously,0.018637115
the main wicked witch of the west and her real world counterpart miss elmira gulch,0.52104384
and i agree that she is a challenge but i also feel as if this,0.0270018
challenge is part of a bigger problem for our protagonists coming of age at the,0.057030186
start of the film elmira has an order to take dorothy's dog toto because he,0.07424447
keeps terrorizing her and chasing her cat he even bit her elmira is not just,0.24903055
mad at dorothy because she's mean she has had enough and as a kid watching,0.08144508
this film i never noticed that elmira was actually sounding off real complaints about dorothy,0.08638008
and her lack of responsibility towards toto and that was because i was completely distracted,0.058397803
by her mean approach i really feel bad about that because technically elmira is in,0.058019977
the right here so much so that dorothy's aunt and couldn't really stop elmira from,0.04093141
taking toto away well let's get into it a little deeper after watching and reading,0.06881391
many reviews about this film a lot of people think that dorothy wants to leave,0.03527136
kansas because the grass is greener out there but that's not true because she likes,0.06779219
it in kansas but she's completely out of place no one listens to her and,0.0634226
she seems to be in everyone's way it's to the point that any m actually,0.033597097
says find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble and that is,0.033291776
when she sings the iconic song somewhere over the rainbow longing to find a place,0.057723306
where dreams really do come true and all this happens before elmira even enters the,0.0570242
film so ultimately dorothy runs away from home to save toto from mrs gulch when,0.055038624
she learns that her aunt and uncle will be heartbroken it is then that love,0.061603323
brings her home to face her problems and she has had a big change of,0.053766128
heart right at the beginning of the film now if you notice the cyclone happens,0.016346224
right after dorothy is on her way back home symbolizing her internal shift turning her,0.045565747
perception of the world upside down after yearning for a world without any trouble dorothy,0.08428209
finds herself in a whole lot more trouble once she arrives on oz the grass,0.089085385
is not always greener and running away from one's problems can cause more of them,0.013528505
these are the lessons that dorothy is learning but let's get back to the obvious,0.011729184
challenge of the wicked witch of the west the wicked witch after hearing that dorothy,0.56325704
killed her sister is irate and i would say that would be a very natural,0.80814576
response anyone would be traumatized by this and angry when the wicked witch tries to,0.24150713
take her sister's ruby slipper which are rightfully hers to decide what to do with,0.0764143
possibly a sentimental value they're actually taken away and put on her sister's killer's feet,0.4627605
wow that that's really messed up there's been a terrible injustice that has been done,0.022844402
to her i think that you know when i was a kid i i was,0.067140974
so distracted by the physical representation of what the film says is good or wicked,0.092451215
and i did not see how wrong our protagonists are but one great difference in,0.017298765
this film and the book is the depth that they give the wicked witch and,0.40799695
as a villain she is very impressive and one of the most iconic villains of,0.09412814
pop culture now the empathy one thing that we get from this film is that,0.045565747
we get incredible likeable characters as much as dorothy may be irresponsible with toto oh,0.049125142
she's just so adorable and incredibly likable you really instantly just take her side you,0.21377937
just you just want her to find her rainbow right her character arc actually happens,0.040455803
in the beginning of the film when she chooses to go back to the farm,0.031260304
and face her problems but the lesson isn't over from her experience she is having,0.04898745
sort of a revelation within she seems to have an actual physical look of shock,0.063937455
throughout the entire film as we are witnessing dorothy's internal awe-inspiring change and most of,0.01782027
all dorothy represents the innocence in us all and at one point another in our,0.0146812685
lives when we decide to be better human beings than we once were and i,0.21826738
think of the friends that dorothy encounters in oz are really symbolic representations are the,0.013398794
things that dorothy needs in order to face reality like logic love or otherwise compassion,0.04630543
for others and most of all courage to do the right thing and once over,0.03603832
these things are already in her ability the scarecrow is a man made out of,0.14935368
straw and the first friend that she meets he is stuck upon a pole as,0.12666759
dorothy has been stuck in her way of thinking i believe that the scarecrow who,0.1110564
seeks a brain was to show how important critical thinking is using logic and common,0.14580892
sense can help a person deal with many daily problems the real world version of,0.020739095
the scarecrow hunk tells dorothy that she should use her head about mrs gulch and,0.20555305
not walk past her house on the way home so toto wouldn't get in trouble,0.033340335
and really that makes a whole lot of sense the tin man is an extremely,0.05625591
mild-mannered and consider it tin woodman abandoned in the forest he is the symbol of,0.047234025
compassion as he desires a physical representation of that in a heart he is the,0.02508341
compassion that dorothy needs to be considerate of other people dorothy didn't really take in,0.020813596
consideration that she might be causing elmira some distress over her cat and her property,0.07424381
the cowardly lion is probably one of the most sympathetic characters of all time but,0.12630907
he's full of comedic moments you either feel sorry for him or despise him but,0.048319604
either way his reaction to problems is a lot like dorothy's when she decides to,0.029172959
run away from the farm instead of facing them the cowardly lion is pretty cowardly,0.31730315
and hardly gets a chance to show that he has any courage at all but,0.029245464
there is a scene in which it's time to save dorothy from the wicked witch,0.31771836
and the scarecrow tells him that he has to be the one to lead them,0.1140903
sort of like your mental skills as a person near your logic telling yourself hey,0.26953998
you've got to do this one thing and in response the lion says he'll do,0.01733269
it for dorothy so when pushed against the wall courage kicks in when the wizard,0.13987415
of oz gives the cowardly lion a badge of honor at the end of the,0.21469668
film he tells him that he has the wisdom to know when to face danger,0.05294995
or to run away this is a very valuable attribute that dorothy needs when she,0.036702838
goes back home to kansas the friends that dorothy meet are seeking things that they,0.012484832
already have inside them just as dorothy already has all of these attributes inside of,0.09782922
her and now all she has to do is recognize them and use them now,0.052056607
the technical aspects it actually took five directors to make this film with victor fleming,0.02722131
taking the main credit for the final product during the filming there were several replaced,0.028695358
actors and changes in the look of the characters seeing some of the pictures really,0.012764209
make you wonder how the film would have been seeing these iconic characters and their,0.01563248
potential alternative costumes it just proves how very important it is to get the costuming,0.038808808
just right because it is one of the most outstanding results that make the film,0.013662872
so captivating the work done for the costumes and makeup really hold up over time,0.03455097
and it's truly remarkable as there is so much emphasis on getting things truly right,0.022816464
in many scenes dorothy's hair appears to be at different lengths due to the costumed,0.027954342
switches and many of the scenes were re-shot several times the witch was originally just,0.14548099
to look like an appealing modern woman however to stick more closely to the book,0.14667831
the filmmakers decided to make the witch look more sinister with exaggerated features and i,0.23751925
especially liked the idea of putting her hair back in a bun the green makeup,0.19016802
was a wonderful touch that was absolutely exquisitely done the prosthetics used for the wicked,0.20803352
witch was actually also very well done for 1938 and nearly undetectable in some scenes,0.17716967
the actors unfortunately had to suffer quite a bit for their costume work as well,0.22591995
as some actors we didn't even get to see on screen more commonly known the,0.019422697
tig man was originally to be played by buddy epson who was well into the,0.054342177
production having recorded music and filled much of the tin man scenes until he fell,0.10855398
ill due to an allergic reaction to the makeup that was used for the character,0.036921017
real lion skin and fur was used to make the cowardly lions costume to give,0.10393428
it an authentic look which was heavy and extremely hot so you can imagine that,0.071097486
the combination of dead animals and sweat made that costume really stinky mgm recruited extra,0.30086625
help from the studio mail room and courier service to become makeup artists each recruit,0.05379207
was instructed in one area of prosthetic application for an assembly line process each morning,0.0143094305
one interesting thing that happened was that the wardrobe department accidentally chose a coat for,0.017775703
professor marvel from a second hand store which turned out to have a label indicating,0.03605362
that the coat had been made for the late al frank bomb there are a,0.13227044
lot of creative hacks on this film to pull off unique visual feats the horses,0.07358261
in the mrl city palace were colored with jello crystals so you can actually see,0.05771998
the horses lick it off in a few scenes the famous surrender dorothy skywriting scene,0.37256342
was done using a tank of water and a tiny model of the witch very,0.13397132
creative the tornado was a 35 foot long muslin stocking spun around the look is,0.06691814
very impressive the shot of dorothy's house falling from the sky was a reverse shot,0.12892988
of a miniature house being dropped onto a painting of the sky i think that's,0.046724495
completely genius the sets gloriously bask in all of its colorful splendor exploring this fantasy,0.09393723
world with great creativity these were all decorated sound stages but that's part of the,0.08239696
charm it's almost as if we're flipping through the pages of the book and looking,0.037178446
at those beautiful imaginative illustrations ey harburg and harold arlen were given 14 weeks to,0.11216127
come up with the film's musical score and it is truly a classic and you,0.020998517
you absolutely know it when you hear it and you can't help singing along to,0.027498027
the songs the song over the rainbow was nearly cut from the film can you,0.02502953
believe that it won an oscar for best music original song and this was judy,0.026635949
garland's signature song until her passing it was also ranked number one by the american,0.078915395
film institute in 2004 on the 100 greatest songs in america's films list as well,0.01903423
as re-recorded by several musical artists performances to me the performances were fantastic because the,0.01307352
actors are acting the way that they were instructed to and this is a stylized,0.020349298
form of acting of overacting actually specifically to appeal to the children of 1939 it's,0.057018213
all a part of america's wholesome image at the time now does the acting hold,0.044035822
up yes and no we know it's corny and it's actually part of the reason,0.12688245
why the film is so entertaining endearing and dare i say magical it just wouldn't,0.045723394
be as bewitching if it were acted differently it would probably be i mean i,0.04949299
would have to say it would probably be really boring it wouldn't be as fun,0.038748942
and julie garland was wonderful as dorothy though she's not wearing a visually cumbersome costume,0.21390842
she actually suffered a lot for the role having to wear a very painful corset,0.2296007
around her torso to look more like a pre-adolescent child and the beautiful ruby slippers,0.20187326
were rumored to be quite torturous to wear frank morgan was incredible playing the role,0.016826486
of professor marvel the wizard of oz the gatekeeper the carriage driver and the guard,0.021176122
he plays all of the parts very jolly and boisterous with a chameleon charm ray,0.11788318
bulger played hulk and the scarecrow excellently putting his fabulous acrobatic dancing skills on show,0.21140002
rey said later in interviews that the rubber prosthetic that he had to wear on,0.071662895
his face that mimicked a woven pattern actually left lines on his face that took,0.24673319
more than a year to vanish bert lahr as zeke and the cowardly lion was,0.19189218
great having so much great delivery of his comedic dialogue uh he brings forth many,0.031201769
of the most funniest and endearing moments of comedy in the film jack haley was,0.011456458
fantastic as hickory and the tin man he manipulated his voice while playing the tin,0.12722369
man saying that he felt that the tone should be soft something like the way,0.04018308
he would read a bedtime story to his son it was a wonderful decision as,0.027135503
you really get the sense of how compassionate and sensitive his character is in the,0.02204485
film one of the biggest standouts in this is margaret hamilton playing mrs gulch and,0.07545511
the wicked witch of the west her iconic performance is the only way that you,0.46816343
can put you can call it it's just iconic was so thrilling and memorable that,0.030184703
it's been copied quoted and obsessed about through the decades margaret hamilton said that her,0.042021647
approach to the character was that the wicked witch was a person who relished everything,0.2381948
she did but who ultimately was a sad lonely figure a woman who lived in,0.0873599
constant frustration and she never got what she wanted and you really get the sense,0.07925264
of that from her performance the film was also very popular for the over 100,0.013944245
little people who would make up the citizens of munchkinland as a kid seeing them,0.29584482
was a very magical experience i mean i just wanted to live in munchkin land,0.17064887
because everything there was so happy and lively and you know their performance was such,0.022557043
a big part of the nostalgic enchantment of the film and paved the way for,0.01095757
so many actors of short stature the best part of the film the whole thing,0.030074948
i just love this movie so much and i find the the i find it,0.059352342
so very amazing and fun i i enjoy myself every time i and i specifically,0.060513087
cry at the scene where dorothy is singing the song over the rainbow i it's,0.047516063
a guarantee every single time the ending the ending wraps up pretty quickly but it,0.08505836
works for me mad tv spoofed the ending and asked the same question of many,0.060847674
of the fans who wondered about the good witch glinda why didn't she tell dorothy,0.11565215
how to get home as soon as she put on those ruby slippers but i,0.060520403
think that the biggest problem here is that that the good witch glinda is actually,0.10834312
a combination of the good witch of the north and the good witch of the,0.2262475
south and if they were two different characters i believe it would have made more,0.044454888
sense as a storytelling piece my wish list sadly many of the wicked witch of,0.27378076
the west's scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely because they were deemed too frightening,0.06349178
for audiences but i would have loved to have seen them because those critics who,0.04538814
say that the wicked witch is more bark than bite i am hoping that those,0.34198132
clips would have changed their minds perhaps this was also part of the symbolism so,0.011942707
and the wicked witch isn't really a very hard challenge for the group so in,0.38705054
a way the wicked witch really stands for a challenge that really seems like it's,0.3647438
much bigger and harder to get over than it is nonetheless i would love to,0.050023805
have seen those scenes where she's a little nastier and uh moreover it seems like,0.3737071
the whole thing really wraps up really fast at the end it could have used,0.01921117
about five more minutes of storytelling my enjoyment i like so many other people grew,0.059781384
up seeing the wizard of oz at least once or twice a year since i,0.022942184
was a kid and it's really filled me with a great deal of wonder about,0.046333365
dorothy and this land of oz i've read the books and i've read different adaptations,0.033211954
i've seen so many different adaptations on film and it's just something that's still very,0.02631533
the only word i could think of to describe this is magical i think i,0.03534653
may have used that word at least six or seven times maybe eight more times,0.013988812
in this video but it's truly the only word i could think of to really,0.0598346
describe this movie it still has that same feeling for me every time i watch,0.03415718
this film it's still there and that's what really makes it a classic the film,0.052223567
wasn't a big hit at the box office though uh when it came out 44,0.11450738
million people tuned in to see its first television broadcast on november 3rd 1956 and,0.034570925
aired every single year often on easter sunday on cbs for nearly 40 years according,0.09233946
to the library of congress the wizard of oz is the most watched film ever,0.024816006
and this is one thing most of us have in common with each other at,0.038468234
least at one point or another most of us have seen this there's no place,0.022494515
like home is the last mantra that the film instills in to its viewers leaving,0.01371143
many with the idea that dorothy learns not to venture out into the world but,0.02090273
to love it right at home i think that doesn't really make a lot of,0.034113944
sense because it doesn't tie into her change of heart just before the cyclone takes,0.018629799
her to us instead and this is just my point of view i believe that,0.022157932
dorothy learns how to use her logic and how to love and to have courage,0.039479315
in order to deal with her real life circumstances at home and she needs not,0.090508215
seek happiness anywhere else if she can't have it at home and i kind of,0.073628515
really love that message because it's it's about being an individual wherever you are bringing,0.047461517
with you the the upbringing that your family has taught you and bringing with you,0.11350228
your standards and and your sense of self wherever you go so no matter where,0.28320417
you are you're always at home my rating is a 9.5 well that sums up,0.03683654
my review this is retro nerd girl signing off take care movie lovers i'm off,0.40591812
