saying that felt badass I don't know why did I have like no coat on,0.21904032
and that's the whole point of the movie so MLK and his followers can get,0.02854702
desegregated from southern law of Selma so they can vote now going into this movie,0.036045637
I thought it was just gonna base it off Martin Luther King Jr's life and,0.04932669
the struggles he had a face although I did show the second part it didn't,0.03399288
really show a whole lot of his life there's usually movies such as Jay Edgar,0.04250856
do that and usually turns into quite a mess he actually sets you up right,0.08461335
from the get-go and it focuses on the much bigger picture with a great amount,0.019744646
of focus Selma was actually a pretty damn good movie the acting in this movie,0.20161384
was just phenomenal David oh yeah I had lo Lloyd Lloyd I can't pronounce his,0.057813108
name his portrayal of Martin Luther King was extremely spot-on for some scenes I thought,0.01725819

imagine when the Oscars come around he's gonna get nominated for Best Actor I mean,0.03551881
it's his movie they showed him in his glorifying moments but what I love most,0.042801242
about his portrayals that they covered parts of his life that not too many people,0.09648622
know about because throughout the whole movie I was like are they gonna cover that,0.027025746
because not only does it affect his character but it also affects the civil rights,0.025416667
movement in itself and they did cover it I'm not gonna tell you what it,0.061383814
is but I was just another way for people to go against him so he,0.07148396
can fail his mission he just showed that this legendary historical figure is vulnerable and,0.034260284
I thought it was a great balance of character I mean even some of the,0.031252988
supporting casts was really great like the woman who plays Coretta Scott King yeah I,0.0903785
don't know where her name is either I feel really bad because they all have,0.047557306
parts of where they stand out as their own character and I thought it was,0.04697527
really cool being translated to scream and a part of that had to do with,0.035291985
the extremely well-written script and the dialogue going on between the characters you know the,0.018427582
movie Lincoln with Daniel day-lewis yeah we all know the dude owned that role those,0.015749553
scenes were he's talking to someone and he's telling stories about his or something like,0.035096418
that as he's speaking you're like yeah cool and you're taking something from his words,0.057085395
same thing with a guy who plays Martin Luther King jr. he's given his speeches,0.062211964
and you're just really inspired by that I'm serious I had a big fat dumb,0.50687444
smile on my face during love scenes and when I got to the scenes of,0.08050252
the civil rights movement holy that was extremely hard to watch this movie is rated,0.09166563
pg-13 so they couldn't fully capture the brutality of the situation so it was just,0.044695687
enough to get to a point where it was horrifying since these activists got the,0.06017451
kicked out of them just sucks what they had to go through so they can,0.68104804
be equal to everybody imagine like that being televised like in this movie they wouldn't,0.024171444
allow it of course bill would still be awful to watch it got emotional for,0.055355918
some scenes and for a movie I gotta give it props now some parts in,0.06479886
the movie like when it comes to the timeline I thought was just done okay,0.046588134
cuz they get to certain moments of the movie where you feel it's important to,0.028002236
MLK's mission and his cause but then all of a sudden it just cuts away,0.066584885
and they don't handle that situation anymore I wish I would know more about that,0.028626177
but I know it's a movie and there's only so much they can cover cuz,0.042472642
I am a huge fan of history and it's always fun to know these little,0.018192772

scenes were executed really good and some not so great I wish they would cover,0.5858923
more on some parts but I'm not gonna hold it entirely because of that so,0.043458443
