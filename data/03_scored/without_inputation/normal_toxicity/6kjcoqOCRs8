alright,0.048265677
this is the second video in my rewatch series these are movies that I've either done years ago that I think still look and sound great or maybe I just haven't gotten the time to do a review which brings us to the movie that I just re-watched 2015's Mad Max fury road on 4k and 3d blu-ray I won't be reviewing the movie itself I'm just going to be sharing with you some of my thoughts on the video and the audio quality now let's just go over a few tech specs the movie was shot in 2.8,0.12370749
K,0.025692256
it's got a 2k di,0.15050288
it's rated R runtime is 120 minutes,0.094568335
there's also a 3d version of the movie but it wasn't shot natively,0.1237223
so it is a 3d conversion aspect,0.104017705
ratio is to 400 by 1 which means it'll have those black letterbox bars yes I watched both the 4k and 3-d blu-rays and honestly I can watch this either way because they're both knockout transfers as for sharpness and clarity the 4k version is the clear winner environmental textures like individual grains of dirt and sand the rock formations and even the clouds get a big boost over the 1080p version,0.18753146
the close-up shots are crazy detailed to where you can make out the dry caked on makeup on a more and Joe's face and body and those details such as wrinkles pores and scars or rendered,0.31822252
multitudes better than the standard blu-ray where the 4k really takes a big leap is,0.06513896
in the HDR department colors are highly saturated to the point,0.044248138
you might think they're overly saturated,0.1597999
so the image tends to look a bit hot,0.35676447
the desert shots are a lot warmer coming from the regular blu-ray and those fiery explosions and flames shooting from the exhausts are extremely red and overcooked the flames can come off a little too CGI looking and sometimes flat,0.19374779
what HDR does is boost the overall picture brightness,0.074084915
it's not one of those dim HDR transfers it's actually really really bright from beginning to end expect to see a ton of specular,0.19740666
and peak highlights from reflective chrome surfaces explosions and anything that might look shiny black levels are extremely dark and contrasting and just elevates the image depth and separation,0.06923958
and speaking of image depth the 3d version while it doesn't have the same color pop or added resolution does make for a fun,0.07295123
and I think more engaging viewing experience first off the color seemed more balanced without the overly cooked color grade not that anything is terribly wrong with the HDR version but you might find yourself preferring the more toned down standard and 3d versions,0.15072049
I found the separation between foreground middle and background layers to reach pretty deeply inwards on my projection setup the sandstorm never fails to impress as you'll see sand and debris blowing right past your face,0.19901294
there is one point in the movie where Max's foot breaks the black bar barrier but other than that there's still a good amount of things coming towards the screen I should also mention that there are some times you get that flat cardboard cutout,0.17297868
look I found some of the flames to look at a place and some of the billowing smoke looked oddly converted audio isn't you'll be Atmos for both the 4k and 3d versions and it's straight demo material right from the opening,0.18795161
you'll hear distinctly plays voices talking through different speakers there in front of you to the sides behind you and you'll even hear that little girl whisper right above your head don't forget how crisp that lizard sounds when it's running across the sand right before it gets stomped on the sandstorm is another demo worthy scene with whirling effects engulfing the entire listening space,0.3492008
but the car chases have excellent front to back panning with bad guys dropping from the above channels,0.19517964
when they're swinging on those poles,0.17811061
the roar of the engines has some crazy DB room shaking bass,0.34002224
and again that sandstorm is going to put a working on your subwoofers the sound stage is cinematically wide and spacious with an intense rockin soundtrack dialogue was fine for the most part although hearing max mumble can be kind of hard to make out if you can't fix what's broken,0.13823964
now when I originally reviewed this I gave the movie an 8.5 for audio,0.065685175
I've upgraded many parts to my home theater,0.072464906
so after we watching this I'm gonna have to give the audio on 9.9 this is a killer mix right from the get-go it's loud it's bombastic,0.24185072
it's got everything you'd want from a Dolby Atmos mix aggressive surrounds and aggressive high channel usage and bass just rocks if you've got a surround sound setup but I'm sure that you've probably already got this movie in your collection for video which I previously gave an 8 it's going to get bumped up to a 9.6,0.23559481
I think the increase in detail over the regular,0.05913598
blu-ray is a noticeable difference whether or not you like the way the HDR looks well there's no denying the color pops right off the screen,0.12721013
and those crazy highlights aren't quite the attention grabber for 3d video we're gonna go with the 9.8,0.4094069
I always forget this movie comes in 3d whenever I put it in for a quick look I always get stuck watching the entire thing,0.11783191
it's got some heavy 3d separation with a little flatness thrown in but overall for me personally,0.1817776
I think the added depth the bright 3-dimensional image and the rich color palette make this my preferred way to watch this movie,0.026746228
now no matter which way you like to watch Mad Max I think you'll find it is a complete audio and visual assault if it's not in your collection and you need something to show off your home theater system then you need to pick up this movie right,0.15126945
now,0.031218953
it's a must own,0.06964623
