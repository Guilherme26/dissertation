I'm DB it's in the top 250 I believe and yeah it's in Houston rotten,0.12468003
yeah 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and yeah it's just a very very loved film,0.068182655
and I first saw this in 2015 around that time when I you know first,0.02325349
watched Citizen Kane actually I kind of watch this in pretty very close proximity because,0.051250406
yeah just for awesome Welles really wowed me with Kane so I just I wanted,0.050266597
to watch this and I really could say that these two films actually other most,0.044382382
acclaimed ya see the most acclaimed overall films at Baltimore's Orson Welles is involved in,0.04195446
you know of course he didn't direct the film although that is actually controversial you,0.017940668
know some say I've said over the years it's kind of you know rumors that,0.039777983
he at least had a hand in some of the direction but certainly it's confirmed,0.031231703
that he did write along his own Alliance and basically a lot of the famous,0.025757242
the most famous lines from the film actually once he wrote but Graham Greene of,0.009415675
course was the main writer you know off the film and he actually wrote a,0.013868414
novella before this to prepare which is a really I think an idea that kind,0.037049398
of really makes sense to me to write a novella and then adapt it into,0.021393636
the script form I think that's kind of that's the most logical way really I,0.024516674
think it's always one I've always for you know of basically yeah this film you,0.06705584
know it's deserve a score as well it's very very famous of course the e,0.061592013
theme and just the theme music for our and Roger Ebert would say this is,0.024635741
one of the top ten films of all time at one point I believe and,0.02902795
yes I watched it and after Susan Cain of course which I absolutely love I,0.031873606
watched this I think and very closely and what I think this film is it,0.038098395
one of the best ones all time absolutely this is one of my absolute favorite,0.051740646
films a florist masterpiece and just perfect in its form in its tone you know,0.061928596
just everything about this film is mind blown one of the best fritters of all,0.12904164
time and awesome Welles is on fire in this film Joseph Cotten an absolutely wonderful,0.082392305
protagonist all performances out of alley Trevor Howard is just amazing in the film very,0.02193709
charming and the whole film has this charm yes about this Chandler's there and I,0.045710754
at the same time very very cynical and you know set in of course the,0.04831761
main plot which I won't get into too much you know it's basically Joseph Cotten,0.037827663
the beginning the film basically goes to Vienna it's post-world War two Vienna so it's,0.06918109
kind of war-torn country you know and all the buildings are different kind of element,0.06102927
destroyed half destroyed and of course there's loads of you know crime and poverty kind,0.37606326
of that's true and Joseph Cotten plays Holly Martin's who's basically a pope Western writer,0.011850246
so that's very very interesting I kind of loved films where it's always very interested,0.029199567
in you know when done well and the protagonist or someone is an actual writer,0.019447975
it kind of just you know is really interested in and when they actually kind,0.025857018
of discover things that are kind of play into the Conover stories they tell and,0.015386363
known for okay it worked perfectly here and he basically goes to Vienna because he's,0.053697616
told by Harry Lime who is basically he's played by Orson Welles in a film,0.028565647
and yes you know announcement now of course I'll just say now and I'll put,0.039418783
in the description possible spoilers because I can't really talk about film you know essentially,0.017541558
if you say awesome well is in the film and you know he's hairy like,0.042759337
you know some of them of course in fact that you know he's not dead,0.11374773
so there's a spoilers of course put warning in the description and yes it's I,0.06455807
suppose it's minor spoilers because how can you watch the film and know the lost,0.052815583
mothers in it and who plays and not expect him to be in there he,0.06458667
is in the film of course I didn't have to analysis very well but yeah,0.012664432
he's in the film and basically though it's believed at beginning that he is dead,0.08941332
and you know once shows of cotton you know arrives it's learned very very quickly,0.059743468
these dead and you know Harry Lime basically invited him in for a job he,0.22624972
offered him a job and basically yes Holly Martin's arrives and he's shocked and the,0.024124881
funeral he then basically things I'm right you know it doesn't seem right and you,0.20257303
know very very just mysterious the way happened and coincidental and just just not right,0.093701094
so he kind of starts to investigate and you know that many many different leads,0.017336681
and he follows one of the main ones being the cancer that out of Valley,0.07092387
plays and she basically she can't afford some but she was of course Harry limes,0.018090999
the lover and basically a very very complex relationship you've got this kind of triangle,0.17398211
going on unofficial triangle and yes basically it's basically yes Holly Martin's kind of discovering,0.14090252
or you know all the different clues and seeing you know different characters that were,0.011544262
involved with Harry Ron of course Anna of course who had a very plays it's,0.03349466
a big big big character there and that's she's the one that kind of adds,0.030884476
a lot of depth to this film and the relationships is all in a feather,0.038116354
from very complex and it's all kind of ties in Trevor Howard of course is,0.010698149
it is sergeant Calloway and he basically he has a very big pot rollin film,0.08900157
and he of course the gray masterful in the brief in the film brief encounter,0.034970034
good she's all mine absolutely loved and wonderful here I think he has so much,0.041121654
to the film just kind of the charm the kind of the comedy that comes,0.02914635
is a lot from him and yeah basically you could say it's a bit complex,0.08731267
on paper but the way it's told the plot it's very very clear storytelling and,0.032441672
it's never convoluted in front of that and it's just one of the most engaging,0.07336976
films I've ever seen and you know when I first saw it I was blown,0.07901916
away couldn't quite believe it it really did you know many had said is one,0.050199416
of the greatest problems I just kind of straight away I thought yes I agree,0.100942284
you know it's one of them films it's just so perfect you know in every,0.082379006
way subset the main plot and of course about 60 minutes in or after that,0.029560097
there is a massive reveal of course which I won't really get into too much,0.030186035
other than what a masterful review or one of the best in cinema and that,0.028481834
is just it's just such an amazing moment the time in the end the build-up,0.02145816
the atmosphere the little hints here and there the involvement of course of the cats,0.02843128
look out for that I can't afford shadow it and you know just the actual,0.021293193
reveal itself you know and the camera movements and the way that the music is,0.020384552
used is just perfect that is just one of the best you know kind of,0.015269291
most kind of worthy moments in cinema for me I absolutely love that moment I'm,0.047624487
just so good an opportunist boy and of course the film was just so perfect,0.12083527
you know it draws you in straightaway I believe on this release Carol Reed narrated,0.029620627
but I'm not too sure on that and there's two different versions Joseph Cotten and,0.013165315
Calvary I think it was Carol reading this one but yes basically Australia join in,0.030119516
and you know editor to perfection the way the plot unfolds in this film it's,0.040690616
just masterful storytelling it's just mr. I was one of them thrillers that the plot,0.049395874
it's not you know completely taken over the characters the characters you know in the,0.013821186
atmosphere the city and all this gun stuff and the kind of emotion behind it,0.10342142
the values and you know the kind of morals that you know kind of gets,0.046014745
into it's all in harmony perfectly with the actual plot you know it's not filmed,0.03080266
this completely you know completely dialogue-driven the visual storytelling of course is very prominent you,0.02318165
know and of course you've got the famous Dutch angles the very program in the,0.046773717
film and it's just perfect the way that kind of creates this uneasy atmosphere that's,0.04093673
kind of look to the film all the close-ups as well you know of the,0.027014438
kind of even the background characters really early on creates like an atmosphere you know,0.02698783
an uneasy feel you know things you just kind of think of us weird something's,0.0880324
not right and it's just for the visuals alone that is the direction and cinematography,0.03789817
is absolutely perfect in this film as well as just the lighting not just the,0.03772988
angles but the lighting is wonderful the zooms you know the you know the pushings,0.074121416
perfect the timing is key and it's perfect and of course adding to that you,0.017298765
know the actual River score it's just so perfect you know it's just Lester films,0.029909983
of flow and as forms of flows so wonderfully and it's just epic you know,0.038852047
just you know every time you know that kind of score comes on and you've,0.032007307
got the zooms that everything in addition the kind of plot points in the film,0.047592558
you know they kind of the notes the kind of perfectly fit into the intro,0.07428438
notes within the story it's just perfect it's just yeah just kind of give you,0.025332853
the shows at least it did for me and you know the characters in the,0.015428934
film you know I've actually got a film book that actually cites this you know,0.043386605
these characters the relationships dynamics you know in a way that it kind of it's,0.022645513
all part of this you know this circle it's all linked in and of course,0.02564017
you can study that and just really know how to tell a story level he,0.019839102
way the cancers or of rolling the story and the way of all kind of,0.030382263
they would have ripple effects you know and what they do in the film and,0.025575645
all the different you know prop ones and it's just so genius all the cancers,0.14690381
are so fully fleshed out even as well just the background characters and there's always,0.022120683
been some sort of comedy or just sense of dread as well at times and,0.050188106
you know it's just it's just so perfect you know I think the protagonist is,0.029872732
amazing it's gotten an amazing actor you know I'm not fan of him Heaven's Gate,0.06799773
but I'm a fan of most people in that film apart from Christopher Walken my,0.027495366
family film but really nice you know shadow of doubt is great in that Joseph,0.0188533
Cotten and Citizen Kane of course as well and of course it's great to see,0.035316594
you know Joseph Cotten an Orson Welles back together again after Citizen Kane you know,0.038770895
acting in the same film because they're just great to give you and I think,0.052090533
you know as well the actual the actual characters from they play you know Harry,0.008540293
Lime and of course Holly Martin's I think that the parent is great and the,0.03130088
dynamics you know kind of in the plays off the exposition is from you know,0.02187789
the backstory of you know how they were friends you know and they're younger and,0.03456028
just just the one that the exhibition is told for dialogue just adds so much,0.014348676
before the actual reveal happens and you kind of find out of course that Harry,0.04053762
lamb is not dead when they're together on screen it's just it's all the more,0.03569974
meaningful and just really massively complex relationship so much depth humanity to this from and,0.02600735
especially you know through this relationships and they have and the kind of the yeah,0.031663407
the backstory between a woman and the way that it kind of pans out as,0.16774268
well you know this film has got of course great comedy but it is also,0.04098662
sad at times and of course not meaty at least ER kind of thing and,0.06867622
I just think the dialogue was absolutely perfect in this film just you know all,0.03272903
the characters in Swan was just so good of course out of alley very very,0.016390124
complex and carrot sir and you know it's got some lifted moments between Aaron of,0.029132383
course Joseph Cotton's character but it has got its moving moments you know as well,0.01436331
and ones have really really touched you know touchy and I just think the way,0.16808127
it comes together at the end it's perfect you know I think of course the,0.04027288
end didn't was meant to be originally there's going to be a more happy ending,0.06057894
and you know if you probably anyway if you've seen some of my reviews you,0.05198743
know that I or maybe not I do Jenny for happy endings but it's great,0.040304143
when it director kind of writer goes for an ending where you know it is,0.0496972
more daring you could say and you know in relation to the rest of tone,0.024139514
in the film I think it is perfect really but yes it is very very,0.025874313
dark this film has got silikal moments and just fits perfectly to kind of the,0.020822909
locations of course well and the way is trying to portray post you know world,0.024459468
or to Vienna and as well just a whole seediness of it I miss portrayed,0.07630189
perfectly you know the atmosphere the tone just free through the visuals of course the,0.016092788
angles and everything the uneasy feel the use of them you know lighting shadows is,0.01486885
perfect you know it's just so good and of course that plays a massive you,0.030643014
know and any actual reveal itself and just it's just wonderful this film you know,0.04831894
the edge and as I've said is perfect and it kind of just this film,0.06139512
just gets better and better and it's just from start to finish one of the,0.04239814
most thrilling films I've ever seen the chase scenes you know it's just it is,0.045654215
perfect in this film he's ever scored by a hands-on class just perfect you know,0.08810358
perfectly suits the action in this film I couldn't think of a more perfect use,0.048043553
of music really for that just the way it builds and builds and it kind,0.03574431
of you know it kind of hard to explain that there's ever instrument of course,0.042984832
kind of it kind of the notes you know kind of sounds almost like tension,0.034163166
in itself and the way that you use them in the action the way you,0.039052267
know that as the you know tempo of the instrument builds so does um you,0.023502268
know works in harmony with the actual the action itself this is so genius you,0.023753043
know the way it builds in certain scenes the chase scenes are all just wonderfully,0.012448247
done and you know the finals of 10 minutes of the film just mind-blowing really,0.04917703
mixed emotions there you know so many emotions I felt but really at the end,0.031521056
of day just just constantly on the edge of my seat and caring about these,0.027477406
characters so much and that's you know great fillers it's not I can't just have,0.019478573
a great feel of really interesting plot you know I never because you never know,0.083174564
care about the characters and it's not Q manatee in the film it's not one,0.02977362
that kind of yeah these characters going along with this film unraveling the mystery behind,0.07268329
something then I'm not you know massively interested and there's never been a I further,0.041643158
really were you know it's not good characters in from but I love where you,0.06932478
could say from most films really in general but yeah I think this one just,0.03188957
perfectly balances out all the elements in that sense and the atmosphere through this film,0.051744636
there's almost a match I think it's just wonderful and so many things I felt,0.062056977
you know as I say the end it really you know the ferris wheel scene,0.1137484
as well of course while one of the best moments cinema probably for me just,0.022788526
amazing and everything leading up to that and then you just cover the way you,0.047619168
know awesome I'll just walks into the scene and of course the actual scene itself,0.07129438
you know which just really it's very contemplative put so many things into perspective and,0.08480825
it's kind of a clash of you know ideals and very shocking at times you,0.14126505
know what the approach you know this Harry lunch council you know what he reveals,0.01614201
initially actually tensions and he's really is the dark nature of his you know personality,0.04886439
and as well though it's just poetic the way is told and the way this,0.013068198
just shows all these people beneath you know the dots as I say and you,0.13632473
know in the relation to the plot now it does get dark you know the,0.026412448
enterprise so a very very shocking actually you know it involves of course penicillin and,0.023227548
stuff like that and racketeering of course which you shouldn't you soon you know find,0.18795562
out you know and really especially once of course a lot most comes into the,0.025712674
film you know there's many many you know reveals there but you know really really,0.01307485
dark and cynical but it really is just too complex for a human film and,0.11121937
in the end you know just just a masterpiece of a film perfect from start,0.033783346
to finish couldn't flora fauna flora because there's nothing wrong and just it goes way,0.05741067
beyond that though you know this is definitely of course if you if you kind,0.056441497
of push this review all of it you know that I love this film it's,0.08460338
being very theistic about it so of course it gets into my hundred percent plus,0.07084871
tears now it goes beyond the tear free actually manages to get 107 plus t2,0.05515237
easily and actually very very close to tier 1 this from you know I think,0.027163438
he's no it's not really comparison but Citizen Kane of course and god tier two,0.03989572
now this is ever so slightly below sis and came from me I prefer Kane,0.076400995
but you know I think both already almost in the level and you know both,0.012267982
are very close to tier 1 something both have something absolute finest from his all-time,0.032040566
you know it's just this film is just it's quite dark moments but it's guys,0.05657653
its comedy its width as charm and the perfect balance of that all the characters,0.04209016
just perfectly you know in terms of the way the design of the the actual,0.018750196
you know the circle the kind of the way it intertwines kind of thing and,0.03673277
you know be billed from the the slow kind of humble beginnings you know and,0.031668726
very very gradual mystery you know it's the kind of peaceful stuff which as I've,0.034825023
gotten you know it's kind of you know Holly Holly Martin's you know just ways,0.15637669
walking around discovering little things came there slowly injects this kind of atmosphere through the,0.051876344
angles perfect placement the least natural the light and friendly shadows and just the kind,0.083102055
of just the way the characters are talking this film you know very very dark,0.024037741
and somber times and as well just how relatable you know Polly Martin's is you,0.03737268
know it's a very very interesting I was a you know a pop western writer,0.044331163
it's kind of not that successful but then it kind of adds to comedy there,0.020108502
as well you know Bernard Lee's character there you know kind of all the scenes,0.028322855
there you know great comedy and this is one of the things just such a,0.017214287
funny film at times but it never goes over the top or anything it's all,0.04961871
very very restrained and kind of dry humor you could say and just the perfect,0.030988246
placement throughout the film of all of the humor but you know in terms of,0.01595576
direction the cinematography editing perfect really and this film just it moved me it just,0.044822734
thrilled me constantly the action is just wonderful some of the best action it's in,0.042965543
a more easily the score by a Karass is just perfect you know zipper score,0.14007437
really really it's beautiful and answers' con men and cornfields to film as well the,0.09255897
ways used especially in the action scenes and the kind of reveals could not be,0.014594129
more you know perfect for this film and just an absolutely flaws from from start,0.021957712
to finish and you know this is a screenplay in this film grain green of,0.026853465
course and of course awesome wells you know the kind of dialogue he added it,0.04004472
in that it's just so so meaningful but it just has such a flow that,0.014096572
script just an ease and combine that with just the ease of the direction you,0.021206055
know in this film by Cal read absolutely masterful direction just perfect and just the,0.025317555
one that yeah it's just all the way to the very end you know it's,0.06550595
just perfect for me I would say that this is as Citizen Kane is just,0.035719696
outside my top 100 films of all time so really lists this nest is absolutely,0.03755494
massive praise I would say it's very very close to my tier 1 and easily,0.032131694
yeah one of the best British films of all time you know there are better,0.03290597
ones definitely and you know it's been compared you know in British films to the,0.02006726
rights of brief encounter the Lawrence of Arabia I don't think it's as good as,0.037626777
in film so there's kind of hints for when I do my David Lean director,0.041655794
series how much I love him and his films especially Lawrence of Arabia yes but,0.04272408
definitely one of the best British films one of the best noir films just one,0.06304943
of the best films in cinema and highly recommend this film this is Studio canal,0.13665666
release and it's the steelbook recommend that just wonderful cinematic perfection and one of my,0.024999596
most loved films of all time so thanks watching my review of Cowell reads absolute,0.03677601
