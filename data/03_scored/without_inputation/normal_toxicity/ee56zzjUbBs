hi everybody my name is Steph Koza,0.07407127
and today I'm going to review the shape of water the shape of water is directed by Guillermo del Toro back at it again never disappoints,0.062436655
and the story is set in the 1960s where a young mute janitor named Eliza works in a research facility where she discovers this very strange peculiar mysterious aquatic creature,0.14934422
this movie had me hooked from the first trailer just the way that it looks the style,0.14177606
the very weird mysterious vibe that it has I knew that I wanted to see this movie I just instantly was like that looks awesome,0.1422074
and it's a little bit difficult to describe because it is very strange,0.10630432
but it's essentially like Bioshock Meets The Creature from the Black Lagoon which yes is very weird,0.2721756
but it makes for an amazing movie every shot looks very Bioshock like I love the feeling of Bioshock,0.242109
I love the way that it looks and it has that exact same vibe of the 60s very dark and gritty it's nighttime almost the entire movie because Elijah works the night shift,0.13473326
so it's dark with lots of cool tones lots of that like 1960s mint green teal color everywhere it has a very industrial feel and there's also a lot of water imagery because this creature is this weird like Creature from the Black Lagoon thing,0.26646075
it's just really cool to watch even if the plot was terrible it's a beautifully stunning movie,0.11185436
but thankfully the plot is far from the terrible this movie is a very strange,0.10903006
unexpected love story between Eliza this mute janitor and The Creature from the Black Lagoon,0.15249044
I think it's a little bit more than a love story,0.07072404
it's about much more than that it's about their connection rather than their romantic interest in Sally Hawkins performance as this very confident mute girl is absolutely amazing and very compelling,0.1496952
she doesn't say a word for the entire film,0.1464895
but you can understand her feelings and her emotions based on just her facial expressions in the way that she moves,0.26354495
I think this is probably my favorite performance from both Richard Jenkins,0.054762695
and Michael Shannon Shannon is this really malevolent villain who just is so evil like you just,0.74477243
I don't know something about him,0.21974054
you just love to hate him like just love it,0.64307165
and Jenkins is sort of like Eliza's best friend slash father figure who you just kind of want to give him a hug the entire time,0.123817556
Octavia Spencer is also fantastic as always she's amazing,0.12192303
and she is another janitor that Eliza works with she's kind of like her friend slash like caretaker almost and she's very sassy and I love it the movie toys with the idea of being an outcast and being an outsider where essentially everybody around you judges you,0.26782662
and I think that's a really relatable concept for almost everyone,0.03106578
it's a very relatable movie despite,0.08390801
its very strange plot lines because I think everyone has felt like an outsider at least some point in their life,0.15311515
but when you think about it it's not just the creature in this movie that's the outsider at first glance,0.15100612
yeah the creature is weird and everyone's like what is this thing,0.17232211
we need to do experiments on it,0.14910433
and test it and we can't have any involvement with it because it's this far away ostracized thing,0.13411593
but when you look at the movie a creature isn't the only outcast,0.19053103
we have janitors,0.062263362
we have a mute,0.15231284
we have an african-american woman,0.27969202
we have a homosexual man,0.49936217
we have a Russian guy who kind of just wants to be an American,0.12340168
and the fact that this movie is set in the 60s makes all of those characters incredibly more ostracized,0.07436925
but it turns into this beautiful unexpected love story between Eliza and the creature and it takes very bold and daring moves,0.1582921
there are a lot of scenes that I would have never expected the kind of toys with how far it can go and how weird it can get without really feeling that weird it almost feels like the plot of a old classic film,0.10104669
like girl falls in love with monster,0.5887685
it's very like King Kong that kind of thing,0.0829535
it's a very classic idea that hasn't really been brought to light recently but it also has a very modern twist and it does feel a little weird and a little off and there are a lot of moments where you're like,0.07098082
I don't even what's happening right,0.15836172
now this is very weird,0.16648206
but for some reason it feels right,0.06713661
and it doesn't feel as weird as it probably should,0.10074536
I don't know maybe,0.12577063
it's just me,0.059434067
maybe I just like weird movies but I really liked it I thought it was really cool,0.10378304
I thought it was a very unique movie it's been a while since I've seen a movie as unique as this one,0.09267861
and I loved the theme behind it,0.19470781
I loved all the messages,0.07729731
I loved all the acting all the visuals,0.111847915
everything about it was absolutely fantastic,0.092211865
because of that I'm going to give it a 4.5 out of 5,0.08964169
I'm knocking down at point five because there were parts that were a little weird and made me feel kind of uncomfortable,0.15336098
I haven't entirely processed,0.07750853
it yet maybe I'll change,0.064715825
my mind later there was just a little bit that I feel could have been turned around or I don't know,0.11046191
I don't know poor bum five out of five that's pretty good,0.46126515
I think that's okay,0.07657593
