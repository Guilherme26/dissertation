i get so sick of telling people in the comments i've seen it i've seen,0.22677624
it i've seen it i alternate between films where they're like funny jokes where they're,0.10895544
cheesy where like i can just sing along or laugh to then like jumping back,0.09085359
to something which is more critically acclaimed it should be interesting to revisit this i,0.05913496
remember that there's aliens and amy adams and jeremy renner and i think forrest whitaker,0.15328677
is in this too it's about language and trying to communicate with them but i,0.068421006
was discussing with someone about how i've seen it but i don't really remember anything,0.08813082
from it i don't remember everything i don't think so it's kind of a re-watch,0.08490325
but also i feel like i might be surprised by certain things possibly maybe we'll,0.038253702
see everyone's saying it in the comments all the time i just kind of got,0.052608263
sick of it so i thought why not just like re-watch it together because then,0.2704221
i can just say it's on my channel i can just like copy paste it,0.06224028
into the comments i've seen it it's on my channel it's on my channel stop,0.18169284
hassling me about it i feel like i should do more denis films like i've,0.18172516
i think i've seen all of his films except for incendi's yeah i guess let's,0.14684348
jump into this so i mentioned this on my twitter the other day i find,0.2387995
it so so funny i find it like actually hilarious when i read these comments,0.091717064
where people tell me stop talking you talk too much like just watch the movie,0.15193248
it's literally in the title it says movie commentary like this film goes for nearly,0.10168939
two hours this video will go for like 20 25 minutes i'm not talking throughout,0.15045097
the entire film you do realize that right majority of the time that i'm sitting,0.07943333
here i'm actually not speaking i'm literally watching the movie these are just like highlights,0.17109041
this is the portions of the movie that i'm talking at least majority of them,0.0917161
i don't know why i actually have to put that out there like if you,0.17674902
want to watch the movie with no one talking i don't know why you're watching,0.16846159
a movie commentary video i feel like putting the definition of commentary on the screen,0.0841003
right now [Applause] i used to think this was the beginning of your story on,0.049517367
the nature of daylight by matt uh max richard it's already playing it's already playing,0.0694549
this opening scene i don't i i'm gonna cry my tissue is sitting over there,0.13572812
in case i start crying imagine losing your child like your child when they're a,0.6364068
teenager or a baby or just it happens to so many people but it's just,0.20270881
that's so unfair now i'm not so sure i believe in beginnings and endings there,0.07189332
are days that define your story beyond your life like the day they arrived ends,0.13630451
in beginnings why am i getting dark vibes guys do we believe in an end,0.15252969
in the beginning where is everyone okay well let's get started literally for uni i,0.039828606
turn up for like the first lecture the next like three months i don't even,0.14878888
go to the lectures and if they're recorded which majority of them are i don't,0.09800069
usually listen to them that was me in uni i don't i'm not i don't,0.09815774
study anymore but that was me in uni that was pretty much me if they're,0.10078026
not compulsory then i wouldn't go to them do people not have their phones on,0.15996297
silent i always have my phone on silent who wants beeps and tones and stuff,0.09319686
coming off all the time it's so frustrating mom please don't bother with that channel,0.36579382
how many times do i have to tell you those people are idiots choose your,0.88560754
media sources wisely and correctly because there are so many people out there and like,0.07839109
news telecasts and journalists that just speak absolutely like total i love that she's sleeping,0.15354434
hugging a pillow that is so subtle like a way of showing me maybe that,0.12271439
she's lonely or missing like comfort and companionship you know a lot of people do,0.13386378
that with pillows like they want to be able to hold something or hug someone,0.110395595
there's like literally things that you can buy like like human size that you can,0.24665849
cuddle when you're sleeping the atf has put a temporary ban on new gun licenses,0.12019911
forcing many independent suppliers of hunting equipment and firearms to close their doors to the,0.09996435
public piss off firearms should not be your priority right now i can tell you,0.67219466
that it's impossible to translate from an audio file i would need to be there,0.061054576
to interact with them i feel like this was a whole new language that they,0.06967898
created right for this film that they like did this from scratch like made an,0.096846506
actual full language i could be making this up but i feel like that's a,0.061353166
thing oh jeremy renner he's the map oh i just kicked the camera my bad,0.5154597
i like jeremy right now when he's put in good roles he's really good like,0.1367473
he's actually a really good actor he made me cry in endgame he made me,0.25896263
cry given good movies i am down for that how about we just talk to,0.101757035
them before we start throwing math problems at them this is why you're both here,0.37816986
opposites working together i like that the importance is trying to find common ground common,0.09167804
ground between opposites you're not going to get anywhere unless you have the opposite ends,0.16870724
of the spectrum to work together that's just general knowledge people where do you expect,0.080617905
us to get anywhere if people don't work together we're going to get all done,0.16911033
zero productivity dude like come on come on that aerial shot that swooping aerial shot,0.48968306
is just denise that looks like miniatures that literally they look like miniatures does that,0.09946402
look like not look like a miniature set to you guys because it does to,0.16538288
me i love that like 360 swooping around i love that that's amazing put these,0.08725713
on you're going to wear them at all times that um military guy that was,0.11184095
there before he's the decade from ready or not he's the husband from ready or,0.08605852
not oh my god that movie if you haven't checked out my commentary for that,0.08701456
that was eventful that was an eventful commentary and very entertaining the use of the,0.065006815
orange is so just like kind of finding it hard today to articulate my words,0.13592316
i don't know why but the orange just makes them stand out so much in,0.12717447
regards to how cool toned the rest of the scenery is the entire um color,0.11062663
scheme is so dull so i love that they're in orange suits i love that,0.31089434
you know what that reminds me of it reminds me of like a contact lens,0.06482262
not that i have contact lenses but it looks like a disc kind of like,0.15094922
an eye like a not a puke like a pupil i don't know i don't,0.37204406
know is that giving you um 2001 as face odyssey sort of vibes that shot,0.4614474
i haven't seen that movie i know i know i know what is wrong with,0.071279906
me guys huh i feel like i'm gonna like look at this movie and be,0.10963215
like i like that shot that shot is gorgeous do you like that shot because,0.61670643
i like that shot that looks beautiful who loves this sound design in this school,0.46269196
huh who's on the same page as me let's turn this volume up guys obviously,0.15962984
they need to use animals to be able to tell if they're safe they're not,0.092990436
going to use humans obviously still poor birdie what if the birdie died i don't,0.32288435
want the birdie to die the tension of this movie my ears are in heaven,0.5208996
right now after this i am so watching behind the scenes videos guys i need,0.094489545
to know how this was bloody made what they used to make the sound of,0.5346773
them how they made the language the special effects the design my brain needs to,0.11233712
know how this happened how this worked their website claims the arrival of the aliens,0.11119322
set in motion a prophecy the 12 sets of 12 should be followed this kind,0.12097018
of thing just brings on the bloody maniac people that are just believe in absolute,0.74485815
total the minority are so much more vocal than the silent majority i'd be shaking,0.1214329
i wouldn't be able to deal i would not be able to deal if i,0.1441559
was her no way would i last i would majorly fail as my position as,0.12978022
her i'd be like nope not gonna happen amazing amazing it's like squid ink but,0.24111643
like smoky like squid that is so cool that's incredible yes it is incredible wow,0.11954808
oh special effects amy adams is amazing she's such a great actress she's in so,0.27648586
many roles like so many roles and i just adore her and her eyes are,0.11137756
so blue she has the most blue eyes contamination they need to see me back,0.11819588
doctor she's walking towards the screen i don't i don't think you're really going to,0.118432604
be able to convince her otherwise just let her do her thing if she dies,0.5154597
that's on herself that's her own that's her own fault oh my god that sh,0.47256207
oh wow oh oh god the goddamn oh the texture on there like skin so,0.794439
detailed ew that's actually kind of gross it's actually kind of gross ew louise i,0.45486918
am louise screw it just take it off imagine if they just died just like,0.6133191
bam dead dead on the spot they have names what are we going to call,0.5336429
them bob and jeff well that was totally off book oh but he's not happy,0.2157024
ready or not guy is not happy he doesn't seem very pleased looks like a,0.2695836
giraffe what is that horse why did i say giraffe looks like a giraffe here,0.30232412
are some of the many things we don't know about heptapods greek hepta seven pod,0.14905141
foot seven feet heptapod i think that exposition exposition each scene was very much needed,0.15369114
subtle and it wasn't just like info dump dump which was good it was like,0.15543295
providing us with knowledge that we need just to sort of recap you know how,0.074579544
exposition scenes can be like that where they're just like damn here is all your,0.7093121
information that you need damn the same government who ruined our healthcare and bankrupted our,0.7120844
military look at these people most of them don't even have guns who needs roof,0.40363494
guns are not the solution oh she's hugging her daughter like she was hugging her,0.31089434
pillow oh how sad i don't think that that makes me unfit to do this,0.15395688
job the one thing that's really stood out to me so far is the lighting,0.10193069
like i feel like we haven't really gotten many harsh contrasts in the lighting it's,0.07671514
very soft and luminous really like that i just i love the way that lighting,0.10977776
is used in this movie our language like a culture is messy and sometimes one,0.15068536
can be both and it's quite possible that they're asking us to offer them something,0.036490627
not the other way around you go to google translate and write in a word,0.11096184
for like a certain language for it to be translated into another language it can,0.07759478
be something completely different this is absolutely frustrating off off i already have like a,0.15307893
passionate hate for him already all people want is to kill other people and create,0.73933184
hate and war in the world i know you have to be safe and protect,0.44815484
your borders and protect your country but that's not going to get us anywhere no,0.13292915
don't disconnect from australia no no we need to be talking to each other we,0.12488563
want to talk exactly communication i can't believe they explode they try and send off,0.116774805
a bomb a bomb you pieces of you're all piece of this you i can't,0.80410194
belie actually no that's not far-fetched that's honestly not ridiculous like that's not something that,0.5567725
wouldn't happen like obviously that's gonna happen we've been attempting to hail captain marks the,0.108979106
escort units are not responding sir why not said security the escort units aren't responding,0.05051257
it's because they're murderers they're murderers i get angry but i just i don't want,0.47816566
to deal with hateful people i don't knock knock who's there so what they're gonna,0.43002862
kill other humans so they can kill the two heptapods so they can kill albert,0.7702318
and costello they're going to kill other humans other military people who are probably their,0.68034613
friends people they work with that has no logic that has no no logic i,0.15101968
don't know which one it was but they protected them he protected them and saved,0.09000832
them oh my god they are not harmful to humankind they're not said the aliens,0.24433608
have 24 hours to leave chinese territory or face destruction and he urged all other,0.4385883
world leaders to unite with china and take a similar stance no no no it's,0.116380155
a non-zero sum game non-zero sum game what the have i forgotten about this movie,0.09860605
like they're giving have given her powers this is so frustrating me oh can she,0.18491293
see oh she can see future events she can see oh oh my god it's,0.08753983
coming back to me it's coming back to me now okay okay my i i,0.15971375
remember i kind of remember the ending i kind of remember the ending now yes,0.12772721
yes yes yes hop in get in there i don't know how i feel about,0.13581331
the hair how do you guys feel about the hair do you think it looks,0.082936466
good i think it looks good but a little something doesn't feel right oh it's,0.108567424
so much bigger than they thought has it got a head oh my god oh,0.15361305
that shot oh my god that's so cool how can you know the future because,0.2384512
we're aliens that's how we do the future because we're aliens from out of space,0.19048475
mommy and daddy talk to animals oh my god yes the bird oh okay okay,0.31089434
now it's all clicking imagine being able to see the future i think all of,0.05039949
it's coming back to me so the technology that they gave her technology or weapon,0.26083347
in their language because obviously they're still struggling to communicate the weapon is being able,0.083750576
to open time and so all these flashbacks are actually her seeing the future of,0.06399997
her daughter her daughter's future and mommy and daddy mummy daddy see the future jeremy,0.4157282
rena is her husband and they have the child but then they get a force,0.13676196
okay okay yeah yep i told him something that he wasn't ready to hear what,0.2100474
that you're dead that you're going to die that you're oh that's so sad honey,0.7310397
your daddy didn't leave you you're going to see him this weekend he doesn't look,0.31208327
at me the same way anymore of course he doesn't she told him that she,0.108942114
dies i just realized why my husband loved me are you remarried not past tense,0.4555336
future tense future tense i will be married well your name is very special because,0.09978342
it is palindrome it reads the same forward and backward because at the beginning she,0.1510971
said when it comes to time we don't know if when there is the ending,0.1162342
when there is the beginning because she's open with time now like time is open,0.074132316
so so you can see what's to come the time it it isn't the same,0.06360314
for them it's non-linear i love how she's saying like the language is non-linear because,0.11267493
when you think linear you think like straight you know start and end but they're,0.31089434
the way that it's visually representated is like a circle it's round like i just,0.17807099
find that so interesting how visually the language reflects the concept and idea of how,0.046138905
the language actually works the design of it the design just like that blows my,0.23991662
mind it was an honor to work with good luck good luck having a child,0.12439707
that eventually will pass away and my husband will leave me because i tell him,0.1099202
that our daughter dies from a rare disease and had her anyway because i wanted,0.54506785
to have her but also that's so difficult that's so difficult of a choice you're,0.10132088
the reason for this unification all because you reached out to me on my private,0.26042598
number how do people come up with these things like writers filmmakers just uh astound,0.06553211
me you're quite sure who i you are committing an act of treason yeah to,0.20944253
save the entire world you save the entire world imagine if like stuff that happens,0.105322994
in sci-fi films is real could you imagine like close encounters like what's the one,0.18604268
with jodie foster i s contact like insane imagine if we had all of these,0.17878246
abilities and all these things we're capable of these things and we're flashing back to,0.05701654
the beginning of the movie the beginning is the end the end is the beginning,0.065706104
i love that concept so much it just messes with your brain i love them,0.39460525
together they are i love their chemistry they're amazing daddy oh i'm tearing up oh,0.11098637
i wasn't meeting them is meeting you i'm such a crybaby music makes me so,0.54178286
emotional i cry so much in movies this movie wow incredible why did i get,0.10015683
it so get me so emotional that ending on the nature of daylight is it,0.1031135
has its own section in the credits yes that song just has its own tiny,0.10470787
little section in those credits it just helped i re-watched my favorite films over and,0.07992689
over again so many times but i never re-watch this what is wrong with me,0.15205392
thinking back on it now they foreshadowed a lot of different things like the part,0.09895267
where she said go ask your father because he's the scientist like that's hinting at,0.1232157
how ian is her father because he's the mathematician it's kind of therapeutic sitting down,0.26938298
and talking to you guys going through like all the recurring events in this movie,0.077720344
letting it come back to me sink in understanding it i want to know was,0.14316002
this nominated for stuff was this nominated for best picture winner of sound editing yes,0.06437732
so happy with that but it was nominated for best picture achievement and directing so,0.028742434
director adapted screenplay was nominated for cinematography film editing sound mixing production design oh my,0.08025984
god it was like nominated for everything denis you are a genius you are a,0.08328673
genius sean levy sean levy why is its name sound familiar oh my god he's,0.1170882
a producer for stranger things he's canadian too oh so he was a producer how,0.101860456
many produce 14 producers holy i'm so happy i rewatched it on my channel with,0.087824844
you guys because i wasn't even planning on it on doing this but i definitely,0.18646422
got a new perspective and experience on this film okay well let me know your,0.1207249
thoughts on arrival if it's your favorite denis film what you enjoyed about it if,0.07982543
you didn't like it that's your opinion everyone's allowed to love or hate whatever movies,0.37125862
they like i knew at some point i was gonna cry because i i usually,0.10331319
majority of the time cry at some point in a movie i hope you guys,0.20370552
