one last time hey guys the last critic guy into Dana March third is a very very monumental day,0.13230436
"why you may ask what for two major reasons first this video you're watching right now is my 1,000th video yes",0.094278835
thank you,0.039406788
thank you,0.039406788
thank you,0.039406788
so much,0.053568434
I never thought I would ever reach this milestone,0.15310968
but hey here we are,0.033924058
"and thank you guys for sticking with me for 1,000 videos",0.24392043
it must have been really painful,0.24012542
and the second reason is I am reviewing the last film to star Hugh Jackman as Wolverine called Logan,0.08289542
now Logan begins many years into the future where the mutant population has dwindled due to no new mutant births and possible mutant hunting we've all much older and weaker Wolverine who works as a limo driver in order to make some money to care for a sick and senile Xavier to a series of circumstances,0.42777127
he encounters a young girl who is like him in many ways and now must protect her from an evil organization that wants to experiment on her and bring her to a safe haven up north slicing enemies along the way now i mentioned earlier this ends the file film 2 stars Hugh Jackman as the titular and iconic character Logan aka Wolverine,0.24685313
it's also the final appearance of passive Stewart as Professor Xavier as he too stated that he's going to be retiring from the role after this film,0.10597199
so Logan is basically an end of an arrow type film as we have seen these two portrayed these characters for close to 20 years and now it's all come to an end,0.08917075
so there was no way that I was missing out on seeing Logan,0.061724264
I grew up with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and I will be there for his last film and I was super excited,0.114476025
the trailers are freaking awesome,0.27501312
it's freakin rated R which got me really excited,0.69542736
so we could see some really intense who are some a gritty action from Wolverine the type of action,0.093130074
we've always wanted to see,0.044570014
so I could not wait to see Logan and after watching the film what did I think about it,0.069786355
well let's get into it,0.11793352
shall,0.051348176
we first thing worth mentioning about Logan was its action,0.08284973
this is without a doubt the most gruesome action,0.28643483
I have ever seen in a Wolverine film and it's exactly the kind of action,0.077806436
we all have been waiting to see in a Wolverine film,0.15921356
you guys,0.07067382
remember that one spectacular action sequence in Xmen apocalypse,0.06845603
we're Wolverine is mowing down guys left to right,0.1514927
we'll take that one scene from x-men apocalypse and extend it by two hours,0.1387046
that's the sort of high-octane action,0.07204307
you get to witness in Logan it's exhilarating bloody and also fun to watch with so many awesome and gratifying kills,0.6626736
I mean you got head piercings limbs flying everywhere blood spewing all over the place,0.6050138
it's just over-the-top action,0.060930293
goodness the acting is tremendous especially Hugh Jackman as Logan aka Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier no surprise there,0.13851206
this was honestly the most challenging and riveting performance I've seen Hugh Jackman give as the character Logan /,0.03271725
Wolverine and he has to portray a much older weaker and vulnerable Logan while still maintaining the reluctant hero persona as well as a sinister ferocity and in my opinion he pulled it off perfectly and I expect no less,0.1822585
it was a near-perfect swan song for a character that has been his for 17 years and I will miss him dearly after this film Patrick,0.12980655
Stewart's also try something new with his portrayal of Charles Xavier a more new approach to the character,0.05950789
it says of the smart reasonable and collected professor figure that we have known in love for many years TC now mentally unstable and crass,0.32105917
it was quite jarring to see to say the least,0.076232225
I mean the once great Professor X brought down to a doddering old fool my heart did break but it made for one of the most memorable and emotional heart-wrenching performances in the entire film that is just neck-and-neck with Hugh Jackman's performance and a little girl that plays Laura was pretty good too a feisty little one she is you do not want to get on her bad side ever and it to go without saying that the actors as well as the characters that they play has convincing and dynamic chemistry with Logan and Charles being the strongest no surprise there,0.43706977
I mean these two have been in almost every single x-men film together the story here is solid and engaging for the most part many high points,0.08066828
many low points,0.08083414
I enjoyed the journey aspects of the story there's a lot of great emotional things a lot of kick-ass action scenes,0.4463128
it's a well told well structured and enthralling story and it had a very Western vibe to it throughout the entire film which makes sense given,0.055766523
what type of story is and also a very very very fitting ending for a story like this and lastly all the technical aspects ranging from cinematography visual effects sounds and all that jazz were well done,0.04743683
so it seems as though Logan was the perfect send-off for Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine character,0.13468422
now we can ride triumphantly to the sunset right right right,0.14071801
well actually I do have a couple issues with the film Logan and I feel like many of you have your Wolverine claws shooting out of your fists like what how could you find anything wrong,0.35540292
this movie this movie's an edge of masterpiece Tony,0.11726135
when you're talking about your nonsubscribers just like this video all you're a terrible person calm down,0.7417051
listen to what I have to say,0.11092932
and remember that overall,0.04130043
I love this film it's a really really really enjoyable film but it is not without its flaws,0.1403278
my biggest problem with this film was that there was way too much,0.11097188
downside that ruins the overall flow of the pacing,0.15645874
now look I completely understand that these downside moments are meant to give the audience some time with the characters as well as a break from the action scenes,0.080654725
but some of these Delta moments stretch on for far too long like the first act with Logan Charles in this one mutant named Caliban living together in an abandoned smelting plant others just don't really add much to the characters that they really explore or develop these characters in these outside moments like a hotel scene with Charles Logan and Laura and then others were completely ineffectual and superfluous to the entire story like that entire segment were Logan Charles and Laura spend the night at farming families house what was the point of having that effect that entire scene felt eerily similar to the scene and x-men origins Wolverine hoovering say that mom potheads farming house and they end up buying the dust a multitude of these scenes could have easily been trimmed or completely removed,0.0740492
they didn't need to be in the film the main antagonists work really that memorable,0.070963606
nor were they all that threatening not to mention that they're just the same recycled evil corporation experimenting on mutants that we have seen of by the time and other x-men / wolverine films but I will give some credit to that one villain who constantly wore shades in the film and had that metal hand he has a flair of coolness to look that made him pretty,0.16579892
interesting but as the film went on he was just relegated to mere henchman status boom and the last major problem I found with Logan was I wish they gave us more bonding moments between Logan and Laura and sure the film does give,0.050907787
us a handful that were serviceable but not in the truly drive home that they built a strong deep and powerful connection throughout the entire film it was lacking to say the,0.056185897
least now the next few points are just mere nitpicks they're not cons against the,0.24003685
film they don't detract from the,0.07743524
film but they did personally irritate me throughout one of the biggest ones is I wanted more explanation as to what happened to the other,0.10706488
x-men now it's,0.14486839
heavily,0.051708274
implied that Charles had something to do with it,0.060320072
but never explicitly told to us and I personally believe that at this point it would be nice to kind of get an explicit explanation as to what happened to all of our favorite x-men where are they are they still around it,0.07949964
they could have explained a little bit more of that another significant and this is risk coming for me was the constant cussing throughout the film now far be it for me to complain that a film has too much cussing in it,0.27311283
I mean I cuss way more than I should in my own videos,0.3868871
and look I don't have a problem with excessive cursing in a film in fact I prefer it and thoroughly enjoy it as long as it comes off natural,0.37132028
the problem here in Logan is that many of these scenes are laced with profanity come off as super force like they just have to throw in a and a kid here because they got an R rating which I'm grateful for I'm thankful that you finally gave us a or rated Wolverine film as they gave us,0.10238439
some of the best action we've ever seen a Wolverine film but just because you're all rated doesn't mean that you have to cut every three to five seconds I mean as long as you do it now and again that's perfectly fine,0.08149463
in fact it would be more effective,0.05804138
also hearing Patrick Stewart's version of Charles Xavier cursing so much was just so weird and unsettling now Logan I understand as he's always been a character that's known to fly off the hinges,0.33956048
you know go off the handle but with Xavier,0.103231795
I always saw him as a man of intelligence integrity and elegance who wouldn't stoop to using such a vulgar,0.5929729
and petty speech so to hear him cursing so much in this film I didn't know how to feel,0.5734896
I was kind of taken aback like oh not not not wrong,0.07645078
Xavier does all the characters that should never cut in my presence,0.15716219
it's Charles Xavier,0.07063439
I don't like seeing Charles cussing so much and look I understand that it fits the type of character that he is in this film as he is losing his mind,0.45899597
he is senile,0.5154597
so of course he's more prone to these petty outbursts but that doesn't mean it changes how I feel about it,0.19430006
I still can't see Charles Xavier cursing but overall guys despite a few problems,0.4336329
I still found Logan to be a super film that I thoroughly enjoyed watching from beginning to end,0.10189675
it is my second favorite Wolverine film after the Wolverine and I thought it was an excellent send-off to an iconic character and an iconic role portrayed by Hugh Jackman and he will sorely be missed,0.08323386
but I am very thankful that for his last film as Wolverine he made it one hell of a film that I highly recommend that you all go see in fact I'll even need to tell you guys to go see it because you already have seen it or bored to see it regardless of what I think but as always guys,0.15168613
I'm not the end-all be-all appear when it comes to Logan,0.09871006
I would love to know what you guys saw about the show as well did you absolutely adore,0.13628916
it is it your favorite Wolverine film it's the best superhero film you've ever seen we're finally boring and slow and you really couldn't get into it and let me know what is the best performance Hugh Jackman has ever given as Wolverine in European,0.21466571
