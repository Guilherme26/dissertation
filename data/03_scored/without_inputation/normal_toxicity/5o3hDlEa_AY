things about roma Roma is epic it is a gigantic and majestic film and it,0.09744421
has to be seen in the cinema this thumb was shot on the digital equivalent,0.14878905
of 70 millimeter film which is just incredibly wide and big and just epic and,0.11034389
watching Roma was really an epic and awesome experience cinema graphically this film had some,0.05492827
beautiful and captivating moments due to the epic scope of the shooting format some bits,0.3696696
were really beautiful and captivating in terms of staging and Scimitar fee and direction they,0.050187312
were really awesome like this party scene in particular and another scene in the fields,0.049054578
where the camera is panning some shots were very very beautiful but not old alfonso,0.36007422
cuar√≥n shot this film himself and the cinematography at certain parts was really beautiful as,0.2419216
i just mentioned but it's mainly panning shots or static shots and it's really no,0.11997721
Lubezki cinematography so the cinematography isn't particularly incredible or innovative as Lubezki would shoot but,0.24131227
some bits were really powerful and really beautiful apart from the epic nature of the,0.14999765
film itself the other best thing about this film is the sound work there's this,0.078219585
one scene that happens in the ocean where the audience is just fully captivated and,0.088582955
taken over by the incredible sound work of the waves and of the sea which,0.06454436
makes that moment such a real and visceral and scary experience really really amazing sound,0.0802037
work roma is not entirely an autobiographical film the film is based on Afonso Korins,0.041366737
childhood memories of Mexico City in 1970 and 71 and Fonzo had every last detail,0.022981966
reconstructed to as it actually was in those years however there is one moment I,0.050596822
think it's the hospital moment but I'm not quite sure that apparently is actually um,0.07256911
a digital special effect it wasn't actually built so it was digitally reconstructed but everything,0.059938055
else is apparently real and actually reconstructed too as it was at that time Romo,0.066080205
isn't fully an autobiographical film because although there are scenes with supposedly young Alfonso Cuaron,0.09423691
but no child in this family is actually called Alfonso so we just have to,0.07541386
assume that one of the children is Alfonso so there aren't many scenes with a,0.089605615
young Alfonso however the film's plot is really about the indian Servant of Alfonso's family,0.098053545
and most of the film is about her story so because Romo is mainly about,0.07150499
the story of this Indian servant except for Cleo which is her name we don't,0.17169224
really connect that well to the rest of the family and it's really only Cleo,0.073543794
who I actually connected with the other characters I sort of observed them from a,0.0595287
distance really so my main problem I had with Romo is that the film itself,0.084026694
is not that interesting I mean it does captivate you and you want to keep,0.18151045
watching but just the story is not the most interesting ever but some bits cinema,0.104886785
too graphically or narrative Lee were really powerful especially at the end it's really powerful,0.06641597
but overall as a full product it's not that interesting of a film to watch,0.10641207
in my opinion one of the biggest faults of Romo was that it was shot,0.22363234
digitally Romo which is all based on memories should have been shot on film to,0.16440292
have that warmth and that vintage magic feel which the film completely needed and it,0.019196765
being digital it just felt cold had it been shot on film Romo would have,0.11029673
been a completely different and breathtakingly beautiful experience the Russian critic Anton Dolan compared this,0.05745511
film to amarcord and said that it's as good as a Marc Ord for me,0.09327477
that is not so where Mr cord is fully perfect and brilliant in every way,0.069170065
in every shot in every scene Roma is really not like that Roma is just,0.1977958
a film that contains great moments but overall is not that amazing so Roma has,0.100884385
no time our court or even no murmur of the heart and no the squid,0.15117858
and the Whale however it is closer to Louis Malle's aurevoir Ellis on phone in,0.055238992
terms of power those movies are quite similar so in my personal opinion Roma is,0.06576654
not Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece his masterpiece remains children of men which is just absolutely perfect,0.25738767
in every way and one of the greatest things that the cinema has ever given,0.055140134
us so overall Roma is a great and epic product and a really interesting time,0.039397698
capsule of Mexico City in 1970 and 71 thank you for watching and see you,0.06820519
