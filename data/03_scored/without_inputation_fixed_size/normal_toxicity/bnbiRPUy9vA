review that I am probably one of the few people in the world that thought,0.09802766
kylo Ren was freaking awesome in this movie alright I know a lot of people,0.3310342
like to say he's just a big cry-baby well he is and that's kind of,0.5698808
what I like about him because a lot of times we get these villains that,0.25421444
are you know you can maybe relate to something bad that happened in their past,0.057643943
that made them this horrible human today but with kylo Ren he literally feels so,0.5884578
relatable like I feel like we've all had that moment in our lives whether we,0.15035245
were kids or teenagers or adults we're you know we we were just so angsty,0.15165493
and stubborn and mad at the world like we've all been there so I really,0.16026206
like seeing that represented in a film and honestly I like that about kylo Ren,0.07689521
I wanted more scenes with him and Rey I loved every single scene everytime it,0.16634887
cut away from when they were chatting with each other I was like no go,0.15743358
back I want more of that I want to I want to know more like,0.058617085
there was this weird connection or chemistry that they had I loved that they didn't,0.058504388
go all like romance with it because it so I really liked their scenes together,0.12836659
and how they were basically talking about the exact same things just coming from two,0.05388958
different sides one being a dark side and one being a light side even though,0.07086623
they both have both qualities in them like it just was really interesting for them,0.15508938
to be talking to each other and kind of relating with each other and in,0.08038519
later on kylo actually saving Ray's life which was incredible like usually I'm really good,0.08979314
at predicting these moments but when I saw that lightsaber moving I'm like ooh Ray's,0.084772415
gonna like unleash some crazy sort she's gonna go like Wonder Woman everywhere but no,0.51988775
that was awesome I was not expecting that moment with kylo Ren saving her so,0.10794751
that was that was something that was really really cool that I thoroughly enjoyed and,0.054048188
then watching them fight together oh my gosh their fight sequence together was probably my,0.17174654
favorite part of the whole movie I'm not gonna lie just the the production value,0.15093043
of that moment with like all the men in red and just the atmosphere of,0.15074393
where they were and the actual choreography of the fight sequences like it just was,0.07909826
outstanding I loved that I can't wait to go watch it again because that moment,0.09476238
for me I was just sitting there like eyes wide mouth open I'm just like,0.21436556
oh my gosh I thoroughly liked Ray's journey throughout this movie especially with Luke Skywalker,0.13540748
and how they just they were able to make these really really funny moments within,0.08226202
such a serious world and a serious thing happening I felt like the story felt,0.07343721
very contained which was awesome it was literally like just saved the rebels from being,0.11883634
extinct and that was just your a2b but there was so much that happened in,0.24697082
the middle of these tiny little plot points like C and D and E plot,0.36000514
points between a and B that I just thought were so smart and I absolutely,0.08293735
loved it and it just made the movie feels so action-packed and entertaining and there,0.048593868
was just constantly something going on which I loved I really liked that Luke Skywalker,0.06381686
was kind of like this hard-ass at the beginning like he really was um he,0.8259263
still is I mean let's let's face it he's like grumpy old man Luke Skywalker,0.6635215
but I really liked that because you had this like young and courageous full of,0.13177854
hope ray versus like the old man like it just was fun and I liked,0.31089434
their dynamic a lot I don't know about you but those pores are like so,0.23961234
cute they were funny and adorable and sad and I want them all and they,0.15954585
I just absolutely loved them I love the addition of new creatures into the Star,0.067218296
Wars world I really enjoyed Poe's storyline throughout this movie I they just they just,0.050144106
did such a good job giving every single character a full arc and a full,0.05207408
purpose like we've been seeing so many movies this year that have huge ensemble cast,0.070472404
and we're just getting like tiny little bits here there of like even even a,0.24290398
huge character just being like butt of all the jokes but in Star Wars they,0.42950618
had an ensemble cast of characters who had full stories to complete in this movie,0.059539597
which I loved and for Poe it was basically him being kind of like a,0.06775642
little bit of a hothead and I just I'm gonna run in there and I'm,0.69542736
gonna blow things up into actually becoming a little bit more strategic of a leader,0.36213568
that he definitely could be and so watching his journey especially going against Authority and,0.10203326
then kind of learning that maybe he should do a little more listening even though,0.07034286
you know his hearts in the right place I just I loved his storyline we,0.07073853
had a new character Rose played by Kelly Marie Tran holy moley oh my gosh,0.2016861
you guys I don't know about you but I absolutely loved her absolutely loved her,0.15353629
I thought she was such an incredible addition to the story and made for such,0.054919764
an awesome duo with Finn I can't even believe that a movie that was you,0.19147554
know two hours and some on change could have so many things happen for different,0.067335784
characters in just one movie the action sequences were so incredible especially the final action,0.052544728
sequence with the salt and how it was like red contrasted with white I absolutely,0.12521274
thought that was genius because it gave us a practical reason to have like a,0.059419792
red sky you know we've seen some other movies where it's just all CGI and,0.07351125
the skies are just so red or orange and you're like well why and at,0.09123172
least in this movie we had a reason it was the salt and every time,0.06762541
they moved the salt red would come up from it and it just created this,0.1020407
incredible element to the film and it was beautiful to watch and definitely add its,0.027157446
dynamic and depth to everything I don't know about you guys but when I saw,0.119357765
Oda pop in I lost it I think the whole crowd was cheering we were,0.1100889
just not expecting Yoda to be in this movie at all but I really like,0.05605762
I liked Luke's journey and how Yoda fit into that and it and it kind,0.072848916
of just came full circle I'm not sure if he's gonna come back or not,0.10605441
I kind of hope he does because he was obviously very helpful and I don't,0.114070065
feel that his relationship with kylo has been a hundred percent resolved yet so I'm,0.069537915
kind of hoping Luke comes back for that oh my gosh Carrie Fisher watching her,0.13180512
was just heartbreaking she just looked absolutely stunning just stunning and she just her character,0.13452855
got to do some incredible things in this movie and she played such an important,0.10967307
role it's just heartbreaking to watch knowing that she's no longer with us but to,0.09351707
watch her shine in this movie was just it I don't know it made me,0.19003877
sad but in a happy way if that makes sense she just was so incredible,0.082953304
in this movie and I it just it was beautiful and holy moly Lane's got,0.08521812
the force oh my god another moment where I was freaking out and screaming I,0.24243231
was just like what what what but after all these years how wait can we,0.053239144
go back like can we just like get a little like flash back or something,0.11040195
like how how did this happen for the first time is this a new thing,0.06158876
has she had it this whole time and none of us have realized this this,0.08465465
might be really deep of a question and it probably might be in a book,0.056126725
somewhere but um yeah was that a shocker for you guys it was this something,0.116517
that you expected is it something you didn't like cuz I was all about it,0.12503417
I was like yeah that makes sense I've always wondered why Luke had the force,0.05916464
and she didn't so heck yeah and I know I'm probably like forgetting to talk,0.25213724
about a million things just because there's so much that happened in this movie and,0.078036994
so much of it that I liked between the action the acting the production value,0.11592652
