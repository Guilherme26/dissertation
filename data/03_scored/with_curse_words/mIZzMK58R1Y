[Applause] yo what's up team I am back in the building let's go ahead and,0.124873534
dive right into the spoiler free review of Marvel's Avengers endgame let's talk story let's,0.117794804
talk script story I thought the story was very creative we have a 22 film,0.06804056
build up and this is a final act and they were able to make that,0.056126647
into a three hours story I thought that was tight however I felt it was,0.07813873
very messy because when you think about it you have a ten year plus build-up,0.14903356
right 22 films and you come with a messy but creative story yeah I'm in,0.15475912
the middle with the story let's talk about script keep it one hunting with you,0.1360516
guys I gotta keep it real I gotta keep it that that's me this was,0.114272416
one of the worst MCU superhero scripts I've ever seen this script had problems major,0.28580344
problems let's break it down this script had no character development the script was not,0.088150464
designed for newcomers the script required you to watch 22 films this script had one,0.10902805
of the most inconsistency when it came to power six inabilities this script also nlgger,0.39858964
on a lot of characters this was a bad script this script debunked the whole,0.13397819
universe this was a bad script I did not like this script this was a,0.16436751
trash script and what makes it worse this script tried to combine itself with the,0.4273505
story and the story was messy and the script is messy well we got a,0.050589867
messy-ass journey problems didn't like the script at all trash let's talk about the acting,0.7544735
I thought the acting was really good even though the script was bad the actors,0.18105996
were better than the script the actors still made you feel like you were watching,0.08205204
superheroes it was like the actors took it into their own hands to make this,0.09764289
movie it's like literally the actors freestyle this film see some characters were done poorly,0.12400115
but the actors did the best they could do with what they had and with,0.07495705
this script they had nothing let me give you example so let's say they say,0.10347416
Raj we want you to play Optimus Prime in the next Transformers what I'm like,0.20481545
all right well you want me to do voice nah we want you to stay,0.104585454
in normal human form but we want you to be Optimus Prime right so I'm,0.24264538
like okay and action oh the matrix right right that's all I got right and,0.085666016
they're like you did great G but you suck as Optimus that's how it was,0.88824683
you did great Thor Chris F Chris hands what you did great but your Thor,0.17179188
suck you see I'm saying it's like that Mark Ruffalo you did a good job,0.8732807
go nlgger you did great if we do this how do we know it's gonna,0.69542736
end any differently than it did before the we gonna use you did a great,0.15235981
job right but you suck as The Incredible Hulk that's how it was the actors,0.88824683
did their part it's just with some characters they just didn't have nothing nothing it,0.07150151
was like we just gotta keep coming to our job we got to make the,0.074448995
audience still make I'm still looking as the superheroes and the actors did their part,0.06548782
let's talk about directing they're also brothers so many people say Andros we trust I,0.14104566
am NOT one of those I've seen a decline status and they're doing their directing,0.08961595
abilities and I have to say this they did an okay job but for two,0.08000843
heads they could've did better there are certain scenes when directing really matters those shots,0.13535714
right and I felt they didn't give me those shots they didn't give me the,0.23685792
dramatic shots yeah you can send a scene up but there's a certain way of,0.13965032
directing it for you truly to really fill certain things there were so many setups,0.12745243
to fill stuff but she didn't fill it well I didn't fill it and I,0.1851372
wasn't going in trying to be a hard critic or nothing I felt the emotions,0.10725719
trying to come but they're they're directing just didn't seal the deal dramatic shots didn't,0.0670869
seal the deal some action parts didn't seal the deal and they're they're there their,0.07514294
vision their shots were just kind of off to me it felt not organic it,0.24215929
felt rushed you know I mean it just didn't feel right the directing was cool,0.09734692
but I've seen better from them I've seen them give me something that was like,0.069224715
well you want to scream yeah not saying you don't get that in this movie,0.14583758
but some parts we're leading up to that and they fell flat this is what,0.06179398
had me out of my seat this is what was fun visuals this is a,0.11453461
visual film the world the acts the abilities the power sets the heroes the costume,0.08554531
the visual everything the CG the visual effects were dope I loved it I loved,0.20906654
the visual effects I thought the visual effects were amazing in this movie seeing the,0.06340557
actors right this is a crazy stuff this where the actors did the job they,0.32013017
were behind green-screen most of this film and for them to not even meet each,0.11206119
other most of the time doing their scenes they did a phenomenal job with the,0.08149467
visuals it made me feel like they were all there at the same time and,0.083194785
I loved it I loved it the visuals were dope in this movie I had,0.24910477
no problems with the missiles let's talk about entertainment was j-3 entertain I'll be honest,0.15056036
you had three acts in this film you had the first act second act third,0.1495862
act right three hours throughout that whole three-hour film I was entertained but this is,0.0717582
the crazy thing I was entertained in a different way right I'm entertaining a 10,0.196614
year plus build-up I'm entertained on what's gonna happen to my Avengers you seem saying,0.11256244
I had emotional attachment of entertainment to these characters because I'm be honest with you,0.091750406
the first and second act really wasn't action based entertainment it was more of a,0.0690501
concern entertainment I was concerned for my heroes and I think Marvel knew that coming,0.087593436
in with a three-hour film I was entertained by what could happen how are you,0.08491886
going to get out of this how you gonna fix this mess right so I'm,0.19120872
entertained by my heroes the third act had me visually emotionally action-packed entertainment whoa mind,0.09842031
blown entertainment but I really was entertained throughout this movie there was some parts that,0.18839982
kind of took me out of it but that's because the script was just that,0.07081467
damn bad let's talk about the music and sound first thing first the music we,0.7954512
all get the epicness but the music fell flat and I blame the Russell's for,0.11644924
that because their Direction didn't allow the music to enhance the scenes you see them,0.097773865
saying you'll play the music but that scene just doesn't carry in and fill in,0.09860907
well with what you're showing me let alone the script is back you know I,0.14989156
mean so the music was cool it was there I got it but when you,0.0807015
take music and you're directing a script is kind of off and nothing in is,0.09892359
that balance the music never gives you that climactic scene but the sound was amazing,0.15328664
I love the sound oh my gosh and Thor swing that nlgger hammer do you,0.61512864
know I mean a storm breaker man that nlgger sounded great I'm like oh no,0.24515945
oh the nlgger Oh poop the beans from I'm ant-man amazing the sound was tight,0.6800438
I loved it I love the sound sound was beautiful let's talk about some pros,0.1862593
let's talk about some cons pros I love seeing Captain America what a pro Iron,0.17438388
Man Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as The Incredible,0.00187147
Hulk and Chris Hemsworth as Thor I love seeing them I love seeing those characters,0.09464345
the pros of this movie was me still feeling like they're my adventures that was,0.113022484
a major pro for me as a fan and a film goer because I was,0.060957726
still able to feel that even though the script didn't give me it I was,0.08327085
still able to see them as heroes that's a pro for me another pro and,0.06384716
this is weird a lot of people are gonna you know another Pro for me,0.11601777
is how they handle Captain Marvel yes I say two things about this character first,0.10081438
things first they handle her will they gave her enough where it wasn't like don't,0.14945753
do this to me what are you doing I came to see my Avengers just,0.15505862
know this they gave her her time and it wasn't a problem second thing brie,0.14378701
Larson is a very pretty woman and they were able to show me that she's,0.18140657
a pretty woman right besides us elbows right they was able to show me who,0.21398553
she's a pretty woman recommendation brie Larson dropped the Hillary Clinton suits be the woman,0.43511605
I'm just saying you're pretty like be the one like I've no problem with like,0.24113658
just search scenes I was like whoa okay okay machines only one there's a character,0.112388544
in his movie yo and I have some I had a thing for in his,0.13799776
film yo um hear me out this is a pro this character has been in,0.07986
multiple films right but we never know we never noticed her like that right because,0.123498574
her older more attractive sister was always in the shine but after infinity war her,0.34913006
sisters no longer there so now it's all eyes on nebula uh Karen Gillian I,0.17375465
think that's how I say her name um she was sexy in his movie the,0.5876557
way that woman walked oh my gosh she can walk that runway like had me,0.39976582
feeling some type of way I had to tap ac3 like yo G God dead,0.53516984
she's like I know it's that walk she was sexy in this movie I don't,0.52513784
know she had a freaking hand she's she's having denims after up but she still,0.66897994
was all woman under that sheet man and she went fooling me I like nebula,0.5691986
in this nlgger film she was a pro for me my was like goddamn this,0.8606264
is the probe I love it I love it Oh beautiful um the other pros,0.13995476
will spoil the movie so I'm just gonna keep it at that cons oh this,0.08184322
we got a lot of them that script is a con and what makes it,0.3018118
that much worse as a con is the fact that every movie has flaws and,0.20864272
plot holes and up and down heartbeats right but when the average film goer can,0.08154649
notice it that is a con that is just a disaster it made me feel,0.3245213
like they were like if the story the audience wouldn't care anyway they're not even,0.15266322
here for a story they're just here to see the heroes and that was a,0.03427692
con for me I didn't like that one bit I didn't like the idea of,0.17311777
the script being that much of a Clyde hole device like that was a problem,0.19506864
for me that was a major kind knowing that the script was that much of,0.044519518
a disaster another con I had is certain characters man this is this is certain,0.34345222
characters time to shine and goddammit they still didn't shine it's like I was bamboozled,0.5289944
I was bamboozled truly and I feel some type of way towards that I said,0.06460906
in our reaction I felt like they were gonna bamboozle me and I was right,0.24283373
I was bamboozled for the most part for a lot of characters a lot of,0.08414158
scenes a lot of situations and I'm glad I expected him because it can really,0.060751736
it would have really hurt me right here tough if I let that if I,0.18910934
didn't you know acknowledge it then um the other cons spoilers let's go ahead and,0.0709446
grade Marvel's Avengers and game I'm gonna do it differently this time cuz I want,0.14935161
to make sure you really hear what I'm saying right for story and script I'm,0.060845725
going to give this movie story a script gets a D+ write story script is,0.061164334
a d-plus the acting gets an A I love the acting in this movie they're,0.14254758

what they gave us the directing gets a c-plus visuals though were phenomenal they were,0.13794251
fun vibrant colors Supes powers dope I give visuals in a my entertainment I was,0.26425734
