greetings fellow Gor house and welcome back to another blood-splattered vlog so I just got,0.44512913
back from Wonder Woman the latest entry in the DC Cinematic Universe I guess it's,0.10583158
called anyway this is a movie that I've been anticipating with a lot of hesitation,0.10557278
and by that I mean I've been very weary about this film and the reason,0.082268864
why I've been so weary is because on one hand I hated Batman V Superman,0.1944507
and Man of Steel and this movie's supposed to be a continuation of the universe,0.07012605
that those two films started but on the other hand Suicide Squad was pretty fun,0.19699168
despite being a complete and utter mess from start to finish and on top of,0.27021503
that the trailers for this movie made this movie look great especially the latest trailer,0.09196586
that was released a few weeks ago that one was phenomenal but even so I've,0.06677006
been burned before there have been many movies where the trailer was fantastic and I,0.30941072
ended up extremely disappointed in the theater in fact I would put Man of Steel,0.16081288
right on that list but now I have finally seen Wonder Woman and now that,0.065907374
I have I can say without any hesitation that Wonder Woman is wonderful this is,0.15031797
the kind of movie I've been wanting DC to produce ever since they started this,0.09574299
idea of a DC Cinematic Universe they brought to life one of their most iconic,0.09850356
characters in an extremely faithful way while still doing a little bit of their own,0.07245749
thing but not in any way that takes away from the original core of the,0.06181284
character this is still Wonder Woman she's still fighting for truth she's still fighting for,0.15220067
justice she's still fighting for love in fact the core theme of this movie could,0.1170983
really be summed up with love not war this is one of the best superhero,0.09224041
movies ever made I put this up there with some of my favorites like spider-man,0.16518565
2 and The Avengers 2 movies that got to the core of their characters and,0.0423285
brought them to life in a way that I never thought was possible and this,0.14641853
movie did that with Wonder Woman and oh my god I was cheering in the,0.14713117
theater multiple times and one of the things I really like is that the director,0.037274595
of this movie took the visuals that Dec Snyder was doing with the Batman V,0.07304686
Superman movies and added more color to it so that it wasn't completely like dire,0.13989368
and dark the whole time this movie saved it's d saturated scenes for scenes where,0.07105846
it's appropriate like the war scenes but for the scenes were Wonder Woman is saving,0.110737845
the day that's when her colors are shining brightly on the screen and it's beautiful,0.109192304
in fact every frame of this movie is gorgeous and the writing matches that beauty,0.07543953
and so does the acting and so does the score everything about this movie is,0.073220395
perfect they even have one the best fight scenes I've seen in a superhero movie,0.119539976
since the fight scene between spider-man and Doc Ock on the train which for me,0.19428067
that fight scene is the crown jewel of all superhero fight scene so the fact,0.0974781
that this would be managed to match that is amazing may I take that back,0.0711451
it's not amazing it's wonderful and that's another thing this movie has action in spectacle,0.11869427
that's almost on par with what's in Man of Steel except in this case you,0.12848362
actually care because this movie makes you not only feel for Wonder Woman herself but,0.13310827
also the side characters around her and all the random people she's saving I couldn't,0.09405096
give two shits about anyone in Manas feel especially Superman but here there were points,0.835217
where I was so excited that I can feel my heart beating out of my,0.31716642
chest out of just pure adrenaline and the cherry on top of this utterly delicious,0.20586349
cake is at the end of the movie they included the shot that I've been,0.099773206
waiting for since they said they were going to do a Wonder Woman movie and,0.10265126
that is of course the iconic shot of her lifting up a tank with her,0.31089434
bare hands and the moment that happened in this movie I stood up in the,0.07219059
theater and cheered as loud as I could and I wasn't alone a lot of,0.07734632
the other people in the theater with me also cheered so yeah my fellow gore,0.16070786
hounds I know it's not a horror movie I know it's not bloody I know,0.38569954
it's pg-13 but a good movie is a good movie and Wonder Woman is a,0.15296347
great movie so go check it out in theaters and if you would like to,0.14751899
listen to the Wonder Woman soundtrack I will include an Amazon affiliate link in the,0.07368238
description below and if you click that link and buy the soundtrack from that link,0.074367836
then I will get a kickback from it and with all that said my fellow,0.19512428
gore hounds let us move on to this spoilers alrighty then so this movie is,0.17244536
bookended by a prologue and an epilogue of Wonder Woman in the modern day and,0.03309185
she receives this package from Bruce Wayne that includes a picture of her from World,0.11441866
War 1 and upon seeing this picture and her standing with her old team from,0.3736437
back then she starts reminiscing about her origins so we flash all the way back,0.114095226
to when she was a little girl living on some mascara the amazon island and,0.18435216
she's just an adorable rebellious little who desperately wants to learn how to fight but,0.44224855
her mom who also happens to be the queen does not want her to but,0.46465883
her mom's sister disagrees because she believes there's going to become a day where diana,0.45916072
is going to have to learn to defend herself and luckily for diana her happens,0.09353576
to be the greatest warrior the Amazons have ever seen so her aunt starts training,0.067708574
her in secret much to the chagrin of her mother we flash forward a few,0.21361773
years to win Diana as a teenager and her mom finds out and gets really,0.2622063
mad at her sister but her sister insists one more time that diana is absolutely,0.4035018
going to need to defend herself one day so she needs to train her and,0.10304459
this time her mom realizes that there's no way she's going to stop this so,0.23785204
she reluctantly agrees and this is when the real training begins we then flash forward,0.05282175
once again to Diana as an adult after a shit-ton of intense training in fact,0.82030046
they even say that they trained her harder than any other Amazon before her including,0.11368378
her aunt who like I said is supposed to be the greatest warrior the Amazons,0.14268519
I've ever seen so far but now that she's an adult she must prove herself,0.15362176
to her mom by defeating her aunt but she lets her guard down because it's,0.38839495
her aunt which causes her aunt could flip out on her and just start hitting,0.74502325
her with some really harsh tough love but when Diana blocks with her bracelets they,0.15430629
have like a Dragonball Z style like energy burst burst out of her which causes,0.11525853
her aunt to get knocked on her ass and the rest of the Amazons around,0.9430079
her to look at her in fear she then runs off understandably emotionally distressed at,0.15438898
what just happened and she happens to run over to this cliff just as this,0.19015768
by plane this World War 1 by plane breaks through the barrier that surrounds the,0.10923484
island and just crashes into the bay and she runs out to save the pilot,0.09091966
and of course the pilot turned out to be Trevor's who in the comics was,0.05150434
the man who essentially triggered Wonder Woman to leave the island which is essentially what,0.39898732
happens here she saved Trevor's just as the Germans break through the barrier to get,0.110834636
to him there's this gorgeous and super intense action sequence on the beach as the,0.10326414
Germans and the Amazons collide and of course with the help of Trevor's the Amazons,0.11344871
end up winning but not before Diana's aunt takes a bullet for her and she,0.16728956
dies in a legitimately moving scene you actually care about this end even though she's,0.38770336
only been in the movie for about 15 minutes which just tells you how great,0.09404048
the storytelling is in this movie that you care so much about this character with,0.100890964
so little screen time just god damn it's so good so anyway the Amazons use,0.69542736
the lasso of truth on Trevor's which gets him to admit that he was a,0.05915521
spy for the British government and that he had infiltrated this one German base and,0.19946171
discovered this super secret bio weapon that they had planned on using on the western,0.187061
front a weapon so chemically corrosive that it literally dissolves gas masks so there ain't,0.15141532
no escaping it you're gonna die if it's unleashed and of course Diana upon warning,0.7350845
about world war one believes it's her sacred duty to go out there and stop,0.28352165
this war because according to the story her mom read to her at the beginning,0.28579557
of the movie when she was a little girl most it's not all wars are,0.1748799
a result of Ares the God of War and the Amazons are the sworn enemy,0.28798136
of Ares in fact their island was built to protect this one sword called the,0.10426745
god killer which was apparently created by Zeus for the sole purpose of killing Ares,0.6364068
because apparently a long time ago Ares much like Lucifer declared war on the heavens,0.31089434
and he ended up killing all the other gods in the process with the single,0.7386902
exception of Zeus though you never actually see him in this movie so Diana decides,0.116217114
she's going to go to the world of man and she's gonna find Ares and,0.35578394
stop this war her mom really doesn't want her to do it but diana is,0.5154597
not one to listen to anyone but herself and i love her for it she,0.19232725
is a stubborn badass so she takes the lasso of truth she takes the Wonder,0.56531847
Woman outfit and she takes the god killer sword and they take off on a,0.503331
boat to London so I'm not exactly sure where sem máscara is supposed to be,0.123983316
because they arrive at London really fast which I suppose I could complain about that,0.055947553
but I love the movie so much as that minor weird thing didn't really bug,0.10437838
me at all so when they get to London they decide they need to get,0.061123293
new clothes because he's still dressed like a German pilot and she looks like warrior,0.31543636
princess and they need some sort of normal street clothes so that they can blend,0.12014832
in with the rest of the city so they have this really funny scene where,0.06760817
Trevor's his secretary is getting her to try on all these outfits but she's like,0.100969054
breaking them and ripping them because they don't quite work with her movements and yeah,0.56060034
we've kind of seen seems like this before the entirety of Encino man is basically,0.100539945
this scene in a nutshell but it's funny and I really enjoyed it hell did,0.5154597
I just bring up Encino man in a Wonder Woman review what's wrong with me,0.1690413
so anyway they meet up with Trevor's commander and he refuses to actually go through,0.05897403
with stopping this chemical weapon because apparently they're really close to peace and they don't,0.14544386
want to ruin that good faith by sending troops into German territory which pisses off,0.548423
Diana and I love the scene where she screams at all those generals in that,0.2618297
room it is great so Trevor's decides that they're going to go into German territory,0.10841552
themselves but first they need a team and this right here is the part of,0.04739649
the movie that feels the most like Captain America the First Avenger because Trevor's introduces,0.08783025
her to this group of misfits that essentially kind of feel like the Howling Commandos,0.53490317
Captain America but before they leave one of the aristocrats who was in that meeting,0.31089434
with all the generals and was preaching for peace he shows up and pledges his,0.14710268
secret support to trevor's and a team and then off they go to the Western,0.06222219
Front where we get one of the greatest superhero moments in superhero movie history where,0.0687502
Wonder Woman learns about no man's land seize all the victims of no man's land,0.16635883
and decides to end no man's land she climbs out of the trench and stands,0.14548498
tall as all the Germans are shooting at her and she's deflecting the bullets with,0.49709845
her armed guards and it's just awesome this is like aw man this is what,0.25706133
superhero movies are all about and goddamn it I'm going to stop the point by,0.7093121
point synopsis here because this movie is just too good to spoil one thing I,0.09912397
will say though is that Ares is actually in this movie and he has an,0.08367883
amazing fight scene with Wonder Woman and he is a character that I kind of,0.12859894
figured was going to end up being Ares from the get-go because when Diana's mom,0.24034245
tells her about Ares as a detail she gives about Ares and there's only one,0.11290862
character over the course of the movie who matches that detail so it was really,0.056441158
obvious to me who Ares was over the course of the movie but to some,0.09457314
other people it might be more surprising anyway just goddamn I have to end this,0.80571634
