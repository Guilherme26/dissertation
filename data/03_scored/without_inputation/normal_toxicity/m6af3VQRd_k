welcome back to my channel,0.09652933
and this is my review for the 2019 French film portrait of a lady on fire,0.18630297
this movie was directed by Celine ski Amma,0.11462904
and this is about a young painter who is commissioned to paint a portrait of a bride-to-be,0.08164005
but the bride is reluctant,0.11670354
she does not want to get married,0.15712444
and so this painter must paint her in secret as she spends every single day with her walking on the beach and just being a friend and little does the bride-to-be know that she is being painted by someone she admires and respects,0.07239231
this is a film that I've wanted to see for a while,0.06685677
it's a movie that you know kind of was unjustly not nominated for the Academy Awards,0.07326584
and I thought that was a little interesting,0.06220192
so I wanted to see really what this movie was truly about,0.09479929
and if this movie did deserve an Oscar nomination for Best International Feature,0.061857484
and I gotta say that it deserved a Best International Feature nomination this is a movie that is beautiful number one,0.0557419
the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking,0.07573801
it is the first film to be conceived that I have seen in 8k all of the colors are so rich,0.06542964
they're so clear,0.05604692
I mean it looks unrealistic because it's so realistic,0.08832914
and that's the thing that this movie truly has going for it is it has this beautiful way of almost painting,0.09596993
every single scene knowing that this is a movie about a painter who has to paint this bride-to-be,0.090039
and this is a film that has a beautiful love story that is almost hopeful but yet hopeless,0.076713935
and that's the thing that I think I I loved the most about this film is it tells it from a very real perspective,0.07731992
these two women they fall in love,0.53633934
but the problem is is that there's no way that this romance is ever going to last and because of certain obligations that one of them has to having to be married to a man that she doesn't even know or she hasn't even met and this this painter who kind of lives by herself and has to be almost independent and so it's a very secretive affair or relationship that these two women have,0.24207954
and it's told from a very realistic perspective of how this actually would never happen in a true society back in the time period that this movie said him,0.089297146
that's one thing that this movie has going for is that it is a very beautiful love story that truly shows the true strengths and the true weaknesses of a true romantic encounter in true romantic relationship,0.07141457
and these women it's almost like they have to rush everything all at once because they only have so much time to spend with one another before they both have to part and go their separate ways,0.39501837
and it's it's heartbreaking,0.047511086
it's very heart wrenching and you feel for these two characters as they finally have that happiness,0.0742684
that they've been longing for throughout the entirety of their lives,0.18841569
now the thing about this movie to me also that I thought was very well done is the way that this movie paints the scene of the setting around these characters again the cinematography is almost painted on it's so gorgeous but to setting them itself on this island it just almost has an eeriness to it it's it's almost a little creepy but they never try to go for a hauntings,0.1438018
and that's the thing that I really respect it for because this is a movie you could look at in certain scenes where you think oh are they gonna go like a little bit more of a paranormal route are they gonna go like a little bit,0.1077469
more of this like creepy contingent route but they never do that they keep it very contained,0.13851233
they know exactly what they're doing,0.06279703
and it's a very different romantic film because it's it's a movie that almost essentially is it romantic,0.06773056
and the fact that it is so romantic and I don't know if that makes a lot of sense but they don't ever truly romanticize these characters or make them out as their objects and that it's a very lustful relationship,0.08713428
it's very much a loving relationship between these two characters,0.061342362
the one thing that I will say is is not a negative but it's something that I was a little bit maybe dissatisfied,0.10554408
with is the way that the movie wraps up because I thought that to me the way that they ended it made sense but to me I was a little dissatisfied in the way that this movie kind of wraps itself up because essentially these two characters after they have their romantic time together and they have this love for one another they go on their separate ways,0.101244174
and essentially they don't ever really meet up again,0.078060634
only in certain sir stances that I don't want to discuss,0.12244834
because I don't want to rob you of any spoilers or any potential spoilers for this film,0.28969723
and so the way that they kind of wrapped these characters up in the satisfaction of them kind of meeting again at the end of the film never happens and it never comes into fruition,0.07962716
and so that is a little bit disappointing because you definitely want to see the conclusion between these two characters and the restitution as well between both of them as they both have this longing for one another and they do things that are beautiful that symbolize that both of them still love each other but they don't do it to the effect of bringing them together,0.1612413
and that's the one thing that I think this movie could have done a little bit better of a job of doing,0.1457443
but I get the fact that they want to be more realistic and they don't want it to be like essentially a formulaic romantic film but anyway guys this is a great movie I think that this is a fantastic international film that I think all of you can enjoy,0.07551398
and I'm really happy that I was able to watch it as part of my foreign cinema review series anyway guys,0.060964443
