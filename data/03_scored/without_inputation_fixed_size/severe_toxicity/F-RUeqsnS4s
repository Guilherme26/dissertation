hey so today I'm going to be talking about the film moonlight I had a,0.014087925
chance to see it's why it was so good um so Mumma is directed by,0.018645763
Barry Jenkins and was co-written with Terrell mcrainey based off of a play that Terrell,0.057094708
actually did and then Barry came in and helped him finish writing the film I'm,0.032156307
so this film is starring my harsh on lolly travante roads and Andre Holland the,0.098899506
acting was so superb in this film I can't wait to delve into that and,0.053850606
they let in the later part of this video but who this one was so,0.062648326
good that has he is twice I'm the first time I saw it was through,0.044790804
a USC so University of Southern California I went to their cinema school so there,0.025777197
is the African American cinema society aacs and they put on an event with another,0.061695784
group named queer cut and that's how I was able to see this film before,0.044549346
I hit theaters and then of course my friend she's an actress and she invited,0.19383518
me to see it again and I was like all right I'll go ahead and,0.03095299
see it twice because that's how good it was and I also want to make,0.04162453
sure that supported in the box office it's sometimes hard for people who get like,0.018770153
exclusive sneak peeks and get to see films beforehand just do to like industry connections,0.032947212
but then we forget that you have to support it opening weekend when it comes,0.01427351
to the box office so this is a limited release but it's definitely more cities,0.034386
now I know it's in Los Angeles and San Francisco New York and a few,0.015543346
other places so look it up and if it's in your area go see it,0.052705824
if it's about a couple hours away it's our trust me it's worth the draw,0.05038234
it's worth the drive for sure and i'm originally from sacramento so all my sacramento,0.078210294
people i promise you is worth that drives to the Bay Area next time you're,0.04346576
in the bay go ahead and check it out was so good so really love,0.05004775
the music in this film the music was actually heavy and played a big role,0.036707494
in it because it's interesting like typically in films on here that much music so,0.046280816
it kind of like a music video at time and I really like that because,0.03169334
in films called the number one critique are always skates that put too much music,0.027917758
in my film they always critique me on that so I love this film because,0.054753263
I'm like finally it worked someone proved that you can have multiple songs playing really,0.017556857
loud in films and it just actually adds to the flume except taken away but,0.04133052
I always always always had that as a critique that like I didn't that I've,0.016497219
put too much music in my film so I really let's see so I sometimes,0.030788025
I did think that this man fini style music was a little too much I,0.22255449
think that the characters or the actors express their emotions enough and that the music,0.010314338
wasn't really needed and I feel like it just was forcing me to be more,0.043607444
sad trying to be a tearjerker but the film was a tearjerker on its own,0.09067717
there is no need for that so something left out the symphony music was a,0.024549268
little too much but I did like how they're different um there are different song,0.033052977
choices for each version or sirens life so when I looked on the playlist once,0.026864106
but on Spotify like the soundtrack to the film there's like a certain song for,0.049478356
Sharon and the child chevron has a teen then as an adult somebody like how,0.09518179
they play with those musical scores and how they gave a different musical score to,0.0116280755
each character to one character but for each section of his life as he grew,0.011666656
so I really like that um also classic man by Gina chopped n skrewed was,0.29437825
Jean yes like it was so good when he pulled up and like put on,0.058011997
a fresh tea to go meet with Kevin after all these years and was playing,0.0143087655
classic man and it was just it was perfect I love it um yeah it,0.11228899
was perfect that really reminds me a lot of like a typical Florida against the,0.069850266
kind of dude so they embodied that role so well so well um and also,0.04162453
I really really like the song it's pronounced coo coo coo coo coo paloma um,0.4344564
and that's the song that's played in the middle either in the car and it's,0.013957549
like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah koo koo roo Paloma and it's so beautiful I,0.11690736
did look it up online and luckily I caught like a live version with an,0.04032676
orchestra in the back and this man singing live in it's just such a beautiful,0.098784424
song so I suggest you all look it up it wasn't on the Spotify soundtrack,0.057840377
and to the film moonlight but I found it online on YouTube and it was,0.02228964
just so beautiful sea I love the way they used music at times I thought,0.04175757
it was a bit too heavy and made it a little bit too emotional but,0.05514306
everything about it was just so perfect I love love love they used a lot,0.037546955
of music in this the directing and the writing were so good so very jenkins,0.02414284
said that he was pulled out of retirement after seeing a play that l wrote,0.026100475
that was a sort of based off of the film moonlight so to pull Barry,0.01141189
Jenkins out of other words hired me like and now I understand why because this,0.06519731
story is so good and he was saying it also relates a lot to his,0.03107472
personal life so what I thought was really interesting from listening to the interview again,0.028839037
on fresh Air's that Barry was saying thats frills I really quiet and he was,0.023261473
saying in the okay so barians ro actually know each other actually grew up in,0.055204257
the same like apartment complex they went to the same school at the same time,0.026215553
in elementary so they've known each other for a very long time and bury the,0.12442127
director was sent teams to the co-writer Terrell Amen as long as I've known you,0.021925783
still can only say about six words and it's interesting because that's also a line,0.018954407
that Kevin uses for sure on in this so i love how even though of,0.035782225
course the variant or aren't romantically together they still kind of see themselves in the,0.028787153
worlds of kevin and in shy Ron and I think that plays really well for,0.03573167
the two writers because they're sort of expressing their friendship through this um this lovers,0.06932544
storyline so I really like that and the lighting was so so so so good,0.03318734
I love when we see this like pink lighting on the mom she's yelling at,0.25056508
chevron as a kid and Barry said that he did that because he remembered his,0.1464302
mom being like with the angry and being on drugs and he was a really,0.109183244
young child like he like under five years old and he just sort of i,0.19213696
think as a kid who just sort of remember things and colors you don't really,0.036325015
know what's going on and that's why it's silence when she's yelling at him at,0.095207736
first and juicy colors because in our memory that's what we see as kids no,0.07616353
colors and kind of see actions so i thought that was so beautiful but the,0.0295142
pink the hot pink sort of added to her her anger England hear what she,0.114975
was saying we could just tell her she was screaming and the pink colors X,0.07258351
the passion so so well lit and of course the blue on the black on,0.23740375
the dark black skin representing the moonlight they reflected off the black skin that my,0.33122283
harsh realities character explains and that's how you got his nickname blue cuz she was,0.07915752
saying when the moonlight comes out and the boys play in the street in Cuba,0.05831665
that it makes the black boys with blue so I really loved a thought I,0.16333318
was I'm so beautiful and of course using blue light on dark skin actors is,0.3102042
you have two very talented you know how to light dark skinned people in general,0.5906697
because a lot of people just teach you how to how to light white actors,0.24329717
in films gorgeous give practice on different sets you just have more opportunities to light,0.08424351
white people vs dark-skinned people but the way that the colors reflected off his skin,0.52845687
especially the night scenes and the scenes and the water it was just so beautiful,0.035723686
so I love love love than not the lighting in here it really helped tell,0.04396997
this story more um and also I just love like it was sort of like,0.023786968
a love story between the writer and director about their friendship but also the love,0.01662427
story between shy Ron and Kevin and I'm a huge sucker for love story so,0.28437254
this one was so beautiful um yeah I just I loved it it was all,0.064137675
about like falling in love with the hood Florida man and i loved it was,0.15714698
so good so yeah i'm directing and writing were amazing and two talented people i'm,0.020386549
so glad i was into the interview so again go to I'm npr's website National,0.061270732
Public Radio watch the show fresh air it's hosted by terry gross and there's an,0.079424925
interview on there should be one of the most recent ones and it's with bear,0.051246412
jenkins and terrell mccraney and adds so much more detailed and insight so I saw,0.039092842
the film first then I listened to the interview and I went and saw the,0.014191693
film again and it helped me so much well I'll just like unpacking the film,0.01818612
and then with my own emotions and find my personal connection to the film I,0.024657028
just want to say that all the actors did such a great job in this,0.048934236
film they were superb there's a riveting performance from everyone I was shocked by the,0.022567686
younger actors the teenage actors everyone did is such a great job but for the,0.01195468
character of Kevin I literally love those actors so much they were my favorite they,0.037283543
made me kind of like this fall in love more with Kevin he's the love,0.062492672
interest in the film so I think it sort of worked but they honestly did,0.018047098
the best so Kevin as a teenage was played by jor-el Jerome such a cutie,0.014439141
and I think he did an amazing job he felt more comfortable in his role,0.026220875
as well I think he's supposed to be more confident actor because obviously our confident,0.024563901
character because obviously Kevin is more confident and himself then I'm shy Ron is then,0.028839702
also of course Andre Holland just like killed it as adult version of Kevin but,0.27040642
I really thought all the actors for the character of Kevin were just perfect on,0.024895828
spot you can so they're comfortable with their role they knew everything they were supposed,0.012161553
to do from their body language the way they spoke to their tone to everything,0.06930881
one of my favorite lines Andre hollandaise um when he looks at shy Ron and,0.05699626
he's like man right up in front song and it's funny because like a gold,0.0742784
grill and like it's called a front like oh your gold fronts that's what they're,0.03788487
called but it's sort of a play on words because the word front end is,0.014448454
also slang for someone who's faking the truth or not showing who they really are,0.16815244
so he keeps like adding line we got confront song like that but he's actually,0.040893495
saying like why are you fronting um so I just I really like to play,0.022418018
on words of course I was more not to go riding but just the way,0.041026533
he delivered that bad line it could have been very very corny like very corny,0.20805681
but he just uses like more of a play on words not I really loved,0.044647127
it so he was so smooth and again both jor-el and Andre were so confident,0.021095634
and comfortable in their roles so they did an amazing job you've seen the crackhead,0.08053977
black mom over and over again or the drug addict mother over and over again,0.63523066
but Naomi Harris just adding something different to it and also get a nod to,0.03469864
the writing wasn't it was a more loving depiction of a of a drug abusing,0.33154592
mother you know what I mean even though he wanted to hate Naomi cares no,0.25791135
me Harris his character we sort of so had love for her especially at the,0.040103257
end much I wrong goes and visits her at the rehab center the halfway house,0.04371321
so even though she's like obviously being a horrible mother and she has that scene,0.36713064
where she's telling him not to treat Janelle monáe's character better than her cuz she,0.057847697
is his mom as she's hustling him down for money she's obviously doing the action,0.16755776
that isn't that proves he's not a good mom but this means verbally saying like,0.08460271
I am your mom you're my one and only so she just she nailed it,0.26972196
she killed it she's amazing so happy to see what role she does after this,0.5736984
it was just a beauty to see her on-screen um also I've talked about mahakali,0.06109579
and other things I first saw him in house of cars then I found out,0.03309222
he was in cakes and then I saw him on Luke Cage so he's killing,0.45498517
it with the netflix TV shows and also the independent films so I love the,0.01713114
roles that he's choosing he is very talented he could play a villain if you,0.09058338
pay good guy and play a politician that you can play hood he's just really,0.04765043
nice I mean it's interesting because in the film kicks maresciallo also plays a like,0.071507245
gangster father figure um and he does that as well in this film but he,0.07992248
switches it up he's actually supposed to be from Cuba in this film and I,0.04375844
love how it's sort of a similar character but he didn't play it the same,0.009110355
way and that shows you the true talent of an actor anyway I can go,0.101073325
on and on about my her shallow so I also wanted to talk about Janelle,0.06649708
Monae this is the first time I've seen her on screen I'm i knows she's,0.07669767
also in the film hidden figures coming up we'll be doing a review on that,0.008522333
too hopefully but you know when I was really good I think towards the end,0.05373021
there were times where I thought she could have been a bit stronger when she,0.07572517
was making up the bed with the character of shy Ron and she was like,0.05937296
why would you you know do a bad job making up the babe try and,0.09298403
make me come over here and fix it on purpose I thought that wasn't that,0.0642747
strong um but she's still budding actress so I thought the way she played off,0.11184797
on my her shala was really good when she played with the younger version and,0.07386465
shy ron was really good so I enjoyed her and I loved her in this,0.0750693
world I'm happy to see her getting work also her hair looked perfect like in,0.0679678
every scene oh how she does it and Janelle Monae must have must be drinking,0.22044851
from the fountain of youth me my friend watching it were like why she was,0.06739641
19 like why does she look so young bene Raia it's like all-star amazing cast,0.07561541
fresh faces and some of them some of these faces we've seen before if you,0.0513422
off all theater you've seen some of these faces before but either way these are,0.058679175
not like a list celebrities yet they killed it is a very talented talented group,0.36237654
in the acting was amazing in this film so everyone go support the field might,0.047323827
it is an incredible film I can't guarantee that i'll make you cry but it'll,0.05697431
definitely make you think and feel i think this one was very important right now,0.0426549
to tell the narrative of a young black boy a young poor black boy and,0.41765982
a young poor black boy from the south especially with the way that black men,0.5354527
and women and young people are dying in this country I'm and being targeted by,0.21742192
police and other racist people which is really important to show this side that even,0.41770288
though someone might have a criminal record and might look very aggressive they actually just,0.038418345
a very very soft heart warming person on the inside so I think this one,0.0903366
so incredible perfect for our time right now I think this is a part of,0.040233634
the black artists of our time healing us because our people need a lot of,0.35029846
healing right now so this is definitely one for the books it's a classic I,0.02095395
love it so much so yeah go support moonlight thanks for watching this review in,0.021255944
