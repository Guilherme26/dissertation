once again I find myself wrestling with how I felt about a comic book film a popular comic book film and if there's one thing the internet supports its gracious differences of opinion,0.074791536
so before anybody else loses their damn mind on my channel just purely based on the title of the video,0.81533664
let me just preface that thor ragnarok is an earn it,0.15214309
that's right,0.058336746
I'm giving you my verdict on this film in the first twenty seconds of this video just to calm everyone down,0.16181165
I like the movie but really just barely,0.103869624
now if you're the kind of person that loved this film unabashedly and can't stand to hear any criticism about it you should probably just move on but if you're genuinely interested in hearing my thoughts on the film phase three and the future of the MCU then please by all means join the conversation,0.25492463
now for those of you clicking on this video who know nothing about my channel you're probably thinking to yourself this guy barely liked Thor Ragnarok must be a DC fanboy right no if I could talk about DC for a second and I will let's face it Man of Steel was okay Wonder Woman was good,0.27802765
but the rest of it was pretty much a hot mess but it's not about DC,0.12505274
the fact is Marvel fans in the past myself included seem to think that Marvel is infallible,0.11666152
but the problem is that neither DC nor Marvel seemingly want to admit that they may have problems which will ultimately just lead to more problems DC seemingly can admit that other than Wonder Woman totally their films have been a mess Suicide,0.31278682
Squad is a perfect example of how they just can't seem to find a good balance between humor and the dark of grittiness they really want to go for it,0.07405247
but Marvel on the flip side needs to admit that at times their films are too light too jovial to joke written and as a result none of them really feel like there are any real consequences,0.12164091
within the story and if you're the kind of person who's blindly devoted to only one side of this if you say to yourself screw Marvel I don't need their baby rainbow-colored or screw DC,0.46330863
I don't need their dark ideological dumpster fire I wish I were you,0.7463852
I wish I had the kind of misguided self righteousness and confidence typically only reserved for Nazis,0.50565517
and Harvey Weinstein unnecessarily harsh perhaps but it needs to be said and here's what I'm really good something,0.059535477
I've said before when DC and marvel truly compete when they are in fact equals we as the audience went because they have to produce the best films available if there's no real competition then they can shell out whatever they want because they know we're gonna pay for it,0.035286658
but right now Marvel seems to be getting a little overconfident and that's because so far while DC is competing financially,0.08310723
they're not necessarily competing critically,0.08704307
and you know what Marvel is showing their overconfidence because right now in my opinion phase,0.12681699
3 is their weakest phase because so far with ant-man Doctor Strange guardians of the galaxy 2 and now clora Ragnarok it's been their most comedic phase comedy in a Marvel movie is obviously one of their stables,0.16571431
and made me fall in love with the MCU but is this a little too much in small doses humor can add layers it can add interest,0.128238
it can change up the tone appropriately from the very dark tone that a lot of comic book films are now going for however that's in small doses and with Marvel films,0.11513238
their jokes seem to be very obvious at times even juvenile and humor is now starting to define their films in Thor Ragnarok the humor is constant,0.17295113
it's an incessant stream of characters trying to one-up one another when it comes to your and you know what it's really starting to change of iconic characters into something they're not,0.08555534
this may have to do with the report that much of the film was actually improvised but that actually caused a lot of issues number one everyone on the team because let's face it most comic book films feature a lot of characters not just one solo character but everyone on the team is suddenly the same character here's what I mean by that when the Avengers got together in 2012,0.054235373
yeah everybody told a joke or two but really there is only one of them who was considered the funny one that goes to Tony Stark in Phase two Marvel really followed the formula that Whedon set out in the Avengers,0.14982045
the fact that within the team there always has to be one wisecracking superhero the most obvious being star-lord in guardians of the galaxy but in Phase three they amped that up even more suddenly within every superhero film in every group,0.092074074
there are three or four funny ones guardians of,0.05425169
the galaxy,0.10860031
two is a perfect example star-lord is still wisecracking but Rocket Raccoon this game even Drax the one who is the straight man in the first film with a few dry,0.18710454
jokes,0.052989513
he's cracking wise,0.0880213
about his own feces,0.7297907
thor ragnarok had that problem,0.10519473
but made it exponentially worse because every character for most of the time they are on screen they are trying to be funny it was a huge shift in tone and character from the first two Thor films and you know what it changed the characters of both Ford and Hulk even new characters who could have easily balanced all the humor coming from two iconic Avengers,0.046990305
were humorous characters scourge was very silly compared to the original source material in the comic books cork who's extremely serious in the very serious Planet,0.40326425
Hulk storyline does nothing,0.07364827
but joke even hella the goddess of death loves to throw in a few quips you do have to admit though Jeff Goldblum stole the show in previous Marvel films especially in phase 1 & 2 there was a much better balance of humor drama and action sure there were jokes in the previous films but they had other things to,0.13041006
it and with these characters constantly trying to be,0.059930414
funny it makes me not take any of them,0.27195817
seriously you see you can have the,0.07484499
characters tell jokes without dumb themselves becoming jokes this film also did the same thing with epic Marvel storylines they wasted them because they didn't take them seriously Planet Hulk was one of the best laid out storylines in the Marvel comics,0.5154597
it was one of the best stories for Hulk period and you know what it was relegated,0.05165213
it was nothing better than a side story much like my favorite,0.09931914
superhero Hulk who was nothing more than a sidekick all I'm saying is Marvel just don't waste greatness,0.25068104
and if I'm to be impartial which a good critic should be I have to use part of the same criticism I had for Batman V,0.06051221
Superman the Planet Hulk story,0.055806413
got pushed aside for one very obvious reason because much like Batman V Superman marvel this time tried to do too much the death of Odin,0.26624963
the introduction of three new major characters a little of the Ragnarok story a little Planet Hulk and even a Doctor Strange cameo the last major that I had an issue with this film is the reason that I've already mentioned,0.0697249
and you know what it's one,0.074998274
that has given the MCU a lot of criticism,0.050564643
and that is the fact that there just doesn't seem like there are any consequences within this universe DC fans have really taken notice,0.066651486
and once again I think the thor ragnarok just made it worse,0.1522189
a lot of people,0.072248116
not just DC fans have noticed that death in the MCU for the most part means next to nothing Coulson Bucky Nick Fury all died to mean something to push our characters in a much more important direction,0.30783612
and they did only for those dead people to come back almost immediately,0.41384804
if you think about some of the deaths in thor ragnarok most notably the Warriors 3 what did their deaths do they didn't inspire,0.11359363
Thor it was almost as if you didn't know that they died it was a terrible tribute to three characters,0.13515015
and in two previous Thor films were like his brothers in my opinion,0.08117625
even Owens death was kind of brushed aside which was too bad because that scene in particular was some of the best writing in the film probably because it wasn't comedic,0.13174269
it was a character building moment,0.048899334
but if you think about it once again any time there could have been a great character building moment the breakup with Jane Thor's relationship with hella his father's death nothing happened it didn't go anywhere,0.17579827
and what's with Loki standing in the middle of New York like he didn't try to destroy the city five years ago and that really sums it up for me,0.10638935
but you know what the funniest part is within,0.047698215
thor ragnarok there's actually a scene that personifies this problem Thor says to Loki in the elevator at the end of the day brother you will always be you,0.13215002
and I will always be me,0.055865977
you see Marvel is interested in these characters changing slightly you can make Thor funnier,0.106373
you can make the whole top but without real consequences without a proper balance in tone,0.06594878
Marvel is showing us that they're not really interested in these characters growing,0.123076506
yes this film is entertaining,0.119547896
I hear it all the time about Marvel films but you know what at this point,0.11445944
that's not enough,0.12172978
I was a little indifferent about Doctor Strange,0.053977046
I was a little indifferent about ant-man and you know what after Thor Ragnarok I think I'm out of free passes basically what I'm saying,0.1500723
Marvel is enough joking around as always let me know what you thought of thor ragnarok in the comments section below I would love to get a dialogue going even if you disagree a mature dialogue hopefully that can happen,0.10728984
