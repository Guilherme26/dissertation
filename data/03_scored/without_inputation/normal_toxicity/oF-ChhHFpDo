did I like this one,0.07784093
so the favorite is directed by Yorgos Lant the most I hope I got that right but known for the lobster the killing of a sacred deer all very weird very strange movies if you've seen any of them do you kind of know to expect the cast we've got Olivia Colman Emma Stone Rachel Weitz and Nicholas Hoult spectacular cast all these women phenomenal you couldn't have casted this movie any better your ghost I'm proud of you or whoever your caster is I should have looked that up whoever the casting Department is in this movie phenomenal job,0.20244417
so the story takes place in eighteenth-century England while England is currently at war with France at the time,0.1492003
its Queen and generally do much of the state governing herself she leaves a lot of it to her aide who was Lady Sarah Marlborough I'm gonna push that this entire episode or this entire review I'm sorry Sarah takes care of,0.1599978
all,0.036047194
the stuff err basically she's our right-hand lady and then Sarah's cousin Abigail who's Emma Stone shows up looking for work and she starts off as like a little as a maid cleaning stuff up and then eventually she kind of works her way up through the staff and then suddenly her and Sarah are fighting for the Queen's attention and her her loyalty and a lot of high jinks and bitterness and a lot ends up happening up front,0.10929503
if you've never seen a your ghost film killing of a sacred dear lobster or dog tooth,0.43905342
you might want to watch one of those to kind of prepare yourself you're going to be a little confused maybe a little uncomfortable,0.16045739
although this movie is probably the Thema swoon,0.12013373
he's made the old couple next,0.10272254
to me certainly did not know what they were getting into,0.09607336
and they were not fans,0.18248248
when he walked out this movie probably has is the most approachable the easiest one to digest but just know going in this is this is a his films are unique,0.13311683
and I think he this is the best one he's ever made for sure,0.07328723
so obviously,0.083613865
the best part of this movie is the chemistry between stone whites and Coleman,0.24661346
the three leading ladies are phenomenal the kind of cat-and-mouse game between whites and stone to get the admiration of Coleman there's just so much fun to watch you I'm sure the audiences are picking sides of who who they want to win out,0.3108402
and I wasn't bored at all during this movie I was it was a little bit slow at the beginning but it about twenty minutes and it really picks up and I just love the chemistry between it between the two of them,0.06741118
I couldn't wait to see what the next one would pull on the other one and Coleman is just,0.06527881
so she's just so good at what she does that woman this film is also so good in technical areas the production design is phenomenal the sets the costumes the way they speak all of the props they're using it it just feels it,0.10489755
I felt like I was in 18th century England for like two,0.07958756
and a half hours I walked out wanting to speak in a British accent I loved how this movie looked it's just so beautiful to look at this movie is just so well put together,0.1102619
you could feel like your ghost and his crew just expertly crafted and put together each of these pieces the music also so good I love the music in this movie it's so in time and it all just it all just builds into this experience and this feeling that it's trying to get across I think some people are gonna walk away hating this movie because the couple makes me certainly did because it is not obvious,0.14881147
it is there's a complex web of deceit,0.1713436
and the ending is probably gonna be controversial with some people because it does not beat you over the head with what it means you do have one con and it's that I mentioned,0.31470826
it earlier the movie does take about 20 to 25 minutes to really get going the beginning is kind of slow and you're kind of like,0.14006126
oh I really hope I'm not about to sit through two hours of British people talking to each other it gets so good once you kind of there's a there's a certain point and from that point on you understand what's what what the rest of this movie is gonna be about,0.19509764
and if you're not on at that point you're not gonna have a good time,0.27172455
but if you are like I was you're gonna have a great time going forward if you couldn't tell I am going to give the favor a 9 out of 10,0.18919165
this is definitely in my top 10 movies of 2018,0.06154103
I did not expect that at all,0.06731992
I wasn't really sure what I was expecting but I just I walked away loving this movie this is your ghost best film yet he put you can tell he he tried,0.15523627
so hard to make a perfect movie it's not quite perfect,0.19147722
it's not a ten but it's definitely as close as I think he can get that's what I thought about the favorite,0.08026134
