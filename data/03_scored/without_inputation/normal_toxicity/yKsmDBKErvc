black clansmen was directed by Spike Lee and stars,0.009930981
John David Washington as Ron Stallworth,0.07708872
and this is the outrageous true story about a police officer from Colorado played by John David Washington who decides to infiltrate the KKK and he does so by talking to them on the phone,0.085640416
but one of his fellow officers portrayed by Adam driver goes to them in person and acts as his surrogate while Ron talks to them on the phone and gets inside their heads,0.20924732
and so they're working undercover to try to figure out what they can learn about the KKK in the 1970s,0.09465181
and this is a completely insane based on a true story movie and I think Spike Lee's best film since Inside Man I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end,0.19183223
I thought it was riveting but most surprisingly very funny I really didn't expect that going in because I tried to stay away from the trailers I've been trying to do that lately where I I don't see too many of the trailers or or know much about the film going in,0.048485745
and I found that I enjoy films or at least,0.15332897
am surprised by films a lot more in doing that,0.06764093
so I was really taken aback by how hilarious this film actually is and how often I was laughing,0.14900075
a lot of it is due to the interplay between John David Washington and Adam driver then going back and forth trying to figure out how they're going to play each other one of them's on the phone the others in person,0.05787333
this is just such a great idea,0.0724682
and it's actually surprising the film hasn't been made up until now because not only is it a very relevant movie for today's times,0.043316197
it's just such a great story,0.026215617
and for this film Spike Lee has taken a considerably more mainstream approach,0.10952276
and I think that was a very wise decision,0.0642546
because this film needs to be seen by as many people as possible and to do,0.07367986
so you kind of have to adopt more of a crowd-pleasing element to your film even though the story is very dark,0.0878768
and in so doing I feel like a lot more,0.06123358
people are going to see this movie and a lot more,0.11789397
people are going to hear the message and understand its importance,0.1079425
there are some historical inaccuracies throughout the film and some things have been more embellished to create more of a theatrical experience,0.06087429
and I'm assuming that more than likely some people will find fault with that,0.06541963
and thus say this is a bad film or be angry about that but I've never really seen a based on a true story movie that doesn't in some way embellish things or try to make things more entertaining for an audience,0.090219185
and that's what this film does a few times and it didn't bother me I I never thought that it encroached upon his message,0.08280945
I never thought that it took away from the film I was constantly invested,0.060349394
and I had a great time watching it John David Washington I want to see more with him,0.05602218
there are many times throughout his performance,0.04787469
especially when he raises his voice where I was like wow you sound just like your father right now and it actually gave me goosebumps a little bit but he really did step out of what a lot of people might consider a shadow by being the son of Denzel Washington here he owned this role,0.15105325
he gave so much to it,0.065642565
he was impeccable his screen presence,0.10842137
he was on fire,0.27671102
this is a fantastic performance an atom driver as usual was magnificent all of the acting in the film especially for some of the KKK who I imagine were having a very difficult time saying and doing some of the things on screen they really committed to that role and despite how funny this movie actually is it somehow is able to balance the darkness with that light so beautifully,0.084822014
because there are scenes where I was almost in tears laughing,0.07539375
and then in the next I'm wincing there's a scene where one person tells a story about a horrific Allah violent act,0.4010263
and it made me sick to my stomach and like that's the power this film has the end credits in particular I was almost in tears,0.15036523
and and so there's a lot to like about this film really the only real issue,0.12454077
I can find with it that that bugged me throughout is that it is a little too long perhaps it's just there's a few scenes where the pacing isn't as good as it could be,0.063018076
but Spike Lee has balanced those tones of humor and darkness so beautifully and I think that's one of the most important things,0.081842326
you can look at when you watch a film is how the director has balanced the tone and it's just about perfect black clansmen is easily Spike Lee's best film in years and I'm gonna give it an a guys,0.12539802
