the shape of water is a film directed by Guillermo del Toro and also written by guillermo del toro he also did the screenplay for this movie it's a monster movie slash romance film it's kind of like Beauty and the Beast meets et it starts a woman named Sally Hawkins as the main character of Eliza it also stars other great talent like Octavia Spencer and Michael Shannon and Doug Jones as the creature in this monster movie so like I said Sally Hawkins plays a woman named Eliza Eliza is mute she can't speak she can't talk she works at this top-secret government facility with her friend Octavia Spencer as a cleaner and one day a mysterious creature is brought into the facility watched over by Michael Shan Lysa develops a connection with this creature she gets close to it she eventually starts falling in love with this creature and then she finds out that the creatures life might be in danger so she has to figure out a way to work with her friends to protect this creature and help it escape from its prison in this facility and Michael Shannon well he's not gonna be too happy about that one thing I've always loved about llamo del Toro and his films is his ability to visually paint a picture I mean this dude is one of the greatest visual storytellers that I've ever seen guys a master class at subtly and visually laying it out for you it's like a road map with filled with all kinds of emotion all kinds of subtext and all kinds of layers and visually you just got to see it with your eyes I mean the  is poetry on screen and this movie is no different because this is not only one of the best looking and gorgeous looking films of the entire year made a film that has a lot of visual subtext and a lot of visual storytelling that will go unnoticed unless you're actually paying attention it's not enough to say that this movie is eggs on a tip beautiful I mean duh of course it is Guillermo del Toro always has a beautiful looking movie I like what he did with the lighting and the contrasts in this film somehow it's a little bit more of a grounded reality in this film it takes place in the 1960s so it's not as much of a fantastical epic as you're used to seeing from guillermo del toro but somehow in a grounded fantasy it's still somehow manages to pop visually I'm not entirely sure how he and the cinematographer did that for this film but kudos to both of those guys Foreman says in this film are so goddamn good that I don't think it's enough for me to get out of this review and not say that every single one of the main principle characters and actors in this film need to be nominated for something give a damn if it's a Golden Globe I don't give a damn if it's an Oscar I don't care if someone just draws a picture of a golden statue and a piece of paper and hands it to them and says you were awesome because guess what everybody in this movie was freaking awesome Sally Hawkins was mesmerizing as the main character of Eliza she doesn't say anything in the movie she can't talk obviously because she's mute but her facial reactions and her eyes tell everything they tell the entire story all I can really say about her performance in this movie is that she moves mountains emotionally without saying a single word everyone else was really great in the movie to Octavia Spencer I mean she just adds something to every movie that she's in she has some very funny parts she has some very welcome levity and human though she brought some humor there's also some very touching and heartfelt moments with her character too and I would say that her character just like most of the other characters in this film are trying to find themselves in someone else they're trying to find some part of themselves trying to find something that they've lost within themselves and they're trying to see it reflected in someone else her character represents that too Jones is great as this amphibian sea creature monster whatever the hell this thing is prosthetics and the design of the creature are very well done and Doug Jones does a lot of miming and a lot of hand movements and a lot of eye twitches and I decided to describe and all I can know is that Doug Jones was great in this movie Michael Shannon oh my god to do is just I hate him in this movie Michael Sata does such a great job at playing a great villain we have seen that in other films that he's done but in this movie in particular he was such a slimeball oh my god I absolutely hated Michael Shannon in this movie I hated him I just I despised him at a cellular level he was awful he was disgusting he made me sick to my stomach but I I just I couldn't turn away from the screen while he was on it even though this is a film that seems like it has a simple issue story to it it's a romance between a monster and a girl who can't speak it seems kind of simple but there are so many layers and themes and subtext interwoven throughout the narrative of the script and the screenplay that just make this movie pop on a more emotional level and on a more so Libra level than your typical Beauty meets the Beast type of story there are some very subtle references in ways that the film brings up and addresses things that are not only prevalent in our society today but we're also prevalent during that era in the 1960s there are some heavy themes about prejudice about judging somebody who's different than you subconscious prejudices that we have about people even what we don't say anything it also says a lot about people with disabilities and the way we take people like that for granted and the way that sometimes not saying things is sometimes the most powerful statement that a person can make a real issue with this movie is that the movie does hit a lull sometime between the second act and the third act there's a point in the movie where the story is going along and then something happens and then the story just kind of stops for a little bit and there's a little bit of a lull there's not much going on from a story perspective it's not that the story comes to a crashing halt it's just kind of like a plane circling overhead it's just it's it's hovering it's not really going anywhere there's a little nitpick is that I wish we had found out a little bit more about age sapien look at him look at the fish thing in this movie and tell me that that doesn't seem like it's a prequel or whatever the it's supposed to be for ape Sapien from the Hellboy movies come on I mean it's it's so obvious plus it's played by the same guy who was Abe Sapien in the Hellboy movies maybe I'm reaching but I don't think I am the shape of water is one of the most touching beautiful visually ematic Lee awesome movies that I have seen in 2017 this movie touched me and it touched me everywhere it touched me in my brain it touched me in my heart all that said I am going to give the shape of water Superman Prime as I absolutely loved this movie you need to go
