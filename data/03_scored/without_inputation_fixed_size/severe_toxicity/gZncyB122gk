hello youtubers this is Sheridan Davis again and welcome to pretty dicey and girls PG,0.063410625
ok I am coming today to do a movie review for the film Selma iris,0.044322517
lee it came out maybe two weeks ago I think everybody should go out to,0.040334743
see this movie I get an A and the direct I loved her work she,0.043836266
is also the one she speeds up and slows down things I love it so,0.059711542
make sure you guys go out and see something i have on a coat because,0.08913328
I'm so um anyway so everybody go see summer it was very good now when,0.03282548
you go see make sure you have tissues ready honey cuz i cried and i'm,0.14088057
not one of those people just cry at movies a lot behind I was in,0.11665259
tears the first five minutes of this film like I was like bad when you,0.056800697
like that man in tears like the first time thinking like maybe I shouldn't do,0.049573477
this review but then I thought yes I should it its history it's not like,0.043810327
I'm selling a film yeah by the ship pretty much caught what happened so anyway,0.036204614
what one thing that idea learned about the film is that they highlighted the women,0.05046083
in the movement so like obviously Chris got King this Nash Ralph Abernathy is wife,0.089783825
you know things people liked it so I was super excited that she um that,0.08195395
they highlighted the women because i oftentimes when you hear about civil rights like we,0.14255019
only think about the me and plus rosa parks slider and there were other women,0.07280302
who were involved in this struggle and in history you know with these marches and,0.016333584
things of that nature and sometimes even if they weren't on the front lines they,0.023857476
were organizers they were getting ideas they're giving the talents all that so i think,0.043931387
we often we do need to give them their activation and who are not dr.,0.05920733
king give him them Escalades as well you know not to take anything from him,0.12462415
but he wasn't after about himself so I think it's amazing to just give these,0.03884872
people highlight them if you say it was so much action in this film but,0.03678
it will make you because of where we are now in history it'll make you,0.028737929
appreciate where we are be grateful for those who have come before us and it'll,0.024079649
make you know that we can't overcome like we have made some get strikes in,0.08093888
this country we have a lot more to do so it made me appreciate feel,0.048545767
it made me know that the air gardeners Trayvon Martin my ground situations that we,0.025294939
cannot become them too and I know that we have had a difficult past with,0.023429098
racism in this country you know with I watched it with my best friend and,0.3088546
we were sitting there thinking like man God truly it's awesome because he clearly selects,0.066795744
when we were all born like he chooses the right people to be worn at,0.08756078
the right time because i was thinking like if i were born during that time,0.069713905
when I have been able to march with them like what I have been able,0.035542093
to like stay in that race like what I have been able to be nonviolent,0.23551454
I don't think I'd have been able to do that I don't know if I,0.039464682
would have had the courage to be able to not slap a police officer at,0.08519938
ease let me or tonight um you know challenge a police officer who called me,0.16416334
girl and now i'ma 40 year old woman you know so I think those things,0.198548
are really important just to see like how far we have them and like it's,0.023152381
just crazy to me to think about the fact that man beast is not just,0.07731296
a movie that's not just a story that came out of someone's butt this is,0.39563107
history this stuff really heavy and it didn't happen that long ago because these folks,0.024716228
are still alive like a lot of you people are still alive to talk about,0.12397959
what they did and some of them weren't kids like 16 17 18 years old,0.08077192
and for them to have their college at that type of them to have that,0.02732774
courage to march and not just to march and that's one thing i love about,0.03916202
this that error they weren't just marching to be marching because i found that a,0.026876746
lot of us are marching to be marching but we didn't march they talk to,0.011532954
legislators they were talking to people who can actually make differences like if you're marching,0.03133015
with nothing Andy no um no attention all media attention no attention from your government,0.04237752
where they flip state local or federal we're just taking a walk and saying nothing,0.06363945
talking about saying nothing but I love that they have some force behind them they,0.13520457
were talking to the president they had something they had some but there's nothing else,0.045686807
I can take away from this family it's something that the Bible says faith when,0.068166025
our works is dead so no we're not just marching but we're marching for change,0.047694996
and we're not just march and we're getting everybody involved and i also look because,0.021922458
we cannot in school these days we are off we kind of thought that everybody,0.03899905
was with dr. King on Malcolm X and that is not how it went lips,0.02635391
and I history way and if you go back and research you'll find that you,0.04220191
know we always talk about black people being United and you know everybody has a,0.24023923
different mind it was not going to think like you and so there were several,0.055618
leaders right several leaders different races different sexes different colors I don't everybody one way,0.11209675
dr. King if I did not agree with dr. king he was not the spokesman,0.038154934
for the entire Negro race there were other leaders but i did use him you,0.6238346
know despite his flaws and his moral issues God used him mightily and I think,0.118487164
that's a great thing to point out I want to have his daughter you know,0.13411565
so she was at the Opera screening of this film I wonder how she felt,0.053508036
watching this you know it can't I mean he is deceased iris lee but it,0.1456526
can't be a good feeling to know that the FBI has you know half pounds,0.04305401
of your father shooting on your mother like I wonder have that feels is there,0.6479949
a filament he's being passed along I wonder if her mother and we talked to,0.11518054
them about it was there something that or if she ever dealt with it or,0.03365164
is it something that she just like trying to like not talk about not deal,0.046224277
with in order to say the movement and what to keep her family you know,0.13386023
because she could have left I wonder how this my history would have been had,0.046211638
these wonder who are on the front line with their hello who were fighting with,0.039236523
their heads when during these movements and their husbands were stepping out on them I,0.1396267
wonder how different history would have been if those one would have left them because,0.0231597
they had grounds to leave them I wonder how and being like it's careta diverse,0.049503632
nothing like what we have been able to what he still had been used as,0.033553194
he was like when he still had been a prominent figure that he looked i,0.031795114
really wonder it so I don't know it was a really great movie I think,0.04312053
everybody needs to go see all the african-american me to go see it man forget,0.37750384
about I don't want to see the word stand black movies like honestly honestly there,0.25831354
are not the Moon moves out about our history we don't make that any movies,0.028423963
period through the year so we need to go see it and supply if we,0.026528854
want these actors to stay in Hollywood we want Holly watch your continued to an,0.05988848
hour store everything we need to go support our people and let me say this,0.07990252
as well I am so disappointed in the Academy Awards I am not watching it,0.02613307
I am not watching it for there to be no people of color nominated for,0.33868274
their acting I think that is utterly ridiculous data or yellow desirable nomination for this,0.13878459
movie as far as I'm concerned so that the young man who play I who,0.03064102
play a James Brown you know there were other movies who are deserving of Oscar,0.020395195
nominations they had oscar-worthy performance if nothing else James Brown will should have been nominated,0.06479687
for a costume and makeup honestly I am disappointed Academy Awards you guys I'm horrible,0.11836344
animation up since it's a hug it's a racial ballgame period point blank because you're,0.26561934
kind of saying then no african-american no Asian American or Latino American actors and actresses,0.19184361
our desire of ice cuz this year's no matter how how good of performances they,0.029063204
cool during the box offices or on the big screen I do not appreciate it,0.045478605
so Academy I can go sit down I will not be watching out this year,0.04969055
I hope that I only hope that Selma Texas the way this oscar for best,0.08189209
friend but it's not and um it should have been nominated for best director as,0.03372614
well but whatever i'm not doing this we can take away yet i'm just not,0.03735339
