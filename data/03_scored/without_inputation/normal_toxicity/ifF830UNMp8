what's up guys,0.10309566
my name is,0.018398073
Aaron today,0.021260107
I'm going to be reviewing Dunkirk Dunkirk is the latest movie by Christopher Nolan basically like a retelling of the Meza,0.09896754
actually happened in Dunkirk World War two and it stars,0.12111268
Tom Hardy Killian Murphy Mark Rylance Kenneth Branagh and a lot of different actors and stuff it's moving I'm not like a huge Chris foreknown fan I do think he's a really good director definitely one of the best but I don't know if I like personally connect to his movies like I do a lot of directors like of his generation like Paul Thomas Anderson David Fincher Sofia Coppola,0.31715587
I don't know if I really connect with this movie so much as those people but I do think he's a really talented director I think that movies like The Dark Knight,0.13362142
and the prestige is definitely classics to me,0.054534215
he's made like a lot of important movies in the past,0.074471615
so I do think he's a really respected director,0.07265096
so in that he has his hands on,0.11059585
I'm going to give it a watch because he's that even that talented to me what I didn't expect was just to be like one,0.14927395
my favorite Nolan movies I really wasn't that high for this,0.09554906
but I was just only surprised I think this is really good what I do like about,0.053061336
this is like the actual atmosphere of the movie it really puts you in these soldiers shoes and stuff like that feels really authentic to the time like the costumes the weapons that they use though vehicle that they use even including like the planes of stuff like that it all feels like like you're in that time period like I feel like a cuties in that way that it honestly looks like it was actually made in the 40s or 50s like it doesn't feel like a modern movie and that's kind of in a good way the sound design is really immersive like it really puts you in the soldier shoes and stuff like that,0.09368025
and it really makes you feel what they're feeling like I was like really tense the entire time I was watching the movie and that's a really good job with the sound design,0.069220625
I guess what movie it just really puts you in their shoes,0.08230746
I really like those 10 scenes that really focus on like the soldiers trying to navigate how to get out of the situation after in like the beginning works just like super wordless and there's no talking,0.08331268
but it's like in this like house I can away from my peoples might be out himself like that it feels really like heightened and it really puts you in that solder shoes without really like telling you what is happening,0.106505685
so like that you just really figure out as he's going along and stuff and it really puts you in his shoes,0.17418145
the other thing I like what's going to be a lot like it didn't really like explain who these people were,0.1475621
and what they were doing before they had the war and stuff like that like with a lot of war movies they really try to do that like character description and stuff,0.10940779
like that I really feel like they're truly trying to make you relate to them,0.051910102
what you always say oh I had a wife or whatever like that before I came out here,0.1596978
and just like we know this stuff,0.05691903
I don't need to rehash the type of things that I feel like an actual war situation like that you really want to be talking about that type of stuff,0.13415585
but you would just be trying to get the help out of there,0.07324999
and that's really what this movie try to convey it's like it really makes you feel like this is how you would actually act,0.073015586
a war like running away trying to save people,0.18100935
so that not really thinking about yourself in the situation like it's just you just really are just trying to get out of this situation,0.16236602
so like that and that moves we really conveys that with a different on ways of the child approach that with the land like the soldier that was trying to get away by the sea lettuce innocence or trying to save people and buy hair wear the soldier is trying to shoot down targets of like the kind of help to people on his side and stuff like that you really do get a sense of what these people are trying to do without the movie sitting down and explaining that to us and I do appreciate no one for doing that aspect of the movie I do think the theme a movie is basically like survival of what you will do in the situations like that the movie does that,0.11389016
without really telling you that the theme of the movie is else is what I got for the movie and it really kind of shows you that with the two soldiers on the land Tommy,0.05491834
so like beyond Whitehead is kind of like the good-good nature side of severe evil war,0.24232256
he's trying to do the right thing and trying to help people in a situation as much as he can,0.068215124
and then it's kind of on the flip side with Alex,0.09471241
so by Harry Styles who is really just trying to look out for himself and just try to get out the situation as best as he can I thought that the two actors really did a good job trying to convey their different modes of that,0.06692356
and it really felt really authentic,0.029691862
and I was real surprised by their acting,0.08712563
and I really really surprised by Harry Styles I was like,0.051586196
why is Christopher Nolan getting Harry Styles to be in a serious movie but he does a really good job,0.08416197
it was a little bit distracting,0.24619055
but first because you're just like that's Harry Styles in a war movie this is weird but it is a really good job with his character,0.14633994
I think the veteran actors like Tom Hardy Kenneth Branagh killing and Murphy and Mark violence they do a lot of stuff with their roles even though they're not in the movie a lot those actors really did a lot with a minimal light dialogue,0.26848584
they had I really think that Harry Styles actually had the most dialogue this movie which is really good to say you know Christopher Nolan movie but the actors all did a really good job with the worlds that they were given we would look like a lot of dialogue to any of them,0.09650783
what if this is like a perfect movie these aren't like major problems amoeba trees with some things that I had like I thought that the sea part of the movie which is kind of focused on more islands character wasn't as gripping as a other part,0.20673908
you can feel as urgent as like the land stuff or the air stuff,0.0793093
it isn't really pushing in there as much as those parts of movies did,0.07014705
and I think that kind of slowed down the pacing on the movie have time to look at that,0.08220457
but I guess I was the problem the movie and I do get the importance of it but it just kind of slowed down,0.072981164
my enjoyment I guess it's kind of thrown out of pace I also think that the way that he approached a story that kind of focusing on these three separate narrative the land the sea and the air was interesting and it really kind of real off-guard like you would be in these situations,0.07699084
but I just felt like at times it felt kind of gimmicky to me and it felt like I don't know like it kind of was just a little bit too sentimental especially was like the sea part of the movie but overall,0.09142889
I think this is a really great movie,0.06545066
I don't know what the replay value of this is going to be like,0.08647485
I don't know I would probably watch this again,0.13638984
I'm outside is like a maybe in theatre,0.07782307
so I don't think I probably watched like a whole or whatever like that am i doing,0.09906126
this is a really great movie with donating like technical aspects like this movie looks gorgeous especially during the air parts of movies,0.06811256
I do think that acting is really good,0.067228235
and the theme is really clear-cut without it being too preachy anything like that,0.1284788
but I do think that the pacing is kind of off in some parts and I do think that the narrative is kind of gimmicky at points overall,0.08939921
I'll give us an 8 out of 10,0.14933796
I definitely think this is probably one of no-one's best movies but I'll probably have to go over my ranking,0.08185077
but I think this is probably my top three no our movies,0.07230292
so yeah those are my thoughts on Dunkirk,0.0823151
what do you guys,0.07031446
thought did you like it did you hate it,0.4194331
