now it's time to move on to more important stuff farewell is a movie that,0.054385737
is directed by Lulu Wang or Lulu Wong I think it's Lulu Wang it stars,0.07220273
aquafina and Zima Azim I still know him as Chang from 24th rat-bastard the concept,0.69542736
behind the story is kind of interesting aquafina stars as a young woman who's been,0.10245561
living in america for a while now she and her parents actually had been living,0.12646602
in America for over 20 years they she gets the very bad news that her,0.26758108
grandmother the matriarch of the family is dying and she's not going to be around,0.35525867
anymore she's suffering from some kind of cancer or something she also finds out that,0.31089434
the rest of her family has decided not to tell the grandmother that she's dying,0.38257948
they all know that she's dying she doesn't know that she's dying and no one,0.41087398
else in the family is going to tell her kind of wedding that's planned in,0.077865966
China and this is really just an excuse to get the family together so that,0.07101177
they could say goodbye basically to the grandmother again does not know that she is,0.10015296
dying but everyone else knows that she is and they have to try to keep,0.194832
this from her and this becomes a bigger moral issue for everyone in the family,0.11435881
the longer the film goes on I like movies where I can go into a,0.053627938
movie and there's a sense of discovery with it because I discovered some things while,0.072360486
watching this movie mostly that I'm an ignorant American who doesn't understand how other cultures,0.6619899
work I appreciate films that show me that other side of the culture that I'm,0.12763664
missing that show me how other people do things and how that's different from the,0.114064984
way Americans think and the way that Americans do things on something the premise of,0.15104243
this movie it just seems weird to American ears I saw the movie and I'm,0.15670285
like okay I don't get why they're not telling this woman that she's sick like,0.76823866
wouldn't it make better sense to tell this woman so that you can prepare for,0.26313245
us that everybody can build it up everybody can say goodbye and she can feel,0.05669716
like she you know she got a chance to say goodbye this movie showed me,0.07973813
a different side a different angle to that question it actually did present this as,0.043565616
an actual moral dilemma in the movie not just for Aquafina character but for the,0.054577116
rest of the family in between those complicated family dynamics and the moral issue of,0.068794645
telling somebody whether or not they're going Dyanne whether that's going to affect the experience,0.054665696
of spending your last moments with them it's really the emotional hook that got itself,0.2520399
into me and kept me watching this movie because I gotta say this is one,0.15114029
of my favorite film experiences of the year and it's a film experience I did,0.024866188
not expect going in as an American we're used to saying goodbye we're used to,0.074079834
it being a very emotional drawn-out thing but this movie also does a very good,0.09816678
job at pointing out some differences between the culture of America and the West and,0.14976089
the culture of you know the east and some of the countries and places out,0.14156462
there America it's all about you it's all about doing what's best for you and,0.10086274
doing what's best for yourself it's all about individualism and it's all about expression it's,0.07797291
all about being an individual there are the ease they have a different mentality everything,0.1856728
that they do is it's like one person is a part of a bigger whole,0.13381018
it's basically they're all for their family and all for society look at themselves as,0.104645945
part of a cog in the system just fascinating to get inside that system and,0.04211749
see how their minds work look at the way that some people look at it,0.074208915
from the eastern side of things they're kind of like well actually you were part,0.06776748
of a whole we're supposed to carry that grief for them so that they don't,0.06810131
have to so that's why we decided not to tell them about like the fact,0.06026957
that this movie reflected this is a very balanced issue because honestly it's an issue,0.1540731
that has a lot of Merit to both sides say this is one of the,0.057167962
most compelling watches of the years it's not just about this film and the themes,0.07653193
and the ideas that it's dealing with but also the emotion and the family at,0.029766472
its core it's a movie that could have been about so many things in fact,0.084948026
in a lot of ways it is about a lot of things but it kept,0.051160146
its focus on the things that mattered the shoutout Aquafina aquafina was sensational in this,0.09485576
movie normally when I see Aquafina in a movie I'm like okay he's just there,0.10395077
to be the funny person she's just there to carry the comic relief portion know,0.11974759
in this movie she wasn't just the funny person like her character had a lot,0.16877326
of depth to her character had a lot of range and as an actress she,0.053682353
displayed that range in full display for everybody to see performance like this definitely makes,0.048168
me more interested to see Aquafina and more serious dramatic roles because she definitely proved,0.12815806
in this movie she can pull it off all the performances in the movie feel,0.07122472
very real all of the writing for these characters feels very authentic the film that,0.05163211
also has gorgeous lighting and cinematography I don't know if it was shot on location,0.18340133
but I like the fact that they made everything look really beautiful in this movie,0.0922782
especially when they were in China whether or not to tell somebody whether they're dying,0.21145365
and what that will do for you and what that will do for them how,0.06926769
the characters in this movie don't know how to react around this woman because they,0.2417766
know that she's gonna die now there's an undercurrent of tension and emotion woven into,0.49127418
every scene because every character that's in a scene with her feels like this is,0.12245827
one of their final scenes one of their final times they're ever going to get,0.05631625
to spend with really appreciated the direction and the approach by the director I really,0.029842837
appreciated the execution of the performances the musical score the cinematography mostly I appreciate that,0.102252394
they took a concept like this and they made it something that I can understand,0.0842707
something that I can dissect from multiple perspectives and I like movies that give me,0.08292661
that sense of discovery give me that sense of perspective that I didn't have before,0.0726859
really have minor nitpicks with the film I do think that it got off to,0.076763004
kind of a slow start like in the first 20 minutes it took me a,0.15072466
little bit to get invested in things do you think later on in the film,0.083477676
there are some scenes that dry going a little bit unnecessarily there is a wedding,0.08606283
scene that takes place somewhere close to the third act of this movie just went,0.08096324
on for a little bit too long it felt a little bit self-indulgent I'm gonna,0.3640127
say farewell to the farewell and I'm gonna put it where it belongs on this,0.07303481
