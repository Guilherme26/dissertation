this movie started up so well and crashed and burned right in front of my,0.2969467
face oh goodness so first offer after bad anyone who tells you that this movie,0.039298385
was amazing was great um they're lying to you I was expecting this wouldn't be,0.07567927
good and it wasn't this is probably one of the worst Marvel Studios films that,0.076181486
I've seen I would probably give that award to to Thor Ragnarok but the redeeming,0.037862252
Grace about Thor Ragnarok is that you know add the millions of jokes they had,0.015417626
on display there were actually a couple that were funding that I kind of giggled,0.031999324
that this however has all the bad of thor ragnarok but without the humor there's,0.035910603
the I mean there's like bits and pieces of humor where they tried but it,0.05975012
was just like no it was a Miss so let's get into it that the,0.048332907
movie starts off amazing they tell the history of of will condign how the Black,0.16838126
Panther came to be and all the five tribes and everything I'm just like yo,0.047482803
this this is it was amazingly done I was like you know they managed to,0.040039398
wrap all that up in about a few seconds I was like this movies about,0.08596301
to be good Marvel Studios comes on so the movie starts off right it kind,0.07450922
of like in the middle of of Civil War where he hid where his father,0.044927835
dies and now he becomes king starts off with this scene the process of process,0.1716493
of how he becomes king and it's very much kind of like how it's done,0.041224755
in the jungle with the lines where you know if he had the headline and,0.03786159
if no one challenges the headline well he remains the headline if someone challenges him,0.027030403
and you know and he went well this guy's a new the new headline the,0.0350911
head of the head of the head of the the tribe or if he concedes,0.25181553
well then he remains the headline it's usually to the death based off the you,0.17183356
know the Discovery Channel so what happens is they ask all the tribes Bhiwandi you,0.086212456
know do we have a challenger to chawla everyone concedes no we don't have a,0.052682545
challenge no we don't have a challenger and one the other when the other tribes,0.059727505
are the mountain they have a challenger so they fight it out and T'Challa ends,0.05188499
up winning just by an inch by inch he wins and he becomes king now,0.06349843
when it comes to the costume I know I was bitching and moaning about the,0.46677443
costume and you know what it after seen the movie I don't have a problem,0.024984963
with the new costume and the reason why is because we barely see it there,0.02046637
is a problem with Marvel films and this was most pertinent in the spider-man series,0.03727556
is where they have every five seconds they have to remove the super ass remove,0.61454874
his mask I'm like yo I didn't come here to see the actor I came,0.079881236
here to see Black Panther every five seconds you know his he's taking off his,0.22522213
mask whether it's digital or he's constantly removing it so when it comes to the,0.073263995
action in this movie you would think for a movie titled Black Panther we would,0.23808524
see more of the black panther in action um sadly we do not I think,0.050355066
there's like maybe four for action pieces the first part is the one where he's,0.032431696
in the jungle that was horribly filmed I understand that it's black and that his,0.09453856
suit is black so that makes it hard for bad people to see him but,0.41321927
as an audience member that makes it hard for me to see him as well,0.055590063
so it's black on black on black literally and I'm like I don't know what's,0.47341976
going on in the theater I don't know what's what's happening on screen I can't,0.022885643
see anything one thing I do like about the film is that you know everyone,0.021655053
is strong everyone has a sense of pride in a sense of character like he,0.027685609
goes in to save this girl that he likes which in the trailer they said,0.07467418
you know don't freeze he of course freezes in front of her you know like,0.06731858
his crush or whatever but she you know as soon as she gets that second,0.1230184
to escape captivity she does and she's paying on BAM like these women are trained,0.14423509
as a matter of fact my favorite character throughout the entire movie wasn't even to,0.022749946
chala it has to be his his guard the the bald headed woman who's like,0.29705885
the protector like she is more dedicated to Wakanda than he is and she's more,0.068563804
of a strong and justjust a strong and powerful character like how she's I don't,0.0319348
even say how she's written but how she's portrayed on screen how she does it,0.023451714
it's like help you do not want to mess with this woman I'd rather see,0.29186475
her as Black Panther ten to Charla and I'm gonna tell you why as I,0.14987984
go on in this review so the whole story arc of Black Panther is surrounds,0.1567319
about Jordan P Jordan B's character in Jordan these characters essentially two challahs father on,0.033895764
his brother goes to America sleeps with a woman apparently the white woman because Jordan,0.32006362
he's pretty light and has Jordan B's character the child's father comes comes to America,0.025639504
and confronts him because you know Jordan B's father was selling vibranium and Jordan B's,0.063202426
father his whole ideas you know we need to rise up you know we need,0.07363583
to supply all the blacks with weaponry that we have and we need to control,0.5512119
the world and then by our hand we give out justice that's what he wants,0.060833704
he wants to control the world so long story short Andy's character makes his way,0.024992945
back to Wakanda I'm not sure how he makes his way back to Wakanda because,0.0612255
who he was dependent upon on finding his way there um he kills and that,0.15358359
was Andy Serkis character the claws he straight kills him before he even gets the,0.429887
directions to Wakanda whatever will bypass that she Jordan B comes back to a condom,0.27747563
with Andy Serkis his character the claw I'm dead he lays it at the the,0.21608357
doorsteps of Wakanda so the big thing about Andy Serkis is character claw is that,0.05002181
T'Challa was supposed to be going to America to get Claude to bring him back,0.051875677
in order to serve justice it's in order for his trial to be had and,0.09515718
you know he promises one of the other members of the tribe who Klaw killed,0.2973281
he killed I think of is his family his mother father or something like that,0.569201
he's like yo are you gonna bring him back because every one every black panther,0.45778355
including you is said they're gonna do something they have it and to tell us,0.024870552
like I got you I got you I'm gonna bring him back and he's gonna,0.13531698
serve you no justice I promise you that he comes up in D empty-handed right,0.1594066
he comes back sorry he slipped through my hands um which is why it makes,0.04047975
it so important that Jordan be he ends up killing him and brings him back,0.54741406
to a kind of like you know I brought him back your King can do,0.053735532
it I did she draw in B's characters like I want the throne and I,0.022919567
want to fight you in order to get the throne because that's how it's done,0.20695327
and you know touch Allah accepts thing is apparently you can challenge the king at,0.047704976
any point in time regardless of when they're having the tournament or not but whatever,0.021312485
that's neither here or there so they get to fighting right and in Jordan B's,0.02097723
character he wins now listen to me he wins he ends up killing T'Challa he's,0.38265145
them picks him up and throws him off he went he's rightfully the king everyone's,0.14251293
devastated all oh my god he's the king I can't believe this we've got to,0.04100325
do something about we got to do something about this and I'm like wait what,0.03595983
do you what do you mean you have to do something about this by your,0.04253051
own rules that you have in place he rightfully won I'd understand a few was,0.04439968
he did something fair he be had the you know Black Panthers power prior to,0.17137127
the fight um but no he fair and square one so I don't so bake,0.043501016
they're completely about to undermine everything old Black Panthers history the culture the heritage all,0.178967
that undermine it all because they don't like who rightfully is in power not only,0.063997984
that but Jordan B you said you know that the flour that they take it,0.022376113
in order to become to get the powers of the Black Panther Jordan be is,0.024027098
like he'll burn it burn it all and she's like look we can't do that,0.52043283
he's like you know don't you ever holes are up bad throws like don't you,0.22994421
ever tell me what I can and can't do I'm King you burn it all,0.44034797
so they burn it all and I'm thinking to myself you want to tell me,0.29552025
the most advanced country on the face of the planet has no contingency within their,0.21049337
constitution in regards to stopping or thwarting a dictatorship that's what you want to tell,0.062386245
me ok then I start thinking about it I'm like hold up all the kings,0.09216119
and power all they've managed to demonstrate that they they have a physical ability of,0.02526301
physical superiority over everyone else that's it that's all you that's all it is you,0.20839871
have to do nor they continue to become a super hero is orange is the,0.04047842
the fight that's it there's no you know tests of mine no wisdom none of,0.036610376
that just you just have to you just have to be physically more domineering than,0.15940927
everyone else I'm like yo that's this Point Blank game stupid and the reason why,0.46087012
it's stupid is case in point Gordon B's character so moving on the mountain tribe,0.37699547
defines a two challahs body and they have them in preservation the family you know,0.18268006
chitara and the sister and everything and his girlfriend all leave and go to the,0.16181922
tribe go to the mountain king and they they offer him they offer him the,0.07948745
the powers of the Black Panther so they are really just crapping on everything that,0.4210996
what Wakanda in the Black Panther stands for they're about to offer a rival tribe,0.07669035
of the powerful Black Panther so the dude is like yo come here let me,0.098979995
show you like here's here's your king here's the child this is who he is,0.028664758
so they give to child the the the medicine of the super powers of the,0.046030045
Black Panther and he wakes up and everything he's like yo okay Simon settle things,0.20576125
I'm like hold up hold up here you can't give him the medicine of the,0.038102385
Black Panther because he lost technically by law he should be dead that's that's it,0.49426505
so this whole idea about what Condor forever we understand from akanda it's all bull,0.06667735
crap because you don't care about what Conda or the laws that they have in,0.4656874
place or the culture because you don't like it that the man that you wanted,0.11274198
to win when the win the fight and all that is now dethroned is now,0.04035935
essentially dead so you guys are willing to to bypass everything history history of your,0.20207348
people in order to put this man to chala back in power and T'Challa isn't,0.05923061
really that big of a king he's not even he's a weak King in my,0.21025656
opinion they managed to cut to China because throughout the history throughout the film they're,0.046324056
battling with this this idea of you know I move a condo or more advanced,0.042710777
we should be able to help people of other countries help our people who are,0.03971346
in the country and we're 2 tallis like y'all know that's that's not our job,0.055029314
that's our responsibility i am king of two I'm king of Wakanda and my job,0.040733185
is for the wakandan people I have no problem I get that he's absolutely right,0.12366961
but even if he did want to help other people war or less privileged than,0.04915707
him then he you know there's other means to do it you just don't cuz,0.040354695
in the movie in the movie I know I'm jumping ahead so so going back,0.019183232
to where I was T'Challa comes back and join me Peterson he's like yo did,0.059754778
the fight all of that determining who's King that's all over to tell us I,0.09500951
go I'm still alive and I didn't concede I didn't concede so the battle so,0.046272837
long so they did the Queen that not the Queen the the the warrior later,0.051910933
she's like yo did the fight is still on technically by the law of the,0.058217537
land by our law the fight is along Jordan B's character looks to the dude,0.027188051
remember the the tribe guy who got his parents killed by cloth he looks at,0.34759918
him as like yo kill T'Challa the Duke goes and does it I'm like there's,0.68054
nobody care about the law or what Conda in the Black Panther tribe like oh,0.14942685
this is just like just a free-for-all all it takes is one person I'm just,0.032290675
like this is crazy this is Magnus because technically the fight should still be on,0.08117369
they should have their fight and make it happen this do goes off and starts,0.08398941
fighting uh T'Challa and their tribe so there's absolute craziness on-screen so because you had,0.15007408
this whole tribe trying to fight a T'Challa and to Charles defending and trying to,0.06199046
stop the ships from going out because Jordan B is like yo sind send the,0.0751305
weaponry through Vance wedding ring to these people we have spies in every country send,0.08442444
them out and let's get this revolution started and to child's like no you can't,0.084714465
have that so he's trying to stop them while fighting the tribe and all of,0.09150533
this and then I'm just like then they have I kid you not they bring,0.103375524
out CGI rhinos and they have rhinos attacking their own people so I'm like yo,0.29648954
did the director - the scriptwriter do they not think this through they had black,0.23946305
people attacking black people I'm like even OMA conduct this black-on-black crime come on so,0.73667246
the fight slows down and - child's sister starts fighting torn beasts character in the,0.30318627
child sister and as his love interest and Jordan B is in the middle of,0.10489281
about to kill - child sister T'Challa that's when he jumps he's like no and,0.66182834
he stops him and then we we are we are just words can't describe just,0.023796946
that the the weakness of this film it is so all the hype that was,0.034336116
put behind this film this climax scene between Jordan B's character and T'Challa it's just,0.034942098
that it was so just just we cuckoo came up with this this is this,0.14824416
fight scene was garbage I was severely upset watching this fight scene so wrapping this,0.38327435
all up Jordan be a character ends up dying how I have no idea cuz,0.08494195
the last time I checked the Black Panther potion tears you of any of any,0.07808657
harm or any bruises or scars or wounds it cures you so I'm like you,0.22935112
have superpowers so I'm not sure how he dies whatever they let him die we,0.478026
wrapping this up we're wrapping this up and T'Challa comes out he goes to the,0.067297295
UN he's like yo we're here we're gonna help basically he's talking about build bridges,0.03579087
not walls all this whoopty whoop all this crap I'm like hold up no no,0.5252721
no no no no No you want to tell me because his girl his his,0.12284412
love in trees is like kill makanda is fall enough to protect ourselves and help,0.47095835
others I'm like obviously the hell you aren't you had one person drawing these character,0.3402756
one guy completely undermine everything completely oh just turn your whole country upside down on,0.14333577
its head one person you want to tell me that a country that the entire,0.07905641
nation finds out that Africa has this vibranium most one the most powerful and you,0.10538172
know allies resources of the world don't the planet and then you're just gonna sit,0.048626255
idly by and let what conduct hand it out well you get this and we're,0.092952095
gonna help you here no of course not that's gonna start a war so like,0.17046727
the hell with Wakanda and all that and as I was saying about the child,0.47570172
being a weak-ass leader he is a weak-ass leader they they freaking cocked I can't,0.76396686
believe what I'm saying they come they manage to cook the Black Panther they manage,0.29178897
to cut one the strongest most Alpha characters in the Marvel Universe they manage to,0.032757632
cut this man this dude was all about him and his people and making sure,0.25678718
they survive and they cut this dude because he's not even a strong enough character,0.10389703
a he barely wins the first fight the second fight he dies he loses that,0.18286164
fight the only way even comes back if it was through the power of of,0.11177746
them just completely crapping on the laws of the land so I'm like I eat,0.20651424
all of this and then he goes and just leaves open his people talking about,0.080654845
bridges not walls to two possible attacks inevitable attacks this movie was garbage just straight,0.362557
garbage anyone who talks about this movie being great and everything you have no sense,0.48510072
of taste you have no respect for yourself and you're just saying it because it's,0.28258654
black panther anyways guys that's the video limit oh you guys see one that I,0.26942858
