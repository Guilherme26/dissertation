and played by Olivia Colman she's struggling to figure out what to do with the war in France,0.1214522
were there Parliament and the Prime Minister's Rachel Weisz pretty much makes all the decisions for her because he's always ill or he just can't be asked doing it,0.095315985
because she just doesn't know what to do,0.15990292
and then one day emma stone comes in who's a relative of queen anne and rich or was his character,0.13675456
and then starts a bit of a battle of wits between her and rachel weisz to win over the favor of the queen,0.18508296
the favorite is a period piece filled with people who don't really like period pieces when I saw the trailer I knew that it was going to be a completely different kind of period piece film with a comedy in the execution,0.17287348
and that's exactly what the favor is I was very surprised by this film sense of humor,0.10756592
and the way the film was put together,0.061581142
it's very off,0.077938415
kilter very wacky kind of strange and weird sometimes that's definitely what I liked,0.33042946
the most about the fair but the sense of humor that comedy the way it was executed,0.24079174
it has made it a really accessible film to watch and much more easy to watch than a lot of period pieces nowadays but the film is also really well directed,0.041751716
I love the way the camera moves in this film a girl have a scene with two people,0.3568332
in a room,0.07345809
somebody walks through the door their cameras on them in a quickly swift to the other person like that,0.12737511
and then Swift back I just love how your ghost Lantern focuses the camera needs character I kind of like the law angle shots and the characters,0.14770292
I don't know why,0.1303941
but I just like the different kind of camera work,0.06723707
and that's what I mean when I say that this is a period piece film for people who don't like period piece ones because your ghost lanthum ox doesn't execute it like a conventional period Peaceville and the acting was really damn good as well Olivia Colman rich or Weiss Aniston all very good all Oscar waiver they play off each other very well my biggest issue with this film was I didn't find it to be all that compelling of a thought I didn't get invested really in the characters of the story,0.3222572
I do like the battle of wits that goes on between rich or wise and Emma Stone that was kind of fun to watch but as far as just a really compelling emotional story that I cared about it didn't really do it for me in that from pause the film felt a lot longer than it was for me,0.050784137
he's only two hours long,0.15226735
it felt like two and a half maybe even two hours and 40 minutes there were some parts that really dragged out for me especially the second quarter the film the first quarter,0.057956807
watch how it set up the comedy and the sense of humor the film then the second quarter took a big dip for me and it wasn't really as into the film as it was for the first bit the second two words were better than the second quarter,0.072705746
but I really can't call the favorite a bad fall,0.09392718
it wasn't a bad film whatsoever like,0.15437204
I said it was extremely well acted,0.15093042
it was extremely well directed,0.072818145
I love the sense of humor in the film I loved the execution the film very off-kilter I'd dug all that stuff,0.24143058
but the piercing and the whack of compelling story characters cannot bugged it down for me unfortunately overall I'm gonna go three out of five for the favorite,0.17533047
the only of the your ghosts London must film I've seen is a lobster,0.1677992
and I definitely like the lobster over this film,0.07739201
I don't know if that's unpopular or anything,0.1529796
