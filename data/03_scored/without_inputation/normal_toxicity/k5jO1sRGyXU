black clans mint directed by Spike Lee is a biographical drama film that takes place in 1970s Colorado Springs where a man by the name of Ron Stallworth is desperate to prove himself within,0.0019191427
the Colorado Springs Police Department Ron eventually becomes a detective where he works undercover with Adam drivers character flip to infiltrate the local chapter of the white supremacist group known as a Ku Klux Klan Ron calls the white supremacist and pretends to be a white supremacist himself and named Ron Stallworth and Flip actually attends events under that name as the two tried to infiltrate the KKK and tear them down things get very dangerous for both of them r17 to see black Klansmen for a while now it's been getting a lot of rave reviews and a lot of buzz and I'm actually a big fan personally of Adam drivers so he's probably,0.2509809
mostly what drew me to go see this one in theaters,0.10527153
I've never actually seen another Spike Lee movie but I do know a lot of people really loved his work,0.07039773
so that probably played into a little bit for me as well I like black Klansmen a lot of ultimately,0.23188964
I don't think it's quite Best Picture good,0.07061372
but it's certainly one of the best films that come out this year thus far,0.084173165
I don't think this one will make my top ten list at the end of the year because Oscar season hasn't really kicked in yet we haven't hit a lot of the great films yet but I think this is a very good film with a lot going for it,0.08605355
I think black clansmen is a very good very well rounded film that certainly succeeds in a handful of different areas at a high level firstly,0.07695392
I think the story is very well put together it's pace,0.043723278
well the characters are interesting,0.0281693
and the story feels genuine to its source material the memoirs of the real Ron stallworth himself,0.07668098
this story feels like an honest telling of events that led to some even more odd and unlikely defeats of evil the film dedicates a lot of time showing you how dangerous and just purely awful these white supremacists are how they're motivated by hatred for anyone of a different race anyone that's different than them,0.6364068
but the same time they're decently well organized and skeptical of anyone who may prove damaging to their cause,0.15186024
the story gets odd because the way the detectives actually infiltrate the KKK chapter is kind of remarkably bad so bad that the villains never truly considered it as a possibility,0.171816
because it just made no logical sense,0.11170163
that's where a lot of the humor comes in something else that black Klansmen does fairly well I'm not gonna say this is a hilarious film or anything like that,0.3373983
but there certainly are scenes that are pretty funny and sort of lighten the mood every now and then what's interesting though is that a lot of this humor feels very Tarantino like a lot of the movie does actually a way less violent Tarantino,0.10978778
though it's just comfortable poking fun at taboo subject matter like racism,0.43238494
and it does so in a way that feels sort of awkwardly light-hearted,0.06185732
it's to start contrast with the more serious tones that resonate more deeply and more often but it actually does provide a nice change of pace overall John David Washington and Adam driver both to a nice job of being funny but also being dramatic as well the versatility carries the movie quite a bit because they're asked to show off different skill sets at different times and it all works super well John David Washington and Adam driver actually do a lot of the heavy lifting here John David Washington handles the lead duties for the first act and then as the film progresses sort of becomes like a co-lead situation where he and Adam drivers share the responsibilities and share the spotlight they both have tons of great moments,0.050844412
and while I don't think either these performances are ultimately going to be Academy nominated performances,0.062862925
the both still really good some of the best I've seen this year thus far I've only ever seen John David Washington,0.041532874
in the HBO show ballers where he plays a supporting character,0.07433618
but I have a feeling he's gonna start laying some bigger roles after his great work in this movie Adam driver is just continuing to impress me more and more with each passing film,0.0925297
in fact I think he's getting better with each passing film this time around,0.08390611
he plays a character with a subtlety and nuance that works very well in conjunction with John David Washington's performance it's a little more in-your-face but still awesome speaking of subtlety and nuance I think this is one area where black Klansmen could probably improve I felt locked in for a lot of the film really engaged to the setting and the oddball nature of the story and the hopeful downfall of this local KKK chapter they're showing us where the film took me out of the experience though is when it comes across as if it's trying too hard to say something meaningful about issues we face in today's climate,0.2258454
and then there probably was a way to do this a little more subtly a little more naturally but sadly that's just not Spike Lee's style at points in this film,0.07008565
there's moments where I felt sucked out of the immersive aspects because I just felt the directors political end goals too clearly present in the source material it feels less like a movie at that point and more like a political lecture which is something that I'm personally not really looking for out of a movie going experience,0.11165743
if you can weave it in nacho to the story and then more power to you that's great,0.058688086
but if you're forceful about it it just kind of kills the immersion when it happens something else Spike Lee does here that bothered me a bit was the seemingly intentional means of editing the choppy there's that time the lack of continuity between cuts especially when two or three characters are just talking to one another,0.14875124
and there's a method where text is used in a way that feels out of sync with the rest of the film the editing is perfectly fine oftentimes but it's sometimes just awkward,0.09013799
and that's another place where the emergence uppers a bit because of that it seems like an artistic decision because it's done in deliberate moments to add a sort of awkward charm to the 70's style film but it just feels off the editing choices aren't always the greatest with this one,0.060939312
that said there are a lot of things,0.058211908
I really liked about black clansmen and I do think it has a very powerful message,0.108977474
the message to me was that racism is real and that it evolves and changes over time to take new forms as society changes and evolves itself I also took away that racism and hatred can lead to isolation on both sides this kind of division only creates more division and more animosity between people that shouldn't ever feel any of those things towards each other simply because of the color of their skin,0.29081708
this was an extremely tumultuous time for african-americans especially and in response many of them felt the need to defend themselves,0.15366751
it's a natural reaction,0.10140407
and it makes sense if you feel threatened but I think the film tries to sort of point out how both sides just retreat further and further into their own sides and just hate each other with the gap that widens even further day by day,0.15126766
there's just a lot to digest here and it's mostly insightful and effective overall though I found black Klansmen to be a very good film certainly one of the better ones,0.21746622
I've seen this year,0.053071454
I don't think it's quite gonna make it to the Oscar discussion,0.06265049
but you never know it has a powerful enough message that it just might as for the pros cons for the pros,0.09251148
I thought black Klansmen delivered a well-rounded and unique historical story lots of insightful commentary on important topics two great leading performances and some nice humor that balances the entire experience as for the cons I found the film lacks subtlety in certain key spots and it's editing choices weren't the greatest I'm still gonna give black plans but a nine out of ten because I think the pros outweigh the cons here if you're interested in a historical drama film with the quality message,0.11355883
this is a good choice,0.050899148
so did you guys see black Klansmen yet what did you think of it,0.47723895
and if not let me know why not I'd almost let me know the movie you're most looking forward to that's coming out in 2018,0.11192606
I'll drop mine in the comments below because I honestly got a thing long and hard about that one either way,0.19178738
this is wolf box,0.09666811
if occations iding off see you in the next review,0.46115923
