guys spend a long time coming Center hearts broken we've had our dreams crushed but I am so happy to tell you that finally holy about time DC,0.20285714
oh you know I was going to wear this for my review but um it's just uh yeah we're gonna just put put this back,0.110073164
here,0.053441156
yeah that'll do you can't even see it anyways,0.14275469
I word I have,0.039249465
never I I'm struggling to form a sentence that conveys how happy and excited,0.11563739
I am right,0.068891816
now okay,0.054177452
it's like twelve o'clock at night,0.1377647
I've been up to six o'clock in the morning I have to wake up at 6 o'clock tomorrow and I still have so much energy the adrenaline this movie has given me,0.06926793
so Wonder Woman newest installment of the DC franchise until now a franchise that I thought was just slowly crashing actually very quickly crashing and burning right before my eyes and to be honest I've given up all hope I saw trailers for Wonder Woman,0.24910262
I thought that looks pretty good kinda,0.091384694
but I don't really have that high hopes,0.08169444
because every DC movie has just been terrible,0.32261208
and everything Zack Snyder touches sucks,0.88824683
I know he didn't write or direct this one but he did produce it,0.07505512
so I was just like is go away,0.26765388
but I just I couldn't accept,0.064205036
I couldn't get excited about this,0.10567642
I wouldn't let myself do it,0.06775966
because I would not let another DC movie let me down just like the rest of them,0.15196149
but I am completely,0.034997907
completely,0.038264234
blown away,0.25033116
what is happening where do I even begin Gail gadot is okay,0.15961349
so like when they first cast her for Batman V Superman,0.14541353
and everything,0.05732748
I was like,0.039237767
I don't really like this chick she's really scrawny she's kind stick ish,0.7222239
she doesn't have like the size you know the size the Wonder Woman thighs shouldn't really have any muscle really she's just like this,0.2838289
Victoria Secret model looking girl,0.108592145
don't get me wrong,0.11416276
she is absolutely stunning beautiful,0.13928287
but I just didn't see that like Wonder Woman thing going on,0.101179756
oh my god she is Wonder Woman,0.14570634
I'm convinced this woman is Wonder Woman,0.24166453
she is an Amazon gal gadot Princess of the Amazons daughter of Hippolyta born and raised in say mascara,0.3979494
that's it,0.05140533
that's Bessel,0.068212174
that's it,0.05140533
nobody can tell me,0.11643766
otherwise this chick is the most fierce badass incredible woman I've ever seen in my life,0.68243206
I think I'm in love she had so much gusto and just balls brass balls but what I love about her performance and just her character and the writing in general in this movie is that she's so innocent and pure and just all she wants to do is help and save lives and she has so much good in her and she's also just so cute because like she's coming from say mascara and she doesn't really know what the world is like,0.35000265
she's never met a man before,0.4032392
she's never seen anything outside of what she's grown up with with the Amazons,0.15550354
and so she's just walking around just like questioning everything and admiring,0.24225861
everything like a little girl and she's so adorable and naive she asks so many funny questions and words things really weird,0.44272602
please and Chris Pine is just like okay,0.06988988
yep,0.05336829
and she's just like really blunt and innocent and just looking around at the world loving every second of it and I'm just like oh I just wanted squishy a little face,0.43723065
then there's like war going on and she just ripped off her clothes and has her Wonder Woman gear on underneath and she's just like I'm not innocent,0.32228026
I'm a badass she's like jumping on rooftops and punches through walls slicing people in half and kicking them at the same time and I'm just like how are you doing all this at once,0.71677476
I can't even keep up with what's happening right now,0.08904278
and when that's happening,0.05712255
she doesn't look innocent or modest or anything at all she looks like she knows she's Wonder Woman she's like I'm the man and there are times throughout this movie where she'll be like marching into battle or like walking,0.16543797
in slow motion into battle as she does a lot but didn't like a really cool not overdone kind of voice and she has this like really subtle smirk on her face which I love because for most of the movie she's just like she's not trying to do it for herself,0.26742795
she's trying to do it for everyone else,0.100775376
but when she's actually doing it,0.091423385
she's like yeah I'm aware that I'm the coolest person in the entire goddamn world,0.7955957
I'm gonna kick some ass and I'm just like yeah you are huh and then she rips up the frickin lasso room I love the lasso of truth because they went straight-up comic-book cartoon with it it's freaking a glowing piece of rope and it looks so cool,0.8785311
I will say some of the graphics we're not that great some of them were but some of them were like I just forgot about them or something,0.15297012
I don't know,0.1431935
what happened,0.05228998
but there's some weird green-screen in this movie but honestly I'm not that mad about it,0.15255956
it's a superhero movie it's supposed to look kind of weird that honestly if that's my only complaint from this whole movie is that some of the graphics weren't 100% that's it,0.07393776
I can't believe I'm gushing about a DC movie I'm so happy,0.07856515
maybe,0.038781885
maybe maybe there's hope guys,0.087677844
maybe this isn't a flaming pile of garbage after all just just maybe,0.74524254
and I think what sets this movie apart from the other movies and the DC franchise so much is the fact that this movie has heart like so much heart not overbearing but just enough to make you care and to make you root for the characters and to make you love every single character,0.064152025
and I think that's something that the DC Universe has struggled with because they just have all these characters,0.07830778
and they're just throwing them all in at once trying to create character development and origin stories and all of that at once and they just can't do that,0.15060373
but in this movie they're just focusing on Wonder Woman and her like ensemble and that you can work with that you can convey a really really good story with really good characters with really good interaction Chris Pine I am in love,0.1018777
I mean I was I was in love with Chris Pine but I'm even more in love with him,0.10271383
now his character just had so much heart and it was a different kind of heart than what Wonder Woman has and together they sort of bounce their ideologies off of each other,0.10678731
and it makes each of them better for it and I'm in love with this man Steve you stole my heart you have a lot of feelings,0.40332773
and that's not one of the only reasons this movie is,0.09999329
so great this movie is a true origin story from beginning to end,0.08613721
you see Wonder Woman as a child as an adolescent as a woman and even after that she's continually growing throughout the entire movie and it's believable,0.20735821
it's not rushed,0.080083534
it's not too slow,0.12094177
it's like the whole movie she's learning about herself and about the world around her and about the people around her and about what she can do,0.10075831
and she's constantly training and challenging herself until the very end when she is just the coolest so cool I'm in love with Wonder Woman I'm in love did I mention the Wonder Woman is my favorite superhero of all time,0.108143404
and if she isn't your favorite superhero of all time go see this movie and I guarantee you will change your mind,0.1666689
I will say there was okay,0.08849555
so at one point during the movie I had this stop where I was like ah this is kind of a bad quality that this movie has but then I thought about it,0.11924718
and I realized I was wrong and it's actually amazing but basically I was thinking that the villain of this movie isn't really that exciting,0.107420504
and I'm not really going to tell you who it is because it's kind of like three villains sort of and none of them are really that like whoa,0.30176598
but the thing about this movie is that the villain isn't really a character,0.10930278
the villain is an idea,0.16815999
it's a concept Wonder Woman is fighting the concept of war and violence and she's also fighting herself as well as the world around her and the people around her but essentially she's fighting the idea of war and she's trying to combat it with love which sounds really corny and cheesy and stupid but the movie puts it in a much much better words than what I'm saying right now and it's beautiful,0.60487384
I ok,0.051374305
I'm not like a cry person like when I watch movies I don't usually cry I could probably name for you like three movies off the top of my head that I've actually cried during and I'll say I like teared up a little bit,0.34814563
I didn't cry correct,0.072757185
but there were a significant amounts of liquid in my eyeballs during like at least four different scenes during this movie like it's who it'll get you especially all of the like subtleties about war and just soldiers in general there's so many just really small tender moments and very subtle moments where just like this is an accurate representation of war and how it affects people and how it traumatizes people,0.1178829
and it is real and it's amazing,0.0585786
how well this movie portrays that without like shoving it in your face and making you like terrified even though it is terrifying,0.46765232
but I don't know come on oh this movie just shows that beautifully,0.14840443
you just got to see it,0.10511143
another thing,0.058267165
I was worried about was the slow-motion anything Zack Snyder touches in any DC movie that I've seen so far for some reason,0.109702654
they just want to put slow-motion in everything,0.13174962
and I was worried they were going to do that in this movie and they do,0.058168225
but there's a but it's not really until the end of the movie that you realize,0.06910627
the reason that they're doing,0.05571578
this is to show you,0.10186443
what things look like from Diana's perspective because she's like super fast like she's so fat she's like the freaking flash so when there's action sequences where she's doing all kinds of cool badass,0.66029906
they put it in slow motion to show like her perspective,0.14979069
there's like bullets flying past her and she's just like slowly watching it,0.445323
and just like this she's doing all these like spin split kick ninja things and they'll like slow it down so it's all a that's my slow-motion interpretation,0.40309092
and it is really cool,0.04375697
I don't I didn't really feel like it was that overdone,0.093915686
I felt like it was a tasteful amount of full motion,0.10048194
and by the time you get to the end of the movie you kind of realize why that's like I say often but honestly this movie is so good it makes me,0.14934242
so hopeful for the future of DC and I'm so happy I don't understand how happy I am that,0.08465003
we finally have a good Wonder Woman movie oh my god I'm so happy,0.14199631
ah and it was directed by a woman just ban girl power patty Jenkins bah she's a real Wonder Woman,0.49352524
I got a second you patty Jenkins you rock you'll go Glen Coco oh one more thing one last thing less about the movie more about the franchise and justice league in particular okay,0.07588804
so you know how like Marvel movies at the very beginning,0.18633132
they have the like Marvel logo where it's like like characters and scenes and comics and they are like coming together,0.09116341
and it's like Marvel you know and talked about,0.15248993
so the beginning of Wonder Woman there's a similar thing but for DC and it's every single character from the Justice League,0.08228947
it's Batman Superman Aquaman the flash even cyborg but after they show all the Justice League characters,0.06494793
it's only the characters that are in the movie they show every single one in a row followed by Green Lantern,0.054175504
why is Green Lantern in this,0.062868275
but every single character that is in the movie even cyborg plus Green Lantern could it be that he is in the movie,0.06566789
my head's exploding,0.40324816
I don't know about you,0.24261084
so I'm really high,0.05696105
this is the first time I left a DC movie and thought I want to go see that again in theatres possibly multiple times and I am definitely buying it on blu-ray,0.078807235
no doubt about it,0.07646636
I have the theme song the one-woman theme song stuck in my head you know like me a new knee knee knee,0.3151053
knee knee that kind of sounds like the Halloween theme when you sing it out loud oh one fun fact that I think is pretty cool,0.14791295
all of the Amazons are played by like professional trained athletes and just badass women which i think is really cool just had to just had to put that out there oh I love women well that's my review of Wonder Woman my very very excited,0.27941844
exasperated review from Wonder Woman did you see Wonder Woman let me know in the comments below what you thought about it,0.10581179
I would love to hear everything,0.0960076
you have to say I would love to discuss this with everyone I just want to gush about Wonder Woman forever I'm so excited I'm so excited,0.24021743
are you excited because I excited I'm gonna go to bed it's late and I just have exhausted myself with excitement,0.16097626
so I'm gonna do that,0.06282714
