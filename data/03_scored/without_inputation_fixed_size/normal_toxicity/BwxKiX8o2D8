know about it meaning nothing third this screenplay is an excellent example of show rather,0.06570239
than tell you the cinematography of this film was meant to feel like a series,0.10433526
of photographs capturing memories from her gross childhood take a screen grab from nearly anywhere,0.15404133
in the film and it could go right in your photo album this film had,0.053514313
a very simple style of cinematography and I think it fit very well with the,0.07506689
story the story was about real life and the cinematography felt like it the whole,0.062102694
film was shot on a tripod and dolly with one hand held shot and no,0.18516116
Steadicam which i think is pretty interesting for a film shot in the 21st century,0.15330753
when there's so much big cinematic movement also to note the focal lengths all seem,0.06632392
very normal there wasn't anything extremely wide or extremely telephoto this gave the film a,0.069818415
really human feel now think about what this movie might have looked like if Michael,0.15035377
Bay I'm not going to punish you oh why not it was a sister cheetah,0.46461177
and I drove all the way home before we noticed people were talking really to,0.10348743
be fair I wasn't just married to Jesus it's been 40 years well he's a,0.114113584
lucky guy so after looking in the film here's my take on the style of,0.08413884
Lady Bird hey how's it going what you're doing you're so annoying do you want,0.5055737
I just want to talk to you what do you want I just want to,0.06322285

I'm done have fun with your cereal oh wait it's mine I'd pay for that,0.38800612
so with this shot I basically want to see how well I could replicate the,0.098686956
dynamic range basically had a few options blows off number one I could have raised,0.13622634
the ambient light in the room to match that of the outdoors with my prosumer,0.081015825
lights and the high ceilings this wasn't really an option a second I could have,0.05868348
decreased the life in the window I could have done this with sheets of nd,0.18545456
now I didn't have an in hand but we've used this in the past on,0.060513128
other productions and it's been pretty effective my guess on how big did this one,0.10719895
set was by pushing some extra light into the ceiling and then adding flags in,0.053362817
the foreground to keep the light off the actors my impromptu solution was cutting the,0.13684605
light slightly but the shears and then allowing the window to be overexposed by a,0.1145323
stop or two afterwards I realized I could have taken the exposure down on all,0.15420868
three shots because the foreground and the original scene is actually pretty dark second I,0.11672875
wanted to duplicate how a lot of the dialogue scenes were shot in this film,0.12058055
first a wide 50/50 and then two over the shoulder shots third was the color,0.12683098
grade here's the shot before new color grading first I took her still from the,0.2477296
movie scene and then I dropped into my timeline in the color panel I went,0.11167421
down to the color wheels and matched tab I clicked on comparison view and that's,0.06307738
at the comparison to the frame from the video I wanted to match next I,0.056420445
clicked apply match and waited for it to analyze make any adjustments you want from,0.08021184
there finally I jumped over to the effects window and edit effect noise at 3%,0.09372719
strength to make the footage look like it could have been shot on film and,0.16758958
