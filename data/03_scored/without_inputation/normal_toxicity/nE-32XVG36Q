hina a Monken over my classic reviews but people like all-time favorite movies give it a V watch and then come with you it and this video I'm talking about Seven Samurai which is the really classic 1950s film that established and creates so many tropes that it is now pretty much a cornerstone of cinema,0.09267652
it's a firm which is input,0.05243509
so many it's affirmative you'll be made at least twice in America,0.11681364
it's a film which is a big deal,0.105749555
and it's a film which was really really matters for the history and fabric of cinema,0.06582115
it's a film whose story is very simple,0.084586546
it's just a village full of farmers who were going to be attacked by bandits in a few weeks,0.32998767
so the higher summer samurai to protect the village from the ban this pretty simple story and although the film was three and a half hours long it's all those mer films that he's never born,0.09289802
it doesn't feel like freeing our powers at all,0.080448896
it's a very very interesting film that it's just,0.06397056
so just watchable,0.048666716
you can dissect Amazon graphic artistic lenses who it's experimental does it really seven son right is a story best film it is not this deep earth house movie it's not this experimental movies not a thong style,0.13169748
it's a film of a simple story a story based film and I think of all the films that are just stories there isn't one better craft to December sunrise late in history,0.059474725
sever time I might be the best crafted movie of all time,0.09420963
I'm not saying that there wasn't films I prefer more but a more flawed I'm not even saying that there isn't better mid movies because there is but I think that better movies that exist of like art movies I think something is just a story,0.07579629
and I think even at me was it a better made don't tell their stories,0.070607945
well after the Sun right,0.10109435
Samsung might tell its story perfectly and everything aware it is fantastic,0.06500059
he made the editing cuts on action at perfect moments,0.11460023
the camerawork is dynamic,0.07582675
he's roaming it's moving,0.11260506
the action is sometimes slow sometimes fast naturalistic controlled,0.101966515
everything is so perfectly aligned,0.058556467
the story is so well developed that hope does God feel really good arcs,0.06835972
it's really really well put together the other questions I can levy on it are best,0.115803294
if we just knit picks and really really mine and it picks at that,0.04885585
so let's just move where for now let's look at one of the things that's so great about is just the characters the characters here are iconic like absolutely iconic,0.058629606
I think there's no question here that some of them have gone down in legend the leaves I'm like kambei is this a jade humble dignified samurai who has seen a lot of death he's take a fight in and throughout,0.24240597
the course of the movie he would sit more fight in and I think he kind of is the Sun even the glue the whole summer summer together,0.07183687
he's the character who we always respect and we respect the fact that he sees this lost,0.15287684
not was a good thing even if it's for a noble purpose but really this damn character in some way is kikuchiyo who is one of the first characters ever put to cinema,0.73344934
and he is one of the best actors want the best arc in cinema the couch,0.08595522
it's a fantastic character he starts off the movie being kind of a laughable fake samurai he's not excited by the others he's a triangle among the circles,0.36866868
he's not the some way that they respect he's someone who's just a fake his swords oversized his papers a wrong,0.35967276
he's a liar,0.75366443
and his lover born is ridiculous,0.7093121
and everyone makes a mockery of him who thought the film they learned to respect it by the end of the film he has reached the level of Bentley penis,0.8606264
I might accepted as of summer like they expected or something like he gets the same treatment,0.11558402
as a song like he is a samurai despite the fact that he starts off to be such a laughable fake and there's two moments that define him that ever,0.49046588
I mean with best moments in the film at one point kikuchiyo holds a crying child while a house behind him burns and I think he at that point,0.29180247
he realizes how far,0.062855475
he's come from what he started,0.15003629
and I said really keep one for him on the sudden who he is,0.089837514
and what how he's changed and I think they have a really great point for the future,0.054757122
it's a speech midway through the film well he bakes a samurai for their snobbery towards a farmers or for their I can give at the farmers and I think it's the best moment in a film thought of so many fantastic moments,0.23979808
it's not my her Cuchillo really reveals who he is like not just in the literal sense in a very much,0.27296317
he reveals how he feels he the facade has gone and he perfected something right for the society they leave it for the responsibility in the oppression that goes on the front of samurai just looking down all those lower than them,0.09928713
and for the idea that the son might have sought wonderful,0.08341023
and I think coochie is kind of revelation here that he doesn't find all of them,0.2532456
expecting this,0.063294634
I'm right,0.07637071
he's really kind of interesting because that's something he seems to want to be,0.085755534
and it's such a fantastic moment the bricks apart the fell,0.06038369
I think it's a moment,0.05925833
well look the violet world around them,0.14824358
we see the clarity,0.04516588
this is a phone with a bandit sort of bad guys,0.5154597
but there's a point to myth about how the bandits and the Sun might both leave the cycles of violence that oppressed the peasants it's not just the pundits who have long in this world and so kikuchiyo lay in that bear in such a brutal honest fashion the bricks the heart,0.19325304
the other characters is such a fantastic moment in a film that really has so many others,0.055704486
but isn't really count if I were to fill about groups individual don't do you mean much to this family to feel about a group dynamic,0.077543914
so for example the titular taro something I must be aren't really developed or define,0.13459456
but what is define is how everyone function doing a group,0.044966776
we know how the team works even if we don't know how individuals work,0.11693547
and I think what's really important is sometimes I feel about groups we're curious how I die max his film he has the groups of characters that move and they even moved he ever unify all split apart and separate and coach,0.15929367
always all of our movement,0.08648226
I mean they're film exploring natural movement main wind but he constantly muses clouds and he constantly uses groups,0.13522714
it's about group mentality,0.22105844
it's not about individuals in this film,0.1534782
so it's a film where we have peasant versus some my versus,0.14697357
bandits,0.43157637
everyone is a separate group never one is expected to for those world,0.077477776
you want to be a Bundy or a farmer or peasant over some way,0.31089434
or wife you know meant to be anything else,0.17351563
and so this is a film where everyone goes into predefined roles in the society as soon as we see this quite okay we see it wouldn't character who fixed time I will defile his daughter who's a farmer and sir he gave me her not kind of emphasizes an ugly truth to society when defined in a way it shows the follows a feudalism,0.20266296
that follows of classifies of privilege it shows how bad they can be,0.1944489
and so Seven Samurai really is a film about the group mentality,0.11351582
it's about how people work a collectivist that it's not about individuality and that's kind of something that makes it a bit different to films of just like a singular action hero,0.107866876
the other thing is that this is also a hair of those two very traditional hair and narrative,0.05854552
the the seven song right,0.063869335
don't necessarily strike whose heroes in heavenly,0.07004887
but what they have is a moral character,0.107465714
they're fighting to protect one village,0.06339975
it's a very small scale story,0.060872044
just seven song with a woman village,0.15166366
it's almost gotten difficult in a way I think because if I was a judge I caught your consciousness it has become a myth really the story that Seven Samurai you've saved a village for no reward and great cost because almost in Heroes is that they're more character says that even though there is no cost and their glory to this,0.06944234
they will fight to the death then they do fight to quite literally a bad end for a lot of them fill all of these variations on this idea the actions are always seen,0.18902683
and when it is seen,0.054941162
there's often a lot associated with it fighting isn't always novel and fighting does lead to death if item does lead to suffering and as much as the fighting here is justified because you've got to see if the peasants and the bandits there's certainly a task Forte what keys interesting,0.1938491
I fixed,0.030876528
I'm saying right,0.078323096
it's just a master view like obviously everyone on planet earth,0.15433273
who's seen this film thinks is a masterpiece all they should do at least because it's so obviously is it among films it is just perfectly put together,0.14167617
it's a story which is really what Paul is never once boring it's fantastically develop the characters are so likable and if they aren't like people they're interesting,0.12926483
the story is simple which we call a mythos become an active,0.10122895
everyone knows it,0.0707776
it's inspired counts of us,0.07969263
I mean America did the Magnificent Seven we make,0.10650425
it's absolutely groundbreaking,0.10767376
it's absolutely astonishing,0.18402712
it's a film which holds up time,0.09608657
and time again I watch it pretty much annually and every single time I love it it's a feminist just it's magnificent and I don't know what else it is to possibly say well Severus I'm like you don't want to love words like perfect around because in all honesty nothing is ever truly perfect,0.3165602
but summer sign right you suppose it gets about as close to perfection as you can get given what it is it does it pretty much perfectly,0.062402636
so yeah it my favorite a lot,0.07404086
I know you know I'm not saying it is,0.057428297
but there's very few that are objectively better put together,0.0846218
I think there's Seven Samurai and it's just fantastic,0.057463907
so yeah so something like obviously a classic,0.16128103
