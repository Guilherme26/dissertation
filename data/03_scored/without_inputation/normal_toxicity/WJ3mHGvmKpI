I'm gonna do something a little bit different,0.13251635
I am NOT,0.10777101
reviewing a book,0.060844447
I am reviewing a film but it's got a book in the title um,0.07124213
so the film I'm gonna be reviewing is a one called book smart um,0.13204548
I just went to see it,0.069798626
and I loved it,0.05867915
I thought it was fantastic,0.123407565
so I thought I would share my thoughts in my review with all of you and seniors you know booktube I saw the word book in the title and I figured it might be something that I would enjoy and turns out I did,0.17566073
so book smart um it is a film about,0.14660475
so you've got Molly and Amy and they're the two main characters and they are very studious,0.111095846
they're very serious young women and the film starts on the second last day of school,0.12125201
so technically it's the last day of high school,0.08168781
and the following day is gonna be graduation and everybody's gonna be going off to you know their respective lives colleges universities whatever they're gonna be doing after school and Molly and Amy have spent all of their school career,0.05578508
you know studying hard be very serious about it not being distracted by parties by anything that was going on that other people were getting up to because they wanted to get the best grades and they wanted to get into the best universities and kind of set themselves up for you know their adult life which is really cool and they're very happy with this,0.075115874
they're their best friends,0.040334594
they have a really kind of sweet friendship they kind of do everything together,0.09008338
and they've been very happy with this,0.059078902
and in fact I would say Molly um kind of Lords a little bit over other people and she she's off,0.19773549
you know I think it's Yale that she's off to and she kind of just she's very kind of proud as you should be for getting into a good university and you know she kind of looks down a little bit on some of her so-called like slacker or party kids in the school and this is all fine and dandy until on the last day uh they kind of make a shocking discovery,0.3552886
so they discover that in spite of the fact that some of their classmates,0.10006109
have had a great time they've partied they've done what they want they've also gotten good grades and gotten into good universities and this is just a shock and a revelation to them Molly and Amy particularly Molly and they decide that what they're gonna do is gonna have one night,0.07715891
and they are going to kind of make up this four years of where they've not gone to parties,0.07932014
they've not had this sort of kind of teen high school experience,0.14095423
they're gonna make it up in one night and they're gonna go into the coolest party and they're just gonna you know be teenagers for one night,0.07833428
now kind of as you can imagine hilarity ensues on this night,0.24075334
because nothing really goes to plan and it is a it is a very funny film I laughed out loud,0.09630076
and there were people in the in the theater with me just laughing out loud at lots of points some of them are hilarious it's they're very kind of it's very high and I love kind of teen I'm gonna put my hands up,0.16473994
I love kind of teen American high school films anyway but this one is very funny what I love about this one as well is that the main character Molly,0.07793638
she isn't your stick-thin model type,0.38546914
and then Amy,0.042342782
she is a lesbian,0.69542736
she's out she's proud she's been out for two years she's trying to find a girlfriend um and the block does not hinge on coming out either and then you've got you've got some great queer up in this book,0.21786964
so you've got Amy and then you've got Amy's kind of love interest then you've got two side characters they're gay guys they're fabulous,0.5154597
they're kind of theatre and they're interested of doing these theater performances very flamboyant dresses,0.14288595
so there's some really great queer rep as well the parents are hilarious Lisa Kudrow as Amy's mother is hysterical,0.55079603
it's like a really small cameo but it's very funny,0.12071161
and I just kind of I loved the film I just thought it was fun,0.06606716
it was sweeted at heart to it it just it was it kind of talks about friendship and first love and there's just so many wonderful wonderful elements of it,0.09395908
and I highly recommend it,0.06173157
the other thing I love about this film is that you've got two female leads which is fantastic,0.24023287
and most of the storyline focuses on female characters as well as well as the director so I'm trying to make a conscious effort to not only watch films that have queer representation but also films that have female directors because unbelievably um,0.0132294465
it's not good Hollywood you still have to actually look for films,0.17635351
and this is this is slightly more of an indie film and Olivia Wilde is the director she doesn't awesome job,0.15460037
I think she's really created a gorgeous kind of I think like a cult classic teen film that I love and it honestly is,0.13130566
and the reason why I'm actually sitting down and talking about it is because it's it's my favorite film that I've possibly seen all year on in a very long time really really really enjoyed it,0.069302656
loved this film,0.09888688
and I would say so as if you like this you might like that if you like book-smart watch it please if you do and you like it you might enjoy it slightly older film crumbled 83 and I probably do a separate video batch of cat3 because it's one of my all-time favorite films but you know look it up online,0.18671843
it's kind of got that same vibe,0.13383749
that friendship that finding your way there's a queer element and that as well so yeah I definitely think if you enjoyed book smart you'll enjoy gypsy 83 so kind of those are my thoughts so what I'm gonna do with my film reviews is I'm gonna give you three of my favorite things about the film and then I'm just gonna tell you what the film makes me feel so my three favorite films about the favorite things about this film is that it was directed by a woman you've got an out-and-proud lesbian main character and the story's not about coming out or her being a lesbian she just is and then you've got a very strong female lead cast and a beautiful friendship and very positive female friendships kind of Pro women um which is awesome to see,0.30485442
and then for me this film kind of looks like a it's kind of a Mardi Gras meets clueless and this beautiful cinematography the colors are lovely,0.24109192
and then the outfits and some of the clothes are just really cool and quirky and fun then it kind of it tastes like uh I would say it kind of tastes like an ice cream sundae,0.10452502
but one that you've put all the toppings on just fun and ever Vicent and gorgeous and it feels like summer like sunshine and just like proper high school nostalgia for that time in your life,0.15342367
so I loved it I would give this to the easiest five out of five stars for films I've seen this year,0.07432384
please go check it out book-smart directed by Olivia Wilde awesome film loved it um thanks for listening to me today if you do want to have more film reviews or even music reviews as well please let me know please let me know if you've seen book-smart and what you thought of it,0.17999065
