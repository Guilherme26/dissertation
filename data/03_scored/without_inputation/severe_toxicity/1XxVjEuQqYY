a year before my mother was born but um when I got into it I,0.09430774
really enjoyed it like it was a little slow at times and you know the,0.048734013
it's a very old fashioned in some places even just from the clothes like the,0.046315406
guy wears the Fred MacMurray is the shirin salesman a Barbara Stanwyck is the wife,0.081156395
that convinces him to kill her husband and you know he his his uh waste,0.80154526
the of his pants are up to his nipples just about and you know he,0.5147215
talks to you and I hold that old film talked you know baby yeah I,0.06080244
want to do this like it's definitely the product of its time but it's interesting,0.03152638
because the actual tone of the film is incredibly dark I mean the story is,0.039869778
about a guy murdering someone and then trying to cover it up it's incredibly dark,0.39982364
at the same time like it's not dark like a movie today would be because,0.069012135
it like even though things are happening or really I mean he's kind of evil,0.10406798
the main character but like you as you're meant to like him and it's only,0.035742313

speak and this at the same time he's doing horrible things and I it's an,0.08620448
interesting the economy in the film and while I don't think a movie like this,0.016271057
could be made today with such a dark tone at the same time there is,0.06500973
no really graphic violence shown on screen I mean there are murderers and people are,0.24486105
shot and stuff goes down but they don't really show it like this kind of,0.1609525
happens like off-screen or like you see late yeah you know that don't show it,0.028739925
all the same time similarly they don't have any sex like the guys murdering people,0.62639296
for this girl you don't even have sex with her like because as you know,0.6281474
I think you know they had limitations back then with what they could show but,0.020435106
the same time they the tone could be really dark and it's interesting the same,0.016303651
time like the sexiest part is when the UH the Fred MacMurray kind of gets,0.04104782
entranced by her ankles oh there's some sexy ankles you wanna murder your husband I'm,0.7565163
down just don't cover up them ankles one thing I didn't like though is that,0.041129634
because you know has that whole that film noir trope I guess I may not,0.05109475
be the trope of the time of the person narrating the movie and the you,0.07522761
know at the beginning basically he's telling the he's recorded making a recording of everything,0.029830161
they did so he kind of know from we bright from beginning that he did,0.025163896
murder the girl's husband and like I would have that there's a moment in the,0.68139887
movie where he acts like you kidding I'm not gonna do that kid she starts,0.14915945
to hint at something when she's when he's trying to sell her insurance and she's,0.024241952
trying to hint at maybe buying some accident insurance for him and what that may,0.07598459
entail and you know he responds like a person should respond but then he goes,0.054533087
back and like I almost like if I knew he had to go back like,0.03988175
it was like the more if I didn't know that I think you know and,0.022487864
I kind of enjoyed the narration you know it worked well with the film and,0.017642
fit in nicely as in general I don't like when essentially movie Constable's itself so,0.030854544
overall I really enjoyed the Double Indemnity like I would recommend that if you're looking,0.044723623
for a classic film noir to look to watch and that's something that's really different,0.02880112
from movies we see in nowadays and I it's really interesting if I give it,0.029911313
