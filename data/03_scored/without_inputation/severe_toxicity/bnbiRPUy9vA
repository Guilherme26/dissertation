like to say he's just a big cry-baby well he is and that's kind of,0.26775625
what I like about him because a lot of times we get these villains that,0.124314174
are you know you can maybe relate to something bad that happened in their past,0.008448497
that made them this horrible human today but with kylo Ren he literally feels so,0.25988078
relatable like I feel like we've all had that moment in our lives whether we,0.090302005
were kids or teenagers or adults we're you know we we were just so angsty,0.074162655
and stubborn and mad at the world like we've all been there so I really,0.04870275

there was this weird connection or chemistry that they had I loved that they didn't,0.021417582
go all like romance with it because it so I really liked their scenes together,0.058249466
and how they were basically talking about the exact same things just coming from two,0.01711584
different sides one being a dark side and one being a light side even though,0.02876121
they both have both qualities in them like it just was really interesting for them,0.06042395
to be talking to each other and kind of relating with each other and in,0.03128425
later on kylo actually saving Ray's life which was incredible like usually I'm really good,0.05010163
at predicting these moments but when I saw that lightsaber moving I'm like ooh Ray's,0.035805505
gonna like unleash some crazy sort she's gonna go like Wonder Woman everywhere but no,0.2543565
that was awesome I was not expecting that moment with kylo Ren saving her so,0.03970348
that was that was something that was really really cool that I thoroughly enjoyed and,0.025503142
then watching them fight together oh my gosh their fight sequence together was probably my,0.10150902
favorite part of the whole movie I'm not gonna lie just the the production value,0.06686293
of that moment with like all the men in red and just the atmosphere of,0.074137375
where they were and the actual choreography of the fight sequences like it just was,0.038420342
outstanding I loved that I can't wait to go watch it again because that moment,0.050102964
for me I was just sitting there like eyes wide mouth open I'm just like,0.08787209
oh my gosh I thoroughly liked Ray's journey throughout this movie especially with Luke Skywalker,0.0700771
and how they just they were able to make these really really funny moments within,0.034236338
such a serious world and a serious thing happening I felt like the story felt,0.037666023
very contained which was awesome it was literally like just saved the rebels from being,0.077901654
extinct and that was just your a2b but there was so much that happened in,0.14876899
the middle of these tiny little plot points like C and D and E plot,0.23605342
points between a and B that I just thought were so smart and I absolutely,0.031245671
loved it and it just made the movie feels so action-packed and entertaining and there,0.020858828
was just constantly something going on which I loved I really liked that Luke Skywalker,0.029833486
was kind of like this hard-ass at the beginning like he really was um he,0.62063473
still is I mean let's let's face it he's like grumpy old man Luke Skywalker,0.35998285
but I really liked that because you had this like young and courageous full of,0.05233399
hope ray versus like the old man like it just was fun and I liked,0.24534126
their dynamic a lot I don't know about you but those pores are like so,0.051534437
cute they were funny and adorable and sad and I want them all and they,0.1021017
I just absolutely loved them I love the addition of new creatures into the Star,0.034944758
Wars world I really enjoyed Poe's storyline throughout this movie I they just they just,0.02254773
did such a good job giving every single character a full arc and a full,0.019837108
purpose like we've been seeing so many movies this year that have huge ensemble cast,0.035403736
and we're just getting like tiny little bits here there of like even even a,0.10212365
huge character just being like butt of all the jokes but in Star Wars they,0.12705673
had an ensemble cast of characters who had full stories to complete in this movie,0.021833323
which I loved and for Poe it was basically him being kind of like a,0.03148913
little bit of a hothead and I just I'm gonna run in there and I'm,0.4930121
gonna blow things up into actually becoming a little bit more strategic of a leader,0.24851544
that he definitely could be and so watching his journey especially going against Authority and,0.03835981
then kind of learning that maybe he should do a little more listening even though,0.022591632
you know his hearts in the right place I just I loved his storyline we,0.033928357
had a new character Rose played by Kelly Marie Tran holy moley oh my gosh,0.11728052
you guys I don't know about you but I absolutely loved her absolutely loved her,0.057185173
I thought she was such an incredible addition to the story and made for such,0.024290511
an awesome duo with Finn I can't even believe that a movie that was you,0.10094827
know two hours and some on change could have so many things happen for different,0.02678096
characters in just one movie the action sequences were so incredible especially the final action,0.01946793
sequence with the salt and how it was like red contrasted with white I absolutely,0.038825437
thought that was genius because it gave us a practical reason to have like a,0.021669023
red sky you know we've seen some other movies where it's just all CGI and,0.04102121
the skies are just so red or orange and you're like well why and at,0.026961224
least in this movie we had a reason it was the salt and every time,0.0292448
they moved the salt red would come up from it and it just created this,0.06821258
incredible element to the film and it was beautiful to watch and definitely add its,0.012448247
dynamic and depth to everything I don't know about you guys but when I saw,0.03713055
Oda pop in I lost it I think the whole crowd was cheering we were,0.06399466
just not expecting Yoda to be in this movie at all but I really like,0.017125819
I liked Luke's journey and how Yoda fit into that and it and it kind,0.036279783
of just came full circle I'm not sure if he's gonna come back or not,0.051721353
I kind of hope he does because he was obviously very helpful and I don't,0.04319969
feel that his relationship with kylo has been a hundred percent resolved yet so I'm,0.022819791
kind of hoping Luke comes back for that oh my gosh Carrie Fisher watching her,0.056978967
was just heartbreaking she just looked absolutely stunning just stunning and she just her character,0.05457832
got to do some incredible things in this movie and she played such an important,0.04807615
role it's just heartbreaking to watch knowing that she's no longer with us but to,0.0345809
watch her shine in this movie was just it I don't know it made me,0.096098416
sad but in a happy way if that makes sense she just was so incredible,0.01999276
in this movie and I it just it was beautiful and holy moly Lane's got,0.042441376
the force oh my god another moment where I was freaking out and screaming I,0.10621719
was just like what what what but after all these years how wait can we,0.01914332
go back like can we just like get a little like flash back or something,0.056184735
like how how did this happen for the first time is this a new thing,0.023812244
has she had it this whole time and none of us have realized this this,0.033848535
might be really deep of a question and it probably might be in a book,0.0204983
somewhere but um yeah was that a shocker for you guys it was this something,0.05973881
that you expected is it something you didn't like cuz I was all about it,0.041705683
