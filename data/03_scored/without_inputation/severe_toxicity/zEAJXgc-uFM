hi welcome to Reza views today i'm gonna be reviewing thor ragnarok this is the,0.05287345
third thor film and the 17th installment in the MCU so by now you should,0.026615327
know they're not you're into these movies there's been a lot of hype surrounding this,0.04075314
film especially because its promotional materials seem to show that they're taking a completely different,0.022156602
direction and a new tone when it comes to the Thor movies which was a,0.013481942
welcome change for me because I felt that the previous Thor movie stuck themselves a,0.017211627
little bit too seriously this was directed by Taika Waititi who's not a very well,0.15878399
known director he's directed a small film called what we do in the shadow which,0.02959003
is a hilarious mockumentary that I definitely recommend and I'm a big fan of so,0.053698946
I'm very happy to see such a small-time director get his big shot and do,0.2753803
a big Marvel film and I was looking forward to seeing what he's gonna do,0.096967146
with it and I think seen the film my first impression of it is that,0.01512162
it was fun with a capital S I generally liked Thor Ragnarok a lot and,0.071963556
I definitely enjoyed it but it has its ups and down so I'm gonna dive,0.12980062
in now and start talking about the ups the top three things that I liked,0.025030196
about thor ragnarok number three the visual style I really liked how this film looked,0.04101323
and felt this movie is extremely colorful and it felt like it had this 80s,0.034149863
cam to it which was really enjoyable editing in the soundtrack together make up for,0.042763993
this amazing visual extravaganza that you completely enjoy especially when it comes to the fighting,0.06578799
season this movie has awesome fighting cease really cool stuff the costume design is also,0.050554622
very cool so it gets his helmet finally we get to see that and it,0.038296618
looks pretty badass and the number one outfit in the whole thing for me was,0.10572761
Hellas costume it's so cool I cannot wait turn that into a cosplay the look,0.13704114
and feel of this film takes a huge departure from the first and second Thor,0.027401576
movies it looks more like guardians of the galaxy than anything else in them see,0.038206153
you and it really helps make you feel like you are somewhere out of this,0.07421454
earth because come on our real world it's kind of boring when you compare it,0.12570441
to the extravaganza of the cosmos the number two thing I liked about Thor Ragnarok,0.029623954
was Valkyrie introducing a new character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is not easy because,0.03295453
there's so many of them so it's very hard for a new character to make,0.027565876
an impact however Valkyrie played brilliantly by Tessa Thompson is an exception to the rule,0.028233055
she's funny she's cool she's but uh she's a great fighter she had really nice,0.07284226
chemistry with Thor and everybody else and with the Hulk I really liked her and,0.020005397
I can't wait to see more the number one thing I liked but Thor Ragnarok,0.034851633
was expanding the MCU similarly to guardians of the galaxy and also Doctor Strange this,0.019161945
movie expands the world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a very nice way where,0.08653308
it takes it outside of the human world and the human first world's problems and,0.30603325
ties us into what's coming which is infinity war turned out sweet in the previous,0.08950113
floor films especially the second one Thor seem to always be compelled to come back,0.037320793
to earth and interact with humans for some reason it's like we can't enjoy the,0.08248942
floor unless he was with other human characters but this time he's completely free from,0.04085425
those shackles and he's out there in the universe interacting with crazy things and crazy,0.12173792
characters and things that are as over-the-top and ask powerful as he is and also,0.014499008
this movie expanded the universe in terms of the mythos and it felt like it,0.036353618
was very Nordic in nature we really felt like the mystical world of the Vikings,0.08618119
and their gods and their mythology really come through in this film more than any,0.03773254
of the other films I didn't enjoy everything about Thor Ragnarok so here are the,0.03170598
top three things I didn't like about the movie number three not all the characters,0.027352352
work through I really like Thor holic and as I mentioned Valkyrie and a lot,0.059058994
of other characters that were in this film but there are two characters that didn't,0.009213459
work for me at all and one of them is Jeff Goldblum as Grand Master,0.0390669
an apologist Oh Jeff Goldblum fans out there but I haven't really enjoyed most of,0.03767334
his recent performances because they all really feel like they are the same thing and,0.018248647
in this movie it was no exception I always felt like whenever the Grand Master,0.022804491
was on screen that oh look I'm watching Jeff go boom it's a movie it,0.051042866
really took me out of the film and disconnected me from it completely which I,0.03438401
never liked another character that didn't work for me is Keith Urban's skirt who I,0.043495692
felt was kind of pointless I didn't really buy into his story I didn't really,0.040607467
care about him and I felt like he was kind of a waste of time,0.21987379
and now let's see even the performance wasn't that great he felt like he was,0.04308328
just there to be there I really liked Ella as a character and as a,0.025378752
villain in this movie however I felt like her character was a little bit mishandled,0.15265499
in the sense that her scenes seem to clash so much with general tone of,0.076685034
the film and also we didn't spend enough time with her she was mostly there,0.020949293
to be a mock piece for certain exposition and explaining her backstory to us when,0.13286777
I thought that her backstory was so compelling I wish I actually saw it so,0.06606205
as a character and as a concept was pretty cool and as a performance catcher,0.0320399
did an amazing job and she looked good in this movie I mean geez look,0.054058146
at that woman she looks incredible however towards the end of the film I felt,0.17877409
her role was not as expansive as I wanted it to be and I felt,0.16236867
like it was cut a little too short and I didn't also feel like she,0.06750084
meshed well with the rest of the film speaking of the tone the second thing,0.037146516
I didn't like about thor ragnarok was the extreme tone change like I said earlier,0.04083629
I am a fan of the change of the tone from the other Thor films,0.02294684
but this film felt like it went a little bit too far change and experimenting,0.060720623
is a good thing and I like seeing a fresh take on a character or,0.016872384
on a franchise however this film completely disconnected from the first and a second Thor,0.014367302
so I feel like there is such a thing as too much fun or too,0.02546057
funny I didn't recognize Thor's character in this movie he's so different from all of,0.019522475
the other films sometimes in a good way but sometimes it's felt like I went,0.03313812
a little too far and the same applies to Hulk as well which leads me,0.0302612
to the number one thing I didn't like about thor ragnarok which is the fact,0.026604686
that the stakes were not high due to the overtly comical fun times thing that,0.028401347
the movie was doing I never felt like any of the characters were in any,0.03351661
real danger and no stakes are never a good thing for a movie especially if,0.042777296
it's action-packed because those action scenes lose their intensity if you don't think anybody's gonna,0.047398992
get really hurt and the reason why I thought that's because everything was a joke,0.041683067
even intense emotional scenes were overshadowed by jokes and people not taking things seriously I,0.08623108
mean if the characters don't take the situation seriously I'm not gonna take the situation,0.028586932
seriously and I feel like this is gonna bother the comic book readers more than,0.025926197
most people but when you say Ragnarok Ragnarok is the end of days it's a,0.03633499
disaster of epic proportions and that kind of Armageddon feel never really translated well it's,0.07615754
like oh my god the most horrible thing is about to happen oh my god,0.13354027
this also girls would be a little bit emotionally disconnected from the movie and from,0.14246105
the characters and also didn't leave me with anything to contemplate or think about in,0.0235781
terms of themes in terms of character moments and character arcs it's just felt a,0.005093311
little too shallow which means I don't think this movie is going to leave a,0.033968933
lasting impression but only time will tell if I'm right or wrong oh I had,0.025163896
a good time watching this movie it's definitely my favorite Thor movie but it's not,0.01770985
my favorite MCU movie but if you've liked the MCU films so far and you'll,0.040560905
definitely enjoy this one as well it's a solid fun Marvel movie and I'm gonna,0.1453985
give Thor Ragnarok and eight out of ten so have you seen Thor did you,0.07054206
