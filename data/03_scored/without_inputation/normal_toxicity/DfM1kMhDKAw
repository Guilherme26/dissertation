hearing a lot about Dunkirk around the office and most of my colleagues keep focusing,0.09628701
on the structure of the story the limited dialogue and the large ensemble of characters,0.042262513
so normally I do like to walk into a movie with a completely open mind,0.119726196
or at least as open as humanly possible but in this case one of the,0.057548407
big questions I wanted to answer for myself at least was is this the best,0.06663503
way to tell this story now I think I'm leaning towards a no on that,0.072214864
right now but that doesn't mean I didn't like it in fact I really do,0.04068301
admire Christopher Nolan's approach and I think it served the movie well in some respects,0.070995614
but before I get too deep into my review a very brief synopsis for you,0.15420924
the movie is based on the real Dunkirk evacuation during world war ii and it's,0.12220617
divided into three parts so the mole is about a young soldier trying to get,0.12759487
off the beach the sea follows a civilian boat going to rescue stranded soldiers and,0.06210478
then third one is the air which features tom hardy as a fighter pilot first,0.027193034
off the obvious here on the technical front Dunkirk is fantastic the visuals are stunning,0.1473973
what it took to block all those extras is truly mind-blowing the sound design is,0.15986225
incredible and the way Hans Zimmer score is woven in is also something else there,0.045924637
are moments when it pairs perfectly with the gunfire or jet engines and then all,0.057295576
of a sudden it'll be in stark contrast to all that and there are a,0.04563534
number of moments when both approaches drastically enhanced certain beats of the story performances are,0.04773724
also spot-on throughout you believe every single person every single second beyond Whitehead does a,0.089516744
lot with very little dialogue as the main soldier featured in that first part the,0.0551113
mole and Harry Styles proves he's actually a totally capable actually a really talented actor,0.31812343
in that portion too Hardy is excellent in the air and so is Jack Loudoun,0.07707191
who plays another pilot in that part and then with a seat three leaves really,0.056160346
bring a lot to their characters you've got Mark Rylance our strong sense of common,0.0966481
determination to him berry Kyojin is George a really young kid just trying to lend,0.100592926
a hand and then tonglen Carney as Rylands his son who fits in right in,0.14425538
the middle of the two of them and he really brings the group together especially,0.073699154
when they start to navigate the situation with Killian burpies character really breaking it all,0.37519407
down now maybe I should give the movie even more credit than I was planning,0.075675815
to because every single segment is pretty moving and memorable and the ways they come,0.043375075
together aren't really in a haha see what I did there kind of way the,0.07797907
fact that they all connect actually feels organic and the way they come together also,0.035124503
winds up enhancing the atmosphere no one visuals very clearly show you how dangerous the,0.11701282
situation is then you got the score and sound design which make it even more,0.042650715
intense but that nonlinear narrative format actually further highlights the chaos Dunkirk is missing the,0.09212251
emotional beat of a traditional war film but in exchange for overwhelming atmosphere there's a,0.08702121
real chaos to the movie that makes the evacuation truly truly frightening this isn't a,0.09671396
scenario where the hero can save the day and then sail off into the sunset,0.12759769
someone's survival is just a total crapshoot you could see it in one of the,0.49148273
very first scenes when the beach is being bombed we're focused on one soldier on,0.08903845
the ground and we see the bombs dropping all around him so it's one two,0.27148187
three and then it stops right before he gets to him and it's so intense,0.12957352
I'm giving Dunkirk four out of five duties on the Dewey Decimal scale you may,0.15822046
not catch every single name or understand every single line of dialogue but Dunkirk will,0.05592831
make sure that you remember how treacherous this incident was while also highlighting the difference,0.18050344
just a little selflessness can make and that combination is pretty damn powerful so that's,0.34123686
