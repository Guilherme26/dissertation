unique traits and just nuances to that but she plays them as the same character,0.05966897
as well so that you can truly be a doppelganger and you see that they,0.039195947

her voice as the doppelganger is just downright creepy and weird I mean you have,0.29689768
to strain to listen to it a little bit because it's kind of like this,0.050400298

he's not I mean he is strong he is smart and I just love though,0.033442106

the doppelganger I mean he's got this mask on and he's he's almost like animal-like,0.15077452
and it just the whole the whole imagery and their mannerisms and their movements are,0.04241344
just oh not right Elizabeth moss and Tim Heidecker are also in this but honestly,0.04211743
they're barely in it I mean they are such small minor roles they're fine at,0.15314457
what they do but they're pretty insignificant really Pele has really created an atmosphere of,0.12637424
creep in us I mean he is patient with his shots without belaboring anything I,0.23522784
mean he knows when to sit on something and when to pull off and when,0.053663027
to move it and some of the tracking and just the slowness and the patience,0.027668979
to do certain things and then some quick movements when it's called for that also,0.017502977
so just the the differences in all of his shot choices and even the way,0.06390153
that he frames different thing in different areas of the film just really draw you,0.009998376
in and they just they like hyper focus you and then you had this soundtrack,0.05689449
in this score really it's more of the score that is off-putting and it messes,0.03172128
with your mind and it sets up this tone of just creepiness and not full,0.0749489
on terror but you know that something is coming and you don't know what it,0.08087902
is but you're pretty sure you're not gonna like it the story in us is,0.056672983
really layered and complex I mean yes on its surface it is a horror psychological,0.08116305
thriller movie and it is digestible and it is accessible by everybody but I know,0.061437692
that Peale did not just make a straight-on horror film just like in get out,0.05594793
I mean he had a horror and a psychological thriller in that but he was,0.10107399
also making a point in us he's also making a point and I'm I'm gonna,0.051927563
get into that right now in this video but it's definitely see it multiple times,0.0730651
I mean I'm going to see it in just a couple days again because I,0.04845264
want to catch things that I missed the film opens in 1986 in Santa Cruz,0.04484535
and the thing it kept running through my mind is well really two things first,0.018446872
off Santa Cruz in the mid 80s was not a place to be and then,0.075354666
I kept expecting to see Kiefer Sutherland and Corey Haim on the boardwalk someplace and,0.049989883
if you don't understand what I'm talking about and you don't get that then just,0.047572605
go look it up and then it'll make a little bit of sense it's not,0.0459755
very funny but don't at least make sense I had a blast with us I,0.080905624
mean Jordan Peele has solidified his horror director writes in my mind this is a,0.106338255
spectacular film and you know once is a fluke doing it twice that shows some,0.048235793
real talent and skill if you like psychological horrors or thrillers then you're definitely gonna,0.15381174
want to check this out there is no sex or nudity but there is a,0.28623575
