mediocrity has never been so good star wars episode 8 the last Jedi is directed by Rian Johnson starring Daisy Ridley John boyega and Mark Hamill having taken her first steps into the Jedi world Rey joins Luke Skywalker on an adventure with Leia Finn and Poe that unlocks mysteries of the force and secrets of the past if you were to describe this movie as a Starbucks coffee it would be like a soy a mocha frappuccino with like sugar-free syrup,0.17808571
and that's how this film feels where it's designed to keep everyone happy where it have ticks all the boxes it's funny it's sad,0.068881795
the more female x-wing pilots,0.24251969
there's more Asian characters it has dark parts,0.14888874
it has light parts,0.08364921
and there's a wings and I get it as a content creator myself,0.13635121
I can relate to what Disney is doing,0.045154404
but there has to be a line drawn at some point where it is impossible to keep everyone happy and I know them how I do with my channel,0.06961801
you know someone is going to dislike something,0.19225824
I do or it just won't agree with them,0.0675168
but Disney don't have an objective that this film just feels like a statistical analysis where it just feels synthetic,0.08492769
there's no heart in it it just literally just feels like a tick list and everything that was missing from the force awakens has cut being slightly crammed into this film,0.08319355
and to me it's kind of it's quite obvious,0.07677764
while my main prompts of the song is it feels very bloated for one it has far too many characters you pretty much have the original cast from the force awakens sweet girl I Bray Luke kylo hots Leia Snoke Poe Finn Chewie mouths phasma c-3po r2d2 a bb-8 and that's excluding all of the new characters on top of that,0.22661784
and if you compare that to saya a movie like a like the imposter a smack that has pretty much a cast of ten maybe plus a few extras like Boba Fett,0.31684065
so when you compare that with double the mass action double Man,0.101723425
the jokes that doesn't leave much room for kind of character development,0.11584169
for example Finn story arc is almost completely unnecessary,0.09012517
I mean you could probably remove it from the film,0.11338295
and it wouldn't overall make any impact anything you could just have his character in state to sleep for the whole movie,0.074295
and it really wouldn't have made much of a difference almost the same goes,0.054451693
for Luke's Marquez character,0.06832579
I just found he was just heavily underutilized,0.11001146
they have had Morphin or just done more with him,0.19357313
and I just found it was a wasted opportunity they could just cram so much more Luke Skywalker in that film but they chose not to probably cuz they're afraid of bringing back too much of the old cast but I honestly I don't from there,0.12808792
I've been a massive problem,0.15532635
how many Star Wars fans,0.07658604
would you say would ever complain about having too much,0.07093099
Luke Skywalker in a movie the last Jedi also tries to be funny,0.10580521
it's not quite as effective as a film to say like thor ragnarok cool and you ever got disney like properties where you know has lots of cute animals,0.1526024
and it has cuff the force awakens,0.07616783
when has they've heard these little quirky funny parts but I just felt just don't feel it was quite strong as the force awakens,0.126321
in that department that means comedies subjective,0.071191944
so some people probably disagree with me on that,0.0885136
but I honestly don't think it was quite as funny it was a quite fuse,0.10179031
the jokes were a little bit hit-and-miss,0.21967217
well it feels like it's dialogue it's clean a little bit made more for children like sums the lines to try,0.12565741
remember snuff them out one character says snuff them out or let's go chrome-dome or of course,0.14698273
they use like more familiar ones like you've read like rebel scum but I will never that scene it will never be as good as the scene in like Return of the Jedi,0.68231696
you rebels this movie almost feels like clickbait where it builds up quite a few great moments,0.21084644
and this is really really big build up from quite a few scenes but then they go and waste it,0.15139827
we've all the characters development and everything this film is so much potential to being great like the second act,0.07629736
there's some interesting character development between rain burn and also kylo Ren,0.058305666
I won't go more detail than that,0.11736355
but it is it was going somewhere is really cool,0.045980025
and they don't really use it very effectively,0.08679242
and there's quite a few lackluster moments where you think there's a what were you thinking it would have just been,0.31435102
so cool,0.03968372
if they had gone a different direction but they didn't officer that's a personal preference and obviously being a fan of the franchise,0.05506817
everyone cut wants things can't go a particular way and how they imagined it,0.087361395
so when it doesn't then obviously it feels more disappointing,0.15101871
I understand that,0.06700695
but for this I honestly think they could have done a lot better,0.05609309
I'd assume the resources Disney have they could have done better,0.059098743
I obviously think it's a little underwhelming,0.36237818
I find the film's biggest weakness is probably its plot,0.08018295
I don't go into spoiler territory but it pretty much revolves around a starship fuel and stalling for time it's filled with deus ex machina ray is still a complete MarySue if you're not familiar with that term it pretty much means a character who does nothing wrong there's everything pretty much correct,0.08837825
every time,0.07809457
everyone likes them the pretty much near perfection so much to a stage where you can't actually relate to her and she's very similar to that as she wasn't the force awakens and they haven't kind of correct to that problem whether I recommend the last Jedi if you really like the force awakens then yes it looks great it's fun,0.11725163
it's funny I'm sure you're pretty much enjoy all of it but if you're like me and you found that the force awakens was her like lust a remake off a new hope then you'll probably think it's okay,0.32590786
maybe you'll hate it,0.31089434
but I can say that at least,0.06598848
it's not a carbon copy,0.059309002
you know it has its own original content,0.070741326
and it does take a few chances here,0.056255013
and there but as I said before it just feels a little bit bloated,0.17436142
I think too many characters there is some hope there is progress,0.04004003
hope,0.058086127
maybe the third film it will be completely,0.07523533
its own thing 100% and they won't need to steal scenes from other films,0.16012964
they don't need to you know they've got so much content,0.14925611
there's so much resources they can do anything,0.081451975
they want hopefully an old for a public movie or something like that that'd be brilliant see ya so they are getting something,0.18669039
but yeah for me I just think it's a good movie,0.10255498
well I want to see it again a time soon probably not maybe a year from now maybe,0.064672835
I'll watch it,0.06352146
but I had that same effect with the force awakens,0.05348839
so that's your benchmark really thanks for watching guys,0.07573821
and as always I appreciate the supports,0.03392308
