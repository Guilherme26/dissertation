Logan is directed by james mangold and is supposedly the last time we will ever,0.04384292
see Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine and Patrick Stewart playing Professor X in this movie which,0.09492769
is set quite far into the future we can see that all mutants are pretty,0.056313783
much extinct and Logan and Charles are pretty much hiding out in the middle of,0.047005203
nowhere trying to have very little to do with anything until this young girl called,0.16052145
Laura enters their lives who is on the run from an organization and she may,0.1216734
or may not be related to Logan in more ways than one believe it or,0.022541078
not this was my most anticipated movie of the year the trailers look very promising,0.02533751
it was nice to see James Mangold who directed the Wolverine which I actually quite,0.083870344
like coming back for this one and I also wanted to see how they were,0.032441672
going to handle Hugh Jackman's last outing as this character and I've gotta say they,0.028285604
did it in the best possible way they could have done because this movie is,0.02142091
amazing now due to the success of Deadpool this movie is rated fifteen or if,0.022700056
you live in America rated R and it shows I mean from the opening scene,0.077881694
alone you've got blood swearing and limbs flying everywhere and it's kind of satisfying as,0.21893322
the movie goes on you can tell that they are pushing this 15 rating as,0.026426416
much as they possibly can the swearing gets a lot more frequent the violence gets,0.09217184
a lot more gloria and brutal as the film goes on and there are a,0.09614165
couple of times near the start of the movie where you do feel as if,0.049243547
they're pushing it a little bit but by the time the movie kind of spreads,0.05354795
out and kind of evens out where the violence is in the movie it's kind,0.16809458
of a lot more easier to take in also all of this swearing and violence,0.28066838
doesn't just happen for the sake of swearing and violence it all feels very warranted,0.08497987
and actually feels worth it and this is easily backed up by James mangles superb,0.03983652
direction I mean this is easily the darkest comic book movie I can think of,0.03755427
since the dark night it's literally there's very little happiness in this movie there's a,0.11889227
couple of times that make you laugh but throughout the most of the movie it's,0.029578056
very dirty very grimy and just very depressing overall I mean not like I said,0.43869528
not the whole movie is depressing but it just has that very realistic and grounded,0.043795027
feel throughout the majority of the runtime the way they approach this movie by stripping,0.04324891
back a lot of the aspects most comic book movies nowadays have and making it,0.022133986
almost like a independent movie with it's very stylish yet gritty cinematography really shows and,0.029032605
actually makes the movie more personal than your average comic book movie the performances in,0.074379504
this movie are universally great but the two standouts are easily Hugh Jackman and Patrick,0.03614608
Stewart who give what could be argued as career best performances Hugh Jackman absolutely nails,0.046886135
it as Logan he's been playing this character for 17 years now but this is,0.01019527
easily the best he's ever been as this character he's broken he's aged you can,0.0330869
see that his healing factors not working the way it used to and all hope,0.017384574
that he did have is just gone he really does not trust anybody and doesn't,0.02435836
want to be around anybody because he knows that they will get hurt Patrick Stewart,0.097765364
on the other hand gives just as an emotional performance as Hugh Jackman does and,0.026874749
is kind of sad looking at Professor X now because the what they've done in,0.05778184
this movie is they've given his character a mental illness which plays around with the,0.16630855
telepathy and mind control powers that Professor X has and it makes his character really,0.026317991
vulnerable and kind of fragile and it's really sad to watch because you've seen these,0.03267249
two characters in their prime in previous movies and just seeing them in what looks,0.02316103
like a shell of what they used to be now it's kind of emotional and,0.05172601
also where Logan has just completely done with hope you can tell the child does,0.024061687
have a little bit of hope left even if it is a very desperate means,0.03989439
of the word hope but you can tell that he's trying to make Logan believe,0.01414114
again Daphne King as the little girl Laura I thought was very good even though,0.16851896
she barely says anything throughout the first two acts of the movie but she makes,0.07189238
up for it with some very convincing facial expressions and just by generally kicking ass,0.8416842
in all fairness I think she actually kills more people in this movie than Wolverine,0.41952556
does also Steven merchants in the movie and he's not as annoying as I thought,0.11317701
he was going to be he was actually a very good character I mean his,0.029673178
character could have been cut from the movie and it wouldn't have make difference but,0.018048428
I thought his performance was actually pretty good for what it was now unfortunately I,0.078586124
do have one very minor problem and that is regarding the villains now don't get,0.02019431
me wrong I actually quite liked the villains in this movie I thought they were,0.04938656
very interesting the motivations made sense for the sake of the movie and they were,0.02135173
both acted very well especially the guy who plays Donald pierce the guy with the,0.0824249
robotic hands from the trailers I thought he was specifically very good but they do,0.039389513
fall under the same problem that most MCU villains have which is the fact that,0.034223035
they're kind of there for the sake of being a bad guy and they're not,0.09295742
that memorable apart from that I absolutely loved this movie and it was everything I,0.044136263
wanted to see in a final installment like this the violence was incredibly brutal at,0.1450679
times hard to watch but yet they also knew when to be heartfelt and emotional,0.045176614
and actually made me tear up more than once and that's surprising because I don't,0.024494058
usually cry these kind of things the last time I cried at anything was when,0.046361305
David Tennant left Doctor Who like that alone made me a crippling mess on the,0.06767445
floor Logan kind of did the same thing as well and because of this i,0.078881465
have to give it a 10 out of 10 it satisfied everything i wanted to,0.053883865
see in movie plus a little bit more so guys that was my review of,0.09811592
Logan if you send the movie then let me know what you thought about it,0.03860327
