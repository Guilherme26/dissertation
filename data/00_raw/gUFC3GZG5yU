hmm great ice cream tasty do you want to be a part of this fight a part of this history whatever you need me to do I'm available [Music] sailes finder my name's Jimmy cage and the arrival of a new film by Martin Scorsese has to be an absolute highlight in the lives of most lovers of cinema especially when's going to be a gangster film the genre he's probably most associated with lots of cinema laughs Scorsese and Scorsese loves cinema is easily one of the most outspoken supporters and preservers of the art form therefore it's even more perplexing to grasp the fact that his newest film has been realised as a Netflix production and there are only very few limited theaters where you are able to watch it on the big screen if you by any means have the opportunity please take it for those who haven't and of course for all of those who want to see it for a second or third time it will be released on Netflix on Wednesday the irishman stars Robert a Nero Al Pacino and Joe Pesci and what can he say this year gave us the epic conclusion of Marvel's infinity War saga and it will also give us the photo time being last chapter in the Star Wars saga but Martin Scorsese's teaming up again with the Nero 24 years after casino bringing back Joe Pesci from his unofficial retirement and also a uniting the two legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for only the fourth time ever on screen all this definitely makes the Irishman one of the biggest events in film dis year it's also the first time ever that Scorsese worked with Al Pacino and also the Joe Pesci M Pacino I in a movie together and if you haven't guessed it by now it surely delivers on all the high price had already received it's pretty damn fantastic it has the story of a mob hitman the tequila Irishman Frank Sheeran played by Robert De Niro who is recalling the events of his life and in particular his connection to the union leader Jimmy Hoffa played by Al Pacino the characters and the events of the Irishman are all pretty much based on real people and their stories and involvement in American history to what degree the film sticks to the truth can be debated and is getting debated the screenplay was written by Steven Zaillian who has won an Oscar for screenplay for Schindler's List and it is based on a 2004 book I heard you paint houses but a former homicide prosecutor investigator and defense attorney Charles brand which chronicles the life of Frank Dee Irishman Sheeran there has been disputes and counter articles to the book which I don't really want to go into that much here I think for the movie it's only important that you know that it tells a story that might have happened this way or in a similar fashion but of course it's also told through the lens of a poignant horror movie it's an epic crime film and in the vein of most of Scorsese's films it's a drama that's also highly entertaining and really funny at times with the running time of three and a half hours its consensus longest film and I was a little bit afraid that it might turn out kind of episodic because it is primarily distributed on Netflix and they might have unofficially divided it in smaller parts so it's easier to watch for an hour and continue the next day but in my very positive surprise the Irishman definitely feels like a complete picture and as someone who's a big fan of tight movies that don't waste a lot of screen time I was also surprised that I pretty much cherished every minute of it I think you could possibly cut it down a little bit and just left off some of the shown events but I also think that it all adds to the feeling of a long travel and recollection of a man's life that is unfolding in front of our eyes like I said I watched it on the big screen the house was packed and the is rather narrow I guess for the last hour so I kind of had to go to the bathroom but because I didn't want to disturb anyone and also because the movie was dead captivating I just didn't go and I really didn't mind that much because I was really glued to the screen Martin Scorsese with almost 80 years old is still a filmmaker full of energy full of passion full of wit and drive and he Irishman's 209 minutes a packed with amazing scenes and it's not just the best off of his previous gangster movies it's its own thing of course it revisits familiar but away it taketh its story and also the way this whole project is coming together on a meta level with the Niro Pacino and Pesci United and also portraying their characters at different ages over the course of a lifetime and three and a half hours of movie time is simply remarkable and in the hands of such a brilliant filmmaker this can set you in a stage of absolute bliss the film is moving on three different timelines which it is constantly and effortlessly jumping back and forth to in typical Scorsese fashion we get one of those super long continuous takes but this time not through a casino but through the hallways of a nursing home where the old aged Frank Sheeran is sitting in a wheelchair and recollects the events of his life to the audience we also have the younger but still very old Frank who is taking a road trip to Detroit with his friend Russel played by Joe Pesci they are on their way to a wedding and we know that there will be another very important event happening at their destination then we have the third and I would say main timeline which chronicles Frank's life in the Mafia this timeline sets in sometime in the 1950s and then progresses through the years until we end up at the road trip and then even later at him being in that nursing home there's another jump back in time to Frank's time in the war but that's just a very small scene now let's talk about a negative the Irishman is already very famous for its extensive use of digital DEA agent technology or Uthoff occasion we see all three main characters as well as many side characters at different stages of their lives but instead of casting other younger actors it's really the Niro Pacino and Pesci who are playing the parts with their faces digitally changed to look younger the first time we cut to the Nero's Frank as a young man in his late 30s or early 40s I guess is really off-putting I assume you've all seen the trailers for the Irishman and you probably noticed the effect as well unfortunately it doesn't look better in the finished film oftentimes it's not that easy not to think of the Nero's characters some kind of video game character I think what makes it worse as the fact that they gave him blue eyes because the real Frank had blue eyes of course it has always been a common practice to change someone's iCal on screen by wearing contacts or by digital effects but all the de-aging combined with those striking blue eyes of Frank it felt really weird and your brain just instantly knows that this isn't right and as a consequence I had a rather hard time for a very long time to fully investigate into the Niro's character because it wasn't easy to even accept him as a real person fortunately though the effect somehow works much better for Pacino and Pesci it's also noticeable in certain moments but somehow they seem to be much closer to reality and not in that uncanny valley De Niro's character ISM but I can also assure you that the film is strong enough and that you get used to it maybe because your brain just gives up at some point and accepts it so it's really not a deal-breaker at all in the end and it also gets better as the movie progresses because the depicted time period is allowing the Niro to get closer and closer to his real age which means that by the time you should be invested most into the story it's also the time he looks the most natural and even though the nura look sweet in many scenes the whole first hour so well as well as the rest of the film holds so many wonderful gangster scenes that reminded me so much about my love for the grand theft auto video game series the title of the book the movies based on is I hurt you paint houses and this can actually be considered the unofficial title of the irishman as well because the title the irishman only appears on screen at the very end but at the beginning it's I hurt you paint houses in big white letters on black only that Frank's painting houses with the blood of the people he is supposed to eliminate there are so many little and bigger gangster scenes and the way the film portrays it's different time periods is handled with such an eye for detail like I said it's a pure joy and this is a movie that stuffed with great characters and great actors from Harvey Keitel to Ray Romano everybody shines and what a gift it is that we got back Pesce to portray the gangster boss Russell Bufalino this is a true master performance unfolding on-screen and unlike other Pesci roads we have seen normally you would expect him to play someone explosive unpredictable and overtly violent and yes there is a glimpse of what Russell has done in the past but mostly it's him overseeing his men and I was really surprised what kind of warmth this character was losing Pesci brings so much gravitas to the film and it makes you understand how Frank was drawn to him and this lifestyle but the one who is killing it the most is Al Pacino he plays the union leader Jimmy Hoffa and it takes some time and here we are being introduced to him this marks the first time Scorsese work with Pacino and what an energy he is bringing to the table be prepared for that Pacino rage the screaming the cursing the intimidation but also for a fully fleshed out character who becomes the central point of conflict throughout the story in the hands of the right people you simply get this special kind of movie magic and to see the friendship between Frank and Jimmy form and where it goes is mesmerizing and the West Coast says he directs his actors and how the scenes are unfolding is so great these characters have so much personality and just to watch them talk with one another is amazing and the Irishman always succeeds on both fields creating this highly entertaining fun gangster film full of great dialogues about coming to lay two meetings what kind of clothes to wear and the beauty of saddle or not so subtle meanings behind specific words and then on the other side is since see a human drama and distance deconstruction of this gangster lifestyle this is what Scorsese can do so well and there are times where the Irishman can be the greatest romp and then there are times where it's really mature and revealing how empty these lives truly are for a long time I wasn't so sure who this Frank Sheeran actually is what are his goals his real ambitions what is he seeking in life the film takes us on a journey and we are always with him yet he stays kind of and big years maybe it needs to repeat watches but maybe this is also kind of the point we never really get to know him that closely I think a very important aspect of the film is his relationship to one of his four daughters from a very early age on his Peggy was always troubled by his obvious links to the underworld and what her father is capable of doing and their relationship gets only more difficult in time for some time I thought to myself that we really don't know anything about her character and that she's just another female character who seems to be very underwritten but I think again that that's exactly the point the whole film is told through Frank's perspective and not really to get to know that much about his daughter is only logical because it underlines that he was never really able to create a meaningful bond with her his way of life was always in the way and then for the film won't give us and won't give him the pleasure of really getting to know her I really think that the Irishman is a remarkable film and there's of course a lot more that I could talk about from the music to the camera and editing from the period settings to the emotional finale to the way the food portrays eating it's a super rich film that deserves your attention I will watch it a second time for sure when it's out on Netflix and again if it's playing in a cinema near you go check it out so in German I'd say Martin Scorsese's shivani design often gangster film is Taran Adarsh to Kino the de-aging technology is filleted anomie Hoonah puts and each oscar left about a studium gansan kind Apple Robert DeNiro Al Pacino on Joe Pesci in diesel form for iron Susan is an father who goes artists and I give the Irish
