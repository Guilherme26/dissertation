hey what's going on you got like what you got such ownership or big dog back with another one take review there we got a review for the farewell Sam I have been so ready to see finally I said see it today Ostara aquafina man listen this was one hip this was a lie one hell of us [ __ ] move okay and excuse me for curses over a love child trying to slow down and what pull out on the person but this hit me up it's a sense it's about a girl named Billy who and whose night-night a grandmother flavor I got am I saying it a grandmother night cuz I don't feel right and that's up I say at night but Aquafina plays a girl named Billy who her grandmother's dying they do not have or get into shoes in Zoo it sound of I got a shooting sounds yo so miss out but uh the film is about my grandma's awkwafina's grandmother's dying I'm training I can't be in their grandmother's dying and her family doesn't want to tell her not not aquafina like the family doesn't want to tear the grandmother that she's dying and Aquafina us like what is like the whole thing the whole film is about like everybody going to like be around this person and this person is to go on and on about that day like everything is normal because they haven't I haven't told them I mean she doesn't know what's going on they there's like a wedding involved and like that's - this used to get every wedding and this used to get everybody around just so they can be around their grandmother my mother you know with Lucian as diversity is a certain different people and the thing is aquafina was grew up in America she she was Chinese we should grew up in America and in America she was about six and in America you can't do that you know I'm saying somehow that something's going on or somebody's father you have to tell them the truth I'm like in China you can't if she's diving I don't tell her they not telling us not against the law is not a crime and so who becomes like a batter of like kind of like should I guess you could say kind of say traditions you know I'm saying a sense of logic cultural preferences and stuff because I'm offended going up too many like this is not right but the whole family isn't agreed as a gradable I know we're not telling and for me it kind of speaks in certain ways because my grandmother was the love of my life that's the person raised me just I was a kid I'm saying I've been with her I was her now sounds kind of weird with her and things they love my lifestyle weird but you know what I mean like she raised me my entire life that's one person I live until I know they moved up so I don't know that feeling of like if I ever had to like get a situation like this because what the film does really really good it shows you very quick how close they are you know they're you you feel like you don't you've seen them come up together and you know that I never got a relationship granted they give you that in like the first five maybe ten minutes of the families I guess bet that relationship is established it is believable I think it's absolutely still for me and my pick for this field that I've seen this yeah I've seen quite a few I haven't seen everything but for the fans I've seen this year she's giving the best performance I've seen oh yeah because she just has this she has to maintain a look of light calm this when she's around a grandmother but you could steer seed like the willing and I eyes and just the look of despair you can I can just you can see jewel hurt and and out of pain is but because I she's suffering this is somebody she's loving somebody she no ball can't go in a day and this person doesn't know you know I'm saying and you have to keep it from this person everybody else everybody else is a great tool but like the or faint oppose that offer something to die marvelously appeal I appreciate it no and out honestly awarded okay I know she's getting gone but she doesn't get an honor mr. [ __ ] and alright I must go in the next twenty some days I must gonna see some five other great performers that are just all the worldly birds right now she's kind of like my lien candidate for female actress for the Oscars I have to say in this film I just thought and I thought I feel like the film was beautiful work well we're crafted and acting all I was good it's just like aquafina definitely stole the show for me here's our grandmother it did warm Fraser grandmother wasn't getting you know she's ins out she's also does a great job because she's so jolly and and she knows she's sick and there's times when she's only trying to play it off like it's a magnetic field it's a film well you touched watch to him and it's not because I've heard great things I was like okay I'm going to think cuz I've heard great things about a lot of things doing it oh my god that was i but this one lived up to the expectations that that were placed upon of us only other people to have heard about this film it's just it's just a beautiful story and like the it isn't crazy nothing like oh my god everybody that happened but time to sort of steal that kind of weight you know it's like flowers either a little theater but I love my living room just feeling like I mean I thought there was like maybe about twist or something is just like a straight for you know almost this is just weird it's weird but I think what they did with this that the way they blended like the cultures and strong like the difference I pay another favor I did a good job at their it's like crazy rich Asians because they kind of like adjust those issues when is you but just like how the cultures are different you know doing things one way in America they do things another wind chime in in this film played into that it's like you had the conversation it's like so many different things it's well done man braided of course is guessing a managed I can't think of nothing I didn't like about this damn op that was one part that just feel and kind of drugs on to moms but it's not a big deal so yeah you get you see in the photo where you guys never know she thought about dying to come this hit that like button subscribe to your channel and I'd catch up with you guys later
