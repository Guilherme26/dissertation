hello,0.054463096
everybody I am Tiffany here with Bella and flareon once again to bring you another movie review I'm super excited for this,0.10070754
it is award season time guys the Oscars are coming up soon the SAG Awards the Golden Globes have already happened a bunch of nominated movies are out right,0.109711416
now that I really have wanted to see,0.046725683
so just warning,0.17621048
you you are going to get a lot of nominated movies these next couple of weeks,0.13852403
because well that's what I've been watching,0.07063636
so I can keep up,0.062264558
and all my nominated movies the movie I am reviewing today is one of those nominated movies and the movie I am talking about is Luther needy bird,0.07696071
it has an amazing cast it has Saoirse Ronan who was in Brooklyn and she's been around for a while like ever since she was a little kid,0.24639471
she was in Atonement did you know that she was briney in atonement,0.1706648
he's also Laurie Metcalf,0.10285408
in this movie Lucas hedges who was in three billboards as well and Manchester by the sea he is just killing it right now so good for you Lucas hedges it's also directed by credit Gerwig,0.63526136
I'm sorry if I pronounced any of those names wrong it overall just has an amazing cast and amazing team behind it and I believe chronically directed wrote it produced it she did everything basically so good for you Greta Gerwig you are amazing,0.09732631
I was super excited to see it everybody's been raving about this kind of calling it the new Mean Girls a little bit too with watching you now I can see that aspect to it,0.42654917
I over all really enjoyed it,0.09089272
it definitely isn't my favorite movie of the nominated movies but it's still super good and definitely deserves to be nominated,0.09977867
it's a really fast paced movie it's only an hour and 34 minutes people that is pretty short,0.14576498
so if you're not looking for a movie that is time consuming or the epic length of Titanic or Lord of the Rings then this is the movie for you because it's the complete opposite of that it definitely is a mixture of drama and comedy,0.1455354
it is on the lighter side in my opinion it has its very serious moments,0.099190205
but there weren't any moments in it for me that made me cry insanely or just burst out into tears and meet issues or anything like that overall,0.26062742
it's still really good,0.07381446
and it definitely does give you the feels it just doesn't bring you to Fault in,0.064469926
Our Stars level,0.07139201
you get me as you can see I'm wearing pink because well her hair is pink in here,0.18688573
and I think her cast is pink,0.1549083
so I figured pink would work pretty,0.09503609
well for this movie review for those of you who want statistics,0.24161255
this has an eight points zero on IMDB that is mind-blowing amazingness alright that means it deserves to be nominated and it does it deserves this rating it's super,0.23048885
duper duper duper super duper good for those of you who want a synopsis and have no idea,0.2818921
what Lady Bird is about it follows,0.09752458
this girl named Christine who nicknames herself Lady Bird as she travels through her senior year of high school and is about to go off to college,0.34608132
and it's a coming-of-age story has a little bit of Mean Girls esque feel at one point in time and overall it's about her growing up and becoming an adult and experiencing stuff in life that she has an experience before in her past,0.24238865
I definitely believe this movie appeals to the young adult crowd people that are 17 18 19 my age just because it is that coming-of-age story and it is going through that senior year of high school and just being 19 years old right now and watching this movie I definitely related a lot to it and empathize with her law on certain things just because she goes through some typical high school stuff,0.080645084
she goes through different changes,0.091066614
she deals with her family dynamic again,0.099767745
and it's that moment in time where you're about to move on to your life and become an adult and go off to college and live your life,0.29414704
I just really appreciated it especially at my age right now and I definitely want to watch it when it wait older and to see a different perspective that I get on it,0.064447
I definitely recommend this movie for people to watch I think it's really really great,0.13642216
and I think oh absolutely enjoy it,0.085554354
so sure Ronan did an amazing job,0.15211219
and if you watched the Golden Globes I believe she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress Laurie,0.047768656
Metcalf got nominated I think that'd be the only thing that I had an issue with this sometimes it seems with a little bit too fast,0.15228455
and there were moments in grey that I wish they had just kind of stopped,0.14389059
and let's sit there for a little bit for the audience,0.08423328
but other than that it's overall really really great movie,0.07173677
that's really all,0.05146871
I can tell you without spoiling you,0.45077083
so I suggest you go now non spoilery people go watch this movie and then come back,0.29611066
and we can talk about all the feels together,0.07066701
alright,0.048265677
good blue get,0.039552182
it bird lady bird overall like,0.18768252
I said I really did enjoy this movie Saoirse Ronan,0.28080618
I felt like did an absolutely great job,0.09352165
her character was just super fun interesting,0.08671713
seeing the dynamic of her going to a Catholic school and also growing up and being a senior and dealing with the very strict environment the relationship between her and her mom was absolutely interesting,0.0826969
and I think Laura madcap did an absolutely amazing job because while she was tough and strict on her daughter and it irritated me I felt ladybirds irritation you also felt the love from her and you do get in a way she's trying to push Lady Bird to be her best self but she doesn't always do it in the best way you don't have to be that hard on your daughter,0.23752095
she's doing the best she can and probably your attitude is what's causing her to rebell even more I do like that Lady Bird even acknowledges in it that her mom does love her and cares a lot,0.3799574
it was just a very interesting dynamic because you can see Lady Bert's irritation with her mom but then you also get that Lady Bird understands her mother's love,0.29509187
and I thought that was really cool that it wasn't just this contentious relationship I both understand each other and they have their really sweet moments,0.06421427
one of the best moments between them is when Lady Bird is very hurt by her boyfriend Kyle because kayo lied and said he was a virgin when he wasn't and I mom picks her up and Lady Bird gets in the car and she's crying her eyes out and you're feeling for her and her mom just hugs her and goes,0.40311164
do you want to go to our favorite thing,0.05357106
and Lady Bird says yes and then they just go to different houses and look at different designs that was just a really sweet moment,0.060415726
and it gives you insight into their relationship without you having to go through the whole backstory of her from being a kid to,0.1341551
now I love ladybirds dad,0.24203163
he was super kind super caring and you could see all the effort,0.035792727
he put in he was definitely a character who wasn't in it as much as I thought he was going to be but he still made a really good impact which I really really loved baby,0.118113264
birds dating life though I just felt bad for her she falls in love with Danny first and first of all Danny I'm gonna kill you it's just wrong to do to a girl I get it you're trying to hide it,0.65753114
and I felt bad because he in a school where that is really not allowed,0.30774048
so I understand hiding it,0.07286802
but the fact is that he didn't let ladybird know,0.09426582
and she believes that he was truly in love with her and he wasn't he was just using her and he felt bad for him,0.24275385
because you can see he's a genuinely good guy,0.084936894
I just was like why would you just not tell her,0.15514357
I mean I understand in one way but you don't need to lead her on like that you can say hey I don't really think we should date,0.15750207
that's what you can,0.062200174
do,0.03680355
you don't have to explain why,0.1492996
if you really don't want to I did feel really bad for him,0.1553112
and again there was the sweet moment where he does visit her and he's freaking out because she saw him kissing another guy,0.46487665
and he's saying,0.07836775
please don't tell and she just hugs him and goes,0.13874203
I'm not gonna tell and he breaks down in her arms so that was really sweet and that was one thing about Danny is he did mess up really bad but you can see he genuinely,0.2667199
I think cares about ladybird as a friend more so and he was just scared,0.31089434
he didn't handle it right,0.095966525
no he overall was just scared and was looking for a way to make sure it wasn't really ever found out Kyle,0.08446593
on the other hand I did not like as soon as he was saying to ladybird,0.26080632
oh yeah I haven't done it with anybody either,0.062140465
I just went liar you're a liar,0.7734328
it was very obvious,0.062049657
I'm sorry that there's no way he hadn't been with somebody like that before,0.10497331
oh it sucks it sucks because at that moment it's just taken away from you,0.92717445
because you think you're sharing this moment with someone and then he's saying,0.1493107
oh yeah I've done it before heaven,0.10261681
he's denying that he ever said that he hadn't done it before,0.12750451
and I just wanted to rewind the movie somehow and play it back for Kyle and say there you said it right there right there right there right there,0.043181557
I loved ladybirds best friend Julie she was super super sweet and kind and she reminds me a couple of my other friends too I just loved her she was probably my favorite character actually just because she was so genuinely kind and sweet and you could tell she meant,0.115233615
well I mean Lady Bird made her rubella a little bit,0.4197052
but overall,0.052775852
she was a goody girl of this whole entire movie I did have issue,0.35454115
in a part of the movie where it goes,0.056200135
mean girl just because I felt like that flip was insanely fast and that sometimes happens throughout the yes that seems didn't linger long enough for to have the super emotional impact that it did,0.23788564
and I just felt like that transition from Lady Bird abandoning Julie and going to Jannah was just SuperDuper quick because all you see is her have one conversation with Kyle then all of a sudden she's talking to Jenna and completely ignoring Julie,0.18002658
I felt like there should have maybe been one more scene or so I kind of connected it a little bit more because while you get the sense that Kyle is popular,0.1324076
they don't really connect him to Jenna,0.076458424
completely,0.038264234
I mean you understand that once she starts talking to Jenna but still it wasn't like,0.09775072
he said he was best friends with Jenna or anything before unless he maybe said it in the scene when they talked that they did I'm sorry,0.07870262
I don't remember that though I feel like they should have had one more scene where maybe she sees Kyle hanging out with Jenna or something and then lady 4 decides oh you know I'm gonna get it with Jenna,0.12319864
so I can go see Kyle I just see how quickly she turned away from Julie that was frustrating,0.10906279
but also again I felt like that happened too quickly,0.07237213
because again if you're going for that Mean Girls vibe you don't completely go against your friend like that automatically all of a sudden she's needs truly one time then they're not talking anymore and I'm thinking why why because Julie's amazing you need to go for Julie over Julie right right Donna Lauria and go for Julie you knew it wasn't gonna work out with Jenna Jenna was just annoying,0.30547905
she was the most annoying character,0.5610934
actually she ties with Kyle her and Kyle,0.10628359
we're just look look what you can tell you not a good friend where she finally realizes where Lady Bird lives,0.1941633
a good friend would have said I don't like that you lied to me but you don't need to be ashamed of where you live instead,0.2590474
Jenna just goes,0.043330614
I don't like this honesty we're totally never ends,0.16523671
I think I hit that right on the mark what do you guys,0.35502446
think after that her and Jenna just kind of fall off the map which I was quite happy about because I don't like Jenna and my other favorite moments is when she does go get Julie and brings her to prom it was funny because the ones we got to looking at them dancing thinking were you guys doing,0.14956172
but in the end it ended up being just this really sweet moment and going to prom with your best friend is the best thing ever,0.11230193
I'm just saying you don't need a date to go to prom you can go with your best friend overall though felt like it was a great movie,0.09426394
but again I did have a little bit of trouble with the quick editing just because it left,0.1073756
some of the characters a little bit underdeveloped,0.4146641
I felt like for example Miguel and his girlfriend Shelley Shelley seemed like a really interesting character and you have one moment with her and Lady Bird when they're smoking and she's talking about ladybirds mom and how she really admires her,0.24211833
and that's really the only time you completely get to know Shelley and Miguel you get to kind of know here and there but not fully and again his moment is really when he's about to go get the job that his dad actually interviewed for as well overall those were just two characters,0.10260241
I felt like since everything moved,0.07424845
so fast,0.066809915
you really didn't get to sit with them and understand them a little bit more,0.24255978
the only thing,0.09602896
I really actually didn't like sadly was the ending,0.057497498
there's a super fast paced movie yeah the tragic moment where the mom doesn't get out of the car to say goodbye to her daughter who's flying to New York what the heck and she runs out of the car and tries to say goodbye but misses her and she's breaking down in the father's arms and you feel for her but then I'm saying it's your fault because you didn't get out of the car the first time and you've been a jerk to her about this even though she got it even though you thought she wasn't gonna get in,0.71354294
so she proved you wrong in that you should just own up to it,0.29870915
and eventually just prohibit her but what it does is cut you her in New York,0.14965393
and basically what it shows us her goes to this party get drunk make out the dude throw up the dude brings her to the hospital and then she gets out of the hospital find her way back to church even though after going to the Catholic school,0.31313616
it seemed like she really wanted to stay away from religion,0.28840023
and then she calls her mom and leaves a message and says I love you,0.18327533
and it was a very sweet moment do not get me wrong,0.12207715
I loved that she said I love you to her mom,0.2520509
I think that is a great way to end it but it didn't feel complete after that I was waiting for more the movie to show her being successful in college or that her mom listened to the voice message you see her mom's reaction to it,0.24084224
I was waiting for something and then all of a sudden,0.0975181
she says I love you,0.073232315
and then the screen goes black and the credits start rolling and I was sitting there going that's it,0.058709398
so I don't really know how to feel about the ending,0.101461835
I feel like I wanted to happen was seeing her really thrive for being College and show that she's alright when her mom really didn't think she was going to be I guess then had this moment where she really does miss her and get through that call or just something,0.112406135
maybe if they had added a scene at the end where they showed the mom reacting to the voicemail and you know the mom got the voicemail maybe I would have felt more complete about it all,0.09059182
I'm not sure there's just something missing at the end for me,0.10072885
and maybe you disagree with me,0.1445774
and think it was the most perfect ending ever,0.20374078
and I feel like it could have been a perfect ending,0.19810703
I do like how she said I love you to her mom at the end,0.30221757
but there was just something else needed I felt like,0.057597183
and I'm not sure what it is and it's killing me,0.5154597
and I don't know what it is,0.10179126
and maybe everybody else thinks it's a perfect ending and I'm just crazy,0.31089434
what do you guys,0.07031446
think of the ending for those of you who have seen it do you agree with me,0.18275389
do you think it was a little bit short or do you think that it was a great ending overall that is really all,0.11567677
I have to say about this movie though I thought it was overall pretty good there were little problems here and there but I just absolutely enjoyed it,0.13162793
still overall,0.06725155
