hey what's up everybody today we're talking about the comedic drama called the favorite directed,0.025306912
by your ghost land the most the cast is headlined by Emma Stone Rachel Weis,0.06509022
and Olivia Colman I'm gonna let you know where this film thrived I'm gonna let,0.12284013
you know where it fell short and I'm gonna give you my opinion on if,0.04387618
I think it was a successful film so let's get into it historia said in,0.042611
eighteenth-century England it focuses on Queen and played by Colman she's in weak health she,0.04428327
has an unpredictable temper as well and in her place Lady Sarah played by Rachel,0.043734495
Weisz governs the country while also tending to the Queen's well-being and this is a,0.038632534
dynamic that's complicated when a new servant named Abigail played by Emma Stone enters the,0.027446808
picture and begins to meticulously insert herself into the relationship which naturally causes a lot,0.13987881
of issues the style of director your ghost lanta MOS is definitely an acquired taste,0.115770556
I don't think his films are aimed towards general audiences either but regardless of that,0.032569386
I think he routinely crafts some highly artistic films that always captivate me to the,0.20838208
point where I'm not often sure whether I liked or disliked what I had just,0.04691274
seen which is something very odd for a person like myself who virtually has an,0.02881775
opinion about everything in terms of his overall body of work I would say this,0.07646619
is easily as most consumable film it's his most straightforward project but I definitely think,0.065446086
it still had some of the hidden elements in the narrative that provoked a lot,0.017598763
of thought which I always do appreciate from him it also had some beautifully polished,0.063296214
visuals that I really love from his direction and his artistic eye I think he,0.06770505
did a great job of giving the camerawork a personality of its own in this,0.058329288
story that just complimented the tone perfectly most often he has the camera lower shooting,0.08789471
up at the characters to give them a stronger on-screen presence this framing of the,0.023878762
shots is also really able to capture all the ornate detail of the backdrops at,0.037238978
all times he also positions the camera to frame the walls on longer angles which,0.026164334
just provided a ton of depth throughout the film and it routinely pulled me into,0.020614041
the scenes in the rooms with the characters he also made interesting use of a,0.01928833
fisheye perspective to create kind of a stuffy feeling that fit the atmosphere of the,0.03385851
story very well he complements that with simple camera pivots to follow the characters and,0.027288495
it really helped me feel and connect with the mood of each scene which I,0.037908815
found subtle but highly engaging I thought the makeup and the wardrobe design were flawless,0.031798437
the cinematography from Robbie Ryan just complimented the direction perfectly about the lighting did a,0.028209774
great job of fitting the tone of each scene perfectly to just heighten the emotional,0.03264455
reaction I thought the score was this subtle but impending and it did the same,0.01876882
in terms of just bolstering the film when needed I very much enjoyed the progression,0.023514241
of the storyline it develops the relationships between all the focal characters with a nice,0.017666612
flow it touches just enough on the state of the country and the governing issues,0.067921236
that are going on behind the batch up of all these relationships nicely it gives,0.056659013
a lot of weight and meaning to certain scenes and for me I was able,0.05060983
to find the story to be more than compelling enough to hold my attention I,0.020239543
thought it had enough explanation to it but it also had many implied meanings and,0.018322483
I thought this balance of both is why this could easily be the most mass,0.017993882
consumable film from land the most who I think is a fantastic director from a,0.05041094
technical aspect but as good as the story was it's the lead trio of performances,0.03227205
that make this movie worth a watch wise stone and Coleman are all at the,0.037436534
top of their game in this movie the performances are filled with layers of emotion,0.032828145
and intensity and I was really able to invest in each of them for their,0.041798145
own reasons the chemistry between one another was fantastic as was their timing and the,0.01826062
result was a collection of character dynamics that hit with a lot of impact because,0.020536214
they felt genuine in their build up Rachel Wise was excellent she thrives in time,0.028604228
period pieces and she did in this one as well she was just unassuming one,0.10164605
minute and so matter-of-fact and blunt and callous the next she showed strength and vulnerability,0.054896276
with a nice balance and when it was called bond she hit some very emotionally,0.09646094
charged scenes with a very smooth capable delivery and as the story progresses and control,0.033201978
begins to be threatened by her character she's really forced into some emotional positions and,0.18108693
Weiss portrays it all with a fascinating literalness that I just found very appealing and,0.027720863
I thought Olivia Coleman was much the same as the story evolves we learned more,0.034522366
about her capability in the position of being the Queen as well as her mental,0.27331358
state her health and her mental strength are just slowly deteriorating and Coleman really captures,0.14767143
this range of distress impeccably I thought this vulnerability is what allows a manipulative person,0.09901258
into her bedroom and into her heart so to speak and I thought the way,0.25201976
Coleman captured this conflict was just impressively genuine and as you would expect emma stone,0.036569137
did not disappoint either she was easily the most interesting character there were so many,0.022994068
different sides to this role throughout the course of the story and I thought stone,0.019273032
really nailed all of them with perfection through her facial expressions her mannerisms and the,0.28713113
delivery of the dialogue I thought she perfectly captured her characters just methodical manipulation just,0.02635258
as the story needed it to she was charming and calculating at all times and,0.025339507
with stones performance I was just completely intrigued by what her next move would be,0.03118115
and I found the unpredictability to be very refreshing nicholas hoult comes in and provides,0.028035495
a great supporting performance as well and overall I think everybody did a great job,0.03188824
in their roles I thought the dialogue was just nicely written it was sharp witted,0.19993891
the humor was very clever I routinely was laughing and chuckling from the back and,0.049645316
forth between the characters some of the laughs because of the genuineness of the material,0.036185324
and the Frank delivery from the performers other laughs coming from just the timing of,0.021020468
the situation's of a given scene and like you would expect from the lanthum of,0.04755531
film some laughs just out of simple awkwardness from the sexual imagery this is where,0.28715378
I think general audiences could sort of disconnect from this movie a bit some of,0.037771787
the dialogue felt more worded for shock value than it did genuine lanthum oohs also,0.025579637
likes to slip implied masturbation and forced nudity into his films and that's his choice,0.60914415
the humor though is routinely timed with the effective satire some of the sexual implications,0.23603076
in this story are without question needed for it but some are simply not I,0.015331153
don't think a panning shot of a character walking past a row of women lined,0.19992094
up along the wall all with their breasts hanging out has much of an impact,0.5952242
on the story and no matter how artistic you try to make it the result,0.029784262
is gratuitous and not much different than this no I'm not judging much like when,0.022071458
I was younger some kid down the road is gonna be watching HBO one night,0.17626102
he's gonna see this movie and it's gonna be his first movie he ever sees,0.10030637
but these are scenes that are gonna rub a large portion of audiences the wrong,0.10814024
way who may not be familiar with lanthum OSes body of work but overall I,0.06054701
found it to be a very good film that had me engaged from start to,0.041125644
finish and the favorite from me is gonna get 85% on the entertainment meter both,0.033138786
the characters and the plotline continually evolves with an intriguing flow that kept onto my,0.02745612
interest it's a beautifully crafted film but some people may be turned off by the,0.030670952
forced sexual subject matter that doesn't seem to be moving the story forward and some,0.24658427
of the dialogue that those who tend to love traditional time period movies may be,0.025739945
very surprised by if they go into this movie without doing their research first thank,0.03190088
