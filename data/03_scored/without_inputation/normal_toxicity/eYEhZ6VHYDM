yeah sorry,0.062141728
I was asleep my power start off every video by basically lying to you guys like oh I was asleep,0.37215438
oh I didn't see you there,0.08261241
I'm such a piece of you know what you never quite know what you're gonna get from your guts what an absolute man lad with last year's the killing of a sacred deer,0.5931159
I was surprised by his ability to make such a dark and unsettling story with really complex characters and subject matter because I had seen the lobster before that but I have to be honest,0.07123645
I didn't really care for it all that much I still think it's due Murray watch at this point but I didn't really appreciate it quite as much as I appreciated that movie and I just didn't really click with me,0.060576297
but yeah I wasn't in love with it as much as everyone else was sacred deer,0.07111626
though that's that's probably my favorite even now honestly,0.05044518
but this movie is quite unexpected,0.099829406
I think what are these noises with the lobster and sacred deer,0.07829009
you could say that they break conventions quite a bit they're really wacky and strange and have a very weird story and very strange and off characters,0.31040674
you can say the same here,0.09679114
but the story is somewhat more accessible being a period drama of sorts,0.11709892
although Jurgis has no doubt flipped it on its head a little bit let's talk performances before we get into all that,0.30863798
though why the hell is no-one discussing Nicholas Hoult that dude had me howling with laughter in pretty much every scene that he was in oh my god that made his character absolutely ridiculous but so entertaining I really loved him and miss stone was pretty great here I'm not one of those people who goes really mad over her and I've never really seen the big deal about her but as much as everyone else seems to but I did like her here,0.5116883
I always just like her really which I guess is a bit of a shame because I'm not really seeing what everyone else seems to but I'm glad that I at least enjoyed the performance not many of the characters about likable,0.15868302
but she is especially not that likable here,0.28691182
she's a very selfish character,0.6364068
but she does have a lot of brilliant dialogue that makes it all worthwhile,0.10192292
Rachel,0.03408818
Weisz is terrific as usual,0.16281816
I always loved her and she sells this role great with her really dark and witty character manner which never really failed to make me feel on edge something about her character is just someone settling,0.074707255
because of the way that she treats the people around her but it's played so well that I can't really help but love it just listen to my cat for a second at the door not the best performance for me without a doubt is Olivia Colman,0.14403237
it's actually been amazing to see how she's got to this point just from being lovely Sophie on Peep Show to Tyrannosaur where she was unbelievably brilliant and honestly oscar-worthy as well even more so than this role,0.15447755
I would say and now to the point where she's actually a contender to win an Oscar I'm actually really proud of her for getting to this point really hoping that she wins it honestly her performance is spectacular,0.12967137
here,0.053441156
she encapsulate s' Queen and in such a strange and unique way,0.3057036
often she is sad as or extremely angry or sweet and kind or very loving and appreciative,0.15159963
I can't vouch for how historically accurate the treatment of these characters is or the treatment of her relationship with Rachel Weisz but it's still very entertaining to watch sometimes Olivia just made me want to cry,0.0991497
though she's so sad I've read up on the film a little bit,0.17667778
and there's some historical experts who say that it's not all entirely true some of it just kind of goes off rumors that circled around the place at that time somebody just kind of made up for entertainment value,0.05783986
and some is completely accurate whatever it is,0.035585582
you can trust your ghost to make it entertaining and to fit the script and the film itself,0.1095265
he really did a number on this movie taking this story and these people and turning them way upside down making something so utterly unique funny crushing dark and weird as hell,0.48587725
the script isn't written by him,0.123999074
but he's the perfect person to helm the film I think historical films can be a bore we've got plenty that tell it in a completely honest and accurate way and show it all in a really kind of boring and just lifeless way the post with this one we get hints of accuracy for the historical parts,0.17265502
but its story is exaggerated to the point of no return,0.06972017
I also love that the camerawork is so out of whack you never know when it's gonna be like high up or low down or a fisheye or not a fisheye it's really quite disorientating,0.27895358
I think I quite loved it for that the characters are what really make the film work in the long run,0.044031106
it's sort of a power play type story and it's great because you never really know what any given person's motives are,0.07981142
there's barely a moment alone with each character,0.07278649
so you don't really get to see what their end game is or what they're planning or anything which I think reentered a lot of mystery,0.11124516
there's some great comedic value as well the dialogue alone is incredibly witty and Alerus,0.0826899
and the dance scene had me laughing so much,0.1121303
and I love that the men in the film are just so absurd and almost have this kind of slapstick dialogue but at the heart of it there is definitely something more serious,0.4411465
you can get a big load of tragedy on top of all the ridiculousness because at the end of the day it's centered around a woman who is very sad has suicidal tendencies depression possibly an eating disorder 17 rabbits that reflect every child that she's failed to give birth to so we have a lot here to be upset about but a lot hid a laugh about as well the film is incredibly good the more I think about it the more I appreciate it,0.44430888
I'll admit that when it ended I was thinking what the hell I'm not quite getting all the hype here but I've had time to think,0.35190845
and yeah I think I definitely get it,0.07273896
now,0.03121897
so yeah see this movie it's absolutely brilliant in my opinion,0.13981032
so I'm gonna give you the favorite and 9 out of 10,0.18188488
