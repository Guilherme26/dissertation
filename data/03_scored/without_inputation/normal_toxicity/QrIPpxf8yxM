silence your cell phones now sympathy marchers,0.19050536
i'm very aware of that mr,0.0818759
hoover what i do know is,0.038886905
he's non-violent,0.265885
what i need to know right,0.036556464
now what's martin luther king about to do next what's going on youtube,0.10861191
welcome back to the movie experience,0.098750666
and yes i know i said that the movie experience,0.0729715
uh is only on the weekends we gotta catch up on the new movies every weekend,0.10130741
but this time it is a very historical day,0.06370714
this is martin luther king jr holiday and today we are going to review,0.11271706
some of the martial kingdom movies and i'm doing one of my favorite movies hands down uh i thought this is one of the best uh interpretations of martin king jr story and that is selma summer is directed by avery duvernay who is famously known for directing uh some of the great stuff like we see a documentary netflix called 13 that was a a great documentary as well i know she did a wrinkle in time and a lot of things people weren't wearing today movie like that but uh someone when it first came out this is this put every dude on the mat because it was between either her elite daniels doing this movie and leave dance to at the time took note to do the butler,0.06595034
now don't get wrong,0.088749275
i do enjoy the butler,0.0981713
and i think i the butler i will be reviewing for black history month as well,0.42247328
but when it comes to some i think ava junior was the perfect one to to capture this,0.080155075
so this is the story of martin king during 1965 during the uh when he's trying to go for the voting rights uh act we get to vote right next in 1965 but we would go for uh african-americans right to vote down in selma alabama,0.24221016
so we're only taking place in this one section of water king side,0.062556595
martin king has a very hefty life obviously,0.25494817
and one day i know people would like to see a whole movie of a brainstem but there are some so many events in martin king's life that weren't just a detailed one movie type thing for instance boycott,0.17629237
starring,0.063544914
jeffrey white was the hbo when we got back in 2001,0.26306757
they had just to focus on the montgomery bus boycott,0.15222606
and i was thinking like one thing you can do with it with monitor king if you can't make a full movie and like because it's going to be a long movie i think it needs to be like and kind of like an mcu kind of series and thing where different sections of his events of his life that they can take a movie to focus on that like the boycott,0.11479874
uh birmingham and then you know nobel peace prize and then selma to chicago vietnam like there's so many things you could do to stick it all up in there,0.15193647
i was wondering somebody may do that,0.0600559
but uh this is starring dave royello as the role of martin luther king and uh we making her return to uh at the cinema because she played coretta scott king in uh boycott,0.07395264
she comes back to play correct scott king again as a karma eldrigo i know i pronounced that her name wrong always do,0.14311872
and this was a a movie written by paul webb and also produced by oprah winfrey,0.10913955
so let's get on into some i'm gonna get into the good i'm gonna get to the bed and i'm gonna get into,0.49216166
well the sport this movie came out it's old right now,0.082481176
and i did not have a youtube channel around when this movie was out,0.14137417
so i i just it came out late 2014 went into movie theaters in january 2015,0.088416114
and then my youtube channel didn't start until may of 2015,0.07970895
so i never got around to reviewing it,0.10420214
so now i get it going,0.06733685
so now start off with the good starting off david o'yellow and captures the spirit of martin luther king jr,0.07629539
there have been a lot of people that played dr,0.0775589
martin luther king i like paul winfield the ministers even though i think the ministers was terrible i do like uh jeffrey white and boycott,0.25386098
but he represents more than young king this uh the real world represents a lot of the season martin luther king jr,0.033481855
and i i enjoyed that him and um what we just seen in my range black bottom uh coleman domingo who plays ralph abernathy those two really capture the essence of martin king,0.15752478
and rob that nothing in their friendship everybody does a great job that because since i am into this era history,0.15415727
and i just study it she brings out characters,0.09955328
and first of all this was cast wonderfully everybody that plays the part of their characters looks like their character would back in 1965. and a lot of times with these big cell rice movies you get the big names you get the monster kings you get the ralph albinos you get to andrew young's but there's a lot of people that played a part in this that you do not necessarily get and she went out and she is uh teaching the audience of all these other uh heroes in the civil rights movement and young heroes and older heroes people that doesn't know about such as common plays of the reverend james bevel who's not really mentioned in a lot of movies but he's just documentaries a lot of people don't watch america sometimes they think they're boring uh tessa thompson plays diane nash,0.2692553
he does a great job as dying nashes also they bring in at john lewis,0.12588428
now john lewis,0.061202977
obviously we know about john lewis,0.066634394
a lot of people know more more about the royal jungle especially after this past year,0.05521015
and of course you know a lot of people really love know john those but they don't but they bring she brings,0.17988639
john williams in here hosea williams comes to my jimmy lee jackson played by the keith stanfield who did a great job as well fred gray and all and all these other people even uh james orange these are all sclc members that play an important part of what happened down in some alabama and going on into that,0.22365862
so i i like how she takes time to introduce us to a lot of new characters also while still putting the spotlight on on the main players but also putting the spotlight on number two and show that they they had a significant role in this uh plot and one thing i liked about the movie also is that it wasn't just okay this this place is a problem we're going to march,0.109445736
uh we're going to piss the white folks off we're going to get our rights to vote,0.77008134
and that's what that's what's going to be no evidence,0.0757913
humanizes these things because you got to understand that in this time,0.23266366
there's a lot going on and every time just like the whole town is against you you are a mark in that town you coming in there into their eyes to stir up trouble,0.29181808
so you're already a marked man to be dead,0.5154597
she shows the uh the human side of martin king in this movie where he's not a martyr,0.31011721
he's not the saint that a lot of people put him up to be,0.14715703
and because you know he was nonviolent that that king has flaws like every human being on this earth has flaws,0.3020011
okay and you know some are greater than others,0.097093455
you know say and even even with him doing so much good he had flaws,0.2663159
and he he was scared a lot of times and it's going into it,0.13724557
we look like a history like wait they took care of their problem to 68 but it king's eyes he was supposed to be dead that day,0.19465886
so she brings a lot of uh human aspects to it even when uh it comes to the fbi and you know being under the letter to correct his house about him cheating on her like that was a very tough scene that she did put in the movie it was also the scene where malcolm x comes to selma and then he didn't like michael mix coming to someone's turn of all the shuttle trouble of all the good,0.11099714
they have done down south because he was all up in the north and they don't usually put that or talk about that when they talk about selma when it comes to that kind of moves like that or even small kind of documentary,0.07012909
so those those things as somebody who watched me i appreciate that i grabbed on today,0.15553717
and i loved all of it and it wasn't that you know black folks all unified at that time,0.6008613
they showed that the slick didn't like sclc coming down and getting up in their business,0.21659638
they felt as though that they they could do a job at an sclc,0.43565956
but the people wanted scf martin kenny come down,0.2404209
that's why you know uh james farmer and john lewis it was clashing his i like seeing it it it it shows you know reality everybody's not just like because we're black we all go get we're going to get along and go out there,0.5237313
and do this that's the same thing what's going on in this country right,0.10491121
now just because everybody's black and you feel it was like okay,0.5154597
well you can actually different people with black lives matter means and you'll get 13 different answers okay,0.7093121
so there's always so many different ways to try to handle things,0.06799732
but you know they're going to be a difference of opinion and she put and she put that in there,0.06653203
and i think that was um that was really good uh tim roth comes uh comes here as joe uh george wallace i think he did a great job as that like he made me really hate him,0.5154597
so that that that was his uh his job in here and he got a lot of a lot out of name after that you play smaller roles but they are bigger actors that are playing a part oprah winfrey,0.10034792
cooper good junior just named this name a few so they were uh really really good in the movie now i could go i really can go on all day about this movie what i would not now stop and talk about how many days,0.12733102
i like let's get into some of the things about the bad that you know that probably you know could have been done better,0.14539775
so when it comes to the bed some of the things i like that there was these slow motion shots that even do when they use to the point,0.25075692
i was just like i understand it's trying to capture the moment in the impact and i think it just went on just a little bit too long,0.09178473
i'm not i'm afraid look i watch that sniper stuff okay,0.31089434
so i i'm a fan of slow motion stuff but there were times i was just like just uh pick it up just a little bit,0.109678276
it comes like just a little bit too long,0.1553231
but you know see it doesn't doesn't hurt the movie by no means at all,0.05675652
and it's a personal thing of mine,0.08496943
it's just like um,0.075535916
every time we do a period piece movie where we talk about one certain thing we we get all the details leading up to it,0.07104905
but then when we get to the end like like the victory march,0.062174365
we kind of rushed through the end and i'm like i would have liked to see you know whenever it makes it the end and then him he said make it into the it did the march from summit to montgomery that he did the speech at the montgomery capitol,0.14860992
but i would like to them see the voter you know have them signed,0.03934504
and then johnson signed the voter rights act,0.069152765
and you know um,0.05935231
how some of the people that came down there to help them out i mean they did talk about a lot of people,0.12061525
they know a lot of the people that came down to help like james reid,0.1631587
you know the white uh pastor that came down who was killed,0.4582108
so they do go in today,0.041719645
and like these are nitpicks of mine because of how into the history,0.18921052
i am but those certain things,0.068847
i probably couldn't you know enjoy enjoy a little bit more but guys uh but then uh there really is no spoilers i'm gonna say if people say this movie's about five years old and there's really no sports,0.14915197
it's really going by the history of it,0.050612077
so there's really no experience of sports,0.05590237
i'm not i'm gonna cut that part out uh i'm just gonna tell you right now that you i recommend you guys go out there and check out some i can really go on and on about this all one day,0.44261402
this is one of the best monitor king movies they ever made,0.07051739
i i really think that when it comes to his life when it comes to a a period piece for each part of his life as a movie that would be good like a whole kind of anthology type thing using same actors,0.28007594
i'm cool,0.07410644
it kind of like an mcu type thing as opposed to making one long movie because there are a lot of points,0.10752326
that's going to be left out,0.06931561
everybody needs to be in there such as the michael makes movie i love the malcolm x movie,0.040691767
and uh like i said macabre is a little bit more easier to do because of what happened in his life,0.2318281
but there was still portions of the michael mix movie that they left out and i'm just like because it was already over in a three-hour territory,0.085786246
i'm just like see it it could have been done,0.07224798
you know like that that whole one night in miami,0.09876424
they took that whole part out,0.08023584
you know saying him and catches clay thing i was i kind of want to see that,0.08829228
but i'm telling you guys right,0.056755602
now i'm going to give selma a complete nerdgasm i recommend you guys go out there ron king day check out some if you guys have not seen some already you're going to see certain things,0.534093
check out boycott king was the mainstream that came out 1978 and me personally it's it's so badly,0.19221228
written it really is paul winfield systems do a great job,0.049413968
but it's so badly written and the story's all over the place especially for people who know the story i'm gonna say you can go watch if you want to they they play it every year on tv,0.12683523
one or bt or so you go check it out,0.10603173
