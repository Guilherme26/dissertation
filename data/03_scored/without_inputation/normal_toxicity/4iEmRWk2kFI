hello,0.054463096
everybody I am Tiffany,0.051039025
and today I am doing another movie review let's go I'm kind of dressed up right not really nice no stuff as I would like to be you because I was really trying to get specific items,0.1233076
I kind of find anywhere,0.0886765
but I really need to do this movie review before is I completely escape to my head,0.10893329
this is just going to have to do,0.050250713
it's not really an outfit at all but the color kind of fits it,0.18897319
I guess I don't know maybe it doesn't but to me it does,0.0759349
so that's what's important is that in my heart,0.07916717
I meant for it to match this movie the movie I am discussing,0.14879258
and reviewing today is Logan the new x-men movie that came out a little while ago,0.18673894
I didn't see it where he was actually in theaters which is really sad,0.058448497
because I work at the movie theatres and it was in theaters while I've been working there but did I go see it,0.06177026
no,0.06626663
I didn't good job',0.11020342
but I saw it on on-demand and decided to watch it with me Familia and you have a really fun time I was super excited,0.18193801
I love superhero movies I'm not like super up-to-date on comics or anything like that so I don't pretend to be like the super duper fans who like read the comics along with it and they know exactly what comic is face office,0.17026342
I'm not that but I do enjoy superhero movies and I have people who have read the comics and they kind of catch me up on the backstory of stuff that they don't live in the movies so in the excellent franchise,0.09555262
this was a very special movie because I believe in a huge Ackman last movie is Wolverine,0.09770785
it kind of makes sense that it would be if you've seen it,0.07230695
you know what I mean and then will be lived up to the epicness like it should because Hugh Jackman is awesome,0.16936779
and is there's an awesome final last movie of Wolverine because he's done an excellent job with that role so Hugh Jackman fabulous job if you couldn't tell by that I loved this movie it was so good very intense,0.10050722
it is definitely a darker take on the comics marvel is usually very light and fun and has a little bit of humor in it has dramatic moments,0.09940758
but is known more for their lighter side,0.041959953
and the more action side and does have plenty of action,0.034803096
trust me,0.0658904
it has a lot of action sequences in there but it also has a more soul and darker tone,0.069437794
there aren't a lot of funny moments really very very few there's very few in this,0.055863153
it's kind of like dark night a little bit,0.20523442
you're not going in there to have a happy-go-lucky time it was definitely a very intense movie it's at I can definitely see people crying in this,0.14051361
so bring tissues just in case,0.10422707
and all the characters are just so awesome,0.028716618
you have a couple returning you have new ones a lot of new ones for those of you who won sophistic it has an eight point three out of ten on IMDB,0.433235
do you know how insane that is it is on IMDB top 250 movies now you know,0.46700108
how hard that is to do oh my gosh that means that there is another movie out there that was on that list that was 250 and it's up folks I'm sorry I'm so sorry to that movie I'm pretty sure you are fantastic,0.16253118
I have a lot of superhero movies on that list a whole lot,0.06844852
there's a couple,0.042596694
there's blogan now big Avengers Dark Knight,0.060395136
I just know those three for sure that are on that list for those of you who want to know the actors it starts of course Hugh Jackman as Wolverine who else DA has Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier as you always is,0.07517202
and it also introduces a new actress,0.08274385
Daphne King soon amazing job,0.10522877
oh my gosh love her so young,0.20257416
she's so awesome has a lot of awesome other people in it too I would HIGHLY highly highly recommend this again,0.09671683
if you are looking for a happier movie this is not the best route to go,0.08983245
it's not going to make you feel happy and warm and bubbly after you leave it's going to make you feel kind of depressed,0.3282462
I feel like super duper like bawling your eyes out half an hour later but still depressed and potentially a couple tears well the plot of the thurible,0.27240226
if you see in the x-men movies it follows of course,0.11953127
the Wolverine on the story you had a couple standalone movies as well before this one this one cuts to many many many years in the future,0.08089191
when stuff has gone awry,0.08888278
I don't really want to spoil you too much,0.27362916
you should really go into this blind and not really what's happening,0.40952677
but the main thing you should know is that it is many many many many many years into the future,0.051046487
so that's why things seem really different,0.051892843
it's not like this has happened a year or two from the last movie is action drama,0.08262445
sci fi has been born at a time,0.19406134
it's not bad or really at all,0.07902802
so don't worry about that,0.09978529
so if you like action yes you'll love it if you don't like action,0.18359254
well just watch it anyways for the story because the story is amazing,0.031213038
it's really all I can tell you without completely spoiling you so I'm going to go ahead and jump into the spoilery section,0.48610267
okay,0.050967902
thank you,0.039406788
for joining me today non,0.107251436
spoilery people go watch Logan and then come back and we can talk about all the fields and everything on it together have a good day goodbye,0.11555388
I know it's not supposed,0.048788033
but you know why I made up one,0.08716435
so I don't have the clause,0.09538844
I really want a clause,0.05126189
so I went into this expecting it to be bad because I have been warned at least of that that it is very dark and depressing compared to the other x-men movies,0.21955569
and that's totally fine,0.0609134
you need those dark night moments,0.1637887
especially in comic book movies because those are so bright so deep if you're not expected to be as depressing as it was I gotta say and the engine shocked me I got a bit hit hope that says automatically at the beginning is just that this very curious depressing town because the very opening scene is of course Wolverine is getting attacked by these guys who are trying to steal his car which is a very dumb move,0.55771875
and he's fighting them,0.17958596
but just something seems off,0.06402913
he's not healing as fast,0.12504585
and he seems to be hurting more than usual,0.1902881
when the guys hit him for just kind of wondering the whole time what exactly happened to the x-men and why isn't he at the school teaching,0.16602646
why is he a driver now and everything like that,0.0870582
it's really really confusing,0.05139229
it was just so depressing because I was kind of excited because I was really hoping that I would see some of the other x-men in this movie but you basically find out right at the beginning that all the rest of them are dead and it's really Wolverine and Charles Xavier,0.24168484
and the creepy guy who can hunt down,0.55787075
mutants Calvin Calvin Gus's name Calvin,0.264942
and you find out there hasn't either then mutant children in the 25 years or something like that and you're just like what's going on what happened where's magneto and sore and Cyclops we just goes back and but it's really there what if he cycle but he's dead again,0.31089434
oh gosh oh I was really sad,0.15350673
and on top of that you find out Professor X is having these seizures that basically can kill everybody so that's really fun,0.6304055
too,0.030334655
I did find out information that was interesting because you know I have friends who read the comics and everything,0.07241581
and so I was actually informed that in the comics,0.062352464
I mean they hand shattered,0.15032953
they never fully said it but it was Professor X in one of the comments that actually kill are the x-men because he had one of those seizures and the Wolverine could heal himself so he was okay but the rest of them couldn't,0.30224645
so they all ended up dying,0.46950018
and I wasn't thinking into that,0.11399362
but I did hear that in the actual comics that Wolverine is the one that kills them all,0.62505156
I don't know,0.1431935
if any of you guys have read the comics,0.11705894
but if you have you can talk about it below a little bit because I'd like to know that in more detail because I'm not going to hunt down those comics and figure out exactly what happened,0.094166875
so it's that stuff,0.071829244
I like but like lip spoiler can't email people don't want to read about the comics themselves and don't want to be spoiled for them,0.19088568
and then you find out that there are other mutant children out there you come across Laura who is played by Daphne was amazing,0.16238375
amazing,0.037814368
Wolverine takes her in and promises to get her to this place called Eden but you're kind of wondering this whole time what is her power exactly and I was like shocked when I found out that she basically is Wolverine junior girl version and she's more enhanced in a way because she had claws coming out of her feet Wolverine only has at hand she has them in her feet too,0.11707684
I was like wait a second did Wolverine have a kick,0.31089434
I was really confused I did not expect that to be her power out of everything,0.07607572
so I was freaking out and thinking it was awesome,0.27014834
and she was awesome like those fight sequences that she had especially at the beginning when they attack them in Mexico oh my god that was so good almost time to watch her because she's just a little little spunky thing and she's gonna grow little new,0.5133616
it's really cool,0.05239943
and I wish I had those girls a little bit but I don't,0.43518808
and then the whole time I was like okay so she's gotta be boring kid healthy sorta miss but isn't she's like a clone actually did not,0.31089434
but I was ed said that he had a kid and I was like this is gene great kid,0.11434726
I'm gonna cut up,0.43136996
I have these psychic powers along with the claws like I was determined for life to happen,0.09225392
because if you don't know who she and gray is because you haven't left me other x-men movies for some reason she's the main love interest for loking,0.25177887
he's with Cyclops,0.08297199
technically and she never breaks up the Cyclops never will but Logan has a crush on her and wants to be with her,0.14464577
there's been a gap since the last movie and this one and she was alive last time I saw because they revs arrested her and everything does that mean that they had a kid and he didn't know about,0.15065311
and the kid got captured I was going down that hole and I erupted that is not true family but I really wanted it to be true which is bad because I love Cyclops at the same time I wanted her to actually be Logan daughter,0.18817233
that's why I just really wanted to actually be looking sorry,0.058968488
and Professor X didn't help because he's like that's your daughter Logan and I'm like oh I'm right,0.31702626
I'm right but no find out that you have all of these young mutant kids that were in this facility and being tortured and basically turned into weapons and then they escaped and are heading off to eat in logan task now is to bring laura to eating,0.32340887
and he has to bring professor x with him which is scary in itself,0.2881426
because his seizures and everything and i loved how the movie didn't because i didn't know when they were going to happen,0.12638098
but he did it so well in moments where you were just not expecting it at all like the main one was when they were in that hotel he has the seizure all of a sudden and you see everybody's like frozen and the whole time you're just watching Logan struggle to try and get to that hotel room so he can stop professor eggs from killing everybody that's being probably tortured me out of all the other scene,0.46952707
you're just walking you move in and you're like can you move just a little bit faster,0.4380093
he couldn't move faster,0.09863541
not like everybody's gonna die,0.6488328
there's gonna be a whole scene,0.06392086
this is not okay,0.07500408
and then the action sequence was really cool because he comes in and he's like boom like that could have guys,0.09922457
and then they fall under dead,0.5154597
and I was just like this is,0.051264558
so cool,0.03968372
oh my gosh stop the seizure from happening,0.24527042
please he just had a sense of dread,0.15324433
everywhere they went,0.05732234
because when they hope that one family on the side of the road,0.06567693
I was kind of what Wolverine and I was like we should really move on because I was gonna happen to the family the way this movie is going,0.12640128
and what do you know,0.05156239
I was right,0.06452806
though I did think for a second that the kid was actually going to be another mutant,0.24217218
you would see Laura's like powers and then human be like oh my gosh look what I can do,0.23702133
and then he joins them or something like that,0.107976
I'm not sure but I do not think all of them would survive,0.24942999
I was clearly right,0.051167745
I did not expect to be their clone of Logan that is stronger and how he should be in the sense,0.103071794
and I was just terrified at that thing because asking was just plain unstoppable it was it was scary okay you're not going to beat yourself,0.39697558
I'm sorry that other self is way stronger than you,0.37612692
and then a shock came for me at that moment though that thing that duplicate kills Professor X and I was so mad,0.36019248
I was like no we only have two people that are left in this mutant world,0.317986
well three now but still I'll be original you're going to kill one of those right,0.69542736
now there is not okay and who is Professor X out of all the people that you just killed I was so pissed and I was really sad because he was dying and Logan was trying to save them,0.600408
but there was nothing that Logan to do you know I'm like now,0.06271609
it's just human Laura,0.14528659
and then Logan also knows that evening is actually a thing from the comics which was frustrating,0.058981255
I was like there's no such thing as hidden,0.085498706
you gotta be kidding me and I'm just panicking whew the whole entire time,0.23960741
because I'm like they're gonna get Laura and he's going to have to try down,0.14056517
and this is not going to be good,0.11006726
ha is a better than that was me,0.13137199
that was me during the whole movie basically okay this was one comedic part for me was when Laura finally speaks Logan Gibson because he's like you can't show off this whole entire time,0.12947462
and then she just goes on a rant in Spanish and I was laughing hysterically - me / Laura you are awesome and,0.088221
kicking,0.34865046
butt yes I,0.7127942
loved it and then also during all of the sudden happening you have this impending genome with Wolverine because he's not healing well and that's,0.10158184
really scary but you don't know exactly what is going on,0.13808757
with him and you don't know if they're going to,0.116433494
make it but of course they were able to get him to the Eden which was kind of Eden but not really and the kids are the ones who end up nurturing him back to health in a sense and you're just like,0.10037184
yes okay everything's gonna,0.1044435
be okay Wolverines going to go let them,0.094541125
protect them everything's going to,0.05649849
be good and there's going to be a whole new little,0.043478962
mutants game but then the last sequence came up and oh my gosh I was super intense and heartbreaking and intense again Laureen who wakes up and realizes that that these kids are going to get captured and so Wolverine takes the medicine all at once which he was not supposed,0.0913742
to do and you have this moment of old Wolverine where he's so strong and unstoppable,0.09858317
and it's this really nice battle sequence because you have him and then you have Laura both kicking butt together and working together and I know she's not his daughter in a sense but it was like father and daughter working together then the medicine starts to wear off and let's do the Logan clothes Dylan is dead and he's beating him to a pulp and got run oh my gosh thought run was so pitiful at the end,0.49306768
and I was just like this is so fast,0.07688313
I paced disintegrating basically back to where he was at the beginning but work is so painful to watch and so emotional because you see him fighting and you have all the other mutants coming together,0.16248438
they're so young but they're fighting for Wolverine to protect him and for each other,0.11586406
and they come together and finally repeat that stupid Logan clones but the real low game is so injured that they cannot do anything for him,0.8060606
and you just have this such emotional tender moment between him and Laura where she's crying and not wanting him to go away because he is her guy in a sense,0.24178445
you just don't realize fully what's going to happen until it does because I don't know about you,0.19818631
but in superhero movies I don't expect my main character to die,0.27842546
and so I'm like he's going to be okay,0.10724178
they're going to have one of the mutants like heal him or something,0.1646514
and he's going to be fine and he's going to lead them to the border and everything's going to be fine but it wasn't okay,0.13064948
I cried I literally cried because Wolverine died he's going to be resurrected or something because that's what they did in Superman,0.2914541
so what you'll be doing with Wolverine,0.13566414
but no they ended with him dying,0.30271524
and I was just sitting there in silence for a good ten minutes afterwards and hearing my mom go like that did that was funny that saw me out of it that that was funny she literally was really upset that he died in that with it and I tried to explain her it was hit the last movie but she was like that's not okay that he died and she walked away pretty angry that night that that was how it ended with him suck all of them,0.6364068
it's more than just him dying by himself because a Wolverine has been a central figure of the x-men franchise for such a long time,0.18199508
and so that in itself is really hurtful but also knowing that he was the last original x-men and the last original guys,0.10793533
and this the stars these whole new mutants which is cool and giving white to future x-men possibilities and new mutants and everything but it's still so sad that all of the originals are dead,0.4033407
now ah I'm going to miss them,0.0881522
and the thing about that character is that it's such an iconic character,0.08561422
there's not really anybody else,0.06576349
I feel like that can take Hugh Jackman's place as Wolverine,0.097667575
I don't they are going to because I know they're doing younger versions of some of the x-men people now like Cyclops and Jean Grey Sansa Stark is Jean Grey people,0.15401432
I don't know if they're actually going to do a younger Wolverine,0.15390691
look out of all the characters Hugh Jackman has been the central figure of that and he's done so much with Wolverine and you've come to his close but I'm guessing they're going to fill that gap basically between that time and go back and refer a very and fill in some other time places that they can because we're doing younger versions of everybody,0.087308265
I will say I was really sad that Wolverine died and that broke my heart but it was still a really good send-off makes me want to go back to the beginning of x-men,0.34872088
and see everything he's done the best,0.07133009
thank you,0.039406788
Hugh Jackman from being an awesome awesome Wolverine that is really all I have to say about this movie it was so incredible very emotional intense has little cute moments has very very depressing moments,0.15652885
but it's still so good and a great send-off to Wolverine and what Hugh Jackman has done with that character,0.0948494
thank you so much for watching this,0.052824777
if you have any other book or movie recommendations you can leave them in the comments below and I'll write them down check them out and make sure I do review on them for you,0.15226857
thank you,0.039406788
so much,0.05356845
for everything have a wonderful day evening night afternoon whatever time of the day,0.07038484
you are watching this end,0.12475333
don't forget to be awesome and watch Wolverine and if you have Wolverine claws oh my gosh show me them because I want some like to put on the hip that'd be so much fun,0.24036744
alright have a good day goodbye,0.11647098
whew,0.047186736
