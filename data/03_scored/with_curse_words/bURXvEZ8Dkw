del Toro and stars Sally Hawkins as Eliza who is mute and works at a,0.166914
facility where Michael Shannon and other workers bring in this creature from South America that,0.11975696
lives in the water it's like at The Creature from the Black Lagoon or the,0.14579125
creature from Hellboy that's why first thought of when I saw this creature and she,0.39626384
builds a connection and relationship with this creature because he sees her for who she,0.24235785
is he doesn't understand that she is mute and she can't speak so he doesn't,0.1530768
have that idea about her so there she builds this connection because she really feels,0.09557649
like she is missing something in her life she feels like she is just not,0.16869007
part of something and having this creature in her life it kind of fills that,0.35487896
void and makes her feel a part of something well she was like how this,0.16769144
creature is being treated so she tries to break this creature out of this facility,0.29983917
so she can care for this creature I was really looking forward to this movie,0.20556964

she meets this creature and she feeds him eggs and she kind of plays music,0.5801937
for him and teaches them sign language you feel that her character has shifted into,0.08967579
someone completely different than we have witness in the beginning part of the film that's,0.029387314
all due to the relationship between her and this creature she's not scared of him,0.27530342
