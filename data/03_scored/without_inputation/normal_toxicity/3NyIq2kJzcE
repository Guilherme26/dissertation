[Applause],0.045291696
it is time to talk about a big one,0.07711414
it's the latest installment in the DCE you wonder woman this one's a pretty big deal for the Studio One because Batman or Superman and Suicide Squad didn't exactly live up to expectations and then too because it is a thousand time we get a female at superhero movie that being said I was really hoping director patty Jenkins would just completely knock it out of the park with this one it isn't perfect Wonder Woman is still a fantastic film for a number of reasons the movie takes place way before the events of Batman for Superman during World War one Diana is living a fairly quiet life hidden away on the island of samos Karen until Steve Trevor's plane crashes in that area after hearing about the war and all the evil taking place in the world beyond that mascara from Steve Diana decides it is time to leave home and do what she can to save the world alright,0.15376544
so let's kick things off with some things that work really well,0.26082176
and there's really no better place to start than with gal gadot performance the times of doubting her acting chops are over,0.1531566
she is just so great and perfectly cast as Wonder Woman she sold strong and confident and bbs,0.15953009
and now here we go back to a time when Diana is first learning what she's capable of and what the world is like,0.10225521
and the dot does a great job playing in that range you believer is a fish out of water,0.12750022
and the same is true when she's a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield another great bit of casting,0.15380326
it's Chris Pine brass is because he became a familiar name via a big franchise with 2009 Star Trek,0.05008184
but this guy really deserves even more credit than he gets he is just one,0.22596753
heck of an actor who always brings more to the roles he gets than what's on the page originally and Wonder Woman is no different,0.2946497
not only does he have great chemistry with gadot,0.10731014
but he also has great chemistry with everyone around him and for particular supporting characters,0.05636124
that's the main reason they make an impression Samus Kara is also a big highlight of the film it is just,0.04178796
so refreshing to see some frightful visuals and some really strong and majestic female heroes particularly Robin Wright the lifestyle and history of Emma Skye are also super interesting and appealing,0.122590624
and it's the location of one of the best fight sequences in the entire film only downside to all,0.08941061
this is that I wish more of wonder women to play here,0.26415583
but there's still some funds we had beyond the mascara because another big win and Wonder Woman is the humor,0.08502072
it speaks to give a performance her chemistry with pine,0.13621825
the two of them just really play off each other,0.12101403
so so well when it comes to all those jokes about Stan and not understanding the basics of human life and life in London that quality of Diana also comes into play in a really interesting way with war,0.1507589
she basically processes everything as good versus bad if innocence are in need of help you help them,0.15313002
it's as simple as that and it is a really inspiring,0.1049488
and refreshing thought process that we don't get to see too often,0.085055485
it's a really powerful component of the film alright so before moving over to the negatives,0.056080874
I think it is important to reiterate a movie can have fuzz and still be great,0.1288103
so that being said want to Wonder Woman's flaws is pacing particularly in the second half it's long and it does start to feel like it after we leave some mascara the color palette is a little bit dark and dreary,0.14923275
and some of the quieter conversation driven moments aren't really as engrossing as they need to be,0.06113447
and it's tough to talk villain without getting into spoilers but I will say that while Wonder Woman has an excellent concept for the villainy featured in the film just isn't executed as well as we could have been,0.12222541
but again flaws,0.086377345
aside,0.05964758
this is the movie we needed Wonder Woman is getting a three and a half on the Dewey Decimal scale because it's got a fantastic lead performance an ensemble that has so much chemistry and perhaps more important than anything,0.107880354
because Wonder Woman is oozing with heart and positivity you get to root so hard,0.1899062
to leave for the Niro you get to feel inspired and then you get to leave with a whole lot of hope for what's to come in the DC EU,0.14212613
I can't wait to see what the studio's do with this character moving forward,0.050083105
and I can't wait to see Wonder Woman again,0.15487997
