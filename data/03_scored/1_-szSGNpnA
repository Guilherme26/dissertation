go back and watch my archive go back and watch mark I actually should be,0.15383844
a above right now go back and watch those trailer review trailer reactions because I,0.14396814
talked a lot about it but my gosh she was better than I ever thought,0.18475166
she could be I never thought she would have that inner and and I mean,0.20718357
that was the most respect she was amazing she was Wonder Woman oh my gosh,0.18734325
the ladies and gentlemen the story was done so well guys you guys are let,0.0700864
me break this down watching gal on the island of the mascara was dope the,0.26801848
costumes won't point guys I really felt like I was there watching the sisters the,0.1050915
Amazon warriors care for that woman that girl that little that little baby was amazing,0.39201236
I love the fact that we got a chance to see the the the Amazons,0.07372405
and there were all different different cultures you know I mean they were all one,0.0902576
they were also super they're all different cultures I love the costume design I love,0.07060396
how they had like the black the sisters the black ones and their hair they,0.43333223
didn't they didn't they didn't look fake you know I mean they didn't look fake,0.25849035
at all I didn't they look authentic they had the thick hair but they put,0.099515446
it back till they combed it it was perfect I loved every bit of it,0.31089434
dope gal though stood out like a sore thumb and I mean in a good,0.31089434
way when she spoke there at home that accident works that accident I never was,0.10382957
against accident now oh I love the fact when when when they stay true to,0.08535012
the character in that form that accent worked because it made her even more exotic,0.09193951
watching you you felt she was authentic she'll authentic Amazon and I loved every bit,0.15092534
of it she did her thing with that she truly from beginning from seeing her,0.100434095
from the beginning she truly made me believe that she's one a woman I believe,0.15245181
she was wondering when I was about to be Superman but when I got a,0.09224664
chance to see the origin of her I was like oh my god she's really,0.12555341
Wonder Woman because she stood for everything one of them instead for and it's not,0.17031805
just power just as in truth autocrat like that it's the woman she was young,0.14978379
but she was a sister she was a hunt she was a cousin she was,0.23157853
a grand mom she she was all the women in the world and you can,0.42329225
fill it off of her she was perfect perfect when she met Chris Pines Steve,0.2133947
Trevor it was I I kid you not guys it was magic it was magic,0.19481324
watching those two on screen together they had a great chemistry this movie has a,0.0623049
lot of good chemistry those two it was like I kid you not it was,0.08343256
like watching them from just watching this like watching this show and you see them,0.08072101
and it shows on for ten years and you watch them grow and have kids,0.15375483
in the family that's how it was that chemistry was perfect it was it was,0.06621509
innocent it was sweet it was funny it was caring it was sad it was,0.09497687
every emotion you can have and you can see him this has to be Chris,0.068433605
Pines probably the best role he's ever done because you can see the acting chops,0.065924846
he has I see two actors she's actor to actor is an actor that elevated,0.28840867
their skills to the max in this film and my gosh it worked I felt,0.12350048
like those two knew that they're going to show up the world and they both,0.044096615
on the same page with it and it worked that chemistry between those two was,0.040937018
beautiful I loved every bit of it guys I mean it was so sweet watching,0.16517535
them it was dope was the same it was it was it was three scenes,0.15204626
that I will never forget and I loved I have to say a little bit,0.16890939
something it was a scene you guys see when they're not when when they showed,0.13062093
them in like a like a water room or something like that like a little,0.15446283
cave or something was probably one of the funniest things that I ever experienced in,0.08941138
a superhero I loved every bit of it because it wasn't necessarily meant to be,0.07128292
funny it was logical and it was dope at the same time because it was,0.13595584
real the movie felt real it felt real it was vibrant it felt real it,0.0646443
didn't feel like a comic-book movie it felt like it felt like a a Greek,0.15319854
mythology story that actually really happened it felt like a biblical story that actually happened,0.034167636
it worked guys my gosh it worked those two on camera magic shout out the,0.1495488
GAO shout-out to Chris Pine doing your thing that right there it's gonna be hard,0.13598269
to replicate that I've never seen that in a superhero movie never never beautiful beautiful,0.14383799
moments right there with them - oh my gosh I can't wait to talk about,0.14198811
him huh that was tight next the directing guys the directing oh my gosh this,0.28654158
uh you remember this the music the story chemistry the actors the actors and actors,0.0754563
chemistry the chemistry mixed with the story and the music this was a beautiful web,0.0542136
going on right now let's get into the director of the movie miss patty Jenkins,0.14854254
patty Jenkins outdid herself in this movie I remember we went back we went back,0.09936228
we go back let's go back a couple months right and I went to WonderCon,0.05409047
with my boys you know Judy Joe Savin Jackson you know ap5 we was there,0.080775715
it was a couple other people who didn't show up but we went we got,0.070779115
a chance to watch patty Jenkins and a couple of scenes of Wonder Woman I,0.18067858
was when I are your life when I saw that I was sold on the,0.15282863
movie when I saw a scene I was like oh my gosh this is tight,0.13602056
she explained what she was trying to do what she wanted to do with the,0.09053153
film she says she wanted to make a Richard Donner film she wanted to go,0.11918921
Casablanca and I see the Casablancas vibe with those two characters bad Wonder Woman and,0.34528127
Steve Trevor I see it I see it oh man I see it is there,0.055865698
she went that Lois and Clark bye I telling you guys is there it's beautiful,0.08036383
love right there so sorry so but when I got a chance to watch it,0.088097885
this woman I is amazing she knows how to capture the right scene at the,0.31089434
right time it's amazing guys from seeing the mascara the beautiful landscape watching the the,0.09852232
costume of the the Amazons and their costumes and looking so authentic such a beautiful,0.0897741
vibe the whole time watching young Diana as the issue is forget her name her,0.111412935
name is Emily something I can't remember but she played young Princess Diana she was,0.08171012
beautiful she's a little girl and she's a thorn her thing you could see the,0.4033927
the curiosity in her head you can see she wanted to be something greater for,0.13335955
someone to capture stuff like that that's amazing guys this project is that her thing,0.12335631
in this movie she directed so many scenes and they were all amazing I didn't,0.09726654
know she knew how to direct action guys I didn't know I was shocked the,0.08851004
action scenes in this movie are are on point I'm gonna be honest machine the,0.07444698
action seems to me personally and this is not being biased or anything the action,0.09860119
seems just basically say this take Winter Soldier right take Winter Soldier before Bucky takes,0.07516273
his mask off all that before Bucky takes his mask off take Winter Soldier and,0.24155271
then add it in with Man of Steel that's what you get you get a,0.06171197
complete believable facing because you know she's Wonder Woman so she gonna do things some,0.28093687
some things like Superman but the the the the choreography of the fight scenes are,0.079171866
like Winter Soldier so it works it works in the time frame it is dope,0.2800393
the actions she did her thing on those actions things the action scenes are on,0.08761034
point that right there was the shocker for me because before before I see what,0.08359961
I saw at WonderCon I was always worried about okay well she got a fight,0.12187715
how's she gonna get down you know I mean I know gal has a background,0.19836362
in military uh she was in a military so she has a background of that,0.09984033
military training all that stuff like that so I was like okay how they gonna,0.24055193
use her how are you gonna use her and they use their well she was,0.068074025
on point Wonder Woman action scenes were my god why I can't believe I'm gonna,0.14910015
say this this is real true spit was better than bad be Superman it was,0.34342432
better than the Batman warehouse scene it was better than that and let me explain,0.09160403
the reason why it was better than that is because it was God doing most,0.09795235
of that on some note some notes and then explained that the warehouse scene was,0.0776223
planned Batman planned that he knew I mean people was in a room he knew,0.13806164
this Wonder Woman was a warrior y'all she didn't count how many people on the,0.15900719
field didn't why didn't she just wait and served them all up that's why it,0.11504983
gets the edge of a Batman's fight scene for me because she went in there,0.15358545
with her eyes closed she was blindfolded and she handled business that's why she gets,0.11623847
the edge over the Batman V Superman fight scene now personally got all the Batman,0.08380049
scene I want the Fighting's I've seen when her soldier and that Batman warehouse was,0.08901154
on point no for real but wonder woman gets the cake on that y'all she,0.3409006
gets that that that fight scene was tight guys I was in the audience and,0.23989932
some stuff happened and I can I was tight and everybody's looking at me they,0.10694507
was looking at me I was like what you looking at that was trying I,0.09023097
was excited when I saw that man I was excited when I saw that that,0.082199715
was dope way anyway moving on actually sings on point hey Jenkins director dope that,0.4032739
was that was amazing I shocked shocked by how well this film was put together,0.06599627
in the chemistry base and it makes sense the director held his movie together but,0.026548747
casting didn't let nobody stop they helped they held it I felt like they held,0.10085316
each other together Chris was like you know God I know people hating on you,0.5154597
and I'm gonna help you out and she was like thank you and I'm gonna,0.18787827
make sure that what you do for me ain't gonna do it is it's like,0.104714796
that's how I felt like they were I felt like and I don't know if,0.09672396
this is true but I really felt like he was like a real friend to,0.13674976
her it was like look I know us a lot of haters out there but,0.30126557
we gonna make sure we give a hundred and thirty-five percent and you can feel,0.08339874
it you can see the way they looked at each other it was like a,0.07732407
real true friendship and they held each other together throughout this film with the support,0.05765144
of director and the story and the music shouts to Geoff Johns and the music,0.02909935
it was a great triangle guys it really worked this movie was tight I love,0.24122836
this movie guys this was a great film enjoyed it I can't wait to purchase,0.17107618
it I can't wait to watch it again I know personally I'm gonna watch this,0.122967504

I'm gonna enjoy it it's gonna be a great experience watching of multiple times this,0.08309838
film is dope guys please go watch this movie we need these type of movies,0.40658587
to grow because if they grow now Warner Brothers knows that's for real they need,0.064682946
to know this is how you make a movie because this gives other movies hope,0.086584814
the hope that we need the the the the spirit of the comic book world,0.08977616
for real keeping the 100 now a lot of people were saying that oh let,0.0642933
me get your great before I do that I give Wonder Woman that's what I,0.26433542
give this movie this is the best superhero origin film of all time as of,0.09313592
now nothing is topping this movie as of now people can argue but I'm explaining,0.23584536
