"Hey guys, this is my review for Dunkirk"
"Okay, Full disclosure"
Before the screening I ate a quinoa salad with a side of french fries because you need balance in life and I had half a glass of roses
My mood was rested and happy and my expectation for this film was very high
"I didn't know much about the historical context of Dunkirk before I saw the movie, so I did a little bit of research, and that proved to be pretty helpful because the movie doesn't give much context about what part of World War 2 this is happening in from the first frame"
though it is relentlessly suspenseful
"The fighting scenes are intense, but they're not gory or gratuitous"
Writer
Director Christopher Nolan really did an astonishing job of making it feel both real and epic
"newcomer Finn Whitehead, and Oscar winner Mark Ryland gave the standout performances"
But I have to admit Harry Styles
he wasn't bad
"In fact, he was pretty good"
"Okay, one small complaint, I couldn't always understand the dialogue because the accents are really thick and they're competing with the score and gunfire and aircraft, etc"
But that is truly my only complaint
I think that Dunkirk is an amazing cinematic experience and it is worth seeing
in 70 millimeter film
"There are 125 theaters across the country showing it that way, and if there's one near you, it is worth speaking out"
I hope you liked it
