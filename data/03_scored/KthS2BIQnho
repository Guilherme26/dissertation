I'm gonna record the review tonight I'm going to upload it tomorrow if you guys,0.15312481

and then give you my score tomorrow bumblebee that review will be coming out tomorrow,0.107626736
evening but right now we're talking spider-man so Miles Morales becomes the spider-man of his,0.18154185
reality and crosses paths with his counterparts from other dimensions to stop a threat to,0.10189093
all reality did I just read Miles Morales out loud as a description for a,0.09434077
movie that is currently coming to theaters is that not the most incredibly geeky and,0.12784852
nerdy and awesome thing you have ever heard this is a character that I've wanted,0.4650406
to see on screen for so long we've had plenty of iterations of Peter Parker,0.056896195
and I like a lot of the spider-man movies I'm a huge fan of spider-man,0.1676066
2 I'm a massive fan of spider-man homecoming there have been some absolute gems and,0.10792887
those two that I just mentioned in particular are two of my favorite superhero movies,0.06156897
of all time maybe throw them in towards the end of my top ten I'd,0.74077094
have to check it out and make sure but this movie had a lot to,0.0666137
live up to because it has those other spider-man movies to compete against and there's,0.096794546
a lot of hype for this thing looking on Rotten Tomatoes the score is that,0.23620172
100% I like the trailers a lot I liked them more as I watched the,0.052449655
newer ones I didn't love the first trailer I'm like I don't know if this,0.12430023
movie can necessarily do everything that people want it to do how is it going,0.06713629
to balance all of these characters you see somebody like spider-ham okay is he going,0.114629894
to come in gonna tell some stupid jokes and make this movie a bit more,0.78234535
cheesy than it needs to be there's just a lot to handle and I was,0.15161528
very worried that into the spider-verse could not handle it well a big slap on,0.24192479
the wrist for Austin because into the spider-verse did not just handle those things it,0.09159992
masterfully crafts all of those elements and brings us possibly I am NOT definitively saying,0.18560097
in this video because one I have to and - I may be releasing a,0.05659969
spider-man movies ranked list this might be at the top of my spider-man list this,0.10978861
movie was awesome and I'm not just saying that because everybody else is saying that,0.07503512
I watched Gotti a few months ago am I saying oh it's the worst movie,0.1765184
of the year it's rare when a movie lives up to that kind of high,0.06521667
but god he was one of the worst movies of the year it's same thing,0.34358013
with into the spider verse oh it's one of the best movies of the year,0.05642083
one of the best animated movies okay is there really going to be that good,0.08263693
guys I walk into the theater with my friend Dakota Rowe kind of rolling our,0.15294352
eyes like okay a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes you guys think you're getting it,0.23965566
this movie review stuff well well just prove me wrong right here I kid you,0.30441666
not my friend Dakota turned around looked me dead in the eyes after that movie,0.2733833
was over that may not just be my favorite spider-man movie of all time that,0.076765604
may be my favorite superhero movie of all time to be on that level and,0.07468312
I'm not completely disagreeing with and the movies fantastic to be on that level of,0.07345467
good you have to do a lot of things right so Austin what does into,0.07951809
the spider verse do right well like I said it handles all of these characters,0.09963105
but it doesn't just give you these characters and make them likable it gives you,0.10968588
a great voice actor behind them it gives you a reason to care each individual,0.17330928
character either gets an origin story or gets fleshed out to a tee and the,0.056985546
voice cast is perfect for all of them Jake Johnson as Peter Parker now there,0.080986865
are multiple iterations of multiple different Peter Parker's or Penny Parker's or Gwen Stacy's in,0.07508613
this movie but there are also a few that kind of slip in at the,0.082381286
beginning there's one and at the end there's one with some special voice talent that,0.058887616
you're not anticipating to hear in this movie so keep an ear out or keep,0.24110031
an eye out but keep an ear out for some very famous actors of note,0.10120482
playing some characters that you won't expect and then go check out I am to,0.08332151
be and see who they play after you watch the movie not before because you,0.14384955
will have a massive smile on your face when you hear their voice my goodness,0.19132382
there are so many little things like that in this movie that just make you,0.08618053
happy there are Easter eggs there are cameos if you pay attention to television screens,0.13812427
in the background blink and you will miss all of these things I may even,0.067876615
do a spoiler review for this move because there's just so much to talk about,0.062741846
especially when we're talking about the two and I'll go ahead and get into them,0.08219602
the two post-credit scenes mid-credits scenes the mid-credits scene very emotional it's great but the,0.05720174
post-credits scene may be the funniest most entertaining most jaw-dropping if you're a fan of,0.13238752
certain characters post-credits scene I have seen a long time and maybe one of the,0.06162563
best I've ever seen so if you leave before those credits roll just know that,0.14914137
you have made a grave mistake in your life and that is something that can,0.40037242
never be fixed unless you go watch the movie again then you can you can,0.087996215
stay that time and the amount of surprises I continue to get with this movie,0.06383603
I'm not gonna say what any of them are so it's hard to review this,0.21419309
film because there are so many little details and things that I want to talk,0.09372684
about just things that I want to tell you guys about you're gonna love this,0.14202735
and you're gonna love that but these are plot elements that I didn't really know,0.10925712
going in so I don't want to ruin the surprise for you guys I want,0.27680224
you to go in fresh I can save this I don't think this is a,0.13079695
spoiler I didn't know that they were going to be so many origin stories to,0.056020442
these characters in the film well guess what the way that they go about that,0.041954976
is brilliant but the way that they give that to us on screen I'm sitting,0.06296175
there like yeah this is a major surprise 10 minutes later another major surprise just,0.07023001
the way that they handle all of these characters I can't believe it was so,0.061546713
well crafted when I was going into the film thinking this thing could be an,0.05884379
absolute mess it was the opposite and yes you have the brilliant things that people,0.2062382
have been talking about and all of the reviews that I've read so far the,0.042458393
comic book elements the color scheme just the look and visuals in general it's one,0.07488053
of the best looking animated movies I've seen in a long time I love the,0.074486636
style of the characters I love when miles jumps off of a building you can,0.13141511
fit and this is an animated film guys you can feel the wind blowing against,0.17892739
his face and you can understand how epic this moment is just from what this,0.1939493
is showing us in animation and it's not even super realistic it's more surrealistic but,0.14621292
I love the style that they went for the backgrounds can be a bit to,0.081560664
get used to because at times they can be a little blurry but they manage,0.118719116
to shift the focus in a way that you know in the backyard while they,0.23181391
mean to do that because they're trying to focus your attention on something in the,0.11020237
forefront of the screen and every single spider-man every version whether it's by twin or,0.08045982
spider HAMP or spider noir their atmosphere their vibe their animation style it's all different,0.08451588
it's all cool I thought all of it worked from that to the voice cast,0.058809705
Nicholas Cage is in this movie he is great Hailee Steinfeld like I said Jake,0.10341408
Johnson shameik Moore as Miles Morales how can I forget about this guy this guy,0.4673007
starred in dope I thought dope wasn't pretty dope and then you have my Hershel,0.4446997
ollie has a very special character in there I thought he was real everyone Brian,0.09582214
Tyree Henry everyone was good there's not one bad actor in the bunch and there's,0.1644125
also not one bad song in the bunch this soundtrack the score all of it,0.24225323
works so well I was visually pleased I was audibly pleased everything you can possibly,0.16383801
think of I was sitting there just soaking it all in this was comic-book goodness,0.13091317
from the panel's popping up in the background to the sound effects to the words,0.07427732
coming on-screen we have never seen something like this the closest thing I've seen to,0.07145784
this you remember that videogame ultimate spider-man I had it on the Nintendo DS I,0.23984021
used to love that game you got the comic book panels you got the transitions,0.11756596
they tried it in live action with the 2003 Hulk that didn't work so this,0.044328973
the animation style animation in general is the way to go about it and they,0.06913675
went about it and they delivered on all of those aspects Austin are you going,0.07883159
to keep talking about positives yes because I have a lot just kidding I'll add,0.08637168
and one more thing I thought the villains selection was really cool and how they,0.15423971
managed that throughout all of the different universes and the color palette the color palette,0.026220005
was beautiful negatives like I said it might take a bit to get used to,0.13682485
the blurry background you might have to have your eyes adjust I liken it to,0.08867319
the lego movie and it's funny because we had Chris Miller and Phil lor the,0.12743732
same guys who did the lego movie and other than that I will say kingpin,0.18153831
while I really liked him I like lifts Schreiber ass kingpin I think he could,0.8606264
have been a bit more fleshed out as the villain although I wouldn't want to,0.12104245
take more time away from the characters that we know and love because I did,0.058686033
know and love those characters but I don't think kingpin was the most fleshed out,0.08383363
villain in the world otherwise I can't think of anything else don't you just hate,0.28763416
being all aboard the hype train sometimes don't you like standing out and being different,0.07083368
well I do but into the spider-verse it's just a movie I don't see anyone,0.08671893
disliking unless you hate spider-man as a character and by the way my friend also,0.4183721
looked at me and said Miles Morales is now my favorite spider-man and this guy,0.17550926
has been a Peter Parker fan for years smooth we might convert you of course,0.05657287
you're going to have many different characters to choose from all of that being said,0.0744367
and I can't believe I'm going to do it this movie is going to be,0.076597795
in my top 10 movies of the year most likely and I'm going to give,0.03226221
this film in 98 percent spider-man into the spider verse did everything it needed to,0.10625388
do and more it executed on the audience that it was intended for it's good,0.28292766
for kids it's good for adults it's good for comic book and non comic book,0.11311177
fans this movie is good for everyone and I'm probably going to go back and,0.123588406
see this again next weekend just to make sure I like it as much as,0.04782295
I think I do but my goodness this thing blew me away guys so what,0.327031
did you think of spider-man into the spider verse and have you even seen it,0.15288535
yet are you excited is that this is it bumblebee is an Aquaman later on,0.24240652
today you might just be getting a bumblebee movie review I believe that embargo is,0.064626604
going to drop while I'm watching the film I hope I can review it at,0.066450916
that point and then we have Aquaman and Mary Poppins later this month it's a,0.06265597
great month it's a great year for comic book movies and spider-man into the spider-verse,0.12150262
may just be the best we'll have to see when I do my top 10,0.06746626
