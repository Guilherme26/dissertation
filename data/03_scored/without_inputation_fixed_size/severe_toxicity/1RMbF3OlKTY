hello everybody today I'm going to be reviewing a moon light this is written and,0.045710754
directed by Barry Jenkins Jenkins actually based the film on a play that he had,0.030720176
seen that was called in moonlight black boys turned blue chickens was so struck by,0.01528725
the play and also the playwright himself both of them had very similar backgrounds they,0.005357389
both grew up in Miami and a lot of the situations really resonated with him,0.035328567
and the result is this magnificent very sensory poetic work that I think depicts the,0.0323093
minority experience it's so beautifully and so authentically I really do think that this film,0.08284729
has the kind of artistic presence that can resonate with anyone and everyone and I,0.056791384
think it really does have a certain kind of raw power I walked into this,0.038696393
movie knowing almost nothing about it really I all have seen it was a poster,0.023510916
and just a brief premise and I think the less you know about the film,0.028735934
the better in terms of when you're just going in to watch it but I,0.02943238
mean when I talk about the premise I'm sure you're probably going to roll your,0.04323627
eyes because it does have a lot of what may seem like cliches and things,0.07019217
that we've seen over and over and over again it is a coming-of-age story it,0.029876724
has that typical set up character set up and plot set up that does seem,0.021102287
very much like Oscar bait or something of that nature but it's presented in a,0.01734799
way that is so unique to the filmmaker and in a way that I don't,0.015722945
think we've ever seen before it's actually kind of similar to boyhood and Tree of,0.031155206
Life in a lot of ways maybe more similar to boyhood but it is in,0.02972107
the sense that it is about a young boy going from childhood to adulthood and,0.03347936
this particular film it's told in three parts and honestly each part could stand on,0.038428325
its own as some great kind of short film but when you add them all,0.030778712
together that's when it really has a lot of gravitas in this case the film,0.032077815
is about an african-american male named Sharon and he it's basically just about him trying,0.2210545
to find himself him struggling with his identity his sexuality the persona that maybe he,0.13238418
wants to wear for the rest of his life and all of this is happening,0.047577925
of course while life throws all kinds of different obstacles at him Sharon is a,0.110725805
very awkward very taciturn kind of boy always feeling like he does fitting like he,0.092234366
can't express himself and where you might think the film is starting to veer into,0.020771025
cliche territory it actually doesn't but it may seem like it because he does have,0.038643844
a drug-addicted mother he is taken under the wing of a drug dealer who becomes,0.40831867
kind of his father figure there is the school bully so when you see all,0.13891363
of that you may kind of have an eye roll or two but this film,0.10061967
even though it does employ those ideas and those concepts that were used to it,0.021396963
does it in a way that feels like it's very complex and like it all,0.040071994
is serving the layers of the story the main ensemble of characters is very well,0.01372806
defined I think and all of this is done with very minimal dialogue but we're,0.02312644
in cliches you might see the drug-addicted mother or the bully being kind of negative,0.38135085
stereotypes and film in this case I feel that they offer that complexity because each,0.023917343
time something happens to the character of shyrone it always models the waters it's never,0.028418642
good or bad it's kind of a mix of the two because everything in life,0.09621482
is messy and I feel like in certain scenes of the film for sure the,0.017846212
film is kind of saying that whatever beats you down whether it's figuratively or literally,0.04654556
in this case it can good can come out of it it can help you,0.048010293
evolve and make you stronger and help you navigate life maybe a little bit better,0.078558855
but at the same time when good things happen and good people come into your,0.077270396
life sometimes that can lead to negativity that can lead to betrayal or it can,0.036167365
hurt you in some sort of way so there are pros and cons to everything,0.35106525
where I make a connection with the Tree of Life is more in the visual,0.028926842
style of it because I think they're similarly abstract especially at the beginning of the,0.025493164
film in this movie you feel like through the the camerawork it's like you along,0.06606072
with shyuum are discovering the world the cinematography in the beginning feels very physical it,0.036410823
feels very disorienting and you know there are parts of it that are kind of,0.049659286
out of focus and that to me kind of reflects what it's like being a,0.03129556
child you know that that vigor that confusion and that need for self-discovery but as,0.025908237
the film goes along it starts to kind of settle into itself a little bit,0.049419153
more and become more kind of soft and subtle and it's as if Sharon has,0.025322212
finally learned how to deal with the world and how to make his way in,0.074154004
a way that keeps him semi in control he may not necessarily completely understand the,0.018731572
world but you know who does but he's learned how to kind of defend himself,0.028462542
and build these hard calluses and nothing in terms of the aesthetic of the film,0.048004974
feels gimmicky I mean when you look at the cinematography or the lighting all of,0.019483894
it feels completely authentic and essential to the moment because it's not trying to reflect,0.021440199
reality necessarily but rather it's trying to capture emotion and the score is also amazing,0.015123615
and I can't even remember the last time that I actually took note of a,0.022313586
score and mentioned it on a YouTube video because it's so rare in this day,0.043621413
and age but it's very simple and very pure because it's you know for the,0.01901494
most part it's it's kind of the main theme is a simple melody but I,0.042946253
love the kind of wispy airy feel to the strings because it seems almost like,0.055776313
in the beginning of the film at least it seems like a bird is kind,0.032135688
of just starting to learn how to fly it's it's fluttering its wings almost like,0.02393863
it's testing the waters and all of these different elements come together in what feels,0.021816693
like this symphony of artistry basically in depicting an unlikely protagonist because first of all,0.03835715
we rarely see an african-american at the forefront of the film so that in itself,0.1255308
is wonderful to see but it's also just the fact that he isn't used in,0.023444397
a stereo to go away but what really resonated with me and I think what's,0.08704061
going to resonate with most people is the way that you see this character evolution,0.04650565
that his need for human connection and love vulnerability is so achingly present yet society,0.13135049
slowly chips away at that that beauty that innocence that we have when were children,0.11267812
until it's almost lost but it but it's not it's always there like in Sharon's,0.03883475
case in the case of so many men I mean when he's a young boy,0.21252617
he's taught to be this kind of masculine idealized man taught to walk it up,0.092231706
not to show emotion and that's just not who he is he's seen this week,0.03490751
because he wants to cry when everybody else says that that's not a good thing,0.06842013
and he also wants to express himself sexually in a lot of ways or at,0.266462
least he has sexual confliction for sure but in the society in which he lives,0.42407113
he just doesn't know how to do that in part one of the film there's,0.026882067
a line by one of the characters where he tells shy room that you have,0.015408314
basically I don't remember exactly what the line is but you have to decide for,0.0068181325
yourself who you want to be no one else can decide that for you and,0.055417113
that's a line that in movies and in life you do hear a lot but,0.025961453
I think that the film itself is trying to say that no you don't just,0.019332232
decide who you want to be we are so heavily influenced by our surroundings by,0.017616058
the people in our world we often become what we know whether we want to,0.08353709
or not and yet when we become adults we start to kind of find that,0.031343453
truth than you think steer and we start to want to strip away all of,0.45310375
that kind of hardened those hardened calluses that we've built up as children because that's,0.13678837
who we are inherently and I think that's what shyrone tries to do especially in,0.063238345
the third part of the film there's a quote by Roger Ebert that I know,0.015839353
I've mentioned several times I I definitely overuse it but I think that it fits,0.027955009
this film so perfectly and I kept thinking about it I was as I was,0.053798057
watching the movie and he said something along the lines of art is the only,0.031079376
way in which you can really truly understand what a stranger really feels and I,0.041351806
think that that just makes so much sense in the context of this film so,0.022716686
even if you work on Wall Street and make six figures a year or something,0.021137541
you can watch this movie and completely understand this young african-american man because you too,0.31098634
have become a product of your society and yet also like shyrone we you have,0.11010852
that need to be vulnerable and to be true to yourself despite all of those,0.08645857
layers that you've built over the years every once in a while a movie comes,0.02640247
around that really does move me in a way that I can't stop thinking about,0.037576888
it and I feel like in a way it just it really dug deep and,0.04482473
I it's much more than I feel most things boyhood was one of those and,0.03018936
Tree of Life was one of those and this film did just that I think,0.023533532
everybody has to see it it is just a masterful creation and that is my,0.040954027
