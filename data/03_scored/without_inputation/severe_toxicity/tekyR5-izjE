[Applause] hey guys I've got a new review for you and this one is for,0.028280282
a pretty major awards contender this year Greta Gerwig solo feature directorial debut ladybird stars,0.029969184
Saoirse Ronan as Christine who now goes by the name ladybird she is finishing up,0.090257436
high school at a Catholic school in Sacramento and she is really eager to get,0.044009216
out of town and into college all the way on the East Coast far far,0.03520285
away from home the movie isn't based on girl wigs life but she has said,0.07769678
that the movie does contain certain ideas that have truth to her and you can,0.022948835
really feel it while you're watching the movie it works especially well with the way,0.044826727
that Lady Bird looks at Sacramento I personally didn't experience exactly this when choosing where,0.04388882
to go to college but I do very much understand and connect to the thought,0.020120475
that something special is out there and it's somewhere that you're not and that intense,0.056822646
pulling you might have towards it I did have that feeling a little while moving,0.049321372
to LA and girl work really captures that idea and feeling so beautifully in a,0.04845397
way that both well represents ladybirds current disdain for her hometown but also while conveying,0.07112143
what makes it a special place and that's a balance that's really important throughout the,0.017902087
entire film and then of course there's Saoirse Ronan performance and she is just something,0.04277264
else from Hanna to Brooklyn to this and so much more her range is incredible,0.015776826
and so is her ability to wholly become a character by the end of this,0.03904628
Lady Bird truly felt like a person I knew and I enjoyed getting to know,0.104383275
and that speaks to both how well-rounded the character is and also how well Gerwig,0.0171338
establishes the highs and lows of growing up how one moment one thing can seem,0.026290718
like the most important thing in the world but next it's not but then also,0.03392237
how all of that is deeply connected when it comes to who you become there,0.010880409
are so many key moments for Lady Bird in this movie and some do get,0.034614827
more screen time than others but all of them resonate and really mean something personal,0.044140257
favorites though include her relationship with Lucas hedges character Danny someone she falls for while,0.027537273
doing a play and also with beanie Feldstein who plays Julie her best friend but,0.022853715
while I might have liked those connections most the portions of the film that focus,0.016527154
on Timothy shall amaze eyal another guy who catches ladybirds eye and the queen bee,0.16792029
of the popular crowd Jenna played by O'Day Arush they're just as important because ultimately,0.018788777
you're a product of all your experiences and relationships and that's something that Lady Bird,0.08229386
highlights especially well but where it finds even more success with that concept though is,0.009382416
through ladybirds relationship with her mother played by Laurie Metcalf Gerwig penned the script here,0.17587589
as well and she nails the mother-daughter dynamic Metcalf and Ronan are so flawless in,0.1872053
their heated back and forth and also when they get those abrupt shifts of getting,0.0371239
over one issue and moving on to something else they disagree a good deal in,0.023643287
the movie but the love is always there kind of like it's always underneath the,0.040093943
surface and it gets to shine through every now and then but no matter what,0.054059476
you always feel it Metcalfe and Ronan really are fantastic but I also have to,0.05636101
mention Tracy Letts as ladybirds father they have a really beautiful connection that winds up,0.06752811
serving is a really effective assist to what's going on between Lady Bird and her,0.06948309
mother I'm gonna give ladybird four and a half Dewey's out of five on the,0.17198655
Dewey Decimal scale this is just a really special one and perhaps it's extra special,0.040308133
to me as someone who finds some similarities and ladybirds experience and also deeply values,0.05399096
my relationship with my mother but now that I've seen it I also do understand,0.095068716
why there's such widespread love for this movie it's fun touching a great mix of,0.07413937
comedy heart and nostalgia ladybirds journey is delightful and deeply moving for her and in,0.042952903
the end it also challenges you to consider who you've become and why and the,0.016231146
first thought I had walking out of the theater is just how grateful I was,0.032552756
that I got to experience this movie with my mom so there's my review of,0.101212345
Lady Bird but now I want to know your thoughts did you see it did,0.076796785
