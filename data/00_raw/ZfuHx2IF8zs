have you ever like gone back to like think about how you were like when you were younger you know you know especially pertain to like where you were in eighth grade like you know in I was in eighth grade all of us have Facebook I can't even bother looking at the things I was saying or the pictures I took some comfortable like damn like we were really some awkward people I know I was awkward I Jesus it makes me cringe just thinking about how I was back in the day eighth grade sees the direct oh they be a boat boring them sorry Ashley Fisher's Josh Hamilton and tells the story of this little girl played by Ashley Fitch Fisher and she's dealing with things that kids go through when I wander in eighth grade it takes place around the last week of her being eighth grade and this movies beautiful I I mean I heard good things about it coming out of Sundance but I could not tell you how great this movie is like for example like you know like there's things that you go through when you're 13 and there's like the highs and the lows like there's things that Kayla the main character of this movie that she goes through that are exciting and you know then there's some lows and it's it's so great how Bo Burnham is I don't know how he does it but he's able to make you feel glad and really happy and then also like make you feel like crap and also feel empathetic and just and it's almost like an allegory s like what life is you know everybody thinks that life is kind of like this amazing thing you know at the or it's bad like the life will never be perfect there will always be a gray area somewhere and I think it was done so massively well and one the Elsie Fisher oh my goodness she's a school like she did so well in this movie like for like I really thought like that was Kayla I really thought that was a real person like she did so well in this movie Josh Hamilton is also great as her father there's also a little side kids that you get with you know kids her age that he has to kind of deal with that like if it felt so real like it's I don't even know how he was able to get all these character performances out all these people and burn them speaking about burning um this guy's crazy like this script I like right now right now is she getting on there for Best Screenplay like easy and it's not even close it's the screenplay so it makes the dialogue is great the character beets are so great the character moments are so true and so genuine like it doesn't make any sense like how one person could actually make a movie so realistic like I know I say move their movies that just feel real like call me by your name this one felt so real bo burnham the way he's able to use the camera to kind of like um show you like you kind of see things kind of like do an audience perspective like we almost look like we're looking down as to what's going on and then we also have also have shots where we see from the perspective of Kayla's character like we'll see Kayla like talking and nobody it will show something else and then they'll eventually like pan towards her but what else what is showing before we get to Kayla is awesome also matters because she may be talking about something else that it just aren't even explaining you just need to watch it there's great moments just with Kayla where she does these YouTube videos and you know these evils are kind of for advice but she herself doesn't follow her own advice or just I don't like it just it's crazy how relatable it is at least to me because like I I wouldn't want to be a complete different person and now I was on this end up so right now but especially when I was younger and this movie definitely captures that feeling of Kayla she wants to be as confident person she wants be this great extroverts button person she's an introvert like she just want to talk to anybody she was uncomfortable just being around people and like I I almost like teared up like how relatable this film and like there's a scene that just happens that it's like literally like the whole theater was on the same page and this movie was so great everybody was on the same page like we like every time we're supposed to feel this emotions the whole theater felt the emotions and even when people like maybe there's a moment that felt uncomfortable you hear people laughing like a little bit because they are so it's so uncomfortable it's like like they're trying to find a different vice has to deal with it like there was a moment there's a moment that happens and like me and I was with somebody and we like we were holding onto each other like yo like this is like getting intense out to the person next to me was so complete random we're looking at each other and we're both on the same page to like this was just like the whole theater was just in sync and I'm not even talking about know Justin [ __ ] I'm sorry I take it back Kayla and their dad also have this really really interesting relationship that's just it's great and it's really human and it the way it resolves and now I just it was it's just great I I'm just a loss of words yeah there's no but there's no boat with this movie this movie is actually just over 90 minutes - it's perfectly short all in all vote Bernie this is a great debut man writing directing else efficient Jesus you are great Josh Hamilton you are great all the stockades acts in this movie that pop up they have to deal with Kayla's life throughout this week you are great cinematography is great oh there's also like there's actually not really a score in this movie it's really kind of just songs but mostly beats that fit almost as a score I'm really surprised as to how much I love this movie and I hated that there's about to be three of these already I'm going to give a grade A ten crazy how last year it took me until July Dunkirk and war flowing of the Apes for me to get my first ten in the whole year I've had three already and I don't want to see like I have a 24 bias also you know the other signs are ready Terry but they look a 24 I love you guys so you guys just make great movies um I'll see you guys later I'm actually like in a few minutes in like 20 minutes I'm not to go drive over to go see Mission Impossible I'm gonna edit this wildlife along I'm sitting there waiting for the movie to start I'll see you guys later I'll
