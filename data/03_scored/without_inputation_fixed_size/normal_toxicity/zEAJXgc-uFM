hi welcome to Reza views today i'm gonna be reviewing thor ragnarok this is the,0.11054537
third thor film and the 17th installment in the MCU so by now you should,0.0682794
know they're not you're into these movies there's been a lot of hype surrounding this,0.10783849
film especially because its promotional materials seem to show that they're taking a completely different,0.0615573
direction and a new tone when it comes to the Thor movies which was a,0.044312514
welcome change for me because I felt that the previous Thor movie stuck themselves a,0.055339787
little bit too seriously this was directed by Taika Waititi who's not a very well,0.31089434
known director he's directed a small film called what we do in the shadow which,0.08550108
is a hilarious mockumentary that I definitely recommend and I'm a big fan of so,0.15331627
I'm very happy to see such a small-time director get his big shot and do,0.43605173
a big Marvel film and I was looking forward to seeing what he's gonna do,0.18823814
with it and I think seen the film my first impression of it is that,0.030785022
it was fun with a capital S I generally liked Thor Ragnarok a lot and,0.113488644
I definitely enjoyed it but it has its ups and down so I'm gonna dive,0.2131379
in now and start talking about the ups the top three things that I liked,0.06407449
about thor ragnarok number three the visual style I really liked how this film looked,0.0850727
and felt this movie is extremely colorful and it felt like it had this 80s,0.07753453
cam to it which was really enjoyable editing in the soundtrack together make up for,0.08909891
this amazing visual extravaganza that you completely enjoy especially when it comes to the fighting,0.14612728
season this movie has awesome fighting cease really cool stuff the costume design is also,0.10989475
very cool so it gets his helmet finally we get to see that and it,0.06836257
looks pretty badass and the number one outfit in the whole thing for me was,0.21730047
Hellas costume it's so cool I cannot wait turn that into a cosplay the look,0.2422274
and feel of this film takes a huge departure from the first and second Thor,0.067833796
movies it looks more like guardians of the galaxy than anything else in them see,0.09343847
you and it really helps make you feel like you are somewhere out of this,0.20248565
earth because come on our real world it's kind of boring when you compare it,0.31089434
to the extravaganza of the cosmos the number two thing I liked about Thor Ragnarok,0.06992585
was Valkyrie introducing a new character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is not easy because,0.09374211
there's so many of them so it's very hard for a new character to make,0.07162232
an impact however Valkyrie played brilliantly by Tessa Thompson is an exception to the rule,0.078006454
she's funny she's cool she's but uh she's a great fighter she had really nice,0.15131706
chemistry with Thor and everybody else and with the Hulk I really liked her and,0.05522678
I can't wait to see more the number one thing I liked but Thor Ragnarok,0.081831306
was expanding the MCU similarly to guardians of the galaxy and also Doctor Strange this,0.065806426
movie expands the world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a very nice way where,0.14606594
it takes it outside of the human world and the human first world's problems and,0.44758525
ties us into what's coming which is infinity war turned out sweet in the previous,0.14261238
floor films especially the second one Thor seem to always be compelled to come back,0.07968727
to earth and interact with humans for some reason it's like we can't enjoy the,0.14666618
floor unless he was with other human characters but this time he's completely free from,0.07864085
those shackles and he's out there in the universe interacting with crazy things and crazy,0.4323124
characters and things that are as over-the-top and ask powerful as he is and also,0.056573797
this movie expanded the universe in terms of the mythos and it felt like it,0.079794005
was very Nordic in nature we really felt like the mystical world of the Vikings,0.14811349
and their gods and their mythology really come through in this film more than any,0.084275156
of the other films I didn't enjoy everything about Thor Ragnarok so here are the,0.098805785
top three things I didn't like about the movie number three not all the characters,0.06952284
work through I really like Thor holic and as I mentioned Valkyrie and a lot,0.09300324
of other characters that were in this film but there are two characters that didn't,0.028961744
work for me at all and one of them is Jeff Goldblum as Grand Master,0.084837936
an apologist Oh Jeff Goldblum fans out there but I haven't really enjoyed most of,0.11197918
his recent performances because they all really feel like they are the same thing and,0.059620447
in this movie it was no exception I always felt like whenever the Grand Master,0.065168746
was on screen that oh look I'm watching Jeff go boom it's a movie it,0.10697681
really took me out of the film and disconnected me from it completely which I,0.08617286
never liked another character that didn't work for me is Keith Urban's skirt who I,0.14677721
felt was kind of pointless I didn't really buy into his story I didn't really,0.1675521
care about him and I felt like he was kind of a waste of time,0.4851063
and now let's see even the performance wasn't that great he felt like he was,0.09500255
just there to be there I really liked Ella as a character and as a,0.062335353
villain in this movie however I felt like her character was a little bit mishandled,0.31588498
in the sense that her scenes seem to clash so much with general tone of,0.18306907
the film and also we didn't spend enough time with her she was mostly there,0.062170405
to be a mock piece for certain exposition and explaining her backstory to us when,0.28179163
I thought that her backstory was so compelling I wish I actually saw it so,0.13392985
as a character and as a concept was pretty cool and as a performance catcher,0.0642123
did an amazing job and she looked good in this movie I mean geez look,0.124157794
at that woman she looks incredible however towards the end of the film I felt,0.31089434
her role was not as expansive as I wanted it to be and I felt,0.35408846
like it was cut a little too short and I didn't also feel like she,0.15353823
meshed well with the rest of the film speaking of the tone the second thing,0.080059305
I didn't like about thor ragnarok was the extreme tone change like I said earlier,0.09989094
I am a fan of the change of the tone from the other Thor films,0.07430004
but this film felt like it went a little bit too far change and experimenting,0.11162827
is a good thing and I like seeing a fresh take on a character or,0.034682028
on a franchise however this film completely disconnected from the first and a second Thor,0.043909926
so I feel like there is such a thing as too much fun or too,0.059882555
funny I didn't recognize Thor's character in this movie he's so different from all of,0.07247937
the other films sometimes in a good way but sometimes it's felt like I went,0.07758478
a little too far and the same applies to Hulk as well which leads me,0.07587775
to the number one thing I didn't like about thor ragnarok which is the fact,0.06987817
that the stakes were not high due to the overtly comical fun times thing that,0.08425386
the movie was doing I never felt like any of the characters were in any,0.090246096
real danger and no stakes are never a good thing for a movie especially if,0.10448348
it's action-packed because those action scenes lose their intensity if you don't think anybody's gonna,0.10202246
get really hurt and the reason why I thought that's because everything was a joke,0.11960305
even intense emotional scenes were overshadowed by jokes and people not taking things seriously I,0.15598057
mean if the characters don't take the situation seriously I'm not gonna take the situation,0.06333841
seriously and I feel like this is gonna bother the comic book readers more than,0.068729796
most people but when you say Ragnarok Ragnarok is the end of days it's a,0.091358036
disaster of epic proportions and that kind of Armageddon feel never really translated well it's,0.18070719
like oh my god the most horrible thing is about to happen oh my god,0.31262264
this also girls would be a little bit emotionally disconnected from the movie and from,0.2435194
the characters and also didn't leave me with anything to contemplate or think about in,0.06598807
terms of themes in terms of character moments and character arcs it's just felt a,0.018661615
little too shallow which means I don't think this movie is going to leave a,0.11339821
lasting impression but only time will tell if I'm right or wrong oh I had,0.07322402
a good time watching this movie it's definitely my favorite Thor movie but it's not,0.047045503
my favorite MCU movie but if you've liked the MCU films so far and you'll,0.11115743
definitely enjoy this one as well it's a solid fun Marvel movie and I'm gonna,0.23883615
give Thor Ragnarok and eight out of ten so have you seen Thor did you,0.15393332
