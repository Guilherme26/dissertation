so the modern horror genre actually kicked off with medical living-dead which featured a black lead but then the genre quickly switched to white female leads so I find it absolutely fascinating that Jordan Peele has taken inspiration from some of those female centric horror films that comment on misogyny I mean I guess in some degree they all kind of comment on misogyny but still you know Rosemary's Baby The Stepford Wives they took it to the next level and Peele has said that those were direct inspirations for making get out so he built on those took the horror genre full circle with a commentary on race relations it's pretty impressive like like is the thesis statement you're just blown away as that you can see where all the critics all the media rocking a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes it was really well positioned to go into the weekend but like many thesis statements while it's easy to wow well not easy but it's easier to Wow right out of the gate it's harder to bring it on home you know that pesky third act and I think that's what really trips peel up I think that it's weak and doesn't work and holds back the film from being a classic on the level of Rosemary's Baby or Stepford Wives but still overall very positive development for the horror genre how different ethnicities are represented in film and everyone involved with this production so on that note oh we just said that I am absolutely thrilled for peel and its cast their talent is being recognized not just by you know black audiences but this movie has crossover appeal my theatre when I went on Saturday night I was traveling in Los Angeles for the Oscars Dolby flew me out there to go behind the scenes that's why I'm late reviewing this but my theatre was 5050 in terms of the demographics that attended and that's reflected actually in polling for the film it was it because you're taking also Asian viewers and Latino viewers in to account it was about like mid-30s for both african-american and Caucasian audiences so that's spectacular especially because you're talking about a film with a black unknown lead you know it's not Denzel it's not Will Smith and also a first-time director in the genre who also happens to be black to have that kind of crossover appeal it's been very difficult in Hollywood to achieve that so that right there you know is something that Peele can be proud of and he has definitely has something to say I think the intellectual approach helped him and you also clearly loves the genre but everybody was listening and that's just so spectacular and I think that well again this won't become a horror classic and we'll discuss the ending at the end of this review in the spoiler section but I think this will serve as a launchpad particularly for Peale and his star Daniel kuya I want to make sure I pronounce his name correctly now I want to start off with Pele as a director he's been stuck in Keith's shadow for quite some time I felt bad for him but I do think the key is the superior on-camera talent there's just there's an energy there but the seat pealed breakout a Keith shadow by going behind the camera I think it just shows you how important is to be able to think outside the box and a willingness to adjust your dream you know I still in the same industry still doing what he loves and he has now had a resounding success and I think that while he lets himself as a rope down as a writer at the end of the movie and quite frankly if he had a better producer sorry Jason Blum the producer would have you know pointed this out to him and it's amazing fix the end would have been a very easy fix which makes it all the more frustrating but his skills as a director are very impressive from the very first scene this camerawork to his use of music to his ability to make a movie that was made for under five million dollars look like it was made for six time that six times that proves the appeal is a very talented director he also makes some really unique creative choices throughout the film which elevate it and I would say he's the most ambitious director that Jason Blum has discovered you know a new director since James Wan and Scott Derrickson and that's not bad company to be it I'd be very curious to see what Pele does next when you know what his next gig is if he stays in his own lane or if he swallowed up by a franchise also to be fair key & peele sketches role is very ambitious ly directed so even more kudos to peel for obviously paying attention and learning on the job I would also say the peel is up there with Kenya bears from blackish on ABC as a voice that presents black characters as fully three-dimensional characters and not stereotypes caricatures or having the burden of representing their entire community also credit belongs to Daniel Kuya the star of the film who gives a wonderfully understated performance and you know with an American accent no less he's from the UK he got his big start on Black Mirror over there that show came here to Netflix but you know some of his best moments came with just a look he's a really talented actor I think his body language is excellent and just even just what he can say with his eyes speaking of that Pele does do some good writing with the tragic backstory to begin Scalia's character and I thought that kahl√∫a did a fabulous job bringing that guilt and grief to life you know like Pele set him up but kouya knocked it out of the park I also want to give a shout out specifically to Betty Gabriel she said she stood out to me in the purge election year last year but to see her here playing such a different character shows what amazing range she has and I hope she gets more work as well the whole film is very well cast though and no often they say good directing a lot of it is just good casting right like if you know and that's you know people talk about us Tarantino right like if you can't if you cast well 90% of your work is done and Pele I think this is an excellent example of that for instance he did a very good job using the personas that Allison Williams and Catherine Keener have already established through their other work and that was that made both of them very effective here I also thought you know there was some comedic relief from the best friend although here the best friend and the lead both happened to be played by black actors and that's very progressive in Hall unfortunately but larell Howry was the funny best friend and he did a great job I also he was huge just enough you know to lighten the mood just when it was needed but not too cheap in the film and also that dog quite a ball now for the ending so we're going into spoiler territory so this is a warning and if you're going to bail out here if you haven't seen the movie and I would like just to say that get out is worth seeing now should you see it in the theater while if you're a horror fan or a cinephile or you're interested in the evolution of how different ethnicities are portrayed in Hollywood or you just like to be part of big events in this film has definitely become like a moment in pop culture and you should totally see it in the theater but if none of those things matter to you then you can wait to stream it all right so last warning we're going to talk about the ending okay alright so as I said the ending was weak and could have been easily fixed so a good twist is one where once you know it you can look back at the earlier part of the film and see the clues just ask em nice Xiaolan which is you know career-defining twist the sixth sense and interestingly enough he's also been working with jason blum recently but when you saw this when you'll learn the twist in the sixth sense and you look back at the rest of the movie suddenly saw things with new perspectives they made sense etc but here when it was revealed that Walter and Georgina were actually the armitage grandparents you couldn't look back at the earlier part of the movie and be like oh yeah that's who they were acting like grandparents they were the servants of the house the whole time or they were like not there that was awful weird like as grandpa Armitage was the leader of this entire movement why would he be satisfied going from that to this chopping wood and you know you know not really being a part of his family anymore right they had a late night running which I guess was kind of a nod to his racing past and I thought that was interesting that he was beaten out by Jesse Owens to go to the Olympics and that started this whole train of thought but what was he racing for to what end you know the people who underwent this procedure never left the community they never did anything with their new bodies so I don't understand the selling point of oh we're going to take a white brain and put it in a black body and the thinking here from this evil group was that both were the superior the white mine in the black body and create an ultimate individual but I've never saw a shred of the original person inside there like you saw the the the tragic black soul you know struggling to get out but I never saw the white person that had been inserted in there I never saw that person you know it was always just like some unreal zombie like mode that they went into I didn't I would have been much more interesting like for instance that guy was kidnapped at the beginning of the movie and when he showed up at the party he I've had quirks and interests and genuinely acted like the guy you know that woman's original husband but no it was just he was like a zombie and so I can't look back at any mom in the movie and be like I see it in a whole new light you know instead I go well now it doesn't make sense now you cut them well what about Walters comments about Rose when he says all she's such an attractive young woman to me I felt and still feel that that was attributable to his black man's romances rose but he still you know I mean obviously if you could see from in the movie that was a great moment when he shot her but you know there you know I think maybe he you know I thought maybe he was saying it like what it was spite like she was so beautiful and she lured me to my doom and I did like that twist I did like that Rose was a honey trap and I thought it was very funny when she was looking up top and c-double-a candidates at the end of the movie although again why bother you know if they weren't going to do anything with these bodies it made no sense you know the whole superior genetic argument like oh you'd be a great fighter you know if the brother was saying to Daniel who use character at the dinner table but they never did anything like that so you I would think they would just be getting younger bodies you know who cares about the ethnicity look for people who wouldn't be missed and that would make more sense to me in this in the way it was set up by you know Pele and since it's his script he could set it up any way he wants so if PL effects this problem and then you could see that the souls of the people who've taken over the bodies as well I think this would be a horror classic that would last you know stand the test of time but instead it's not going to however he was so close to a horror classic I'm confident that appeal will get there very soon and we'll be seeing a lot more of Kuya and you know maybe it'll even give a boost to some of the other people involved in the film I hope Buddy Gabriel but maybe even Allison Williams might see some some reward for this as well so what do you think what do you think of the whole movie what did you think of a twist what do you think of the twist now that I've brought up my problems with it and what do you think of Peele going forward and also what he's done for the horror genre and his commentary as well I thought clearly a very intelligent film it just didn't stick the landing
