it to his friend Barton he stole needs to make amends for what he feels a bit real and has a half Barbara Stanwyck is greatest fella says women who as emotionally avoid it seems who is there only to use things to use people and she knows it,0.32187888
and that's what she does throughout the movie twists and turns every situation you get an excellently set up Martha,0.06956955
the Hitchcock would have been proud of the way they kind of play out and it really does add the suspense and tension to the movie all the way through that doesn't seem to be a waste it,0.16392012
seemed there doesn't seem to be a moment the stalls anything everything is there to add pressure or excitement or terror or danger to each situation whether it be variable or with an actions is there to create a mood and a sensibility and that is the best thing about Double Indemnity,0.11890652
and just bowels consistently unquestionably through actor even though you knew was coming from that opening,0.060841005
