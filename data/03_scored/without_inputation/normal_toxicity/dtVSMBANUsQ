what is up guys,0.09388932
we are back talking a brand new movie called the shape of water,0.063912295
this is one of my most anticipated movies for the award season due to the fact that this movie is directed by del Toro,0.062236216
this is one my favorite visionary directors from pat slam Brent to Hellboy to crimson peak,0.27002683
I actually did enjoy pick a crimson peak,0.09347842
I thought it was different and shaved water here is different,0.050685864
and I would like to say that I think this is del Toro is best film to date,0.08368195
I think every single film the guys directed beforehand has led up to this moment,0.11332379
and he's taking every strength and skill from those films and pushed it into this movie,0.13080956
and then any cons are negatives,0.06371338
he's had those other films,0.19881034
he's whisked away and put into this brand new fairy tale that del Toro's dreamed up and it really is just immaculate how creative this film is,0.15083209
but also how beautiful the movie is itself that was a lot of love because this film every single minute of this film made me fall more in love with it from the characters written and performed,0.09914729
by the actors in here or even from the mythology brought into here with the fairytale aspect of this fish creature that we see because I find this film to be a kind of a reference to Creature from the Black Lagoon mixed it with a different type of fairy tale,0.08378906
that's oddly gruesome and weird at the same time,0.28069612
but that's what del Toro does best,0.090283446
and I think that's what this film does amazingly well and the fact that creature from Black Lagoon is probably my favorite horror monster it,0.41457042
this kind of gave me a little bit more love for this character it's fish creature played by Doug Jones who if you guys,0.11849197
don't know Doug Jones's look him up,0.121276915
the guy is a really good actor and I don't think he gets enough credit where it's due and him playing this fish creature who really just has no dialogue he you believe in the emotion he hits in them you believe in the character development that goes with this fish creature,0.18790208
and it's so greatly looked at I mean I have to really praise editorial I mean that's was really more about prosthetics and makeup and stuff but the process is to makeup really work on this character and I'm curious to see how much CGI was actually used for the character because the makeup it looks so realistic like I would have believed that this thing is something real that they found out that they found in the real world,0.08447314
I loved the look of the character he film really works because of Sally Hawkins performance in here in Richard Jenkins performance because Sally Hawkins plays a mute girl in here who really just works this facility this government facility with Octavia Spencer who offed a via Spencer is also fantastic in here giving a lot of the great comedic elements to this movie day this film is weirdly oddly which it is a weird oddly movie but it also has weird oddly humor placed into it which you would think all does not ruin the theme of the film and the pacing no it actually enhances it which was weird because like I said this is del Toro it has those weird kooky vibes to it,0.15194365
but it works for this dramatic undertone for the film because of course this film is overall a fairy tale,0.1015688
it's a weird gruesome fairy tale but it works but going back to the performances Sally Hawkins I think this might be my second or third favorite performance maybe it's tied up there with number one,0.15472324
I don't know she is so good in here,0.18976226
and there's one scene in pretty with her character that I don't want to get into,0.15248741
but the way this scene was shot the way she performed in that scene and the way del Toro had the camera whisking around in the scene was amazing,0.35992572
it's something that hasn't been in the trailer,0.06753053
it's something that really is an old throwback to older films the scene that is so different from this year in genre that it really I think for some people could pull them out of the movie but for me and enhance the role and enhance that moment in the movie and I really fell in love with that scene I don't want to get in the spoiler,0.096330196
so I'm just gonna say that I think if you've seen the movie you probably know what I'm talking about it's towards the later half of the film cores,0.08142143
Michael Shannon is also in the film and I mean Michael Shannon's great when this is they do not a good actor he gives a good performance in here not one of his best,0.10088481
I would say I don't think it's reward worthy,0.12798832
but I think really Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins are fantastic in here Richard Jenkins again one of the actors in here who brings a lot of Lebanese character developments to him and I love where his character ends up going,0.06675981
and I think he's just a great friend to the character of Sally Hawkins,0.03812978
I don't think I've even talked about how this film was shocked the cinematography for the so I thought Blade Runner was the most beautiful film of this year,0.0632747
but I think this is like right under that film,0.097801305
I think this film is beautifully shot,0.24871598
I think del Toro is way of using the camera and moving it around especially with the underwater scenes,0.089531645
per se or even even the other amazing beautiful imagery,0.09343474
you see in this film this film is just beautiful,0.07220123
it's like a portrait and I love saying that because this is what this film really feels like it feels like paintings and drawings thrown onto the big screen and I really just every second of this film made me fall more and more in love with this film from the kooky weird themes of the film to the great fairy tale aspect as well that totally meshed together well because it's Del Toro's movie you totally know this is a del Toro movie from acting from the actors and actresses in here being phenomenal from the creature really working not feeling cheesy but really you can believe in this relationship between all the characters in this creature from everything just working in general from that aspect humor really not giving away,0.14728676
the undertone of the drama of the scenes and that humor actually really enhancing the movie the CGI is a beautiful the film's shot amazingly and I think I have to talk about the score III think my favorite score from this year is probably this one it's right up there with Blade,0.076180324
Runner,0.03939025
but these two are my pawn my favorite scores from this year and I absolutely adored the score in this film it really just goes back to the old classic movies they kind of remind me of a little bit of Fallout as well but I love the score of this movie and I just fell in love with the score,0.104198046
I think the scores will really make me fall in love with the film,0.0998597
and just again the word is enhanced,0.073177144
every aspect of this some enhanced more and more of a reason to why you should love this film and del Toro overall,0.1325688
he's made a near masterpiece,0.13446029
here,0.05344117
I think like again,0.050195705
I said I think this is my favorite,0.06481647
del Toro film,0.038112387
I think it's his best well-made film I will say I have one con to the film and that con is I felt like the movies pacing at times was slow,0.08079077
it was a little slow at times and to build up and then sometimes it would ramp it really fast,0.099301435
and that was the one thing that I don't think enhanced her meshed with the film at all,0.12180837
but that's really just a small con in the way of such an amazing film,0.142488
I can't wait to see the shape of water,0.092666544
again,0.048684232

did bother me especially more on thinking because when I walk I was like you know on a a,0.13234201
plus I loved it then the more I thought about,0.05558773
it I was like you know that pacing really did kind of bother me at,0.10076734
