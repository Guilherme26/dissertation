what's going on ladies and gentlemen my name is Luke Ennis it's time for another,0.09425683
horror movie review and this one is extra special because this one is actually a,0.15545075
review of something that was sent to me off of my Amazon wishlist by a,0.07816906
very very kind person by the name of Terry fernback otherwise known as mr. T,0.1804172
from Germany he if you go to my link in the description you will find,0.10369844
the podcast we do together called iron cast with our third co-host check out some,0.09629804
episodes of that it's really cool and he very kindly sent me this to read,0.17637612
today well ordered me this sur review today rather the cabinet of dr. Caligari from,0.06287943
1920 so the movie was directed by Robert vine or Wayne I'm not really sure,0.054343455
how you pronounce the surname Andy Stiles werner krauss and Conrad vane again not sure,0.10061578
I'm pronouncing those names exactly right but you know I don't speak German so tensioning,0.27906513
the film is the flashback of a man named Francis describing to a friend the,0.06411027
terrible encounter that ruined the life of him and his fiancee the film essentially goes,0.1937124
on in the flashback to tell the story of dr. Caligari a hypnotist to present,0.110910356
to the world his s'en ambulance it's very difficult Cesare and he is living unconsciously,0.26653185
so to speak and this is quite the spectacle for those who encounter him a,0.059691098
string of murders happen across the town where the story takes place and people begin,0.31089434
to suspect dr. Caligari and and Caesar of being the perpetrators of these crimes this,0.13441369
is the oldest movie on ever likely to review and because there really aren't that,0.048362844
many horror movies before in many ways it's the birth of the horror film as,0.15500908
a feature as we know it you know I mean my sort specialist area when,0.11080358
it comes to horror is the seventies and eighties I mean I that's the area,0.12014686
that I'm most interested in spend most of my time with but that doesn't mean,0.04050003
that something like this isn't interesting and who's going to be playing art critic a,0.076982155
little bit on this one because you know all there really is to discuss here,0.110919766
is the visuals I guess you know as much as the story is interesting yeah,0.04757606
this is very much a visual masterpiece more than anything else all of the I,0.10151255
guess in a title cards have a really beautiful art style that's not something I,0.1533087
thought I've mentioned in a film review but they're all very they've all got a,0.05533144
great kind of Art Deco feel to them it's very it's very cool to see,0.08442783
those you know the shapes that scatter the back of the cards and you know,0.09172206
the fonts and stuff you know you mostly you know kind of associate in a,0.08128763
title cards from silent films has been you know just these things that flash up,0.07010201
on the screen but here there you are a bit of a feature in and,0.13694134
of themselves and I mean the set design of the movie is just fantastic it's,0.09579496
absolutely brilliant you know these all these sort of jaggedy buildings with these you know,0.24875416
interesting times I mean obviously almost every movie made at this time was shot on,0.20733863
sets you know there was no location shooting really at this time so you know,0.187719
there was there was an element of that in most great films at the time,0.106358334
but this movie takes it a step further it's like a Picasso painting come to,0.1019251
life you know all these weirdly shaped buildings and these winding alleyways I guess that,0.20047103
all ties in to the fact that it's a flashback you know and this movie,0.10036842
makes you aware that you're here in Reno an interpretation of an event and kind,0.060125105
of a dream I guess in a way that doesn't necessarily portray reality you know,0.0662358
as you get on towards the ending of the film you begin to realize that,0.0794499
actually this is an unreliable narrator you're listening to and so details like that can,0.15018763
be very you know you can't necessarily trust everything you see in the film if,0.053266816
you want to put it like that I mean speaking of that ending you know,0.25733596
for a movie made almost 100 years ago now it's a pretty kind twisted ending,0.15207282
actually you know that you know I'm not going to spoil it obviously putting it,0.1508731
out there that that ending is really quite off the chain quite unsettling and you,0.08490934
know the way that it it comes together you know like I say I think,0.087692365
this is a movie that you know is kind of the birth of horror in,0.22083168
a way you know I can imagine this movie being incredibly shocking at this time,0.16071996
you know given that I guess you know most most of filmmaking at this time,0.066469155
had to be a bit nicey-nicey you know to get something like this was what,0.23641396
would have been very new and quite revolutionary really since its you know a review,0.11218095
off of the wish list I want to talk a little bit about this actual,0.10849315
package itself this is the two-disc limited edition from Eureka entertainment it includes the is,0.055205833
part of their masters of cinema series includes the documentary from Calgary to Hitler it,0.153129
also includes a few other funny little bits like am you know there's an audio,0.18681142
commentary and all of that sort of thing in terms of special features on really,0.050519217
think that this should have more on it you know given the amount of money,0.09610367
this costs I know you do pay a little bit more for steel books anyway,0.22996031
but you know this this this blu-ray is kind of close to 30 pounds in,0.097386695
the price range and I really think that for that sort of money you should,0.08077784
be getting a little bit more than you get in this package in terms of,0.2070154
the film itself the Prix is for the most part beautiful and they did have,0.041377414
to source the first act of the movie from an inferior source and so that,0.16642693
is quite noticeable the difference and in the start of the movie it's still perfectly,0.0555542
watchable though ultimately we are lucky to even be able to see this movie almost,0.06471611
100 years later when you consider the amount of movies that just considered lost from,0.05340757
that time that no one has any idea if any prints even exist of any,0.18807878
more and it has to be said man there really I can't imagine there's a,0.057277333
better way to watch the cabinet dr. Caligari than this I'd like to say the,0.06666788
actual print on the movies is you know the best quality of going to see,0.06849443
for the film and you know the color tint is really nice as well you,0.058149915
know the what they've done with Bay's is quite admirable actually overall I'd say that,0.06976871
this set definitely isn't for everyone but I mean if you want to throw down,0.12614374
the money you are going to get a quality set and if you can you,0.10972103
know put aside the kind of not lack of bonus features because there are plenty,0.10193312
of bonus features but then it's the level of bonus features you'd expect from saying,0.056497663
an arrow video release and those are great releases of course but I mean when,0.07192663
you think about they're you know they're real limited edition releases which don't cost as,0.15535967
much as visted you know like The Texas Chainsaw - limited edition that has like,0.09270001
two discs of just bonus features basically this really first money should have more but,0.05869554
other than that is a pretty very pretty cool set I've got so overall cabinet,0.10290434
of dr. Caligari is you know the head of its field really in terms of,0.11645882
you know silent horror German expressionist cinema is a is a really really interesting movie,0.2518407
to watch it's not that long you know this it's a nice easy easy watch,0.1489549
in terms of finding the time to sit down and get into it and yet,0.105049655
so it's a real Trailblazer I mean I see no reason why this film isn't,0.097237855
worthy of a nine out of ten there really aren't any problems with it that,0.06503449
I can I can point out yeah overall the cabinet dr. Caligari is a pretty,0.07345529
great movie I have to say thank you very much for watching ladies and gentleman,0.10131205
