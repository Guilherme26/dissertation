what's up guys my name is Aaron today I'm going to be reviewing Dunkirk Dunkirk,0.08485101
is the latest movie by Christopher Nolan basically like a retelling of the Meza actually,0.09716987
happened in Dunkirk World War two and it stars Tom Hardy Killian Murphy Mark Rylance,0.27403915
Kenneth Branagh and a lot of different actors and stuff it's moving I'm not like,0.100489676
a huge Chris foreknown fan I do think he's a really good director definitely one,0.110703506
of the best but I don't know if I like personally connect to his movies,0.1196613
like I do a lot of directors like of his generation like Paul Thomas Anderson,0.1105026
David Fincher Sofia Coppola I don't know if I really connect with this movie so,0.18482919
much as those people but I do think he's a really talented director I think,0.18758069
that movies like The Dark Knight and the prestige is definitely classics to me he's,0.08255621
made like a lot of important movies in the past so I do think he's,0.07529375
a really respected director so in that he has his hands on I'm going to,0.060830574
give it a watch because he's that even that talented to me what I didn't,0.10648162
expect was just to be like one my favorite Nolan movies I really wasn't that,0.14398661
high for this but I was just only surprised I think this is really good,0.060213532
what I do like about this is like the actual atmosphere of the movie it,0.07371299
really puts you in these soldiers shoes and stuff like that feels really authentic to,0.06889915
the time like the costumes the weapons that they use though vehicle that they use,0.078510635
even including like the planes of stuff like that it all feels like like you're,0.14514542
in that time period like I feel like a cuties in that way that it,0.10075147
honestly looks like it was actually made in the 40s or 50s like it doesn't,0.069799244
feel like a modern movie and that's kind of in a good way the sound,0.08534916
design is really immersive like it really puts you in the soldier shoes and stuff,0.11712854
like that and it really makes you feel what they're feeling like I was like,0.06943936
really tense the entire time I was watching the movie and that's a really good,0.08711733
job with the sound design I guess what movie it just really puts you in,0.061973225
their shoes I really like those 10 scenes that really focus on like the soldiers,0.091398425
trying to navigate how to get out of the situation after in like the beginning,0.08103753
works just like super wordless and there's no talking but it's like in this like,0.0872279
house I can away from my peoples might be out himself like that it feels,0.15192203
really like heightened and it really puts you in that solder shoes without really like,0.0993348
telling you what is happening so like that you just really figure out as he's,0.13209428
going along and stuff and it really puts you in his shoes the other thing,0.07943696
I like what's going to be a lot like it didn't really like explain who,0.085763305
these people were and what they were doing before they had the war and stuff,0.30229825
like that like with a lot of war movies they really try to do that,0.10462563
like character description and stuff like that I really feel like they're truly trying to,0.062485844
make you relate to them what you always say oh I had a wife or,0.06254119
whatever like that before I came out here and just like we know this stuff,0.11552627
I don't need to rehash the type of things that I feel like an actual,0.089158125
war situation like that you really want to be talking about that type of stuff,0.2045108
but you would just be trying to get the help out of there and that's,0.07755644
really what this movie try to convey it's like it really makes you feel like,0.08084001
this is how you would actually act a war like running away trying to save,0.13565049
people so that not really thinking about yourself in the situation like it's just you,0.25881252
just really are just trying to get out of this situation so like that and,0.064795725
that moves we really conveys that with a different on ways of the child approach,0.084738046
that with the land like the soldier that was trying to get away by the,0.078620315
sea lettuce innocence or trying to save people and buy hair wear the soldier is,0.0881621
trying to shoot down targets of like the kind of help to people on his,0.44667444
side and stuff like that you really do get a sense of what these people,0.1788035
are trying to do without the movie sitting down and explaining that to us and,0.07284459
I do appreciate no one for doing that aspect of the movie I do think,0.10802918
the theme a movie is basically like survival of what you will do in the,0.10714591
situations like that the movie does that without really telling you that the theme of,0.06564914
the movie is else is what I got for the movie and it really kind,0.08432829
of shows you that with the two soldiers on the land Tommy so like beyond,0.07263651
Whitehead is kind of like the good-good nature side of severe evil war he's trying,0.26954243
to do the right thing and trying to help people in a situation as much,0.069758356
as he can and then it's kind of on the flip side with Alex so,0.074053556
by Harry Styles who is really just trying to look out for himself and just,0.06945544
try to get out the situation as best as he can I thought that the,0.078445315
two actors really did a good job trying to convey their different modes of that,0.1092772
and it really felt really authentic and I was real surprised by their acting and,0.061243176
I really really surprised by Harry Styles I was like why is Christopher Nolan getting,0.06634363
Harry Styles to be in a serious movie but he does a really good job,0.09644202
it was a little bit distracting but first because you're just like that's Harry Styles,0.19008613
in a war movie this is weird but it is a really good job with,0.15066902
his character I think the veteran actors like Tom Hardy Kenneth Branagh killing and Murphy,0.40323168
and Mark violence they do a lot of stuff with their roles even though they're,0.23186862
not in the movie a lot those actors really did a lot with a minimal,0.10426156
light dialogue they had I really think that Harry Styles actually had the most dialogue,0.0668183
this movie which is really good to say you know Christopher Nolan movie but the,0.14693767
actors all did a really good job with the worlds that they were given we,0.05622481
would look like a lot of dialogue to any of them what if this is,0.07821082
like a perfect movie these aren't like major problems amoeba trees with some things that,0.31089434
I had like I thought that the sea part of the movie which is kind,0.0663563
of focused on more islands character wasn't as gripping as a other part you can,0.08032556
feel as urgent as like the land stuff or the air stuff it isn't really,0.03411574
pushing in there as much as those parts of movies did and I think that,0.08529295
kind of slowed down the pacing on the movie have time to look at that,0.079716295
but I guess I was the problem the movie and I do get the importance,0.09496592
of it but it just kind of slowed down my enjoyment I guess it's kind,0.17660595
of thrown out of pace I also think that the way that he approached a,0.12448517
story that kind of focusing on these three separate narrative the land the sea and,0.061899565
the air was interesting and it really kind of real off-guard like you would be,0.15551108
in these situations but I just felt like at times it felt kind of gimmicky,0.063839816
to me and it felt like I don't know like it kind of was just,0.08285534
a little bit too sentimental especially was like the sea part of the movie but,0.12817909
overall I think this is a really great movie I don't know what the replay,0.11177544
value of this is going to be like I don't know I would probably watch,0.11628544
this again I'm outside is like a maybe in theatre so I don't think I,0.15137418
probably watched like a whole or whatever like that am i doing this is a,0.110393405
really great movie with donating like technical aspects like this movie looks gorgeous especially during,0.082444206
the air parts of movies I do think that acting is really good and the,0.05385781
theme is really clear-cut without it being too preachy anything like that but I do,0.17739348
think that the pacing is kind of off in some parts and I do think,0.11947572
that the narrative is kind of gimmicky at points overall I'll give us an 8,0.052489463
out of 10 I definitely think this is probably one of no-one's best movies but,0.08102513
I'll probably have to go over my ranking but I think this is probably my,0.039680175
top three no our movies so yeah those are my thoughts on Dunkirk what do,0.13096951
you guys thought did you like it did you hate it let me know comments,0.32084122
