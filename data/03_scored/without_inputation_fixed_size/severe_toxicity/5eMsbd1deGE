this year if you're new to this channel my name is medium and in here,0.024706917
i aim to talk about classic movies and discover and discuss what makes them so,0.027736828
special and also the people who made them possible i'm devoting the whole month of,0.052324675
november to hopefully talk about a film noir movie each day thank you so much,0.034881566
for joining me today because we have one of my favorite film noirs of all,0.050265267
time and beyond that one of my favorite films will stop and that is none,0.0211708
other than double indemnity so sit back relax because we're going to talk about film,0.06651969
noir magic here and so with no more ado let's jump into it there's a,0.18092996
quote by alfred hitchcock saying since double indemnity the two most important words in motion,0.07993246
pictures are billy and wilder and that is just a hint of the extent of,0.023408478
the impact that double indemnity had upon its release and furthermore the movie has persistently,0.055694498
and quite rightfully so as one of the best examples of film noir i'm sure,0.044003893
wilder wasn't aware that he was filming a film noir but he certainly helped shape,0.023949938
the themes the atmosphere the archetypes the characters that made and continue to make this,0.010785953
genre so popular and so fascinating having said that this is also a film that,0.03191152
beyond any genre it's a billy wilder movie and one of the greatest assets of,0.04135846
this film as in most of the movies by wilder is the script is the,0.027722193
writing for double indemnity it had not only one fantastic writer but three wilder who,0.098930106
frequently worked with a writing partner in this period was normally charles brackett who for,0.010695488
this movie stepped out of the project found in this case in raymond chandler who,0.052439753
was an accomplished crime fiction writer the best possible writing partner to adapt a fantastic,0.0960452
novella by james malahan kane another prominent figure of crime fiction and quite frankly these,0.08577011
two writers are my favorites the relationship between chandler and wilder in this movie was,0.020344641
far from ideal they clashed many times but the results of the movie are outstanding,0.01376265
you can even see for a brief moment chandler in this movie who makes a,0.048553083
cameo and it's the only time he appeared in movies and also james malhankan was,0.031225717
very pleased very happy with the results of their adaptation of his original novella and,0.02363331
that's something that doesn't happen often so kudos to chandler and wilder the original novel,0.044134934
was based on a true crime that took place in 1927 when ruth snyder and,0.040533632
her lover killed her husband to get double indemnity in her husband's life insurance and,0.68349355
that he was a writer whose work was frequently brought to the screen and you'll,0.02081027
probably be familiar with also mildred pierce and the postman always rings twice two of,0.012427626
his most famous and fantastic work so as you can see we're dealing here with,0.011389939
heavy powerhouses billy wilder in turn was predominantly known for writing and then directing comedies,0.027259892
and with this movie he raced above all genres as not only a fantastic sharp,0.11106106
writer but also as a great filmmaker in double indemnity he used voice overs we,0.022064807
have a quite amount executives but in any case it's remained one iconic from fatale,0.01860053
of the genre who is also marvelously dressed by eddie head and she plays a,0.050881892
ruthless yet super charismatic lady that it's again right up there with the best examples,0.091593795
of this very cinematic archetype so they are razor sharp dialogues full of sexual innuendo,0.4383367
and i think that especially the voice over the fred mcmurray who plays walter neff,0.035066485
the main character of this movie has it is beyond amazing and i think it's,0.046245564
been spoofed many times when they try to recreate the genre in a comedic way,0.060537033
and again especially fred mcmurray's character with lines like i couldn't hear my footsteps it,0.057625525
was the walk of a dead man or how could have i known that murder,0.3971963
sometimes smell like honeysuckles let me tell you that he plays here in my opinion,0.0874497
even though he has fantastic co-stars like again barbara stanway or edward g robinson i,0.11710159
think that fred mcmurray in this movie is outstanding he was cast against type in,0.056363672
fact i think all of them are cast against type because in mcmurray's case he,0.13930143
was predominantly known for playing good guys in light comedy screwball comedies in the 30s,0.07683936
and 40s too barbara stanway in turn had played dramas had had terrific performances in,0.04443161
comedies too pre-code dramas prank copper dramas certainly very intense but she had never played,0.059067644
a role like this before and conversely edward g robinson who was known mostly for,0.07743935
playing gangsters in the 30s he plays here quite an agreeable character in fact the,0.04911849
chemistry he has with fred in this movie is the sweetest i think relationship that,0.028297577
we see in double indemnity so i think that they were all again cast against,0.080334894
type and it worked wonders it's one i think of the successes of this movie,0.02441357
aside from the writing the movie released in 1944 also the year that as i,0.021694299
said in my previous video phantom lady laura were also released it helped in a,0.07756241
way launched the genre and it became clear that audiences were very keen at that,0.01427218
time to watch this type of stories brought to the screen one of the most,0.021297185
captivating things about this film is the fact that crime is associated with relatively ordinary,0.060362756
people so unlike 30s gangster movies where crime was attributed to criminals in this case,0.13344449
as also happened with phantom lady crime happens to again relatively common people but there,0.06684896
is that element that is so fantastic that the genre brought and is that fatality,0.032008637
we are watching characters that are doomed from the get-go and there's that element of,0.0126670925
there's no escaping my fate and it also presents characters that don't show any regret,0.0347013
for the crimes they commit it's more like an stoic acceptance of what's coming to,0.043608773
them and that's quite fascinating and in turn quite revealing of the era in which,0.03434942
these movies were made and released i particularly love the scene in which the crime,0.12246829
is committed i think that the way it was shot in which we can only,0.12806913
see barbara stanwick's face the way she acts in that scene is amazing and it,0.13626952
is one of my favorite scenes from the movie it is also known that billy,0.025611566
wilder filmed two endings for the movie which i'm obviously not going to reveal but,0.13813403
i'll only say that the one that it's in the actual movie is quite characteristic,0.03914406
of wilder's work so again we have many elements that helped shape film noir but,0.021656385
this is also very much a billy wilder film so for those of you who,0.1115819
are not that familiar with the genre but do love wilder's work you cannot miss,0.023713797
