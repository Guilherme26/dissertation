hey everybody today,0.05170371
I'm going to be reviewing the black Klansmen this film is directed by Spike Lee Spike Lee is somebody that is very famous of course some I say infamous he's known for being a very outspoken auteur artists as well as an activist,0.27595147
he's made a career out of making very socially and politically charged films and you have to admit whether you love it or you hate him,0.35449383
he is never boring for the most part a lot of the things,0.11250676
he does whether he falls flat on his face or he excels is he does it with gusto,0.49301437
and he does it with a lot of passion which you you have to admire he is extremely hit or miss with me,0.32714865
there are times when I watch some of his films like 25th hour for example,0.15474084
it's one of my favorite movies ever or do the right thing another classic,0.08789047
one of the great masterpieces he ever made I watched those and I just like want to kiss him on the forehead and just praise him for these these wonderful works that he's given us,0.38335216
and then at other times I just want to be like you,0.08745339
and that's how I feel about a lot of things,0.077751026
he's done in recent years,0.051387317
but I had heard good things about black Klansmen,0.2622302
so you know I actually was interested this is based on a true story that occurred in the 1970s in the Colorado Police Department Roth stallworth is the main character,0.045198247
and he is a black man who ends up becoming the first black police officer in the police department first investigator and they of course referred to him as the Jackie Robinson of the police department and one day he comes across an advertisement in the newspaper for the Ku Klux Klan so he just on a whim calls the number and pretends to be a white man who wants to join and become a member,0.25262606
he does so because I mean it's a promising lead and he needs something that's bold and something to get him noticed and maybe he could get some good Intel along the way and he does a really good job,0.11703139
but the one problem is at the very end,0.0829159
he has a slip,0.1153049
he makes a mistake and he actually gives his real name Ron stallworth naturally that's an issue,0.22225891
so one of his colleagues Adam driver poses as the the white version of Ron Stallworth as they try to basically work from the inside out exposing the KKK for me,0.31089434
the idea of identity is very prominent theme throughout the movie and even with within this particular story,0.04043216
you've got both characters the Adam driver character and and the the Washington character they both have the name Ron stallworth their identities are always up in the air always in question and it's kind of asking what does your identity say about you in relation to the society that you live,0.103431515
in like for instance Ron talks about being able to speak like a white man when he needs to but he can also speak jive,0.43957028
he knows that because certain parts of society expect him to be one way and another side expects him to be another,0.09933902
and how do you change accordingly even with Adam driver he is playing a Jewish man in this movie,0.3160993
he's he's pretending that,0.15534571
he's not Jewish,0.45063978
you have multiple points of view going on in this movie and there is a lot of stereotyping and kind of cartoonish portrayals of the different types of characters,0.09391811
but I will say I think that there's a lot of truth in it as well having a black man working from inside,0.4928058
the KKK is of course a really compelling idea but even just the idea that a black man the only black man in the police force is working,0.630015
within the department this is brought up to him saying that you are a police officer you are betraying your own people for being a pig as they say a pig or a cop,0.7221703
so we've been using that kind of rhetoric against cops,0.19505236
you know they they are real people too even though they do have a bit of a reputation at times and in the film there is a character that kind of represents that he's like that one bad cop or that that racist cop,0.40331116
but the rest of the cuffs defend him because ultimately they're a family and they have to stick together and you can kind of understand why they do that,0.11939954
they have their own family that they've worked to build just like the Klan members have their own family,0.17279923
just like the black activists are their own family,0.4985357
so everybody has their reasons for why they're defending themselves,0.09392453
and if I'm gonna quote rules of the game yet again this movie has a really frenzied quality to it,0.07048362
but my favorite scenes tend to be the more quiet scenes I know shocker there but yeah my favorite scene honestly it's a very small one and not necessarily that important but it's worth flip or the the Adam driver character is talking about his Jewish identity and he talks about how you know it never meant anything to him really it,0.24146096
he didn't use it,0.06363324
as something that to define him until the moment he is harassed by a Klan member who's trying to get him to prove that he's not Jewish,0.43715936
and now all of a sudden it's all that he can think about his Jewish identity,0.35501987
it's a really quiet moment,0.09333973
it's a really reflective moment,0.0751051
and I think an intelligent one of a poignant one I like the juxtaposition between all the chaos and then the column and I do think that this movie I like that it's as ambitious as it is as I said there is a lot going on it is messy at times but with Spike Lee I don't sometimes I'm able to excuse the messiness like I don't think that that necessarily detract from it for some reason that just kind of contributes to the authenticity of the work a lot of the time he's using a lot of subgenres staples like blaxploitation tropes and things like that,0.15480308
and all of that just it has a certain quality to it,0.071092024
it's got kind of a funky and cool sort of thing but at times cheap as well those kinds of films they are culturally distinct,0.2408717
and I think that he kind of wants the same thing with his own films,0.31089434
and this is after all a pastiche work,0.08018985
so he's using a lot of different film clips as well especially ones from like old movies old Hollywood movie such as Gone with the Wind and lots of clips from clips from Birth of a Nation and he does very strange things like he adds weird sound effects and weird voiceovers to them that definitely were not there originally,0.082381
I think he just wants you to always be aware that you are watching a movie when you watch this particular film because movies film is an extremely powerful medium,0.10790324
I think it's a lot more powerful than people give it credit for the way that you view people is often personified in the art,0.06892304
that you're creating the way,0.09908422
people are treated the way,0.0586061
people are portrayed,0.10178591
I think it says a lot about how society feels about these sorts of people's in ways that they feel like they can disguise under the the kind of the masks of entertainment a film like Birth of a Nation for instance is a very important film a controversial one but just important in terms of film history,0.09678696
and you know it also is kind of known for helping to revive the the Ku Klux Klan but at the same time I mean there is something to be said for the film I mean for those of you who have seen it,0.15206228
you know it's it's an incredible piece of work very very very ambitious,0.128037
he's very aware of these cultural effects,0.19408269
and so he wants to make a movie that is very accessible,0.095689386
and one that is just on a basic level entertaining like this,0.07562869
one is it's very funny,0.06555515
it's got attitude and energy and it's got a theatrical quality to it as well and it's accessibility is part of its appeal,0.09560076
so he can convey his perspective through that palatability,0.060188845
I have to say I thought that I mean there's a lot of very funny performances in this movie but Topher Grace was wonderful as David Duke and I never thought I would say that about Topher Grace and I also never thought I'd see Topher Grace playing David Duke he is so deadpan and in his delivery in this movie and part of that is very very humorous,0.20998602
but also eerie,0.08031769
and especially what he's talking about the rhetoric he's using but how that's contrasted with this kind of matter-of-fact way speaking it's a really good performance and a lot of the performance is as hammy as they are worked for me in this context and again it's it's all just part of Leigh's style which has always been very just in-your-face,0.09577449
yeah I did say that this movie is a little bit all over the place at times and I think that it could have done with a little bit more focus here in there,0.108858116
but at the same time the frenzied nature of it kind of contributes to the overall feeling because this is a movie that is about chaos about racism in a very divided world,0.15403113
I wasn't too keen about how they ended this movie,0.10193024
I feel like it kind of fizzles and we're left with footage that's coming from the modern day basically and I I don't know something about that rubs me the wrong way I don't know if I feel like it was necessary on one hand it does feel a little bit on the nose and it feels preachy,0.13940437
but on the other hand it does contribute to that whole pastiche filmmaking that I mentioned adding the information from the modern day but I don't know I just wish it came together a little bit more gracefully in a more kind of clean manner,0.07968602
but you know I gotta say when I when I watched the movie at first,0.08950976
I didn't know how I felt about it walking out,0.090216205
I didn't really feel like talking about it,0.07107478
I just kind of wanted to let the the juices marinate up here a little bit,0.24079655
and it took almost 24 hours before I kind of started think you know I this movie won me over the more I thought about it the more I think I I actually really liked it,0.05736734
it's definitely one of Lee's better movies that he's made in a long time for wants to see him have that energy that he used to have is really nice for me,0.100250676
this is one of the better movies that he's made in a long time,0.15091863
the one thing that I've always loved and admired about him is that he's he is so bold,0.40339056
he is so confident in his style and that color and all that passion just radiates from him and I just feel like the lights have dimmed for a long time so to see this kind of this this movie kind of pop the way that it does just kind of invigorated me it gave me hope for Spike Lee and that's my review,0.16939934
