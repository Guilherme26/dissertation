higher the parents dealing with it and then what happens when they actually have to,0.036469422
come in contact with these creatures and so the movie doesn't really give you that,0.09255014
much of a backstory as to how these creatures got here what happened how'd everybody,0.15270004
disappear or if everyone disappeared basically it starts off from date 89 and what I,0.23977236

woman by the name of Millicent Simmons I really enjoyed her character okay cuz you,0.2296606

more enjoyable I would have to say this is kind of like a Walking Dead,0.43711114
- the zombies mix with a little bit of signs because why say Walking Dead,0.31089434
is just because hearing the silence and basically is just you surviving with your family,0.1090875
