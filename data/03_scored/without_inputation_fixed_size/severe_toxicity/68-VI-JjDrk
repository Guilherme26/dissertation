from [Applause] all right so let's see now if this movie is worth all the,0.02513596
hype my name is Brendan Keith Avery and this is just my opinion hey what's,0.036756717
going on everyone thank you so much for tuning into my appearance lash review for,0.23907088
a star is born I really do appreciate it now this family stars born is,0.021756161
a remake of the 1937 original film of the same name which I have not,0.019383451
seen and actually this is the fourth film that is being remade by the same,0.023923995
title the interesting thing is the past three film was one of the main protagonists,0.036429446
in the film which Bradley Cooper is playing in this new age one in 2018,0.018761504
his name was Norman but in this film here his name is Jack so that's,0.039538518
one of the differences that I noticed when I was trying to look up some,0.0137446895
information and Bradley Cooper is the writer and director of this film this is also,0.022334872
his directorial debut and I'll just go ahead and say that he did a damn,0.40207145
good job you know he actually said in the past that he wanted to get,0.0103196595
into directing before acting but sometimes things just don't work out the way that we,0.028187158
planned but you know of course he's a great actor and I can now say,0.0496686
that he is a great director at least based on this film now there has,0.030115524
been a lot of buzz with this film right here it debuted at a I,0.06918841
think it was the Venice Film Festival earlier this year in August 13 August 31st,0.01247951
of this year after the film play after it finished you know they got a,0.009740284
Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga they got a standing ovation for about eight minutes and there's,0.0996638
been so much Oscar buzz around this film to saying you know how great the,0.04159726
performances is and you know all that good stuff and it is gonna get some,0.032580696
occur Oscar recognition and I will go ahead and say that I do agree with,0.009653145
that I'm just going to say that this is a fantastic film it's a beautiful,0.0473511
film I would be pretty surprised if it did not get any type of Oscar,0.05129364
nom nominations or even win but why not only because it's a great story but,0.018874586
we have some great performances by both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga herself now I,0.033780687
am not necessarily a little Gaga fan I don't have anything against her but I,0.031157201
can say that after watching this movie right here I am a fan of Lady,0.13934001
gaga I mean she did a great job singing on stage on screen and she,0.07782449
did a great job performing and this movie right here is going to make me,0.06663278
want to pay attention to her work going on now in the future but like,0.024406917
why is this movie good to me why is it so great like I said,0.046611413
it's a great story is full of passion and emotions and I'm just really fond,0.037247624
of like where the film focused what it's about is Bradley Cooper's character Jack he,0.009068449
is a seasoned music musician he has some alcohol and drug problems that he's dealing,0.048948202
with you know but he's still you know a fantastic musician and you know just,0.03318202
by you know going around the block or by look or however you want to,0.022404715
say it he runs into Lady Gaga's character by the name of Allie and you,0.029725062
know he just sees something in her and just once her to reach these these,0.045263086
Heights you know he wants her to reach these goals of being you know the,0.022080772
best new songwriter slash musician and he's just kind of helping her along the way,0.03356583
now this feeling might here could have copied on a lot of the cliche tropes,0.022968791
you know three-act structure of a film to where you know you see the rise,0.03512236
in the fall of you know a said actor actress or you know performer musician,0.10948258
or something like that and how it focuses on you know how they try to,0.02628207
you know go into the media and try to cater to everyone and become like,0.019339548
the next best pop star and things like that and how it turns them down,0.11776278
you know on the inside out and things like that know this film didn't really,0.02689537
focus on that at all what it focused on was the characters themselves and their,0.034052745
relationship and you know just kind of how they dealt with things and I was,0.02542465
just about to give us full up but I don't I don't want to do,0.023113802
that but you know the song choices in this family here are just beautiful I,0.013587707
mean they really had a lot of weight to them and meaning and you felt,0.041404355
it when you know they were singing on stage and Lady Gaga also said in,0.022175893
the past interview that she is tired of looking at movies to where the actors,0.045478605
or actresses are trying to pretend and live synch with the real songs and they,0.029963862
really just don't do a great job there and of course she would have a,0.034478463
great eye because she is a real life you know recording artist so she kind,0.118337505
of knows her stuff she knows her lane as far as that's concerned so her,0.049449753
I'm Bradley Cooper did get together and practice singing live on stage you know off,0.03885404
camera and on camera and you know that practice paid off because they just made,0.030194016
a great duet on screen on stage and you know I just thought it was,0.030904433
really fantastic Bradley Cooper also say to himself in a couple of many views that,0.05864259
he took singing for granted because he just really did not know how are difficult,0.03826735
it was but he did take some voice acting not voice acting but voice lessons,0.050797414
just to you know really hit the nail down center home you know to give,0.08367478
a great performance but you know like I said the film didn't focus on all,0.015215411
that extra crap it really focused on their relationships and the demons that they have,0.65675664
to deal with and you know when we're with me a regular consumer a regular,0.053433537
person or whatever one we see Beyonce or little Wayne or Lady Gaga or whoever,0.06854784
the hell that is performing whether they're on the movie screen the TV show or,0.2005695
recording artists or whatever we kind of put them on a pedestal that they're just,0.07790232
like the perfect being and they have their life together and just there's nothing wrong,0.06600684
and they just wake up every day freshly bathed don't even have to wipe under,0.13467109
their arms and put on deodorant and this is everything is just you know great,0.088227294
and wonderful for them but no this film right here kind of just takes it,0.046797
gives you a different perspective of their life and just kind of shows you you,0.07789766
know everything that you know these normal people you know have to deal with there,0.032376483
was even a couple of scenes to where you know like it's kind of rude,0.08705125
to wear when you see a celebrity you kind of just jump off in their,0.33795297
face like hey can I take a picture kind of like a picture that Yatta,0.044967744
Yatta me and then you know like they just want to eat their hamburger on,0.15334545
fire - or wood or whatever you know I'm saying like everybody else they don't,0.07800343
want to be bothered and the film kind of dealt with it and I like,0.056424204
the way that they dealt with him I kind of said that back to back,0.08746633
another thing that was just kind of fascinating to me is just like their relationship,0.02546456
and you know just kind of how they handle this certain situation that you know,0.023058591
they had to go through and like different hardships and things like that and one,0.029351229
of the things that spoke to me the most when I was watching this film,0.039918337
is in something that I can relate to something that I did we're going up,0.00938042
as always wrong about what other people think of you and that you shouldn't do,0.037001505
that it's just really none of your business you know do your thing don't worry,0.046677932
about what other people think and if you really have if you truly really just,0.022426002
have somebody that's down for you like a down-ass chick or down as dude or,0.76388645
whatever you know I'm saying that just has your back no matter what there's your,0.06986025
support system right there that's all you have to worry about as far as somebody,0.022303607
worrying about you all that other stuff is just you know random noise that you,0.03270708
can you know just let go through one ear and out the other and you,0.053762138
know this film really put that on the forefront but it was a beautiful film,0.03768199
great performances great acting great singing great passion great emotion I didn't tear up or,0.029716413
anything like that when I was watching it but I can hear all those sniffles,0.05755834
and you know runny noses and all that when the theater when I was watching,0.09034192
other people just getting really emotional and so I really do recommend you see this,0.04795708
film is like I said it's fantastic it's just the beautiful film on so many,0.046739127
levels and I would really be surprised if it did not get any type of,0.048443995
Oscar attention if I had the rate of stars born out of a 1 out,0.032953862
of 10 I will give this a nine point five out of 10 yes a,0.059328396
nine point five out of 10 but guys that is just my opinion have you,0.03581083
