you know I had a dream that one day someone would actually make a film about Martin Luther King jr. and handle it in a very truthful accurate and respectful manner and it looks like that dream has come true hey guys the black corner guy today I'm here to review the film Selma now the film Selma takes place in a very tumultuous time in US history where segregation was alive and well in the south and it follows the demonstrations and peaceful protests by Martin Luther King jr. and how he got it all together none of my knowledge and I could be wrong about this but I don't think there has ever been a theatrical film made about Martin Luther King jr. sure there's been a lot of TV movies TV specials documentaries and miniseries about the man but never a full-on theatrical film about Martin Luther King and it could be because with all of his contributions to the world and countless of good things he has done to sum it all up in a two-hour long movie I just wouldn't do the man any justice so I guess nobody wanted to attack that but seeing Selma I think they really picked a very monumental time in Maher Luther King's life to show on the big screen and what I really appreciate about this film is that it does it takes place after all the things that we really remember Maher Luther King 4 it takes place after his speech at Washington DC it takes place after he won his Nobel Peace Prize it takes place after all the major events that we've come to know about Martin Luther King and it's like the events afterwards this takes place I believe in 1965 in Selma Alabama and I really praised the movie for doing that they easily could have been like this is the life of Martin Luther King we're gonna go through all of it and we're gonna end on like the big speech though they actually address one key moment in Maher Luther King's life basically they pulled a Lincoln with this movie we're focused on one major event in the man's life and really showed it to us and in my honest and humble opinion I believe that this was the perfect time for a film like Selma to be released especially after all the events that have occurred in the last few years because people need to be reminded of the struggle of the trials and tribulations that the people face back in the 1950s and 60s they need to be reminded of the people that sacrifice their lives to give us the rights that we have today and people need to be inspired to make a change and needless to say I thought that someone was a great and fantastic film and one that I truly respect in the fact that it doesn't really follow the same trend as other films that talk about the civil rights movement before it I mean yes they do shine a light on the civil rights movement and they do show it as a justification to it and I found that so intriguing I was hoping that this film could stand out amongst the other civil rights type films and I think that it truly does and it stands out for many reasons the biggest one being its portrayal of the man that was Martin Luther King jr. they do not put this guy on a pedestal they do not treat him as a God among men as I've seen in TV specials and heard in documentaries they show dr. King for what he truly was he was a man he had faults he had a lot of faults that were addressed in the film he had doubts there was a scene where he's in the jail cell he's talking to one of the people that I can guessing is his friend and he's talking about you know is what we're doing really going to help is it really going to change you know we could get a man to sit down in a dining table but he can't pay for the burger at the diner he had hesitations this was same where he's standing on the bridge he's wondering whether I should push forward or if he should just turn back he was a man and I loved how the film humanized dr. King they in put him on a pedestal that is the most perfect representation of King I've seen in a movie thus far and that is all attributed to the excellent performance done by this guy I cannot pronounce his last name and I would hate to butcher it so I'll put his name right here but I'm gonna call him David oh this guy he did such a phenomenal job portraying dr. Martin Luther King now at first scared because his voice didn't really capture the voice that was Martin Luther King Jr's voice I've heard Martin Luther King's voice so many times I could tell it from a mile away but when I heard his voice didn't really sound like him and I was a little scared and hesitant to really see him as Martin Luther King but as the film continued I just got sucked into his performance especially when he is preaching to the crowd I felt the presence of Martin Luther King right there I could feel it radiating out of him I hope he gets nominated I don't know if he'll win but if he gets nominated I'm gonna be so happy because his performance is truly Oscar worthy one of the best performances I've seen of the year though riding in the film was excellent and I loved how they addressed all the struggles all the pressure and all the conflict that dr. King had to face during the Selma protest you would think that a film called Selma would only focus on the town of Selma and what Martin Luther King jr. did in that town but no the film also addresses what he was dealing with meeting with the president in Washington DC and trying to push the Voting Rights Act it shows his marital struggle to keep his marriage alive because there's a lot of issues going on right there I love that the film addressed this because I've heard about for years but I always thought no one would ever see that port in film and they did they addressed it in this film to actually put it on screen and gave it so much attention and focus I love that now although I felt like the film's representation of the march and the brutality by the police was done very well and unfiltered I felt like they kind of withheld on showing a little bit more of the gruesomeness of that scene I felt like it was probably more gruesome and more damaging than what we actually saw but for the scene that were there they were brutal and they were really hard to watch it was just gut-wrenching to think that people would actually do like this and it did happen and the sad part is it continues to happen I was like the fact that they gave dr. King a sense of humor I mean there are some scenes where he's talking to his buddies and it just feels like a natural conversation and they're just joking around I wish the more scenes like that but of course it's all about the events that are going down the struggles that he's facing but it would have been nice to see more downtime that dr. King had with his friends I mean those scenes were really well done it really captures the normal life that dr. King sort of lived now and again I guess the last thing I want to talk about and praise about this film was the acting I already praised David OHS performance of dr. King but everybody else also did a really good job and there's just so many notable performances like I thought Tom Wilkinson did a really good job at portraying lyndon b johnson i felt like he captured him perfectly overall guys i love this film this film really touched me it really spoke to me this is probably one of the best films about the civil rights movement i probably have ever seen it if i had seen it in 2014 it definitely would have been in my top ten of the year and it would have been number one that's how great it was all the performances were solid they were genuine everything about this film I just felt like clicked and I could not take my eyes off the screen I was in trans by the story at the events that were occurring on screen and the performances that each and every actor and actress in this film gave it is an amazing and phenomenal film and I really hope that you guys go and check it out because it is getting the highest grade it could ever get on this channel that's the 5 out of 5 but it's not an epic masterpiece it's just a masterpiece it's an excellent work of film and I just loved it and in recommending films that are very similar to summer you guys should definitely check out Malcolm X starring Denzel Washington as the militant leader he does a really good job at conveying and capturing the man that was Malcolm X in fact he earned an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal that's how good it was I would also recommend that you check out Lincoln which also has a very similar set up and then it takes place in a very crucial moment in this very important person's life but anyway I would truly love to know what you guys thought about this film if you have seen it did you love it as much as I did did you feel like it was a mask Peace in an excellent film or did it just not live up to what you were hoping and he felt like it was emotionally manipulative and totally bias and let me know who is your favorite social activists somebody that fights injustice in the world comment below let me know and I know I took this review a little bit more seriously but the film called for a series of you and that's exactly what I did so until the next video comes guys if you would like to be a part of the black Critic crew and see more awesome videos on this channel please hit that subscribe button below like this video if you really enjoyed it and I'm Tory walk the second the black credit guide till then peace you too
