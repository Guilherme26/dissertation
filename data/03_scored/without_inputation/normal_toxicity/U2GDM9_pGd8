hey everybody today,0.05170371
I'm going to be talking about a parasite this film was co-written and directed by bong joon-ho he's the director that's gained a lot of momentum in terms of his international success and acclaim,0.44419137
I would say within the last 10 years or so he's a nod to her that's quite appreciated in the US and Paris that really is my first exposure to this director,0.08999193
I went in knowing almost nothing about the movie,0.0607933
and I think that that is the best way to experience it,0.06250403
if you haven't seen the film I actually recommend that you stop watching this review go watch it and then come back and see what I have to say,0.095927745
because I just think that you're gonna get a lot more out of it,0.13992707
I think the strength of this film is how it surprises you when it surprises you,0.08081935
it's never really jarring,0.064186424
in the traditional sense you know it's not kind of jolting you back and forth your emotions everything feels very seamless and in terms of the transitions,0.10542527
it feels like it's more kind of sliding and curving its way around this plot rather than taking really kind of angular corners,0.066391
it's very meticulous very controlled,0.0831779
you never know where it's gonna go tonally or in terms of the plot and that is quite refreshing,0.10462518
I often talk about movies like this it's a common theme in the movies that we see it's where you know we're talking about a director who is making a movie that is pulling from all of these very distinct very different genres from the past and sort of passing them together where you as an audience member,0.07795655
and certainly the director feels very aware of the influences where the story itself becomes more I mean as I said conscious it's it's more about how the culture has shaped,0.106291585
the point of view of this writer of this director this particular story and while this does have a lot of that in it,0.05836635
it's not that kind of movie at the same time,0.10933493
this is a film that wants to swerve in and out of these different lanes these these each Lane being a different genre but it's doing it,0.10879653
in a way that is very stealthy,0.06796456
and it's almost almost invisible at times the film is dabbling in all kinds of things at first,0.061486788
it seems to be more kind of like a like a black comedy satire,0.32037273
it has a lot of slapstick comedy but then it starts to beer more into the horror thriller genre but ultimately it is a movie that is about it's a social commentary on class struggle,0.17759444
but all of this is a homogenous blend,0.1790376
that seems to have all the flavors of all of these ideas but it's all at once and it's all one concoction and there's not a moment where you don't feel that the film is completely in control of every every beat,0.08609794
every little thing that it is saying every hair is perfectly in place,0.08043511
and there was just one moment,0.05170008
I can't even give you the context for the moment,0.11080286
I don't remember where it happened,0.059444338
I just remember seeing this image,0.042002387
it was very quick,0.057103023
but you could see kind of an image of Alfred Hitchcock,0.06629192
and I think some other people that might have influenced him,0.15842032
and that's like the one time where it really feels conscious as if to say yes I am pulling from all of these different influencers these different tours and their genres but it is so brief it it's so quick you miss it,0.11193846
and of course I'm going to pay attention to that especially being who I am I'm gonna notice all of the different ways that the story is being constructed but overall I found it to be much more palatable for me and and something more interesting because the effect of it was so subtle and so sophisticated,0.051980995
it's a very slow boil in terms of how it escalates to the climax,0.2159943
and I think having all of that beneath the service,0.1774599
having all of these these genres and the ideas behind it be almost invisible,0.20294012
it really makes the film more layered,0.06474191
it gives it a lot more complexity more dimension because it allows us to explore everything so much more keenly,0.06284384
you know we're exploring we're aware of all of these different facets in terms of the emotions on the human spectrum and we're seeing it through all of these genres which they sort of define the world they define what the world is about in all kinds of different ways all kinds of different points of view and it's exploring what life is about and how we experience it when the film began I saw this of course more as slapstick comedy because there's a lot more humor in it than I was expecting and it is,0.09864473
yeah,0.040847696
so it's like,0.06173048
it's like a black comedy about class struggle,0.4026858
and how it is shifted in the modern age is very satirical talking about even in just the first scene how they're just living for that that Wi-Fi signal that they're trying to get from other neighbors because they don't they don't have any where you know the idea of pressing send on a text message that could be really bad for you is it seems like to these people,0.11649556
it's almost like a clear bomb going off,0.37256417
it's almost the same thing pressing sin can change your whole life,0.21972892
how the DIY culture is changing everything breaking the walls down on how things can be done and who does things,0.15544754
I mean we have the ability now to be able to be able to take different jobs just by googling how to do them and are watching youtube videos on how to do things,0.10236827
and that changes everything because you don't have to have a formal education or anything like that but pretty early on I'd say especially when they start going to the actual house where the film really takes place you start to get watts of the of those thriller and horror vibes but that all comes to fruition more in the third act where everything shifts into a more off-kilter more eccentric idea of what horror is as well as the comedy where the brutality it becomes the focus,0.14890689
it's the poor working secretly underground,0.17319788
and they are literally below the upper class,0.2657373
what the movie seems to be saying is that you always have to break a few eggs to make an omelet in this sort of society one person's gain is always going to be another person's loss,0.30420262
unfortunately this movie did remind me of Jordan peels us a lot,0.21604607
that's of course a movie that came out in the United States,0.12344486
and it was earlier this year,0.05438859
but there are so many similarities because then it is also a film that is a commentary on on socio politics,0.08595225
and it is also filtered through this genre-bending lens that is it's kind of part pastiche,0.09870268
it's part comedy,0.12643798
it's part horror,0.17486444
it is part satire as well that's a movie that I did not get around to reviewing but I did like it quite a bit however I have to say that this film it takes it a lot further,0.099229895
it takes a lot of these ideas much further and it's it's more focused,0.1052884
it's more cohesive morally as well as as plot wise,0.17725302
and it's just more skillfully or skillful in terms of how it's able to manipulate the audience into feeling all of these things all of these emotions that shift all over the spectrum he'll has a great quote that I love to recite a lot because I think it's a great philosophy for him,0.09619386
but you know he was talking about his career change,0.088063516
people couldn't believe that he went to you know from like sketch comedy to all of these these auteur horror films but he said he doesn't think that it's really that that jarring of a difference he does not think that comedy is really that different from horror the the line between them is actually very thin,0.240231
and I think that parasite also embodies that idea,0.57407576
and I think that somebody like Jordan Peele would really appreciate something like parasite,0.45920035
it's the idea of how sometimes life and its ideas are just too complex to be contained within one genre life even when it is very,0.09165743
tragic is also at the same time full of a lot of awkward things,0.15512992
and funny things it's all kinds of different genres that constantly run into one another,0.07402229
I actually think that this movie parasite could more so be compared to a movie like Takashi,0.4032228
Amie case the audition or I should say audition I'm sorry I always say the UM which I feel like if you haven't seen that movie and you are interested don't watch any more of this review because I feel like I've already given you too much information or just with that that sentence don't even look at the cover of the movie you know if you can get somebody to press play for you before you watch it,0.04887902
because the less you know the better it is very similar to this film and it is also one of my favorite movies of all time,0.07102695
but for those of you who have seen it I'm sure you you know what I mean how it subtly builds from something that's very quiet contemplative very sweet and romantic and almost like it's a like an a zoo film and then it just twists and twists and twist into this so realistic horror piece and for me that that is one of the crowning achievements of being able to do that sort of thing,0.33493352
but I admire that film and I admire parasite as well I would say though that something like audition is more elevated more sophisticated for me there were a few times in parasite where I thought that there,0.23089318
were some kind of iffy lines,0.07387725
but when I say all of that I am very much nitpicking,0.081823006
another reason I think that the movie does have that emotional weight because it is a very tragic film is because all of the characters are so nuanced and so dimensional,0.084015965
you don't see the upper-class characters as villains necessarily,0.113023385
and you don't see the poor culprits as the villains either of course the Kim family is the one that we follow them where we're going on their journey from beginning to end,0.17656727
but we do also root for the the upper-class family,0.09878792
and I think part of that is is the performance by the actress who plays the the rich mother,0.08295708
I I liked a lot of the performances in this movie but hers in particular I really liked with a character like her,0.103359096
she does need to be that that that emotional center,0.10962891
she requires the ability to embody that innocence and that that gullibility and just that that natural comedic ignorance that that rich people tend to have there is something kind of endearing about it and you're sort of drawn to it because she's just just like anybody else,0.47716033
she's just living her life and she's doing what she believes is best for her family and in the same way the Kim family is doing,0.10210825
what is best for them of course the stakes are much higher for them but but it's the same sort of thing,0.06526784
but by the time you get to the third act of the movie I think each of the main players could be seen at some points as very sympathetic and at other times as as villains how the plot develops and how those character motivations develop is to me the overall strength,0.08583904
and what I said does give it that emotional art,0.09001899
because as I said this is a technical achievement but also one that really does resonate with you emotionally,0.2934938
and I think overall this movie is a total knockout,0.11006661
I think I advise everyone to see it,0.062846094
if you can because it is it's worth every minute of your time,0.19033405
and that's my review,0.07324779
