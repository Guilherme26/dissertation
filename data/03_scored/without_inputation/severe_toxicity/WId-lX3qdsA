what is up guys Stewie and welcome back to another review from the London Film,0.031566955
Festival which is feeling even stranger and stranger to say as a month keeps going,0.019549748
up to November now and I still haven't got all of my film festival reviews,0.015351773
done I guess it's a testament to my timekeeping skills which are not good and,0.0593703
today we're talking about another film which has got a whole load of buzz where,0.0326379
ever it's been shown at festivals in the year so I naturally went yep that,0.02827363
I'm gonna I'm gonna see it and that one is portrait of a lady on,0.072058015
fire it's a French romantic film directed by Celine Shama and my goodness gracious yeah,0.07990785
it's fantastic it's an amazing film I'll keep it brief on the summary for this,0.047383025
one but it's essentially the story of a woman who is tasked with painting a,0.05248432
portrait of another woman that doesn't want to have her portrait painted suddenly realize I'm,0.08603752
doing a great job of selling this one they they have the love romance you're,0.054096725
just gonna have to trust me on this one and there's not a huge amount,0.07492296
else I can say about the story without going into too many details which I,0.019004297
think might ruin the experience for you just going not knowing much that's all you,0.082543306
need to know that this film is so incredibly effective at telling a romantic story,0.035758276
and the relationship between the characters are just so perfectly executed I mean Celine sciama,0.10775909
let's just talk about her direction here which is just stunning I don't have to,0.07129106
throw my hands up here and say I haven't actually watched any of her previous,0.1729065
Direction work she did a film called girlhood which is one of hers which got,0.06712634
a lot of acclaim when it came out ever saw it though I'm terrible but,0.03095299
she has written other films which I have seen she was actually the writer behind,0.07250302
one of my favorite animated films the last few years my life is a cause,0.04054228
yet if the name made you laugh just watch the film you'll be blown away,0.11745946
I guarantee it but here there's not really anything I didn't like about the way,0.021489423
she approached this film from what I've seen of her writing work she was a,0.048589006
very effective way of approaching human relationships and really getting at the heart and humanity,0.0995301
of the story and that is absolutely present here it's a film which takes a,0.018459512
lot of time to just let the characters breathe in their moments which I know,0.036299735
can sound incredibly pretentious but it's not the first pretentious thing I've said on this,0.052995846
channel so we're just going to go with it and it's quite a simple thing,0.02544261
but I love the way that she uses a narrative of this and almost as,0.046143126
a kind of tool to get at the characters as opposed to the characters being,0.020457057
a tool to get the narrative and I just loved every second of watching these,0.051023576
characters fall in love with each other and her performances from both the actresses in,0.074488595
the lead roles are so so good here stars Adele hon L as the the,0.027197363
woman that doesn't want to be painted she does have her name still gonna say,0.08952707
it because I'm not French even better than her roles in films like unknown girl,0.2333921
and 128 beats per minute those are good roles but here she's just something else,0.034618817
she really nailed this character that's got a lot of walls up when we first,0.046328712
meet her but we gradually see her come around to certain things throughout the film,0.058808222
alongside her as the painter and I cannot give with the character names there's no,0.02164308
me Merlin I probably butchered it and we're gonna go with it the top my,0.27104816
head I don't think I've actually seen her in anything before and she smashed this,0.11884038
one she was brilliant and along side her nail the two of them just works,0.05924724
so perfectly in this film cuz you got a really great contrast between the characters,0.042385504
one starts off quite cold one of them is much more softer and warm just,0.038904596
sounded like a serial killer saying now but that makes us such an interesting dynamic,0.19088908
in their relationship so as soon as they met I was like yes I want,0.057940155
to see this happen it just feels natural and that definitely comes from the two,0.02660934
performances but it's again one of the great things about sciama as a writer and,0.028505115
director she just has a fantastic way of making all of this feel natural feels,0.059364315
authentic it feels real it doesn't feel like it's doing anything gimmicky or anything flashy,0.03571504
it's just a relationship that is perfectly explored through the means of film and that's,0.017193
where it shares quite a lot for me with a film like call me by,0.08564372
your name and I don't want to sort of dismiss this film is just like,0.05737475
a lesbian call me by your name I think to simplify it down to a,0.44464886
statement like that it doesn't do this film justice it's so much more than that,0.02812729
all that being said there are certain themes and parallels which which are the reason,0.0149214
I love a film like call me by name and a reason why I feel,0.057819758
like this works so well as well though for them deals so wonderfully in quite,0.03861391
different ways but similar ways as well with that feeling of falling in love and,0.020522911
it's kind of feeling like it's just you and this other person and it's just,0.05578363
it's just you two in the world nothing else matters in fact there's this incredible,0.047018506
line in in scamaz film here which deals so wonderfully with that and encapsulate sit,0.08129209
also perfectly at one point one of the character says to the other do all,0.012068427
lovers feel like they've invented something new it's a line which is just stuck with,0.037383985
me ever since I saw this film and perfectly encapsulates everything that is so good,0.04911317
about this film it's that feeling you get when you're experiencing something so amazing and,0.042294372
so incredible for the first time with someone else how could there be anyone else,0.04091877
that knows we're going through here and I loved that side of the relationship in,0.01958101
a way that's explored so perfectly in this film and there's a certain point from,0.020514263
this film in a similar way to call me by name where I realized I,0.0522535
was totally in with these characters I could watch them do anything and I just,0.077664845
feel like everything they're doing and saying to each other just feels so genuine and,0.018673701
I find that incredibly moving it made me feel all kinds of emotions this filled,0.05575037
but what I also found really interesting about this film is that on top of,0.018377693
the relationship which is the main bulk of this and the main thing is going,0.032226816
for there are also some really interesting decisions made from a directing point of view,0.022529105
which just sort of make a little bit spicy huh there is moments that almost,0.03502724
kind of Teeter on the brink of feeling like we're watching a thriller or some,0.026631292
kind of horrors feel strange saying it but and I hope you know what I,0.06930349
mean if you see in a film there's almost this kind of ghost-like presence in,0.064858064
a film which I wasn't a hundred percent sure what was happening at the time,0.046159755
of seeing it and then come the end of this film it all just makes,0.050195422
sense and there's a point in the climax where it all comes to a head,0.12367294
and I just I suddenly got why she done that throughout the film and it's,0.028796466
just another layer to this film which just elevates it above your bog-standard kind of,0.09342039
romantic film ultimately just film did everything right I absolutely adored it I can't wait,0.03945803
to see it again it's gorgeous to look at and just in terms of the,0.02964923
way it's shot in its cinematography but on top of that it is so brilliantly,0.30678716
performed and so stunningly directed and written it all just works perfectly it's totally deserving,0.05083267
of all the praise it's getting and you have to make sure you go out,0.061766956
and see this when it drops wherever you are but what about you guys have,0.01892647
