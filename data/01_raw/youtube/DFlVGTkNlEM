what's up guys this is Corey welcome seeing a films and animation well today I'm going to be looking at another Best Picture nominated film and today's review is of the Philadelphia Story released in 1940 through MGM this film was directed by George Cukor and it's starred Cary Grant Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart the film was based on a play a Broadway play and it's a romantic comedy of sorts about a rich woman's ex-husband who she's getting remarried and a tabloid type reporter shows up to the way the new wedding and and there she starts to learn some things about herself that you know through many different things this film won two Oscars including Best Actor in a supporting role for James Stewart and best writing and it was also nominated for Best Picture Best Actress in a leading role for Katharine Hepburn Best Actress in a supporting role for Ruth Hess hussy and Best Director for George Cukor now this film is a it's one of the most well known classics in the romantic comedy genre you know you mentioned romantic comedy this is definitely one of the biggest films you can think of especially for its time with that being said this is a very good film it's an excellent it's excellently acted and it tells a good story um however for me it wasn't a particular favorite Cary Grant plays CK Dexter Haven and he was married to Katharine Hepburn but after he started taking a alcohol after he started drinking they pretty much separated divorced and two years later she is remarrying a man named George Kittredge and you know upon the wedding just a couple days before ever shows up along with CK Dexter Haven played by James Stewart his character's name is Macaulay Connor one thing leads to another and pretty soon Katharine Hepburn starts questioning her choices and you know Marion George Kittredge and all this and it you know it's it is a good film it's it's an excellent film it's it's definitely worth all of its I guess hype it's you know like I said an excellent film an interesting tidbit that I found out was that the film was each scene was taken in just one take meaning that they didn't have to do any reduce double takes anything like that so you know they pretty much shot the entire thing once not in one take obviously but and yeah they they shot it without having to do any reduce which I found found to be very interesting there's definitely some minor comedic moments in this as far as comedies go I wouldn't necessarily call this a comedy myself I'd probably call this more of a drama but I could see where someone could find this to be funny I guess just I didn't find it all that fun humorous myself but that doesn't mean that it's bad at all it's it's definitely worth your time this is this is a classic for a reason it may not be my favorite but you know again I do think that it's an important film for you to see so I'm gonna give this film a 7 out of 10 the reason why I'm given it this is because you know I didn't particularly love it but you know at the same time I do see its importance to the cinema I do see that it's you know an excellent excellent li acted film it's very well written it's just not particularly for me so I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10 so tell me guys have you seen the Philadelphia Story if you have what you think of it did you like it did you dislike it you know what you think of the acting the script you know just all that comment below let me know if you guys liked this video be sure to LIKE favorite subscribe be sure to follow us on Facebook and Twitter I'm Corey and I'll see you guys in the next one
