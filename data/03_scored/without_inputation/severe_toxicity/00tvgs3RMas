hey everyone it's Mariana and I actually had a different video planned but apparently a,0.032772932
lot of you still haven't seen the farewell and it is easily one of the,0.0136948
best films of the year it really spoke to me personally and you just really,0.03456294
need to see it so I need to talk to you about the farewell the,0.02819248
film is written and directed by Lulu Wang and is heavily inspired by the events,0.020580117
of her own life the story revolves around a Chinese family who after learning the,0.031330816
grandmother has cancer and isn't expected to live much longer decide not to tell her,0.07018951
about this instead they're going to stage a wedding as an excuse for the family,0.051408052
to get together before she dies I think from that description alone you can probably,0.14646812
guess that this is a very emotional experience and if you've been around my channel,0.027790042
for even a little bit you know that that is something I look for in,0.047897212
a film I needed to make me care I need to make me feel things,0.108270615
and the farewell absolutely did it for me I laughed I cried I contemplated my,0.046030708
life choices and it also made me feel really hungry because oh my god all,0.027066322
of that food here's the thing though the premise sounds pretty depressing and the film,0.06295896
is not without its sad moments of course but I don't want you walking away,0.038544733
from this review thinking the movie is a huge bummer and that's all there is,0.10040016
to it it's also really funny and honest in a way that makes you empathize,0.028374739
with the characters even though you may not agree with everything they do you understand,0.026301362
where they're coming from and it exposes you to a different perspective on life on,0.03509376
family and priorities in a way it's one of those films where every single character,0.045184594
feels like a real person which I don't actually encounter that often in films and,0.04601009
this may have something to do with the fact that the farewell is based on,0.014316082
a true story or as the movie puts it on an actual lie but this,0.030168738
makes it a and a very personal experience I guarantee you're not going to come,0.035669144
out of this feeling neutral about it and for a lot of people it is,0.032301985
going to hit home aside from the main dilemma of whether or not to tell,0.12564121
a loved one that their days are numbered when there isn't anything that can be,0.041693047
done and the idea of taking on someone suffering as a family instead of letting,0.12736736
them deal with it on their own there is a secondary theme of belonging somewhere,0.030971617
and feeling a connection to what feels like home throughout the film we see the,0.009040511
main character Billy struggle with saying goodbye to her grandma not just because they're really,0.07314027
close which they are but also because she is her connection to her childhood having,0.1082307
moved to the US as a child with her parents Billy clearly feels uprooted and,0.06458734
alone and when she comes back to China for this visit nothing really feels the,0.07130436
same the places don't look the same some of the people are gone and now,0.03843032
her grandma is going to be gone too now on top of facing the death,0.28396773
of a loved one which is already hard enough obviously she also has to deal,0.040881522
with what that means as far as losing her connection to home when that home,0.0479624
is already not what she remembers it to be and speaking of Billy I have,0.07860475
to mention awkwafina's performance because she is so great in this role the whole cast,0.039509915
is great but she really blew me away here I've only seen her in crazy,0.119904675
rich Asians before and she is great in that too she's hilarious but the farewell,0.2857366
is an entirely different role which gave her a chance to show a whole different,0.012124968
side of her talent I kind of think that if I didn't know it was,0.057894923
her before watching the movie I may not have realized that this is the same,0.05556944
actress she is that good from the visual aspect I loved the way the farewell,0.037756488
was shot there are some smart and creative cinematography in there and you can get,0.038840074
a taste of it in the trailer the color palette is used really well and,0.021533325
by the music is used really well too the film is a complete package everything,0.018647093
just came together here in the best way possible I do have a couple of,0.0276896
things I couldn't it pic about but I really don't want to mainly because I,0.024943722
just really loved the film so much but also because I don't feel like they,0.021672348
make that big of a difference there was a scene which had to do with,0.02808472
food that had the most obvious in-your-face continuity errors that were really really distracting to,0.038599942
me and were distracting me from the conversation that was happening on screen and I'm,0.023327991
being super vague here on purpose half the movie has to do with food if,0.043755114
not more but I don't want you sitting there and waiting for this specific scene,0.0816034
so you can be just as distracted as I was on the off chance that,0.020363932
if you don't know what the scene is then maybe you won't notice and you,0.04078773
won't be distracted but yeah like I said minor nitpicks you really should see the,0.06367005
farewell it is wonderful and it is one of those rare films that I think,0.0571426
would work for pretty much anyone unless you're heartless then maybe not I'm giving the,0.10695089
farewell four and a half out of five stars it was really close to perfect,0.024770774
for me and I think it's going to do great on repeat viewings as well,0.041835394
and that's it for this quick review let me know what you guys thought of,0.022895621
the movie if you've seen it already and if you haven't seen it you just,0.025710678
