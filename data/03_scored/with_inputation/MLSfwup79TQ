hello everybody and welcome back to robert's reviews before we get started i wanted to,0.042842742
announce that my niece is being a little too loud today so you might hear,0.12948807
her in the background so i apologize for that soon it will not matter because,0.20879309
i will be not living here so look forward to that i know i am,0.32079026
um but uh for those of you who don't know uh once again i am,0.31089434
in a film club at oneonta suny oneonta and uh so this is my last,0.082457416
review for them until next semester but uh they had me watch singing in the,0.050010927
rain [Applause] sand of the rain was released in 1952 which is a long time,0.017688438
ago it was written by betty condon and adolf green and directed by stanley donan,0.15242773
and gene kelly uh quick little quick little fun fact first of all this is,0.14996406
a non-spoiler review although it's singing in the rain you probably know it already um,0.059390653
i was in um i was in a production of singing in the rain uh,0.06637176
five years ago i played young cosmo so if you remember from the first scene,0.07992176
of the film when he when gene kelly and them are going up to the,0.07002959
premiere they have a little flashback sequence which shows don and uh don and cosmo,0.114926435
uh in their violin dance and stuff at vaudeville and stuff and i did that,0.10788172
for my production and i did a bunch of other stuff and stage crew and,0.10469084
was also like literally stage crew for the show um so it's a lot of,0.06613254
fun uh so i've seen the show dozens of times um because i wasn't on,0.15137124
stage too long for this one um but boy is it long it's it's not,0.10970522
long here it's it really isn't but it's long for the show on stage so,0.07189185
it's even longer so this felt like a nice little breezy dream in comparison to,0.18483973
the show but um essentially what happens is we're set in the world where there's,0.04433609
black and white movies and they're only there there's no sound right that's ridiculous why,0.6316977
we didn't have sound to a movie um and it's about the invention of the,0.051973674
sound that can go with the movies and basically what happens we have don lockwood,0.070710555
we have lena lamont and lena lamotte talks a lot like this right which sounds,0.14171843
ridiculous um and the issue is that they want to produce talkies right which are,0.49406108
movies that can talk which is normal for us now but not back then and,0.102333136
essentially what happens is they're freaking out because they can't have lena lamont in the,0.3669266
film because she's going to sound ridiculous right so what they do is they dub,0.70992213
the voice with somebody else kathy selden who is this young attractive lady that don,0.22245406
falls in love with and uh a lot of issues ensue particularly when liana lamont,0.103291206
finds out and she gets all mad and tries to stop it excuse me uh,0.37391213
but overall it's it's a fun little musical it really is and while it is,0.060358226
a good musical there are some issues i don't talk about one big issue right,0.062787294
now which was the long musical set says i stutter i apologize sequence at the,0.026613696
end of the film uh where we have this song it's like broadway rhythm i,0.07342901
think it's called um and boy is it long it was like literally like 20,0.07806876
minutes long and i'm sitting here like it has nothing at all to do with,0.19976284
the plot of the movie at all it really doesn't and it just kind of,0.06688469
felt weighed down by like oh well we already wrote the music so we got,0.09128252
to do it anyway so in another movie somehow and honestly it just it didn't,0.03312551
work very well i was prepared to give this a really good review and then,0.06365191
that scene and i just i i tried to let one scene ruin it but,0.25660998
it's a 20 minute scene like it's at least 10 minutes i might be over,0.095386155
exaggerating like it's 20 but it's at least like 10 minutes long and i'm like,0.09095327
we didn't need it and the music wasn't that good either that's another thing i,0.07299809
do want to talk about i don't really care for the music very much here,0.101683505
there's sometimes i love like make them laugh it's on my favorite songs or any,0.08790536
musical um and i do like good morning and singing in the rain is always,0.05480475
a good one but like the rest of it kind of felt meh and even,0.06866618
in the musical there's a lot of extra stuff like um what's wrong with me,0.07571789
which little lamont sings and a bunch of like that that i really enjoyed that,0.16368249
wasn't in the film um which is good because the film was pushing with that,0.04114061
20 minute long dance sequence i had nothing to do with the plot of the,0.06408724
film at all um but the acting was really strong here that's like one thing,0.0859739
that i really did like about the show was it is very well acted i'm,0.07800447
very impressed with with gene kelly here and of course um uh debbie reynolds and,0.089272186
gene hagen and donald o'connor all of them are great so let's go ahead and,0.52418274
start talking about them because i think they're definitely the the attraction that brings people,0.065592706
to see this movie gene kelly as don lockwood i've heard working with him is,0.17835283
is the worst thing you could ever do in your life um but to his,0.5148811
credit he's very good he really is um he's really good at singing but his,0.08569073
acting in particular is really really strong he plays this kind of an arrogant actor,0.5876557
who has started to realize that you know acting is kind of weird anyways maybe,0.2407777
maybe i shouldn't be as arrogant as i have been and like all that fun,0.55353683
jazz that ensues in the movie really just it was great i i did like,0.07626403
his portrayal in this movie uh and i haven't seen any of them i think,0.23997499
but maybe i'll look into looking at some other stuff maybe down the line we'll,0.08051247
do a you know a series of him i mean it is the 50s so,0.08213385
it was a long time ago but uh i do need to catch up on,0.08178879
some old film noir stuff donald o'connor as cosmo brown cosmos my favorite character i,0.09183982
am a little biased because i was young cosmo in the show but he's also,0.14525427
like he's really funny and he has that that make him laugh sequence that i,0.12960494
really like um it really is great he like broke his ankle or something doing,0.24193095
that and he had to do it like three times and he was he didn't,0.050986774
like it but he did it anyway because he was supposed to and honestly it,0.08158429
was really fun and i'm really happy they did the way they did it my,0.05589244
goal in life one day is to one day recreate that sequence um that'd be,0.0835977
a lot of fun like the exact sequence i think that'd be really really fun,0.06509052
debbie reynolds as kathy selden kathy selden is the young attractive girl that don falls,0.18967453
in love with and she can sing and she can act and all that stuff,0.10042168
but she's not on the big screen because she kind of thinks it's dumb but,0.794439
then she realizes oh it might actually be fun to do that so that she,0.1633427
does and that's really the romantic part of the movie and i liked it i,0.07666277
think it was good i think it was a good issue to have right where,0.07389394
don likes kathy but kathy doesn't really like dawn too much or at least she's,0.14180608
not letting on that she does and it works here because it's like one of,0.1245254
the first times that it ever happened right because you watch movies now and it's,0.07860751
like oh that's like every day but like this is like the first time like,0.08777733
it's one of the first times it's the 50s um but it worked well it,0.06505242
was it was a good excuse to have romance and i hate bad excuses from,0.3078407
that's like oh well it's a movie so it's gotta have a bunch of romance,0.14937012
in it right not necessarily it doesn't have to i got this director's chair okay,0.08305867
that's pretty cool um but like it's interesting that they did that because it was,0.06631804
like the first time like that's like basically an original idea right there think it,0.056487072
was really well done and i did like it quite a bit and we have,0.074930616
jean hagen as lena lamont lean on the monster great i hate her with a,0.8060606
passion don't get me wrong i hate her with a passion she's annoying as hell,0.7806553
to listen to she's like ow but donny you're in love and it's like oh,0.16557708
my god please he doesn't like you but she was great i really that's the,0.2425602
point of her characters to hate her so well done overall i think it's a,0.5571177
really really good movie i really do i think it's fun and it's it's it's,0.11579989
a good movie to watch and to pay attention to um for at least the,0.05546477
hour and 20 minutes and then of course it's like oh but here's a really,0.09065518
long dance number you get to listen to hee hee and it's like you just,0.16176379
could have not had that and it would have been great and i do have,0.067605
some issues with directing we're not going to talk about it because it's it's hard,0.10197635
to pinpoint what is directing what is acting at this point um and especially considering,0.061180413
gene kelly did both of them uh but there were just some issues that i'd,0.16793616
like all right take for example the singing of the rain dance that was really,0.05633117
well done right really really good and they had other things that just felt way,0.05080799
too structured right saying the rain felt like loose and gene kelly could just like,0.07986309
run around and dance and do awesome stuff with dance involved and then do other,0.06729111
things like say the good morning sequence which felt a little too over the top,0.050544415
for me even though it's a good song it's a little too over the top,0.06369296
for me um and of course the 20 minute long dancing because in the movie,0.061494924
which is so freaking long it's unbelievable um i can't express my hatred for that,0.54182637
sequence enough i was sitting here on my bed like watching this movie at like,0.2481753
10 at night and i'm like oh my goodness i just want to go to,0.053825658
sleep now like i was totally engaged in the movie and they're like oh but,0.14145459
this and i was like why um so that happened but overall a really really,0.083806925
fun movie if you guys want to give it a shot and take it take,0.27699584
a watch it's in it's on hbo max um and just be wary that towards,0.081885464
the end of the film it doesn't get a whole lot better the ending is,0.062711544
really fun i do like the ending after the sequence is really good um but,0.09967341
the sequence itself is not very good um but i'm gonna go ahead and give,0.15286018
singing in the rain an a minus really really fun movie it's a really old,0.15732557
