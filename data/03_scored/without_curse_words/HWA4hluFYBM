hello i am the movie maestro and welcome to this very special movie a lil,0.1085721
as the kampala come on the quality my voice I'm about to make you an,0.16424705
awfully attendant fields this movie is considered by many to be one of the greatest,0.1506515
movies ever made okay I'm not going to do this for the entirety of you,0.18627885
but as you can see I am back in my dark shadowy gritty environment where,0.10074039
I start off doing a vocal impression but in this case it's not going to,0.056847267
be about a horror movie it's going to be about what is essentially just a,0.12715062
dramatic study of a troubled family that happens to be involved in the world of,0.2404774
crime and it just so happens to be one of those movies that many people,0.29636946
consider to be one of the greatest films of all time the film was released,0.08315089
in 1972 under the direction of Francis Ford Coppola with a screenplay by Coppola and,0.04438947
Maria putzel and of course that movie is the godfather it's kind of hard to,0.38418305
pin down what to say exactly I'm going to film that many consider the greatest,0.15775213
of all time though I will say that personally I thought that it's well worth,0.0863799
the praise it's a fascinating study of people in a difficult situation where it just,0.07965769
happens to be part of their everyday lives and it's surprisingly well paced and the,0.07427624
characters are just so fascinating and even more fascinating still is the fact that it,0.03806835
could easily have been double slow and boring but really it's not especially if this,0.16075136
is the type of movie that many of you might be interested in the story,0.08149583
of the film centers around the Corleone family headed by Don Vito Corleone play by,0.016917668
Marlon Brando however the pivotal character of the film is his son Michael Corleone played,0.052412476
by Al Pacino and one of his first ever film roles and basically the stories,0.061807815
about all the trials and tribulations he goes through as he gradually comes to the,0.076613955
realization that it's his you see to take over his father's role as Godfather in,0.092652425
a family that lives a life crime helping people out and being serviceable and the,0.40339312
great thing about the swim in my opinion is that it's not really a glorification,0.08753531
of the mob or anything speaking against it really it's very very ambivalent in fact,0.07823266
having already seen a couple other films that do a similar thing this one certainly,0.08107381
masters it in almost every respect the characters are all very interesting they make the,0.04910885
film's deliberate pace seem much less deliberate due to that and all of them have,0.118769266
very legitimate virtues and flaws and they balance each other out very well in many,0.05276579
cases it's clear that not all of them are doing things that are good but,0.10030851
not all of them are doing things that are entirely terrible and oddly enough the,0.15812661
film's purpose isn't really to show will decide their own as mentioned before it's largely,0.117112726
ambivalent it's more an observation of a family and more specifically on the difficult acceptance,0.053822797
that a minute early must come to the character of Michael as he develops and,0.08959089
learns about the world he must get used to even though he'd much rather live,0.17265882
a more normal life with his wife played by Diane Keaton and certainly there are,0.14942491
many things about it that worked very well in that respect the atmosphere is also,0.052581597
great this is partial of course held widely superb acting particularly from Brando who in,0.10394488
spite of the fact that you can barely tell what he's even saying because of,0.15388097
his slurred speech still gets a lot across but in addition the atmosphere is well,0.08626734
provided by the very dark gritty cinematography that makes it difficult to focus on things,0.10221523
as well as nino rota's very haunting and very memorable musical score certainly these are,0.06710351
many things that deservedly got academy awards for this film in addition to the best,0.07593896
picture though of course this film is large infamous for Marlon Brando having turned down,0.30052814
his award refusing to accept it on grounds of making a statement for Native Americans,0.100659646
however in spite of that looking at the film on its own there's really too,0.0686944
much to talk about to really narrow it down to a concise review right here,0.10368055
but let me just say it is fascinating if i were to talk about what,0.0703359
makes it so fascinating this would go on for an eternity but let's just say,0.10452013
that there are lots of characters with interesting things to grasp i guess the one,0.07064315
flaw that i can point to this film is that there are maybe a couple,0.080321796
characters that could use a little bit more of an exploration but to be fair,0.052724592
they are particularly important figures in Michael's life and this is essentially Michael story so,0.054362547
I suppose I can forgive that and certainly I really admire the way it observes,0.08147816
the mob partially because the mob itself was very concerned about how this film would,0.124347195
be pulled off and therefore there were several members around to look over things and,0.08265973
another thing that I wished I saw more of though were the services to the,0.07361282
certain people the way the film opens is very bizarre and yet so effective it's,0.10140001
simply an interview from someone trying to make justice for the attempted rape of his,0.59849715
daughter and that it's revealed he is speaking to Don Corleone and the way it,0.10243934
shot is unbelievable it's a great way to open things off and the fact that,0.39285526
Marlon Brando's character Vito Corleone is willing to do services in spite of the situation,0.07562017
for many people in dire situations where nothing else can help is surprisingly touching it's,0.11418849
kind of hard to imagine that it would be but in fact it largely is,0.052759454
people praised the Godfather like crazy but really that praise is very very merited for,0.4033676
something that on the surface wouldn't seem interesting it's in fact a very very interesting,0.090945534
film and I really doubt that anybody wouldn't appreciate something out of it the acting,0.097366706
writing the pay sing the music the cinematography the atmosphere it's all very very well,0.06443445
done and to a very surprising degree Francis Ford Coppola of course became an overnight,0.14174555
sensation due to this film and well deserved he's made several other pretty well thought-out,0.15094742
films since maybe none that quite reached the level of this as well as its,0.08468539
popular sequel which I'm sure we'll get to later but for sure The Godfather is,0.03507794
well worth seeing on the worth meter this gets the distinction of an ultimate recommendation,0.103968024
whether you altima tlie will admire this film or not definitely check it out though,0.08983545
they're definitely going to be maybe a few things that you're likely to admire so,0.041529406
out of 5 stars this is a 5 out of 5 thank you for your,0.08372627
