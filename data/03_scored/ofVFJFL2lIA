to say had my concerns and gonna be completely honest here first trailer it was,0.07332219
a different style of animation and I was really trying to figure out what was,0.059561938
going on with it now seeing the final product oh my god the animation in,0.08902866
this movie it breaks all contradictions on 2d animation on 3d animation it is without,0.09334461
question the true definition of a living comic book there are so many things that,0.084775835
happen when you're watching this movie that is just amazing in the sense of animation,0.11629693
I know I'm gonna use a word amazing a lot and I'm sorry my spider-man,0.19381613
but it's not a pun it's just how I feel all the different ways that,0.067694664
the colors are popping out all the different ways the characters move around when words,0.08741275
pop up there's a couple of times watching this movie where I was like checking,0.09011766
my glasses cuz I'm like am I in a 3d movie right now I feel,0.13130154
like it because so many different layers and colors and things are popping out so,0.09271322
crazily that I thought I was in 3d it's hard to describe it you just,0.19364044
have to see it it is beyond anyone's belief of what they would have expected,0.056465894
out of animation with this movie I am not kidding with you right now on,0.16180192
the animation alone this movie deserves a Best Animated Oscar nomination hands down this movie,0.104440995
gets snubbed like lego movie did for best animation Oscar nomination I'm gonna be a,0.1498951
little upset because this movie does something with animation that we have not seen in,0.0808917
a feature-length animated film in quite some time some of you didn't watch cartoons on,0.08584368
TV may feel a little bit like okay this is a big-budget version of some,0.11294994
stuff I've seen on TV before but for most people this is gonna be like,0.06530927
whoa whoa are you trying to hate on Sony animators but I feel like the,0.26407203
B team worked on the other movies they're like oh you were real good anime,0.098277286
uh yeah we're gonna mo G ain't workin hotels resume yeah you you you get,0.10708179
over here resi I'll go work on that Popeye movie that we're never gonna put,0.09276012
out it is style and substance this is the origin story of Miles Morales as,0.06017527
spider-man it is so well done it was really cool I mean we've got a,0.15003736
lot of origin story movies about Peter Parker the movie itself even kind of jokes,0.094489336
about that a little bit so it was nice to see how they did miles,0.11907007
the story who he is as a character how he has a different background how,0.059182264
he is as a person how his family is you know all the different things,0.12786664
about him and what happens when he now has to take on the roles of,0.07781818
being spider-man or learning how to become spider-man what's nice about his character is that,0.112967886
he's not just a great character he's also a great avatar for us the audience,0.09786499
what would we do in this situation how will we fill in the situation miles,0.08927411
does that throughout the movie which is good because some crazy stuff happens in this,0.2407059
movie I'm not gonna go too much into it because I don't know how many,0.12420922
trailers you've seen but it is called spider-man into the spider verse so make your,0.10421066
assumptions as you will and I was worried that because of some of these outlandish,0.31089434
things that happens in this movie could that take away from the mild storyline and,0.06624199
what's nice about this movie is that it doesn't it always comes back to Myles,0.14248396
he is the the way to keep this craziness grounded and that's awesome they did,0.24091604
a really good job with that I'm glad that we were able to have some,0.059932563
fun with this some craziness with this and yet still be a great story about,0.30874586
Myles about his family about his becoming spider-man just all of it I almost don't,0.18889913
want to hype up too much this movie because I know as much as I,0.10183079
keep hyping this up you know you're gonna have that person to be like I,0.12865746
can't be that great and they're gonna go into the movie completely looking for nitpicks,0.11292062
so I'm sorry if I'm sounding a little bit overhyped but I can't stress enough,0.10376643
how much I love this movie and it is a Spider Man movie so expect,0.11742577
some spider-man references like a lot like a ton like on Lego Batman level of,0.27016795

on a character you get to play again with the animation with different styles you,0.06920616
get some 2d stuff some 3d stuff there are some times where it almost feels,0.05462597
kind of stop-motion like anime inspired Looney Toon slash classic Saturday morning cartoon inspired like,0.1748897
everything in some way gets represented both in spider-man and in animation that black panther,0.24085242
