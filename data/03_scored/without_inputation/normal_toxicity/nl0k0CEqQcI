hey everybody today I am going to be reviewing portrait of a lady on fire this film came out in 2019,0.41658968
it was written and directed by Celine,0.07253466
Dion sciama identifies very strongly as like a feminist artist and I think her movies really reflect that notion a bit she makes movies that tend to be about women movies that have to do with sexual identity and gender identity portrait of a lady on fire seems to be her most ambitious film particularly aesthetically and the film has received a lot of critical acclaim,0.17946224
and it's considered an artistic triumph for me though admittedly I I've struggled with my point of view on the film and I struggled with with how I was going to do this review I did have to see it twice,0.054252822
so that I kind of solidified my opinions a little bit but I am still torn because the filmmaker and her point of view to me there are things about her that I think are very nuanced and very interesting but then there are other aspects of her point of view that I think Mar the sophistication of the images and the ideas behind them,0.08638701
and when you really admire somebody artistically that you think has the ability to really go the full nine yards,0.10550836
it kind of it becomes frustrating,0.09990606
and it makes it all,0.055458784
the more frustrating that the film just wasn't quite doing it for me,0.09123344
I liked bits of it but as a whole it didn't come together for me and my feelings on it are a little muddled,0.16438489
I'm going to start talking about the things that I like about the film because I don't want to give people the impression that I like I hate this movie or anything like that no I'm just frustrated a little bit but I do think that the film touches on some very interesting ideas,0.15446149
and the premise itself is a wonderful setup used,0.051606283
as the catalyst to propel a love story,0.09530059
you have a protagonist at the center name is Mary Ann and she looks strikingly like Emma Watson like to a crazy degree at least,0.425808
that's what I thought,0.056512207
but her features are a little bit harder,0.35844886
she's a little bit harsher cheekbones and jawline and I think that that works really well for her character because her character is meant to be a very rebellious artist who is defying conventions,0.31506678
and you would consider her maybe a modern woman for the time that this takes place and this is her story,0.13705727
this is her retelling,0.15490182
the story about how she fell in love with her subject she is an artist,0.077134125
and she was paid to paint a wedding portrait of a woman that the woman's name is Elouise and she is very alluring great to turn a mysterious person who definitely rejects the idea of being married off to somebody that she doesn't know and sending a portrait to see if you know he approves and you know naturally that's understandable so while you're watching the film you can never really take it,0.16808951
at a literal level,0.05669124
you always have to look at it as though it's being seen through a distorted filter through the eyes of an unreliable narrator because the person telling the story is telling it from the point of view of somebody who was in in love it's like you know romance,0.07455281
so therefore it's going to be heightened and she is very creative and observant and all of those things are going to kind of bleed in to the imagery,0.15340747
the filmmaking really reflects this it's beautifully made film where it depends on its own minimalistic approach,0.10296478
as the crux of the the building tension throughout,0.047189727
especially the erotic tension building the relationship between these two women and this is done very effectively with very interesting camera shots,0.59320194
I really enjoy the scenes it's particularly when Eloise is introduced,0.12720019
and it's following her so her face is obscured all you can see are her eyes but she's elusive,0.25604635
and we are drawn to her because of the way she's framed we were drawn to her in the same ways that Marianne is drawn to her it uses a lot of empty space in the film but I think that it that creates the mood and it heightens the sexuality the film,0.175172
loves silence they love to take long pauses after a line is said and things like that,0.13469225
but yet at the same time even in the midst of those silences there's always that fire underneath both metaphorically and literally because often you see you know a fireplace in the distance and you can hear those those cracks and the snaps of the fire which you know creates again more of that erotic tension,0.25839323
the first half of the film kind of has a slow build to it,0.09068371
it really takes its time,0.0525125
but then the second half of the film it's kind of where everything's blossoming,0.07604659
it feels like everything is flourishing,0.07442571
and that's where a lot of the surrealism comes into play,0.067490794
and I like that I like that Marianne is the one telling the story because I think that that just adds another layer of complexity to it,0.05938655
it makes the ideas of love being heightened and distorted all of that a compelling thesis or at least one aspect of the thesis,0.06217728
yes there is that complicated nature of romantic love,0.11241485
and the immediacy of it being very visceral of course but then they add this whole nother idea where we're look at it through memory,0.14889106
the perceptions of memory especially sensory memory when you're recalling a love story,0.067730755
it's the sensory moments that you tend to remember the most and I think in the case of all kinds of love stories,0.051314533
we often choose the memories other than reality because it's easier we want to remember the person through our own filter through our own gaze because it gives us that sort of control,0.038117204
and that's also a really interesting idea that you can tie into the filmmaking process in general because it mirrors that filmmaking of course is a manipulative tool as I always say,0.11613258
and its own right,0.069307
I actually wish that that point had been brought into play more I think that would have been very interesting,0.054835305
and I sort of like Mulholland Drive sense there are images in this film that reminded me a lot of mahon Drive especially you know the profile shots where they're kind of overlapping in the beginning of the film Aloise refuses to pose for the portrait,0.083356604
so her mother tells Marian,0.20451425
well could you just,0.06763505
maybe do it in secret,0.076230824
so basically what Marian's having to do is she's having to paint her just from memory and let me tell you that's ridiculously hard to do I'm an artist myself and I don't I don't think I could do that I have to have a subject,0.2940168
I have to have a reference point to make it seem realistic with shadows,0.07501959
and the way that the light is hitting the face,0.4325819
and all of that is very difficult to recreate on your own,0.17936458
it is a skill that I wish that I had so props to Mary Ann that skill works in the film because it's essential to the whole idea of what it means to perceive a person,0.08529189
the memory,0.062114783
of a person as your feelings are changing for them compared to the reality and how they would be if they were there in front of you and that really can't affect your creative sensibilities,0.058225065
and I think Mary Ann you know she's becoming inspired artistically as the film is going,0.07710459
so that point of view is reflected through the film as I said it becomes more surrealistic and more kind of beautiful and flourish as it goes art for her is a business,0.11276707
she's there to do a job but at the same time she's finding new ways to be inspired and to improve through her relationship with the subject but in love,0.060824618
it's never about just one person,0.14928241
I mean even in a love story,0.06841632
if one person is deeply in love with somebody who doesn't have the same feelings back it's still going to affect both of them very deeply typically,0.0895017
it's not just about the subject it's how you see the subject and how you are translating and that's a very personal thing,0.06860525
I think and even somebody who does realistic portraits I'm as Merion does there's a vulnerability to that,0.095012896
and there's always a piece of the artistic thing in the artwork especially as you grow older,0.23830417
there's a moment that captured that for me pretty early on it's when she puts on Mary Ann,0.08340445
she puts on the green dress that Eloise is supposed to be wearing when she poses for the portrait,0.1351387
and because I Louise is not there in the beginning of the film she puts it on and has a mirror and she kind of sits in place just kind of,0.06964773
so there's a body there's a figure to work off of but also there's a deeper idea to that,0.0701805
it's the idea of the artist merging with their subject or their art on a less literal level and how that's going to build through the film,0.083831
and it's since through these moments she's discovering herself and she's growing as an artist until she finally in the end of the film she draws herself she draws a portrait of herself but she's not doing it for a business,0.15028116
she's not doing it for herself,0.26516697
um,0.012811388
she's doing it for someone else,0.12402928
she's doing it for Eloise,0.14909884
that's the moment when we realized that she's made her full evolution her full arc as a character and her individuality has shifted as a result artists,0.15343007
and muses is the story here but as I mentioned before there's always a mirroring of that in terms of the filmmaking process and you can also look at this on a more subtextual sense,0.05436139
you know there is muse and filmmaker because I know that in real life and I didn't know this until you know after seeing the movie that the the director did date to the actress who played Eloise for many years they were together,0.060637493
and I know that they are pretty sure they broke up prior to making the film but even so there is a there is you know something there,0.059331227
and even before knowing this information just the way that Eloise is framed in the film you can tell that the filmmaker is enamored with her,0.062100537
she's capturing that elusive muse in a very hypnotic way,0.1550984
and therefore we are hypnotized as well and I really think that Adele had now I think that's how you pronounce her name um,0.14806268
I think she's wonderful in the film she gives by far the best performance for me,0.08392237
she has a hardness to her but there is a sensuality and a playfulness as well in her eyes and just very very striking,0.32315138
there are images in the film that are just so stunning,0.10782836
especially when you have that beautiful French backdrop there are a lot of images that stuck out I love the ones with three ladies and you know you see their silhouettes as they're walking,0.09689476
and that in the backdrop is that gorgeous fiery sunset the image of Eloise in the darkness and she's there's a long shot of her as her dress catches on fire,0.30790898
that is another one that is very,0.056512758
forgot very dynamic sciama is very minimalistic,0.12864211
but there is kind of a impressionistic approach almost though it looks like a painting,0.08631205
there are many intimate moments in the film off and my favorite parts are the parts where characters are alone and nothing is being said or just specific moments between the two women where they're very simple,0.12627634
there are no pretenses,0.10385096
it's just a love story,0.041491885
it's the moments person you can tell some it,0.07320974
isn't really trying to evoke something those are the moments that really stick out to me as the most strong and the most the most human however that kind of segues into a lot of things that I don't like about the film even though there are some gorgeous images in the film and it's beautifully composed and and on all of that I think that you know even if you have an amazing artistic is how it clearly does I think you have it's important as a viewer or at least as a critic,0.100431286
I should say it's important not to be just so intoxicated by the way something is designed and structured especially when something is so aesthetically driven you have to be careful of that for me,0.14323586
I like to be also very home care of the filmmakers point of view and what they're trying to say and and not being so intoxicated by the rest and when I look at it from that point of view it doesn't affect me as much and I find myself realizing that there are moments that stick out to me and that I remember and that I'm pleased by when I think back on it but as a whole the film doesn't mean that much for me,0.07403075
I found myself wishing that the story itself had more of that complexity,0.059424806
so that it matched the richness of those images that the beauty of those images that Salma is is working so hard to create I don't mean to say that the film does not have passion behind it because I think it does I do think it comes from a vulnerable place coming from a place of having a break up and moving on and that's mirrored through the story for sure,0.05381047
but I you know,0.03688455
so I don't think that the intent is disingenuous,0.1425663
it's it's more,0.060613044
I don't think that sciama quite has the confidence and the awareness yet as an artist to be able to to work on that next level,0.06650872
because as it stands it does feel kind of already and very lofty,0.051897306
and I think that our house filmmaking when it's done really well it's exploring all sorts of aspects of art,0.06058632
and how it is tied to the human condition in a truly vulnerable way,0.114815295
well a lot of the images are very symbolic,0.059049875
I think that they're too conscious of their symbolism in a way that just kind of it puts me off a little bit and I just don't think that the that Choma is quite trusting in the spontaneity of the moment and the integrity of the core story,0.124584414
yes I know that,0.049449697
it's meant to be kind of artistically heightened and distorted,0.11021761
but there's something about it that does feel staged in a way that is you know that I don't think Sam is quite conscious of and it doesn't give the film true fluidity,0.069368646
so I always felt a little bit removed from it,0.19015446
I couldn't help but think about persona directed by Ingmar Bergman while watching this film just because there are so many similarities between the two films you know you have two women in that film also in a house very secluded from everybody else,0.12670414
and they're very few cast members in the rest of the film it also relies on silence and emptiness and beautiful images and similar ways yet persona to me excels in all the areas where this one does not it's about morality in a way that really cuts deeper and it's much more multi-layered and it doesn't seem to be so concerned with political statements,0.08902648
it's simply just that aspect of it is just simply a part of the tapestry and part of exploring the psyche,0.06451569
so emma has been very vocal as an artist about how she does want to employ politics into the film which is fine,0.11711964
I mean,0.07710842
there's typically going to be a political point of view whether you're conscious of it or not because of the society that we live in you know when you're making when you're writing a story as an artist,0.15795195
but I think if you're gonna do it really consciously,0.08823339
it's a tricky thing for it to not come off as a contrivance because when that happens that it loses its authenticity,0.15475935
there are times,0.03743607
when that aspect of things is very pointed,0.0813112
and and not in some crazy overt way where they're just rubbing,0.4578377
it in your face constantly but enough for me to feel that it cheapens the overall effect of the film and the meaning of it they talk about equality as a pleasing feeling but it doesn't feel that equal to me it just seems like they're kind of dismissing males and as not allowing women to do this or that and that feels trite and not particularly well written to the story it loses its sincerity to the thinness of those conceits,0.31089434
and while I don't want to use the word propaganda because that's way too strong of a word,0.06737461
I think it does exist,0.18705659
especially when you look at there's another character in the film a young maid,0.07118544
it's like a subplot young girl where she's getting an abortion,0.6506345
and you know that's fine,0.0692131
you know whatever,0.11139923
I think it's fine to make a movie about that,0.07766472
but it just it doesn't feel like it works,0.0644733
it feels very disjointed like something that was inserted like a you know I got a feminist agenda and it didn't really contribute to the overall story for me in a way that felt cohesive maybe sciama,0.40539387
I think sees the world in quite an extraordinary way,0.10455434
but I I want more confidence in there to where she can trust in just what she feels in her soul and bringing that out so we can fill all those empty spaces,0.15698376
and that those silences to truly ripen to levels where it doesn't have to rely on on socio politics in a way that feels kind of uninspired at times and I really don't like to talk about politics trust me it's not something that I I uses the focal point of my reviews often but when you have a director who is very vocal about that and who does see her film as political,0.10325916
and as a feminist work then you know I kind of have to break that apart much to my chagrin and I like to think of it in the sense of like what if you had a male director who only had males working on his set and it was an all-male cast for the most part,0.19508
and they only talked about women in passing in that way I definitely don't think that would go over well in the liberal arts scene you need to always think about that,0.15075733
and is this feminism that you are using as part of your thesis is it really a tool,0.36184987
for equality or is it more there to defy convention,0.12211692
and I think in this case it seems to be more that second one not on like a completely rudimentary level,0.149075
but just there enough where it to kind of annoy me and I think she's better than that so yes a little muddled still not quite sure what I think about it to be quite honest with you I all I know is that there were moments that connected with me,0.15053682
but just overall,0.035463396
I didn't feel it,0.06468068
in the way that a lot of people have,0.05441769
and a lot of people have spoken to me,0.050734255
so highly about this film the artistry of the film just feels a little bit on the nose for me and not in the ways I think that sama really intended for it to be at least for me,0.07851536
and you know when I look at her,0.12771288
and when I look at this movie it looks like something that a very very talented and precocious art student may just after they got out of art college or whatever and so yes if it's very impressive and there's like you know I'm interested to see what they do next for sure,0.0895764
but at the same time it's it is a little arty,0.07836193
it is a little embellished and it's lacking that sophistication in that maturity,0.19486484
so a lot of the the thematic elements especially the political ones and all of that they aren't into woven very well but she does have a gift for sure,0.13219911
and I want to make that point,0.08303315
I don't want people again I don't want people thinking that I I hate this film or anything like that,0.39699423
because I do think that the pieces are there I just want them to come together narrative ly aesthetically all the way and I am interested to see what she does next because I think that she could just slowly get there,0.33487725
and if she can get there,0.048370585
I think she does have a masterpiece Center,0.054254416
I don't know,0.1431935
I don't know if I want to recommend this or not,0.12671018
I think it's an interesting discussion to have,0.055297602
and I think that if you're really into films that are aesthetically driven you're going to love this film,0.1771501
so in that sense,0.06903827
I think I would recommend it,0.069013305
but yeah that is my review,0.07840095
I guess,0.05009925
