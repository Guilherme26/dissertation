so at Disney press screenings they take your phone they don't trust us every other,0.10146315
studio lets you keep your phone I mean they have security in the room watching,0.09007357
you you know those little devices to see if anyone's recording but Disney makes you,0.07660485
hand over every electronic device and they wand you going in to make sure you,0.23667221
hand it in and you have to put it in a little plastic baggie and,0.40315333
you get a little you know baggage claim ticket and you have to pick it,0.13937955
up after the screening and let me tell you the line is long but because,0.04645297
they do that and you have to get there early to make sure you get,0.053116787
a good seat there are no reserved seats at these press screenings so I decided,0.066389464
this time to bring some reading material and I brought the Time magazine that recently,0.030772122
came out with chadwick boseman on the front of it talking about this very movie,0.0936807
and you know what it ended up being the perfect choice because black panther plays,0.31089434
more like Time magazine than a comic book I was very surprised now it works,0.08004609
and a lot but it's different so allow me to explain first off it is,0.038472716
extremely political but I appreciated the political comments it had to make I think that,0.07042681
in the run-up to this film's release they've been made to see much more incendiary,0.07099941
than they are and they're not you know you know they've they've been made to,0.10001214
see more Malcolm X and I think they're very much Martin Luther King jr. side,0.12533753
note if you haven't seen Selma you should see it Ava Duvernay was so good,0.11663768
directing that movie she's almost got this one and she and Ryan Coogler are super,0.2375908
close he talked about editing across the hall from her a wrinkle in time you,0.070672445
know her editing as well and I hope you know we'll see if that movie,0.11410308
turns out just as political but anyway there's also a National Geographic element to this,0.10370265
film and it's exploration of Wakanda its history and its traditions and you know I,0.05128243
have to say it's it's odd to me and you know I'm not gonna go,0.105056815
into spoiler territory so don't worry about it but I have to say that it,0.09241095
was odd that a civilization was such filled ristic technology like it it almost seemed,0.11312014
made-up haha it was made up of course but you know it was amazing but,0.06339282
I don't understand how they would be so primitive in their leadership structure and board,0.3220688
that come to bite them in the butt we'll discuss in the spoiler review I,0.8606264
also have to add that for all the wonderful dynamic female characters that are featured,0.06321435
in the movie and they've made a big deal about that at the end of,0.0502946
the day they're all still support staff which also comes from tribal culture and I,0.0545251
don't think that's a great idea either so but anyway we'll discuss all that in,0.09244738
a spoiler review but well it's politics in its world-building are impressive and admirable you,0.11038613
know what I actually have to say it reminded me of a fascinating follow-up to,0.058591112
roots and that's hard for me to say because obviously as I've discussed before I'm,0.1471511
not a member of the black community I'm an outsider looking in but that's what,0.44609427
I felt when I was watching the movie as the next touchstone in the journey,0.08655927
of defining the black community its sense of self and also I think you know,0.36755294
for anyone like myself watching this material how its seen and the fact that a,0.06700682
comic book movie can achieve that is incredibly noteworthy very very impressive and again while,0.10213731
that is all impressive though the movie doesn't have nearly enough action I was surprised,0.049947392
how little action it has I can't believe that no one brought that up to,0.07728025
Ryan Coogler and said you know this is all really fascinating you're really making me,0.14928597
think and I think you're doing a lot for the world with this movie but,0.12534517
it's also comic-book movie and we promise people a lot of action in the trailers,0.0930639
so maybe you should consider delivering it it has two extended action sequences and they,0.08222135
both go by way too quickly made all the more frustrating by the fact that,0.09808017
when they click they really click there were a couple of moments in this movie,0.07477865
where my it took my breath away and most of them we're doing the action,0.15487608
sequences but some of the wort and again that's mighty impressive now as a comic,0.10866404
book movie I would put Black Panther on the same level as the first x-men,0.19037347
movie and also Batman Begins where a very talented filmmaker was still getting the hang,0.096075594
of not just VFX work but working at this level I would say to the,0.08261393
movie I would say almost never felt like a big shiny blockbuster it it often,0.093805715
felt like a small movie like the films that Ryan Coogler has been making and,0.11000943
I would say that the Russo brothers are still the best in the biz this,0.10158995
when it comes to not only doing action sequences but realizing their importance you know,0.09514674
it's like what that story that Steven Soderbergh story that they they really should teach,0.24728398
it in film school and they should may put it on every film set where,0.08109182
he said I was at an airport and I saw someone in our target demographic,0.058766417
just fast-forwarding through a big blockbuster movie just to watch the action sequences and some,0.054973718
people that's the way they consume the material I think we're all consumer the material,0.14947554
that way sometimes there's nothing wrong with that Steven Soderbergh thought there was but the,0.16969019
Russo brothers understand that's how a lot of this stuff is consumed and they build,0.15305756
their movies accordingly Ryan Coogler has yet to learn that lesson and because of the,0.16664404
lack of action I worry about this movie's repeat watch ability factor especially to those,0.081528075
it doesn't resonate with culturally another problem in terms of rewatch ability is that the,0.06004936
film exists in a bubble it has nothing to do with the MCU at large,0.050248068
that doesn't mean it's not entertaining but I just don't want you to go and,0.09212717
disappointed alright so next the music with all due respect to Kendrick Lamar's album Ludwig,0.09276321
Gordon his score does a lot to make this movie but frustratingly like the action,0.09771039
the music comes and goes too quickly I'd be like oh this is so good,0.06839696
why did you stop playing it I want more of it I'm definitely buying the,0.13899773
score as it was both tribal and modern at the same time like Wakanda itself,0.14299628
oh well Conda much like Pandora many people who see this movie say they would,0.087666966
like to go there and don't worry just like with Pandora Disney will be happy,0.06700705
to oblige very soon at one of their theme parks and they should I would,0.08334711
definitely want to go there and on that note Wakanda felt like two things and,0.051852785
the other one though was like a real place but what was a theme park,0.081374854
which again I would very much like to visit while I was watching the movie,0.06971252
it I almost was like where can I have my my brick my character breakfast,0.18972188
and where's the Black Panther ride and what time is the stage show start it,0.24157703
was really cool but the other thing that it felt like and this is far,0.04190174
more important obviously is it felt like an idea now at one point in the,0.06180279
film it's referred to as a fantasy which was quite touching but even better it,0.22646783
was also established in the film as aspirational and that is Black Panthers biggest gift,0.00023484524
to the world hopefully redefining how the black community sees itself all not redefining of,0.60507727
I think that's a much better word evolving how the black community sees itself because,0.48892295
it's very much has one foot in the past and also how others see the,0.06275259
black community and I think that's really noteworthy and remarkable and I'd have given Ryan,0.49503857
Coogler another hour to explore this make it a three hour movie I wonder if,0.055533253
I would gladly watch it another hour of this but he'd have to promise me,0.12748584
the 20 of those 60 minutes would be more action now that acting is top,0.110150255
notch across the board and all the characters are incredibly charismatic likeable and complex I,0.08145071
also was blown away by the strength of the relationships portrayed and a lot of,0.063416086
that is accomplished by the actors and I was particularly impressed with the brother-sister bond,0.101754665
between T'Challa and Sheree very unusual to see inmates true entertainment for any group I,0.06576299
just thought that was really nice as someone who has a very close relationship with,0.11588716
my own sister so I really like that a lot now without spoilers my favorites,0.16526942
are chadwick boseman of course it's his movie but in a very understated way with,0.113881566
tisha Wright in a very understated way I love her mind and I love her,0.15498817
fashions I would love to raid her closet she looked fantastic she I think she,0.6332849
doesn't have any thumb holes but it's in the thumb hole category we would get,0.15147229
along Danai gurira Wow totally see why she got upgraded to infinity war she was,0.12444303
one of the moments that took my breath away in the casino you know what,0.08597822
what you see it because you'll probably have your breath taken away Winston Duke what,0.3262475
a scene stealer and then Andy Serkis having so much fun it's criminal now as,0.4173288
for Martin Freeman also a warning he has a very small role it's almost non-existent,0.15337075
but I thought there was some poetic justice in it after having after having to,0.04196061
see poor Jeffrey Wright basically run through Bond movies the last couple of Bond films,0.28029746
now I would not see this movie in 3d the press screening was in 2d,0.08462028
and it looked great and if the studio doesn't show it in 3d that means,0.06135108
they know it shouldnít does not need to be seen that way for instance guardians,0.079029866
of the galaxy vol 2 was shown to the press in 3d and it was,0.058024853
remarkable this 2d all the way there are also two end credits scenes but they,0.053846758
are very low-key I mean they're nice and enjoyable but they're not like that's not,0.1506068
one of the things take your breath away Oh Inc inclusion just like everyone should,0.16830671
see roots everyone should see Black Panther I honestly feel it's that important and as,0.16820829
for its place in the MCU and as a comic book movie just from an,0.06585412
entertainment perspective the stage is now beautifully set and they should greenlight of sequel immediately,0.11440839
I mean I guess they're waiting to see how it does opening weekend on the,0.062496047
strength of this and the strength of the hype if I were Kevin Feige I,0.039598178
already would have greenlit a sequel especially seeing that the film canal with its sequel,0.3367519
hit the ground running and have more action gotta have more action you know whenever,0.19585937
I whenever I wrote a comic book called superbia and at the top of my,0.1330847
outline I'd always put sex violence in action and I'd be like does it have,0.6903075
enough of these three things and you know they should they would move them to,0.060797725
apply the same strategy to this fell to the sequel in all movies quite frankly,0.15101121
but anyway that's my review black panther I look forward to hearing your thoughts down,0.3437883
below but no spoilers save those for the spoiler review I really appreciate action you,0.09444196
know in all honesty talking about this movie with you it's a very important and,0.12100532
tricky film to discuss as we've been discussing this week and so I'm really honestly,0.09771882
you know I always look forward to discussing movies with you down below but with,0.34806013
this one I am honored to partake in the discussion of something I know is,0.04772775
so important to a group that I'm not a part of alright so anyway I,0.09487144
loved it write your thoughts down below and you can check out some more videos,0.2455847
