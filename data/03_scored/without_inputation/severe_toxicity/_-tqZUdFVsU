what is up guys Stu here so this week I was lucky enough to get,0.06109845
my booty over to a very advanced screening of a film which I was incredibly,0.2516157
excited for it's been released over across the pond in the States for a little,0.027963655
while now and it's doing great over there doesn't actually come out over here in,0.028496467
the UK until mid February next year but I got myself over to the screening,0.023531538
of it that film was moonlight so that's all about that so moonlights directed by,0.033644322
Barry Jenkins it's basically telling the story of this kid called Tyrone and we see,0.033543214
him in three stages of his life and the fact that we see him as,0.07253628
a kid nicknamed little as he's trying to deal with growing up in a troubled,0.072018765
environment you know his mum's a crack addict he doesn't really have a father figure,0.32812366
in his life let me go through to the second up we see him as,0.092434585
a young man in school and he's dealing with sort of discovering himself and his,0.041403025
place in the world in that sense before we move through into the final act,0.100853816
were seen as a full grown man and adult so sort of like a coming-of-age,0.024295833
film told over three parts as we sort of see this main character's life in,0.021352395
these three stages and you guys know coming-of-age films are one of my favorite genres,0.050202075
or films I love a good coming of age film that's I was excited for,0.037032105
this one and it did not disappoint at all this film absolutely blew me away,0.13348706
I love basically everything about it I'm fully expecting it to rake in all the,0.066540316
awards ever it's just so good so phone's got a really great cast of people,0.04968589
we've seen before mixed in with a bunch of newcomers who I've not seen acting,0.035686437
anything before and they were just fantastic across the board I mean the serratus we,0.067143634
played shyrone in the respective parts of his life that we're seeing in each act,0.04559435
just did a fantastic job I mean we're lucky enough to get a Q&A with,0.01921649
the director Barry Jenkins afterwards in which he explained that the three actors playing the,0.03480773
central character never actually met or kind of discussed the character with each other they,0.003335896
just sort of did it in their own ways and I mean it's a really,0.040063344
interesting character to see performed by three different people because they each bring their own,0.014897453
different things to it but there are also really interesting things that are similar throughout,0.010907682
all their performances which are unintentional or perhaps are intentional but which weren't actually discussed,0.051156614
between the actors playing the character which means that we do get a very kind,0.06683765
of interestingly well-rounded character to look at doesn't feel like we're watching three different actors,0.022489859
giving a different interpretation of a character it feels like we're just watching a progression,0.015694343
of one character which is exactly what you need in the performances they give are,0.019726686
my favorite part of this film particularly Trayvon Rhodes who plays black or sort of,0.06618178
the old adult version of genre and as we see him in the film I,0.030392906
think he does a fantastic job is the way he uses silences and the tension,0.05090052
in his face in certain scenes in the final acts is just stunning to watch,0.11088279
I think he blew it out of the park he was amazing but alongside the,0.072743155
guys playing showroom we've got other actors who as I said I'm all recognizable such,0.05508918
as Naomi Harris playing his mom in the film and Naomi Harris gives the best,0.041306574
performance I've seen from Naomi Harris yeah she's just fantastic in the film completely unrecognizable,0.069719225
to a certain point again with the chance to chat to her and Brad Jenkins,0.028173188
in the Q&A afterwards it turns out she was only on set for three days,0.01791539
on this film because a scheduling conflicts with Spector and sorting out visa problems with,0.035808165
her working in the States but three days she was on this film for three,0.018589223
days and gives all the best female performances I've seen all year but also Muhammad,0.07990785
Ali is in the film as well okay Remmy from house of cards if that's,0.024922436
where you know him from that's where I know him from I just that's all,0.016906308
I see is but he's fantastic in his own way as well everyone on the,0.048416056
cast side of things giving great performances here that really do help suck you into,0.43913907
a world which feels incredibly real and authentic and that sounds of the performances being,0.01907414
so great but it's also down to the incredible direction from Mary Jenkins I've not,0.030567184
seen any of his work before this but oh my god did this guy blow,0.23433913
me away there's just so much about this film from a directing standpoint which completely,0.05069431
took me off guard and really floored me that's not being a sort of fluidity,0.061071176
and a movement in the direction of this film it's a film which could get,0.042705454
a little bit dizzying to some there's a little bit of shaky-cam here and there,0.03791414
but I already loved his decision to move to a more kinetic style of filmmaking,0.03283679
as opposed to the usual sort of over-the-shoulder style of dialogue the way he moves,0.031600215
his camera around different characters in each scene is really wonderful to watch and there,0.026466992
are certain moments between characters which are just fantastically directed particularly just everything in the,0.013528505
final act of this film there's also a couple of moments between Shiro and his,0.048600312
mother which are just fantastically elevated by the direction for Mary Jenkins but he also,0.06837556
helped write the film as well he helped on the screenplay side of things which,0.014479052
is another reason I love this film the dialogue between characters which I say he's,0.037337422
the lack of dialogue between characters and certain scenes were just beautiful to watch the,0.031086693
main character of shyrone is that character that really doesn't say a huge amount instead,0.025433296
we understand a lot about his character and what he's going through for a lot,0.023983195
of his facial expressions his emotions which are seen through his eyes and just the,0.11055751
way he kind of navigates the world it's not really so much about the dialogue,0.061412416
as much as it is about the silence and what we can see in things,0.061182927
he isn't saying which can sound a little bit pretentious to say sometimes but it,0.0454653
is clearly an intention of beara Jenkins to get that across through this film there's,0.039166015
one particular and I think it's a very final scene of the film which just,0.022216469
blew me away just there's just a very long shot of a certain characters face,0.26133695
in the moment and you just completely understand what he's going through and see exactly,0.017750425
what his emotions are in that point without him saying a single word cinema like,0.025380747
that and filmmakers that can get such subtle emotions across without saying anything are just,0.020661935
amazing in my books it also allows for really interesting moments from a score and,0.036587097
soundtrack perspective because the Saturn in this film really is beautiful as well it's an,0.059807327
incredible juxtaposition of the sort of harsh hood reality that we're seeing in the film,0.026776968
lining up against a lot of classical music again something to Barry Jenkins said in,0.046541568
Q&A was that it was a clear intention of his to use a soundtrack which,0.024855252
you wouldn't necessarily assume would go with a film like this at least in the,0.01541164
past of cinema seeing a little stories about black neighborhoods or a story like this,0.105224736
has been a tendency to go towards sort of the more kind of urban hip-hop,0.05084797
style of things and getting in a load of tracks in that sense but I,0.044921182
really admired the use of classical music here to juxtapose that let me say this,0.050144203
being played is just stunning to listen to as well how does he can't really,0.026618654
think of a lot wrong with this film I was expecting it to be good,0.07055403
I wasn't expecting to be blown away quite as much as I was genuinely a,0.06632679
very stunning film here a story which deals with stuff and gives a different look,0.03341417
on things and we would usually get in traditional cinema and I appreciate that as,0.022922894
well just seeing a story which is so refreshingly done it's just wonderful to see,0.023612024
I love this film I haven't been able to stop thinking about ever since I,0.09210798
saw it and I cannot wait to see it again it's just a shame I,0.07816773
gotta wait three months I I don't want to do that so I'm gonna go,0.046604097
ahead and give moonlight a very well-deserved five stars it is simply stunning the level,0.031320173
of filmmaking on display here is just beautiful but what about you guys what do,0.05896321
you think of moonlight have you seen it already I know it's already out in,0.035764262
the States and has been for a little while so if you're over there and,0.05128034
you've seen it let me know what you thought in the comments below if like,0.029715749
me you live over here in gray rainy Britain then you probably gotta wait until,0.0353146
February but you may have got a chance to see it early like me if,0.019971473
you have let me know in comments below I'd love to know and as you've,0.050729565
