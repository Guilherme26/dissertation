actual month of October is just this great time where everyone else thinks it's Halloween,0.060622886
knives out was written and directed by Rian Johnson and stars everyone this movie is,0.15719487
filled with so many incredible actors namely Daniel Craig Chris Evans Jamie Lee Curtis easily,0.09513236
one of the best cast of the year in an old-fashioned whodunit it's a murder,0.4042706
mystery all about the death of a patriarch of a very eccentric and combative family,0.3240018
Daniel Craig plays the equally eccentric detective who's investigating and everyone else is a suspect,0.19877937
murder mysteries are very successful on TV but you don't see as many of them,0.28674278
in film my mom has always loved the Miss Marple show and Murder She Wrote,0.72499603
and all of those shows you know that like people like to gather around the,0.07174855
TV and watch and try to figure out who did it you don't get as,0.08757865
many of that in film last year we had the remake of the Murder on,0.11704203
the Orient Express and the best of the bunch in my opinion clue which stars,0.07540861
Tim Curry who is a perfect and flawless human being and there's the Sherlock Holmes,0.15445045
movies with Robert Downey jr. but even those are based off of a very popular,0.07488571
character in literature it's been a while since we've had an original murder mystery that,0.13552316
isn't based off of something else brand new characters brand new story Rian Johnson is,0.0500369
a really good director for this type of film brick is in a way the,0.08497336
tech t'v story as well and it's probably still my favorite of his films but,0.115927495
this one got really close this is an ingenious film extremely well-written filled with charismatic,0.17704196
characters and actors giving some of their best performances Daniel Craig holy this is a,0.060349107
performance this is like super over the top with an insane accent and I loved,0.2426453
every minute of it he owns this whole movie he has this crazy Southern drawl,0.49401712
and when he first started talking I actually sat back a little bit in my,0.09898586
seat blown away by hearing that voice come out of that man and I wondered,0.25294405
is this working for me and like 10 seconds later I was like oh yeah,0.12305779
oh mmm that's working for me jokes aside I loved him here sometimes you get,0.13743693
performances that are really over-the-top like this one and there will be some people who,0.058398727
think he's really hamming it up for some reason even though it's incredibly obvious that,0.1750382
he's doing it on purpose this is a very tongue-in-cheek performance that is almost winking,0.15358847

I apologize if I said her name incorrectly she's really great here as well I've,0.09951764
seen her pop up in a lot of movies obviously Blade Runner 2049 she's been,0.07116427
doing a lot of things lately but she gets a big role in this movie,0.12683827
front and center and she's excellent however there is one shot in this movie where,0.26220196
an actor gave what I imagine must have been his most difficult performance to date,0.08714766
Chris Evans has a shot where he has to pretend like he doesn't like dogs,0.37185356
it must have been horrible for him I joke but he really was great in,0.259401
the film as well there's not a weak link in this entire cast everyone brought,0.068659306
their a-game and they're also reading dialogue that's witty clever and intelligent that constantly pits,0.25516245
its characters and conflicting situations that raises the tension in every scene and Johnson had,0.041627567
a difficult job with this movie because it's a comedy with suspense you want your,0.2085481
audience to laugh when you want them to laugh but you don't want to release,0.10533771
them from tension so much that they don't feel tense when you want them to,0.10520087
and he found a great balance between those and just about every scene for instance,0.054926258
Daniel Craig's character comes on very strong at first and you're like wow this is,0.05575447
really entertaining and weird and it's just bizarre but then there's a scene later on,0.10233424
where he's sort of leaning back in the shadows smoking a cigar and you just,0.13628058
see that cigar tip light up in the dark and you're like ooh that guy's,0.15500318
hiding something so he keeps his characters mysterious even when it seems like they're being,0.07822014
their full selves in front of everyone now I don't want to get into any,0.15501067
spoilers of course because the movies not gonna come out for another week but the,0.06144824
film has a really unique take on the whodunit in regards to what information it,0.09754704
lets you know early on a lot more than you would expect to know early,0.05920754
on for these types of movies and it sort of makes you rethink how you,0.061134886
process a whodunit because you usually go into one of these thinking all right well,0.15419693
let's try to figure out which one of these bastards did the thing but this,0.8785311
movie is kind of like well here's some info and because of that you're second-guessing,0.14894979
yourself throughout the entire movie as for issues I don't really have that many I,0.103849135
think this is a good time with the movies and it's just the type of,0.063941225
movie it should have been but there are some characters in the movie that are,0.049967874
a bit throwaway they're there as a one-note joke of sorts that have maybe three,0.17751409
to four lines in the entire movie there's a young character in the movie that,0.05270581
is glued to the phone for the majority of the film and he's the butt,0.79834265
of many jokes but he doesn't have the chance to actually be a character really,0.07522426
he's just kind of there to be laughed at and that's okay I mean that,0.17617682
happens a lot in movies it's just that this movie is so smart and so,0.11864412
clever that that felt a bit disposable to me that you had this opportunity and,0.31596184
he didn't really do anything with it it was just like a one joke character,0.16463862
and there's also a few scenes where the characters have to leave the house and,0.080316454
engage in things outside and it's never as claustrophobic or as suspenseful as when they're,0.1102733
all trapped there it's not that the outside scenes are necessarily bad it's just that,0.10713148
they're not as entertaining as the scenes at the house knives out is exactly the,0.15665056
film I wanted it to be this is really in his wheelhouse and I think,0.12981226
he knocked it out of the park I'm gonna give knives out and a -,0.41846594
