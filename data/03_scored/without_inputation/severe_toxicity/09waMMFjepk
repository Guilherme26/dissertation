debut 8th grade oh now 8th grade is a film that's kind of hard to,0.0444489
summarize because it's really about the network of things that go on in the film,0.03605628
essentially though the movie follows Kayla day in her final week up eighth grade she,0.04934465

something more such a quick plot synopsis really doesn't do this justice it might make,0.034664717
you just kind of roll your eyes and go okay well not another melodramatic coming-of-age,0.33332705
film but this movie is anything but that it is a really impressive directorial debut,0.03512236
from Bo Burnham it's kind of a set of wandering episodes or experiences across Kayla's,0.03071419
final week of middle school and as you watch these episodes unfold it really develops,0.026979184
her into a complex individual you really empathize and feel for her fears and her,0.03500263
concerns and the things that she is going through she's incredibly easy to empathize with,0.05420781
the situations that Burnham has written into the film into the screenplay are really incredible,0.009099713
and the writing is really spot-on the actors are given some incredible moments to work,0.015083039
with and that transform this film into something of a rather sublime dramedy about the,0.06490729
trials and tribulations of growing up in the 21st century technology plays a big part,0.014955324
of this film kayla has a YouTube channel and across the film we see how,0.02901398
internet and online communication is becoming and has become a really important and meaningful part,0.016795887
of communication to a lot of people growing up right now and how the Internet,0.03750239
is an important part of the maturation experience and how that impacts the relationships that,0.014855546
people have and the fears that people have growing up with the internet right at,0.017809628
their hands but outside of that the situations that Burnham has brought into this film,0.036132775
are really really poignant the relationship between Kayla and her father the relay ship between,0.0345676
Kayla and some high schoolers that she meets are incredibly well developed and give us,0.086245716
these wonderful glimpses at the difficulty of relationships and the fears that come out of,0.037150506
relationships that work or don't work when you're in middle school going into high school,0.05625325
and the acting is brilliant LLC Fischer who plays Kayla is phenomenal and Burnham has,0.028092036
done a great job choosing a young actress who is not recognizable who can jump,0.10507507
into this role as this eighth grader who is is feeling insecure and unsure of,0.0896488
herself and looking for ways to grow into this world Josh Hamilton as the father,0.04988279
is wonderful and even the small supporting characters should get a shout out Jake Ryan,0.049348645
another young actor who plays the sort of awkward lovable boy who comes into Kayla's,0.07130702
life at different times is absolutely phenomenal and just crushes this role as the easily,0.027372973

his scimitars to do a really great job of capturing with such simple photography such,0.030264525
