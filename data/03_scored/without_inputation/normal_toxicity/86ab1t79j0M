hey everyone i'm mariana and let's talk about one of my most anticipated films of the year Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk,0.07917245
I don't think there's a point in me describing the plot,0.082207076
it's exactly what it sounds like world war ii Dunkirk evacuation,0.16272563
that's the whole movie and Christopher Nolan really takes a different approach to a war film here compared to what we're used to seeing from movies like this,0.074613824
it's not a story of one person's heroism or a story of a smaller group of people getting personal during the war or a story that involves strategic planning,0.067521
it's none of these things this is about survival in a very specific situation,0.09295391
there is very little dialogue,0.07073478
there is essentially no exposition or backstory from the beginning,0.047807388
you are thrown right into the action,0.31089434
and you are just stressed as hell for an hour and 46 minutes now if you're like me you were probably a little surprised by the pg-13 rating when I heard that that's what it was earlier this year,0.25123194
I was a little skeptical how is Nolan going to pull off a war film without an r-rating,0.1501205
well he does,0.05574701
and it is one of the best war films I've ever seen,0.1488173
he does it with tension,0.081248984
he doesn't was sound he doesn't with scale and to be quite honest I was blown away by this film what's interesting is that,0.1520583
no one makes a very conscious choice not to get the audience familiar with the characters because Dunkirk is not about any one person's story,0.047610056
you don't get to find out what their friends and family situation is you don't know what their hopes and dreams are because that's really not the point where other directors may take an approach that is more personal,0.0799923
nolan really wants this audience to understand that on this beach while they may all be different people,0.23989673
they're also all the same waiting for ships hoping to get home trying to survive another day,0.080343835
he challenges the audience to root for all of these soldiers because it's a terrible situation and because war is more than one person's story,0.087936275
we get three different perspectives beach water and air which helps us piece together the overall picture,0.06763354
and while each of these perspectives has their own set of characters the dialogue is very minimal because there's no reason for them to explain anything they know what the situation is they're only going to talk when it's necessary,0.056137253
and yet even though we know very little about these people we still get a sense of what kind of people they are the cast is perfect,0.14947432
and I really liked that Nolan used his stars sparingly while giving a lot of attention to less familiar faces Tom Hardy and Mark Rylance are probably the biggest names here but they're not there to show off their performances are beautifully subtle,0.08295264
I really appreciated that personally I'm a big fan of Killian Murphy and he has some great moments here too Finn Whitehead place Tommy who's our lead character on the beach and though I haven't seen him in anything else,0.2874716
I'm definitely hoping to see more of him in future films,0.13469008
he did really really well and guess what who knew Harry Styles could act to be honest,0.059829537
I would not know that that's who it was that the internet wasn't buzzing about it for months now because I know next to nothing about one direction but you know if you are going into this film and you're afraid that you're going to I roll throughout the whole thing because of Harry Styles he's actually pretty good in it obviously this is a visually stunning film,0.089665785
I don't think we would expect anything less from Christopher Nolan at this point,0.09742295
he knows what he's doing you absolutely must see dunkirk on the biggest screen you can I saw it at IMAX,0.15934712
and that was some experience also the wonderful Hans Zimmer score is going to play a really big role in how stressed out you're going to be while watching this movie it's the ticking bomb type of score,0.18032472
that's the best way,0.06489321
I can describe it and it just builds and builds as things are escalating on screen and as you would expect it gets loud which along,0.08637563
the fact that every shot and explosion you hear sounds very crisp just adds to the overall tension,0.21035363
this movie is all tension,0.11069975
no extraneous movie just tension,0.072736055
I could talk about this movie for much longer,0.11281743
but I don't want to get into spoilers there,0.060094967
were moments that were terrifying to me despite the lack of graphic violence there were moments that had me tearing up,0.16416077
there was some beautiful powerful writing,0.064398125
and there despite the very minimal amount of dialogue,0.08367447
I was rooting for all these characters,0.080842994
and I was consistently stressed from the beginning to the end of the film and I really do appreciate the different kind of approach Nolan took with this,0.03903714
dunkirk was a very memorable and impactful experience for me,0.09757521
so here we go are you ready for this,0.10706267
