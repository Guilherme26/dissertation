hey everybody today i am going to be reviewing dunkirk this film came out in,0.21746749
2017 it was written and directed by christopher nolan at this point in his career,0.061227717
nolan had become a bona fide kind of blockbuster auteur and we really don't have,0.1500925
many of those nowadays but it gave him a lot of freedom and a lot,0.058927886
of creative control and i think this film it seems to be a labor of,0.15056393
love for him because he came up with the idea over two decades ago in,0.08244728
the mid-90s when he was sailing up the english channel where a lot of the,0.06373856
evacuations had taken place at dunkirk i think he really wanted to be ambitious but,0.14904614
in a way that is very different from how he's been ambitious in the past,0.06951009
he pushed himself ironically into restraint and i think that's a really hard thing to,0.12024407
do for a hollywood director to accept and be willing to do to push themselves,0.12732182
but i have to hand it to him he did go out of his comfort,0.37275428
zone for this one and he wrote a super concise script which is a lot,0.13246389
shorter than i think anything else he's ever done he wanted to use a lot,0.1394356
of the elements of his cinematic philosophy that he's used throughout his career but just,0.06928446
in a different way where he's stripping all of the elements of the story back,0.05280892
the exposition the character motivations so that the tension and the climactic build of everything,0.036881648
becomes the focus so it's an experiment in tension building normally a lot of that,0.098973624
would take place in the third act of a film and especially in nolan films,0.12044676
that's certainly what happens in his third acts but here he's kind of stretching it,0.15169488
into a feature length experience slightly different approach but familiar ideas now of course those,0.022372082
of you who watch my channel regularly know that i uh famously or infamously i'm,0.55717623
not a fan of christopher nolan and a lot of people really fume over my,0.21895015
criticisms of his work which i find amusing but i think that you might misinterpret,0.16472812
me a little bit i think people distort what i say and turn it into,0.33559182
this really dramatic thing but i don't hate him i don't think that he's an,0.21023144
untalented person quite the contrary i think he has a lot of talent but i,0.43567145
would agree that yes i am quite tough on him maybe tougher on him than,0.0892333
i am certain directors and i'm similar with people like darren aronofsky for example people,0.1529066
love to say oh you just don't get him or oh you're just trying to,0.14601797
be edgy with a different type of opinion and it's like come on give me,0.26169416
some credit i am tough on him because i always thought that he had the,0.1019992
capacity to truly be great if he could just bring out some of his strengths,0.18170165
over here maybe tame some weaknesses here he could truly make something balanced and something,0.06741756
really great but over and over and over again he falls short for me and,0.111591734
that's just my opinion but it is really frustrating for me as a viewer but,0.083158836
i actually think that this film in particular dunkirk is the perfect film to reflect,0.067778915
on my frustrations throughout his career and how he's learned to work with them and,0.08176928
reign them in and gain a little bit of perspective on them so that he,0.31089434
could reach this peak because this film ladies and gentlemen is a nolan film that,0.27336732
i actually liked a lot i think truly nolan is nearly reaching his his potential,0.10174243
here his potential as an artist just as a storyteller as a filmmaker as a,0.16057754
technician my key problems with nolan have been less about his philosophy and more just,0.14955784
about the execution of it and if we go back to memento which of course,0.16129988
is one of his very first films he lays out his philosophy on film and,0.13773955
just the idea of what he's interested in so it would be kind of memory,0.102544665
and dreams how that affects film what is true what is an illusion what is,0.10953374
manipulation and how does all of that affect the narrative and our experience viewing the,0.077927105
narrative and i do enjoy memento i think it is quite unique and interesting but,0.07262746
at the same time i still struggle maybe not with the ideas because i do,0.10179657
think they're quite provocative and ambitious but just in the execution which is built around,0.15324539
this gimmick you know the idea of of doing the narrative in reverse and while,0.06365988
i like the idea of that just that construct to kind of express the thematic,0.15001975
intention and just the film's philosophy but it's done just you know in a very,0.03924838
literal way that really lacks true maturity and complexity that i felt that he had,0.11138604
in him even back then but i could forgive it because it was an early,0.062447198
work then he goes on in his career and the films become more about making,0.074497454
the construct idea the technical building blocks to create the illusion in a way that,0.09326019
to me kind of bogs down the rest of the film in a lot of,0.14655468
wordy exposition and it feels kind of just like a convoluted chess match i'm thinking,0.219015
about movies like interstellar and of course films like inception which many people do argue,0.1462314
that it is a masterpiece but i've always kind of leaned in the direction of,0.111973345
feeling that it's more artificially cerebral than it actually is convincingly cerebral nolan loves to,0.42700616
explore the mechanics of filmmaking the mechanics of narrative structure and how to invert them,0.11794994
so we're getting a unique perspective on it but it just it kind of feels,0.058073547
again like a gimmick very disjointed to me the masters of cinema especially the people,0.2687717
that look at dreams and its effect on the cinematic language and i'm meaning like,0.07877107
the wells of the world the bertrand vanillas the uh the david lynch's when they,0.31089434
are at their best they are effortless in terms of weaving the mechanics into the,0.06788898
illusion it's not labored or overwrought or clunky with its metaphors it's just easing in,0.18796481
to me it reminds me of like before you're baking something and you're folding cream,0.19459917
into a bowl there's a technique to it but they're they're really allowing all of,0.06370324
that to happen more organically with with maturity dunkirk is exploring tension cinematically but it's,0.10631563
also exploring time it's exploring story structure in a way that is clear and that,0.057323787
is focused but in a way where it is interwoven with the experience seamlessly nolan,0.09105535
is exploring triptych structure in a narrative sense with this movie so he's using three,0.14273643
different timelines three different narratives that all are going to intersect climactically three different points,0.052950602
of view of the allied forces so the first one would be soldiers evacuating the,0.08587956
beaches at dunkirk and i think this is supposed to take place over about a,0.1495687
week's time then you have a story of a civilian uh father and son who,0.14911401
are on a boat that takes place over a course of a day and then,0.06894769
you get the point of view from the pilots in the air and that i,0.08970872
think takes place over the course of an hour so it's a trifold sort of,0.112301394
thing but it's designed in a way again where everything is building almost like a,0.049895912
like a symphony even though all the timelines are quite different it's edited in a,0.10300765
way where the climax is building harmoniously and to do that is really difficult but,0.07035824
it's done meticulously here perfectly balanced but it all fits in line with his philosophies,0.06994023
that we saw even in memento about how memory and emotional entanglement can sort of,0.06361729
distort and shift the meaning of certain situations and we see here how editing can,0.15040934
really manipulate time regardless of the timelines of the three different stories they all feel,0.083587565
like they're happening at the same time in the same amount of time and it,0.06795206
feels very real and very raw to me because in very tense situations in life,0.11028715
or death situations there's all kinds of things that happen strange coincidences the people that,0.22743466
you meet in the heat of battle that you never knew them you don't know,0.17953072
their background yet sharing this very visceral experience that very few people get to share,0.06482872
can change your perceptions of that person and and change your perceptions of the event,0.14720835
everything in this movie feels immediate partially because of the way that it's shot for,0.16364744
the most part you're really only seeing the point of view of the people we're,0.075778544
following so the edges of the frame are limited for us as well as the,0.06032839
point of view of the actual characters themselves the cinematography really focuses on the detail,0.05743772
something really intense in a face in the foreground while everything else is kind of,0.12607811
in in soft focus which gives us that paranoia but we it's like we feel,0.111119054
everything and we're present with the character on screen as though we're in their personal,0.03459736
space it's very intimate but then you contrast that with a lot of the shots,0.16747655
in the air which is really giving us that that special perspective these sweeping beautiful,0.14615268
shots in deep focus are really spectacular very reminiscent of like a david lean film,0.16664746
lawrence of arabia and the film has a very modern feel to it as though,0.060109105
it's not rooted in any timeline even though it is recalling specific events in the,0.034978
past it is true to nolan in that sense that it's minimalistic the mison scene,0.15142453
is minimalistic and just the experience of watching the film was very unique and i,0.04507083
really responded to it it felt like a blend of different directors techniques it had,0.05874725
that that tension and the climactic build of like a an action film a really,0.071029164
good one like mad max the sweep and that kind of introspection of like a,0.1514498
a david lean film and yet it has that methodical kind of technical approach that,0.05852951
you might get from a a stanley kubrick i can't tell you how happy i,0.3431502
am to see how skeletal the script is which really goes in line with the,0.070816755
aesthetic of the rest of the film if there's one thing that i have always,0.079196446
struggled with maybe the maybe the most with nolan it was always his dialogue nolan,0.083515264
dialogue for me has often felt really just expository needlessly expository and overly wordy where,0.14864245
the subtext is just spilled out for us on the surface rather than us doing,0.10259216
any of the heavy lifting and it just feels amateurish and yes i do feel,0.10157471
like a lot of his actors and in his his ensemble of characters in his,0.15078801
movies they do feel more like pawns in a chess game rather than real characters,0.15019548
which actually can be great i think that's really worked in the past i'm thinking,0.06261052
about a movie like nocturama by bertrand vanilla as an example but here again it,0.13826007
always felt a little disjointed and gimmicky but not here the dialogue is kept to,0.08846074
a minimum in dunkirk let's not use empathy or get into the politics of war,0.19161576
or any of that because i think it's it's really unnecessary to this story this,0.08096913
is kind of a perfect cut of meat right here with no no gristle and,0.24913712
yes in a way they still the characters in this movie still do feel like,0.053194005
chess pieces that are functioning to explore the cinematic structure but again here it just,0.047638632
feels more authentic more sophisticated where the intents are clear but we let that take,0.070683345
a back seat to the experience itself so that all the elements can come together,0.086672306
and bloom rather than just breaking the flow as they so often do for me,0.08517369
it is a very unique type of war film one of the best war films,0.08117096
i've seen in a really long time the realism and everything i do appreciate about,0.13700196
nolan and always have how he insists on doing everything as much as he can,0.15060906
for real without relying too much on cgi and it really really is effective now,0.06845091
of course any film auteur typically the big ones have a frequent composer that they,0.06149307
like to collaborate with in the case of nolan that would be hans zimmer and,0.06667445
as many of you know i'm not a fan of hans zimmer and i've been,0.093283124
quite vocal about that but i'm less kind to han zimmer than i am uh,0.11613169
christopher nolan and a lot of people disagree my struggles with zimmer are actually quite,0.083305076
similar to my issues with nolan over time for me zimmer when he's composing he's,0.14872666
always tackling what is the most literal most abrasive aspects of tension building really heavy,0.12619752
percussion going straight for the jugular type of soundscapes that overwhelm to me rather than,0.16234128
enhance i feel like i'm drowning in the sound for a lot of those films,0.22202855
rather than allowing it to kind of color the world create a frame around it,0.19164862
to be able to express things through complex instrumentation and melody but no it's just,0.055545468
it's harsh heavy minimalism without any intellect however i didn't hate this one i i,0.218001
wish it had been better i wish it were more on the level of the,0.07232447
film itself but i do respect hans zimmer for actually being more restrained a lot,0.06227846
like nolan he's repressing those natural urges and going more for the the minimalism for,0.10796968
the subtlety and the instrumentation drawing out the tension here and i actually think that,0.09015614
ironically some of that heaviness actually works well for this particular film just because yeah,0.15275459
you know you're surrounded by like this drowning heavy metallic feeling which really serves being,0.26520646
surrounded by all these machines and like these giant boats tipping over and being shot,0.42162186
at but at the same time i can't help wishing that no one would go,0.07258627
for a composer that yeah still has that minimalism and that modern edge to him,0.07911107
but had more light and shade and could experiment more with with sound textures more,0.05002592
somebody like mika levy i think would be really perfect for a film like this,0.10011406
but i'm really nitpicking here i don't hate the score i just wish it had,0.10447418
been a little more elevated like the rest of the film and if i had,0.053287685
any other complaints it would be just i know i said i i appreciate how,0.06793907
stripped back the dialogue is but there are points that it still feels a little,0.03758999
bit too expository having the kenneth branagh character be just kind of his sole purpose,0.30298448
there is to be the person to give us exposition and the way that it,0.07598819
was handled at the end felt a little bit too neat and tidy but again,0.06809807
those are minor issues that i have i really like i said before i really,0.086174436
liked this film and i didn't expect to i had never seen it until very,0.07292861
very recently and i think it really gets better after multiple viewings but i live,0.052526794
for these moments where a filmmaker that i know has always been so close and,0.06897575
just hasn't reached that potential is finally getting somewhere where they're really refining their taste,0.095019735
and becoming a true master of their craft and that that's what i've seen here,0.1169008
and looking back at nolan you know it hasn't always been an easy journey for,0.03704609
me but i think with this film it really is worth it and that is,0.0927899
