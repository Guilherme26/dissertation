Goodfellas there's a straight magic Goodfellas is easily hands-down one of my favorite movies of,0.058645252
all time so it's my by default my favorite Martin Scorsese movie Robert DeNiro plays,0.022825778
Frank Sheeran who's a you know real life character who you know worked with mob,0.13995332
you know we're very closely with Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci who they brought,0.031505093
out of retirement for this joint Joe Pesci's been shelling he's been I'm out the,0.048238453
game this one I think I'm out they pull me back they blue leave a,0.109183244
key and they say like Robert and Martin had to really convince him to come,0.011216992
do this movie that must be nice man you when you're good you just walk,0.06054169
away from the game for years be like I don't know like you're settled you,0.05165417
said you don't need the money whatever and then you can demand whatever you want,0.028845023
if legs look give me seven million dollars to do this movie and Netflix like,0.13410701
we had money this movie costs a hundred and fifty million dollars to me a,0.016196556
hundred and fifty million dollars for drama this is ridiculous man man yeah I bet,0.2522411
you Joe was like give me 75 million dollars and there's our joke come on,0.055220887
please Netflix man we bottomed the Soviet baby man three and a half hours 150,0.22918586
million this is better be good excuse my language but man you know and the,0.025568994
critics loved it they was like yo this is a masterpiece oh and how can,0.07402762
I forget who else is in this Al Pacino so you got Alba Chino Robert,0.034807064
De Niro Joe Pesci in one move I'm saying the last time Al Pacino or,0.03472525
Robert De Niro all together real righteous kill we just go forget about that that,0.35014674
movie was hot guy hot righteous kill was a hot garbage it was like somebody,0.68089914
took some garbage boiled it added some seasoning you know there's an old here the,0.1833592
garbage put in the bowl and served it hot but he that's the Pacino De,0.3270084
Niro combo that we all love so it's good to see them back again it's,0.072737835
really the story about a guy Frank Sheeran he's Irish and he starts doing like,0.04713691
you know jobs with mob-connected men he starts you know rising up the ranks doing,0.050718922
doing odd jobs or isn't it then kind of doing hits a little bit you,0.21086255
know I want to put a business out there but you know doing some real,0.055808242
dirt and doing what he ever had to do for them essentially it's like I'll,0.08947585
do it I'll do it I'll do it you know I mean and so you,0.06585185
still get that Scorsese you know people getting capped we've come to expect like you,0.09014702
know people getting shot up you know this in here well at three and a,0.28385556
half hours it's gonna be the slow pace it's a slow pace it's a slow,0.05407278
pace like because it goes through all these years ago it goes and so they're,0.024756804
using this special effects thing the D age you know the actors and make them,0.0644237
look older make them look younger so they're doing all of this and some people,0.05854148
thought it was distracting I really didn't bother me too much I was just like,0.033913724
okay I couldn't they never really made Robert De Niro look young no like he,0.06534365
was supposed to be mad long ago he was still looking old so they were,0.050428238
trying to make him look young and they kind of fumbled now I'm like he's,0.063986674
still look old but just smooth the skin that's all it was he was an,0.09976291
old man with smooth skin it's like yo this is me in my 20s and,0.15880461
he looked like Robert De Niro in his seventies with smooth skin that's the only,0.084402494
the only thing I really saw so basically is that and you know you you,0.029927278
get to see Robert De Niro's family how his daughter looked at him and I,0.054015573
thought that was a really interesting dynamic within the story is just how how his,0.011623419
kids viewed what he was doing because a lot of times you don't really see,0.05351602
that you see you know these guys have families of course but you don't really,0.017292114
see like a kid that really doesn't like what you're doing and knows it because,0.055542834
kids man we out here man we we we see what our parents do and,0.097178675
it affects us for them to really play on that I really enjoyed that aspect,0.057475857
of it because it was like yo I don't I don't like what you're doing,0.06715029
you know cuz a lot of times kids don't feel like they have any place,0.079744875
to say that to their parents or they just hold it in or they just,0.040686622
become what their parents were but it's good just to see like I'm not feeling,0.03727556
this from a little girl throughout you know understands just to see that transition Al,0.045203883
Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa he killed it in this movie he nailed it you know,0.42350632
a lot of times Al Pacino can go over the top he's been going over,0.027250579
the top you know in his later roles all right man just this dial it,0.060498454
back a little bit no I will not you know but in this it worked,0.07801673
because that's the type of person Jimmy Hoffa was but if you look up Jimmy,0.023202935
Hoffa like he was fiery like he you know he got the union's really going,0.04801096
like he was one of the main guys in the country like it was the,0.039444726
president then like Jimmy Hoffa and so what he was doing was really big really,0.041828077
important and so I felt like you needed that type of delivery for Jimmy Hoffa,0.032440342
and I thought he nailed it I thought he was a doe very stubborn but,0.1543113
a dope character to watch you were all in and you kind of respect how,0.14551425
he wasn't scared of the mob I like to see that even though most of,0.04594756
the people in movies they just bow down to the mob you know it was,0.08496524
it was interesting to see a character that even though they can hurt you he,0.06969262
still never really backed down and I thought that was pretty dope Joe Pesci's character,0.079054415
you know usually Joe Pesci in the Martin Scorsese movie he's the hotheads fireball short,0.16503273
Wolverine I kill you right now I kill you what's funny in my job to,0.85767585
you was funny you know just a hot Headz volcano now he's completely subdued quiet,0.22169973
you know still we'll get you cue but it's very like understated quiet but when,0.033840552
he's around you feel the presence of like you know danger like serious business I,0.08515482
can hurt you I can get things done and I love how Joe Pesci played,0.10279815
it very understated very chill very quiet and it's like yo it works and so,0.05004775
you know a lot of people are clowning it this long and slow but I,0.07357663
think they really just focusing on the wrong things like you know even though the,0.05374484
the age of fire didn't really work all right it didn't work but I could,0.033471376
still focus on the story and the performances and I feel like it was a,0.017582133
