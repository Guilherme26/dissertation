today we are going to be beginning our discussion of five star plus movies now,0.022084096
a five star plus movie isn't just a good movie and it isn't just a,0.025001593
great movie it's a movie that makes you stand in awe because of how incredible,0.027031733
the art of filmmaking can be a five star plus film is one that has,0.016316954
left its mark on the film industry one that when you look at the modern-day,0.011395927
movie these are the reasons that it's there today I'd like to make one of,0.060185816
these movies every month as we look at the best that cinema has to offer,0.032014623
first one we are going to be looking at is a very surreal German expressionistic,0.18953876
film called the cabinet of dr. Caligari now this is a fantastic early horror film,0.034283563
that was released in 1919 so I will be discussing spoilers but seeing as this,0.024782747
film is nearly a hundred years old if you haven't seen it now I think,0.034634117
it's the time to do so so without further ado let's look at the magic,0.047234025
that is the cabinet of dr. Caligari the film officially begins when we see these,0.024657693
two men talking now one of them we are soon going to find out his,0.20213269
name Francis and he is going to be our main character the other is just,0.010003031
a man who he is able to tell his story to all the sudden a,0.028097358
ghostly figure appears and Francis tells the other that that woman is his wife and,0.042462
he begins to tell the story of how she became the way that she did,0.0226515
let's take a moment to appreciate that this is a nonlinear narrative released in 1919-20,0.018375698
two years before Citizen Kane in 75 years before Pulp Fiction which are both two,0.017244887
films that are known for innovating the nonlinear style but this did it long before,0.035306618
either these were around the film cuts to the town where one of the men,0.022433318
grew up and we see this incredible backdrop this is probably what the film is,0.009120998
best known for these vivid and surreal images that really show that you're living in,0.029384488
a world with different rules you're out looking at Germany you're looking at something very,0.07148329
different and the choice of backgrounds helped make this movie so much better shadows were,0.014171072
colored in everything that you're seeing was hand-drawn it really shows that this is the,0.03308158
art of filmmaking the background also shows the oppression of the German regime all of,0.17280807
the houses are built on a hill with the castle on top of it showing,0.01928567
the oppression of the common folk by those in charge and those with wealth we,0.031750545
are introduced to really our main antagonist dr. Caligari and what this film did so,0.01669744
well was used this film to tell the story instead of describing an evil man,0.09856159
you can actually see him this is really the first time that cinema as an,0.03020998
art was able to show not only art but also storytelling this shot in particular,0.068190634
reminds me of a dr. Seuss drawing now albeit this is the scariest dr. Seuss,0.027941704
drawing out there but you see the man in power sitting on an unreasonably large,0.058590706
chair leaning over as it checks the public records or on a podium that has,0.02988404
literal symbols on it you don't need to be a genius to pick up some,0.049904738
stereotypes about an oppressive regime and knowing what we know about Germany between World War,0.13649635
one and World War two he may be saying something about the government later we,0.089140594
find out that the town clerk has been killed obviously we know who the perpetrator,0.3535428
is and this tells us so much about dr. Caligari after the town clerk made,0.011363997
him wait for only three minutes he was killed this shows that dr. Caligari is,0.32045949
not someone to be trifled with at the fair which is essentially a metaphor for,0.02901398
consumerism dr. Caligari sets up his psalm universe and draws a remarkable crowd by telling,0.031195782
about his creature after hearing about the wonders of caesar we were finally told about,0.04279459
him he is 23 years old who has been asleep for the past 23 years,0.03254677
we see the creature and Oh God look at that haircut look I get he's,0.07235668
been asleep for 23 years and this was 1919 I come on a bowl cut,0.051023576
and all reality however actually really loved this shot shows the pride dr. Caligari has,0.06311462
for Caesar it almost looks paternal this is Caligari his way of making money and,0.022307599
killing his enemies it's all captured in this one shot Caesar wakes up and his,0.7630553
23 years of sleep Caesar began to learn everything present past and future people begin,0.035193536
to ask questions and this part really shows off human greed through wanting to obtain,0.24771771
the impossible like knowing how long you are live your ultimate li and knew your,0.09569332
life later that night we see our protagonist being murdered and this is shown through,0.2143368
the use of shadow obviously the MPAA wasn't around in the 1920s but there were,0.022040196
some guidelines his phone was able to get around these guidelines by using shadow which,0.026800914
is very innovative his friend Frances remembers what the prophecy was and now the film,0.012481506
is about to get good Francis reports this theory to the law but is still,0.0131041175
unsatisfied he decides to go after Caesar and eventually Caligari himself the law catches up,0.066640094
with Caligari and they question him and he's chosen that Caesar is still there and,0.01595975
assures him that he has been asleep ever since the fair that day and he,0.08182424
will not rise without him anyway but the murder is revealed by someone else and,0.11263954
Caligari is say at this point Jane the woman from earlier meets dr. Caligari who,0.028535048
shows her Caesar who wakes up and this is without a doubt one of my,0.08415903
favorite scenes in the film there was something so great about the way the Caligari,0.016368173
and Caesar look at her as she runs away it is so unsettling and so,0.06811547
great that combined with the great score shows off some excellent excellent filmmaking and our,0.017382579
next scene which is ultimately a collection of different clips that all happen at the,0.04166178
same time francis is checking in to see what dr. Caligari is doing he sees,0.030786695
him with Caesar the next part of the scene however shows Caesar breaking into Jane's,0.034393985
house with his knife this is so unsettling so creepy and one of my favorite,0.3131099
scenes in horror history one of people's biggest complaints with us movies that you see,0.047136243
very dry camera angles every shot is long drawn out and for the most part,0.21401154
almost stationary but it works so well in this movies you see Caesar approach the,0.020824904
bed knife in hand you see someone line there asleep someone coming to murder her,0.59445596
there's nothing you can do about it as an audience member nothing anyone can do,0.035051852
about it I'm certain most people are familiar with dramatic irony that Shakespeare perfected which,0.018915826
the audience knows something that the characters inside the play do not know however this,0.016587684
is the best case of dramatic irony when you're seeing someone about to be murdered,0.35479805
and there's nothing you can do about a Caesar approaches the bed you can just,0.077863075
see how well the shot is friend so well execute Caesar raises the knife to,0.3249907
kill and yet he can't do it just like this film source material dracula Caligari,0.5334623
falls in love with one of his victims and kidnaps her and again as they,0.32875502
leave you get this long shot signifying how there's nothing you can do to try,0.21034105
and help her her family rushes in they check the window and see Caesar taking,0.04231233
Jane away is such an incredible shot Caesar escapes James family catches up with her,0.1422116
and Caesar runs off into the however Caesars reign of terror ends after he falls,0.18106964
from a hill and dies he revealed that the Caesar that we had been seeing,0.25729004
earlier was one that Caligari kept was actually a dummy we find out Caligari is,0.0977667
really the real mastermind behind all this francis catches up with Caligari and he knows,0.066712596
that he's behind it they chase each other and Caligari runs into a mental asylum,0.3838744
this entire sequence is so well edited together going back and forth between caesar Caligari,0.017771712
and francis the police it is really great filming obviously the standards for good editing,0.28496858
and good filmmaking today have changed but this is one of the pioneers of innovative,0.018026477
editing instead of just seeing one clip we're seeing a collection of clips all happening,0.06528312
at the same time there used to build up suspense and tone and it is,0.019154629
so well executed to get such an incredible no next we see francis follow Caligari,0.15047652
to the asylum after he assumes Caligari may be a patient the hoard is revealed,0.03972011
that he's the director albeit this isn't the most shocking twist you're just introduced to,0.020898739
his Asylum minutes ago and yeah this is one of the earliest cases of a,0.051671464
plot twist this crazy old man may not be that crazy he may be the,0.40056854
director of a well established insane asylum the Francis tells the other hospital employees that,0.06325431
he found out in Caligari is now under supervision what I love about this film's,0.020995857
final act is that it isn't so much a horror movie but instead of detectives,0.04982026
go you finally learn about the real calendar this reveal is so great and you,0.04988345
get the first dynamic or moving shot in this entire movie you find out exactly,0.05550093
what happened the entire time there's also after the great social stadium you find out,0.020465706
why Caligari works in the sounds we find a victim to act as his personal,0.095304854
murder cool and whether or not the director intended it or not it ended up,0.22924565
being a great social statement because what we now know about asylum and abuse we,0.050778124
get a great transition that goes to a flashback so yes this makes a flashback,0.062355645
in a story that was told to Caligari discovering Caesar for the first time Caligari,0.017380584
begins extensive research before setting his monster out on the town and he begins to,0.08273953
go crazy he sees demands all over the screen again this is excellent editing this,0.12429688
is something that has never been done for in film and yet we're seeing a,0.008497056
combination of both what's happening in the real world but also special effects that happen,0.03058714
in post-production finally we go back to France is talking to the man from the,0.07652406
beginning however this film does not end on a positive note Jane is locked away,0.039587073
in the asylum with Caesar only Caesar is out of total personality chained no longer,0.1516805
is he a murdering psychopath but instead someone who's lost and confused playing with flowers,0.52046037
in the asylum but then we get the best plot twist of all Francis might,0.038132317
be insane he's locked in the asylum just like everyone else and the film ends,0.16092455
on an ambiguous note so was the director of the asylum Caligari or did Francis,0.022059485
dream it all up we're never told it's only up to us to guess so,0.023349276
this is truly an excellent film is it a perfect movie well you could definitely,0.042979512
make an argument saying it is however undeniably this is a very innovative movie the,0.043646026
director uses color to show off time of day and similar locations which although it,0.01360101
wasn't the first time that this happened it did it in such a great way,0.051476568
the film utilized some great editing techniques some awesome dynamic shots and is all around,0.051642198
a truly excellent film it's one of my favorite horror films out there and definitely,0.04592561
one you should watch this time of year so if you've seen the cabinet of,0.01830918
dr. Caligari make sure you drop a comment and tell me what you think about,0.028477842
it do you love it do you hate it if you've never seen it before,0.16734158
and you did see it after this video tell me what you thought about it,0.026117105
I loved it for one I think it's truly one of the greatest works of,0.043542255
film that we have ever seen it's so well made so well directed so well,0.02979158
acted however not everyone feels that way so if you did enjoy this video drop,0.11048301
