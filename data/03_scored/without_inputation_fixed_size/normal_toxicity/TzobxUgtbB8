all right so I just got out of the quiet place or a quiet place,0.10864442
sorry a quiet place and before I get into anything any kind of specifics obviously,0.14413951
as per usual beginning of the review no real spoilers and then I'll be very,0.070992835
clear when I say that there's going to be some form of spoiler but before,0.06275568
I get into it I just want to say go see this movie like this,0.15096621
is the best movie I've seen in ages possibly in in like years like obviously,0.07184006
those movies that have come out that are like that I love that are like,0.11841376
Marvel movies or just like you know fun movies and stuff like this and stuff,0.26478216
like that but this movie has hit me harder than and then any movie in,0.18181625
a really long time for being kind of like a horror movie it hit me,0.31685606
in the same kind of way that something like The Green Mile would hit you,0.2417073
in terms of like an emotional scale but also an addendum to that if you,0.0914139
don't do well with tension at all like if you're somebody who really can't handle,0.23977971
any kind of tension hi rocket maybe don't go see this movie or at least,0.16023323
wait until it's like you can watch it at home and kind of separate yourself,0.117495835
from the moment obviously when you're in a theater it's very hard to to exit,0.10633929
to pull yourself out of a situation to do something to kind of remove yourself,0.7394378
from like negative feeling emotion he knows my face is red I'm gonna get into,0.2657388
that this was like my job it was just either way it was it was,0.05513132
very very very good so for those of you who don't know a quiet place,0.2746793
is a movie that was directed by John Krasinski and if that name sounds familiar,0.074635506
it's because he played Jim in the office yeah that's right Jim from the office,0.060329553
is now making really really serious movies and well some of you might be like,0.14336507
isn't it isn't it just a horror movie isn't it just like a run-of-the-mill kind,0.1540354
of horror movie it is so much more than that this movie managed to build,0.15084991
tension and character development in like such an absolutely amazing way that you're like right,0.13849051
from the get-go you care about all the characters you care about their well-being and,0.08610994
it just it just continues that tension bill just the entire time it's I honestly,0.074509054
can't think of a movie that did it in a better way the last time,0.068440326
I saw a horror movie that kind of had that level of tension and intensity,0.1610465
it would have been it follows but this goes so far beyond that in such,0.059952583
a beautifully amazing way which is kind of interesting to save for the stuff movie,0.07209784
is if you guys saw the trailers just to give you a basic rundown you,0.104074165
just you get the idea that something has happened to humanity we're kind of a,0.093013786
little bit into the future probably not too distantly in the future well yeah I,0.12711604
know for a fact it's not too distantly in the future but some things happen,0.061620917
and basically humanity's in a state where you you can't make any noise if you,0.22955403
make noise things attack you and obviously the movie goes through oh it doesn't go,0.3409244
too far into detail doesn't it doesn't do one of those like de0 type things,0.086458765
and build it into what led to where they are now really it picks up,0.084744826
about like 89 days into whatever this disaster is it tells you right like it,0.1658382
actually says it right on the screen it pretty much picks up 89 days into,0.052745
probably what I would presume would be the first incident or whatever happens and it,0.07899481
doesn't it doesn't pander it it doesn't go over it for too long you basically,0.086990535
just rocket you basically just see kind of like posters like oh like newspaper articles,0.08257579
lying around that kind of tell you with a brief idea of what happened but,0.2672205
then basically it's just John Krasinski and his family are trying to survive through this,0.08368971
ordeal and John Krasinski specifically describes it as being for his kids and I was,0.08340675
when I heard him say that in an interview I was like this is kind,0.09887401
of looks like a pretty scary horror moving its horas kids but I guess the,0.29797342
idea is is that it's supposed to show exactly how far he or you know,0.06879534
a father or a mother would go to protect their children to go to protect,0.13565476
their family so it was just kind of like an ode to them and honestly,0.08292838
when you see it you'll you'll be like wow that's that's really spot-on so it's,0.09621896
it's very it's very simple in nature when comparing it to something like annihilation just,0.3514774
because similar undertones obviously annihilation is way more of like a sci-fi focused adventure this,0.30997467
kind of just has a sci-fi undertone to it but you this is way more,0.077961616
of a self-contained story and while there is clearly a larger scale thing happening in,0.08061017
the world you are very much just focused on this one family and what they're,0.12239393
going through and and how they're trying to get not out of the situation but,0.071467966
just try to live through the situation so I would 100% recommend it even if,0.04470576
you're not necessarily a horror fan if as long as you don't hate horror as,0.15449907
long as you don't hate tension I would definitely recommend going to see this in,0.15383698
theaters because I honestly believe that this should be supported I think John Krasinski did,0.0985686
an amazing job I'm a huge fan of the office and I had a really,0.030379767
hard time seeing characters in the office outside those roles or at least outside comedy,0.0733436
roles especially somebody like John Krasinski it's very hard to see him as anything other,0.12958227
than you know in gym and and this movie totally totally you know just just,0.070964545
kicks kicks that out of me and his wife in the movies actually his wife,0.6103618
in real life Emily Blunt and that itself seemed to just really add to things,0.07872985
it was just like a very beautiful project and to know that he was involved,0.061858132
in writing the screenplay to know that he directed it and just really put it,0.057141528
all together and how beautifully it was shot and how like the cinematography and just,0.24619566
like little little things that happen in every scene and how it was directed and,0.112439334
flow flowed as a movie it was actually so amazingly well done and obviously you,0.13614643
had some jump scares but it didn't really go for anything cheap it kept you,0.14445944
kind of on your toes the entire time because you had something like you've got,0.41740108
a horror movie where the whole point is that people can't make noise so you,0.19944546
figured they so that tension that normally gets built in horror movies when they stay,0.15409179
quiet things down so they can jump scare you that doesn't always happen here because,0.15032475
there's just so much silence because they there's just so there's actually one character that,0.09738498
really exemplifies that silence even to to a higher degree so because you can't rely,0.16880788
on those usual auditory cues that you would in a horror movie I honestly felt,0.24674243
sick for like the first hour of the movie and I know that sounds bad,0.32422617
but it's because I was so tense and just waiting for things to happen that,0.0577275
I felt sick and I don't want to say that in a bad way I,0.112000704
want to say that that means that the movie did such an incredible job building,0.0969134
the scene building the tension just building that whole emotion in the viewer and it,0.05277785
was everybody was the same way anytime anything little happened like people were reacting people,0.104767606
were like putting putting their hands on their heads just honestly just so so amazing,0.65585196
and it wasn't in like a cheap way that horror movie usually our that was,0.15401395
just specifically going out of its way to like psyche Wow creep you out grossed,0.52075106
you out it was all just done because it was like shot incredibly well acted,0.37402883
incredibly well and you were just totally immersed in this world that they had created,0.26904324
that John Krasinski and the other people had created and I honestly blown away by,0.17260101
it it's definitely something I'm gonna buy on blu-ray because I want to support it,0.08059162
I want to support ideas like that things that are kind of unique and different,0.091493666
and just things that can take part of one genre and and blend it with,0.044683516
under on I'm tearing up because it was so good like it was just such,0.111617826
an emotional ride it was amazing so please definitely go see it if you have,0.12117606
any kind of interest in it whatsoever if you like horror movies if you like,0.26698488
dramas if you like just any kind of just like good movies just go check,0.13374919
it out it was absolutely amazing I think that it is going to be at,0.07551033
the forefront of its Jennifer for many many years to come I would say that,0.06292434
like 10 Cloverfield Lane would have tried to have a similar feel to it but,0.03249071
couldn't hit it on the same emotional scale like I think this is gonna be,0.13477439
a forerunner in its category which is so unique in that genre and also very,0.017063579
unique for something directed by somebody who came up in the world that's a comedy,0.2581164
actor so absolutely incredible now we're going into a few more of the spoilers I'm,0.11786279
gonna talk about things specifically that I really enjoyed that they did so this is,0.05527192
this is heavy spoiler territory III honestly implore you if you have not seen the,0.13356352
movie yet and you were planning on watching the movie just don't watch past this,0.093912795
point please don't watch past I never say this but I'm actually like I would,0.113796905
really encourage you to just click off this video if you haven't seen the movie,0.10814951
yet and you're planning on seeing the movie please click off this video this is,0.09794694
just me talking about things that I really like I like even if you are,0.09470384
the type of person that likes to oilers please just click off this video please,0.24087042
please click off this video right now okay we're going into them so right from,0.19451228
the get-go you you kind of get the you know what happened it just starts,0.123673774
off and kind of like a drug store one of the kids is sick and,0.43688217
they're just kind of looking for some kind of medicine that would help him with,0.15102252
whatever he's sick with so at this point in time it's you know mom dad,0.45159528
three kids sick kid a girl and a younger younger son there isn't being this,0.4666803
moment where that kid except a toy the younger one picks up a toy has,0.106264785
batteries in it and the they take it away from him they take the batteries,0.09452282
out but then I leave the toy there but then the daughter or the sister,0.11466828
ends up just giving him back the toy but not the batteries but then he,0.080362536
grabs the batteries before he's leaving and they're walking home and for some reason he's,0.11575176
at the back honestly that was probably the only not believable thing is that if,0.06566444
this was that kind of world and you had the youngest son I'm pretty sure,0.18250236
that even if you weren't carrying him he wouldn't be at the back you'd probably,0.11557492
have him in the middle somewheres just because for one he's young too he seems,0.08871571
to not fully grasp the severity of the situation and he's like the smallest one,0.13298012
he's more prone to walk off and he's in behind the sister who I didn't,0.1553244
mention she's deaf she can't hear anything and that actually adds a really interesting dynamic,0.29690528
to the whole thing because she can't hear she can't even necessarily tell how loud,0.17490873
she's being she can't necessarily hear what things going on around her so that's an,0.10400854
interesting dynamic but I feel like you wouldn't put the youngest kid behind the deaf,0.3240695
child that's just my and he's like pretty young I would say he's probably like,0.24684401
five or six years old he was pretty young demands of turning on the toy,0.123270765
it starts making noises and everything just it's like that whole scene was shot so,0.16976395
incredibly well everything just stops nobody's saying everything everybody is just like you get it,0.29131365
you get a close-up on emily Blunt's face and like you can tell that she,0.18366496
knows it's too late John Krasinski is just flat out running just running to try,0.103566214
to catch him and like when he's I don't even know from like like from,0.15092988
here to the wall away from him something it just crashes on the wood and,0.15570337
grabs him and then it's done and like right there from the beginning they established,0.16422716
that nobody is safe not a single person in this family not a single person,0.15086383
in this movie is safe if they are willing to kill the youngest child nobody,0.60411716
is safe in this movie so that's at 89 days in and then it cuts,0.08521401
ahead to like 472 days in so it gives you about a little over a,0.06914943
year in between when that happens and and later later on so right there that,0.053934567
really set the tone for everything that's set an emotional tone right from the beginning,0.058090784
and then when it cuts ahead you find out that you know mom's pregnant with,0.28691122
another baby and that whole thing is like what happens when the baby is born,0.2476747
the babies are allowed how are you gonna deal with it just just oh my,0.23664881
god it's just dealt with so well and then there's obviously that deals with there's,0.10815073
like a whole tension because the daughter blames herself so that turns into its whole,0.35023472
other dynamic and and oh my god and then you have like you know John,0.05045336
Krasinski as a father is trying to his best take care of his family provide,0.10637606
for his family but obviously he gets a little Stern because he's just trying to,0.16872047
protect people and she kind of gets the idea that maybe he blames her for,0.15490036
you know the son the son dying but then the mom blames herself because she,0.47272044
could have been carrying him and it's just oh it's just such a good view,0.07595204
tafolla dynamic as it as it goes through there and and that just because they,0.13654225
take that kid dies so early on you're like okay absolutely nobody is safe in,0.45738572
this movie so every little time something would happen you just be you'd be waiting,0.2827026
it'd be like there's like a TVs that showed everything going around on the perimeter,0.10441249
and at one point she's watching you know John Krasinski's character you know going to,0.08615417
get the other kids and you're like oh my god she's alone and she's just,0.178125
watching these tipi something's gonna come up behind her because it's like they're trying not,0.28869975
to make noises so they don't shut doors they don't they don't do anything that,0.12104181
can make that extra amount of noise so when these things get into houses they,0.048993338
just they can just walk in but it's they just usually don't because everything so,0.0874259
they're completely blind everything they do is based on sound in terms of the monsters,0.44229352
themselves you find out they're aliens which I you know it's cool they can go,0.12144419
like that and pander they didn't go into too much explanation they just say they're,0.09390431
heavily armored so you can't really shoot at them nobody really knows what the weakness,0.3971134
are they can't see anything and literally they're there they just have super hearing so,0.06794386
the second they can hear you they can basically find you but otherwise you're not,0.1265036
really a jeopardy from them it's very it's very interesting but I was actually surprised,0.08285054
that they showed them and they showed them really early when when the kid gets,0.08868517
attacked you see it you kind of get the idea what it looks like and,0.30613694
then it progressively kind of shows you more what they look like as the movie,0.09673149
went on more so than I thought but it's really so that they can kind,0.08678226
of exemplify what happened I actually really liked what the with the weakness ended up,0.07923698
being and it actually made like if you have something that can hear so incredibly,0.1740151
well obviously something with high frequencies would probably bother it so that was really cool,0.07743854
I like that it was self-contained I like they you know he has a whiteboard,0.13078621
with all the information they think there's three in the area by the end of,0.049983643
the movie you're left in a situation where you think that okay they could probably,0.12970167
take care of this but there's like this super emotional moment with John Krasinski protecting,0.08129961
the kids and it's like I start crying in the theater thinking you better right,0.16913801
now I want to cry and I'm like I said when I go see movies,0.10608206
I try to feel whatever the director and the creators are trying to get you,0.06472816
to feel if I feel like I'm gonna cry I don't try to hold the,0.06814073
tears back I just let him happen because that's what they're trying to get you,0.07522318
to feel and yeah here I go I'm actually crying because it was that emotional,0.15230338
it was so amazing like I said certain parts of this movie really like the,0.101281054
only other movie I can think of that elicited this kind of emotional reaction was,0.11711636
Green Mile and Green Mile is like one of the saddest movies in the world,0.18341401
and this is suppose to be a horror movie but it's just it's amazing so,0.15026163
I think that those were some of the really strong moments I know this is,0.042737905
the spoiler part but I'm really hesitant to even talk about more spoilers because I,0.092760876
know some people can't help themselves some people can't help themselves but I just go,0.13396399
see it it was amazing it was so well done it wasn't one of these,0.15066363
things where you're trying to figure out how to save the rest of the world,0.07477402
but you're left in a situation we're like hey okay humanity might end up being,0.28469765
okay but it really is just focusing on this family their struggles and how they're,0.09803629
gonna make it out in the end so honestly fantastic job like literally the second,0.14805225
I finished watching the movie I like tweeted said amazing job two drunkards in ski,0.36110923
cuz I honestly think that he needs he needs an award for this he needs,0.09136584
an award for this if this is not nominated for an Oscar next year I'm,0.059706632
gonna be super pissed off you guys are gonna see a video about me yelling,0.53490317
have a ye quiet place was not nominated and I'm talking Best Picture I'm not,0.112046584
talking like cinematography I'm not talking aside stuff I'm talking best picture because this is,0.112085484
the best movie I've seen in years I think honestly because oh my god go,0.079546295
see this movie it was fantastic don't judge me for the emotional reaction that's gonna,0.102342375
do it for today's video so thank you all so much for watching have a,0.059048854
