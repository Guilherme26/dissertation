hey everybody today I'm going to be talking about a parasite this film was co-written,0.29019353
and directed by bong joon-ho he's the director that's gained a lot of momentum in,0.054109365
terms of his international success and acclaim I would say within the last 10 years,0.014004776
or so he's a nod to her that's quite appreciated in the US and Paris,0.0478593
that really is my first exposure to this director I went in knowing almost nothing,0.017753752
about the movie and I think that that is the best way to experience it,0.04581519
if you haven't seen the film I actually recommend that you stop watching this review,0.039358918
go watch it and then come back and see what I have to say because,0.036126126
I just think that you're gonna get a lot more out of it I think,0.053323116
the strength of this film is how it surprises you when it surprises you it's,0.03179112
never really jarring in the traditional sense you know it's not kind of jolting you,0.08312002
back and forth your emotions everything feels very seamless and in terms of the transitions,0.024716228
it feels like it's more kind of sliding and curving its way around this plot,0.04367862
rather than taking really kind of angular corners it's very meticulous very controlled you never,0.030672949
know where it's gonna go tonally or in terms of the plot and that is,0.016620278
quite refreshing I often talk about movies like this it's a common theme in the,0.033325702
movies that we see it's where you know we're talking about a director who is,0.011118544
making a movie that is pulling from all of these very distinct very different genres,0.049179688
from the past and sort of passing them together where you as an audience member,0.035250742
and certainly the director feels very aware of the influences where the story itself becomes,0.013941584
more I mean as I said conscious it's it's more about how the culture has,0.032768276
shaped the point of view of this writer of this director this particular story and,0.0616419
while this does have a lot of that in it it's not that kind of,0.028392034
movie at the same time this is a film that wants to swerve in and,0.053748835
out of these different lanes these these each Lane being a different genre but it's,0.03759618
doing it in a way that is very stealthy and it's almost almost invisible at,0.017330695
times the film is dabbling in all kinds of things at first it seems to,0.027717538
be more kind of like a like a black comedy satire it has a lot,0.1259778
of slapstick comedy but then it starts to beer more into the horror thriller genre,0.16949278
but ultimately it is a movie that is about it's a social commentary on class,0.033083573
struggle but all of this is a homogenous blend that seems to have all the,0.047294557
flavors of all of these ideas but it's all at once and it's all one,0.059612427
concoction and there's not a moment where you don't feel that the film is completely,0.028883604
in control of every every beat every little thing that it is saying every hair,0.10404537
is perfectly in place and there was just one moment I can't even give you,0.05140872
the context for the moment I don't remember where it happened I just remember seeing,0.013511876
this image it was very quick but you could see kind of an image of,0.034199752
Alfred Hitchcock and I think some other people that might have influenced him and that's,0.08049188
like the one time where it really feels conscious as if to say yes I,0.044899896
am pulling from all of these different influencers these different tours and their genres but,0.036442086
it is so brief it it's so quick you miss it and of course I'm,0.04288306
going to pay attention to that especially being who I am I'm gonna notice all,0.065757394
of the different ways that the story is being constructed but overall I found it,0.011128522
to be much more palatable for me and and something more interesting because the effect,0.020212935
of it was so subtle and so sophisticated it's a very slow boil in terms,0.06794851
of how it escalates to the climax and I think having all of that beneath,0.13106911
the service having all of these these genres and the ideas behind it be almost,0.102596596
invisible it really makes the film more layered it gives it a lot more complexity,0.02801421
more dimension because it allows us to explore everything so much more keenly you know,0.024778755
we're exploring we're aware of all of these different facets in terms of the emotions,0.02767563
on the human spectrum and we're seeing it through all of these genres which they,0.03504254
sort of define the world they define what the world is about in all kinds,0.015184812
of different ways all kinds of different points of view and it's exploring what life,0.07425246
is about and how we experience it when the film began I saw this of,0.017904082
course more as slapstick comedy because there's a lot more humor in it than I,0.2052617
was expecting and it is yeah so it's like it's like a black comedy about,0.19266911
class struggle and how it is shifted in the modern age is very satirical talking,0.07048951
about even in just the first scene how they're just living for that that Wi-Fi,0.033109516
signal that they're trying to get from other neighbors because they don't they don't have,0.014791024
any where you know the idea of pressing send on a text message that could,0.03164079
be really bad for you is it seems like to these people it's almost like,0.06078049
a clear bomb going off it's almost the same thing pressing sin can change your,0.19786686
whole life how the DIY culture is changing everything breaking the walls down on how,0.0828606
things can be done and who does things I mean we have the ability now,0.026407126
to be able to be able to take different jobs just by googling how to,0.017191006
do them and are watching youtube videos on how to do things and that changes,0.041296598
everything because you don't have to have a formal education or anything like that but,0.053520013
pretty early on I'd say especially when they start going to the actual house where,0.02477543
the film really takes place you start to get watts of the of those thriller,0.09280842
and horror vibes but that all comes to fruition more in the third act where,0.02957207
everything shifts into a more off-kilter more eccentric idea of what horror is as well,0.064471595
as the comedy where the brutality it becomes the focus it's the poor working secretly,0.09443013
underground and they are literally below the upper class what the movie seems to be,0.045248453
saying is that you always have to break a few eggs to make an omelet,0.15516739
in this sort of society one person's gain is always going to be another person's,0.0636461
loss unfortunately this movie did remind me of Jordan peels us a lot that's of,0.06808088
course a movie that came out in the United States and it was earlier this,0.063307524
year but there are so many similarities because then it is also a film that,0.033209957
is a commentary on on socio politics and it is also filtered through this genre-bending,0.045336258
lens that is it's kind of part pastiche it's part comedy it's part horror it,0.054070782
is part satire as well that's a movie that I did not get around to,0.024293836
reviewing but I did like it quite a bit however I have to say that,0.058398467
this film it takes it a lot further it takes a lot of these ideas,0.08663751
much further and it's it's more focused it's more cohesive morally as well as as,0.040997263
plot wise and it's just more skillfully or skillful in terms of how it's able,0.040771767
to manipulate the audience into feeling all of these things all of these emotions that,0.043058004
shift all over the spectrum he'll has a great quote that I love to recite,0.04458327
a lot because I think it's a great philosophy for him but you know he,0.029226175
was talking about his career change people couldn't believe that he went to you know,0.026963219
from like sketch comedy to all of these these auteur horror films but he said,0.14553353
he doesn't think that it's really that that jarring of a difference he does not,0.019618927
think that comedy is really that different from horror the the line between them is,0.03197072
actually very thin and I think that parasite also embodies that idea and I think,0.23463549
that somebody like Jordan Peele would really appreciate something like parasite it's the idea of,0.15398934
how sometimes life and its ideas are just too complex to be contained within one,0.058136385
genre life even when it is very tragic is also at the same time full,0.034309506
of a lot of awkward things and funny things it's all kinds of different genres,0.054507807
that constantly run into one another I actually think that this movie parasite could more,0.2124244
so be compared to a movie like Takashi Amie case the audition or I should,0.034012835
say audition I'm sorry I always say the UM which I feel like if you,0.03817888
haven't seen that movie and you are interested don't watch any more of this review,0.021927115
because I feel like I've already given you too much information or just with that,0.015434922
that sentence don't even look at the cover of the movie you know if you,0.042042267
can get somebody to press play for you before you watch it because the less,0.043256894
you know the better it is very similar to this film and it is also,0.030796673
one of my favorite movies of all time but for those of you who have,0.030524611
seen it I'm sure you you know what I mean how it subtly builds from,0.02649493
something that's very quiet contemplative very sweet and romantic and almost like it's a like,0.17412645
an a zoo film and then it just twists and twists and twist into this,0.07087864
so realistic horror piece and for me that that is one of the crowning achievements,0.07697572
of being able to do that sort of thing but I admire that film and,0.030349668
I admire parasite as well I would say though that something like audition is more,0.15059692
elevated more sophisticated for me there were a few times in parasite where I thought,0.12242306
that there were some kind of iffy lines but when I say all of that,0.023796279
I am very much nitpicking another reason I think that the movie does have that,0.02237944
emotional weight because it is a very tragic film is because all of the characters,0.034293544
are so nuanced and so dimensional you don't see the upper-class characters as villains necessarily,0.025431301
and you don't see the poor culprits as the villains either of course the Kim,0.07086667
family is the one that we follow them where we're going on their journey from,0.02843261
beginning to end but we do also root for the the upper-class family and I,0.031022836
think part of that is is the performance by the actress who plays the the,0.02473552
rich mother I I liked a lot of the performances in this movie but hers,0.08913328
in particular I really liked with a character like her she does need to be,0.07303384
that that that emotional center she requires the ability to embody that innocence and that,0.04119948
that gullibility and just that that natural comedic ignorance that that rich people tend to,0.16657728
have there is something kind of endearing about it and you're sort of drawn to,0.040338065
it because she's just just like anybody else she's just living her life and she's,0.17753819
doing what she believes is best for her family and in the same way the,0.031952098
Kim family is doing what is best for them of course the stakes are much,0.0352993
higher for them but but it's the same sort of thing but by the time,0.036344305
you get to the third act of the movie I think each of the main,0.041687723
players could be seen at some points as very sympathetic and at other times as,0.02667453
as villains how the plot develops and how those character motivations develop is to me,0.039336964
the overall strength and what I said does give it that emotional art because as,0.019211834
I said this is a technical achievement but also one that really does resonate with,0.016753316
you emotionally and I think overall this movie is a total knockout I think I,0.19159351
advise everyone to see it if you can because it is it's worth every minute,0.038540076
of your time and that's my review thank you all for listening all of my,0.030440133
