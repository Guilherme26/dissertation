a quiet place oh my god oh my god well where do I start tell you something when I got into this movie you've seen the trailers you already know that in the trailer everyone is Hawaii because there are these monsters out there that respond to sound and if you are not quiet they will kill yo ass so this was a different experience for a movie theater because because the majority of the movie there is no dialogue you hear everybody in the theater there were people sleeping and snoring literally one person you know people laughing and talk and you can hear everything that people were doing but other than that it was very interested made for a very interesting experience I have to say that that didn't was done well you know though the majority thought there was no dialogue it's a small amount of dialogue in the movie and they set the tone for this movie very early very early on and I just have to say that these beings in this movie are terrifying they're menacing and throughout this movie I was very tense I was a very on edge director gonna did a good job of setting that tone in doing that well I'll get one small break the problem for the movie in I was getting bored but the director probably knew that and they cut right to the danger action the thriller the suspense of everything and it's just like Oh like I can remember just doing stuff like I was really reacting to this movie when things were happening there's a true sense of danger I was thinking myself is maddening how could they live it's gonna be maddening to live like this you know and so it's it's about one family and their survival in this type of world and his father his wife there is two sons and a daughter and man I just you know they have sand everywhere so they can walk you've seen this in the trailer the sand everywhere they can walk has to be quiet doing everything it's just you just wait till you see the things that [ __ ] they get themselves into during this movie man it's terrifying other things worse like you had in real life he's like oh my god these are some aliens or whatever the hell they are you do not want to land on this planet oh man and I gotta tell you the movie was not long the movie was not long like it started at 9:00 okay 15 20 minutes of trailers right and I just got out when I looked at my clock when I sat in my car it was 10:45 so it's not a long movie they cut to the point and it's good I'm gonna give it three and a half out of five rules I suggest you all go and see if you enjoyed my movie review hit the like button subscribe and share if you did not you can kiss my there ya timeles subscribe us woo you may now subscribe
