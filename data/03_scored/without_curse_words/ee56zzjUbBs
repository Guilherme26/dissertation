hi everybody my name is Steph Koza and today I'm going to review the shape,0.07421517
of water the shape of water is directed by Guillermo del Toro back at it,0.043615736
again never disappoints and the story is set in the 1960s where a young mute,0.103362076
janitor named Eliza works in a research facility where she discovers this very strange peculiar,0.13824295
mysterious aquatic creature this movie had me hooked from the first trailer just the way,0.15825187
that it looks the style the very weird mysterious vibe that it has I knew,0.09994762
that I wanted to see this movie I just instantly was like that looks awesome,0.16929525
and it's a little bit difficult to describe because it is very strange but it's,0.097129405
essentially like Bioshock Meets The Creature from the Black Lagoon which yes is very weird,0.24265043
but it makes for an amazing movie every shot looks very Bioshock like I love,0.2632902
the feeling of Bioshock I love the way that it looks and it has that,0.07588843
exact same vibe of the 60s very dark and gritty it's nighttime almost the entire,0.08773522
movie because Elijah works the night shift so it's dark with lots of cool tones,0.08281042
lots of that like 1960s mint green teal color everywhere it has a very industrial,0.11234699
feel and there's also a lot of water imagery because this creature is this weird,0.17318924
like Creature from the Black Lagoon thing it's just really cool to watch even if,0.31089434
the plot was terrible it's a beautifully stunning movie but thankfully the plot is far,0.15001605
from the terrible this movie is a very strange unexpected love story between Eliza this,0.09122309
mute janitor and The Creature from the Black Lagoon I think it's a little bit,0.31089434
more than a love story it's about much more than that it's about their connection,0.064558044
rather than their romantic interest in Sally Hawkins performance as this very confident mute girl,0.1532778
is absolutely amazing and very compelling she doesn't say a word for the entire film,0.104128934
but you can understand her feelings and her emotions based on just her facial expressions,0.32526228
in the way that she moves I think this is probably my favorite performance from,0.0735955
both Richard Jenkins and Michael Shannon Shannon is this really malevolent villain who just is,0.40336934
so evil like you just I don't know something about him you just love to,0.6050778
hate him like just love it and Jenkins is sort of like Eliza's best friend,0.5489552
slash father figure who you just kind of want to give him a hug the,0.08263974
entire time Octavia Spencer is also fantastic as always she's amazing and she is another,0.15211758
janitor that Eliza works with she's kind of like her friend slash like caretaker almost,0.15490669
and she's very sassy and I love it the movie toys with the idea of,0.40327916
being an outcast and being an outsider where essentially everybody around you judges you and,0.1510809
I think that's a really relatable concept for almost everyone it's a very relatable movie,0.048481915
despite its very strange plot lines because I think everyone has felt like an outsider,0.118917346
at least some point in their life but when you think about it it's not,0.07842772
just the creature in this movie that's the outsider at first glance yeah the creature,0.24193875
is weird and everyone's like what is this thing we need to do experiments on,0.13453393
it and test it and we can't have any involvement with it because it's this,0.07455071
far away ostracized thing but when you look at the movie a creature isn't the,0.17251144
only outcast we have janitors we have a mute we have an african-american woman we,0.50868845
have a homosexual man we have a Russian guy who kind of just wants to,0.48483047
be an American and the fact that this movie is set in the 60s makes,0.05699235
all of those characters incredibly more ostracized but it turns into this beautiful unexpected love,0.14740795
story between Eliza and the creature and it takes very bold and daring moves there,0.078444906
are a lot of scenes that I would have never expected the kind of toys,0.14990382
with how far it can go and how weird it can get without really feeling,0.09070831
that weird it almost feels like the plot of a old classic film like girl,0.2498875
falls in love with monster it's very like King Kong that kind of thing it's,0.35272768
a very classic idea that hasn't really been brought to light recently but it also,0.0516815
has a very modern twist and it does feel a little weird and a little,0.09942207
off and there are a lot of moments where you're like I don't even what's,0.1621367
happening right now this is very weird but for some reason it feels right and,0.096100174
it doesn't feel as weird as it probably should I don't know maybe it's just,0.10745238
me maybe I just like weird movies but I really liked it I thought it,0.12390277
was really cool I thought it was a very unique movie it's been a while,0.07032392
since I've seen a movie as unique as this one and I loved the theme,0.09582919
behind it I loved all the messages I loved all the acting all the visuals,0.15362479
everything about it was absolutely fantastic because of that I'm going to give it a,0.09570143
4.5 out of 5 I'm knocking down at point five because there were parts that,0.06042957
were a little weird and made me feel kind of uncomfortable I haven't entirely processed,0.12072508
it yet maybe I'll change my mind later there was just a little bit that,0.11862574
I feel could have been turned around or I don't know I don't know poor,0.2541121
bum five out of five that's pretty good I think that's okay so did you,0.41021606
see the shape of water let me know in the comments below what you thought,0.07721055
about it I would love to hear your thoughts thank you guys so much for,0.11205219
