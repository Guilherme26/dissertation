I've been seeing way too many good movies lately I feel like I need to watch some bad ones to balance it out you know I'm not complaining about all the good movies but I feel like my sample pools a little skewed your ghosts let the most is not so slowly becoming one of my favorite directors the lobster blew me away two years ago and ever since I've just been inhaling his work which is why I went and saw the favorite at the New York Film Festival which was its US premiere now technically I didn't see the US premiere that showing was at 6:30 and there was a Q&A with your ghost lamp the most and I think Emma Stone was there I cut a smaller showing with no QA about half an hour later so technically I saw the second u.s. showing of this film and Wow for a period piece I can already tell this film is gonna sweep the technical categories production design costume design hair and makeup all that good stuff it's not just that they were impressive period sets and period costumes because I've kind of come to expect that a proper period piece will already have those I'm probably taking it for granted but that's just an expectation of mine at this point but there are so many little things that cater to the absurd nature of the film stuff like eggplant earrings you know it's all these all these small things that really pushes the film above and beyond typical period piece attire and the sets aside from being impressive Palace sets have such a McCobb Eicher to them which is kind of ironic because the film wasn't nearly as dark as I expected it to be not that I was disappointed by that looking at his last three films the lobster is kind of a balance between seriously dark and comedic Lee dark the killing of a sacred deer has dark comedy but it's mostly serious and then on the other end of the spectrum this film is a comedy not in a bad way though not that the tension is broken by the comedy it's more like phantom thread where it uses comedy to convey it's heavier more serious themes and the tension in this film is still incredibly powerful I don't know how lanthum OHS does it year after year he's been in such command of the films he's released his direction is top-notch this film is a little different he's toned down the monotone delivery which I realize is an ironic but what I mean is the actors convey a lot more emotion in their their dialogue and their mannerisms than in lanthum OSes previous films that said it's still very much a your ghost lanthum of film it's still jam-packed with idiosyncrasies and I think this film is actually a great example of the difference between a quirky film and an idiosyncratic film quirky I think is more of an aesthetic term where is idiosyncratic implies that there is a meaning or theme hidden under all these small things looking at Wes Anderson for instance he's kind of a mixed bag of quirks and idiosyncrasies but I think LAN themost is mostly idiosyncratic although I'd argued that the dialogue in the killing of a sacred deer is quirkier than it is idiosyncratic and just to be clear there's nothing wrong with quirkiness I don't want this to become a thing where like pretentious people use idiosyncratic and only normies use quirky like I don't watch movies I watch films no they're just very similar words with slightly different meanings moving past that digression let the Moe's approach this film with an aesthetic affinity for extremes there are shots with extremely open exposure the highlights just dominating the frame he uses these crazy wide-angle lenses some of which are so extreme you can see both ends of a hallway or a road within the same frame and sometimes he uses these crazy wide-angle lenses and opens the exposure up at the same time the title design pushes the centering of text to its extreme there are even shots that are really dark and have extreme noise that however I found to be a little distracting and I probably would have preferred if you used a little more light and those scenes that said it didn't happen that often and mostly the shots were astonishing even the editing is extreme we have these extreme J&L cuts cuts that begin before the scene is over or carry on after the next scene has begun there were scenes in this film that we hear the audio for as early as the previous scene begins the film is broken up into chapters and the first chapter has a very clear first act structure this whole first act they're just setting up dominoes and as soon as the first chapter ends and we see the title card for the second chapter it's like they put this elaborate domino setup into motion and we see the rivalry but I'm a stone and raychel wisest characters develop and play out I will say that the third act of this film could have been a bit shorter they they dragged out some of the events just a little too much that said I was having such a good time watching this movie that I didn't even mind all that much the very last shot of this movie layers so many different images over each other I feel like the word trippy is probably selling it kind of short there's so much information the film is giving us letting us ponder the conclusion of the film it's it's amazing this is really a perfect companion piece to bury London which also criticizes 18th century English royalty naturally the sets and costumes have a lot of similarities but where Barry Lyndon tried to recreate the era as authentically as possible and have chastised well characters within this authentic setting the favorite in addition to a lot of authenticity portrays this era in a sort of heightened reality layering on a decent amount of absurdism there's a scene where Rachel Liza's character Sarah is dancing with some guy I don't remember if it was Nicholas Hoult or not and the way the dance is framed and lens and the actual choreography of the dance itself is so ridiculous it's like your ghost lanthum oz is physically standing there laughing in the face of 18th century royalty so needless to say this film is far less subtle than Barry Lyndon not that that's a bad thing they're just different ways of approaching the subject matter there's even a scene in this movie that almost directly recreates the recital scene from Barry London the three best performances this year are all in this movie I thought I'm a stone was pretty good in la-la land I didn't think her role was very demanding nor her character all that complex she did as much as she could with it but this is the performance that makes her worthy of being an Academy Award winner she's she's incredible here as is rachel wise and Olivia Colman does such an amazing job taking a character that could very easily be a caricature and breathing so much humanity into her not only are these the three strongest performances but also the three strongest characters I've seen this year they're each so dynamic on their own but as a three-person group the dynamics among each other are so richly layered and complex I haven't seen a pair of characters as diametrically opposed as Abigail and Sarah since there will be blood probably just such a strong understanding of who these people are by everyone working on the film so these two are certainly strong characters opposing each other and then we have Olivia Coleman's character Queen Anne who's in the middle and she's really more of a vehicle or even more so a MacGuffin for these two to fight over that said it's totally unclear which of any of the three of these people are the main character and probably has the most screen time but it's Abigail and Sarah who were battling for her and even then they have equal screen time and development naturally I'd say we want to view Sarah as the protagonist and Abigail is the antagonist but none of these characters are good or bad the film starts out and Sarah's being ruthlessly mean to Anne meanwhile we see Abigail is thrown in the mud she's jerked off - we see her sleeping on the ground she burns her hand she's got this messed-up backstory so immediately we have these associations with the characters but then we see how much of Sarah's rudeness is out of love and we see just how conniving Abigail can be but not all of Sarah's behaviors out of love she's equally as conniving as Abigail and we totally see where abigail is coming from going into this situation so there's a lot of moral ambiguity going on which as you probably know I have a weakness for I can't help but love a good morally ambiguous story as I mentioned each of these characters is acted to perfection I almost feel bad for Nicholas Hoult because he's got a great character and he gives a good performance but he's so out staged by the main three that it's easy to forget he's even in the movie at first I was surprised to find that this was a Fox Searchlight film and not a 24 considering it's your go slant the most and then I found out that your go slant the most didn't write the script for this film which was even more surprising because he's always written his own scripts but even more surprising than that is who the screenwriters are believe me when I tell you that this is the strongest script of the year stronger even than probably any film that came out last year and it was written by two people named Deborah Davis and Toni McNamara this is Davis's only IMDB credit and it looks like McNamara was mostly just a staff writer on some not very popular TV shows he also wrote and directed an Australian film called the rage and placid lake which received mixed reviews as well as a film called Ashby which received less than stellar reviews who are these people and how did they write such a phenomenal script and if they are well-known people then how come I didn't know about them and how come this is Davis's only IMDB credit it makes no sense it doesn't add up I can't I can't wrap my mind around it the script is too good for nobodies to have written it doesn't make sense not only is the character writing in this film god-tier but it's endlessly quotable there's a scene where this guy walks into a begins room and she asks him are you here to seduce me or rape me and he goes I'm a gentleman and she goes so rape it is then that's the kind of humor that's persistent throughout the whole film it's so fresh and biting and there are so many great one-liners like that despite the fact that Lant the most didn't write this script I totally understand why he chose to direct it it's thematically consistent with his other films and here I'm gonna get into a few spoilers so if you don't want to hear go to this time so in the end abigail becomes a lady and Sarah's exiled from England and their final interaction totally changes the way we view this whole dispute Sarah's about to leave and she says to Abigail you really think you've won and Abigail says something like half an eye and Sarah says we're playing very different games now at first I thought this meant that Sarah had some plan to win back ends affection and somehow defeat Abigail but then I realized that no more had to be done I watched the last shot his Abigail is rubbing Anne's legs and their faces are juxtaposed on top of each other as the shots of rabbits layer and layer and then the movie ends my very initial reaction was oh it's over but as the credits rolled the image suddenly made sense or maybe not the image but the ending I realized that that moment was the film's logical conclusion Abigail thought she had won because she was now a lady and thus untouchable was that really what the battle was over what now now that she's a lady keep faking love for the Queen sara has that whole monologue about how she tells Anne when she looks like a badger because she loves her and Anne realizes now that Sarah's been exiled that she must up she lost her love and now she's stuck with Abigail who she now realizes has been using her this whole time and Abigail knows that Anne knows and now they're stuck in this awkward relationship the rabbits serving as a constant reminder of Abigail's fake love and this is the game that Sarah was talking about and really Sarah won because she's still the one that Queen Anne loves and Abigail may be a lady now but that doesn't mean anything other than a better bed to sleep in better clothes to wear and better food to eat which is heartbreaking but you realize that Abigail put herself in this position by using the Queen and it's just such a beautiful conclusion juggling so many different contradictory feelings the direction and performances are great in this movie but it's really the script above everything else that impressed me here's my prediction and there are many films I haven't seen yet this year this film is gonna win best production design and best costume design your ghost lanthum host will be nominated for Best Director Robbie Ryan will be nominated for Best Cinematography the film will be nominated for best hair and makeup and best film editing nicholas hoult will be nominated for Best Supporting Actor any of these three actresses hopefully all three of them will be nominated for Best Lead Actress one of them will win if any of them are nominated for Best Supporting Actress she will win the film will be nominated for Best Picture now awards are arbitrary but I do believe that there's somewhat important in recognizing talented artists and while lanthum OHS has been snubbed in the past the Academy has a certain affection for period pieces and I think this will be the lanthum OHS film to catch their attention for me it's a super super super strong 9 out of 10 but I'd like to watch it a few more times before I can confidently decide whether or not it's worthy of being a 10 out of 10 it's a very close second to the lobster but all of his films are so good it's really hard to compare see this movie if not for yourself then for me and if you have seen it then let me know what you think in the comments thank you for watching and I'll see you next time you
