welcome to golfing comments today we're going to review the movie inside out this is a newer pixar movie but not really that new i mean it came out in 2015 so it's not like the newest movie out there but still for me for me growing up i watched a lot of pixar a lot of disney when i was you know yay high when i was five ten twelve-ish that's how i stopped watching disney movies i mean i watched kind of something from the old i haven't seen too many of the newer disney or pixar movies i think was the last new movie that like i kind of watched cocoa watch too a couple years ago um and that was good that was great too but for me for the most part i've only watched too many pixar movies disney movies i guess i'm getting older maybe i need to watch some more movies to keep that child-like faith and and keep you know my my inner youth innocence uh bottled in i guess i don't know whenever i watch a movie i i initially get the overall picture of what this movie is well i'm always trying to figure out like where it's going with this like what's the plot to structure to this movie what's going on with it so i saw inside out i'm like okay you're talking about the emotions that you deal with on the inside where are you going with this story right and so as i watched it the way unraveled i'm like this is great you have to what i got from this movie is sometimes you have to embrace sadness to experience true joy life's not always going to be joyful and the main character is trying to keep life just straight joyful there's no problems there's no sadness ever but sometimes you know they're the emotions that you experience are all mixed together to be able to create your personality your life things have to you're going to go through stuff you're going to go through different things life's going to hit you're going to hit some heart breaks um and it's just life and then all that combined all the emotions combined make up true joy true true your true personality embracing all your emotions together creates true happiness i guess you could say that overall you have to leave a 7-4 so really good kids movie really good movie period but really good kids moving watch it lemonade thoughts if you've seen it tell me what you think about it thanks for tuning in to this episode of coffee and comments
