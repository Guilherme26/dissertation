leaves it as an odd last scene with several shots cross spinning into each other,0.15135722
not being aware of your girl utmost style of filmmaking I was taken by surprise,0.25327393
a minute i sat down in the cinema expecting a funny period drama with astonishing,0.07520234
Olivia Colman backed by Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz I was instead given a dark,0.017221605
and twisted dramatic comedy and the struggle and fight between stone and Weiss's characters as,0.057702687
they aim to please Queen Anne played by Olivia Colman and becoming her favorite you,0.056756794

the story didn't wasn't really fleshed out in any way I didn't really understand maybe,0.017296106
it was just above my level of understanding it just left me wondering what the,0.019153964
heck I just spent two like hours of watching I did read a review on,0.16831075
Rotten Tomatoes and someone said it was like smoking a Jurgis lung tumors joint and,0.18242927
you're just like hi for about two hours not really sure what's going on and,0.060584262
that's pretty much what I felt the minute like the credits started rolling same time,0.04470899
even though I was completely confused and actually just like what did I just watch,0.022321567
I was also very astonished by the non-commercial take on period dramas the way that,0.02940777
this film just come plays out it's very different to any other pure drama which,0.061429046
kind of interested me and made me more interested in looking into more of yoga,0.08287856
slant sinners films and now that I'm more aware of his style of filmmaking I'm,0.207669
gonna be less surprised and less weirded out about what the hell is happening and,0.2662663
watching that film The Last of Us uses extreme humor which a liver Coleman is,0.029131718

well laughter Moses we really really odd fish I shot and hiring a loud sound,0.17652777
track to create one of the oddest but most fascinating films I've ever seen the,0.036986206
acting is probably the best thing and the what stood out the most to me,0.03300109
throughout this film and Coleman and amis own are comedic geniuses I just loved Emma,0.059752118
Stone in general like I'm a big fan of her I've been a big fan,0.068422124
of her since like easy a Crazy Stupid Love so like a good couple of,0.43757316
five six seven years yeah she's just incredible and Olivia Colman is someone who's like,0.092537686
come into my life recently and I'm quite excited to see what she can do,0.14948672
with the cream in the crown because that it's got a completely different role to,0.026903352
you like what I've seen her doing before because it's a very serious the queen,0.09710018
is very very different to what she is usually like Olivia Colman and of course,0.065910384
Rachel Weisz is probably one of the most amazing and underrated actresses that we have,0.023556814
and I'm very excited to see more of her because once I watch the film,0.04202231
I can get a little bit obsessed with people and I start watching like all,0.21462017
over their films and I think a Rachel Weisz is the one I'm gonna go,0.056015115
into next and just watch pretty much all of our films because some of them,0.064337224
are pretty freakin amazing I just feel that together these three my like million actresses,0.20301537
they kind of like tie it together because even though I don't feel that the,0.036393527
film is completely fleshed out either through it's like comedic side or it's dramatic side,0.04241078
I just feel that the actors kind of just like take it and run with,0.04540344
it and manage to like create something really really good especially Emma Stone a little,0.050774135
bit comb and I'm just a genius is that the comedic side and then Rachel,0.0776695
Weisz just comes in with a dramatic and the really really intense and really really,0.024321774
sassy and she's just like together and they're just like really really good but in,0.27459633
general like the film in general to me just felt - I was too aware,0.017327368
that I was watching the fit when I was too aware that was science and,0.020280119
watching the screen with this drama played out and it didn't really feel real I,0.019004297
like when you get like completely engrossed in the film and you can't forget that,0.016541122
you're watching something and you just like imagine yourself but this is actually playing out,0.100711465
in front of you and it's not just a film I just feel that with,0.057547033
the really loud those really really loud music like really really hard by beating or,0.13643914
like slamming of string instruments of piano and it's very Howlin very very loud and,0.18748666
that along law the fisheye lenses and the fisheye shots it just kind of takes,0.044667747
away from the experience of being engrossed in a film and you're just very very,0.07328727
aware that you are in the cinema watching you film and there's people around you,0.03367825
and I didn't really get that I didn't really get sucked into the film which,0.24040858
is something I love about go to the cinemas and just like sit there two,0.03098625
hours and yet completely sucked in to film but with the favorite I just never,0.19933225
really felt that it was I was just constantly thinking what the heck is going,0.20038325
on I do not really understand this and I was just constantly confused to be,0.03131751
honest I just think that to enjoy the favor like I watched the trailer and,0.032288678
it looked hilarious but once I was in the cinema and watched like the films,0.064485565
playing out there were any real light laugh-out-loud moments because the funny moments had already,0.03192682
been in the trailer and I hate when they do that I hate when like,0.05021338
all the fun bits or all the like iconic bits are in the trailer doesn't,0.039710134
really lead you into like getting anything else when you actually watch the film and,0.035379786
I think to be able to enjoy it you cannot go in there expecting a,0.051675458
funny period drama it's a completely different stories it's a completely different genre and lanten,0.039956916
was just like takes period drama and just like deconstruct it and just makes it,0.026137726
a new thing so it's literally just it looks like a period drama but it's,0.032200877
got none of the same tones and it's just a very odd piece of cinema,0.035556063
isn't it in general I was just left with utter confusion battle by the odd,0.0140526695
film that I had just witnessed and I also I was like sat there as,0.022291634
the credits started rolling as like these file shots for just like merging into each,0.09921214
other and I was just thinking what did I what what happened how did it,0.028764537
end I didn't really like it took me a while I had to like really,0.026578743
think about it to realize to understand how it ended but it was oops my,0.051783215
hair is all crazy it was an odd experience I just like me my friend,0.14034177
just kind of just looked at each other just laughing like what the hell does,0.28611207
not I feel but I put on my would watch journalist I probably never would,0.08233843
watch that but I am and she to watch lobster and also killing your secret,0.53400207
dear the lobster looks incredible it looks really really good but yeah with us being,0.029379167
in award season the Golden Globes just passed and I didn't actually watch the Globes,0.013887704
I was too I hadn't even watched any of the films or the TV shows,0.044422958
so I just didn't feel it was worth staying up until 5:00 a.m. to watch,0.020755725
the globe's but being in the word season this film was nominated five Golden Globes,0.03376206
and I do believe it's gonna pick up a couple of nominations both in the,0.02401313
sags and at the Oscars I don't think it's worth winning maybe like the performances,0.059402894
both Olivia Colman and Emma Stone are incredible in it I think Olivia Colman will,0.08332423
be picking up a couple of nomination don't really feel like it's the strongest for,0.022859702
performances of the ones I've seen so far and the film in general isn't not,0.012083061
strong and if you compare it to all the other films so definitely better films,0.038030546
that came out last year that deserve to win and deserve the nomination and that's,0.08564173
just my take on it I know a lot of like proper like film geeks,0.06119224
and film cinema files and all of those people probably enjoyed it but this was,0.019116048
just a little bit too far above my level of interest I'm usually not a,0.053440187
big fan of period dramas but this look we need to be funny and it,0.04563226
looked interesting but once I was in that cinema it didn't live up to my,0.054900933
expectations and it was on the best a film I've ever seen but yeah that,0.027759444
is my little review that's my take on a favorite this is the first video,0.034668706
