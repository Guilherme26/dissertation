hey everybody today I'm going to be reviewing the black Klansmen this film is directed,0.20605327
by Spike Lee Spike Lee is somebody that is very famous of course some I,0.029073182
say infamous he's known for being a very outspoken auteur artists as well as an,0.12908354
activist he's made a career out of making very socially and politically charged films and,0.04849854
you have to admit whether you love it or you hate him he is never,0.2361132
boring for the most part a lot of the things he does whether he falls,0.07444004
flat on his face or he excels is he does it with gusto and he,0.28010798
does it with a lot of passion which you you have to admire he is,0.054675434
extremely hit or miss with me there are times when I watch some of his,0.22532536
films like 25th hour for example it's one of my favorite movies ever or do,0.027160779
the right thing another classic one of the great masterpieces he ever made I watched,0.06921635
those and I just like want to kiss him on the forehead and just praise,0.38196036
him for these these wonderful works that he's given us and then at other times,0.036719467
I just want to be like you and that's how I feel about a lot,0.044658434
of things he's done in recent years but I had heard good things about black,0.16011968
Klansmen so you know I actually was interested this is based on a true story,0.017573487
that occurred in the 1970s in the Colorado Police Department Roth stallworth is the main,0.010860453
character and he is a black man who ends up becoming the first black police,0.4870521
officer in the police department first investigator and they of course referred to him as,0.053735532
the Jackie Robinson of the police department and one day he comes across an advertisement,0.059760764
in the newspaper for the Ku Klux Klan so he just on a whim calls,0.13635
the number and pretends to be a white man who wants to join and become,0.15489732
a member he does so because I mean it's a promising lead and he needs,0.05877097
something that's bold and something to get him noticed and maybe he could get some,0.036686875
good Intel along the way and he does a really good job but the one,0.023879427
problem is at the very end he has a slip he makes a mistake and,0.10255402
he actually gives his real name Ron stallworth naturally that's an issue so one of,0.028183166
his colleagues Adam driver poses as the the white version of Ron Stallworth as they,0.06413235
try to basically work from the inside out exposing the KKK for me the idea,0.18827425
of identity is very prominent theme throughout the movie and even with within this particular,0.021782769
story you've got both characters the Adam driver character and and the the Washington character,0.021025125
they both have the name Ron stallworth their identities are always up in the air,0.026528854
always in question and it's kind of asking what does your identity say about you,0.035775572
in relation to the society that you live in like for instance Ron talks about,0.07907836
being able to speak like a white man when he needs to but he can,0.24244115
also speak jive he knows that because certain parts of society expect him to be,0.058302682
one way and another side expects him to be another and how do you change,0.021736871
accordingly even with Adam driver he is playing a Jewish man in this movie he's,0.23130718
he's pretending that he's not Jewish you have multiple points of view going on in,0.28219402
this movie and there is a lot of stereotyping and kind of cartoonish portrayals of,0.052736424
the different types of characters but I will say I think that there's a lot,0.02160583
of truth in it as well having a black man working from inside the KKK,0.41158554
is of course a really compelling idea but even just the idea that a black,0.2540167
man the only black man in the police force is working within the department this,0.35592443
is brought up to him saying that you are a police officer you are betraying,0.26734737
your own people for being a pig as they say a pig or a cop,0.4792901
so we've been using that kind of rhetoric against cops you know they they are,0.050128903
real people too even though they do have a bit of a reputation at times,0.05239186
and in the film there is a character that kind of represents that he's like,0.014365306
that one bad cop or that that racist cop but the rest of the cuffs,0.28600475
defend him because ultimately they're a family and they have to stick together and you,0.061852768
can kind of understand why they do that they have their own family that they've,0.039166678
worked to build just like the Klan members have their own family just like the,0.102696374
black activists are their own family so everybody has their reasons for why they're defending,0.3301213
themselves and if I'm gonna quote rules of the game yet again this movie has,0.033012398
a really frenzied quality to it but my favorite scenes tend to be the more,0.012357117
quiet scenes I know shocker there but yeah my favorite scene honestly it's a very,0.030398892
small one and not necessarily that important but it's worth flip or the the Adam,0.029661205
driver character is talking about his Jewish identity and he talks about how you know,0.16170083
it never meant anything to him really it he didn't use it as something that,0.02669914
to define him until the moment he is harassed by a Klan member who's trying,0.2553997
to get him to prove that he's not Jewish and now all of a sudden,0.39692876
it's all that he can think about his Jewish identity it's a really quiet moment,0.31847075
it's a really reflective moment and I think an intelligent one of a poignant one,0.09446539
I like the juxtaposition between all the chaos and then the column and I do,0.11422733
think that this movie I like that it's as ambitious as it is as I,0.058577403
said there is a lot going on it is messy at times but with Spike,0.06410774
Lee I don't sometimes I'm able to excuse the messiness like I don't think that,0.03502458
that necessarily detract from it for some reason that just kind of contributes to the,0.031966064
authenticity of the work a lot of the time he's using a lot of subgenres,0.09494632
staples like blaxploitation tropes and things like that and all of that just it has,0.11431048
a certain quality to it it's got kind of a funky and cool sort of,0.20486592
thing but at times cheap as well those kinds of films they are culturally distinct,0.03774851
and I think that he kind of wants the same thing with his own films,0.12250288
and this is after all a pastiche work so he's using a lot of different,0.035163604
film clips as well especially ones from like old movies old Hollywood movie such as,0.039195947
Gone with the Wind and lots of clips from clips from Birth of a Nation,0.060739916
and he does very strange things like he adds weird sound effects and weird voiceovers,0.06026231
to them that definitely were not there originally I think he just wants you to,0.05144131
always be aware that you are watching a movie when you watch this particular film,0.064588666
because movies film is an extremely powerful medium I think it's a lot more powerful,0.052726448
than people give it credit for the way that you view people is often personified,0.022248397
in the art that you're creating the way people are treated the way people are,0.027285168
portrayed I think it says a lot about how society feels about these sorts of,0.048215173
people's in ways that they feel like they can disguise under the the kind of,0.0384383
the masks of entertainment a film like Birth of a Nation for instance is a,0.07875508
very important film a controversial one but just important in terms of film history and,0.012952456
you know it also is kind of known for helping to revive the the Ku,0.022147955
Klux Klan but at the same time I mean there is something to be said,0.2338697
for the film I mean for those of you who have seen it you know,0.04935596
it's it's an incredible piece of work very very very ambitious he's very aware of,0.045083486
these cultural effects and so he wants to make a movie that is very accessible,0.042441376
and one that is just on a basic level entertaining like this one is it's,0.025142612
very funny it's got attitude and energy and it's got a theatrical quality to it,0.043603454
as well and it's accessibility is part of its appeal so he can convey his,0.05097768
perspective through that palatability I have to say I thought that I mean there's a,0.024338404
lot of very funny performances in this movie but Topher Grace was wonderful as David,0.03137738
Duke and I never thought I would say that about Topher Grace and I also,0.14469407
never thought I'd see Topher Grace playing David Duke he is so deadpan and in,0.22951713
his delivery in this movie and part of that is very very humorous but also,0.035719696
eerie and especially what he's talking about the rhetoric he's using but how that's contrasted,0.027444812
with this kind of matter-of-fact way speaking it's a really good performance and a lot,0.035502847
of the performance is as hammy as they are worked for me in this context,0.03858531
and again it's it's all just part of Leigh's style which has always been very,0.018812723
just in-your-face yeah I did say that this movie is a little bit all over,0.10298706
the place at times and I think that it could have done with a little,0.020997187
bit more focus here in there but at the same time the frenzied nature of,0.038458258
it kind of contributes to the overall feeling because this is a movie that is,0.023129765
about chaos about racism in a very divided world I wasn't too keen about how,0.100048274
they ended this movie I feel like it kind of fizzles and we're left with,0.051697407
footage that's coming from the modern day basically and I I don't know something about,0.0750081
that rubs me the wrong way I don't know if I feel like it was,0.08151759
necessary on one hand it does feel a little bit on the nose and it,0.0830229
feels preachy but on the other hand it does contribute to that whole pastiche filmmaking,0.028190482
that I mentioned adding the information from the modern day but I don't know I,0.025042169
just wish it came together a little bit more gracefully in a more kind of,0.080031574
clean manner but you know I gotta say when I when I watched the movie,0.033802636
at first I didn't know how I felt about it walking out I didn't really,0.03000843
feel like talking about it I just kind of wanted to let the the juices,0.03133414
marinate up here a little bit and it took almost 24 hours before I kind,0.17994748
of started think you know I this movie won me over the more I thought,0.026465662
about it the more I think I I actually really liked it it's definitely one,0.046058647
of Lee's better movies that he's made in a long time for wants to see,0.035072472
him have that energy that he used to have is really nice for me this,0.038228106
is one of the better movies that he's made in a long time the one,0.052804273
thing that I've always loved and admired about him is that he's he is so,0.05997695
bold he is so confident in his style and that color and all that passion,0.1282401
just radiates from him and I just feel like the lights have dimmed for a,0.038773555
long time so to see this kind of this this movie kind of pop the,0.05955123
way that it does just kind of invigorated me it gave me hope for Spike,0.14764549
Lee and that's my review thank you all for listening all my social media informations,0.023858806
