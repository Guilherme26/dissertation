figured now because anytime than ever I'm gonna be looking at the cabinet of dr.,0.019048864
Caligari this movie came out in 1920 and I'm attack as you as I as,0.22507988
you can tell it'll be celebrating its 100th anniversary next year now this movie is,0.010968213
significant in a lot of ways to meet on a personal level it's actually the,0.02189718
first silent movie that I ever saw now I must have been in middle school,0.035760272
when I first saw that I was just channel surfing one day and I turned,0.029977832
onto a local PBS or Public Broadcasting assistant station my father I was about 10,0.024251265
minutes into it and I was hooked right up until the end I mean I,0.07841717
had heard of silent movies and even my mom had a book that had stills,0.070426986
from my family the Opera and way down east and a bunch of other but,0.077897
it never clicked with me that these movies were silent with just you know music,0.050430898
and title cards and everything until I actually saw one of these movies so I'm,0.036626343
not quite sure why it held my attention at such a young age I don't,0.08279807
know if it the imagery or the suspense of this movie or the fact that,0.028132612
I was actually watching a silent movie for the first time I don't know the,0.03889462
captain of dr. Caligari is a German a psychological and thought provoking silent film about,0.17264575
Francis he's a young man who visits a travelling fair that just arrived in his,0.01398216
hometown he visits it with his friend Helen and while there they see this sideshow,0.038345177
staged for a hypnotist named dr. Caligari played by Warner Krauss and his act is,0.05267523
basically he has a Sonam beuliss which is a sleepwalker named Caesar he's played by,0.053764135
conrad veidt and wakes caesar up and he can tell your future and any other,0.060651444
questions that you might have but at night Caligari uses him to commit murders what,0.25053537
is striking about this movie is of course the visual look of this film the,0.03878287
sets the makeup the costumes are done to reflect the madness of the mind of,0.06347116
the person telling the story using art directors from Germans film expressionist movement it has,0.019604292
a very dark and twisted visual style of you know the sets and both indoors,0.1045376
and outdoors are twisted they are slanted or misshapen the chairs are very high shadows,0.07457041
are painted on the sets along the walls the floors that you know all kinds,0.019326245
of places with the performances I thought that both Krause and I gave very chilling,0.07012965
performances as Caligari and Caesar especially you know just from their movements and even their,0.021548625
facial expressions especially when Caligari has Caesar awake for the first time now some say,0.066368036
that the acting may be over-the-top but keep in mind you know that these actors,0.024930418
had to convey emotions visually and since these films are closer to be shown to,0.015871283
different countries with different languages everybody can understand a feeling or doing it visually the,0.042571086
movie itself I've seen it quite a number of times and it always keeps me,0.023053935
on the edge of my seat and always keeps me guessing and then has twists,0.026100475
and turns that you may not see coming and although I see this movie more,0.08134797
as a horror movie some have made the argument that this is actually an anti,0.04498637
Authority film with dr. Karl Caligari representing the German war government and Caesar represents the,0.13312387
conditioned Man like soldiers are trained basically to kill which kind of makes sense the,0.18666184
census movie did come out at the end of World War 1 and I found,0.095997974
out that the writers of the movie were actually passing this now what could be,0.019627573
said about this movie that hasn't already been said it's been called the first horror,0.067661814
film it's been called the first arthouse film you can definitely sense its influence in,0.025928194
horror movies especially with the universal monster movies that came out in the 1930s and,0.12859929
the 1940s like for example terrible things will happen if you visit a traveling fair,0.061594676
like you see in murder and rude morgue with Bela Lugosi or the Wolfman with,0.41823897
Lon Chaney jr. the wooden box that the pale and darkly dressed Caesar lays and,0.07272519
kind of reminds me of Dracula with Bela Lugosi or when Caesar is lovestruck with,0.038973775
the leading lady of the film instead of killing her he abducts her kind of,0.6755815
like Frankenstein with Boris Karloff and of course you know I can see how this,0.057623528
this influenced him burned with some of his work as well I think the cabinet,0.1673642
of dr. Caligari is a must-see movie for all kinds of movie audiences including not,0.021318471
only silent films but horror mystery suspense and even thought-provoking and complex art house movies,0.0440611
I think that for movie that soon to be a hundred years old it still,0.031030817
packs a very scary and chilling pun the visuals are great the performances are great,0.0439866
I think that this movie is still compelling all right well that's my take on,0.043067314
