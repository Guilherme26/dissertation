hi everyone,0.04587934
so today,0.035103906
I'm going to be talking about moonlight,0.11170796
and even though I did see my life back in cinemas when it came out in 2016,0.10986449
I've never really reviewed it,0.09113005
and maybe it's just because I couldn't really think of anything to say that hasn't been said already maybe it's because I've wanted to give it some time to mull over before summarizing my thoughts on it up.maybe said a few more times or in a more ordinary night,0.110038295
maybe,0.038781885
it's just simply because I wasn't in the swing of film reviewing at the time as I tend to be a bit on and off with the old consistent film reviewing unfortunately nonetheless here are my thoughts on moonlight and as a disclaimer this is just what I personally took away from the film it is a very ambiguous interpretive film,0.0907289
and none of what I'm about to say is cut and dry objective and factual it's just my opinions,0.062356196
and you may completely disagree that's perfectly fine because difference of opinion is a wonderful thing,0.06157747
but when white stars trivanti roads Ashton Sanders Alex I hit Andre Holland Janelle Monae Naomi Harris and Hershel alley and destructed by Barry Jenkins the film that tells us the story of chiraq played by three different actors throughout it starts off of ten-year-old sharone played by Alex I habits then teenage Sharon played by Ashland Sanders and then played 20 year old sharone played by Tremonti Rhodes and this sort of makes up the three-act structure for the film if you will it's about him growing up trying to find his place in the world fit in connect with others,0.050779767
and just be himself in Liberty City in Miami starting off in the 1980s up until now with crime poverty masculinity and homophobia tend to rule the streets my initial reaction was watching a film was a consistent level of adoration,0.31885603
but it was as it finished and I went to the bathroom and I thought back on some of the slow quiet scenes that I had to fight to literally stop myself bursting into tears and days and weeks later thinking back and some of the slow quiet moments and character reviews I still found myself just tearing up big time even crying a film that can have that kind of lasting effect on you is one that must dr.,0.082137786
that I've now seen it three times and can safely say it's one of my all-time favorite movies it's some really movie with big dramatic swelling scenes it's a size of life and a story that feels so real and war it's so vibrant and beautiful in terms of the color lighting music performances the dialogue feels so honest and real and natural in terms of how people actually interact and it's not a film that needs to try and insist upon allow you begin except its scope and scale every gravitas it's a film which slowly arose under your skin into your soul and only Barack's Everdene for post viewers it's a family to get you on accualy empathetic,0.18852426
level and watching it is like having one of those really vivid and realistic dreams with when you wake up from it's sort of good Wow and you instantly just want to go back and see where the durability anyone who's ever considered themselves introverted or as found a hard fitting in or being yourself moon life should and will get you right,0.1564779
there in the fields you'll find it,0.071384005
you're faced with no choice that was placed right into the shoes of sharone feel what he feels and connect with him on it on a level few films and ever G as mentioned before the lighting is spectacularly vibrant the rich blues purples even golds at times I'd just divine even when it isn't literally lit or filtered attempted using these colors it genuinely always as a feel of a warm summer's night at the beach under the moonlight,0.10418577
I can't even remember a film which truly has you feeling as though you're physically there to the point where you can smell the salty sweaty but somehow comforting aromas of Liberty City Miami by the seaside the way they carry swirls and sways,0.11076963
particularly in the very opening scene and during a disturbing bullying scene feels so epic a wedeck and graceful the character won't play that magnificently by moshe ali is for a good portion of the film the only character who seems to offer show roman kindness and warmth and someone for shyrone to look up to is however a drug dealer who is regularly involved in the streets and is ultimately the one selling crack to sharona's abusive mother also played brilliantly by Naomi Harris so in a way the angelic one is partly the root of Sharon's problems,0.10083467
the fact that it is an old black cast,0.31089434
and the Shire owners gave a game pretty much relevant to the point that I basically forgot about those elements or worked in the film what really set in,0.048815068
and what I really took away from a know Universal things belonging and being yourself,0.101338126
and just then to connect with others regardless of race or sexuality it's a film about boys and men and boys becoming men without being masculine on March or bloke and it's a film about being gay without being effeminate or seeming to push forth a much needed contrived agenda,0.32046512
if not clear enough already moonlight is a film that I would highly recommend seeing if you haven't already or if you have seen Anna branch wasn't your cup of tea,0.108698204
I'd encourage giving it a second try and maybe try approached ahead like as an epic Best Picture winner that will no doubt blow you away with scope scale the morbid quiet character study that might just turn into a soul if your letter some have describes moonlight is simply depressing and sad but I don't see it that way at all,0.17708708
but I said as a film filled with hope and encouragement that it's okay as long as you're not hurting yourself or others to to just be yourself be yourself and be proud of it,0.24201693
