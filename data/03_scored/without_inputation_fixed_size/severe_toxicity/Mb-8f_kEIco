hey what's gonna have the YouTube this is SEL zero t20 zjv I swam back,0.060761865
here again for another review I told you I was making a slew of reviews,0.05138211
throughout this week because I am trying to get down and narrow down to my,0.06818931
top 10 list I just finished watching moonlight this is a movie by Barry Jenkins,0.04886572
I don't know if the beer drink is actually wrote it and directed I believe,0.028680058
he did do the screenplay but this was a masterfully directed film I do know,0.050988987
that Naomi Harris who plays chyrons mother when it's named Paula she's the mother of,0.058999795
this and then Marsala Ally both of them got nominated for Golden Globe nominations I,0.021471463
was very curious to see you know the depths of their their very much so,0.021653723
well acclaimed I guess roles in this but the ones this handed out for me,0.06847933
was you know all the different actors that play chyron trivanti did an amazing job,0.037575558
as the older version of Iran and in his element and kind of gone through,0.03689175
the circumstances of everything and as well as Andre Holland which Kevin and Sharon have,0.04195579
an interest in history the reason why Tron goes by the alias of black is,0.032262072
because he called him that then I believe what was the other guy's name I,0.029854773
think it was a Sean Ashton Sanders who plays the middle version of chyron did,0.03384787
amazing long story short they all did an amazing job with their performance as this,0.056134183
man cared because the character unlike normal conventional films is very conflicted I mean he's,0.05616212
dealing with poverty he's dealing with the mother there's got a substance abuse issues it,0.064691104
comes in to addiction that becomes into just a life altering situation where he doesn't,0.028825069
know when he's gonna live or stay and his mother is just so unstable that,0.2123519
is heart-wrenching to actually really watch because that happens all the time I mean like,0.019798527
depending on where you grew up you know I'm saying like you would see something,0.027981615
like this and this is the thing about the film and what I have to,0.013249128
give credits do for Barry Jenkins this does not feel like a film this like,0.032317948
talking about like a random book story this seems like they went straight up you,0.08112713
know I'm saying to a specific location and just film the life of a person,0.08454551
this is what I mean a lot of people love boyhood I love boyhood but,0.06302482
this takes boyhood and goes here you can't see my hand because this like the,0.08952374
actors commit to the environment I think it's a place in the 1980s if I'm,0.06363546
not mistaken but they commit to it like it's so believable the dialogue the personas,0.049713165
the environment it's like I mean like I don't even know how the actors were,0.060821068
able to commit that well and that's the thing even the cinematography it adds more,0.029443689
immersion in a lot of different ways where like you might have like you know,0.057293598
chyron has a young adult he's just getting chased down the block and you don't,0.14168811
know where he's gonna go and just feel scary you know and then when he,0.06860704
is an adult and you know you know I'm saying like he's a big dude,0.132615
now like who's gonna really get some you know but he's got all its insecurities,0.032667167
in himself he's tormented in his mind and the biggest thing about this movie this,0.059210658
the underlying theme that I haven't brought brought up at all is the fact that,0.024659023
this is very much so dealing with homosexuality and homophobia homosexuality in the sense that,0.36743084
Iran is a character that that is something that he's from know what age was,0.03553278
maybe 8 or 9 like his mother was really teetering him with the prospect of,0.10056313
that and then this one random guy who plays volley of one decides to be,0.04622228
his surrogate father in the midst of his adolescence of understanding who he is and,0.033587117
that's where Ali does an amazing job like he is an amazing surrogate father he's,0.031338796
not the father but he's an amazing surrogate father and her as a mom she's,0.18399711
just a total opposite I was this like but there are the thing about it,0.050690986
there's certain things that happen with those two characters that I didn't expect towards the,0.012465541
middle of John's life everything shifts where things just get completely worse that's how it,0.030028386
is well high school no matter what it's like that's where the the moments will,0.03871635
break you or forge you through the fire essential and he went unfortunately through both,0.18542926
where's his mother she just was gone and then on top of that wand was,0.16248374
gone and it was like dang what is he gonna become you know and his,0.07281765
is interesting back and forth with this character Kevin especially in the middle part it,0.012867313
was like something terrible happened and it put him on his platform whereas like he's,0.08073068
just a pitfall essentially you know and he becomes honestly what one was even though,0.026448367
Wang was a good father and stuff like that so I could father he was,0.04970385
a drug dealer and there's consequences with that lifestyle that you lead and this film,0.14780381
does not end you know and the happiest of the lucky ways but going back,0.035569366
to the aspect of homosexuality in sense with chyron he not that he hated himself,0.3809146
but he did not know how to you know make it through this situation cuz,0.029994462
he didn't have mom so he doesn't have anybody it was like from jump like,0.061470952
people were just ready to attack him you know and you know I think Wan,0.6792559
knew that his mother knew that they didn't know how he was gonna make it,0.0652319
you know but he did he had to go through these circumstances that platform them,0.021547958
into this next this next level as a man and it's very it's very deep,0.17644262
it's a rough film it's a rough though I mean I think that for people,0.12643212
that deal with worrying or a little slight homophobia there are some very explicit scenes,0.11324619
there's some scenes there was a slight you know but the thing about it they,0.015615852
don't this is the thing this is the this is the quintessential thing to I,0.033491995
respect about this film is that there are there's a lot underlying theme of you,0.03918863
know the the understanding of his own homosexuality his sexuality as understanding as being a,0.24840885
man very much so and where they could have taken a lot of gory scenes,0.10279016
or not grotesque or sensual scenes of having like sex all over the place and,0.46536568
everything with different people you know and they didn't do that they use tact they,0.02694659
use very well placed in a Matar fee to not even show necessarily any nudity,0.10983379
but it was very much so things that are implied and that's where I said,0.017302757
there's a warning there but I respect the director and the way that they crafted,0.048747983
this film there is no nudity like the scenes that show the sensual connection or,0.08968604
chemistry between like Kevin or chyron or other people are all done through scenes through,0.021869907
acting there's just one specific scene which I run and Kevin when they're adults in,0.024171444
the diner or even when they're in a car and you could tell there were,0.051380116
some definite little emotional triggers that were happening whereas they could have kind of just,0.041260675
like made it really uncomfortable and cringe-worthy they just decided to commit to it from,0.09447005
dialogue and through eye contact and through nuances of confusion it's like you get to,0.08749427
see ty run out of his element in in his element and knowing himself as,0.092278264
an adult and not knowing what he's gonna become and there's very interesting ride very,0.053874552
well executed film ten out of ten yeah it's not a film you can sit,0.105572626
there and watch over and over again though because it's very heavy but definitely one,0.03854074
of the better films I've seen this year so the last film I got to,0.019779235
check out be probably man chest about to see or hex or ridge I don't,0.061189577
know if I can stomach hex or Ridge tonight and Manchester by sea I've heard,0.03749973
it's very depressing so I might just kind of cut in for tonight but hopefully,0.26868433
y'all did enjoy my review for moonlight keep it alive JV I swear you'll stop,0.22381534
