arrival is directed by denis villeneuve the director of prisoners Sicario and enemy his films,0.1540916
over the past few years have all been on my top 10 lists so I,0.06375889
was obviously very excited for arrival and this film stars Amy Adams Jeremy Renner and,0.08711733
Forest Whitaker and is the story of aliens that have come down to earth they've,0.19364628
landed in ships no one knows what they want so they send Amy Adams a,0.07498009
renowned linguist to try to communicate with these aliens are they hostile are they peaceful,0.31247303
what did they want why are they here and this movie was getting an absurd,0.25846055
amount of buzz all positive it had like a 100% for a really long time,0.06811569
I actually saw this movie on Monday at a screening and I waited this long,0.06941896
to review it because I really needed to process it more I felt it was,0.04876869
going to be a mistake if I just jumped in front of the camera and,0.23092051
gave you my immediate thoughts because the film really messes with your mind a lot,0.25712895
and when you get to the third act it makes you rethink the rest of,0.05791007
the movie and I really needed to process this film think about it before I,0.09075767
jumped in front of the camera so that's why I waited this long to review,0.18390593
it first off this is a gorgeously directed movie if you've seen any of Danny's,0.095432304
films you expected that the cinematography here is some of the best of the year,0.055288307
particularly the shot in which we first truly see the alien aircraft it's this incredible,0.13450497
long take encompassing the entire area this thing has landed in there's fog surrounding it,0.08158949
it's jaw-dropping and he does such a good job of setting up tension in the,0.117034465
first act with this character you learn of her very tortured past and as these,0.3623412
things start to land around the world you see news reports and it's very reminiscent,0.062654346
of signs another very good alien invasion film that you guys probably know I really,0.1878102
like there's that sense of panic and paranoia you're wondering exactly what's happening here are,0.11437434
they hostile are they peaceful is this gonna be War of the Worlds or Close,0.32671884
Encounters of the Third Kind and that first act does set up a lot of,0.061821494
tension it also sets up a great character and Amy Adams because this is one,0.051484477
of the best performances I've seen from her the entire film really rests on her,0.15160124
shoulders and her bizarre unconventional character progression it's a very different way of telling a,0.10320936
story once you understand the way certain things are going in the background and if,0.034114107
you're paying attention from seeing one it's gonna make sense to you no I don't,0.10951799
want to get into spoilers in this review I think that people should go into,0.18275568
this movie as blind as possible the reason I wanted to think about it more,0.15366791
though is because I wanted to tell if certain things really added up in my,0.05170098
mind and if things made as much sense as I thought they did while I,0.08866518
was watching the movie because at first when I left this movie there was part,0.07894155
of me that felt a little disappointed when a movie is still at 100 percent,0.06596357
on Rotten Tomatoes when it has like 70 something reviews you go in with mammoth,0.24030648
expectations if I were you I would temper those expectations just ever so slightly because,0.17712015
you don't want to go into a film thinking you're going to get the experience,0.1719856
of some heavenly or of amazement when it might just be really good when it,0.053872574
comes to this movie what I like the most about it are the visuals the,0.11303091
direction the cinematography Amy Adams performance and her interaction with these beings because the film's,0.06253168
story in regards to communicating with aliens and using a language to solve problems and,0.10259147
not cause problems is a really good message and it's also a story of International,0.050612666
Cooperation and how for once everyone just has to kind of settle their differences and,0.087645195
work towards one goal and I'm sure you knew this and I'm sure a lot,0.082696564
of other critics have said this but this is no Independence Day this is not,0.07347794
a big action film this is more of a suspense drama centered around characterization using,0.111130364
a more otherworldly circumstance to build that characterization kind of like signs did you're not,0.13607007
gonna see laser guns and big explosions in this movie this is more centered on,0.26714185
character is this movie the best alien invasion movie ever made I would say it's,0.12786117
definitely up there it's one of the best top five for sure is it the,0.0305669
best movie of Danny's career I would disagree with that I would say that prisoners,0.08627501
and Sicario are both better than this film I think those films are more well,0.10527134
paced this film is very slow paced deliberately it moves along at a snail's pace,0.15505375
and for some viewers that's gonna be a humongous turn-off for me personally every frame,0.19322316
in this movie is dripping with visual beauty so if you appreciate things like that,0.12844194
it's gonna move faster for you and for me it did because it's just a,0.09288309
gorgeous looking movie one of my biggest gripes with arrival is the character by jeremy,0.10078425
renner I find him rather useless there's even a scene where he says he has,0.54785216
no idea where they'd be without Amy Adams character he has one scene where he,0.10434104
figures something out on his own without her help but for the most part he's,0.14483897
kind of in the background like hey yeah I'm here I'm in the Avengers I'm,0.15032774
Hawkeye I'm I'm here I'm relevant to this movie he just doesn't really add much,0.15205029
to the film as a character he's fine with his performance but his character is,0.0400322
rather bland and doesn't really have much to do in the film also the entire,0.067176476
marketing push of this movie is why are they here it's on almost every poster,0.06573818
once you learn why they are here it's sort of glossed over very quickly it's,0.14831737
just kind of thrown at you and you're meant to process it very fast and,0.1669115
then suddenly ignore it so that aspect of the movie disappointed me it was more,0.11759349
about Amy Adams character and less about why these things are here and I appreciate,0.08408051
the overarching symbolism of what's going on trust me I've thought about this movie a,0.10413545
lot and I don't want to spoil it for anyone that's why I'm not getting,0.07604364
too into it but in the end aspects of the third act and the way,0.046373192
things came to a story conclusion did feel a little rushed also there are some,0.07646641
characters in the movie who watched too much TV and make a poor decision I,0.11707804
don't want to spoil anything for you but that felt so out of left field,0.11532219
and the overall impact of what they did didn't last more than a few minutes,0.08638038
and really didn't change anything in the movie it just felt like a device to,0.06375533
hopefully gain a little more suspense out of a few scenes and it didn't really,0.053753696
build to anything so I wonder if it was even really necessary all in all,0.12946686
arrival is a beautifully shot movie with great performances Forest Whitaker also really good in,0.13135241
the film is accents a little iffy amazing visuals intriguing aliens a third act that,0.063094616
has a very very cool revelation that really made me think differently about the entire,0.051664803
film I love that about this film but the aspect of why the aliens are,0.10376804
actually here on earth wasn't really explored as well as I would have liked it,0.10446368
to be in the end I would highly recommend seeing arrival it's sort of a,0.052449964
mash-up of contact signs and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and I like all,0.09272863
three of those movies seeing them all smashed into one was definitely a fun time,0.43747574
for me I'm gonna give arrival and a - guys thank you so much as,0.24035163
always for watching I'm gonna have a review for shut-in with Naomi Watts as well,0.2466218

Fest in Los Angeles I'm gonna try to see Moana la-la-land and split I really,0.05919216
want to see all three of those movies and hopefully get early reviews for all,0.079606615
