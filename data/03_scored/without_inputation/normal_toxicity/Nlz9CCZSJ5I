"than one stereotype at a time. Now, a film’s style can often be broken down",0.066645004
into two rough categories: realism and formalism. Realism refers to a style in which cinematic,0.06697652
"techniques like shots, cuts, mise-en-scene, and sound are meant to be as unobtrusive as possible.",0.14909782
"The whole idea is that the filmmaking tools go largely unnoticed by the audience, allowing",0.058424156

style in which those techniques clearly and deliberately alter our perception of the film’s reality.,0.039852183
"Things like slow motion or reverse photography, obvious manipulation of the film’s sound or color",0.06002532

"wild, operatic camerawork and editing of Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull. Or the curated, almost caricatured",0.17916031
worlds created by Wes Anderson in films like Moonrise Kingdom or The Grand Budapest Hotel.,0.016606128
"While some films lean heavily into one style or the other, most mainstream movies contain",0.072002925
elements of both. And Moonlight is no exception. Jenkins captures much of Chiron’s experience with,0.052078873
realist techniques. Handheld shots follow Chiron as a young boy as he runs away from,0.15778975
his tormentors. Natural lighting fills the scene when Juan finds him sitting outside his house.,0.092329755

"seems to get Chiron and has known him for years. Kevin, played by Jharrel Jerome,",0.04249413
presents himself as confident and gregarious. He’s as at home in his own body and,0.15872006

"of his film, masterfully drawing us into his character’s heart and mind. It’s an especially",0.07690869
smart decision given how interior the film is. Jenkins uses many of the tricks of,0.07461185
cinema to help us understand Chiron’s constant struggle to reconcile his identity with the world,0.06792276
"around him. And it’s his struggle to be himself, a gay black man in America,",0.7419426
"that drives the emotional narrative of the film. Cinema scholar J. Ken Stuckey argues that,",0.0329624
“masculinity in its various forms is the main antagonist of this film. One of the,0.15438844

"fact, among those boys it’s only Kevin who truly sees Chiron as a person, rather",0.15404877
than some kind of “other” to be made fun of. And when Kevin and Chiron,0.0838721

"this moment, giving us dislocated shots of their hands and legs, bodies grappling with one",0.6047322
another. They seem somehow both trapped and free. It’s a powerful visual metaphor for Chiron’s,0.06354486
central struggle — pushing and pulling against the expectations of his community and the stereotypes,0.076310515
attached to his gender and sexual identity. And it sets up what’s to come. As,0.5154597
"an adult, in the third part of the film, Chiron’s taken on so many signifiers",0.060798578
"of traditional masculinity, he’s almost unrecognizable. In addition to his muscles, he wears gold grills",0.31307447

"a brief shot of Chiron as a boy standing on the infamous beach, looking back",0.264083
at us. And at himself. So there’s no denying that Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight is as,0.077053495

story told in a unique way. Or as an exercise in how formalist cinematic techniques,0.06642386
