unique traits and just nuances to that but she plays them as the same character,0.15405153
as well so that you can truly be a doppelganger and you see that they,0.12049008

her voice as the doppelganger is just downright creepy and weird I mean you have,0.5876557
to strain to listen to it a little bit because it's kind of like this,0.10625047

was awesome at that and the boy is just I as he crawls around as,0.099124834
the doppelganger I mean he's got this mask on and he's he's almost like animal-like,0.37921444
and it just the whole the whole imagery and their mannerisms and their movements are,0.09857586
just oh not right Elizabeth moss and Tim Heidecker are also in this but honestly,0.10632475
they're barely in it I mean they are such small minor roles they're fine at,0.27661136
what they do but they're pretty insignificant really Pele has really created an atmosphere of,0.3120032
creep in us I mean he is patient with his shots without belaboring anything I,0.37662753
mean he knows when to sit on something and when to pull off and when,0.1305614
to move it and some of the tracking and just the slowness and the patience,0.06249481
to do certain things and then some quick movements when it's called for that also,0.05347072
so just the the differences in all of his shot choices and even the way,0.11450454
that he frames different thing in different areas of the film just really draw you,0.029399622
in and they just they like hyper focus you and then you had this soundtrack,0.15383928
in this score really it's more of the score that is off-putting and it messes,0.09193492
with your mind and it sets up this tone of just creepiness and not full,0.35125428
on terror but you know that something is coming and you don't know what it,0.24178396
is but you're pretty sure you're not gonna like it the story in us is,0.15491487
really layered and complex I mean yes on its surface it is a horror psychological,0.22417547
thriller movie and it is digestible and it is accessible by everybody but I know,0.10709865
that Peale did not just make a straight-on horror film just like in get out,0.15246277
I mean he had a horror and a psychological thriller in that but he was,0.27568603
also making a point in us he's also making a point and I'm I'm gonna,0.120164886
get into that right now in this video but it's definitely see it multiple times,0.11565093
I mean I'm going to see it in just a couple days again because I,0.08865587
want to catch things that I missed the film opens in 1986 in Santa Cruz,0.072964855
and the thing it kept running through my mind is well really two things first,0.050064337
off Santa Cruz in the mid 80s was not a place to be and then,0.10692538
I kept expecting to see Kiefer Sutherland and Corey Haim on the boardwalk someplace and,0.09273602
if you don't understand what I'm talking about and you don't get that then just,0.12933406
go look it up and then it'll make a little bit of sense it's not,0.10083423
very funny but don't at least make sense I had a blast with us I,0.15297061
mean Jordan Peele has solidified his horror director writes in my mind this is a,0.31089434
spectacular film and you know once is a fluke doing it twice that shows some,0.101318225
real talent and skill if you like psychological horrors or thrillers then you're definitely gonna,0.31089434
want to check this out there is no sex or nudity but there is a,0.540541
