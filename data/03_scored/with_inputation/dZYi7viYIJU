hey how's it going everyone angie is back again for another movie review and today,0.059871115
I'm gonna be hitting you guys with my thoughts on the latest Pixar movie and,0.8060606
that film is of course Coco now this film is very interesting because I'm just,0.07411655
gonna say right now Coco is one of the best experiences that I've ever had,0.07124195
seeing a Pixar film in theaters and this has really reinvigorated my love for the,0.0798483
company because you know as it stands in the past ten years of Pixar movies,0.09415427
what we've had a lot of great standouts such as up and Toy Story three,0.055356093
everything else has just sort of been met - okay that was great for what,0.06994193
it was like for example movies that I personally enjoyed but to be honest I,0.0738212
didn't feel they were 100% necessary you know the Monsters Inc prequel what was that,0.13501593
all about finding dory while it was fun it was just kind of like okay,0.11839156
did we really need this this feels like it could have been its own animated,0.09699199
series and then you just get things that you got to avoid entirely such as,0.102640525
the car astrology and then you have stuff that doesn't even feel like it was,0.10863576
made by Pixar it looks more like a DreamWorks title that movie being brave so,0.077201106
well we've had good movies like inside out I was kind of waiting for like,0.11789055
the next big thing from Pixar the next thing that would just you know mark,0.08929184
it's whatever thing on the Pixar legacy floor mat or whatever that I'm tapping on,0.09119748
that's short of stick and thankfully Coco delivered on that front Coco is without a,0.15131445
doubt one of the most unpick star movies that there is as I was watching,0.072944835
this movie I kept thinking to myself like yo this is not really something that's,0.11242883
up Pixar's ality not to say that all Pixar movies are the same but they,0.11394754
kind of have that regular stick like Oh what would you do if toys could,0.17309675
talk what hilarious hijinks would they get into Oh what would you do if ants,0.49433988
can talk let's see the hilarious hijinks that they get into but with Coco it,0.31846452
just I couldn't put it in a box and that's what I loved about it,0.08110777
yes you could say stuff like oh it's a story about skeletons and they're talking,0.05951695
but it's really not the point of Coco at its core Coco is a movie,0.065606005
about family which I'm sure you could get from watching any of the trailers and,0.07360115
seeing commercials and stuff aspect of Koko is one of the most important parts about,0.08537066
it and I absolutely loved the way Pixar handled approaching the concept of family and,0.051273692
what it means because when you have these animated movies especially kids movies the like,0.18975304
these big themes like family and friendship for the most part they're done in a,0.08576207
very cheesy way that's just ok yeah it's fun for the five-year-olds but what about,0.08522168
for the people who are like 20 plus years old like what are we gonna,0.108487144
get out of this what are we gonna learn with Coppola they were able to,0.24038532
show you that family is very important and it shows that not all families are,0.08611001
perfect perfect example the main character in this movie named Miguel he has this dream,0.101072475
of being the world's greatest musician he loves music but due to circumstances that I'm,0.105497986
not gonna spoil with his family he doesn't really have the opportunity to do that,0.0880518
because they're just so set in their ways on avoiding music because there's very there's,0.10935916
a very negative connotation with the music and it deals with the family lineage as,0.078945175
well and I love the way that they tackle that sort of stick I mean,0.1531927
it's not groundbreaking by any stretch of the imagination but it's done with a lot,0.07919432
of heart and that's what I really love if they're gonna be taking these stories,0.10024542
that people have done time and time again like the stories of friendship and family,0.061755564
and what it means you know more often than not people like to turn it,0.20943005
on their heads and make it like like fast in a few years for example,0.13009341
not saying those are bad movies but they really plan the fact that family is,0.095065676
not just blood family is people you have connections with that's a good representation of,0.18488458
that but again it's sort of kind of a given like okay you would go,0.12374167
that route Coco still has the same basic functions of what it means to be,0.08183596
a family but it makes it feel genuine and real because I'm sure many of,0.05638999
us have gone through the situation and it's not done in a real ham-fisted over-the-top,0.17916797
cheesy way so in that respect I really liked it and in terms of just,0.08196194
how beautiful this movie was I was just so surprised at the color palette and,0.07343875
how much just life existed in the movie everything just felt so freakin Pixar is,0.4876469
unmatched when it comes to that I mean they're a great looking DreamWorks films and,0.11153737
blue sky or whatever but when you watch this movie and you look at the,0.07580333
attention to detail that exists on the characters clothes and their hair and like for,0.07445927
example whenever they come in contact with water it's just honestly felt like I was,0.06924937
watching human beings moving pixar's dangerously close to the point where we can actually see,0.11334592
realistic characters on screen and it doesn't look CG like that's where they've gotten to,0.07752638
the point and it's just it's phenomenal I loved the look of this movie I,0.08108004
loved the look of you know just like they just sheer amount of color that,0.3143354
exists with it because it really goes well with the themes of the film you,0.06275027
know a couple that with the fact that the movie in general has a lot,0.06363986
of humor and heart attached to it I think that a lot of people are,0.061592937
gonna get a ton of enjoyment out of Coco it's a movie that I think,0.15474927
will appeal to everybody whether they are a kid or whether they are a adult,0.1175221
especially considering it tackles so many adult esketh Eames that you don't necessarily see a,0.23576075
lot in kids mediums like cartoons they don't really talk about the concept of family,0.14111683
and how things get divisive and how the like dealing with the concept of death,0.2748846
and passing on and what that means and just overcoming like these are things that,0.077647224
I watch the movies when I was a kid like 20 years ago and the,0.07211314
fact that we're still getting these movies is really awesome because I can show these,0.096559644
movies to my eventual kids one day and say hey I grew up with this,0.09920662
this is a great movie that explains this to you and that's you you know,0.09046382
I had the Lion King you know teach me the understanding that you know death,0.46718845
isn't necessarily a bad thing you have to take your place in the world when,0.12284873
the time comes likewise I can show my children Coco and what this really means,0.11958931
and how family is important even though we bicker through this and then the other,0.060668413
so yeah man Coco on that front was awesome and can I also point out,0.15479766
the fact that this is one of the darker Pixar movies like I'm not gonna,0.15965001
spoil anything but there's a moment in this movie where they just go straight up,0.16079935
M night Shyamalan like really good M night Shyamalan like and night Shyamalan twist that's,0.115876995
just like whoa you know I'm saying I had two of those in this movie,0.1481033
and it's just so on Pixar because they do not beat around the bush they,0.10905079
tell you exactly what happened and I got to credit them for that because they,0.066297404
don't pull you for a fool like oh this happened because of something corny and,0.8785311
cheesy no this happened because this is how what happened in the real life so,0.11698668
yeah we're gonna do that I was left speechless and I I'm pretty sure a,0.041658115
lot of the parents were in there just like whoa look away kids and they're,0.22031389
just watching like yes this is this this is what I paid $15 for yeah,0.086613975
yes intrigued but in closing guys I freaking loved Coco it's definitely one of my,0.26978716
favorite Pixar movies and by the end of it like many folks I was very,0.08524817
close to shedding a tear I honestly didn't expect it until I just got this,0.07847393
rush of emotions and it was just like oh man I'm so happy but so,0.06665026
sad Oh comment down below if this movie made you feel emotional in any way,0.15889531
shape or form what did you think about Coco let me know down below in,0.1496474
the comment sections and for meteor for now my name is NGS signing out and,0.06424762
