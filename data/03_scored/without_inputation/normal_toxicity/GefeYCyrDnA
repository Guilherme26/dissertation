like how this is quite possibly his favorite me of the entire year so for,0.051048145
that reason alone have you not seen the trailers and early knowing that is directed,0.05301445
by Alfonso Khurana I had to check this movie yeah I did not know the,0.06985706
UH I'd seen the poster but I did not expect this movie to be as,0.04986283
artsy as I was look this movie is not for everyone if you don't like,0.11447805
having to read subtitles if you don't like walking at black-and-white movie isn't all that,0.24369627
noir style and all that you will not like this movie and this isn't your,0.19265406
cup of tea but at the same time I'm the type of person who loves,0.11015885
those movies I love going back and watching movies like some like it hot for,0.22301772
the style of the noir and I love watching foreign films like wreckin last year,0.10016226
a movie that I thought was not as scary as people made it out to,0.14342715
me but a movie I thought was very effective as a horror film and that,0.15564871
was the Spanish film Veronica I love watching foreign films I think that's some of,0.055923052
the best out there so going into this movie none of that really had any,0.09191513
issue on me I thought that was actually one of the reasons why this movie,0.1462678
works so well because it actually had me captivated I wanted to watch it more,0.112015136
because they had something for me to follow in the way of the art style,0.07079967
and also the fact I had to read the subtitles not necessarily that's a problem,0.05156517
it did distract me a little bit from certain things but it also was a,0.088087134
reason to follow the characters and read into them a lot more I found making,0.052586775
it a lot more personal and with me that's not unordinary for me to feel,0.10935737
that way when I watch foreign films or movies with subtitles I've actually found that,0.074851625
has a big positive about them except for what the waters left behind which was,0.07420165
a Spanish horror film that I saw earlier in the year at a film festival,0.083556615
that I personally really didn't enjoy to the point I didn't even bother reviewing and,0.087433845
I thought it was quite bad but at the same time foreign films love them,0.1492702
and I love to this film I think all the performances are absolutely fantastic I,0.086029425
don't know the names of any of these I should have researched and what their,0.05302774
names were before this but I think everyone did a really good job actually um,0.06156132
what is it portraying from script to screen there are motion the Alfonzo Quran directed,0.057302766
the act is so well on screen and now they were what is it position,0.06172395
and acted around the set because this looks fairly low-budget I don't know the budget,0.09363579
of this movie let me check that really quickly actually it was about 15 million,0.073594965
so not the biggest budget in the world and I think the way he directed,0.10945369
the actors is absolutely fantastic and the emotion and the hardship that he managed the,0.091495715
betray was really really damn good like there is an actress and here at first,0.53490317
time actors I don't know her name for the life of me or be here,0.12742859
in the screen or whatever but at the same time her performance in this movie,0.06494552
was beyond captivating and I honestly think she's up for Oscar nominations for one of,0.090938754
the Best Actress roles everyone in this movie gives their all and they're all Oscar,0.064376324
worthy actresses actors will you name it that are all absolutely fantastic and how the,0.12581736

for the actors not just with the director of Alfonso Cuaron which I'll get into,0.0826904
a minute but also as the viewers because you followed them aim delved into the,0.124164164
story quite in-depth now a lot of people made this had to be Alfonso Cuaron's,0.0663158
passion project and that shows because this movie seems so personal to him in the,0.08518539
web how much he does this and it was only informed by any last night,0.09438842
before I sat down and watch this movie by Dylan actually texted me saying that,0.15431416
iPhones the Quran did the cinematography himself and the thing is I think this maybe,0.14444788
should be nominated for Best Cinematography because this movie from the stylistic choices to the,0.06006095
way the movie is shot in the cinematography and the framing this is such a,0.111279964
gorgeous looking movie in every single way also the use of lighting which I don't,0.14941363
