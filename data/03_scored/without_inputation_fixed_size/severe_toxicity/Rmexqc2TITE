it is fun to be queen somehow if you do not go I will stop,0.10055182
kicking you stop my dear friend how good to see you've returned from hell I'm,0.7497569
sure you shall pass through it one day the favorite the favorite is a movie,0.025853693
about a 18th century Queen in this case Queen Anne so the favor is a,0.04478881
period piece that stars Olivia Colman Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone and it revolves around,0.06900881
Queen and and the two people that were trying to woo for her affection Sarah,0.08153622
Churchill and Abigail Hill and these people were real-life figures and as far as the,0.05379074
movie I'm sure liberties were taken but it really embattled around the Queen and her,0.03423434
health or lack thereof her struggles with France were people trying to get her to,0.051539093
do certain things and at the same time to gain power from her because of,0.027852569
weak leadership and also these two people played by Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz who,0.053902492
are trying to woo her affection and there's that infighting there the movies pretty clever,0.046495005
in how it handles the protagonist and in the spoiler section I will talk a,0.018250644
little bit more about that for the story and depth of the favorite I give,0.028131947
it a 7 I mean I think the movie did a fairly decent job of,0.042625632
keeping you on your toes because there's some unexpected things in this film that I,0.12574498
thought were pretty clever and how they were delivered and so yeah I'll give it,0.042791262
a 7 promotional impact I give it a 5 nothing really outstanding here it should,0.026228191
I get lower because I was trying to be a black comedy it didn't really,0.25100183
do a good job of that it just wasn't funny and nothing really moved me,0.058824185
one way or the other as far as intangibles category is concerned I give this,0.021390976
movie a five I don't have anything really to say about it other than maybe,0.038113028
the costumes but for a movie set in 18th century you kind of had to,0.047339123
have that so I'm not gonna give it something that's supposed to have anyway so,0.02211137
five foreign tangibles as far as watchability I give this movie a solid four which,0.06659353
means I don't want to see this movie ever again I'm never going to recommend,0.05004709
it to anybody ever again it's by far the worst oscar movie I've seen this,0.07361388
year when the worst possible movies I've seen in a long time and I know,0.03872433
there's people who wouldn't say well Kyle it's got this it's got that from a,0.0263293
tactical standpoint yeah it's probably great you know but if you don't want to a,0.046081927
movie or watch a movie or recommend a movie how can you say it's good,0.038544733
remember movies are subjective meaning that my opinion is no better than yours and so,0.03238247
forth there's no way to say that when movie is better than the other but,0.0113719795
on my rating this movie is not very good at all and for an oscar,0.109687455
movie it's a four it doesn't deliver on anything it wants to do with one,0.033804633
caveat which I would get in the spoiler section my overall rating for this film,0.103306346
is a five then even pretty much two and a half stars because you know,0.01937813
it does have things in it that are pretty brilliant in terms of technical stuff,0.023445062
but in terms of the story and the characters yeah it's a five now for,0.008110584
my conservative take spoilers are below this movie is pretty much like I said before,0.06945848
is not something I want to watch I mean all the characters are horrible characters,0.038030546
the Queen herself is a character that her main cohort was trying to woo her,0.08375461
affection she's played by Rachel Weisz her character is pretty despicable at least in the,0.09907312
beginning but then you have Emma Stone who comes into play and this is where,0.018839996
I think the movie excels in the sense that you take a character like Emma,0.0843067
Stone who you believe is a innocent had the good lucky person just trying to,0.052469686
move her way up Excel she becomes a total horrible person and it's like dude,0.2792783
really you can be like that so really you have a Jeff's position of the,0.02434173
Sarah Churchill which is the character who is basically the the first in line to,0.0065726796
the Queen and you have Abigail Hill which is her cousin we just played by,0.04853845
Emma Stone those two people just juxtaposed toward the end because Emma Stone's character basically,0.06425541
finagles me away almost killed her her older cousin to get in the position to,0.65601796
where she could be close to the Queen she does whatever it takes and she,0.039502595
beat it's a total evil character and the Queen recognizes this and eventually puts her,0.28426668
in a place at the end of the movie and that's pretty much it so,0.03451372
we're pretty much set we're at the beginning in the film where we thought the,0.012447582
Queen was one one way you thought that the Sarah Churchill character was one way,0.008898161
the Emma Stone character Abigail Hill they switch places and then in the film you,0.0377505
have busy what you had before but just two positions walked over and it was,0.013216534
done pretty well because I thought Emma Stone's it good job playing that role it,0.029162316
was a very very evil role and for that I give it that's probably where,0.055039957
it's really really excels but overall it's not worth getting their something worth two two,0.12668157
and a half hours to watch that to get to that point just my opinion,0.023085864
as far as social justice or political stuff on this I don't see any reason,0.02272733
you could not watch this I mean there's nothing bad in that regard so I,0.0777021
would give it a go with caution just because I'm not giving it a go,0.026373867
period from the other standpoint so it is what it is but there's nothing in,0.02861487
my opinion that's overtly political or trying to manipulate in terms of something that's inaccurate,0.053439524
out of history it is what it is and yeah so I say go with,0.02817585
caution so a final review for this would be an overall rating will be nine,0.064699754
point seven five which for oscar film is really really really low that translates to,0.04385955
a two and a half star out of four and three stars out of five,0.022165915
which is fairly generous but because of Emma Stone's acting and some of the set,0.014644683
pieces they do with dancing and the historical standpoint does keep me interested to a,0.016742008
point so I can say if you're interested in history I could at least recommend,0.024832636
it from that standpoint given the two and a half stars but in my opinion,0.014673951
this is not an oscar-worthy film in the least so with that I hope you,0.13726929
enjoyed that and look for my other reviews coming up on the Oscars and others,0.028795134
