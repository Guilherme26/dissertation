hello everyone today i'll be reviewing the philadelphia story so the philadelphia story came out,0.031451214
in 1940 and was directed by george cucor and this stars catherine hepburn cary grant,0.044617858
and james stewart right at the start of this film we see cary grant and,0.038234092
catherine hepburn are a married couple who are actually just about to break up and,0.032311294
then suddenly the film fast forwards two years later where we see catherine hepburn is,0.010001701
arranged to be married to another man a rather rich man in fact however carrie,0.19709258
grant's character he is very much still in love with catherine hepburn's character tracy it's,0.06861901
very obvious and then we're later introduced to james stewart's character called mike and also,0.016904978
this other character called liz and mike and liz are photographers and they are arranged,0.027564544
to go and go and see and photograph tracy's wedding so this film is one,0.0936665
of those classic comedies of the 1930s 1940s and a very innocent type of film,0.058563434
very light-hearted and what i really like about this film is the dialogue because the,0.023359254
dialogue is very interesting in this film all of the characters whenever they're speaking they,0.014278832
are very witty and everything they're saying is very interesting and they actually do tend,0.014804327
to talk quite quickly in this film and this film never really stops when it,0.037032768
comes to the characters talking and everybody takes a break now some people might not,0.042891707
like that and i think particularly with modern audiences watching this film it can seem,0.04371853
that the characters talk perhaps a bit too much and maybe say quite a lot,0.03318335
and maybe maybe just talk and talk and talk and never really stop and in,0.035659164
some ways that is true however everything that these characters say is does come across,0.017089898
as very intelligent on screen and very witty and just the the way these characters,0.02068056
communicate with each other the chemistry that i have on screen catherine hepburn is particularly,0.055686515
impressive in this films gives a fantastic performance and so does james stewart as well,0.03983386
in fact james stewart actually won the oscar for best actor for this film and,0.035979785
he really gives a a very impressive and unique performance in this film we don't,0.02769359
normally think of james stewart as being an actor who woos the ladies but in,0.1118493
this film he really comes across in that way as opposed to the sort of,0.11082159
honest nice guy that he is in other films although he still is a very,0.07803336
likable character in this film some people actually think that james stewart won the oscar,0.04444358
for this film as consolation for not winning it for mr smith goes to washington,0.04517129
which came out the previous year but really what the song focuses on is catherine,0.02245793
hepburn she's the main star and there's three men in this film who essentially have,0.05532798
affection for catherine hepburn's character tracy or almost seem to fall in love with her,0.062945664
so i've got cary grant james stewart and also catherine hepburn's future husband or the,0.031880256
man she is hoping to marry in this film draws kitterage and these three men,0.067993075
are very different characters but they all have something different to say and something different,0.009901258
to put on screen and and all have a different input to this film this,0.022598283
is one of those films that really doesn't take itself too seriously there aren't really,0.028258996
any dark or evil moments in this film which is something i like however some,0.1468293
people might find this film lacks a bit of energy or maybe doesn't have many,0.046816956
interesting scenes in it but if you view this as a romantic comedy then it,0.06618843
really does the job extremely well everything about this film says romantic comedy just the,0.02763306
way that these characters are talking all the scenes and although obviously this film came,0.013723404
out in 1940 so it won't be as risque in terms of the sexual or,0.31321722
nudity or things like that obviously there's none of that here but it is often,0.11639184
quite suggestive in quite a few scenes with the innuendos which is very cleverly done,0.06968264
especially in films of this era but obviously it doesn't show too much on screen,0.035663158
there are a few scenes or perhaps it's it slightly makes reference to something which,0.020131119
is all very cleverly done so this was the second time that i'd seen this,0.032049213
film and i think i liked it quite a bit more this time than i,0.07104561
did the first time and it was it was interesting how watching for a second,0.025075428
time there were some bits i remembered in certain bits i didn't however this time,0.06559443
i did spend much more time listening to the dialogue and i think the first,0.020554174
time i watched it i found the dialogue a bit annoying this time i really,0.064104415
appreciate it i really appreciated all these different lines that these characters have all these,0.017121827
different character moments especially with james stewart's character but really catherine hepburn um is the,0.009527425
main star and we get a few scenes where she plays her character slightly different,0.021112263
because she's a very rich wealthy character and she tries to come across as slightly,0.089054786
different in a few scenes which is quite amusing particularly with the photographers when she's,0.06408845
first meeting them she's trying to come across as something a bit different and then,0.07860941
we have these other these other two characters known as papa and uncle willie and,0.02942972
their identities get switched round and that's a very funny scene as well we also,0.033917714
have a younger girl called diner in this and she is very good as well,0.06541283
overall i think the philadelphia story is a decent romantic comedy unfortunately it's not going,0.041949805
to appeal to everyone especially with the dialogue the way the characters speak in this,0.011232956
film i've read some other reviews some people might get slightly annoyed by a dialogue,0.028574293
in this film and feel like their characters talk too much i can see that,0.034723252
but i personally don't really agree i think it's an enjoyable film i don't necessarily,0.035530783
think it's one of the best romantic comedies of all time but i can certainly,0.02743949
see why it is regarded as a classic particularly with stars like catherine hepburn cary,0.053752825
grant and james stewart all in one film together and i personally did find the,0.0297224
ending to be a little bit tacky a little bit cheesy but at the same,0.16938835
time it was believable so i can forgive it for that and i suppose in,0.039142065
these type of films you want to have an ending like this if the ending,0.16569991
was different i i don't know how i would end the film otherwise come to,0.043684606
think of it so overall a very enjoyable film if you like romantic comedies um,0.15946315
especially classic ones in this era then this is probably one of the best ones,0.03703144
to watch so i'm gonna give the philadelphia story a rating of eight out of,0.046884138
ten it's an excellent romantic comedy however i myself i don't always enjoy romantic comedies,0.13760655
that much so that's probably why i haven't rated it higher so there we go,0.028819747
so that is my review of the philadelphia story so what do you guys think,0.020560162
have you seen the philadelphia story do you like it do you dislike it please,0.030674944
