a purely historical analysis doesn’t seem like the most useful form of film criticism to,0.024860574
evaluate it. There’s a school of thought that says the first few minutes of a,0.039617673
"well-constructed movie will teach us how to watch it, so we can start by delving",0.034813717
into those first scenes. The film opens with King’s words spoken over a black screen.,0.002748179
"It’s not the booming voice of his most famous speeches. It’s soft, low, and almost",0.043090597
tentative. King: I accept this honor for our lost ones. Whose deaths pave our path.,0.060010206
"The first shot is a close-up of King facing the camera in a dark room,",0.24465902
"practicing a speech, and doing a terrible job of tying an ascot. Then his wife,",0.23340733
"Coretta Scott King, played by Carmen Ejogo, enters the room. She helps him tie the",0.04949698
"ascot, and we get an intimate view of their relationship. The lighting is dark and",0.07657261
"the framing is relatively still, isolating these two as they struggle to balance their work,",0.027944366
"their public personas, and their marriage. In the next scene, King receives his Nobel Peace",0.041829407
"Prize. DuVernay now uses more traditionally heroic angles, keeping us slightly lower than King and",0.031940788
"craning up, making him seem larger than life, the public figure of popular myth. These",0.045817185
"scenes give us two different Kings, one private – introspective and doubting – and one",0.013960875
"public – confident and majestic. Finally, the third scene gives us those kids walking down",0.029617302
"the church stairs. When the bomb goes off, it rips through the wall, cutting them",0.51581264
"off mid-sentence. The violence is unexpected and immediate. It’s shocking. Then, DuVernay does something interesting.",0.04960075
"As the explosion blows apart both brick and flesh, she slows the images down until",0.21459822
they’re almost abstract. It becomes difficult to tell people from objects as they whirl across,0.10954577
"the screen, crossfading into one another in slow motion. This extends the horror, but also",0.061387803
suggests that the aftermath of this kind of racist violence will last much longer than,0.25526825
the bomb itself. This third scene also underlines the main duality of the film –,0.15780151
the collision of private and public spaces. This intimate childhood moment is invaded by a,0.054718006
terrorist’s explosive. And these themes show up again and again throughout the rest of the,0.22548692
"film. The framing of that first shot, with King squared off to the camera, is",0.07698237
repeated often – from King and his aides to regular people joining the march. By,0.054034863
"presenting their characters boldly, unapologetically, facing off with us, DuVernay and her cinematographer Bradford Young",0.056065004
reinforce the idea that this movie is about people demanding their dignity in the face,0.12470464
of both incredible violence and apathy. This film also keeps exploring the juxtaposition of private,0.074875064
"and public spaces. In intimate moments, DuVernay’s King lowers his guard and shares his fears.",0.022986086
"These scenes are almost always shot at night, in houses, churches, and jail cells. In",0.09812257
"an early scene, King makes a late-night phone call to gospel singer Mahalia Jackson after",0.019844424
"an emotional low-point. She sings “Take My Hand, Precious Lord” as King gathers strength, alone,",0.03160221
"in his dark kitchen. Echoing that scene much later, King goes for a midnight drive",0.14871311
"with John Lewis, one of his youngest supporters, and expresses grave doubts about their mission.",0.009764231
"This time, instead of a song, Lewis speaks about his own experience being inspired by",0.028518418
"King and urges him to continue on his path. Lewis: The next day, I found",0.017102536
"myself patched up, and sittin' in a church. Lewis: Barely hold my head up, but",0.03567912
I needed to be there. You were gonna be speaking. This public-private juxtaposition is also,0.028745245
embodied in David Oyelowo’s performance. King’s physicality and vocal cadence change depending on his audience.,0.047355752
"From restrained but firm with Johnson, to soft and anguished with Coretta, and righteous before",0.043639373
the microphones. This version of King is a close examination of what it means –,0.054370116
"and what it costs – for people of color to code switch, or change their",0.17020653
"style of presentation to fit the moment. That said, no space was totally private for",0.019875022
"King, either. At key points throughout the movie, subtitles on the screen give us notes",0.014050009
"from the FBI surveillance logs with details about King’s movements, visitors, and phone calls. It’s",0.013387486
a chilling reminder that even his most intimate moments are being monitored. The examination of,0.02017236
"public and private space comes up in scenes without King, too. Oprah Winfrey plays Annie",0.04561231
"Lee Cooper, a character who tries to register to vote. She approaches the county clerk",0.030437473
"who humiliates and threatens her, before finally denying her application – for the fifth time!",0.15871215
The message is clear: public spaces in this part of the South were effectively off-limits,0.027720863
to a big chunk of the population. Political figures like President Johnson and the George,0.030824611

"interior scenes – but always during the daytime. They have power, the movie tells us.",0.025798483
The question for them is how they’re going to use it. In the film’s climactic,0.026113115
"moments, these public and private spaces finally collide and are punctuated by destruction. When an",0.11882907
"Alabama State Trooper shoots an unarmed black man, or thugs beat to death a white",0.68571943
"pastor from Boston, DuVernay again slows the action. She forces us to endure the violence",0.058448356
"and contemplate its aftermath. Both these acts of violence take place at night, which the",0.12943277
film has already coded as private space. But then DuVernay breaks this pattern to depict,0.083525114
"the Bloody Sunday violence, again in slow motion, when marchers were beaten on the Edmund",0.14997563
"Pettus Bridge. It takes place in broad daylight, under the watchful eye of television cameras.",0.017728474
And this is where the film crosscuts between the public violence and the folks at,0.068046294
home – in their private spaces – recoiling in horror. Even though it breaks the,0.061024614
"historical chronology, intercutting these events completes the theme of the movie, thrusting the usually private",0.028024852
"pain and violence into the glaring light of public scrutiny. Once again, DuVernay is using",0.12577891
"the tools of cinema here – shots, cuts, and sound – to reinforce her film’s",0.0048046215
message in subtle and sophisticated ways. There are lots of other things to say about,0.030239249
"Selma, on matters from race and class, to gender equity and social justice. But almost",0.07095181
all of it can be read in terms of this tension between public and private,0.032238126
