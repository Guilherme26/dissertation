I wasn't sure if I was gonna make it in time to see this movie,0.08319423
because the AMC near me didn't have it anymore the Regal didn't have it so,0.111927986
I thought you know what I'm gonna have to probably just wait until it's on,0.0785791
streaming but thanks to smaller theatres like AFI I was able to catch this one,0.109272815
just in time the farewell is written and directed by Lulu Wang and stars aquafina,0.052870527
as Billy Billy has just learned that her grandma is dying and her family is,0.31089434
gonna go visit her but they don't want to tell her grandma that she's dying,0.40403795
so they make up an excuse that there's a wedding happening in the family so,0.061961863
that everybody can come together and see her one last time two things interested me,0.1633701
about this movie one the premise and to seeing Aquafina in a more serious role,0.09238186
because usually she does more over-the-top comedic roles and I think it was definitely interesting,0.061004877
to see her do something different overall I would say the Ferrell was a great,0.09496339
time there was great performances beautiful cinematography and really good balance between comedy and drama,0.104383744
so let's get into it so it worked first and foremost this movie looked great,0.08771982
from the cinematography to the locations I think somebody's just very visually appealing they shot,0.17532691
it on location in China and New York so you get a lot of great,0.078967154
cityscapes another thing that really stood out to me where the performances in this movie,0.06782707
especially Aquafina I think she really carried this movie again we're not used to seeing,0.118247025
her in serious roles so I think this is really refreshing and I think she,0.12607984
killed it she did great playing this granddaughter who had to act like everything was,0.6624083
okay but really it was it because she along with her family were the only,0.11190305
ones that really knew what was going on while her grandma was just kind of,0.13430129
going on about you know having time of her life as if life goes on,0.24262738
because again she doesn't know so I think that balance was really interesting that dynamic,0.12627907
and seeing how everybody's being affected by this tragedy or potential tragedy in their family,0.05674083
speaking of which the grandma played by a xu xin zhao i hope i'm pronouncing,0.08152746
her name correctly was also amazing her dynamic with awkwafina's character billy was really what,0.06033133
drove this movie she was very energetic she was very funny and I think it,0.14969647
made even more tragic to see her going about her life but then we the,0.1534339
audience and the family know that her time is running short also I think this,0.053722624
movie was generally funny even though the subject the premise is kind of sad and,0.08329385
dark I think they did manage to find some nice moments to have some comedy,0.1535607
between the family members seeing them play off of each other I think that really,0.087184496
made this movie entertaining and it really made me fall in love with these characters,0.12131804
but what I think worked the most for me and this would be what I,0.09091411
think really sold it was how they explored the ethics of the situation and seeing,0.0798255
them go back and forth arguing whether they're right or wrong to not tell her,0.12618332
grandma that she's dying and they mentioned in the movie like in America this wouldn't,0.18289061
fly they would definitely make them tell or the doctor would be obligated to tell,0.05300587
the grandma yes you have cancer you're dying but in China they believe no you,0.63401425
should let these people live the rest of their lives happy and not till the,0.43777645
very last minute that they should tell her the truth and so seeing this back,0.054797485
and forth between the family members I think really kept me intrigued seeing their different,0.058298245
perspectives there's also an interesting discussion about immigration in this movie where there's two sides,0.07732873
of the family there are people that stayed in China and those who left to,0.080514595
find better jobs better education for their children better opportunity and we see a clash,0.13639644
between these two sides and they're kind of arguing on who made the right call,0.07099987
who's really doing what's best for their family in the family as a whole and,0.06694073
I thought that was a really interesting conflict they added to this movie the only,0.1515995
thing I can think of that could have been done a little bit better in,0.07891697
this movie was the ending now there is a part where they do wrap up,0.07869891
the story with the grandma well and I think they did a great job of,0.06998398
wrapping up things with the family but then there's one scene in towards the end,0.06763298
where it kind of just ends and then there's something in the credits and then,0.07513352
you're like okay I get it now but I think they definitely could have done,0.14148307
something within that scene to really tie everything together and really wrap it up but,0.081779
otherwise I think this was a great movie the verdict I think this movie was,0.10489769
a good time The Farewell offers great performances beautiful scenery cinematography it also has a,0.06505976
lot of great messages about ethics and teaches a lot about Chinese culture so I,0.10007482
think there's a lot to get from this movie and it's definitely worth seeing in,0.070760794
theaters but if you don't catch as theaters of course you can always try and,0.06703117
find out in streaming or just go buy the DVD so have you seen the,0.15052427
