of his best films to see a favorite actor doing some of his best work,0.099111564
in a movie that I'd really like even if he wasn't in it is a,0.112042315
winning combination his performance in shadow of a doubt which is also a favorite movie,0.056870762
of might have a slight edge over this one but his character here is more,0.04676199
appealing he's just a regular guy trying to do the right thing who gets pulled,0.1595432
in over his head but while Joseph Cotten is the lead even I have to,0.11615391
admit that it's Orson Welles who steals the show Welles comes into the movie very,0.17951262
late and his total time on screen is less than 15 minutes but he changes,0.11564954
everything when people think of this movie they think of Orson Welles his famous last-minute,0.0964703
addition of the cuckoo clock speech his overlapping murmuring style of dialogue and of course,0.25961548
his entrance which must be counted entirely separate from Welles himself as it is one,0.15072854
of the movies best most famous scenes this is a big reveal in the plot,0.06452403
so I can't talk about it in too much detail but it is one of,0.05486883
the best character introductions on film at this point in the movie audiences have been,0.048234284

film through the years and we're good friends in real life so it's always a,0.039423946
pleasure to watch them share the screen but it isn't just about cotton and wells,0.07772466

the rest of this perfect cast number five is the writing third man was written,0.2061181
by Graham Greene the famous British novelist and I find the script pretty delightful the,0.084355734
movie is by no means a comedy but in my opinion at least it's got,0.10112932
several amusing parts and strokes of dark levity many of the quirkiest lines are spoken,0.13044645
by the British characters who come off as even more quintessentially British than usual contrasted,0.16487655
as they are with Joseph Cotton's very American character I think the dryness of the,0.08148782
delivery the matter-of-fact attitude the characters have toward everything and how the dialogue adds to,0.06956559
the strange off-balance tone of the film overall really sells the script for me but,0.080166794
from a larger perspective while the third man is a mystery there are a lot,0.07516992
of other themes at play the gritty aftermath of war the devastation of a friend's,0.17383957
betrayal the disappointment of lost love or unrequited love which I'm always a sucker for,0.72692585
and the crisis of a moral dilemma there's a lot going on but it all,0.07219732
works together really well I won't say more beyond that because therein lies spoiler territory,0.20434977
and as I said I don't want to give anything away to anyone watching this,0.08892213
who has not yet seen movie number six is the cinematography the third man won,0.14874305
the Academy Award for his black-and-white cinematography so of course it's a highlight it's renowned,0.0825532
for its use of Dutch angles shots in which the image is tilted director Carol,0.106503084
Reed did not invent the Dutch angle which first came into use during the German,0.11069295
expressionist era but he was the first to use it so prominently as a storytelling,0.097204715
and mood enhancing device chiefly to convey disorientation but when I think of how the,0.080817
movie looks it's about more than the Dutch angles the black-and-white photography looks fantastic and,0.25216004
the camera takes full advantage of the shadows the scenery the way the addition or,0.06710977
subtraction of light alters an image there's more I could mention but I'll just say,0.044613674
I never get tired of looking at this movie number seven is the editing now,0.12071962
this is something that I never really noticed before I picked up on it this,0.10078454
last time that I watched the movie a couple days ago and I noticed it,0.07303249
right from the beginning the movie starts with an opening monologue featuring Carol Reed's voice,0.05981129
over talking about the old Vienna versus the new Vienna borne out of war the,0.14200859
succession of images we see moves very rapidly reflecting the voice-over but also supplementing it,0.066761486
with images that show the extra meaning behind the words the best example of this,0.06345667
is when read casually refers to amateurs who attempted to get into the cutthroat black,0.5876557
market trade and failed what we see on screen for a couple seconds is a,0.089628205
body floating facedown in the river the sewer chase scene also has some remarkable visual,0.106631614
and sound editing the play around with perspective in any given scene in the film,0.06719449
the camera itself doesn't move around much but the editing style of quick cuts and,0.057238918
alternating angles gives an impression of movement and rapid pace number eight is post-war Vienna,0.09728694
I've alluded to this already but it gets its own slot because Vienna is such,0.15909404
an integral part of the movie this isn't the charming old Vienna of Strauss days,0.09464838
this is a desperate cynical City divided up into four occupied zones governed by the,0.32642534
Americans the British the French and the Soviets with one shared international zone in the,0.24194236
centre where the movie takes place the film which was shot largely on location treats,0.10029287
Vienna less like a backdrop and more like another character who moons over the plot,0.21394694
the bombed out buildings piles of rubble and dark winding roads tell their own story,0.1521323
as do the characters who inhabit them sketchy racketeers looking for a profit and suspicious,0.11121711
locals trying to scramble together a living as honestly as they possibly can number nine,0.18821234
is the final scene this is kind of tricky to talk about since it is,0.0628162
the end of the movie and I'm committed to not giving anything away so I'll,0.06585706
just have to be vague I considered slipping a mention of this scene in under,0.14482167
another category but which one under writing because it was such a daringly unexpected realistic,0.06379321
note for a movie to end on in 1949 under editing because of the bold,0.15181015
absence of a cut that would have made the scene in sooner and robbed it,0.23916666
of its effectiveness under cinematography because it's such a beautiful shot with the tree-lined streets,0.19655721

the camera no I couldn't put it under any one category what makes the scene,0.081753395
so special is all of those things together so it has to go on its,0.100434095
own number ten last but absolutely not least the music anton Kara's zither music is,0.09458272
one of the most famous recognizable things about this movie if you don't know what,0.13875218
is if there is here's a picture the story goes that while in Vienna Carol,0.053952113
Reed happened to hear Kara's playing his it there at a party and was so,0.071018726
taken with unique sound that he asked Harris to write the score for his movie,0.06314308
the resulting score was a huge success the third man theme was released as a,0.06160499
single and became a number-one bestseller in both the UK and the US the music,0.0795743
adds so much to the peculiar atmosphere of the movie there's the jaunty main theme,0.08751771
but also the slower more melancholy or pensive music such as accompanies the final scene,0.14891988
and the excited or frantic strumming at key moments like the story the characters and,0.04318468
the lopsided photography the music is slightly off-kilter and unexpected it's just the right kind,0.17814238
of music this movie needed the third man is one of my go-to movies I,0.15511188
