playlist you'll probably like if you're a fan of film I'll leave a link down,0.075089924
below so the Philadelphia Story was released in 1940 it was directed by a filmmaker,0.052818242
named George Cukor he directed a lot of comedies at the time but he's done,0.03770128
other films as well his best-known movie is the musical my fair lady so in,0.030993566
the Philadelphia Story when a rich husband's ex-husband and a tabloid type reporter turned up,0.03151374
just before her playing remarriage she begins to learn the truth about herself the film,0.03402082
stars Cary Grant Katharine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart but right off the bat I love,0.044861317
the cast in this film Katharine Hepburn plays the snooty rich brat she is easily,0.30869752
probably the best thing about this movie her performance is so larger-than-life and I just,0.100154705
enjoy her bubbly personality on the display in this film it's great seeing her team,0.15280798
up again with Cary Grant I last month I did a review of bringing a,0.01866838
baby which the two were in and they were a fantastic duo and they're once,0.053126886
again good in this film Cary Grant was the ex-husband and as I guess enjoyable,0.06366473
seeing that play out in a sense and Jimmy Stewart plays the tabloid reporter that,0.022789856
goes into trying to mess everything up and her knee marriage and I thought he,0.09776071
was a lot of fun I questioned the fact that the Academy gave him an,0.020218257
Oscar for Rolle yeah Jimmy Stewart won an Oscar of all the movies he was,0.028727286
in for the Philadelphia Story you should have won for it's a wonderful life for,0.026690494
mr. Smith goes to Washington but Philadelphia Story he's solid enough not his best performance,0.023023337
in my opinion I do like the premise on paper on paper this is a,0.03964162
wildly entertaining premise it's kind of a satire on the lifestyle of the rich I'm,0.06882522
not gonna lie the third act is where the movie really picks up and there,0.018712947
are some legit funny moments I think what actually got the biggest laugh out of,0.032645218
me without trying to ruin the plot Acacia and seen it there's a scene where,0.05876964
Jimmy Stewart sing somewhere over the rainbow from the woods of Oz not used to,0.03619131
seeing that actor sing before but I thought it was the funniest thing hands down,0.08263776
in the whole film there's also this little girl in the film and actually did,0.043948017
get a few chuckles out of me I thought she was actually one of the,0.091398895
scene stewards of the film my issues with the Philadelphia Story and this is actually,0.020278124
really bad issues I actually think the direction of this film is very bland and,0.09185388
actually knocks a movie down quite a bit as much as I love the cast,0.13430724
it does have some funny moments I just uh never really felt anything in the,0.03779773
direction of this film seem like the movie was on snooze the whole time and,0.034294207
it didn't really go anywhere with its payoff even the comedy in this film for,0.03254145
the most part was very dry everything just seemed like again that snooze button just,0.02517321
won't go off it was probably a thing in the times in 1940's comedy a,0.041268658
lot of it was probably like that and it did kind of feel a little,0.021599844
day in places so it might be just our 21st century guy trying to watch,0.026266772
an older film and I don't think it's really held up well to me the,0.019998081
way the story played out and there's like so many love triangles and stuff played,0.023312027
throughout this film the tone of the film played Mike melodramatic soap opera and I,0.028909547
hate soap opera so for me it didn't really engage me because of that and,0.23849747
that really I really rolled my eyes for most of run time the film also,0.036892414
felt 20 minutes too long two hours is a bit long for a film of,0.04684423
this type I think if you cut about 20 minutes of filler I think it,0.2476245
would have been a better paced film but the other day I'm not the biggest,0.034693982
fan of Philadelphia story I find the film pretty dull and tedious in my opinion,0.18178605
mainly due the bland direction as much as I love the cast and there are,0.04420212
some legit funny moments in places that doesn't excuse the film from being as bland,0.049398534
as it is especially in the direction Department no think George Cukor is that great,0.03730749
of a director of my opinion I'm not the biggest fan of my fair lady,0.057637498
there I do have some issues with that film but the Philadelphia story is to,0.018313836
me at least very lackluster and unpopular opinion I actually enjoy its musical remake which,0.12325188
is considered worse than this film for many people better than the Philadelphia Story which,0.035492867
musical remake is called high society if you're unaware of that for the Philadelphia Story,0.0290499
I'm gonna give it a two and a half out of five stars and on,0.03181773
the under point scale of 47 out of 100 so that was my review of,0.06772235
The Philadelphia Story it's part of my pre 1980 classic review series I tried to,0.031868283
two classics a month the theme of this month is original versus remake I'm trying,0.028836377
to prove that how I would still remake movies even in the goin Age of,0.031216403
Hollywood it's nothing new I don't see this because a lot of people complain about,0.04474491
a lot of the remakes and today's era of filmmaking but Hollywood still remains stuff,0.020201627
even in the Golden Age and before the muff is done I do plan on,0.066336766
reviewing the musical remake of Philadelphia story like I said it's called high society and,0.012390376
it's a very obscure film I can't wait to talk about that Phil if you,0.06423346
guys if you've seen the Philadelphia Story I know I'm in the minority on this,0.035365153
one is a lot of people tend to praise this film let me know in,0.06572879
