quite frankly I'm shocked that Avengers endgame is this good but then again I didn't,0.041836496
expect the Russo brothers to go Spielberg quite brilliant what do you think about it,0.13045874
and that not only they thought of going Spielberg in but they actually kind of,0.09206055
pulled it off it's not like it's not like a I wouldn't say it's a,0.10488344
ripoff of Spielberg but I'd say it's as much like Spielberg films as some of,0.15131825
the films that Robert Zemeckis has made and don't worry we're definitely going to talk,0.07676855
about back to the future welcome to my non-spoiler review of Avengers endgame and don't,0.075914174
worry I've gone through my notes for this review several times to make sure that,0.06253338
there is not a hint of a spoiler so it is safe to watch but,0.056156944
we are so much to talk about when I get to the spoiler review pretty,0.0764265
soon I but don't worry I'm gonna be very careful when I post that as,0.08566157
well all right so as I tweeted hours ago Avengers endgame you know I tweeted,0.06463472
this right after the press screening Avengers endgame truly is the greatest superhero movie of,0.04623959
all time and some of you were like you just got out of the movie,0.25065997
grace well it's been a few hours as I said and I still feel that,0.064827874
way now also some of you said you know your immediate reaction was also what,0.08570565
about insert superhero movie name here and my answer to that is those movies are,0.10326887
still great in fact Avengers endgame couldn't have happened without those movies because Avengers endgame,0.10499835
is truly the evolution of superhero filmmaking and someday I know it's gonna be hard,0.085890785
to believe after you see Avengers endgame but I guarantee you that someday and even,0.079425454
better superhero movie than this will come along but boy have the Russo brothers Kevin,0.10358843
Feige and the cast the cast is so good here across the board they have,0.0724173
set the bar very high and boy by the way speaking of the cast and,0.10853909
bringing it I cried so much during this movie like for the first two-thirds I,0.107429065
was like so far so good haven't shed any tears you know I can take,0.13871513
it it's not it's not that sad cuz you know people going into this for,0.113266386
like oh I know I'm gonna cry a whole lot but I was like oh,0.10709056
that's just the hardcore Marvel fans I'll be fine third act BAM I was bawling,0.14760108
tears of joy and sadness but like I cried all my makeup it was crazy,0.28486738
it was rude and I even actually kind of teared up a little bit after,0.30461395
the movie thinking about it someone also tears of joy and sadness there as well,0.092652425
now I would say the biggest inspirations for avengers endgame movie wise are the following,0.0681555
the first Avengers the magic of that film which perfectly captured not only what a,0.075021125
team-up movie can be but what it's like to read a comic book I often,0.16999565
particularly in the third act felt like I was looking at comic book panels even,0.088875644
actually throughout the movie we very much had that feeling Logan and what it's like,0.043225307
to draw upon years that fans and actors have spent with characters and then back,0.05050917
to the future Wow reference several times in this very movie Avengers end game is,0.07226248
as good not better than back to the future when it comes to time-traveling storytelling,0.09303467
by the way those of you re watching all the MCU movies to prepare for,0.07499469
this one you are not wasting your time I didn't watch them though but I,0.19034883
you know I still was able to enjoy this movie because I did recall a,0.06928987
lot of the things they were referencing it still was really full of really great,0.05160923
surprises an Avengers end game on that notice I said has strong hints of Spielberg,0.11595266
just as the mecha has worked in in that trilogy really strong hints of Spielberg,0.06249373
when I think about it I think that's why it works so well Spielberg has,0.054548133
that that lightness that magic that sense of drama theme a little bit of a,0.14859894
theme park you feel to it that's the best way to describe Avengers and geib,0.26432905
Spielberg in now speaking back to the future don't worry this isn't a spoiler I'm,0.06777018
just trying to describe a sensation so now remember at the end of part 2,0.052653637
when Marty learns that doc has been transported back to 1885 has been and has,0.0678423
been living there right that was an amazing moment in cinematic history Doug again as,0.05049719
I said to worry this is not a spoiler and audiences when they saw that,0.059072815
had to wait an entire year to see what happened next well here you don't,0.076345295
have to wait they play that second movie it's almost as if adventures end game,0.06622985
is two films but two films that fit together it's a joy instead of like,0.062153168
oh you cheated instead you're like thank you for letting me watch it now now,0.2854322
remember also speaking of other films when I said that I was watching The Incredibles,0.08412289
- I felt bad that I you know the sense of dread came about you,0.31089434
know towards the end knowing that it would end well Avengers endgame again on that,0.0664077
note did not really end right I got so much story so much wish fulfillment,0.07187454
but yeah at the same time so many surprises and all ton by the way,0.051942755
in a very masterful way don't worry I'm gonna give the screenwriters their own shout,0.1551612
out a little later on in this review but when the movie finally did end,0.09623566
with plenty of teases for phase 4 by the way there are no end credits,0.07206677
scenes but it doesn't really need them again they do a lot to set up,0.07022963
what's gonna happen going forward but I not only felt sad is fine but I,0.07534561
have complete faith in the MCU going forward I mean I'm sure they'll make a,0.059027676
couple of mistakes here and there but overall I feel Kevin Feige is as seasoned,0.109125584
as the Avengers themselves now something I was not prepared for going into this movie,0.06748512
was how strong the representation is when it comes to women oh man we talk,0.18115537
so much about representation these days and I guess you know we have had a,0.036144387
lot of talk about representation for women but this stuff felt really good I mean,0.19536887
that also brought a tear to my eye several times and while I criticized Avengers,0.10941883
infinity war for fridge and Gamora which they totally did Avengers endgame does right by,0.13557886
so many female characters so many of them if you like any female character in,0.15307903
the MCU I think you're gonna be pretty happy at the end of this movie,0.1171039
and there's also a third act surprise that took my breath away I'm not kidding,0.0792378
I gasped in the theater I was like are you gonna do this and they,0.31089434
did several times actually with female characters come to think of it and the women,0.17083067
and Avengers are simply that they're Avengers fellow warriors with as much on the line,0.11423859
and just as committed and just as at risk no Mary Sue's here as their,0.07034371
male counterparts and I could not be happier now speaking of representation while the door,0.2755531
is closed on Stuckey alas a window has been opened with Captain Marvel just opened,0.10714978
a smidge mind you but distinctly opened not overtly opened there's just a slight rainbow,0.13256209
breeze but I think it's definitely there I think brie Larson has made some strong,0.06111657
choices here particular you'll note well I don't want to give anything away and I,0.11141842
like to realize some alot here by the way she is a team player but,0.06517454
still a big gun she had some really cool moments and I think taking her,0.40335777
character in this direction works with her performance here and the other choices that Larson,0.070439324
has not only made on camera but I would say off camera as well I,0.10222983
think this is gonna work out real well for her now every single character here,0.11274886
gets a chance to shine thanks to a very strong script by Christopher Markus Stephen,0.031448584
McFeely and in addition to character moments and development this movie has it all there,0.043504525
are also some very clever story elements as well and I was very impressed with,0.0665296
where I was like oh really I didn't even see that coming that's so smart,0.11677423
there's also real danger which I appreciated that something I feel has been missing from,0.08764923
a lot of Marvel movies again I gasped several times from concern I actually I,0.15433708
was on the edge of my seat for a lot of the movie but I,0.07196041
actually was biting my lip for part of it I was like oh no oh,0.23590592
my god it was great I loved that stuff and there are also real consequences,0.07258163
and Markus and McFeely feely are asked to do so much with the script and,0.069670476
they do it all and they do it organically very very impressive now as for,0.05055663
my favorite characters it's tough to do without spoilers but I'm gonna give you a,0.09977361
quick list here again without spoilers Chris Hemsworth just when you think there's nowhere else,0.085550584
he can take Thor he he blows us away again he's got that thor ragnarok,0.2527186
magic and momentum going hardcore oh so good my dad is a particular Chris Hemsworth,0.09239835
fan I know he's gonna be thrilled when he sees this movie Scarlett Johansson I,0.09083757
can't talk about it Wow Paul rah I mean I know that was very loud,0.07863455
if you're listening to this on headphones but that's the best way I can communicate,0.11111132
how amazing so the Scarlett Johansson stuff is here Paul Rudd and Mark Ruffalo Mark,0.20785044
Ruffalo Wow Wow the stuff with the Hulk Wow but they also really do a,0.06796396
lot to bring some some humor and balance it out you know with the with,0.07806048
the with the seriousness of the movie both of them are incredibly funny Karen Gillan,0.24052419
Wow nebula has quite the meaty storyline and is involved in some of the really,0.09420213
clever plot points like again Wow as for Robert Downey jr. and Chris Evans I,0.08630958
can't give really anything away here so it's hard to talk about them but let,0.10732985
me just say perfectly poetic Wow again Wow Spielberg Ian and Wow that's those are,0.085756525
the terms for Avengers end game now finally I'd also like to add there were,0.07661594
many times watching this movie that I wished I could hit pause or rewind to,0.18272619
take it all in to see my favorite characters charging into battle in detail I'm,0.06686923
like if this was a comic book panel I could take a moment and look,0.1501274
at each character and be like oh they look so cool and that's totally how,0.04152481
they would fly or go into battle so here I'm looking forward to seeing it,0.08192415
again I have my tickets on Saturday but I you know even that won't be,0.06697358
enough I really want to get my hands on this and pause certain frames and,0.15084702
then also there were amazing moments that I wanted to see again immediately because I,0.062842324
just couldn't believe my eyes and in some cases my good luck that it was,0.08199446
actually happening I was like wow again wow I think the rewatch ability of this,0.09803129
movie is off the charts as I said I have my tickets for Saturday I'll,0.06423665
definitely be watching again with again with you guys and watch along when it comes,0.043664966
out on streaming but I couldn't even see myself seeing it a third time it,0.18601917
has instant classic scene after instant classic scene and the scenes also mean something which,0.073956236
is just incredible I don't think avengers endgame is going to win any Oscars outside,0.07845682
of maybe VFX maybe you know some of you were asking me all is this,0.15675056
Best Picture material but you know what Back to the Future didn't really win any,0.051959064
Oscars either just for sound editing but that doesn't mean that avengers endgame is not,0.047352005
a truly special film and it highlights how unique it is what Feige has built,0.08781793
with the MCU over ten years but not only its uniqueness the fighting art not,0.060750887
only recognizes the strength of what he's built but has the ability to actually do,0.059776586
something with that to spend that capital it's just amazing it just shows you know,0.051314194
that AMC was running a marathon not a sprint and what a juggernaut they have,0.17986356
truly become and I always say that they are a juggernaut with strong business decisions,0.17906195
but I hear I feel here they're creative decisions match the strength of their business,0.05860688
decisions and when you have strong creative and business decisions you're pretty much unstoppable which,0.15052068
is where I think the MCU is right now and on that note I think,0.06839449
that this movie is a worthy challenger to Jane Camryn's films at the top of,0.11323372
the box office the all-time box-office and I think Avengers endgame deserves the honor of,0.0715114
being the highest-grossing film of all time and I truly hope that it breaks into,0.06791487
the three billion dollar club I think it's worth that and that's how it would,0.11281702
stand out instead of an Oscar totally deserving I suggest seeing the film in 2d,0.090799294
that's how the press screening was they didn't even let us see it on a,0.05701716
big screen it was like a tiny little screen in 2d and I still love,0.13774428
the thing just make sure you see it see it as soon as possible to,0.059833474
avoid spoilers because I also tweeted it's an impossible movie not to talk about because,0.10249595
it's just so exciting so someone might give you a spoiler but they can't help,0.105220206
themselves so as I said if you come up to someone who is or a,0.275618
couple or run into someone online who has seen Avengers endgame just politely excuse yourself,0.22789605
do yourselves both a favor don't let them ruin the film for you and don't,0.26384932
put that on them because they don't feel bad but they get up themselves again,0.15253368
and so oh by the way oh so there are no good bathroom breaks that,0.122808315
you're just sorry you're out of luck every look every inch and every minute of,0.31089434
the movie is important you can't miss it I'm sorry so who took just make,0.08196967
sure you don't have to go to the bathroom during this movie so good luck,0.12501715
avoiding spoilers and I'll see you back here very soon for the spoiler review until,0.1913894
then leave your thoughts down below no spoilers I will be trying to monitor the,0.14335525
comments as best as I can and deleting spoilers don't do it and if I,0.170475
see you putting spoilers I will block you as well so but enjoy a spoiler,0.6323485
