oh my the liberties taken with the Marvel Thor mythology I was very surprised but,0.028664758
I guess when you've made over 12 billion at the box office this Kevin Feige,0.05390848
has done wow that's quite a that's quite a feat he's a Hollywood superhero you,0.03352459
can do whatever you want and it does saddened me to some degree to see,0.039888404
the comics become the cart rather than the horse when it comes to these characters,0.028616866
but that said I did feel it many times while I was watching this movie,0.024370333
from the very opening scene that I was reading not just a Thor comic but,0.013977504
a very good Thor comic and while Warner Brothers is trying to learn Taika Waititi,0.041405022
away as we speak for a live-action akira which I totally get by the way,0.08537898
many times during the film when I didn't feel like I was reading a Thor,0.012799464
comic well just really on the planets a car basically but for the four fleeting,0.023725105
moments I was like a live-action Akira oh there it is again I mean he's,0.0521484
kind of in some ways already done the groundwork for it but I would really,0.039544504
like to see Tyco with TD stick with Thor as I think he'd do a,0.041534733
fabulous job exploring the nine realms and all its fantastical elements like frost giants light,0.029822178
and dark elves etc I already said oh my when I opened this review but,0.13413163
if you're reading the current Jason Aaron run on thor ragnarok with rustled ottomans artwork,0.040520325
shout out to wrestle daughter min the artist on my my own comic super via,0.13818325
but I think Taika Waititi would do a fabulous job bringing that that very colorful,0.036940973
fantasy stuff to the big screen which is kind of to some degree what he's,0.039150715
done here now this is a non-spoiler review and I was again genuinely surprised a,0.012890594
handful of times while watching the movie and I think that it was a mistake,0.044757545
for Disney Marvel to release this film across the globe and what's essentially a two-week,0.030253217
rollout that's such a slow rollout because I feel that without the surprises this film,0.07603515
is going to seem weaker than it is and the surprises are too big too,0.03464609
important too well I think that what's really without giving them away what's really a,0.024810685
big deal about them is what they're going to impact there gonna have on the,0.02877385
MCU going forward so there's no way that you're gonna be able to avoid them,0.038425665
I mean good luck to you but it's just not gonna happen I mean I,0.061212193
already went in as early as I did knowing some stuff particularly about the end,0.02530425
credits sequences which you know really are known on and credit sequences and I would,0.021349069
I wish that I had not known even that and it did lessen the impact,0.03881945
for me so good luck to you and Marvel Marvel and Disney really shouldn't have,0.04163983
put you in that position now why would thor ragnarok seem weaker without it surprises,0.053094957
well that's because Taika Waititi is still growing as a filmmaker what have you correctly,0.029965859
interpreted my emoji pre-review right when i got out of the theater and that's the,0.024130868
thor ragnarok is a colorful funny party with good music it's like the first guardians,0.040813006
of the galaxy and I'm very specific with that distinction the first over the second,0.026048591
and I'll explain that in just a moment but the very first trailer for Thor,0.022805156
Ragnarok which rocked the world made the movie seemed a little grander a little more,0.044661094
epic a little more revolutionary than it actually is I mean when Kevin Feige said,0.04070724
he was gonna take more cues from James Gunn I had no idea that meant,0.0406374
he was basically gonna duplicate James Gunn and if Taika Waititi is indeed following in,0.07970364
James Gunn's footsteps and that means there's a knock out emotional moment like with yondu,0.039722107
and volume 2 on the horizon for him but it's not in this movie there,0.02281846
is a difference by the way I want to clarify between James Gunn and Tycho,0.03597912
with TT James Gunn is more lowbrow frat boy humor whereas Tycho with TD is,0.13445291
more quirky highbrow humor which I prefer so that's why I like this I like,0.04815863
this much better than the first guardians of the galaxy although that was a huge,0.019076137
hit so I'd be curious to see how this one comes across now again this,0.15037407
is a colorful party with good music and I wore this shirt by the way,0.035845418
intentionally for this review because I feel this is this would fit in with the,0.037752498
movie very well right it's a big bright loud pig shirt that's fun to wear,0.16482519
but I would like to add to that description cuz the more I thought about,0.02423663
it what I'd like to add to that is it is a colorful fun funny,0.032863397
party with good music and good friends that's a really important distinction that is something,0.01025048
I did not expect in the film that was a really pleasant surprise and that's,0.019241767
the camaraderie I mean we're sixteen movies and a decade and at this point when,0.028243698
it comes to the MCU Wow and the tremendous payoff there which I only notice,0.031659417
with this movie Taika Waititi is the first to do something with it and that,0.046720505
is the depth of the relationships that have developed between these characters the shorthand that,0.010179305
has developed what they still don't know each about each other which is very telling,0.027374968
and also their relationships with us all of those things seem very real in this,0.03715982
movie for instance they're some of the quieter moments in the movie particularly when Thor,0.024966339
and banner catch up really you know that was the closest this movie came to,0.019275026
kind of like emotionally hitting me and the more I let it wash over me,0.3400858
the more of an impact it kind of makes I think this you know I,0.055311352
wonder how this movie would do with repeat viewing I want to see it again,0.03476449
it could actually you know I think maybe I think it's just a fun as,0.03095299
I said a fun party who doesn't want to spend more time at a party,0.044093695
but these little moments do shine and I think that I wish that Captain America,0.07316554
Civil War had had had a better grasp of this because that was supposed to,0.050823357
be a whole newly about relationships these specific relationships but perhaps the problem there is,0.014717188
that that will be focused on the - that's right - most self-involved members of,0.024690952
the team Steve and Tony Steve is very self-centered and so seeing the Avengers not,0.08335084
only as a team but as an experience through the eyes of Thor and Bruce,0.022870343
that was fascinating and I'm telling you that yondu moment is coming for Taika Waititi,0.03858664
if he could do that here you know what he did achieve now another reason,0.025604248
that Taika Waititi has to stay is that I didn't get it off of anything,0.019419372
the movie goes by very quickly at a very fast clip and it has a,0.02628074
huge cast and so I could have used more time with each and every character,0.040798374
in fact it really is two movies as many of us suspected I would have,0.019159285
preferred that they had had an entire movie about hella and an entire movie about,0.07804533
Planet Hulk it's Planet Hulk and I almost you know I felt I'm sure Hulk,0.017723817
fans will feel feel it right here if you want to you're gonna have an,0.02787186
emotional moment when you see Hulk you know perhaps his greatest storyline taken away from,0.028739925
him and given to Thor and also stripped of a lot of the emotional heft,0.04190391
and seriousness of that story but you know it still it was good you know,0.035283335
I think considering the problems with the universal situation and a Hulk movie could only,0.029447015
be distributed through them this is the best we're gonna do but and I would,0.08477499
like both those movies to be directed by Tyco over TD so again because no,0.0312031
spoilers here are my quick impressions of the top characters in the movie Chris Hemsworth,0.025948148
as Thor I've always said when I especially you know right after the last Avengers,0.026289389
movie I was like you know age of Ultron I say Whedon gets it he's,0.08399473
the only one who gets it the strength of both Chris Hemsworth in Thor is,0.013458661
comedy well Tycho would Tina gets it too and it makes such a difference I,0.027754787
mean he's here the character is finally realized to a degree that allows him to,0.023209589
stand shoulder to shoulder with cap and Tony cap and Iron Man the way they,0.020611381
were supposed to in the very first Avengers movie Thor is always lagged behind boy,0.08454085
did I have fun watching him fly with me on earth that was just a,0.06442769
side note that was a great no saw some great moments but you know again,0.03699951
you know truly realized on the silver screen finally a cate blanchett as hella it,0.055287402
was such a joy to see a female character with not only so much raw,0.15753745
power but who wasn't afraid or ashamed or hesitant even to use it it was,0.028700013
so great if I was going and cost you this year for Halloween I totally,0.03274167
go as hell up just the way she walked into a room and owned it,0.39723417
just the way she forget face acting Kate Blanchet does I acting it's amazing I,0.081587434
hope she's part of the MCU for a long long time Jeff Goldblum as the,0.032896657
grand master one does Jeff Goldblum not improve a movie although even more impressive was,0.05340959
that there were a couple of times here where he didn't just seem like space,0.03564054
Jeff Goldblum but he actually blended in with the movie that was pretty neat Mark,0.028738594
Ruffalo is the Hulk I'm sad to tell you that you've seen most of his,0.02506678
role in the trailers and the clips that doesn't make it any less fun but,0.0107566845
I would have preferred more I mean he has actually pretty small role in the,0.05416391
movie and I'm getting pretty tired of his almost relationships Banner you tease and then,0.08685037
Tisa Thompson as Valkyrie she did as much as possible and makes quite an impression,0.03464875
with what is a very underwritten role and as it's presented here quite frankly unnecessary,0.027865209
some of you have asked me about that her her saying that Valkyrie is bisexual,0.26598775
in the movie no she's not it was never hinted at once and I don't,0.04305534
know why she would say that it just it distracted a little bit from her,0.06374854
character actually to be honest with you because she kept waiting for that other shoe,0.08011339
to drop and it never did so in some ways she didn't feel fully realized,0.07257486
because Tisa Thompson put that out there I will talk about all of them and,0.07116002
everyone else in the movie more in the spoiler review but finally the last thing,0.035610605
I want to talk about here is the score which I just purchased it's so,0.053817347
good by Mark Mothersbaugh it was one of my favorite things about the movie in,0.049709175
fact that I can talk about in the non-spoiler review and it's the perfect fit,0.02564017
for I wrote this down very specifically for a quirky offbeat sci-fi fantasy that wears,0.06478157
it's hard on its sleeve downs me to buy the very large mug and laughs,0.11682155
with a glimmer in its eye as it Pat's you heartily on the back while,0.1139433
telling a good story that's what the score is like that's exactly what the new,0.020597411
Thor is like and what his new movie is like and it's perfect I actually,0.031082036
do feel that this movie could be captured in the in the glimmer and Chris,0.021528004
Hemsworth's eye it's perfect so I highly recommend thor ragnarok just realize the stage at,0.033001754
which this movie is in and also with the stage title with TD is in,0.01343937
as a storyteller I'll get there but this is very very promising it is one,0.033570487
of the most entertaining MCU films I've ever seen and I really I hope that,0.029526837
Kevin Feige can hang on to Taika Waititi and that the Thor trilogy starts here,0.023629984
this just seemed like a fresh start for the character and I would hate for,0.060388032
this to be where he I mean if he has to go out on this,0.052076563
note with in terms of his solo movies fine but I can't you know speaking,0.019989435
of cap and Iron Man of the three of them no one deserves another movie,0.04786462
more that I think Thor I was very very happy with it I want to,0.028008888
see what Taika Waititi does next specifically with these characters so that's my non-spoiler review,0.028482499
for Thor Ragnarok leave your own thoughts about the movie down below please don't put,0.055518888
any spoilers please let's try and do our best even if Disney Marvel did not,0.068126775
alright so again write those thoughts down below and you can check out some more,0.045877717
