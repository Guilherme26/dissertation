weekend fifty million dollars a good premise and a good review goes a long way,0.06770378
back the story is about they don't really give too much on the origin of,0.08493495
these creatures but apparently they I don't know how much of the population they wiped,0.66511494
out they leave that pretty vague but these creatures are extremely sensitive to sound so,0.23494858
if you make a noise they're coming for you and these creatures come for you,0.25279725

happened and what they look like stop hiding these creatures I hate when they hide,0.31089434
the creatures I'm done with that just because it worked for Jaws doesn't mean it's,0.047587622
gonna work for every horror movie Jaws isn't working I know why they did it,0.14978638
for Jaws it's cuz it was too complicated to show you this mechanical shark they,0.1244434
had brewing so they kept everything under the surface cuz I watched the first 10,0.072627
minutes of the Steven Spielberg documentary and he told us that's why you see less,0.06516164
of the shark and luckily it paid off a lot of filmmakers like let's do,0.08001966

that if we were in that situation what would we do and there's not a,0.049423654
lot of dialogue as you could expect they can't talk I appreciated that I appreciate,0.113594666
a movie that's quiet the only thing is you can hear people snacking people were,0.15392381
snagging to do but whoever was behind us was really digging in that popcorn like,0.072043575
if the monsters that it truly existed and they couldn't hit a movie screen but,0.1781838
they could hear the audience oh he would have got scooped up mid port of,0.035764784
popcorn in your hand if the movie is mad silent okay we heard every crunch,0.23967482
every bag did or just that one person everybody else on the would they were,0.15014438

monsters that they do show they were scared like the monsters were scared and if,0.31089434
you're gonna have a movie you gotta be scared of the creature and hey and,0.32750458
I was like man these preachers are scary to look at alright now the question,0.36711252
is a lot of times when when horror movie set up this this lovely premise,0.113241225
in this awesome world and they run out of steam at the end is that,0.081927225
the case for quiet please I was satisfied with the end because they explained the,0.06620349
situation and then you know you got to figure out how to do what you,0.065248206
got to do to survive once they figured it out everything else made sense the,0.08124764
question is we don't know how big the world is so there's room for you,0.16748099
know more but I don't know but I was satisfied with it they didn't run,0.10344986

of dialogue to enjoy a movie I don't need a lot of talking man so,0.1687641
movies they over talk and when characters talk too much you start not to like,0.09374807
them and then you don't care if they live or die if everybody is pretty,0.6712182
