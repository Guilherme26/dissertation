inside out is Pixar's latest film and it's directed by Pete docter who made up as well as Monsters Inc two films like clearly enjoyed and it tells the tale of a young girl named Riley who's in a very hard spot in her life she's moved from Minnesota to San Francisco,0.18167254
she has no friends it's a new school,0.41105083
and she's starting to go through that period in which she questions herself,0.15416652
she gets snippy with her parents,0.46041077
and while all of these emotions are affecting her we go inside of her brain,0.6045633
and see these emotions personified as actual characters,0.1178751
we get to see how joy and sadness and anger and disgust and fear all interact as actual characters inside her brain controlling Riley and that's all I'm going to say I don't really want to actually let you know the plot of this movie,0.3605116
what actually happens the things that take place because I think this is Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3 this movie reminded me of the old days of Pixar clever original fresh unique ideas that are actually very mature surprisingly mature and surprisingly making me cry a lot in all seriousness,0.12075646
though this film actually goes very deep it really gets underneath the psyche of what it's like to be a kid in that strange period where you're starting to question things,0.13966602
and you're starting to figure out that youth is just youth and that could float away some day and those weird and awkward phases you go through in that strange period of adolescence leading into puberty and all of the hardships that come with that and I expected it to go in those directions,0.1497392
you know cuz the main characters are emotions,0.06815458
so I figured okay it's gonna be emotional,0.0700649
I may cry it might be intense,0.15345854
it could be a little like boy,0.1321218
that's a lot for a kid's movie but I had no idea how mature this film was going to be I was so pleased to see a kid's film a family film,0.07240034
that doesn't pander to children,0.14773417
there's no useless pooping farting burping jokes to make kids laugh and to be like yeah kids aren't gonna really like this movie unless we do something stupid every two minutes,0.80837625
it's nothing like that this is a film that actually respects kids minds,0.10060127
and as the scroll experiences things throughout this movie it gets really emotionally complex,0.06829572
and the way the filmmakers chose to express these emotions and these thoughts and things within her memory,0.07334446
it's so clever that I don't even want to spoil it for you,0.31089434
I don't want to talk about it at all,0.11510759
I want you to just see it and be like that's awesome,0.11742746
I'm so glad Chris didn't tell me that because now I can just watch this movie and experience it without knowing too much because it really benefits from it not knowing because I barely watched a single trailer for this movie and I'm so glad I didn't because I didn't really know what this movie was even about and it made the film so much better than if I would have watched the trailers,0.048747074
I can also tell it's a kind of movie worth,0.14898615
I was like six or seven years old right,0.06936349
now I would be really entertained by inside out I would think it's a lot of fun,0.10399713
but then as I grow up and get older I would start to recognize the more deeper elements of the film,0.078906156
it would grow on me in a different way it wouldn't just be a fun experience,0.12530372
it would actually have a deep impact on me,0.15856935
and that's why inside out is so special,0.08953954
it's a movie that adults can enjoy as well as kids,0.2608603
but a lot of people say that oh adults and kids can have fun,0.09433825
please quote me in the trailer and on the blu-ray cover but I really mean this movie is actually in some ways more aimed at adults than kids kids can find a lot of enjoyment in this movie but it also reminded me in a way of Toy Story like when I first saw Toy Story,0.08843496
I was like oh Buzz Light beer,0.061473217
that's funny,0.07338683
I don't know what that means,0.13214567
but then when I was like 15 I was like a ho Buzz Light beer,0.07162281
I get it now,0.06460136
it's a movie that kids as they grow,0.18059091
older will continue to find things to appreciate,0.0780249
and it's not at all a movie just for kids,0.1502509
if you're 45 if you're 88 you'll probably really enjoy this film I was shocked how good it was,0.09548185
now this is a Pixar movie so you know technically it's going to be gorgeous,0.13603312
the animation is beautiful lush,0.09560698
and breathtaking the 3d also of course looks great for an animated film the depth of field is amazing,0.11336542
and as it stands out everything looks really good,0.09567062
and of course those are the things you expect going to a Pixar movie you expect state of the art technology and where I used to expect back in the Finding Nemo and up days with some truly heartfelt emotion that really got you right here in the fields and we haven't had that for a while and inside out has reminded me what Pixar used to be and can still be,0.07579057
and is I really hope they continue to make movies like this because inside out is one of the best family films,0.10133559
I've seen so far this year two issues,0.075120665
I would say the first 10 to 15 minutes were a little slow,0.24142031
after the main plot which I still don't want to divulge because I think it's so interesting and so different and so much fun as soon as that main plot kicks in the movie was non-stop fun,0.15014073
and yeah I cried twice I'm gonna give inside out an A I strongly recommend checking this movie out it's by far Pixar's best movie in years and don't get up right,0.16847506
