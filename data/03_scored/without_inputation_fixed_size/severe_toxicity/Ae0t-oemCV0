were to describe this movie as a Starbucks coffee it would be like a soy,0.033975586
a mocha frappuccino with like sugar-free syrup and that's how this film feels where it's,0.031782474
designed to keep everyone happy where it have ticks all the boxes it's funny it's,0.048757963
sad the more female x-wing pilots there's more Asian characters it has dark parts it,0.10799921
has light parts and there's a wings and I get it as a content creator,0.06717091
myself I can relate to what Disney is doing but there has to be a,0.012781504
line drawn at some point where it is impossible to keep everyone happy and I,0.034930788
know them how I do with my channel you know someone is going to dislike,0.12794608
something I do or it just won't agree with them but Disney don't have an,0.03909883
objective that this film just feels like a statistical analysis where it just feels synthetic,0.033341
there's no heart in it it just literally just feels like a tick list and,0.031906866
everything that was missing from the force awakens has cut being slightly crammed into this,0.032711737
film and to me it's kind of it's quite obvious while my main prompts of,0.056007132
the song is it feels very bloated for one it has far too many characters,0.022805156
you pretty much have the original cast from the force awakens sweet girl I Bray,0.1437861
Luke kylo hots Leia Snoke Poe Finn Chewie mouths phasma c-3po r2d2 a bb-8 and,
that's excluding all of the new characters on top of that and if you compare,0.045362197
that to saya a movie like a like the imposter a smack that has pretty,0.22653049
much a cast of ten maybe plus a few extras like Boba Fett so when,0.15660019
you compare that with double the mass action double Man the jokes that doesn't leave,0.046920057
much room for kind of character development for example Finn story arc is almost completely,0.02573928
unnecessary I mean you could probably remove it from the film and it wouldn't overall,0.027392263
make any impact anything you could just have his character in state to sleep for,0.045688804
the whole movie and it really wouldn't have made much of a difference almost the,0.014865524
same goes for Luke's Marquez character I just found he was just heavily underutilized they,0.02694526
have had Morphin or just done more with him and I just found it was,0.058418423
a wasted opportunity they could just cram so much more Luke Skywalker in that film,0.095733896
but they chose not to probably cuz they're afraid of bringing back too much of,0.051602285
the old cast but I honestly I don't from there I've been a massive problem,0.049808286
how many Star Wars fans would you say would ever complain about having too much,0.015599222
Luke Skywalker in a movie the last Jedi also tries to be funny it's not,0.049056627
quite as effective as a film to say like thor ragnarok cool and you ever,0.083154604
got disney like properties where you know has lots of cute animals and it has,0.032947212
cuff the force awakens when has they've heard these little quirky funny parts but I,0.093873374
just felt just don't feel it was quite strong as the force awakens in that,0.022178553
department that means comedies subjective so some people probably disagree with me on that but,0.026503578
I honestly don't think it was quite as funny it was a quite fuse the,0.06167516
jokes were a little bit hit-and-miss well it feels like it's dialogue it's clean a,0.07486575
little bit made more for children like sums the lines to try remember snuff them,0.088759445
out one character says snuff them out or let's go chrome-dome or of course they,0.058063217
use like more familiar ones like you've read like rebel scum but I will never,0.48062128
that scene it will never be as good as the scene in like Return of,0.053146843
the Jedi you rebels this movie almost feels like clickbait where it builds up quite,0.12653057
a few great moments and this is really really big build up from quite a,0.01746373
few scenes but then they go and waste it we've all the characters development and,0.043198355
everything this film is so much potential to being great like the second act there's,0.035246752
some interesting character development between rain burn and also kylo Ren I won't go more,0.027823966
detail than that but it is it was going somewhere is really cool and they,0.018613834
don't really use it very effectively and there's quite a few lackluster moments where you,0.14247368
think there's a what were you thinking it would have just been so cool if,0.02468563
they had gone a different direction but they didn't officer that's a personal preference and,0.009983742
obviously being a fan of the franchise everyone cut wants things can't go a particular,0.03634896
way and how they imagined it so when it doesn't then obviously it feels more,0.01684112
disappointing I understand that but for this I honestly think they could have done a,0.05848827
lot better I'd assume the resources Disney have they could have done better I obviously,0.021513369
think it's a little underwhelming I find the film's biggest weakness is probably its plot,0.10575289
I don't go into spoiler territory but it pretty much revolves around a starship fuel,0.0329818
and stalling for time it's filled with deus ex machina ray is still a complete,0.07388926
MarySue if you're not familiar with that term it pretty much means a character who,0.022285648
does nothing wrong there's everything pretty much correct every time everyone likes them the pretty,0.13198641
much near perfection so much to a stage where you can't actually relate to her,0.016655533
and she's very similar to that as she wasn't the force awakens and they haven't,0.070051156
kind of correct to that problem whether I recommend the last Jedi if you really,0.05199807
like the force awakens then yes it looks great it's fun it's funny I'm sure,0.05444927
you're pretty much enjoy all of it but if you're like me and you found,0.08102203
that the force awakens was her like lust a remake off a new hope then,0.106263086
you'll probably think it's okay maybe you'll hate it but I can say that at,0.11839404
least it's not a carbon copy you know it has its own original content and,0.022503162
it does take a few chances here and there but as I said before it,0.018789442
just feels a little bit bloated I think too many characters there is some hope,0.042847805
there is progress hope maybe the third film it will be completely its own thing,0.040218998
100% and they won't need to steal scenes from other films they don't need to,0.053135537
you know they've got so much content there's so much resources they can do anything,0.040049378
they want hopefully an old for a public movie or something like that that'd be,0.12858266
brilliant see ya so they are getting something but yeah for me I just think,0.06069335
it's a good movie well I want to see it again a time soon probably,0.043902785
not maybe a year from now maybe I'll watch it but I had that same,0.015136254
effect with the force awakens so that's your benchmark really thanks for watching guys and,0.015940461
as always I appreciate the supports and if you like the video then by all,0.034525692
means like it and subscribe if your face suggestions please let me know hopefully I,0.08814548
