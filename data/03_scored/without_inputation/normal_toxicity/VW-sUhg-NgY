part to some fun lovable and investable characters notable favorites to me are miguel dante,0.06053322
and hector but that doesn't mean that all the other supporting characters are just as,0.024506604
fun and memorable the themes of this film are great as they tackle the ideas,0.09965853
of family versus heart life and death these both play into the story of this,0.3213867
film which is one of Pixar's most detailed and human stories so far it's such,0.10802012
an original ideal with the typical twists turns and heart-tugging moments that Pixar is known,0.05352676
for this film may not have the emotional effect that up did in its first,0.07048099
couple minutes but it's a slow burn to a very emotional conclusion all I'm saying,0.21168576
is bring tissues the story is nothing without its main character the animation this film,0.13776849
shows why Pixar is the best in the business the intricate detail in the land,0.052372362
of the dead to the light cast by candles and scenes it looks closer and,0.11444134
closer to reality and that's a hard thing to do and the story is accented,0.09217701
by a phenomenal score now it may not be as memorable as frozen or Moana,0.07399682
but Pixar does what they do best and make a phenomenal story and add the,0.04928694
supporting character of the score into the forefront however the only net picky thing that,0.06126737
I can really say about this film is that it's the same Pixar mold that,0.098968714
we've seen time and time again and this story at its barebone cons is a,0.074883156
very overdone and retold story but at the same time it's a family animated film,0.092282996
so do we really care that much and that's where I'll end our spoiler free,0.12678584

spoilers first off I love that this film tackles the idea of morality and life,0.15073983
after death it really puts things into perspective for children who don't quite know where,0.34440398
their ancestors go when they pass on so this film really shows a beautiful expanded,0.07813421
afterlife without throwing religious overtones on it I found that the reveal that Hector was,0.15499553
Miguel's true ancestor was fairly predictable Miguel is watching Ernesto de la Cruz play on,0.14721136
his guitar and you see on the guitar that there's a skull and in the,0.33795625
skull there is a gold tooth and that's the exact same gold tooth that Hector,0.20651399
has in the land of the dead so that was very easy to put together,0.124376774
on top of that it was kind of predictable that Hector would need a more,0.14148398
prominent storyline other than someone who's just gonna show Miguel around and the best scenes,0.101100236
to me were the introduction to the land of the dead Miguel's attic shrine his,0.13002059
performance at the Plaza and the final emotional moment where the family is all together,0.048310056
