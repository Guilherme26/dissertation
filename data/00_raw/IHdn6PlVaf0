[Music] I'm telling you Wars of Commons Knights of the Ku Klux Klan that's us Stallworth brothers so I'm a big fan of Spike Lee I am I am he's directed some of my most favorite films of all time but in 2003 sir you tried to adapt this film right here all boy something that I found in 2013 it's a Korean film and I did not like your adaptation at all but you came back in 2015 with chiraq I love that film a lot of people actually tried to crap on it but I appreciated everything that you were trying to portray in that movie and your adaptation of your own film she's got a heavy that you did in the 80s and read the elation on Netflix that was pretty good too but now we have black Klansmen where you are calling out the KKK is this gonna be one of your greatest films of all time or is it gonna be kind of mediocre less find out my name is Brenna keep Avery and this is just my opinion hey what's going on everyone thank you so much for tuning into my opinion slash review for black Klansmen I really do appreciate it now like I said in my intro of this video this feeling bless Klansmen is being written and directed by Spike Lee I am a big fan of his I love do the right thing inside man Malcolm X especially I pretty much love all of his films except for that adaptation of oh boy which I'll talked about and this film is also being produced by Jordan Peele I'm a fan of Jordan Peele as well he first popped on the scene for me just kind of being a comedian and that's how I say he popped on the scene I really wasn't a fan of his but I really became a fan of his because you know Jordan Peele wrote and directed get out which came up with like February 2016 and he or excuse me February 2017 and he won best I think it was Best Adapted Screenplay for that film and it was very well deserved actually when I first heard about this film I thought Jordan Peele was gonna be the director but Spike Lee ended up being the director now this film less clansmen is based on a true story that happened in the 70s we have a black American by the name of Ron start work there was part of the Colorado Police Department that was able to successfully infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan in that chapter and actually become the leader and when I first heard about this story pretty much just like everybody else I was just like oh just you know kind of taken aback like is this is this real is this kind of like some fiction fairy tale or something like that like Django Unchained or you know like like is this some type of fantasy but no this is like a real true story now they did Spike Lee did take a few liberties with this film like in real life it took place in 1979 but in this film he decided to put it in 1972 and that's just because you know he wanted to take advantage of like you know and showcasing like all the trendy blaxploitation films that came out at their time and it was just a number of other reasons too now what's crazy about this film to me and I'm gonna say crazy in a good way is the mixing of all sorts of tones I mean this has a very extremely strong political message of course it deals with racism I mean that's blatantly obvious and just this with a lot of serious issues but at the same time this is not a film they just kind of beat you up and beat you over the head to where you're walking out and you're exhausted like oh my gosh man like oh I can breathe now that was tough I mean I'm glad I watched it and it was tough no no it is nothing like that it is nothing like that movie Detroit which came out last year that Kathryn Bigelow did that also starred starring John boyega which I really did enjoy the film but I kind of said to myself like okay this is a great film and I enjoyed it and you know our like that I got a little sense of history but I never want to see it again you know unless you some type of homework assignment because you know this as a black American myself you know you don't really like seeing your people getting their ass beat and raped and tortured and killed and all that good stuff so but the good thing about this movie is that it is not like it is very serious tone at times but at the same time this film has a ton of levity to it I mean I you know some people are something I never really do before I give my review before I give my opinion is we'll watch other people's reviews because unnaturally you know you will sometimes mimic what they say and put it in your review but for blacks Klansmen you know I really couldn't help it and there are other people just saying you know hey you know I don't want to call this movie a comedy you know but it does have funny mom I said I'm just gonna go ahead and go therefore and call it a comedy two of me it is a biography it is a crime story a little mystery in there too but it is a comedy as well and I just got to give Spike Lee some kudos there's some accolades because I just really think he just did a great job of balancing the serious things you know in this movie as well as the comedy and mention it together you know not in the microwave but in an oven long cooked meal that's just been soaking for hours and hours and hours he did a great job there now Ross Starr worth is being played by John David Washington if you did not know already this is not John this is Denzel Washington's real biological and I reacted to this trailer a couple of months ago and when I first reacted to the trailer I did not realize that that was that was Denzel Washington son or whatever I cut it I was kind of watching it and just kind of thinking to myself you know you know that's I don't know that was kind of some similarities there but actually when I turn the video off and was doing my editing process that's when I realized there and John David Washington he did a great job in you know he's actually been in a number of Spike Lee's films before work or Spike Lee dear macro mix which came out I believe in 1992 off the top of my head I want to see the 94 or 92 I feel like I should just note it off the top of my head but John David Washington was actually the little boy in the in one of the classrooms and they're seen but now he's a grown man 34 years old just had a birthday in July 28th and he did a great job I mean the guy it was just fantastic on screen there was times to where he sounded you know you can hear his father coming through his through his voice you know at different points in the film and of course that's you know only natural I mean you know there's a father-son relationship but when the acting did get intense in this film you can just hear all Denzel you know I was just kind of smiling and intrigued at the edge of my cell okay get pumped up in the mood I feel you my brother you know and you know it's John Dave Washington but you hear you hear heard nothing on but Denzel but besides that I'm and I just started to say hey you know if you are fan of busy Washington and you like his movies I mean that's just another reason for you to come see this movie - because Denzel is a great actor and so is his son and I'm definitely going to be paying attention to this man in the future just some other films that he's been in or other material I believe he was in ballers when I looked this up Earl and I'm just yeah he was in ballers he was also in the Book of Eli and I don't remember him in the Book of Eli or maybe no he was not in the Book of Eli he was a Malcolm X love bees roms Monsters and Men months Black Panther and he has something that's coming out there was an arrow it's completed the old man and the gun and I don't know anything about that I just learned about it as I'm clicking this shooting this video but I'm definitely going to be looking him up from now on but he is great in the film I love this character it you know this is a real life character you know I saw a side character I love this portrayal of the character he can you know act his ass off also in the films just something that I liked about him and I don't know if this is a liberty you know he was just kind of like a smooth-talking brother just very confident of himself and there's something that I can respect and you know he looked great on film and somebody does that he looked great on film with his Adam driver you know they the Adam driver played somebody by the name of flip let me see the yeah flip Zimmerman a real Jewish person in real life of course because this is based on a true story Adam driver is great you know he is kylo Ren and the Star Wars films he also played and I'm ton of other things I'm a big fan of Adam driver too the chemistry between these two characters on screen was just perfect there was one scene and like we said guys when others film this with politics and racism and hate and bigotry and a bunch of stupidity from the white supremacist and the white extremists okay so you have a black man and you have a Jewish man two of the most hated groups on the planet I would say black people more but there was just a scene in between these two you know a black man in the Jewish man just like you know hey not the kind of comparing their plight and how they're gonna deal with the white supremacy this scene right here was just kind of one of my favorites because it was just kind of like a wake-up call to me and it'll be a wake-up call to everybody that's just like I mean look man you can't just keep going through life you know being in la-la land trying to ignore things acting like everything's okay there are people out there that hate me they're people I thought I hates you and they want to kill us for no damn reason why don't you act like you have any skin in the game I mean this was just a very powerful scene in me and I really like that I really like it besides all the comedy that was going on the screen because I was just laughing my ass off out loud at a number of points in this movie some of them that were actually in the trailer when you see them in the trailer they're not as funny in the movie that's not the case here I was still laughing so bob was laughing and ron Stallworth and adam driver i was also just really just kind of rubbing my chin like man this is a deep-ass scene right here not like this you know give me more yes yes yes yes yes something else that you know I hear people complaining about not with this movie just with movies in general is that they don't like it when a movie is too preachy but this film is preachy but I liked it in a good way and it felt organic and just another character in this movie another actor that just kind of like brought that to the forefront and this did a great great drop excuse me a great job is Corey Hawkins who is playing a qualm mates hooray who is a Trinity I keep saying a real-life person everybody in this movie is real so I'm gonna try not to say that anymore just have someone saying I'm kind of excited he wants array is a here's one of the people that helped with the civil rights movement you know decades and decades ago he's a global pan-africanist born in Trinidad you know they had Corey Hawkins playing him in this movie Corey Hawkins played dr. Dre in the Straight Outta Compton film directed by Edgar Greta came out in 2015 and he was also play in the film Kong Skull Island I think that came out March of 2016 with Jason Mitchell was well who was instructed to Compton did a great job did this seem right he was another part of singing you know I mean and we've seen movies before they talked about you know black liberation and freedom and black power and i'm black y'all and i'm black y'all and i'm black and black and you know we've seen that before and i'm not saying that i get tired of it but you know in this particular scene and just really this horror movie they kind of just take it to another level you know and i'm just gonna go ahead and talk to my black people right now you mean you know we you know we really just kind of messed up in the head you know we have self love for ourselves but at the same time you know there's still a lot of self hatred you know that we have to deal with you know because was the brother Kanye get out the single place from birth they made us hate ourselves and loved it well for me and that is just still a problem that we did with day but in this fear on man you're just gonna be looking at yourself just gonna be so proud to be black you know I'm saying and I'm not saying if you wired are you brown on you yellow or whatever they are red that you only got to be proud of being that too but I'm just saying I mean this right here is kind of just focused on black people right now and it's just kind of just so unapologetic you know I'm saying Spike Lee is pulling no punches he is fearless and getting his message or crossing his movie he don't give a goddamn about what anybody got to say and you're just gonna be just like when Corey Hawkins is in this movie doing his thing and I don't want to spoil it for you you're just gonna be like hooking yourself like oh yes black man but like woman I love you yeah I mean that's how I was gonna make you feel and in the way that he did that with the visuals and telling the story when this is going down I was just really spoke to me you know I'm saying and I'm just like you know why this brother is talking to me you know I'm saying he waking me up I know I already thought I was somewhat won't because like we are all at different levels of consciousness you know as we were going through life and learning this and learning that and with this the political climate that we have going on and I want to go ahead and give a shout out to a field scout with the advice show because he going around town by man I'm so glad the president Trump is an office right now and the benefit of it is that the truth is coming out and you know black people are waking up and doing research and just going back to their roots and things like that you know so just like all that I had another point to make but I'm just going a million miles a minute right now I I kind of forgot what I was gonna say but that's okay cuz I still have much more to say but like just a way like there was something that he was just kind of doing like there was like the speech going on like you know with these floating hair saying I just really like the way that was depicted in this film and it just you know like really spoke to me so Corey Hawkins did a great job of course John David Watson did a great job Adam I loved him as well Lord hairier now she was somebody that she's a black panther and fear her name and this real-life name is Patrice Dumas she did a great job too and I did not know at first until after when I was trying to do a little research after film that she was the least character in spider-man homecoming which came out last [ __ ] and at the same no she's a I think she's a black and white beautiful mulatto young lady I think she I think when I looked it up she's 28 years old I did not know that and so I was looking at this film right here loved earnest him I really wasn't paying attention to her like that in spite of me at home come on cuz she was playing a high school student so I'm like okay you know cute girl but you know you leave at that you know but she looks like a grown woman in this you know being super black or whatever now I loved her in this film is with her portrayal she did a great job I have a lot of respect for her as an actress and you know she will be on my radar too as far as casting a son I'm just talking about black people or the protagonist of this hand but we also got to talk about the KKK because this filmed is with Ron style worth infiltrating them in there becoming the leader meeting up with David Duke or whatever let's talk about David Duke who is being played portray about Topher Grace who was in that horrible spider-man 3 is venom he also done a 70 show did a great job as David Duke I mean really great actor this is like perfect casting and there are some other actors that I want a mission is where by the name of Ryan Agarwal and Jasper I'm not even gonna try to pronounce his name I just wanna say Pat come on but I know that's not right he's from Finland I don't even yeah they just did a great job as well too and I just really liked what Spike Lee was able to do with this film is that we really just got to see in a good sense you know the inner workings of the KKK the Ku Klux Klan nothing to know the filmmaker has ever done that before but it even got as deep as you know we get to see them you're doing pillow talk in just with the KKK I mean they go around with regular clothes on you know but - how the robes and things like that but I mean you just never know you can be at the grocery store at the gas station and you know you need to see a white supremacist you may not know that because they have on regular clothes but you know at night they like to burn processes it's like that when I what the point I'm trying to make is Spike Lee did a great job and I'm not necessarily saying I'm happy about this in in a real sense but it did a great job of just kind of showing how the white supremacist and the KKK can hide in plain sight and how they're not all the same I mean you know you will probably want to think that a neo-nazi or take a care of some stupid knee Angela neanderthal just gonna roll oh well you know drunk all the time with no teeth to things like that no I mean you have somebody in this field I mean like I was like is this a real person I mean every word that came out of mouth whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo and I'm not exaggerating at all like I'm just like me you are really just pathetic Nelson had a KKK person ever just crazy I always just ready to fight but then they also had just somebody that was just kind of clean-cut and just kind of calm and collected or whatever so they all did great jobs and their performance but I just like to dynamic there of how you had all these KKK people you know portraying the roads and it was all they all had the same cause which was [ __ ] racist bigot Rachel racist bigoted hatred but they did a great job in the role and that's just you know something I like this so across the board the casting is great and I really did love all that this film dresses a lot we have Alec Baldwin you know how in the very beginning of the film there's kind of like a little shorten oh I don't want to spoil the feeling for you I don't want to do that but you know there was an address to the nation and this this this family's really kind of dives deep and breaks to the ocean floor through the Mariana Trench just to kind of get down of destructive ridiculous you know insane mindset that these people have to have to think that you know they're righteous I mean that they're just just insane and they found nothing wrong with it I mean you have some crazy people that know they're crazy but you also have some people that are crazy and they have these views and they they really think that they are the sane ones or whatever you know that was portrayed great through Topher Grace's performances David Duke Alec bomb and Alec ball Alec Baldwin is will something else that I really just loved in this film is the soundtrack okay I talked about earlier how Adele kind of kind of gave some accolades and Shawn some butter on all blaxploitation films rah got some old 70 songs too I've got some temptations in there got this and that I thought I wrote down the person that did the music and I guess I did not write that down here in my notes so I do apologize but I have to look this person up real quick because they did a great great job I saw this film Thursday night and Friday all day and work at my day job I couldn't I will keep playing the song over and over and over in my head just I'm not doing a great job they're trying to you know put all the melodies together but it would it would it just it's in my hair right now just a great great soundtrack but the gentleman's name is Terence Blanchard I just had to mention him oh he's a brother as well yeah I just had to mention him cuz I he just did a great great job and apparently he's what he's worked with Spike Lee in all his films as I'm finding out right now he's a composer he's blacks cleanse man shot wreck Red Tails that wasn't directed bus that was director Bob was a George Lucas of the George Lucas right that feeling let me see real quick okay Anthony Hemingway directed that okay maybe I don't know what I'm talking about but let me get back on point and let me find my cursor real quick but anyway this brother right here Terence Blanchard you know look him up or whatever YouTube you know he did he did a great job with the music score you know I love that of course this film has the n-word in it they say [ __ ] whole bunch so if that makes you uncomfortable you know this film probably won't be for you but you know you probably should have known that already of course the SuperDuper Pope back something that really spoke to me is when they uh there was a mention of w/e beat the boys and how he talked about double consciousness and how if you are a native black in this country a black American a descendant of slaves how you can grow up with a double consciousness you mean you have your black self but then you have yourself that tries to cater to white society and the and that accepted that was a scene in that that talked about that double consciousness and it just really spoke to me and I'm just like man but with this family my hip man I woke up like 12 times you don't I'm saying like open over and over again I mean while I was laughing at the same time there was times where I was they set the edge of my seat just kind of eating all of that in editing in this film is superb Spike Lee is able to mix things together and transitions him very well especially with the score I mean you have one scene ending but you bring in this music and hear all this dialogue and sound effects and sound editing from something that is not applying to you visually but then and and you're loving what you're seeing but at the same time you know you're kind of salivating at the mouth like waiting for the next thing to come because he's kind of pulling you in and this is something that I mean I've seen that before but the way he stretches it out you know in this film particularly is just something out okay you know astrick right there that is something that I'm going to be talking about when I'm giving my review when I get my opinion as I'm doing right now what else what else what else something that is just very difficult I talked about is this mixing serious moments was funny comedic moments and they did that very well I talked about that yeah across like you see I've talked about a good number of things I don't want this thing to be too long but Oh fun facts let's talk about the fun facts in this me so this film debuted at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival they said this sparkly got a six minute standing ovation well deserved they're also the real David Duke actually called Ron star worth not too long ago because he was concerned about his portrayal in the film and yeah the real David Duke called the real one Stallworth was about say Oh David Duke also the rostov also said that David Duke tell him that he has a respect for Spike Lee I was like well I wouldn't expect I would inspected and contrary to popular belief rust our one start worth actually used his real voice he didn't fake you know he didn't you may we all know about coal swishing things like that we black people trying to get a job and I ha yes I'm Brandon Avery uh-huh my email is yada yada yada yeah we all know about that or whatever but in this film here and in real life you know he said he did not use his he did not use his real I mean he use his real voice he did not try to offer his white voice and what's also funny isn't there justice in the film no no I don't want to spoil anything it because it's just great it's just be better for you if you just go in and not know anything um another interesting thing was yeah I don't wanna spoil that now I'm not gonna say that because that's just a good moment toasting him but the real David Duke did not realize that he was infiltrated until 2006 that's you know I guess he did a great job there and yeah I talked about how the film actually took place in 1979 but also took place I mean in real life it took place in 1979 but in the film they brought it up to 1970 so but guys I was kind of teasing out the intro of my video talking about is this movie's gonna be good man this movie was off the damn chain I cannot wait to see this movie again I cannot wait to buy this movie I'm gonna go see it by myself I'm gonna go with my mama my daddy and my brother my friends my family I'm gonna go see this movie a whole bunch more with people just so I can gauge their reaction because that's just something that I really did enjoy this is actually one of my most favorite Spike Lee films easily in the top three is up there with mónica mix and do the right thing I like inside man too but not as much as this right here and then the ending of this film is so great we also got to see Spike Lee's signature trademark shot I was waiting for it too but it came right at the right time I don't know if it's a if this is the technical name but I saw somebody call it the person moving shot I kind of called it the glider you know and and and our two directors especially like sparkly they all have the signature that they can put on something and you know he did that you know with this shot I like that I also really like the very ending of this movie it was so real it was so unapologetic it was so necessary it was so like I said necessary and in relation to the climate that we have today and people that are in power and things like that I mean this was a fantastic film um I don't know if I'm gonna go as far as to say I liked it better than Malcolm X I may have but at the same time Malcolm X has one of my most favorite scenes in movie history when they beat up the black dude and he's in the hospital and Malcolm s get all of his Muslim brothers and sisters or Muslim brothers in this particular film they all suited and booted and then marched down to the hospital all in unison and he's like the white cop is like you know he's all right get him out of Aaron you know Michael he holds hand like this and points or whatever they alternate me and that's a call that scene right there oh so you know sparkly is this in art or if I had to write black lensman out of a 1 out of 10 I'm gonna give it a nine point five out of 10 yes a nine point five out of ten no bump there I'm giving this thing a 10 out of 10 a 10 out of 10 cuz I was like I can't there's nothing that I can you know I'm good I like this movie you know it's like 2 hours and 15 minutes and I loved every second of it so perfect 10 out of meeting Spike Lee I don't think I gave a 10 I think I gave a 10 last year to that movie about our the the origin of Wonder Woman comics or whatever but yeah this movie ten out of ten I love that I think you would too and I cannot wait to see it again and I hope I don't not forget to say something because I'm I'm always this one's I turn up a creme I'm like I'm crap I forgot this mission this and yeah I got it but guys that is just my opinion for spike Lee joint a blast Klansmen what did you think have you
