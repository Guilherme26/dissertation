is probably one of 2018 s most anticipated films so does it deliver [Applause] in,0.020890757
this one the villain inadvertently opens up a whole bunch of dimensions and all kinds,0.10076268
of spider-man come in to Miles Morales dimension and they're all stuck there that's the,0.062350325
whole story now they need to get back before they die or disappear or whatever,0.24365668
it does because they're not in their own dimension and before Miles Morales is Chris,0.047373716
reality crumples and destroys have you seen any of the trailers the animation looks a,0.19531322
lot like a comic book it almost has this 3d feel to it because you,0.10955109
have some of the color shifting in the backgrounds and then you also have a,0.011708562
lot of halftone going on and so it really makes it feel super like you're,0.042406786
in a comic book and I loved it at the beginning I thought I was,0.053541295
going to not like it so much because some of the colour shifts really messed,0.06925826
with my eyes but it was in the background enough that it didn't you know,0.035231452
I noticed it but it wasn't my focal and so I thought yeah okay it,0.0511473
looks like it's totally 3d like I'm gonna wear 3d glasses and then it's gonna,0.07226023
have all of this depth no it was just truly to make it more and,0.020693863
more like an actual comic book the movie itself is visually stunning but also without,0.034358732
being overwhelming to your eye I mean there is a lot going on in several,0.055342615
scenes especially that climax where there are a whole lot of colors and there's just,0.1087389
a whole lot of action going on and really you could just kind of get,0.022953492
blurry eyed and like you know go cross-eyed but I run the the filmmakers really,0.21617204
did a good job of animating it in a way that still you were able,0.026416438
to keep your focus and know what you're supposed to see and as the other,0.020842198
things happen in the background they don't draw it away but they certainly had to,0.028811099
it it's a great story and I love how they intro the other Spider people,0.06436982
because they give us some background without delving too deep so that we have enough,0.06663677
knowledge of who they are and what they're about and their kind of backstory and,0.025165228
how they are in their universe but it doesn't spend a whole lot of time,0.027600465
on it I felt like I had a well-rounded just grasp on who each one,0.084703155
was enough to care about them but not so much that it becomes their movie,0.03575096
or their the focal point I think one of the best things about the movie,0.03251085
ins one of the things that I liked the most is that it has a,0.018341774
such a great message and it really is all about team and it was a,0.016277708
positive team message throughout much of the film and I really appreciated that because it's,0.011831622
you know sometimes you have all of these ego things going on or you know,0.059285823
somebody's gonna be no no I'm the best or whatever it is this though wasn't,0.035188213
that way they were all working towards a common purpose a common goal and they,0.02655147
were building each other up and really supporting each other and I appreciated that a,0.018238004
lot there's some good humor but it is also enough tension and drama in there,0.018896537
to really keep me going engage throughout the entire thing it really felt like an,0.037918795
animated live-action comic book that doesn't make any sense right that is a total contradiction,0.05219563
in terms but that's what it is it's just I mean if you think about,0.022863027
it it's obviously it's an animated film and then it has this comic-book ask part,0.045844458
to it but the characters themselves were so real not realistic not photo realistic in,0.02946298
the CGI or though the way that they made them but just that they had,0.022693405
heart and they had depth to them and I cared about them and so that,0.020844195
is why they made it like they just seemed real to me so there it,0.029832821
is a live-action animated comic book you know the movie is one hour and 57,0.048475258
minutes which is actually kind of long for an animated feature but for this I,0.037816357
didn't feel it at all I was totally engaged the entire time and I think,0.030599779
had they made it shorter I probably would have been disappointed know are there parts,0.043665316
that are predictable yes of course there are but the whole movie itself was so,0.026218213
enjoyable and I liked the story so much and the characters that I'm willing to,0.0232189
overlook some of these parts that I saw coming because I just I was so,0.03234522
enthralled in what was going on overall I think spider-man into the spider verse is,0.04179016
a great film and I think it's one that everybody can enjoy not just fans,0.029804884
of superhero movies or like the uber niche fans of just spider-man I really think,0.04979698
that it has something to offer to everybody I mean it is great animation there's,0.025906907
good humor there's great voice work and just the the overall look and the feel,0.03285741
is so well put together and it is so good and tight that it is,0.016801873
just it's a visual spectacle that I think you should see there's no sex or,0.25903067
nudity there is a little bit of language and some animated violence I give spider-man,0.22216202
