Black Panther was directed by Ryan Coogler and stars chadwick boseman and Michael B Jordan,0.0009841492
and an amazing cast of characters and tells the story of T'Challa played by Bozeman,0.061388724
who is about to be crowned king of Wakanda a secret city in the middle,0.07987616
of Africa that's completely shielded that's thriving and yet no one knows about his existence,0.26881638
and what it first seemed like a responsibility he could easily step into he eventually,0.11016532
learns there's a lot of hardships with being a king of this nation and a,0.062426094
lot of problems arise when his kingship is challenged by kill monger I was excited,0.3220196
for Black Panther for a lot of reasons but specifically because Kubler directed it I,0.15022342
really liked Fruitvale station and I thought Creed was one of the best films of,0.10629964
the past few years for a seventh film and a franchise to be that good,0.050984453
and the fact that Ryan Coogler is basically my age is hugely inspirational to young,0.14974098
filmmakers out there it's so cool that someone who is my age has already done,0.123636186
what he's done in Hollywood his future is so bright and he proves that he,0.15060775
is once again a very good director with this film he's three for three now,0.07431342
Black Panther is a really good time I had a blast with it however I,0.24255325
do not think it is a flawless film and we're gonna talk about some of,0.067725115
the issues I have with the movie that being said there's a lot to praise,0.054568384
and I'm very excited about the fact that this film did not just make another,0.071930036
superhero movie Marvel didn't just take this material and say okay we're gonna make a,0.09087351
movie where some people fight and stuff blows up there's a message behind this film,0.24016885
and one that's very relevant the best Marvel movies thus far have all been like,0.14671068
that for instance Winter Soldier is not just about Captain America fighting the Winter Soldier,0.08449362
it's about war it's about the differences between freedom and fear and what the implications,0.11789557
of that could mean for humankind which is one of the reasons Black Panther stands,0.16934454
out as special because this is also not a movie about characters just fighting it's,0.0654981
a film that has very relevant social commentary sure there's a lot of action sequences,0.06574452
and stuff goes boom and there's cool costumes and gadgets but I also don't like,0.10234641
when a film preaches to me I don't want to go to a movie and,0.2404371
necessarily be taught a lesson that the film assumes I didn't already know which is,0.023531204
why I was so relieved find out that this film's commentary relies on the characters,0.105217725
in it looking inside themselves the characters in this film are really thinking about their,0.10169326
viewpoints and what was wrong about their lives or their nation before T'Challa took the,0.13898891
crown because almost all of T'Challa x' development relies on him realizing the sins of,0.11967541
the previous generation and how he can make them better it's not just about walking,0.07084945
into this perfect nation where his kingship is unchallenged and everything was thriving and amazing,0.11330777
it's actually about how damaging his previous generation was and all of the problems that,0.11810832
came from that this is not something I expected and by far my favorite aspect,0.096527465
of this movie is how these characters eventually get to the point where they are,0.057989992
looking at themselves and trying to figure out how they can make their lives and,0.12881018
their friendships and the world better as a result and a lot of that has,0.06650842
to do with this film's villain it's one of the reasons why Michael B Jordan,0.11227566
character kill monger is so damn good because his appearance in this universe is what,0.7692075
starts this needed change for this nation and although he's a villain and he's doing,0.36544764
things like killing innocent people and you look at him and you think no I,0.768597
don't agree with that you can almost side with kill mongers beliefs because you understand,0.64281315
where he's coming from he's someone who wasn't raised in this protected shielded environment that,0.099512964
is Wakanda he was raised in the United States he dealt with all of these,0.09957074
problems as a youth and now as an adult he's standing there like hey you,0.27584657
guys have all of this technology why aren't you sharing why aren't you helping everyone,0.12956998
else and these characters have to stand back and think about that and that's one,0.053588055
of the reasons why kill monger is such a great villain beyond the fact that,0.44218582
Michael B Jordan gives a charismatic performance that's one of my favorite Marvel villains thus,0.12953366
far and the best since Loki the reason his villain is so good is because,0.15054409
just like all great movie villains their appearance in the film is what causes the,0.08738667
heroes to look within themselves and realize their weaknesses the worst villains in films are,0.24891293
the ones that are just they're evil guys and you got to stop because they're,0.50507855
gonna blow up the world kill monger is not like that he's the type of,0.6351164
person who comes on the scene and it's like I have these beliefs and I,0.16876067
hope you all understand that they're totally relevant I might be kind of evil and,0.4929289
I might be killing innocent people but listen to what I have to say and,0.8060606
they do and it's one of the reasons why kill monger is such a great,0.42223346
villain so beyond the thematic issues that are prevalent in Black Panther I also like,0.14953274
a lot of the behind the scenes stuff Kubler once again enlists the same composer,0.062637806
from Creed who makes a fantastic score I loved in particular the percussion the color,0.13190751
in this movie is vibrant everyone the city of Wakanda has amazing costumes it's a,0.08682382
gorgeously shot movie it looks incredible and once T'Challa starts to look within himself and,0.24013598
realize the change that has to happen I thought Bozeman did a really great job,0.12996034
leading up until that he's a very kingly presence he purposely does not have a,0.15327413
lot of charisma necessarily although he is really great in this role the character of,0.026364582
T'Challa is one of the most intelligent in the Marvel Universe and he carries himself,0.14905718
that way he's not an he's not some cocky a knowing guy likes a Doctor,0.49911195
Strange or Tony Stark he's an extremely intelligent person and that can make some of,0.14259528
those earlier scenes with him feel a little bit dull because you're waiting for him,0.47324315
to realize some things because from the very beginning of the movie you recognize that,0.05494133
eventually some development is going to occur within this world and once it starts to,0.09783788
occur the film becomes very interesting leading up until that development though the film does,0.040038425
feel unfortunately a little bit like your normal superhero movie which was something that was,0.29550475
a disappointment for me yeah I do have some flaws with Black Panther and we're,0.23969582
going to get into some of those now this film is surrounded by an almost,0.10061064
impenetrable hype to the point where people who say anything negative about the movie it's,0.07440076
almost like a crime the very few rotten reviews that are on Rotten Tomatoes ended,0.40336546
up trending on Twitter which is just crazy but I'm someone who reviews movies and,0.34282184
naturally I'm going to try to do my best to be realistic about that this,0.05992878
film has issues it felt like instead of hitting us right off the bat with,0.15073629
some of the deeper issues in the film they made a normal superhero movie for,0.053327028
while to get everyone else sort of into it which was disappointing I wanted this,0.20047194
type of stuff from the beginning yes the opening scene is awesome and from the,0.046732035
beginning I was pretty riveted but then it becomes a Marvel movie for a while,0.108634666
there's a chase scene involving SUVs that's well done enough but it just sort of,0.040961485
feels inconsequential there's a lot of action scenes that are a little bit too dark,0.14761537
and not quite as fluid as I was expecting from a director who made one,0.13126376
of my favorite fight scenes in recent years in Creede that one take boxing match,0.11614514
but there is a point in this movie where the film absolutely changes and becomes,0.042583693
a much more interesting film and it's right around when kill monger rears his head,0.69542736
once again towards the middle also that was a disappointment I had he shows up,0.1520335
in the beginning in a really cool scene and I was instantly hooked with his,0.08663349
character and then he's gone I mean I've only seen it once but I would,0.07753357
say he was gone from maybe 50 minutes to an hour almost and I was,0.08840111
like where the hell did he go when he shows up I was almost like,0.53490317
oh I forgot I was in the film I loved his villain so much this,0.21592075
movie needed a lot more of it there were also some CG elements that looked,0.07354333
unfinished there's a shot early on when T'Challa is about to receive his crown and,0.1605683
he looks up at a clip side that is filled with people of various tribes,0.12961484
of Wakanda and they almost look like copy and pasted elements that were just put,0.08270533
on the frame it looked unfinished and if it was just that one shot I,0.15302068
would have been like okay whatever but they show this cliff side many more times,0.1870707
and each time I kept thinking that doesn't look real there's a climactic fight towards,0.12129065
the end that begins with a shot that looked like it was right out of,0.31089434
spider-man 3 with the two characters falling down tumbling over each other in the sky,0.13760549
and then they fight in a very dark cavernous area and they have very dark,0.1082347
suits on and it was hard to see what was going on and looked like,0.071701474
a lot of CG this was a major disappointment of a final fight for me,0.19575961
a lot of people will probably be fine with it but pushing that aside what's,0.10041031
really honestly amazing about this film is that looking back on it I am not,0.09614796
thinking about the action like I do with some Marvel movies I'm not thinking about,0.15435958
all of the cool epic moments I'm thinking about the things that shape these characters,0.06852009
into who they become the things that affected them the aspects of their life that,0.103664905
caused them to have the beliefs they have so I have to commend Black Panther,0.47676155
because it stands out as a superhero film where I'm not thinking the most about,0.09719903
all of the superhero stuff I'm thinking about the characters I'm gonna give Black Panther,0.13722222
a B+ I'm buying the blu-ray I'm gonna see the movie again in theaters but,0.06716999
it's not a film without flaws and I think it's important that we are able,0.05600166
to discuss those flaws without fearing repercussions because the hype as I said surrounding this,0.0731162
movie is impenetrable it's almost like it's wrong to say anything bad about it but,0.08863821
in the end it is a movie made by people and it's got a few,0.14406125
issues but I really enjoyed myself and I think most people will too guys thank,0.08570011
you so much as always for watching and if you like this you can click,0.1858115
