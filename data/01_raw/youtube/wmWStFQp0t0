hello and welcome to the flick advisory today we're going to review Logan now Logan is directed by james mangold Logan is said to be the final portrayal of the character Wolverine by Hugh Jackman this is the ninth time he's played the character I'm starting with 2000s x-men action was really the first time at least 20 Century Fox kind of took the comic book movie seriously x-men kind of redefine the comic book genre they're the first ones who really put a lot into the comic book movies I've seen they could actually be more than just silly comic book movies if you go back to that first x-men that I protection actually touched a lot about the political and social issues I'm all being under the veil of mutants versus people but the whole movie is really a civil rights movie you know if you think about civil rights communes so starring hugh jackman Patrick Stewart returns as Professor X Xavier and introducing Daphne keen as Laura I'm also knows x-23 hey why not okay x-23 is a clone of Wolverine that they got wrong 22 times then they decided to try to make it a female you know playing around the chromosomes and filing the 23rd attempt to make a Wolverine clone it works oh I can't much like you know one of the things you want to take note is that this movie is loosely based off of the the comic book old man Logan it's loosely based because there are elements that the movie can't take away from the soy and then the elements of the movie doesn't take away from that particular story that story has the all the Marvel now all of a model but that story has Marvel elements and Marvel properties that 20 accessory box cannot use such as the whole Hawkeye those things belong to Marvel Studios you know in their original series and stuff like that and so 20th Century Fox took the old man Logan feel and adapted it into a story that they could actually use with their properties I'm so you know there is no Wolverine finding the hoax you know children those things don't happen in this sir there's no blind Hawkeye driving wolverine around so in that sense is there an immediate adaptation of old man Logan it's more of a rethinking or loosely based off of that so here you have Logan he's an old man he's an old man you know imagine you know Charles Xavier now a really old man this matter of fact he's kind of going see now he's got dementia or Alzheimer's he has a degenerative you know the kind of brain disease here and Logan is taking care of him they have so like a father-son relationship almost all the other x-men are gone they kind of a little to a reason about why that's happening we'll get into that later so it's really just Xavier and Logan full of full majority the movie until lower comes along Laura needs help getting to this other place with these other kind of upcoming mutants are like a safe haven for them anytime you are come on come on everyone has come along now a lot of the things in this move we work really really well as talk about those things the direction in this movie the tone they decide to take this is a this be first rated our x-men movie are you can say Deadpool if you want through Dipple is a raid on comic book movie and he is kind of an excellent Your Honor me but this is actually something that we've been waiting for for a long time it was nice to see Wolverine on the screen back in two thousand it was just it was just a neat thing and it has been cool ever since but you kind of wanted a little bit more you kind of want of the edginess of that particular character to really come through and they tried it a little bit before with 2013 the Wolverine with james mangold also directed it tries to bring you a more ground in a more serious a more mature wolverine character and after the release of Deadpool which was rated r 20 Century Fox decided they could take a chance and tell a more mature adult Wolverine story and so here they had to take that and run with it at a rated r level and for that the movie doesn't hold back and let me give you everything you something we've been waiting to see you know for the last what 17 years you know when Wolverine you know stab somebody you're selected that somebody with this cause you know finally actual blood comes out hey you know it's not that clean clip they clean cut album you know what would you slice it you cut all right of the wound at the exact same time we got to a point where I was almost like insulting our intelligence so we finally get the blood on this and another thing this movie just hurts there's movie physically and emotionally hurts they bring you along with these characters you know you've already known you know Wolverine Logan you already know professor extra now you get to really spend a lot of time with them because it's mostly them before the other x-men movie here you're sharing screen time with real storm Jean Grey rogue you know Cyclops do you know all these other characters finally we get to sit down with really the characters we've enjoyed the most and to spend time with them and fill for them and let them take you along the ride if some when bad things happen to them and there's allows bad things that haven't told in this movie when bad things happen to him you'd get there and it hurts you it is sort of an emotionally draining movie almost like I said with my princess review as even as a movie you're just high you need somebody to help you out of the seat because you're exhausted and it's a good thing I mean it's effective storytelling it's good acting it's a good direction I was good writing Hugh Jackman against us as well he's got to know this role by the bathroom you know like the back of his hand by at this point you know plane is character nine different times but he actually brings it to a whole nother level this time because Wolverines out of place in his life that he hasn't been before there's no more glitz and glamour there's no more team even though he wasn't the biggest team players there's no real team to fall back on none of that is just hear my professor actually trying to take care of them and Professor X you know Charles Xavier and you know Patrick Stewart playing him again gives another outstanding performance um he's an old man even-even older man he's beginning to go see now so but you know somebody who hazards of you know uh who's going through this you understand what a bad day is for them you know they don't remember you were you trying to tell them hey you know this happened back in the day they're like I'll remember that but no when Charles Xavier has a bad day you know with the mind that he has when that mine such a deteriorate it's not just a bad day for him that's a bad day for everybody in like a five-mile radius when I try to think about things that don't work in this movie I really I nothing really comes across you would think maybe the thing you know the child actor Daphne King you'll think maybe you know sushi or the one below and the movie she works really well she gives things across a lot of times without dialogue you do believe her as this savage now know now you know somebody confronts her you're kind of expecting they might have something for her but nah nah you know when she goes off she goes off and then Wolverine almost almost have to catch up to her you know because you know it's his movie too so no she absolutely does a great job as well I really had a tough time thinking anything bad about this movie in any kind of points to dr. down and really the only thing i have i have two things i kind of wish they had they wish they had expounded upon one and movies Wolverine sick you know he's not healing i wish they kind of told you hate this is what's wrong with them this is like not healing this is returning them but they take the mature they make they take the more mature well you know you know it gives full out of Schilling and they kind of allude to it and they say hey take that for what it is and run with it and also what happens to the rest of the accident you know in the movie it's Caliban Wolverine and Professor X and there's no other mutants really the speaker and you wonder what will happen to the other mutants weapon to the x-men once again they allude to it they tell you how you know just this is probably what happened here but we're not saying it definite when I'm saying in indefinite terms I again at the moment shear out I understanding your audience is talking about all the time you know like things you know spoon-fed to you I kind of wished they have spoon fed me this one but I can live with it it's the more mature around it's good storytelling I get it because this movie is essentially 17 years of the making I have to give it a night out of 10 this is something we've been waiting for for a long long time they finally delivered it to us in a near perfect package it's like when we first seen the spider-man in in civil wars like this is what we've been waiting for and so that's why spider-man stole that show we learn that whole movie this Logan is what we've been waiting with you know excellent fan comic book fans have been waiting for for a long time and they gave it to us and uh nicely wrapped bowl so what do you think of Logan do you think maybe it was too sad you think those two series for a comic book movie do you believe that this has to do with Deadpool success let me know in the comments please hit the like button subscribe and more reviews coming to you I took a quick break because I have some dental work so I didn't really feel comfortable talking on the camera while it was hurting I want to get into it away so Logan nine out of ten great movie might be the best so far thank you [Music] you
