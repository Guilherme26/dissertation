Roma,0.015933098
I did not have a lot of expectations going into this film,0.13047181
and I can say it is a very very slow,0.16172169
burn,0.48732644
this is almost a two and a half hour film and you're gonna feel every minute of that but I can't say I did enjoy the cinematography,0.09757026
there are a lot of beautiful shots in this film having this film being noir,0.18345028
I think it was really smart and I think it really worked for the film not a lot of films,0.08304976
nowadays are in noir if they are it's not in the theatrical release even though this was on Netflix,0.114690416
it's still what I call it,0.09068464
but if like they are nowadays it's on the DVD on like a special features bonus disc and even then it's not that often,0.078518406
so I think it worked really well for the film and I think it was really nice but something I really got tired of in this movie is the constant slow turning shots,0.12548742
I like this director and I have seen two of his other films gravity,0.080781825
and Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban and I remember multiple shots in gravity where he used the same slow turn technique,0.12987027
but in this film he really doubled down on it I get that it could be an artistic thing,0.18330076
but with how slow the movie is I really started eh,0.116307884
I was just hoping to see a different type of shot,0.3271643
the main character and her family,0.037273534
she works for all go through some really tough relationship stuff throughout the film and I'd say that the main character gets away worse,0.1498836
but the whole film in general is about this maid in her relationship to this family she works for into her own relationships somewhere in the middle of this film there's a scene of a riot breaking out and all these civilians just start killing people with no reason the film doesn't tell you it might be an actual historical event but I don't know I know it was just a weird scene that I feel like it was only used to put more tension on the main character who's going through something,0.42237362
I won't say without spoiling the film at that point in the film I was also really disappointed with the ending our main character just ends up back where she was in the beginning in the film with a better connection to the family,0.06434566
she works for but she's made no progress making a better life for herself which at the end of the film I would have really liked to see,0.12321976
so with that said I'm gonna give this film a 7 out of 10,0.11950099
it's super slow and doesn't have the greatest any,0.15617137
but it's still a good film not a film for kids,0.1165758
but a very good Oscar bait movie,0.07313297
well that's the review I hoped you guys,0.09090636
enjoyed it,0.07194845
