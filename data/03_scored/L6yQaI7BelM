ladies and gentlemen we had a Mission Impossible movie without Tom Cruise let's talk about,0.1682133
this script I got mixed feelings about this script because there's things that I love,0.079629004

this script I loved how they were able to transition most of the truth over,0.057472195
and present it to me I hate it they added BS to fill in Lord,0.60454196
knows what then the reason why I hated it because it was obvious it's like,0.15445742
not that Najee what no this movie nlgger I know the difference I watch a,0.24877046
lot of film I know and I hate it the fact that they say they,0.33031762
should have just kept it 100 if you say Oh movies based on a true,0.028514376
story then nlgger worth word scene for scene needs to be true and they didn't,0.17247547
do that they added bits of it which sort of just as I just said,0.07128346
this movies based on true events these are actual characters in real life doesn't the,0.07013278

nlgger connect he's I think he's a very underrated actor because of Star Wars and,0.40313646
people were not really speaking on him but I've seen him in a couple of,0.1702722
our roles and Adam driver knocks it out the park every time I really enjoy,0.09168557
seeing him in this movie he played a undercover detective named Flip Zukerman and he,0.111626305
was Jewish but you know how some people you grow up Jewish but you don't,0.46050307
grow up Jewish that's your religion that's where you're from that's when you that's what,0.53490317
you are but you don't push it is like being Christian Laudes people Christian but,0.39529315
they don't push it and I really enjoyed seeing him cuz he played the opposite,0.16660619
ron Stallworth he was the white guy who when it was time to face to,0.43259263
come face to face with the Ku Klux Klan member that's what they that's what,0.38937044
he sent and I think he did a hell of a good job and it,0.47638816
really showed me his acting chops topher I think did a decent job but nlgger,0.5487166
he's Eric Foreman and everything he does my gosh he's Eric Foreman and everything he,0.15831324
does my nlgger he has not changed one bit every time I see him I,0.5154597
think of read from that 70 show every tyronn ik for his movies in the,0.28741926
70s John David Washington this is the first time I seen him in anything and,0.087651424
I'm have to say this he sucked in his movie I'm gonna give her another,0.8113849
chance though it's the first time I seen him but he sucked in his movie,0.7317658
his voice was annoying as nlgger he was corny as nlgger his costume design was,0.79799634
wack as nlgger and his jokes were wack as nlgger overall he was wack as,0.5493636
nlgger I didn't I couldn't understand it I was like why how what I'm like,0.28567713
don't stop it aah whack aah he sucked in this movie and it hurt because,0.6245294
he was the star of the movie I'm watching him over and over just sound,0.09451097
corny his voice was so annoying and it was at a point that we accept,0.7377174
and we were like is he doing this on purpose and then we we went,0.05496483
and looked it up on you oh my god he sounds like that there's parts,0.22565632
of this movie that really make this movie bad and let's just say his voice,0.26936278
he sucked make him another chance though my semen something knows this was not a,0.9156528
movie for him I could nah nah nah he sucked in his movie man if,0.70631623
Adam driver wasn't in this film I would I had a horrible time he sucked,0.8006654
his everything up it just was bad he was bad let's get on other parts,0.33630008
the directing Spike Lee does a spike Lee joint yo Spike Lee on a directors,0.10263037
perspective did good but because it's Spike Lee I'm not gonna give you that good,0.1239166
credit you did bad because you know there's certain elements of this movie that Spike,0.1936664
Lee just refused to capture and regardless of the movie Colin called Black Klansmen showing,0.017428055
the Ku Klux Klan and then show the Black Panther black power on it all,0.51824164
that good stuff he refused to make this movie feel black it didn't even feel,0.43671742
white this movie had no culture to it it's showed us as a director when,0.31089434
you see certain scenes where black people were being abused black people are are coming,0.69542736
together in spirit hopes and hopeful spirit and they're joining forces for better cause and,0.0426043
you see the racist cops trying to destroy that saying hateful things you're supposed to,0.62000406
feel some type of way when you hear the word nlgger nlgger nlgger uh what's,0.42705938
to call it pick a nanny or something like that with the little pig oh,0.5039848
nlgger you just wrecked me you know I mean you're supposed to you're supposed to,0.7093121
rekt me when you hear the black people coming together my god they put Harry,0.7073621
Belafonte in his movie y'all know him Harry Belafonte had all the nlgger bad more,0.4547343
for the back and a Carmen Jones I know but anyway you're supposed to fill,0.10686357
him when he sits on that charity talks Spike Lee did a poor job I,0.30184793
didn't feel anything didn't didn't didn't get emotional didn't we didn't even have the pride,0.085685596
you know when when when his movie based on some stories so obviously the the,0.07347361
Ron Ron actually survived and one for the team but you didn't feel it and,0.07772247
as a director Spike Lee did not deliver he sucked at that too I know,0.5199596
this is gonna sound nlgger up but this is the truth keeping their sheep on,0.3499019
honey would you be sighs Corey Hawkins y'all know him dr. Dre it's better come,0.15089156
the black actors sucked in this movie they weren't believable the costume designs were corny,0.8355208
the afros look like wigs the clothes the way they dance their vibe it did,0.4503329
not mesh well but the white actors will nlgger out of all ones in this,0.52596605
scene we were like man I nlgger selling races in a nlgger my gosh they,0.49235934
did their part but don't black actors oh sucked they did not feel authentic and,0.768396
it hurt because I didn't build the black coming off of them I felt young,0.5599293
actors trying to make away and it hurts this movie terribly the casting sucked and,0.7153696
the directing sucked because all this nlgger was supposed to happen you gotta remember you,0.8060606
can see it visually but I don't mean you feel it yeah I mean we,0.06000576
watch a lot of movies out here you can see a nlgger get his head,0.65928817
blown off boom clean off but a director and good acting make you feel it,0.33584404
oh nlgger up you know I'm saying you can see a hospital scene somebody dying,0.54808474
on a dead nlgger oh we're good acting and directing make your village uh-huh you,0.49083742
don't die oh he coming back he's dead Lassie you can see it it's there,0.32116598
directly to make you feel it ah you know I'm saying they drop the ball,0.12231001
on that the or the the music Spike Lee literally tried to go back to,0.09504
like old-school Spike Lee with the music and he did not mesh well with these,0.16645102
actors the music was poor ah I was tired of singing it was Ron start-stop,0.1873574
Star Wars had a scene every time you hadn't seen it was a certain song,0.08116234
for him like staff or something but it wasn't not don't take it like doodoo,0.106324635
doodoo don't take it like that but it was more of a you know every,0.14393164
time he had his scene it was that that that music that played with play,0.10597315
them play with him I was annoyed you should remind me of school days and,0.26004353
nlgger like it was like stop it was like do the right thing he was,0.5441377
like stop I was like Michael Max is like stop brothers stop stop stop aah,0.3619032
he killed me and then he did that one shot you know when Spike Lee,0.60954684
and you they move forward but this up enough pro and cons the movie has,0.04903041
great elements to it visually it doesn't hold up to certain points the white cast,0.15091994
it holds up the black cast it doesn't directing Spike Lee did good but because,0.2328704
of Spike Lee I'm not not freak that you did bad I was expecting more,0.29797342
from Spike especially on a piece like this when you see Spike Lee and he,0.08820695
did Malcolm X mmm one of the most powerful scenes at our whole movie Rickman,0.06755824
brings tears my just thinking about [Applause] that's too much powerful one man he did,0.08715923
the pick on he moved and that wake up was like man and not one,0.24524556
not one minutes how I know I know not we gotta do something I felt,0.16649832
it but anyway I hold you up for that kind of seat cuz that shit's,0.9238619
mmm based on some story right did based on true story right when believable this,0.05722462
one with um let's rate this thing black Klansmen has good elements but has a,0.31089434
lot of bad elements but I really did appreciate the story I appreciate it mostly,0.14897953
actors what hurts that the most is the costume design the directing and the star,0.10149443
John Washington not being believable to me personally to me I'm gonna give black Klansmen,0.41456798
a c-minus because that's good trace but it also has a lot of bad ones,0.2609362
and it leaves you questioning the script like why would you write that I know,0.09646989
you added the end but why why is this why is that really hurts the,0.09420261
movie I hope you guys enjoyed the real thumbs this video up don't forget to,0.16123608
