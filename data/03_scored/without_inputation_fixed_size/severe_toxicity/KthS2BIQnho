all reality did I just read Miles Morales out loud as a description for a,0.037790414
movie that is currently coming to theaters is that not the most incredibly geeky and,0.04151012
nerdy and awesome thing you have ever heard this is a character that I've wanted,0.22916803
to see on screen for so long we've had plenty of iterations of Peter Parker,0.018146874
and I like a lot of the spider-man movies I'm a huge fan of spider-man,0.07419392

of all time maybe throw them in towards the end of my top ten I'd,0.62073046
have to check it out and make sure but this movie had a lot to,0.025543053
live up to because it has those other spider-man movies to compete against and there's,0.02787053
a lot of hype for this thing looking on Rotten Tomatoes the score is that,0.085544616

to come in gonna tell some stupid jokes and make this movie a bit more,0.4489246
cheesy than it needs to be there's just a lot to handle and I was,0.06570351
very worried that into the spider-verse could not handle it well a big slap on,0.1079766
the wrist for Austin because into the spider-verse did not just handle those things it,0.037169132
masterfully crafts all of those elements and brings us possibly I am NOT definitively saying,0.10697483
in this video because one I have to and - I may be releasing a,0.023895392
spider-man movies ranked list this might be at the top of my spider-man list this,0.038655818
movie was awesome and I'm not just saying that because everybody else is saying that,0.03460884
I watched Gotti a few months ago am I saying oh it's the worst movie,0.060338143
of the year it's rare when a movie lives up to that kind of high,0.025145272
but god he was one of the worst movies of the year it's same thing,0.12358114

good you have to do a lot of things right so Austin what does into,0.037894182
the spider verse do right well like I said it handles all of these characters,0.04281388
but it doesn't just give you these characters and make them likable it gives you,0.047035802
a great voice actor behind them it gives you a reason to care each individual,0.092871614
character either gets an origin story or gets fleshed out to a tee and the,0.01655376
voice cast is perfect for all of them Jake Johnson as Peter Parker now there,0.047308527
are multiple iterations of multiple different Peter Parker's or Penny Parker's or Gwen Stacy's in,0.025547042
this movie but there are also a few that kind of slip in at the,0.047212075
beginning there's one and at the end there's one with some special voice talent that,0.018760175
you're not anticipating to hear in this movie so keep an ear out or keep,0.088227294
an eye out but keep an ear out for some very famous actors of note,0.040632077
playing some characters that you won't expect and then go check out I am to,0.02182002
be and see who they play after you watch the movie not before because you,0.04953955
will have a massive smile on your face when you hear their voice my goodness,0.0869395
there are so many little things like that in this movie that just make you,0.029951224
happy there are Easter eggs there are cameos if you pay attention to television screens,0.045016304
in the background blink and you will miss all of these things I may even,0.030237254
do a spoiler review for this move because there's just so much to talk about,0.027269203
especially when we're talking about the two and I'll go ahead and get into them,0.040987287
the two post-credit scenes mid-credits scenes the mid-credits scene very emotional it's great but the,0.025076758
post-credits scene may be the funniest most entertaining most jaw-dropping if you're a fan of,0.05758628
certain characters post-credits scene I have seen a long time and maybe one of the,0.024199381
best I've ever seen so if you leave before those credits roll just know that,0.061449
you have made a grave mistake in your life and that is something that can,0.23379728
never be fixed unless you go watch the movie again then you can you can,0.031300217
stay that time and the amount of surprises I continue to get with this movie,0.02073976
I'm not gonna say what any of them are so it's hard to review this,0.111764155
film because there are so many little details and things that I want to talk,0.04559568
about just things that I want to tell you guys about you're gonna love this,0.06087295
and you're gonna love that but these are plot elements that I didn't really know,0.032599986
going in so I don't want to ruin the surprise for you guys I want,0.11617233
you to go in fresh I can save this I don't think this is a,0.040090617
spoiler I didn't know that they were going to be so many origin stories to,0.019130016
these characters in the film well guess what the way that they go about that,0.013084828
is brilliant but the way that they give that to us on screen I'm sitting,0.023451714
there like yeah this is a major surprise 10 minutes later another major surprise just,0.025919545
the way that they handle all of these characters I can't believe it was so,0.018180799
well crafted when I was going into the film thinking this thing could be an,0.031524383
absolute mess it was the opposite and yes you have the brilliant things that people,0.08276481
have been talking about and all of the reviews that I've read so far the,0.011625415
comic book elements the color scheme just the look and visuals in general it's one,0.03316938
of the best looking animated movies I've seen in a long time I love the,0.028046139
style of the characters I love when miles jumps off of a building you can,0.085969
fit and this is an animated film guys you can feel the wind blowing against,0.08565769
his face and you can understand how epic this moment is just from what this,0.071172655
is showing us in animation and it's not even super realistic it's more surrealistic but,0.07313362
I love the style that they went for the backgrounds can be a bit to,0.047098327
get used to because at times they can be a little blurry but they manage,0.046036694
to shift the focus in a way that you know in the backyard while they,0.08901953
mean to do that because they're trying to focus your attention on something in the,0.0356146
forefront of the screen and every single spider-man every version whether it's by twin or,0.025405359
spider HAMP or spider noir their atmosphere their vibe their animation style it's all different,0.02763572
it's all cool I thought all of it worked from that to the voice cast,0.022501167
Nicholas Cage is in this movie he is great Hailee Steinfeld like I said Jake,0.06780816
Johnson shameik Moore as Miles Morales how can I forget about this guy this guy,0.18826427
starred in dope I thought dope wasn't pretty dope and then you have my Hershel,0.20126727
ollie has a very special character in there I thought he was real everyone Brian,0.039255146
Tyree Henry everyone was good there's not one bad actor in the bunch and there's,0.06208558
also not one bad song in the bunch this soundtrack the score all of it,0.09130577
works so well I was visually pleased I was audibly pleased everything you can possibly,0.06756603
think of I was sitting there just soaking it all in this was comic-book goodness,0.09168226
from the panel's popping up in the background to the sound effects to the words,0.03540573
coming on-screen we have never seen something like this the closest thing I've seen to,0.026486948
this you remember that videogame ultimate spider-man I had it on the Nintendo DS I,0.13289239
used to love that game you got the comic book panels you got the transitions,0.04386487
they tried it in live action with the 2003 Hulk that didn't work so this,0.013932272
the animation style animation in general is the way to go about it and they,0.033517275
went about it and they delivered on all of those aspects Austin are you going,0.030261865
to keep talking about positives yes because I have a lot just kidding I'll add,0.035750296
and one more thing I thought the villains selection was really cool and how they,0.08939935
managed that throughout all of the different universes and the color palette the color palette,0.010220546
was beautiful negatives like I said it might take a bit to get used to,0.058015987
the blurry background you might have to have your eyes adjust I liken it to,0.030611752
the lego movie and it's funny because we had Chris Miller and Phil lor the,0.044984374
same guys who did the lego movie and other than that I will say kingpin,0.06605739
while I really liked him I like lifts Schreiber ass kingpin I think he could,0.63968885
have been a bit more fleshed out as the villain although I wouldn't want to,0.04725132
take more time away from the characters that we know and love because I did,0.020381227
know and love those characters but I don't think kingpin was the most fleshed out,0.0319062
villain in the world otherwise I can't think of anything else don't you just hate,0.10862981
being all aboard the hype train sometimes don't you like standing out and being different,0.025850367
well I do but into the spider-verse it's just a movie I don't see anyone,0.029970514
disliking unless you hate spider-man as a character and by the way my friend also,0.20546591
looked at me and said Miles Morales is now my favorite spider-man and this guy,0.05436546
has been a Peter Parker fan for years smooth we might convert you of course,0.018158183
you're going to have many different characters to choose from all of that being said,0.02511401
and I can't believe I'm going to do it this movie is going to be,0.030144792
in my top 10 movies of the year most likely and I'm going to give,0.01522938
this film in 98 percent spider-man into the spider verse did everything it needed to,0.045342244
do and more it executed on the audience that it was intended for it's good,0.22742032
for kids it's good for adults it's good for comic book and non comic book,0.05185572
fans this movie is good for everyone and I'm probably going to go back and,0.05398298
see this again next weekend just to make sure I like it as much as,0.019867705
I think I do but my goodness this thing blew me away guys so what,0.20429985
did you think of spider-man into the spider verse and have you even seen it,0.049809616
yet are you excited is that this is it bumblebee is an Aquaman later on,0.10113253
today you might just be getting a bumblebee movie review I believe that embargo is,0.016419394
going to drop while I'm watching the film I hope I can review it at,0.041625198
that point and then we have Aquaman and Mary Poppins later this month it's a,0.022890965
great month it's a great year for comic book movies and spider-man into the spider-verse,0.05111271
