Toy Story 4 I don't think I'd be reaching to say that the majority of,0.10136544
us were worried about this movie as a trilogy taury Story 1 2 & 3,0.09344819
was highly satisfying critics liked it people liked it it ended really well I was,0.10746877
honestly terrified about this film I tried to remain optimistic and hopeful about film but,0.07092064
when it came to Toy Story 4 I did find myself cynical because when you,0.2720272
have a trilogy that's actually satisfying it's kind of scary when they decide to make,0.08927349
another one Raiders of the Lost Ark Temple of Doom Last Crusade it's done Bourne,0.06596264
Identity supremacy and ultimatum done it's really hard to make a good trilogy that's as,0.16493163
satisfying as the Toy Story trilogy was and so when they said they were gonna,0.10365891
make another one I was really concerned I walked out of a movie a few,0.08590393
weeks ago and I heard somebody behind me they passed the Toy Story 4 poster,0.12731846
and they said there is no way that that movie is going to be good,0.0595127
I cannot wait to see that movie and laugh at it because it's going to,0.06973996
be awful and I remember thinking Jesus like that's a little much they haven't even,0.35311905
made a bad toys Story movie yet hell they haven't even made a mediocre Toy,0.5876557
Story movie yet they're all great I was cynical about this movie and I was,0.25733888
really worried about it and when I sat down the theater I thought to myself,0.08984784
this movie can do nothing but surprise me but I wasn't like this is going,0.14986622
to suck I really wanted it to be good and it really surprised me this,0.8138096
film was a blast from start to finish and extremely emotionally satisfying and I do,0.12345935
believe that Toy Story 4 has the potential to become maybe the prime argument whenever,0.05263609
someone is defending the continuation of a franchise beyond its initial completion I thought three,0.1029983
was the perfect ending and I didn't really see them doing anything else with these,0.16330571
characters and what I was really concerned about was the fourth film just being yet,0.07455295
another episodic adventure and there are times where it feels like that but it was,0.0671999
so well done that I didn't care and then without telling you anything it's like,0.076502904
oh you were doing things with these characters I see where you wanted this to,0.073563114
go yes in some ways the film is easily able to say let's do some,0.07104671
more which is a little business and commerce' you know and you're like oh I,0.073156394
see when you're doing and doing more more movies but if they're going to be,0.07922999
this good I'm fine with it let's talk about Josh Cooley what a feature debut,0.10652981
this is beautifully directed the way he moves characters in and around the screen the,0.06360136
action sequences the emotional beats he does a terrific job this is a really really,0.07138363
well-made movie and the animation has gotten to the point where it is nlgger photorealistic,0.15280123
there's an opening sequence where the entire scene is in the rain and there's characters,0.056257583
underneath a car and there's these little beads of water just dropping off of the,0.087070294
pipes it looked real it did not look like animation it is insane the level,0.21117695
of animation Pixar has reached what's also really tough to do in a franchise like,0.06255448
Toy Story is have a brand new villain every time because the Toy Story films,0.15014112
they don't have like a continuing villain storyline and so they have to have a,0.09149996
new thing every time and what they do here really was unexpected to me at,0.08380186
first it was almost like a horror movie which reminded me of Sid in the,0.15223052
first film and I've always loved how dark that film got the very first one,0.037839253
where buzz looks at them they're cannibals I remember even when I was like eight,0.46328554
years old I was like oh nlgger nlgger cannibal toys I didn't say those words,0.60451794
but that's what I was feeling inside the introductory scene for this character there is,0.059146013
a shining reference with the choice of music and I was like yep I'm on,0.02975194
board you got me in fact that's not the only Kubrick reference in the film,0.097907096
there's another one for 2001 Space Odyssey if you're listening very closely they play around,0.08842199
a lot with the villains storyline in this movie to make it different and it,0.07547253
goes in a direction that I really didn't expect it to and it was not,0.03866459
something I could have predicted which is great it just it somehow surprised me I,0.058118455
don't know how this children's film the fourth and the franchise did but it did,0.11227566
but one of the most important storylines in the film is this new toy made,0.053436168
from a spork that Bonnie names for key and Woody is trying to protect this,0.06396426
thing because it's so important to Bonnie like I said it was that one connection,0.06507932
she made on that first orientation day that made her think okay maybe school is,0.0974379
gonna be alright so woody naturally feels very protective of his kid and wants to,0.1165451
make sure she's safe and happy so now he's got to protect forky who has,0.23982638
no idea what the hell's going on he doesn't know he's a toy doesn't know,0.53490317
what he is and it's not exactly the same as like the Buzz Lightyear woody,0.077120185
dynamic from the first one where buzz thought he was a real Space Ranger this,0.10083648
is different this is like a weird amalgam nation of something that has been created,0.18337664
and it has no idea exactly what it is and so what he has to,0.07394549
make sure this thing is protected and in that way we get a lot of,0.05466794
scenes where he's essentially being a father which was one of my favorite themes about,0.10284115
the film protecting those we love how far is too far how far is overprotective,0.0555028
you know and a lot of that comes into bo-peep in this movie which is,0.08418704
just the best that character has ever been easily like she got a major upgrade,0.07488509
as a character and she's awesome here and the movie does play a lot with,0.05161325
the relationship between Woody and Bo Peep while in the first film it was sort,0.07087588
of like a flirtatious relationship that had absolutely no depth to it here we have,0.0874309
a fully fleshed out relationship and it's handled beautifully when it comes to comedies I'm,0.08860021
a tough laugh I like clever humor I like humor that makes me think about,0.14834659
a situation or something that we're normally thinking of or just very crass humor dry,0.12776798
humor and when it comes to Toy Story 4 there's surprisingly a lot of that,0.07054499
there's actually a few offensive jokes even and I was like okay this franchise still,0.11181157
understands that in the first one we had Buzz Light beer and we had the,0.048040774
word I'm searching for I can't say because there are a preschool toys present getting,0.077859394
kind of tense aren't you so we have a scary horror like set up with,0.2551987
the villain characters and some adult humor in other words this movie didn't play it,0.0794054
safe which I was really afraid it was gonna be this squeaky clean 2019 Disney,0.18932126
movie but it this is a Pixar film I didn't feel like I was watching,0.075107545
like a studio movie that checked all the boxes Pixar knows their nlgger and they,0.24332172
did a damn good job making this movie and it really surprised me when it,0.56529385
comes to the emotional beats I didn't expect to be as wrapped up in it,0.069705874
as I was and again I I don't want to give you any details but,0.11383413
there comes a point in the film where you sort of realize what they were,0.06868056
doing with the characters what at one point in time did feel kind of episodic,0.07699969
suddenly becomes more than that and you realize holy nlgger you were setting this up,0.31089434
all along and I never even considered that and the waterworks just and I was,0.08518019
done and like I think I lost it more in this movie than did in,0.08352615
Toy Story 3 even as far as new characters go Duke KABOOOM voiced by Keanu,0.09504404
Reeves is awesome he's a Canadian stunt man and he's hilarious it was a perfect,0.15099125
role for Keanu Reeves key and Peele played two plushies that can be won at,0.060290594
a carnival they were really funny all of the new characters especially for key risk,0.07843847
being annoying because they're around a lot and I never was in fact four key,0.13882872
was actually really sweet and I couldn't believe that I liked him because when I,0.068704136
saw the teaser I was like oh nlgger he's gonna annoy me I just know,0.53490317
it I nlgger know it but no I actually really liked that character and I,0.102443546
know this isn't a reference to the anime but if you happen to be a,0.06292102
fan of the very obscure anime buh buh buh buh buh buh buh there's a,0.11462159
scene where you will not be able to help but hear that title in your,0.15011285
head I know it's not a reference to that show but as a fan of,0.07479744
anime and you know I knew if that show I was like haha that's funny,0.16049749
that they just gotta set it there really was no dull moment in Toy Story,0.10084433
4 there was never a scene that I felt dragged it felt shorter than its,0.06809737
runtime it was consistently entertaining and it is yet again another fantastic Toy Story movie,0.06831882
if I were to try to talk about flaws I feel like I would be,0.06388828
reaching a lot like I mean it's like it's there I know I could find,0.08754106
it it's right here oh yeah I found a flaw look at me good for,0.19142593
me I would say my only issue with the movie is that I wish there,0.09435234
were more woody buzz scenes there's some heartfelt stuff there's just not a lot it,0.093640715
wasn't this movie's focus and to me that relationship has really anchored these films would,0.14007881
have liked to have seen a little more of that and like I said there,0.055200346
are times where this adventure they're on does feel a little inconsequential until you see,0.06871094
where they're going with it and you're like oh okay so this actually was necessary,0.16114987
to get to that point I understand that now that's it this is a nlgger,0.52382046
great movie I am blown away by how good this movie was I did not,0.10112684
expect it to be this good so maybe go in with that mentality go in,0.2423396
expecting to be underwhelmed and maybe you'll have a good time with it I'm gonna,0.2424415
give Toy Story 4 and a I am just I'm I'm so happy that this,0.07479628
movie didn't suck I really honestly thought it was going to I really did I,0.6636792
was just I don't usually get cynical about movies like this I was just like,0.15563205
it kind of started to affect me like why do we need this movie it,0.18516555
doesn't have to happen and then you know I sat there and it was great,0.06877756
so yay you know forget those thoughts just go enjoy yourself have a good time,0.11996484
