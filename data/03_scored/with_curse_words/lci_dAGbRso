alright so I just got back from seeing this movie for a second time and,0.071705185
I just oh my god just want to sit down and just spew out my,0.24007043
thoughts and just one stream of consciousness because seriously this movie is nlgger special ok,0.2840067
I mean let's just jump right into the the plot twist at the end of,0.14333259
the film the the main revelation and the third act where we find out that,0.05737488
all these memories between Amy Adams and this little girl who eventually seems to die,0.31000024
over cancer or something like that we see these like heart heart achingly beautiful memories,0.21803635
between the two of them that are just so vivid and seriously at the in,0.08149275
the third act when Amy Adams she walks outside the giant alien ship hovering hovering,0.18735437
in the sky it sends out like a small single person pod you know Amy,0.10907139
Adams she gets in it to get sent back up to the mothership now I,0.12352897
know where brilliantly she's like covered in his gas was which I guess the gas,0.25263554
that surrounds her not only makes her levitate but uh makes her kind of be,0.21113588
calm kind of a drug induced in front of the aliens you know the calm,0.44704065
her down so that when she's like she's like standing on the clouds talking to,0.20392504
one of the aliens um but you know she doesn't freak out or anything but,0.17014372
anyways when she and this giant alien or talking and essentially they've given her given,0.22511241
her the gift of being able to see into the future and then we realized,0.07015086
that this whole time okay well I saw this movie for the first time I,0.087720096
was like oh man you know it sucks that you know she had this daughter,0.794439
and she she died and throughout the movie she keeps remembering her dead daughter that's,0.4059149
nlgger up but but like I realize that all those moments between her and her,0.4031897
daughter took place in the future they hadn't even happened yet I mean what the,0.17992254
nlgger watching the movie a second time was almost it was almost like watching the,0.37698257
movie again for the first time because I mean I had a completely different viewpoint,0.08948327
of these memories between mother and daughter oh my god I did not see that,0.097748324
nlgger coming I mean it it just totally mind nlgger me in what's interesting is,0.56784785
that she seems to imply at the end before she kisses jeremy renner and the,0.0627992
present day that like she had a flash-forward of her whole life you know cuz,0.17468002
you know there's one flash forward where you know she's written that book about the,0.05629569
the alien languages and she's at that party and that um that the chinese guy,0.16044569
i'm not sure if he was a the Chinese President or what or what but,0.17555968
this guy he you know he's talking to her about the phone call that she,0.12893952
made it is so weird oh my god ok the moment we're in the present,0.12666452
day when Amy Adams she grabs a phone and she's running through the tents and,0.15086056
she calls this guy like oh my god it's so weird because her future self,0.42842212
did not I don't know how to explain this it's almost as if like her,0.18880697
past it's almost like the future is out there happening as we speak it's already,0.05951803
preordained right and her past self is like affecting um the future self in real,0.15815414
time like if the like give her future self and events were a live stream,0.11310438
it's almost as if like her past self is you know affecting that live stream,0.25917655
as is happening in real time I don't know this is making sense but holy,0.094653174
nlgger that just blows my mind cuz her future self when that Chinese President or,0.67051303
military guy whoever this guy when he was like oh you told me my wife's,0.17331143
last dying words you told that to me over the phone it was crazy like,0.4032037
her future self didn't even immediately know what was happening her past self which was,0.15553018
just updating her in the present day oh my god I don't know someone's gonna,0.13095295
be able to decipher what I'm saying but it's what the nlgger just the way,0.55308586
that the film deals with time paradoxes from being able to see into the future,0.036292374
like that oh my god and then and there's still some things I don't fully,0.094568
understand like why the hell did they place the the bombs inside the ships you,0.65701365
know during this part where it explodes and and jeremy renner and Amy Adams or,0.07450782
levitated to safety which oh my god that blew my mind and I just always,0.33646372
brilliant that aliens landed all over the world because it made so because I give,0.17886552
one ship only a ride to earth and landed in America you know may have,0.12700783
been possible that the Americans could have hid that ship for a long time so,0.13402405
having multiple ships land around the world makes it so that you know everyone is,0.097693145
aware you know there's nothing to hide and you know everyone is aware that they're,0.060144432
here I'm saying so it forces the world to talk together to communicate together to,0.08119979
work together if aliens if aliens really do show up that would be a great,0.24469726
way to make us work together you know Sam because they're everywhere but not just,0.084448025
in one central location and what's crazy is that you know there's like this is,0.20386499
implied in the film but like you know like through computer monitors and stuff but,0.039962653
like in the world people are writing religious people are going insane there's like protests,0.5116969
people robbing each other's people talking nlgger about the military and the president people are,0.5227803
going crazy and aliens haven't even done anything they haven't they have not revealed themselves,0.47702858
the public they arrived in spaceships that don't make any sound that aren't damaging anything,0.12747882
there's no clear signs of weapons on the outside of the ships you know saying,0.09859414
like it's it kind of blows your mind because I feel like in real life,0.40330422
our reaction to these exact same alien ships would be very similar but sad because,0.1486482
it means like what better way is it for aliens to come in peace I,0.15525362
mean my god they're in an egg-shaped ship it's not like there's guns on the,0.34613463
outside like I mean they I don't know that aliens could could arrive in a,0.1503807
more peaceful way honestly you know I just thought that was so sad that humans,0.17867137
are acting so hateful yet they came they arrived in the most peaceful way plausible,0.40310183
you know I mean and holy nlgger man that plot twist just blew my mind,0.45970604
at the end just the montage of future events mesh with the present day events,0.036241215
gave me goosebumps seriously when you see Amy Adams future daughter kind of like she,0.24142112
was skipping the way through the scene here like I almost felt a tear come,0.09072474
to my eyes because you realize that she is perceiving herself having a child of,0.2907254
the future her husband being Jeremy Renner but then also she sees the whole of,0.084866896
her life name sees our daughter dying from cancer like oh my what but um,0.41139075
I thought that the soundtrack was extraordinary extraordinary soundtrack this this composer crafted it he's,0.0805641
one my favorite composers of all time he created this album right here this album,0.15657759
literally changed my life but i'll have to get i'll have to speak to that,0.06250903
at some other time i think all the performances are great even forest whitaker's Bazaarvoice,0.1048274
which I just personally found to be fascinating I don't know what accent to what,0.10779786
was going on with for for this blue with forest whitaker's voice but it was,0.11036945
fascinating nonetheless I thought that Amy Adams and general in her head great chemistry but,0.11819961
Amy Adams carries is this film so well this probably her best performance that I,0.059298128
think I've ever seen from her seriously like and there's one sequence where she was,0.095171586
like riding on a big-ass dry erase board and there's a question on there which,0.69542736
was like what is your purpose on earth or something like that Forest Whitaker was,0.13000512
like we'll just go up there and and and ask the aliens that question what's,0.07380049
the issue and she's like well first off we need to understand we need to,0.08792836
find out we need to find out if they even know what the nlgger a,0.4033329
question is and we need to make sure that they know the difference between you,0.0807864
and your we need to find out if they even know what the word what,0.09099134
means and then we need that you know saying like it was just I don't,0.07988164
know I've never looked at it that way like if we make first contact with,0.06254389
alien so we need a community communicate with them I never looked at it in,0.14632842
such a I never looked at it like that I mean it would be that,0.0811166
complicated for real like we gotta be careful you know them like I love this,0.083472334
brilliant moment between jeremy renner and amy adams and the helicopter which is the lighting,0.04417209
the lighting in this film the cinematography is so perfect it feels so natural like,0.103998326
every scene seems to be naturally lit but anyways this moment between them on the,0.11390795
helicopter where Jeremy Renner he's just like oh well you know let's ask him you,0.15031996
know why are why are they here what do they want from us how did,0.060126577
they get here how long did take for them to get here and he's just,0.10588052
like listing off all these questions and Amy Adams is just like why don't we,0.093113124
just start with you know why would just talk to them before throwing equations at,0.10428846
them which I thought was great and just like her act her acting in that,0.118777186
scene right there like her look of disapproval when he was bringing up that list,0.07701235
of questions and then the smug look on her face you know the small grin,0.50161767
on her face after she kind of just told him off you know she gives,0.46507537
a very nuanced performance and it's is so convincing it is so convincing every time,0.06751271
she is perceiving future events and she seems to be in pain and then confusion,0.16000769
or hell even on this scene when she first sees you know the first hippo,0.4771657
pod or whatever they call those alien ships the look of like what is that,0.1759336
and then like the look of being startled and I mean she was just great,0.1630899
she was just great um again all of the cast was sufficient but Amy Adams,0.11118531
was what's the best out of the bunch I am blown away by this movie,0.118778184
I mean the first the first time I think it's brilliant that we did not,0.077658385
see the ships until she saw the ships like that made the am the alien,0.15025164
spaceship sound seemed very ominous in an eerie you know when she's when she goes,0.13250867
to class Amy Adams and they're all watching the ships on TV except for us,0.105049595
the viewer were not we're not seeing it we're just saying their expressions of astonishment,0.10546693
from what they're saying but we don't see what they see that nlgger was so,0.24602403
eerie have my imagination racing I was just like damn well they look were they,0.30371112
looking at what did what what are they saying like what the nlgger you know,0.5430252
and this shot right here honestly might become iconic one day this the CGI in,0.2655228
this film is impeccable it is my frontrunner to win Best Visual Effects at the,0.08773159
oscars there was never a time that the CGI was unconvincing the CGI was always,0.0780589
nlgger convincing I mean even on scenes were like like here where were there floating,0.46550956
into the and to the hallways like the the CGI was perfect it looked perfect,0.08016022
even when you know these two got blown back the way the lighting was the,0.14993507
way that the shadows fell on them looks so convincing holy nlgger I am blown,0.36163753
away by this movie impeccable CGI um really really immersive powerful sound design sound effects,0.12577267
and musical score the plot twist just like literally rattle my brain is very is,0.15196848
so interesting that the aliens the aliens refer to time as a weapon you know,0.3022574
the the gift of foresight that they give Amy Adams you know they consider that,0.03995702
a weapon or at least they called it that like why use the why would,0.15541653
you use the word weapon that's so weird to me oh man oh man what,0.24100421
would have happened if if you know all the nations banded together and because you,0.10642742
know when them before the explosion that the aliens has sent out a bunch of,0.15300743
symbols which formed this like weird mass of data and the computers that they took,0.10006045
that same mass of data and combine it with all the other Pods data I'm,0.07002595
not sure what would have happened but I don't know I'm trying to focus on,0.08136719
some questions that I still have about the film I know that on this scene,0.085322805
right here before Amy Adams gets in the car with Jeremy Renner she says something,0.09635384
to him but I don't remember what she said or when the Chinese President or,0.18020223
the Chinese military guy whoever this guy the last thing that his wife said to,0.16238414
him it wasn't translated like what does she say like I still have a few,0.10958367
questions maybe I'll add some more of them down below in the comments section so,0.15080863
no we're we're kind of the 15-minute mark but honestly I was blown the nlgger,0.38425678
away by this film like goosebumps inducing the smartest most emotionally powerful alien film that,0.2843305
I've that I think I've ever seen in terms of like a first contact alien,0.082702726
film for sure uh I think my favorite film of this kind has been Jodie,0.1911253
Foster's contact for the longest time but yeah this is my new favorite this is,0.02939799
like my new favorite alien film like where we first communicate with aliens like this,0.18244213
is my new favorite a holy nlgger yeah I'm feeling it tonight n it's a,0.2249831
masterpiece and I think in the future we will look back and realize that this,0.05557283
was one the smartest films about aliens ever created uh yeah I think I think,0.13917494
that's all I got I think I'm gonna dip out of here so I got,0.15110244
some other videos to make but I just I just had to give this to,0.06706718
you just an in one straight shot because I just I just needed to gush,0.49056816
about this film cuz honestly it just blew my mind it was even better the,0.23965652
second time god damn as I have lingering questions and things that uh certain things,0.79897
I want to rewatch like that one scene with Amy Adams and Jerry Jeremy Renner,0.15332447
on that truck the cinematography was perfect the way that the ship looked in the,0.07897893
background was perfect it looked like it was actually there this moment where Amy Adams,0.058302496
was walking through the field in the way that the Sun is hitting her in,0.16904989
the way that the ship is eerily in the background I mean it looks so,0.11684701
beautiful the ship the ship looks so real out there holy nlgger this movie just,0.16844735
