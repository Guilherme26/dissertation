so hi and welcome to the channel to the first part of what i'm mostly calling my first season of my french cinema season plan is to take one film roughly from each decade from the 1930s up and talk about it in terms of theme in terms of plot in terms of ideas,0.03755912
and imports relevance to the events of the world that were going around long around that time and what was happening around cinema,0.035361093
and why this film is worth talking about or worth watching and a mixture of these films will be either films that have seen either once or more times beforehand or a film that i watched that seemed to fit or be different enough around that time to talk about,0.11923155
and if i'm gonna start in the 1930s there's really no other place to start off than well one of the most important i would say films of all time or one that many people will revere for numerous reasons and we'll discuss reasons why that may be you may be familiar with it you may not you may have heard about it,0.068823785
you might not have,0.15575793
but it is the film that has got infamy,0.26059768
certainly in boutique blu-ray collecting circles as being spine number one in the criterion collection that is jean-ren mars or grand illusion the grown religion is a 1936 film which stars jean-gaban as a co-pilot or a helper for a pilot who was shot down in an enemy territory and captured by the germans,0.24256971
now this is all set in world war one and while the film is a war film it is a war film of taste,0.1084471
or it is not a bombastic war film that many were filmed you've seen before,0.065328464
because there's hardly a bullet fired there's hardly a shout of anger,0.31089434
this is a film about the nicer side of war or what happens behind the scenes in war it talks about the relationships between the people that are both together and their captors,0.10785387
and what john menmore was thinking about that jungkook is a mechanic to the more celebrated captain blonde,0.13779318
they are thrust together into the same captivity,0.1078817
and what you have is a film that explores like i say relationships between different nationalities but also relationships around aristocracy and working class and really this is what the film is about regardless of experiences of war because on one level,0.09900809
we have captain blunder the captured french officer who's from the aristocracy and then you have erik vance throughheims character van rothenstein who is the german aristocrat who's his captor and one of the ideas that renoir had and that he has said about subsequently is that our circumstances are the things that bind us together,0.11179639
he often says rather than the frenchness of each other being the people our nationality that binds us together that is our experiences,0.09552166
so he uses the experience or the example of a chinese farmer,0.23997642
in a french farmer meeting as long as they could get over the language buyer,0.17253216
they would have lots to speak about whereas the aristocracy,0.062053982
and the working class have left to speak around well once they get the their common bond of being french out of the way,0.10851819
so these are these are the themes that are explored within and sure enough when rothenstein and captain blunder bond over their common upbringing,0.24281943
there is a camaraderie around people of same class even in war situations and they will dine together just like the working class can dine together,0.1530896
but one of the other nice things that comes into this is that the aristocracy in the work class,0.06125998
they see that these things are changing in the modern world,0.05247317
so things like wealth are going to break down,0.117835976
these class buyers if you have enough wealth it can subjugate or tear apart these boundaries an example being one of the captors is a jewish banker,0.37384644
he comes from a family of juice bankers and they have wealth,0.06164031
and while there,0.031364486
he's in captivity together with the other people that are supposedly of working class they can eat quite well because his family sent him food packages into captivity and they eat lavishly just like the aristocracy and while blunder and von rafenstein think about you know how this,0.06680846
they're the last bastions of that generation it is born out with what you have here,0.11318379
and while there are other things and there are other parts of this film brought to the fore,0.049699247
it is these that stick in the mind the idea that those in captivity are trying to escape is one that runs throughout the film as they're thwarted by both circumstance or by otherwise and you get this really wonderful taste of even at the end of high barriers and neat people's needs,0.051201303
circumvent that the underlying themes are the underlying beliefs that are there i do intend to talk about some of the relationships between the director and what they they made though because jean renoir was somebody that fought in the first world war he had an injury that he sustained,0.07477391
and he this is sort of loosely autobiographical about many of the experiences that he thought he had or experienced around that time and what was supposedly a gentleman's world world war one and on the back of her in the face of world war two coming across which was a very militant war which was much more about technology which was much more about hatred this contrasts with what world war one was now on the side of this you have what actually happened the film itself and this is,0.13679592
i think one of the lovely bits of story that actually where art mimics life,0.10994521
because this film was used insane as bit of a a bit of a populist piece around war and what war should be,0.4233017
and what it shouldn't be so much,0.10152418
so that when the nazis seen it they confiscated it they got rid of the film they did not want it seen when roosevelt seen it in america for his i'm sure as a part of the birthday party for his wife he fell in love with the film he wanted it widely seen,0.24253355
he thought this was the very embodiment of what a modern society should be so while he was praising it the nazis were looking rid of it,0.40324083
this kind of idea of populist or using the film as a way to tell a message or to spread the good word was at very much,0.104546756
at the far ends of the spectrum in fact lagrand illusion was confiscated so much that people thought it was lost,0.08465407
the time turns out that it was in the russian health part of berlin,0.09126381
and they decided to take it away with them for many years and put it in the moscow film foundation,0.09369058
and it was only returned to france around 1960 toulouse uh for restoration and for looking at and as a a piece of of grand cinema other prints that were used at the time there was one put out in 1948 there were there were pieced together from other surviving elements,0.060145557
but the original fulfillment was only really brought back in that stage,0.05720643
and then later they were re-scanned and cleaned up and and the film that we see today bores bears fruit from that it has a stunningly beautiful picture even by modern standards in the form that we have it the release that i had which was the studio canal version has lots of really considered extras,0.08188248
both about the journey of the film how it passed from nation to nation and how those nations had to work together for a common goal of restoring this film and the fact that nobody actually did even though it was heated by the nazis,0.23072185
they didn't actually destroy it,0.15061629
they held on to it and stored it away,0.16197386
so it wouldn't be seen,0.09135752
and as many parts of of nazi life,0.5475831
they appreciated art,0.088303275
and there was a appreciation of how powerful art could be in so far as you know girls had lenny reefing style make propaganda films so so this is this is the film that we see today,0.060170896
and one that i desperately think everybody should check out in some way should perform thanks for watching,0.10404264
and i'll catch,0.07521454
you next time when we go to the 1940s and as well as a surprise and for let you prepare i'll tell you what film that i'm going to do i'm going to talk about panic by jules de vivre a story about another jewish person in the face of war i'll catch,0.51490253
you then speak to them take care,0.12140062
bye,0.05204066
you,0.10154687
