hello everybody welcome back to another movie reaction today we got another special one now,0.06813161
this has been on the patreon poll for quite some time and it's always just,0.05028834
barely missing it to being watched on the top two now this film is ladybird,0.1484821
now this is something that i'm i'm really i'm really just like looking forward to,0.0558623
because i've heard a lot of great things about it uh just in the regards,0.066527046
of just the the story itself and the writing and i i'm just like excited,0.06251746
as well as it being directed written and i'm trying to think of the other,0.097708
credit but it's produced by a probably like a woman as well too and you,0.16100982
guys know how i feel about just people being misrepresented or just underrepresented in film,0.13278052
uh in the film medium and i strive my best to shine a light on,0.02601686
to those who are just not as highlighted usually in the film industry which is,0.04795388
you know women and people of color and just other variations as well too just,0.3687644
to list a few examples so it's really great when you have bodies of work,0.13128616
whether good or bad just being made by people within that realm because it gives,0.18599929
forth a whole new perspective an opportunity of storytelling and just different perspectives which i,0.03629549
think is the key reasoning to making a film especially presenting it to an audience,0.07728155
so i'm really excited to kind of look at this not only through fresh eyes,0.14872146
me first first time watching this but also looking at it from a filmmaking perspective,0.08413562
and also really acknowledging and you know getting an insight of why this film is,0.08274702
great and what makes this film great and kind of like what i take out,0.114928804
of this film and you know hopefully learn something new myself uh so i'm really,0.11465477
excited about just the opportunity to learn and to educate and potentially help educate you,0.121270075
guys as well too i'm really excited about that so guys like always if you,0.107426174
want to see the full length because i do chop these up and a good,0.44233438
bit is you know unfortunately taking out of the youtube edit definitely check out the,0.25844705
full length below doing the you know through the patreon link if that's something that,0.10421499
you're interested in but like always guys i'm going to stop talking let's get right,0.35937408
into lady bird hey let's just sit with what we heard dang that dynamic shift,0.3736814
is wow oh so now you're mad no it's because i'm ridiculous because you have,0.7093121
a great moment i'm sorry i'm not perfect no one's asking you to be perfect,0.1115021
just consider it would do i don't even want to go to school i love,0.12724046
this already because i immediately noticed the dynamic shift barely be able to afford in-state,0.094851375
tuition mother daughter mother-son relationship can kind of be like that you guys can be,0.24177104
so emotionally attached and then be yelling at each other it all comes from a,0.15277645
good place though my name is ladybird uh well actually it's not and it's ridiculous,0.5876557
call me ladybird like you said you you should just go to city college you,0.53490317
know with your work ethic just wow i love how the conversation like their dialogue,0.07752337
is almost like overlapping one another i was i was not expecting that wow i,0.10354255
don't think i've ever done that afraid that we will not get into the college,0.08861657
of our choice we're afraid we won't be loved we won't be liked we won't,0.07480841
succeed there are the classics i'm really interested in seeing how this film tackles the,0.076971404
cliches of you know the life growing into the life sort of stories that we're,0.13620359
kind of used to i mean like you know amazed and confused being an example,0.09970204
of one i'm really interested in seeing how this film tells that story differently especially,0.04572223
being in a different time era having a different protagonist with a different mindset different,0.0488673
life it leaves for a lot of creativity in those areas do you know if,0.118457995
sarah lawrence is actually in the city your parents would pay for that scholarships financial,0.15287025
aid i'll figure it out my mom thinks i can't get in but she is,0.17930432
sorely mistaken she already got a little bit about like her dream of going to,0.13964894
like new york and you know i guess you could say places of like civilization,0.10412622
i guess you could say where people feel as though their dreams are i guess,0.09629352
they can't have pencils anymore there and they feel like they have to leave when,0.08104006
in reality i mean it might have always been there i don't know i can,0.09246093
relate to that because you know my experiences with even going to california myself maybe,0.03516602
that could be saved for a video in itself a q a you guys let,0.066310704
me know send them a note do you think that shelley and miguel have sex,0.710725
on the pullout couch oh yeah oh man that's great make your own eggs i,0.49516526
wanted to you don't let me your sister doesn't like me i'm hungry that was,0.6046674
great that entire scene was great for so many reasons i absolutely love that i,0.13003752
believe it you guys know how much i love dinner scenes or just anything at,0.10457022
the table there's so much personality that can be brought towards that and they did,0.05660093
a phenomenal job just with that is that your given name yeah why is it,0.089571655
in quote well i gave it to myself it's given to me by me okay,0.13260677
i love the energy that is some great energy right there this is awesome i,0.039785754

kinds of energy but she she's feeling them she's feeling him listen stop hey hi,0.16156706
come here often excuse me i'm ladybug yo this is great i love the interactions,0.4830798
here because i yeah i get our emotions going we're going to play i absolutely,0.070298806
love how this film looks by the way it doesn't feel like a nostalgia because,0.09670116
i don't think this was filmed in in film you know if i could use,0.08558516
a correlation like dazed and confused feels nostalgic because it's film you know like it,0.107908726
has that natural grain i think this feels like an emotion this feels like a,0.08339463
dream because it's shot digitally but the greens and the blue hues of the shadows,0.140637
really give forth these incredible emotions it feels like a moment find the problems where,0.067929566
you went wrong and work them out good job jules i could tell from your,0.18440129
work you even understood the ones you missed yikes yikes you know when a teacher,0.11748343
gives you a test face down that's never a good sign oh boy oh boy,0.31756654
i still don't know how to use those rollers that you gave me oh oh,0.31480607
man oh man the awkwardness is is so authentic ah there you go yo oh,0.15109403
man i i oh this is great again like that's why i don't feel nostalgic,0.1506033
over it it feels like a memory because i mean shoot i felt that way,0.4505907
when i had my first kiss some of your friends fathers could employ your father,0.2591282
and they're not going to do it if it looks like his family is trash,0.79858
wow wow dang it's so interesting how this story almost feels like it's being told,0.14674382
by two different perspectives you know like you get little inputs of her story and,0.06884156
then almost like the reality of the family specifically the mothers they pick up your,0.106174745
feet i didn't know if you were talking about being passive aggressive you are so,0.3514427
infuriated i'm not yelling oh it's perfect i love it oh man i love the,0.10740846
writing in this i mean it really does showcase the duality of it like especially,0.061339177
the mother and daughter relationship you know like again it's just all out of love,0.13099563
even if it's weird in the duffel bag don't worry about it geez my grandmother,0.31510144
will love that dress i think i think what i'm noticing too about the mother,0.12561676
hence why she's so strict this is because yeah oh my god it's because she's,0.17258893
me letting her daughter go you know like she's slowly coming to terms with that,0.31089434
and i think that's her own way of coping with it i just hope it,0.14674427
doesn't self-destruct her daughter you know and we have to kill his older brothers too,0.79628855
oh boy oh boy that's oh no it's him it's the man it's dune guy,0.2532355
let me stop playing there's never a line in the men's room oh oh okay,0.22383158
all right all right wow i was not i was not expecting that now i'm,0.06711975
pretty sure dune guy now is going to be uh an open option do you,0.1497073

summer jobs covered it this is why we have computer shut-off time this is our,0.14823627

not paying you to flirt i wasn't flirting she had been this dude is too,0.44036868
he is too cool man i was never that cool i mean i kept to,0.15930907
myself when i was younger but like i don't know i looked like something else,0.13158186
i think i think i think the universe above for this glow up now cause,0.082068674
oh man all right let's have everyone take a knee huh what cozy sit now,0.20987663
i know you all miss father devayed i can tell you that the brothers oh,0.09720205

number to each of your roles and i'm gonna put the blocking up here on,0.31089434
the board and then if you guys can transcribe that back into your playbooks that'd,0.1533111
be great oh this is great that's a beautiful flip on like the cliche of,0.17739742
the gym coach always teaching jim oh this is great this is comedy i love,0.058257975

of time to figure out how i'm going to tell my mom and dad don't,0.12538622
worry hmm wow wow that's wow i'm wow that's really that's that was really well,0.073088914
done man wow i absolutely love that that was really well done that was good,0.11019544
anything and everything he's like sasuke holy crap he's like never industrially produced is he,0.84100974
sasuke guy now oh my goodness [Laughter] you live in sacramento i love it here,0.2424651
i want to send my daughters to immaculate heart i also love that like the,0.16542058
people that she's meeting like they're not like cliche evil you know like in other,0.3606057
movies this girl right here would be like completely evil you know i think she's,0.5876557
just like plus three times like it feels like it's just another friendship that was,0.0748987
kind of made and whether if it's good or bad it is but she isn't,0.14571261
inherently evil yeah well you know your mom's tits they're fake totally fake she made,0.9489616
one bad decision at 19. two bad decisions and at 15 wow she actually made,0.1464361
an interesting point about just like lady bird always kind of like wanting attention as,0.106244236
well too cause low-key she always does want attention me a number for how much,0.16580343
it costs to raise me and i'm gonna get older and make a lot of,0.09800986
money and write you a check for what i owe you so that i never,0.24104463
have to speak to you again wow oh wow jeez man that was that was,0.18295433
rough i'm just happy i didn't lose my virginity to you yeah i was about,0.77873725
to say i was about to say i don't yeah he never he never said,0.115163185
that i was on top who the is on top their first time you mean,0.085719556
like awareness of how many civilians we've killed since the invasion in iraq started what's,0.36646616
this sweater oh man that moment is just uh man shout out to the moms,0.24234942
out there my goodness what a what a role again i gotta shout out how,0.14959082
much i love the compositioning of this camera and most importantly the color grading of,0.085933715
this film i think it's it's it's perfect for this i i absolutely love it,0.11704803
i feel like it's the perfect color grade for this film because of just how,0.10112407
it's capturing the moments in our life sure i guess i pay attention don't you,0.09394764
think maybe they are the same thing love and attention yes and that's what i,0.05585132
was talking about like that's what i was feeling like what was like almost like,0.097747095
the theme of this movie is like this is our last one when people you,0.14231312
know pay attention to her when she pays attention to things it's like it's like,0.091096774
love and i think that's why the mother and daughter relationship is just so like,0.0702205
that is like the perfection of love because it's not perfect but there's a tension,0.09818376
involved and i think that creates perseverance you know like love isn't like perfect or,0.09622505
anything but it perseveres too tight and i and i think that's the theme of,0.116203435
the mother and daughter's relationship i'm so happy she said that i think she's weird,0.47597036
she is weird hey guys i guess i'll just sit shotgun man really did just,0.5425776
like wait in the car though that's that's uh come on now that's too sasuke,0.23640265
for me hate this song i love it thank you thank you please it's so,0.42571628
interesting because other than like there'd be moments where she would stick by herself and,0.15468168
then she would not can you take me to my friend julie's house please and,0.116494946
i'm just so happy she's embracing it now um oh man this this is great,0.22228198
this is a really damn good film this is a really damn good film i,0.48239365
feel like with dazed and confused it captured an era this film captures a moment,0.065698214
and freeze all faults as you from crimes would pardon to be let your indulgence,0.43497252
set me free you yo that is the man i uh i love his character,0.08708919
it's so good man it is so good sorry i know i can lie and,0.15204822
not be a good person but please mom please i'm so sorry i didn't mean,0.26935092
to i'm noticing how she's not giving her any attention all those memories man it,0.17277412
really does feel like i've i've just entered her life it's so good and it's,0.31089434
just so beautifully executed man seriously the power of film making well done dang you,0.45244947
gotta learn how to let go like i said it's so self-destructive if you become,0.45666254
like that i can't imagine how rough it must be but like you gotta be,0.24197608
able to see your daughter off to college at least you know like come on,0.3093295
turn around turn around turn around you're almost there come on it's okay should be,0.2684217
back man geez i'm happy she came back though i really am that was a,0.14824738
well done shot hey mom did you feel emotional the first time that you drove,0.5784402
in sacramento um oh man i'm getting chills i'm getting a whole lot of chills,0.11509779
right here right in the heart yep you you start really paying attention to things,0.08530048
when you leave it and then when you come back and the whole theme of,0.091012016
paying attention and loving and how those relate with one another i love you it's,0.044939894
beautifully told and that is ladybird wow that was a phenomenal film guys all right,0.111585274
everybody and we just got done watching ladybird man oh man this film was just,0.1513242
yeah this is a great one this is this is definitely a good one this,0.04425498
was it's so interesting watching all of these films that pertain to you know nostalgia,0.16391648
and you know referring back to an era or a dream a moment and just,0.048553977
watching how the stories that are being told are showcased through the filmmaking and man,0.06296778
like lady bird did just a phenomenal job telling a story about a moment and,0.09517508
a girl's life and just her womanhood as she grew more into herself and it,0.44375622
did it in such a way that wasn't it took all the cliches and it,0.10268763
it it it almost authenticated it i don't even know if that's even a word,0.11624135
but that's what i'm feeling it feels like they just basically got all these cliches,0.22804876
and they were like this is how we make them real to this person so,0.1752601
they can be relatable to you know to those who experience this and i feel,0.08720873
like this is one of those films where you know it could easily be a,0.15177579
hit or miss because of just how personal it can be and i mean that,0.31089434
with all praise because it definitely hit with me because i know even though i,0.11149529
am a guy i feel as though the experiences that she went through with christine,0.10264503
lady bird went through um you know the themes of it are very real to,0.10333703
my childhood and my evolution as who i am now and what i'm probably going,0.09215147
to be in the future and i can relate very heavily to those themes because,0.045701325
the theme is love the theme is growth and you know growing through these uncertainties,0.080724575
and realizing that not everything is as pictured perfect and as hollywood as the stories,0.088541605
would like you to think that they are but in fact they are more textured,0.2528392
and more unknown and i love that ladybird explored those those moments and i i'm,0.14785364
just so happy that it was you know created by a woman you know like,0.21296243
this by all the terms was yeah it's it's just it's just great because i,0.08088444
love seeing stories of different types and it just makes me happy seeing more opportunities,0.055619594
in film that are told by people who usually don't get that opportunity and i,0.088154435
think this is just one of the many reasons that are out there in terms,0.06875291
of why it is important no matter where you are or whatever you're going through,0.16766834
to tell your story no matter what the case may be you know it's it's,0.08631308
a beautiful thing and you could really be helping other people doing it so i,0.12336442
just want to say thank you to the director and to all the people who,0.08452053
laid hands on this film and for those patreon people who recommended me this um,0.29491213
