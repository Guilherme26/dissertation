directed by Jordan Peele most notably known for Key & Peele the skit comedy show,0.027927736
on Comedy Central and the basic premise is that Rose wants to invite Chris to,0.005727231
meet her family in the woods and he is just concerned that they might not,0.047115624
know that they aren't of the same color she tells them don't worry he goes,0.097378895
along with it and horror movie comedy ensues I have to say that this is,0.03343479
my favorite movie of 2017 I have seen tons of reviews of the movie I,0.019769924

said about this movie it is brilliant first of all Jordan Peele are you kidding,0.023542179
me is this the first time you're writing and directing a movie a plus incredible,0.034609504
not only is it filmed properly the pacing is right there is symbolism everywhere I,0.031127933
actually had to read an article after watching the movie about little symbols and hints,0.036222577
that you may have missed within the movie and there's so much going on you,0.039251156
don't catch everything there's a lot I did catch but a lot I didn't and,0.020963928
that was what was surprising it's really thought out and it is a funny movie,0.022009596
it is the kind of scary movie that you watch with friends with tons of,0.04971782
people and all audiences I do not think this is a movie for any audience,0.051069476
in particular there is a dynamic there especially specifically black Americans and white Americans that,0.11700714
is addressed under layers of comedy and horror thriller there are some scenes that aren't,0.019327575
even part of a war movie they're just like real-life like the garden party scene,0.1402134
at the Armitage his house where Chris is scrutinized and asked the most uncomfortable questions,0.033312395
that's a reality for a lot of people in America and it's sad that some,0.051038876
people don't know that and that's what I really appreciated is that this movie started,0.032362513
a lot of necessary discussions around the world when I watch this movie with friends,0.0474848
some people didn't really like the way Daniel kahl√∫a played Chris they thought he was,0.0178216
a bit too muted in his acting and I kind of agreed but at the,0.07030592
same time I don't because we're so used to seeing big acting in war movies,0.08103999
and if you really look back especially the second time I watch this movie around,0.094127476
there are subtleties in Daniels acting that really harm masterfully done just wow you see,0.05553485
a multitude of emotions crosses face in moments there's so much doubt and he's in,0.049993873
a situation that makes a lot of people when you are the minority in a,0.028426623
situation like this you feel uncomfortable you feel paranoid you feel crazy it kind of,0.16995642
reminded me of my experience at a resort in Cuba and the people around you,0.027739488
make you feel like no you're seeing things that aren't there which is kind of,0.033604413
what Daniel goes through with Rose I think your family's kind of racist the way,0.31965694
they interact with me and Rose is just like I think you're reading way too,0.024291841
much into it Alison as Rose did also a fantastic job really well done and,0.027166765
it's hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it but I'm trying I'm gonna,0.10112388
try not to say anything spoilery until I really get to the spoilers I didn't,0.020807609
see the story going the way it did it really did take me by surprise,0.034174476
it's very well written Betty Gabriel as Georgina gave me chills okay there are moments,0.039795276
in her acting subtle but powerful and after you've seen the movie once I urge,0.039597716
people to see it again because you will see layers upon layers of acting there,0.04056689
and you'll just be like oh my goodness girl Wow I'm talking James McAvoy split-level,0.05249297
acting here anyone acting for me Marcus Henderson as Walter - the gardener did a,0.035165597
good job he really did my brain is going all over the place with this,0.08312334
movie there are scenes in the film that seem random and that seem like typical,0.017326038
horror movie moments for example there's a scene where Walters just like sprinting at night,0.08928893
and there's that scene in the trailer where Chris talks to Georgina and the meltdown,0.061411083
and the episode that happens up on Georgina's face is everything and you understand at,0.08312068
the end everything comes together so cleverly but I started coming actually and when we,0.024532638
get to the end when we get to the reveal when we figure out what's,0.02988404
going on personally everything kind of started to click in my head oh I think,0.18951282
I know where this is going ok but still even when you think you know,0.041935172
what's going it doesn't go where you think it'll go it keeps surprising you at,0.035559386
every turn and that's what I really appreciated the end is just phenomenal phenomenal ending,0.045730047
for a movie not just a horror movie just any movie in general the twists,0.059796683
the turns the little events beautiful loved it lil rel Howery plays the best friend,0.05912352
rod Williams and he is such a necessary character he is the goofy funny best,0.22709611
friend the TSA agent he is perfect in this movie he really balances out he's,0.068160705
like the sweet to the sour chicken and the casting was just my excelente Bradley,0.09235809
Whitford I just wanted to say as Dean Armitage as a father he's an actor,0.053108927
that I didn't think could be scary and Stern but he brought it in this,0.015927156
movie he makes you comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time Missy the mother played,0.036733437
by Catherine Keener also in the same realm she's like sweet french toast you know,0.03253014
a woman that you would just picture as just the sweetest but she has moments,0.057875633
of seriousness in this movie that gave me chills I have to say the sunken,0.059351012
place is a brilliant invention and it describes so many moments in life so perfectly,0.04084161
being trapped within yourself not being able to speak up when there are things that,0.06885582
you want to say feeling powerless that's exactly what the sunken place is it's when,0.035180897
you are put in a situation where you feel powerless and it's such an accurate,0.089765206
metaphor for how Chris feels in this environment look Keith Stanfield plays Andre and he,0.014826278
is one of my favorite actors do Momo he's a character in Atlanta and I,0.029184267
really love this actor and he was also brilliantly cast the moment with the flash,0.030469403
and his panic oh there was so much fear in his eyes so much presence,0.14686789
the Keith man that is one actor to follow and I'm rooting for him all,0.020287436
day okay now I'm gonna get into a real spoilery moment so you've been warned,0.2879597
the ending spoiled apparently there was an alternative ending to this movie where instead of,0.08136127
our man lil rel showing up the cops would show up and it was actually,0.09160843
going to end a lot darker than it did and I'm very glad that they,0.14077614
rewrote the ending and made it light and heroic and we got justice in that,0.02488585
moment because ah life is already sad enough we don't need that we need heroes,0.041718323
in most horror movies the protagonist gets away he survives and he walks into the,0.101196386
sunset usually with a woman on his arm so I'm really glad that they treated,0.2358291
this as such and gave us a breath of fresh air um TSA yeah handle,0.03702479
that I also thought that moment with Chris and Rose where he was choking the,0.042516544
life out of her was interesting she was smiling some people didn't know how to,0.0510881
interpret that I felt like she was smiling at the fact that she felt she,0.024769444
was winning in this moment like she was being proven right that's the stereotypical angry,0.054624215
animalistic murderous black man is in all black men and she pulled it out of,0.7966525
him I think that's what he felt it kind of brought him back to Oh,0.04298683
I am sinking to your level right now and I'm not gonna do that and,0.10339681
I don't know race had nothing to do with it if anyone gets treated the,0.1592862
way Chris hasn't had been treated oh that girl had to go I mean it,0.077264406
would have been justified I'm not on the side of murderer I just want to,0.2251564
make that clear I'm just saying it would have been justified and it was funny,0.048231136
watching this movie has a mixed person the black side of me was like no,0.1825989
man get out get out um I'm sensing danger things are weird especially with Caleb,0.034529682
the younger brother after that scene in the dinner mm-hmm but the white side of,0.029789584
me was like oh we should stay and investigate I mean you never know maybe,0.043295473
he could uncover something maybe Rose is right maybe we should give her the benefit,0.01664489
of the doubt you know maybe he needs to go into the crawl spaces into,0.08020585
her room into that cabinet see what's going on um don't go there don't open,0.046551548
that cabinet leave so yeah being mixed in a horror movie there aren't many of,0.06376583
us but we usually die medium you know not at the beginning but we don't,0.26239464
