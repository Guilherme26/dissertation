Angola that soundtrack the glitch out but I'm gonna have to keep it real and,0.16499548
say that y'all mighta overhyped us a little bit hey everyone is Sharonda from paperweights,0.04268683
and today i'm going to be reviewing a star is born which is a bradley,0.048068833
cooper directorial debut and also a star's bradley cooper and Lady gaga so basically this,0.124448545
is this is the 40 it's the 4th okay you know what I always complaining,0.04422407
about reboots remake this the fourth day I'm a star is born' okay yeah but,0.05474661
I have to say it was entertaining to watch I actually had the chance to,0.032528147
see the 1976 version which starburns first race in and this kind of falls along,0.0904703
the same lines what I did not do is I waited until it after I,0.042293705
saw a star is born in theaters first to not ruin any plot wise to,0.032880027
watch the 1976 version which is the most recent version before this that was remade,0.03313413
and so they kind of fall along the same lines there are subtle differences and,0.03496205
things that happen but the gist of the story is exactly the same and so,0.017244887
this film centers around Bradley Cooper who plays he's a famous musician called Jackson Maine,0.050388325
and he meets Allie who is played by Lady Gaga who was an aspiring singer,0.03771392
they happened to meet by chance in the neck fall madly in love and basically,0.11891022
he kind of helps catapult her career in to stardom and so then it kind,0.058395144
of just details as she's having this starting her career it kind of showcases their,0.0525076
love story which is Voki depressing as hell and also to kind of how their,0.21098627
relationship begins to like break down due to Jackson's alcohol and drug addiction and so,0.023860138
I have to say like you know first I was hearing everyone talk about this,0.04507883
when they were coming out of tip now it's like okay like I'm geeked about,0.07263938
this and it's like oh my gosh is movie is so good but let's see,0.04848324
Lady Gaga Oscar Oscar Oscar everybody's gonna get an Oscar nomination for this film so,0.07102698
I was absolutely actually excited to see this I've always loved Lady Gaga as a,0.04323228
singer always says she can say and baby the music in this movie is on,0.04426664
points like on point-to-point and Bradley Cooper okay I see you what you learn yellow,0.13282986
voice you can say a little bit of stuff you took lessons to voice lessons,0.025056804
learn how to sing to play guitar and I think that it actually pays off,0.07588149
and you can definitely tell it the chemistry between these two I think that helped,0.011418543
believe their relationship it helped make a better movie because they just look great together,0.026868762
but what I would have to say is that Bradley Bradley had me thinking that,0.033989552
he was like really an alcoholic in real life like he just been hiding this,0.18280776
whole time from all of us because the way that he was like moving talking,0.04042454
I say Bradley are you okay like did you really get drunk I'm scared for,0.11745015
you okay so I thought that his performance is very convincing and I thought Lady,0.09998641
Gaga was great as well um even the cinematography there's a scene like when they,0.062138796
first meet in the beginning of the film and he kind of touches her face,0.10622051
and then how the camera shoots to like her eyes so you can kind of,0.42371354
is almost like I could feel him touching my face I wish he was touching,0.47097492
my face but he wasn't touching my face but I thought that parts of this,0.24401729
movie was beautifully shot especially the performance scenes like it felt like I was watching,0.0700179
like one of those backs backstage you know how to do like behind the music,0.049167715
or behind the concert or something I felt like I was right there with them,0.04209881
and so I think that Bradley Cooper was very smart for choosing a star is,0.03428822
born I think they made this relevant to the times today I think that he,0.03312282
even upped the ante of things that happen in this film versus the 1976 version,0.030418849
but I think that Lady Gaga is just she's lovely to watch on screen was,0.062564515
she singing like you just feel everything I know that they both helped write the,0.04469369
songs they co-wrote the songs with one another and I was saying like if I,0.025381412
had to say some of the things that kind of let me down was I,0.05290139
almost feel as though I didn't read any reviews going into this movie but I,0.018389666
was just looking at social media reactions from people who I follow on my timeline,0.025036182
and I felt as though because they hyped it up so much that like my,0.049063947
bar was set to another level going into the movie which is why I kind,0.076562636
of felt like is this with the fuss like what was the fuss all about,0.04632605
like what was everyone having a damn heart attack over and it doesn't take away,0.37872973
this is a very good movie I think that anyone who goes to see this,0.041462228
movie I think that they will really enjoy it it's a love story it hits,0.044629168
hips on drug addiction or alcoholism even codependency on one another in a relationship and,0.05021937
I would have to say that this movie Islam there's only like two hundred fifteen,0.31062055
minutes and it felt like three hours at one point I was like y'all can,0.04679833
you hurry up and wrap this up because I'm starting to get a little bored,0.13244139
and I feel as though that I wanted to see a little bit more into,0.06410641
Ali's background through conversations you kind of learn about Jackson's demons it kind of what,0.17590715
has led him into this downward Aspire of drugs and alcohol but I wish they,0.14153245
kind of would have talked about it or showed it a little bit more and,0.03507447
I wanted to learn even more about Ali and I almost made me feel as,0.073140934
though I was watching a one-sided story kind of from his point of view on,0.021358382
how their relationship was instead of seeing like how she felt I felt like some,0.033246543
how they had to react to certain things in the film just wasn't really realistic,0.020345973
she almost just never worried she never expressed how she felt about me it was,0.07881894
always about Jackson and making sure that he was okay so I just kind of,0.042100802
wanted to see the other side internally like how does she really feel about where,0.02569804
the relationship was going especially as she's being catapulted into Fame and how she was,0.03871502
dealing with both of those at the same time but overall I would still say,0.03539043
pay to go see this film in theaters I'm not sure about how I feel,0.046151772
about saying that this is gonna be like oscar-nominated I think is gonna have a,0.018231353
lot of buzz and I have a lot of popularity especially with the music so,0.021960372
I would definitely tell you how to go ahead and go download the damn soundtrack,0.5296324
I already downloaded shallow because this song was hidden but I would have to wait,0.08987695
to see all the movies that are coming out during Oscar season to really say,0.013871075
like okay like they better get an Oscar nomination I just don't know right now,0.07977348
I'm on the fence but as always those are my thoughts on the star is,0.020347968
