hey guys it's Mariana and today we're talking about Mad Max fury road this movie,0.07950076
is directed by George Miller just like the previous three and it stars Tom Hardy,0.011672643
Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult now I went into this movie with really high expectations,0.063438565
because not only wasn't excited after watching the Mad Max trailers which I thought looked,0.059724845
awesome and I never got tired of seeing those trailers but I also was really,0.033191334
hyped up just all my own because I'm marathoned the first three Mad Max movies,0.067642525
right before I went to see Mad Max fury road so I had pretty high,0.08743773
expectations for this and this movie still blew my mind I am so excited about,0.09778199
this movie that I can't even begin to tell you and I am obviously going,0.095978685
to try to tell you because I'm doing a review but yeah I'm excited my,0.055703808
first thought after the movie ended was how am I ever going to watch another,0.027359668
action movie because this film was everything I wanted it to be and more the,0.04928878
premise of this movie is pretty simple we have Tom Hardy as Mad Max who,0.07739678
by the way looks fine who is captured by this group of really strange people,0.025149928
who are ruled by a crazy looking dude with a skeleton mask on his face,0.38345316
you probably remember him from the trailer you can't miss him he looks crazy and,0.16973957
fun fact he's actually played by the same actor who played the villain in the,0.037463807
first Mad Max movie which they're completely different people but it's still kind of eight,0.09105499
so this group of people almost feels like a cult because they pretty much worship,0.15533368
their leader and then one of the people there is Shirley's Erin's character furiosa and,0.03367492
she is actually trying to get out of that situation and so we have her,0.030799998
getting out the crazy people chasing her and Max is kind of just caught between,0.16909766
the two sides now if you have never seen a Mad Max film before the,0.027009781
trailer is a very accurate representation of this movie it is crazy chaotic insane post-apocalyptic,0.19246955
action that's what this movie is I absolutely love the world George Miller created for,0.03423035
the Mad Max franchise it is so weird and so crazy and if you're somebody,0.17278677
who enjoys dystopian post-apocalyptic worlds I think you're going to find this fascinating there are,0.12159557
so many crazy details and you can tell that every single thing and every single,0.0891692
person in this world has some kind of function like they're not just there to,0.06580662
look crazy they actually have a backstory and a reason to be there the action,0.09121597
in this movie like I said before is mind-blowing it is beautiful first of all,0.10515356
it looks realistic it looks like something that can actually happen it is not all,0.020601403
green-screen CGI it looks amazing people get hurt things break not that it's great when,0.037403278
people get hurt but you know what I mean like we don't have invincible characters,0.17862043
which is so annoying in action films I was legitimately concerned about everybody in this,0.07843513
movie because people then just walk things off second of all there's none of that,0.04388682
shaky-cam stuff that is so annoying in movies these days you can see everything that's,0.10365889
going on you can see these beautiful shots of chaos unfolding in front of you,0.18657936
and there is this one particular scene that really had an effect on me for,0.036301732
some reason because it was towards the beginning it is a scene where the characters,0.03794008
go into a sandstorm and it just looks like all hell broke loose on earth,0.2876763
this movie also has an amazing soundtrack which is something that I wondered about because,0.043334052
often I see trailers using music that isn't actually in the movie and I can,0.011992596
tell you that the epic music from the trailer is in the movie and it,0.027649023
is stunning it just all fits together there's even a guy in this movie whose,0.08449562
sole purpose is to stand on top of this truck while it's driving places and,0.0308286
to play an electric guitar that also spits out fire occasionally that is how crazy,0.21583547
this movie is and I was a big fan of this guy because that was,0.07673492
just wild of course all of the actors did an amazing job Tom Hardy as,0.043282833
Mad Max is really solid I really like Tom Hardy but I was a little,0.037219685
bit concerned about him because Mel Gibson as Mad Max is excellent but I was,0.11504883
pretty impressed Charlize Theron s furiosa is pretty much the ultimate badass and then Nicholas,0.14882486
Hoult plays this really insane character it's great they all did a fantastic job I,0.16927727
have nothing bad to say about this movie now the question that you might be,0.040517665
asking yourself is whether or not you need to see the original three movies to,0.0246843
watch Mad Max fury road and my answers is yes and no if you're concerned,0.088150136
that you're going to be confused about what's going on like the plot is going,0.020754395
to not make sense you don't need to see them this movie stands perfectly on,0.04647505
its own however I would definitely recommend seeing the original three movies a because they're,0.035803508
great movies well third ones kind of rocky but it still has really good moments,0.038006596
be it's really interesting to observe the progression of this post-apocalyptic world because you can,0.027958333
see things getting worse and worse with every movie and crazier and crazier so that's,0.25022304
really interesting and in the second movie Mad Max road warrior you also get to,0.054179206
see a little bit of the history of how things happened so if you're interested,0.028609548
in that definitely see the first three movies and also you don't get as much,0.037570238
character development with max in this particular movie they kind of go over his origins,0.0734243
a little bit in the beginning however if you want to know how this guy,0.033044327
went from a pretty normal person who was a reckless cop to this insane shell,0.18861082
of a man you obviously need to watch the previous movies so for plot you,0.068661585
don't really need to see them but you really should see them now guys because,0.047181476
I'm apparently a very mean and demanding movie watcher and reviewer I have not given,0.022088753
a single 5 out of 5 rating to a movie that I saw that came,0.04124338
out this year and Mad Max fury road gets five out of five stars from,0.056360345
