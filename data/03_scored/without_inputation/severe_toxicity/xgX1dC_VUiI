hey guys so today I am going to be talking about Thor Ragnarok the new,0.038363136
addition to the MCU franchise I'm excited for this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it,0.050351743
so let's just talk all things this is a non spoiler like all of my,0.06215343
refuse there's no spoiler so don't worry because I know it hasn't come out in,0.027882503
the US yet and like many other countries so I guess just get straight into,0.06914983
it personally I'm gonna start off with the characters I thought they did a fantastic,0.09336518
job with the characters in this film with new additions and also coming back to,0.033728138
a lot of characters we already know and a style off with Thor Chris Hemsworth,0.021412928
is such a hilarious guy in real life and I feel like Thor has had,0.07629856
that he's kind of had this sort of fish-out-of-water sort of thing of about him,0.072687276
throughout the franchise since event the Avengers so I've been kind of waiting for them,0.030323062
to take this direction with him and I'm really happy that they did that they,0.041158903
embraced his humorous side I think they did that really really well with his character,0.027713547
so that really pleased me and Chris Hemsworth is Thor like I don't picture anyone,0.06326961
else as Thor so I think it was fantastic again also the Hulk the Hulk,0.039648272
I was actually really excited for in this movie because we don't get much of,0.047434244
him in the previous film so I was like okay what's it going to be,0.056813337
like and I think this is probably the best version of the Hulk we have,0.030996893
gotten because we've seen so much of Bruce Banner and there isn't as much of,0.018712947
him in this film as in Bruce whenever he is on screen majority of the,0.02084486
time it's the Hulk which I was happy with because I wanted to see that,0.028242366
other side to him and I think the banter back and forth and the friendship,0.032757632
relationship between Thor and Hulk was just absolutely perfect they worked so well off each,0.01944864
other I think they're different humor just reflecting each other and it just it worked,0.026800914
then we have Halle who is played by Kate Blanchet fellow Aussie and I was,0.07641164
excited for her as a villain because you know she looked like this serious like,0.1534745
villainous woman that was gonna be like real strong and everything and I was just,0.081534885
like can't wait to see her and she was a total badass I just loved,0.29848126
her look her style and aesthetic just looked perfect I loved her whole costume and,0.09155654
everything awesome she's kind of like this femme fatale sort of feeling to her I,0.09872323
really enjoyed her character but she's not my favorite villain she wasn't in it as,0.10587662
much as I thought she would be but also like just in the scale of,0.056955684
villains she's not up there up there with me I don't know why she just,0.22505464
didn't she was good she was a good villain but she wasn't like my favorite,0.11501225
of all the time like it won't be lucky sorry sorry lucky he has the,0.032689784
top notch he's he's up this Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson another awesome kick-ass female,0.6512066
character I thought she was a great addition to the team but I just want,0.018102974
to go straight on to one of my favorite characters of this film and another,0.049608067
standout Loki Tom Hiddleston just his character as Loki is absolutely perfect every single time,0.029640583
he is fantastic I love his character he's such a complex character that has had,0.013392808
lots of time throughout this franchise to expand and flesh out his character so seeing,0.03167937
him in this film you see even more of that especially his relationship with Thor,0.040383965
you get a lot of those sort of moments as character moments between the two,0.020194976
of them which I really liked seeing their dynamic again because he's not a good,0.16844046
guy and he's not like an evil guy he's like that in-between and I love,0.2416724
how they balance out his character in that way considering the direction that Marvel wanted,0.053345732
to take with this movie I think Tiger OTD was an absolutely perfect choice the,0.076927826
director for this film I think he was fantastic I love his style and I,0.04985285
think that he works so well with the tone of this of this film overall,0.05663573
the comedy hilarious the writing and the dialogue was just outstanding when it came to,0.02850711
the humor each character had its own their own sort of take on it which,0.027822636
I thought was really good and I was laughed out loud the whole cinema was,0.026918652
just like enjoying it so much and it was a great atmosphere to be in,0.032168947
I think Tiger bootys comedic style really stood out in this movie and wasn't like,0.104648024
immature childish humor it's very smart intelligent humor which I really liked the comedy wasn't,0.15160534
you know sort of toilet humor or anything like that it wasn't kiddush it didn't,0.11690403
like bring down any of the comedy or anything like that so I think that,0.094792664
tiger TT just nailed that criteria section of a Marvel movie the balance between fantasy,0.06415297
in action with comedy comedy as well as sort of character moments I thought was,0.036008388
really good I enjoyed that it wasn't it wasn't like a typical and Cu movie,0.06864895
I mean most of them alike you have a lot of action and a lot,0.043992586
of stuff between all the characters and sort of jokes sprinkled throughout the film whereas,0.015919175
this one the action wasn't as prominent the action wasn't like a big spectacle there,0.04508748
are a couple of scenes that were standout moments which were awesome but then the,0.01812559
rest of it there wasn't a lot of action to go from so don't expect,0.036120802
it to be nonstop action from what we did get in the action scenes I,0.018164169
think was great because it showed off how powerful these characters are Thor and Hulk,0.017791001
I don't think you get to see as much of how powerful they are I,0.036017034
mean thought is a God and you kind of forget how strong they are when,0.03767068
they're with the other Avengers because you have to pay so much attention to the,0.019365491
other characters the CGI and green-screen um Hulk was probably the best most well done,0.011968649
CG aspect to the film I think he looks so realistic but there were definitely,0.029437037
obvious moments where as a little messy green-screen was like it wasn't up to par,0.061429046
and the special effects just wasn't what I wanted and what I would expect so,0.025636178
I was a bit disappointed in that aspect how it fits into the MCU it,0.087712444
is definitely more of a standalone film it has subtle connections to the rest of,0.033954963
the franchise obviously but its style and how Tiger BTT was able to implement his,0.06239622
own style I'd have a little bit more freedom and flexibility I think makes it,0.08228255
stand out from others so it's definitely part of the MCU no way is it,0.045184594
just like its own movie it's not part of it but it definitely has its,0.026615994
own thing going on so unlike so there was something a little different but you,0.04581785
still have that and see you feel to it so if you're into superhero movies,0.029939916
it's definitely still a superhero movie and there are some subtle cameos just put it,0.025055472
out there so keep your eye out so before I see big movies like these,0.071309015
I don't watch any reviews I don't read any I don't look at readings it,0.027690265
weeks nothing until I see it so I didn't do that before this movie I,0.032061186
didn't know I heard heard that it was getting positive stuff but I didn't know,0.021196742
anything in depth no spoilers nothing so that's why I didn't want to do a,0.01758546
spoiler review for all of you guys because I that hasn't come out everywhere so,0.04335534
don't judge the film from just reviews that you've seen go in enjoy it hopefully,0.017751755
you liked it hopefully you enjoy the comedy because there is a lot in this,0.047689676
film if you have seen the film let me know what you think hope you,0.05360715
