a honey year before Batman V Superman wait Wonder Woman's old she look good our age this movie takes place a hundred years before Bambi Superman when we watch her grow up we see her as a kid teenager and the Wonder Woman she is to this day we also get a chance to see the first time her and Steve Trevor meet where she goes in save him which was a beautiful scene we also see them go to our world where they talk to some people some stuff happens and yada yada yada it save the date now the reason why I just did that y'all's because I didn't want to ruin the movie for you at all because there's certain plots in the story that can possibly ruin it for you so what did Jake do you think about this movie I have to say first thing I really enjoyed the music I really enjoyed it so much I want to go and buy the score the music was on point the music to me is what made the movie stay on beat the whole time the music was dope it the music had me a couple of times and certain scenes of music which is there I was like man yeah okay just this is a pretty quick score it's a pretty good score for a surreal movie you don't really get that all the time you know I mean next the story huh check us out there's always something wrong with something that you do I really like this story I'm gonna say this was probably this it's probably one of the best stories that I've seen in a superhero film however there's a smidgen of the story that I just did got like I swear it let me down y'all I was like oh why why did they do that it changed the story up a little bit it's a little different I was like man all right I guess it really hurt me man I was like why I can't say what it is yet it you check out the spoiler review but I'm gonna tell you but I can't say it because they were ruin it but I was like huh buddy do that and all of you do you did that you really whatever but the story was really good the story was good it was good probably one of the best stories in a superhero film that I've seen like for real the story kept you engaged like this is word is bond check us out when I went to watch this movie off I was I'm 31 years old I turned into 11 year old boy sitting in that seat I felt like Michael Jackson in the Thriller video if you're a wise market there's really video when he's in the theaters even popcorn that's how I was y'all I can't eat popcorn cuz I got braces but I had a hot daughter a hint no homo it was tight you know I mean I I was a little boy watching this movie I was so linking I was just paying attention to it I was excited you know I mean I cheered you know it was it was a great vibe the story kept me going the story the music it was perfect it worked that that was chemistry right there it's hard to get music in a story and have perfect chemistry this movie had a lot of good chemistry perfect chemistry next I have to say well let me go ahead and just let this out right now gal gadot Chris Pine they did they think they were amazing in this movie first let me go ahead and say this when they cast gal gadot for Wonder Woman I was not for it I was like I don't know man she kind of small man I don't know one of them is big I was one of those I was one of those guys you know me my song anyway I was one of those guys wait when I saw her in the Batman V Superman trailer I said well oh no man she she's she's small but one okay I'll take it let me see let me let me watch it because me and Jojo we were arguing and he was time I being athlete and I'll tell my cow and I was like you know what forget it give Ben a chance I'm gonna give God a chance and every sense that I gave her a chance I was like okay let me see how she's gonna turn up and when I saw the trailer I was like okay I'm rolling with this one and then when they finally came with that Wonder Woman trailer and you guys go back and watch my archive go back and watch mark I actually should be a above right now go back and watch those trailer review trailer reactions because I talked a lot about it but my gosh she was better than I ever thought she could be I never thought she would have that inner and and I mean that was the most respect she was amazing she was Wonder Woman oh my gosh the ladies and gentlemen the story was done so well guys you guys are let me break this down watching gal on the island of the mascara was dope the costumes won't point guys I really felt like I was there watching the sisters the Amazon warriors care for that woman that girl that little that little baby was amazing I love the fact that we got a chance to see the the the Amazons and there were all different different cultures you know I mean they were all one they were also super they're all different cultures I love the costume design I love how they had like the black the sisters the black ones and their hair they didn't they didn't they didn't look fake you know I mean they didn't look fake at all I didn't they look authentic they had the thick hair but they put it back till they combed it it was perfect I loved every bit of it dope gal though stood out like a sore thumb and I mean in a good way when she spoke there at home that accident works that accident I never was against accident now oh I love the fact when when when they stay true to the character in that form that accent worked because it made her even more exotic watching you you felt she was authentic she'll authentic Amazon and I loved every bit of it she did her thing with that she truly from beginning from seeing her from the beginning she truly made me believe that she's one a woman I believe she was wondering when I was about to be Superman but when I got a chance to see the origin of her I was like oh my god she's really Wonder Woman because she stood for everything one of them instead for and it's not just power just as in truth autocrat like that it's the woman she was young but she was a sister she was a hunt she was a cousin she was a grand mom she she was all the women in the world and you can fill it off of her she was perfect perfect when she met Chris Pines Steve Trevor it was I I kid you not guys it was magic it was magic watching those two on screen together they had a great chemistry this movie has a lot of good chemistry those two it was like I kid you not it was like watching them from just watching this like watching this show and you see them and it shows on for ten years and you watch them grow and have kids in the family that's how it was that chemistry was perfect it was it was innocent it was sweet it was funny it was caring it was sad it was every emotion you can have and you can see him this has to be Chris Pines probably the best role he's ever done because you can see the acting chops he has I see two actors she's actor to actor is an actor that elevated their skills to the max in this film and my gosh it worked I felt like those two knew that they're going to show up the world and they both on the same page with it and it worked that chemistry between those two was beautiful I loved every bit of it guys I mean it was so sweet watching them it was dope was the same it was it was it was three scenes that I will never forget and I loved I have to say a little bit something it was a scene you guys see when they're not when when they showed them in like a like a water room or something like that like a little cave or something was probably one of the funniest things that I ever experienced in a superhero I loved every bit of it because it wasn't necessarily meant to be funny it was logical and it was dope at the same time because it was real the movie felt real it felt real it was vibrant it felt real it didn't feel like a comic-book movie it felt like it felt like a a Greek mythology story that actually really happened it felt like a biblical story that actually happened it worked guys my gosh it worked those two on camera magic shout out the GAO shout-out to Chris Pine doing your thing that right there it's gonna be hard to replicate that I've never seen that in a superhero movie never never beautiful beautiful moments right there with them - oh my gosh I can't wait to talk about him huh that was tight next the directing guys the directing oh my gosh this uh you remember this the music the story chemistry the actors the actors and actors chemistry the chemistry mixed with the story and the music this was a beautiful web going on right now let's get into the director of the movie miss patty Jenkins patty Jenkins outdid herself in this movie I remember we went back we went back we go back let's go back a couple months right and I went to WonderCon with my boys you know Judy Joe Savin Jackson you know ap5 we was there it was a couple other people who didn't show up but we went we got a chance to watch patty Jenkins and a couple of scenes of Wonder Woman I was when I are your life when I saw that I was sold on the movie when I saw a scene I was like oh my gosh this is tight she explained what she was trying to do what she wanted to do with the film she says she wanted to make a Richard Donner film she wanted to go Casablanca and I see the Casablancas vibe with those two characters bad Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor I see it I see it oh man I see it is there she went that Lois and Clark bye I telling you guys is there it's beautiful love right there so sorry so but when I got a chance to watch it this woman I is amazing she knows how to capture the right scene at the right time it's amazing guys from seeing the mascara the beautiful landscape watching the the costume of the the Amazons and their costumes and looking so authentic such a beautiful vibe the whole time watching young Diana as the issue is forget her name her name is Emily something I can't remember but she played young Princess Diana she was beautiful she's a little girl and she's a thorn her thing you could see the the curiosity in her head you can see she wanted to be something greater for someone to capture stuff like that that's amazing guys this project is that her thing in this movie she directed so many scenes and they were all amazing I didn't know she knew how to direct action guys I didn't know I was shocked the action scenes in this movie are are on point I'm gonna be honest machine the action seems to me personally and this is not being biased or anything the action seems just basically say this take Winter Soldier right take Winter Soldier before Bucky takes his mask off all that before Bucky takes his mask off take Winter Soldier and then add it in with Man of Steel that's what you get you get a complete believable facing because you know she's Wonder Woman so she gonna do things some some things like Superman but the the the the choreography of the fight scenes are like Winter Soldier so it works it works in the time frame it is dope the actions she did her thing on those actions things the action scenes are on point that right there was the shocker for me because before before I see what I saw at WonderCon I was always worried about okay well she got a fight how's she gonna get down you know I mean I know gal has a background in military uh she was in a military so she has a background of that military training all that stuff like that so I was like okay how they gonna use her how are you gonna use her and they use their well she was on point Wonder Woman action scenes were my god why I can't believe I'm gonna say this this is real true spit was better than bad be Superman it was better than the Batman warehouse scene it was better than that and let me explain the reason why it was better than that is because it was God doing most of that on some note some notes and then explained that the warehouse scene was planned Batman planned that he knew I mean people was in a room he knew this Wonder Woman was a warrior y'all she didn't count how many people on the field didn't why didn't she just wait and served them all up that's why it gets the edge of a Batman's fight scene for me because she went in there with her eyes closed she was blindfolded and she handled business that's why she gets the edge over the Batman V Superman fight scene now personally got all the Batman scene I want the Fighting's I've seen when her soldier and that Batman warehouse was on point no for real but wonder woman gets the cake on that y'all she gets that that that fight scene was tight guys I was in the audience and some stuff happened and I can I was tight and everybody's looking at me they was looking at me I was like what you looking at that was trying I was excited when I saw that man I was excited when I saw that that was dope way anyway moving on actually sings on point hey Jenkins director dope that was that was amazing I shocked shocked by how well this film was put together in the chemistry base and it makes sense the director held his movie together but casting didn't let nobody stop they helped they held it I felt like they held each other together Chris was like you know God I know people hating on you and I'm gonna help you out and she was like thank you and I'm gonna make sure that what you do for me ain't gonna do it is it's like that's how I felt like they were I felt like and I don't know if this is true but I really felt like he was like a real friend to her it was like look I know us a lot of haters out there but we gonna make sure we give a hundred and thirty-five percent and you can feel it you can see the way they looked at each other it was like a real true friendship and they held each other together throughout this film with the support of director and the story and the music shouts to Geoff Johns and the music it was a great triangle guys it really worked this movie was tight I love this movie guys this was a great film enjoyed it I can't wait to purchase it I can't wait to watch it again I know personally I'm gonna watch this movie at least ten times in theaters guys I ignore him because I'm a Dark Knight I watched it 18 times but I know my worst movie least ten times I gotta take my daughter it's summers hitting up we gonna be in theater watching this movie you know I mean I I know I'm gonna watch it I know I'm gonna enjoy it it's gonna be a great experience watching of multiple times this film is dope guys please go watch this movie we need these type of movies to grow because if they grow now Warner Brothers knows that's for real they need to know this is how you make a movie because this gives other movies hope the hope that we need the the the the spirit of the comic book world for real keeping the 100 now a lot of people were saying that oh let me get your great before I do that I give Wonder Woman that's what I give this movie this is the best superhero origin film of all time as of now nothing is topping this movie as of now people can argue but I'm explaining why you can't argue with this because Wonder Woman is a true superhero film Dark Knight Batman you'll got no powers bruh that's what it is yeah he has that out because I'm Batman we got no powers Dark Knight is good for the best realistic hero film all time anyway topping that and he's been as of now name of topping it but comic book movie Wonder Woman and the best origin story even beat my battle against I love this origin story this ordnance story was tight I loved every bit of this this is what we call an epic origin I loved it I learned so much about Wonder Woman in this story guys the story was so dope man there was a scene when she had a language battle with a dude I mean she had a language battle he was like this guy right here knows a bunch of languages as soon as I only she's tight this is Wonder Woman this is dope loved it great film guys great film
