action is arguably the defining characteristic of a cinema the one thing that no other,0.061011832
medium of art can replicate even throughout the silent film era with innovators like Charlie,0.081889294
Chaplin and Buster Keaton action was the tool for storytelling that was completely unique to,0.045313418
film cinema the silent era I'm talking they were able to do things that you,0.062733345
could see nowhere else it wasn't a recording device it was actually creating a language,0.07288145
most of this new language we call film language it's only about 120 years old,0.09170891
it's an acquired language and it's always evolving and most of it was defined pretty,0.086181074
sound before there was dialogue or sound effects the strength of the film rested entirely,0.048296116
on the strength of its visual action its ability to convey meaning with a moving,0.051861364
image and to create an effective illusion through use of force prospective matte paintings or,0.06260511
through editing tricks often depicting seemingly death-defying stunts that captivated audiences all over the world,0.12078251
the same is true of today where action is one of the key ingredients for,0.023178885
a successful blockbuster every major movie franchise boasts a healthy amount of action and regardless,0.05919502
of genre or target audience action seems to be the one component to a film,0.0786236
that offers something for everyone across all ages and cultures but somehow even with action,0.047615204
appearing virtually everywhere Mad Max fury road managed to stand taller than any of its,0.21347022
counterparts by a mile most films start with the script but George Miller decided from,0.0543896
the very beginning that this film needed to work visually before anything else so one,0.06413462
of my notions was that if I make it as the action sequences as a,0.028175848
silent and it reads as a silent movie then it can only get better with,0.069965355
self I differently had the Hitchcock dictum in my head and definitely he said I,0.21306342
try to make movies where they don't have to read the subtitles in Japan the,0.10232691
film was conceived as one long chase sequence told through very little dialogue or exposition,0.06294235
so Miller in collaboration with Brendan McCarthy opted out of a traditional script and instead,0.07592205
"drafted storyboards for the entire film that ended up totaling over 3,500 separate images representing",0.07467686
a comprehensive shot list for every planned sequence to be filmed using what he had,0.12301037
learned on happy feet a 3d animated film that allowed for complete freedom of camera,0.117394835
movement he took that same sense of freedom into Mad Max where advancements in filmmaking,0.18465205
technology and special effects would allow him to do things he could never even imagine,0.109403655
doing back in the 1970s but just like with the original trilogy the entire design,0.062242366
behind the film is grounded in reality by establishing a clear set of storytelling rules,0.046988267
the kind of rules who would - that everything was basically found objects repurposed so,0.15160863
if you notice that the mask that max wears is made from a garden fork,0.1307183
the the vehicles had to be vehicles which didn't have the most modern technology with,0.031454664
micro processes and crunch technology and so on so everything had to work for that,0.11169216
lot logic found objects are repurposed and their that also applied to costume and language,0.108923644
and the other thing we said is we said that just because it's the wasteland,0.10084658
it doesn't mean people can't make beautiful things so all of that sort of unified,0.16045742
the film - something we were quite rigorous about those sort of things everything came,0.05530284
about out of story and that would lead to the stunt the guys on the,0.08433136
poles you know it's like pirates having to board a well-defended maury you can't approach,0.18882596
it from the ground but if they can approach it from above even in what's,0.049805015
essentially a non-stop action film storytelling comes before anything else every moment of action comes,0.090680234
from the choices of its characters in extreme circumstances those trying to survive or those,0.054680306
trying to die historic on the fury road its mythology is so effectively established its,0.1488675
imagery so immediately evocative that we instantly understand what these characters are after and why,0.09957357
everyone in this story is one way or another a commodity Max is a blood,0.297104
bag the girls of boot breed is war boys the cannon fodder and everyone has,0.6225463
brand on them so that you didn't have to get too much exposition you knew,0.10499413
that people were just running away with this foundation of storytelling in place they designed,0.24195558
every piece of clothing every weapon and every vehicle to fit within the wasteland in,0.16804947
the world of Mad Max cars have essentially become religious artifacts and as such every,0.2398345
component of every vehicle is designed to fit the specific character from the hundreds of,0.05104142
unique steering wheels to the intricate detailing of the warlords million Thrones every single vehicle,0.039271362
was fully customized and fully functional because Miller never intended to make a green-screen movie,0.05013166
he wanted everything to be done practically if it could and that meant creating over,0.068725005
a hundred unique vehicles that could drive at full speed at across the desert with,0.0474905
everything rooted in logic and physics even when the action feels larger-than-life it never feels,0.0803131
impossible everything that we're seeing could theoretically happen within the fictional universe that Miller created,0.06652743
and I think that believability is crucial to its success but its believability is earned,0.02958705
over 80% of the stunts and effects seen on screen were practical in-camera effects including,0.033936318
the doof wagon complete with fully functional flame-throwing guitar or the blood bag sequence and,0.24232017
even the infamous polecat scene was done the on location in camera with stunt performers,0.18643728
being filmed while swinging on a giant pendulum on a moving vehicle nearly everything you,0.105837114
see in the finished film was done for real every chase every every explosion and,0.12116896
it's impossible not to feel the sheer visceral energy pumping throughout as a result but,0.06311719
while the film uses practical effects whenever possible and is better for it it's a,0.0354786
film that could not and would not exist without an extensive use of CGI and,0.100021146
Miller uses it in subtle ways throughout most of the film usually to erase stunts,0.074234344
rigging or tire tracks for multiple takes films in the same location there is some,0.07012172
digital face replacing to better hide stun doubles and most frequently it's used to composite,0.1253874
different shots together when it would be too dangerous to do it any other way,0.17104992
principle was let's do it old school and then augment it should we need to,0.057343654
with with with digitally I'm kind of averse to hundred percent CG shots if if,0.22838342
it can be avoided I always love to have some practical live-action element in there,0.06211823
to ground the shot even if you end up virtually replacing everything it still inherits,0.34739935
something from the original live-action that that is a valuable thing all in all I,0.13688146
think fury road is one of the great examples to study for understanding when and,0.048214708
how to use CGI versus when to use practical effects it's a tool like anything,0.08640988
else and when used properly can elevate a film beyond what would ever be possible,0.053073578
with practical effects alone but I think fury road makes the ultimate case for why,0.055279497
filmmakers should resist using too much CGI when it could be done practically instead because,0.065883644
CGI is great for certain things like removing something from a shot like wires or,0.31089434
dolly track or for seamlessly combining shots together but I doubt CGI could ever pull,0.102610864
off a shot like this as convincingly as Miller did with practical effects all films,0.18360345
are asking us to suspend our disbelief and to go on a journey but there's,0.05275273
a limit to what feels possible and all too often when overusing CGI or just,0.086487114
using it in the wrong ways it starts to feel less like human beings in,0.3772745
life-threatening situations and more like action figures being thrown around with no real consequence there's,0.11360477
a limit to what CG can believably accomplish and what human beings can believably do,0.15452018
even the superheroes and when the scope of action and movies continually gets stretched further,0.058231305
and further past the point of believability it loses all sense of tension and granted,0.07875971
these can still be fun movies to watch but they lack the same visceral gut,0.23448785
punch that I believe all great action movies should have with the acclaim rightfully directed,0.40334314
at films like Mad Max fury road Mission Impossible fall out or Dunkirk it seems,0.14901732
that most people feel the same way there's a yearning for larger-than-life action spectacle that,0.078079306
gives us a reason to see something on the big screen and both critics and,0.06724141
audiences alike seem to appreciate the films that strike the right balance between practical and,0.05799015
digital effects and I hope with the success of these films that more filmmakers will,0.10935696
take on that challenge because there's no doubt that it's harder fury road required seven,0.08279091
months of shooting in the Namibian desert with so much dust that they had to,0.31095418
use leaf blowers and special fit pipes to keep it all from obscuring the lens,0.104275584
working in harsh conditions doing incredibly dangerous stunts where there was constant risk of equipment,0.08005697
being destroyed or worse severe injury to the stunt teams directing a film of this,0.1522448
magnitude is like going to war I was talking - Peter where is a wonderful,0.1525455
Australian director and I just did ask it's so difficult it was it was like,0.059755947
walking a really big dog I wanted to go that way the dog dragged me,0.16678897
this way and he said with George all movies like that he said you've got,0.08429426
to go into a movie as if you are patrol in the jungle with the,0.18735011
platoon you don't know where the snipers are you don't know where the landmines are,0.24121192
and they're gonna come but you've got to complete the job you try to bring,0.15769096
it all together into that camera and capture it all it all the ingredients together,0.11205432
at that moment but there's a certain flexibility afloat you have to have and be,0.056067053
alert to those things but I think that hardship that elements of danger is felt,0.09018359
in the finished film and it pays off Mad Max fury road is action filmmaking,0.116779424
at its absolute finest and it raises the bar for what blockbuster cinema can be,0.057255693
