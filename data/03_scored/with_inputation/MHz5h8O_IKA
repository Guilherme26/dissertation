cost even Bernard Lee's in the film and in quite small corner Lee role from,0.021672042
him sorry and yeah basically one of my supreme films it's actually being named at,0.17244035
one point the greatest British film of all time and of course yes very famous,0.06186308
film and it's my third year of this film so yes frequently you know listed,0.093689874
as one of the best films all time on the science sound such like that,0.06077013
I'm DB it's in the top 250 I believe and yeah it's in Houston rotten,0.3324233
yeah 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and yeah it's just a very very loved film,0.15114658
and I first saw this in 2015 around that time when I you know first,0.053061057
watched Citizen Kane actually I kind of watch this in pretty very close proximity because,0.1017235
yeah just for awesome Welles really wowed me with Kane so I just I wanted,0.09226081
to watch this and I really could say that these two films actually other most,0.1094283
acclaimed ya see the most acclaimed overall films at Baltimore's Orson Welles is involved in,0.081958786
you know of course he didn't direct the film although that is actually controversial you,0.072873265
know some say I've said over the years it's kind of you know rumors that,0.11045384
he at least had a hand in some of the direction but certainly it's confirmed,0.08173895
that he did write along his own Alliance and basically a lot of the famous,0.07727792
the most famous lines from the film actually once he wrote but Graham Greene of,0.026635492
course was the main writer you know off the film and he actually wrote a,0.047635667
novella before this to prepare which is a really I think an idea that kind,0.07447667
of really makes sense to me to write a novella and then adapt it into,0.05422759
the script form I think that's kind of that's the most logical way really I,0.05660193
think it's always one I've always for you know of basically yeah this film you,0.14889018
know it's deserve a score as well it's very very famous of course the e,0.10272266
theme and just the theme music for our and Roger Ebert would say this is,0.06774939
one of the top ten films of all time at one point I believe and,0.07383744
yes I watched it and after Susan Cain of course which I absolutely love I,0.06811167
watched this I think and very closely and what I think this film is it,0.095457636
one of the best ones all time absolutely this is one of my absolute favorite,0.11038065
films a florist masterpiece and just perfect in its form in its tone you know,0.11595231
just everything about this film is mind blown one of the best fritters of all,0.29027802
time and awesome Welles is on fire in this film Joseph Cotten an absolutely wonderful,0.14736426
protagonist all performances out of alley Trevor Howard is just amazing in the film very,0.056382958
charming and the whole film has this charm yes about this Chandler's there and I,0.09563763
at the same time very very cynical and you know set in of course the,0.18421032
main plot which I won't get into too much you know it's basically Joseph Cotten,0.078526035
the beginning the film basically goes to Vienna it's post-world War two Vienna so it's,0.14768618
kind of war-torn country you know and all the buildings are different kind of element,0.10454142
destroyed half destroyed and of course there's loads of you know crime and poverty kind,0.45930487
of that's true and Joseph Cotten plays Holly Martin's who's basically a pope Western writer,0.0593418
so that's very very interesting I kind of loved films where it's always very interested,0.076802574
in you know when done well and the protagonist or someone is an actual writer,0.07401483
it kind of just you know is really interested in and when they actually kind,0.06462343
of discover things that are kind of play into the Conover stories they tell and,0.04132789
known for okay it worked perfectly here and he basically goes to Vienna because he's,0.10355196
told by Harry Lime who is basically he's played by Orson Welles in a film,0.09317947
and yes you know announcement now of course I'll just say now and I'll put,0.08472935
in the description possible spoilers because I can't really talk about film you know essentially,0.068009175
if you say awesome well is in the film and you know he's hairy like,0.13040231
you know some of them of course in fact that you know he's not dead,0.22570649
so there's a spoilers of course put warning in the description and yes it's I,0.12195405
suppose it's minor spoilers because how can you watch the film and know the lost,0.11453034
mothers in it and who plays and not expect him to be in there he,0.14990988
is in the film of course I didn't have to analysis very well but yeah,0.051583413
he's in the film and basically though it's believed at beginning that he is dead,0.18141337
and you know once shows of cotton you know arrives it's learned very very quickly,0.16610752
these dead and you know Harry Lime basically invited him in for a job he,0.40317395
offered him a job and basically yes Holly Martin's arrives and he's shocked and the,0.06758676
funeral he then basically things I'm right you know it doesn't seem right and you,0.31248826
know very very just mysterious the way happened and coincidental and just just not right,0.23377511
so he kind of starts to investigate and you know that many many different leads,0.06396967
and he follows one of the main ones being the cancer that out of Valley,0.24119055
plays and she basically she can't afford some but she was of course Harry limes,0.07404119
the lover and basically a very very complex relationship you've got this kind of triangle,0.31089434
going on unofficial triangle and yes basically it's basically yes Holly Martin's kind of discovering,0.2570349
or you know all the different clues and seeing you know different characters that were,0.035209913
involved with Harry Ron of course Anna of course who had a very plays it's,0.09166606
a big big big character there and that's she's the one that kind of adds,0.0981535
a lot of depth to this film and the relationships is all in a feather,0.09120878
from very complex and it's all kind of ties in Trevor Howard of course is,0.030223923
it is sergeant Calloway and he basically he has a very big pot rollin film,0.17481509
and he of course the gray masterful in the brief in the film brief encounter,0.09100551
good she's all mine absolutely loved and wonderful here I think he has so much,0.085793085
to the film just kind of the charm the kind of the comedy that comes,0.0814149
is a lot from him and yeah basically you could say it's a bit complex,0.18657707
on paper but the way it's told the plot it's very very clear storytelling and,0.09592819
it's never convoluted in front of that and it's just one of the most engaging,0.14407472
films I've ever seen and you know when I first saw it I was blown,0.17476301
away couldn't quite believe it it really did you know many had said is one,0.113957755
of the greatest problems I just kind of straight away I thought yes I agree,0.19077928
you know it's one of them films it's just so perfect you know in every,0.15288478
way subset the main plot and of course about 60 minutes in or after that,0.072418615
there is a massive reveal of course which I won't really get into too much,0.06638978
other than what a masterful review or one of the best in cinema and that,0.067764
is just it's just such an amazing moment the time in the end the build-up,0.05407393
the atmosphere the little hints here and there the involvement of course of the cats,0.071633995
look out for that I can't afford shadow it and you know just the actual,0.057441585
reveal itself you know and the camera movements and the way that the music is,0.063562945
used is just perfect that is just one of the best you know kind of,0.036938142
most kind of worthy moments in cinema for me I absolutely love that moment I'm,0.10233441
just so good an opportunist boy and of course the film was just so perfect,0.29085636
you know it draws you in straightaway I believe on this release Carol Reed narrated,0.072317354
but I'm not too sure on that and there's two different versions Joseph Cotten and,0.045233496
Calvary I think it was Carol reading this one but yes basically Australia join in,0.063550346
and you know editor to perfection the way the plot unfolds in this film it's,0.09837245
just masterful storytelling it's just mr. I was one of them thrillers that the plot,0.11097569
it's not you know completely taken over the characters the characters you know in the,0.041120294
atmosphere the city and all this gun stuff and the kind of emotion behind it,0.15104218
the values and you know the kind of morals that you know kind of gets,0.13987985
into it's all in harmony perfectly with the actual plot you know it's not filmed,0.06554625
this completely you know completely dialogue-driven the visual storytelling of course is very prominent you,0.062452376
know and of course you've got the famous Dutch angles the very program in the,0.08908556
film and it's just perfect the way that kind of creates this uneasy atmosphere that's,0.08030859
kind of look to the film all the close-ups as well you know of the,0.06327294
kind of even the background characters really early on creates like an atmosphere you know,0.06561396
an uneasy feel you know things you just kind of think of us weird something's,0.19717962
not right and it's just for the visuals alone that is the direction and cinematography,0.081487
is absolutely perfect in this film as well as just the lighting not just the,0.08463672
angles but the lighting is wonderful the zooms you know the you know the pushings,0.14975257
perfect the timing is key and it's perfect and of course adding to that you,0.05168204
know the actual River score it's just so perfect you know it's just Lester films,0.07729887
of flow and as forms of flows so wonderfully and it's just epic you know,0.08894452
just you know every time you know that kind of score comes on and you've,0.104170024
got the zooms that everything in addition the kind of plot points in the film,0.101157606
you know they kind of the notes the kind of perfectly fit into the intro,0.15438719
notes within the story it's just perfect it's just yeah just kind of give you,0.06073821
the shows at least it did for me and you know the characters in the,0.038262304
film you know I've actually got a film book that actually cites this you know,0.09693373
these characters the relationships dynamics you know in a way that it kind of it's,0.06109338
all part of this you know this circle it's all linked in and of course,0.07160083
you can study that and just really know how to tell a story level he,0.069481105
way the cancers or of rolling the story and the way of all kind of,0.08398835
they would have ripple effects you know and what they do in the film and,0.06981548
all the different you know prop ones and it's just so genius all the cancers,0.2826788
are so fully fleshed out even as well just the background characters and there's always,0.06261593
been some sort of comedy or just sense of dread as well at times and,0.15097876
you know it's just it's just so perfect you know I think the protagonist is,0.074751064
amazing it's gotten an amazing actor you know I'm not fan of him Heaven's Gate,0.14991307
but I'm a fan of most people in that film apart from Christopher Walken my,0.06628148
family film but really nice you know shadow of doubt is great in that Joseph,0.04787114
Cotten and Citizen Kane of course as well and of course it's great to see,0.080947496
you know Joseph Cotten an Orson Welles back together again after Citizen Kane you know,0.10189381
acting in the same film because they're just great to give you and I think,0.10969713
you know as well the actual the actual characters from they play you know Harry,0.029444106
Lime and of course Holly Martin's I think that the parent is great and the,0.07954972
dynamics you know kind of in the plays off the exposition is from you know,0.05373723
the backstory of you know how they were friends you know and they're younger and,0.08951298
just just the one that the exhibition is told for dialogue just adds so much,0.037815973
before the actual reveal happens and you kind of find out of course that Harry,0.11437665
lamb is not dead when they're together on screen it's just it's all the more,0.08127304
meaningful and just really massively complex relationship so much depth humanity to this from and,0.069180116
especially you know through this relationships and they have and the kind of the yeah,0.0676217
the backstory between a woman and the way that it kind of pans out as,0.27887145
well you know this film has got of course great comedy but it is also,0.12492341
sad at times and of course not meaty at least ER kind of thing and,0.15200575
I just think the dialogue was absolutely perfect in this film just you know all,0.06741378
the characters in Swan was just so good of course out of alley very very,0.05234129
complex and carrot sir and you know it's got some lifted moments between Aaron of,0.091322295
course Joseph Cotton's character but it has got its moving moments you know as well,0.038268235
and ones have really really touched you know touchy and I just think the way,0.35562685
it comes together at the end it's perfect you know I think of course the,0.07677067
end didn't was meant to be originally there's going to be a more happy ending,0.10577178
and you know if you probably anyway if you've seen some of my reviews you,0.12671404
know that I or maybe not I do Jenny for happy endings but it's great,0.077047475
when it director kind of writer goes for an ending where you know it is,0.10112511
more daring you could say and you know in relation to the rest of tone,0.08018076
in the film I think it is perfect really but yes it is very very,0.055730898
dark this film has got silikal moments and just fits perfectly to kind of the,0.06653602
locations of course well and the way is trying to portray post you know world,0.07060242
or to Vienna and as well just a whole seediness of it I miss portrayed,0.1502999
perfectly you know the atmosphere the tone just free through the visuals of course the,0.053462528
angles and everything the uneasy feel the use of them you know lighting shadows is,0.05627683
perfect you know it's just so good and of course that plays a massive you,0.0632295
know and any actual reveal itself and just it's just wonderful this film you know,0.08324681
the edge and as I've said is perfect and it kind of just this film,0.11294659
just gets better and better and it's just from start to finish one of the,0.08070342
most thrilling films I've ever seen the chase scenes you know it's just it is,0.09570178
perfect in this film he's ever scored by a hands-on class just perfect you know,0.14845024
perfectly suits the action in this film I couldn't think of a more perfect use,0.09188692
of music really for that just the way it builds and builds and it kind,0.07041235
of you know it kind of hard to explain that there's ever instrument of course,0.1027802
kind of it kind of the notes you know kind of sounds almost like tension,0.087237485
in itself and the way that you use them in the action the way you,0.089745894
know that as the you know tempo of the instrument builds so does um you,0.08519662
know works in harmony with the actual the action itself this is so genius you,0.06585775
know the way it builds in certain scenes the chase scenes are all just wonderfully,0.035074975
done and you know the finals of 10 minutes of the film just mind-blowing really,0.107527174
mixed emotions there you know so many emotions I felt but really at the end,0.064503856
of day just just constantly on the edge of my seat and caring about these,0.067107536
characters so much and that's you know great fillers it's not I can't just have,0.05451706
a great feel of really interesting plot you know I never because you never know,0.2423204
care about the characters and it's not Q manatee in the film it's not one,0.064763874
that kind of yeah these characters going along with this film unraveling the mystery behind,0.13621487
something then I'm not you know massively interested and there's never been a I further,0.1179358
really were you know it's not good characters in from but I love where you,0.14873596
could say from most films really in general but yeah I think this one just,0.077062055
perfectly balances out all the elements in that sense and the atmosphere through this film,0.09963192
there's almost a match I think it's just wonderful and so many things I felt,0.09986722
you know as I say the end it really you know the ferris wheel scene,0.24127245
as well of course while one of the best moments cinema probably for me just,0.06037168
amazing and everything leading up to that and then you just cover the way you,0.14960037
know awesome I'll just walks into the scene and of course the actual scene itself,0.110912204
you know which just really it's very contemplative put so many things into perspective and,0.17159344
it's kind of a clash of you know ideals and very shocking at times you,0.31089434
know what the approach you know this Harry lunch council you know what he reveals,0.05548116
initially actually tensions and he's really is the dark nature of his you know personality,0.13071576
and as well though it's just poetic the way is told and the way this,0.030708658
just shows all these people beneath you know the dots as I say and you,0.31089434
know in the relation to the plot now it does get dark you know the,0.062179912
enterprise so a very very shocking actually you know it involves of course penicillin and,0.074550636
stuff like that and racketeering of course which you shouldn't you soon you know find,0.40337408
out you know and really especially once of course a lot most comes into the,0.06783781
film you know there's many many you know reveals there but you know really really,0.04589098
dark and cynical but it really is just too complex for a human film and,0.2412675
in the end you know just just a masterpiece of a film perfect from start,0.072577916
to finish couldn't flora fauna flora because there's nothing wrong and just it goes way,0.09919935
beyond that though you know this is definitely of course if you if you kind,0.1486024
of push this review all of it you know that I love this film it's,0.12992193
being very theistic about it so of course it gets into my hundred percent plus,0.15436216
tears now it goes beyond the tear free actually manages to get 107 plus t2,0.122071736
easily and actually very very close to tier 1 this from you know I think,0.07638227
he's no it's not really comparison but Citizen Kane of course and god tier two,0.08905317
now this is ever so slightly below sis and came from me I prefer Kane,0.15486981
but you know I think both already almost in the level and you know both,0.048208483
are very close to tier 1 something both have something absolute finest from his all-time,0.095616885
you know it's just this film is just it's quite dark moments but it's guys,0.11650355
its comedy its width as charm and the perfect balance of that all the characters,0.095433876
just perfectly you know in terms of the way the design of the the actual,0.05602539
you know the circle the kind of the way it intertwines kind of thing and,0.09711359
you know be billed from the the slow kind of humble beginnings you know and,0.12488108
very very gradual mystery you know it's the kind of peaceful stuff which as I've,0.074537724
gotten you know it's kind of you know Holly Holly Martin's you know just ways,0.3003747
walking around discovering little things came there slowly injects this kind of atmosphere through the,0.106510304
angles perfect placement the least natural the light and friendly shadows and just the kind,0.115804166
of just the way the characters are talking this film you know very very dark,0.07067438
and somber times and as well just how relatable you know Polly Martin's is you,0.13772753
know it's a very very interesting I was a you know a pop western writer,0.10426237
it's kind of not that successful but then it kind of adds to comedy there,0.06730347
as well you know Bernard Lee's character there you know kind of all the scenes,0.0760661
there you know great comedy and this is one of the things just such a,0.06041187
funny film at times but it never goes over the top or anything it's all,0.11661725
very very restrained and kind of dry humor you could say and just the perfect,0.07090889
placement throughout the film of all of the humor but you know in terms of,0.050543178
direction the cinematography editing perfect really and this film just it moved me it just,0.083312266
thrilled me constantly the action is just wonderful some of the best action it's in,0.08779678
a more easily the score by a Karass is just perfect you know zipper score,0.24078852
really really it's beautiful and answers' con men and cornfields to film as well the,0.18120581
ways used especially in the action scenes and the kind of reveals could not be,0.041864228
more you know perfect for this film and just an absolutely flaws from from start,0.06670715
to finish and you know this is a screenplay in this film grain green of,0.06587576
course and of course awesome wells you know the kind of dialogue he added it,0.08558516
in that it's just so so meaningful but it just has such a flow that,0.042243235
script just an ease and combine that with just the ease of the direction you,0.065617904
know in this film by Cal read absolutely masterful direction just perfect and just the,0.06320801
one that yeah it's just all the way to the very end you know it's,0.1430914
just perfect for me I would say that this is as Citizen Kane is just,0.08934223
outside my top 100 films of all time so really lists this nest is absolutely,0.09689902
massive praise I would say it's very very close to my tier 1 and easily,0.06841049
yeah one of the best British films of all time you know there are better,0.073328525
ones definitely and you know it's been compared you know in British films to the,0.05948928
rights of brief encounter the Lawrence of Arabia I don't think it's as good as,0.086107336
in film so there's kind of hints for when I do my David Lean director,0.08563055
series how much I love him and his films especially Lawrence of Arabia yes but,0.089591235
definitely one of the best British films one of the best noir films just one,0.13543843
of the best films in cinema and highly recommend this film this is Studio canal,0.18153185
release and it's the steelbook recommend that just wonderful cinematic perfection and one of my,0.054542568
most loved films of all time so thanks watching my review of Cowell reads absolute,0.08450218
