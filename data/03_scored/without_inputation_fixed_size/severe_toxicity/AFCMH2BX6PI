hey everybody today I'm going to be reviewing of a favorite this film came out,0.07181389
in 2018 it was directed by your ghost Don Tomas this film was a bit,0.06110377
of a departure for Lent the most because it was the first film I think,0.037491746
in his filmography that he did not write himself or or co-write his films tend,0.06904407
to be very heavy on abstractions and the stories themselves and the themes are expressed,0.024487406
a lot through metaphors and such and they aren't very literal and of course he,0.056279857
has typically has a very distinct style of dialogue in his movies where the characters,0.042511888
everything kind of goes against the rulebook where his characters really lack dimension and yet,0.025922207
there's something very appealing about that in terms of the way his films work and,0.030628381
he's exploring humans from the outside and a rather cold sort of sterile way rather,0.17335883
than the more cerebral aspects that were used to the dialogue is very exaggerated very,0.073803455
banal and very awkward highlighting kind of the satirical satirical aspects of social norms and,0.07167553
honestly I know a lot of people think that this film is very different from,0.032427702
the rest of his films and that it is a much more straightforward more literal,0.0650676
story where it is kind of focusing more on the characters and their motivations and,0.0117311785
the more I guess you could say stereotypical way but honestly I think that at,0.017225595
the heart of it everything is so similar even to his films that do have,0.06586249
that more exaggerated more abstract style with the dialogue I think that it easily translates,0.0277488
into this just in a more subtextual sense to me this film still carries a,0.0334461
lot of the signatures and the things that we know and love about Al anthemic,0.01115646
film this film just like his others is studying behavior and contrasting that between this,0.04364669
kind of careful attention to etiquette and artifice and then contrasting that with just brutality,0.2225924
and then idiocy really and using this particular narrative to highlight all of these ideas,0.46571383
all of these themes we were looking at it depicted as a comedy of manners,0.0400833
or kind of an absurdist piece where the humor especially in the screenplay and the,0.1057183
humor just naturally Atlanta Moses works in terms of his vision I think meshed perfectly,0.050820697
and they translate beautifully to screen film is is gorgeous to look at very immersive,0.04632073
in its style a lot of fisheye lenses a lot of wide-angle lenses and deep,0.02379229
focus all of this to create kind of a richness in a depth but also,0.04375977
something that is slightly off so it sort of eases us into the surrealism because,0.053973
there is a bit of surrealism and there are a bit of abstractions in this,0.04845996
film but it's very very subtle it's like the dissonance is like this needle that's,0.023920668
just kind of slowly kind of creeping into the film just ever so slightly it,0.075310096
is exquisite of course the set pieces and the costumes and the lighting and everything,0.045291025
does remind me a lot of Barry Lyndon actually just in terms of the the,0.017797654
cinematography but it is picturesque but I would say also in a way very grotesque,0.07372164
almost gothic and it does help to emphasize that weird contradiction that people have between,0.024607804
this sort of ignorance to the things that are really important the things that are,0.09822368
paramount compared to emphasizing what is gratuitous there is a war going on but you,0.068575114
don't really see any of that at all the opulence and the excess is at,0.023490295
the forefront of the film because that is what is more important to these characters,0.021434877
seemingly there at these elegant parties eating these exquisite hors d'oeuvres and yet they they,0.23580311
aren't talking about the matter at hand the the country's well-being and I like the,0.047951095
flow of this film there's a hypnotic quality to it and you sort of through,0.04192054
that you see the elegance highlighted and contrasted with the violence and a lot of,0.11157857
very kind of cheeky very fun ways like watching Abigail and Anne and they're they're,0.11483797
dancing they're doing some sort of dance but you can hear the gunshots in the,0.021086322
background you see Sarah getting dragged through the dirt by her horse after she's been,0.12316275
poisoned by Abigail and that is contrasted or I should say it's cross cut with,0.16200548
this this naked man inside the palace then they're throwing fruit not him in slow,0.31827837
motion and just laughing I also like that they're emphasizing the personal relationships particularly between,0.0232934
the three women rather than the politics whatever decisions you make in politics tend to,0.038971115
come from things that happen internally and behind closed doors and this film really likes,0.022137312
to show you a bit more of what happens behind closed doors and how it,0.070613235
fuels those external aspects of the the characters but also what is most important is,0.012803455
how what happens behind closed doors is used to manipulate people and to bend others,0.042375524
towards your will this film is about women and all they're very complex shades it's,0.09594941
about their strength and their power but also their their duplicity and their scheming and,0.051420692
even at a certain point really resorting to violence there's an injury to the film,0.044446904
you notice particularly in the clothing but with the women you're seeing how all of,0.08206038
those things that sort of blend into different aspects of the emotional spectrum whether it,0.013235159
is through sex or through love through hate or through deceit sex is a huge,0.4331287
component in the film it is used in a myriad of ways when I look,0.026002029
at the character of Sarah played by Rachel Weisz she is somebody I think that,0.01121167
is very loyal and and very blunt to the Queen but she does it of,0.02885234
course out of love because they've known each other so long so she can be,0.09302593
brutally honest with her when she needs to but I think that there's more to,0.2660646
her she's got a real a real strength to her a real sturdy core innocence,0.06754607
that I think she relishes in having power I think that she likes to be,0.10837106
the one making the decisions and sort of condescending a bit to the queen pampering,0.036344968
the queen really she should probably be the one running things she might she should,0.07427906
be the one who is the queen she is the one quite literally when you,0.029399121
look at the costuming she is the one wearing the pants in the relationship so,0.044838034
to speak but I think even though that she even though she loves the Queen,0.05375748
she does use sex in order to gain that power she uses it as a,0.30847174
way of maintaining her control and her dominance this film is so similar to one,0.04703314
of my favorite Hollywood films of all time it came out in 1950 and that,0.03621659
is the lady eve and abigail played by Emma Stone is Eve essentially this girl,0.0449724
who has fallen on hard times and has clawed her way back to civility and,0.050131567
will do anything she can to obtain regain her her status as a lady she's,0.32263058
indulging the queen in the way that Sarah no longer does she is romanticizing everything,0.0659809
and in a way that maybe the Queen isn't used to hasn't been used to,0.01844022
in a long time and the Queen brilliantly played by Olivia Colman has the most,0.041401695
pivotal role here to me she is absolutely true heart of the film the true,0.024458803
emotion because she is so painfully lonely and pathetic and she is rotting at the,0.6090146
center and is somebody who has lost a lot in her life and it has,0.035065155
caged her it has made her incapable of living especially physically she has like gout,0.3770291
in her legs the food that she's indulging in makes her sick all the time,0.28338873
she's just become this physical manifestation of pain she needs love so desperately and it,0.13940719
is so it is aggressively apparent she's nearly like a child and in the way,0.11173423
that she behaves she needs attention and she can't accept truth or honesty anymore she,0.048692107
doesn't want to accept love in its most real form anymore she wants to address,0.050353736
and package in a more palatable way in the way that abigail is presenting but,0.02454195
she too finds her way to discover her power amidst this triangle between Abigail and,0.095994644
Sara they're fighting for her affection the key of course the symbolic key in this,0.031249663
film being the rabbit of course the rabbits in the film are a huge metaphor,0.016380813
that threads the film's internal I should say emotional logic together as the Queen says,0.047495443
in the movie each rabbit represents the children that she has lost and she's using,0.09025877
them to fill a void that can't be filled Sara recognizes that in her own,0.04234825
way she sees how sad it is how she's using these rabbits to replace something,0.09785184
that cannot be replaced she really refuses to pet the rabbit to acknowledge and acknowledge,0.037544295
them she says no I won't do that it's my Cobb whereas with Abigail Abigail,0.12244169
has that sentiment and that love that nurturing quality to her in terms of the,0.02289296
way that she's caring for the rabbits and that is the key that is what,0.03948996
draws those two together Abigail and and they find that common ground of emotional reason,0.027186055
that Ann left is on to very ignorant Lee and of course eventually things escalate,0.17445971
and Abigail eventually does turn and against her best friend Sarah when I think about,0.046121173
that at first I found that to be a really deeply sad thing and it,0.015388358
is a sad thing don't get me wrong but the more I think about it,0.027262552
especially after seeing it the second time I find that Sarah is the one who,0.024537295
might have the more happy ending here she is the one really when you think,0.051396746
about it who is most free in the end yes is her political power yes,0.025437288
she loses her status and more importantly her best friend but perhaps it will be,0.060300894
a learning experience for her then again maybe not but I do think that she,0.03780039
has a better chance of finding happiness than either of the other two the whole,0.01666019
point of sapphires like these and absurdist comedies like these and you can even say,0.20401049
the same in a way for All About Eve I think that they all reveal,0.017826257
people trying very hard to cover up their flaws with with makeup and fancy clothes,0.074491255
and expensive jewelry that they start to lose themselves and lose their identity yeah I,0.07109616
know that's a very obvious thing to say but it's so easy for that to,0.024676982
become trite because we do see it quite often but with this film I just,0.04735509
think the art direction the embellishments the meson scene everything about it as beautiful as,0.030771395
it is and as alluring as it is it is also like I said something,0.034614827
grotesque about it it works with the characters but it also attracts them there are,0.0511473
many facets within the art design within the dialogue of the characters that makes this,0.009136963
film enticing but ultimately very eerie and haunting final shot is my absolute favorite moment,0.19591588
in the film without question it's definitely the most surrealist the most abstract part of,0.02083089
the film and to me is the closest to what length ammos actually say it's,0.0987505
closer to lent the most as earlier works and his philosophy philosophy for me just,0.05298321
as an artist it's a complicated image but it's a really powerful one it reveals,0.036346965
exactly what I said about Anna not Abigail that they do end up prisoners caged,0.16193031
by their own desires which does eventually cloud their judgment abigail worked so hard to,0.0129364915
finally be seen as a lady again to be a woman of royalty but she,0.04698325
ends up a slave to and wants and needs just as she was before she,0.25187233
is still a slave just this time she's in a palace and deeply unhappy for,0.22442886
me and has the most tragic end of all because she wanted love and she,0.10305424
saw that Romanticism at that nurturing aspect in Abigail but she realizes too late that,0.022355491
Abigail doesn't care about her and sees Abigail squash the little rabbit with her heel,0.22594185
and that's the moment when she realizes that this girl is a and she's somebody,0.1547603
that couldn't be trusted all along but rather than recognize that and sent her away,0.05193355
her loneliness her need for a love kind of again clouds her judgment and she,0.07683137
asserts her dominance as one does to protect themselves and she asks for sex from,0.29423416
her I shouldn't say she asked for it she demands it of her she's trying,0.042103466
so hard to maintain that control and her face in that last moment is absolutely,0.05292201
heartbreaking there is nothing you phoric or sexy and in this climax instead you just,0.13724469
feel her pain and her loneliness and she's more disconnected than ever before and then,0.1500335
Abigail - she has been reduced to the lowest of the low the way that,0.0721824
their face is the way they transpose the faces over one another I think allows,0.13578726
us to see how they are the same they are both prisoners they are the,0.049605407
rabbits that are caged trying to fill their voids with one another and it is,0.08511756
not working they lost themselves in the hunt for something true and even earlier in,0.052116472
the film when abigail first admires the rabbits and says that you know again they,0.022066137
represent the children that she lost and that a little bit of her died with,0.33771008
each child and now all she has is the rabbits seeing all of those rabbits,0.1721615
sort of oval overlap is a very creepy image it's claustrophobic feeling but it completely,0.10427286
works this is a very well-done film I think I think it's one that accentuates,0.03511704
lanta most strengths as well as proving that he has a level of maturity and,0.051735323
slice of textual maturity and I didn't really expect that much from him as he,0.064243436
is deviating a little bit from his comfort zone it's exciting it's exciting to see,0.03659907
I'm a big fan and I look forward to what he does next and that,0.027712882
