hello there welcome to Brian IMAX movie talk and my review of rear-window a film,0.17056592
from 1954 which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock of course and the screenplay was written,0.059728276
by John Michael Hayes now both of these were nominated for Oscars for this film,0.12232266
and both lost quite rightly I think in the case of Hitchcock because yeah my,0.15085776
one of my favorite films of all time won that year on the waterfront and,0.043668523
John Michael Hayes lost out to the country girl yeah exactly who remembers that one,0.2450015
I don't know not me I'll tell you that much alright but both worthy nominees,0.2654751
it must be said now this film is pretty high up in the IMDB top,0.09227888
250 and it is not hard to see why there is not much I can,0.084361486
fault if anything to be honest it follows this character played by Jimmy Stewart who,0.09079135
is again excellent in this film and he's a photographer and he's basically been bound,0.11074835
to a wheelchair due to an accident that's happened so he Wiles his hours away,0.23924764
just looking out the window kind of peering into the lives of his neighbors and,0.15001439
yeah he thinks that he's cutting on to a murder that happened he doesn't necessarily,0.31089434
witness that murder but the things he's seen the behavior patterns he's witnessing leads him,0.19802766
to believe and his girlfriend that a murder has taken place has it Oh hasn't,0.31089434
it film has a lot of fun it must be said of dealing with that,0.060672663
question getting to the bottom of this mystery and I love that we never see,0.09726229
that murder I love that the question of whether he did or he didn't he's,0.2838301
always hanging in the air until we get to these it to the finale to,0.24076402
we find out the the answer to that question we in that sense a pot,0.08236622
into Jimmy Stewart cheers we're going along with this mystery as its unfolding through his,0.06274324
eyes Grace Kelly is also fantastic in this it must be said she won an,0.05652827
Oscar for this she was nominated and she did win and deservedly so I think,0.15829529
yeah really great performance and one of the greatest cinematic kind of introductions for a,0.058766034
character I think the way she comes in out of focus you know she starts,0.09815857
her opening shot she stats out a focus she kind of leans over Jimmy Stewart's,0.31155676
character and again we see it from his eyes very much how this film plays,0.09328121
all the time seeing everything through his eyes and she comes into focus and it's,0.17329654
just yeah she's striking the beautiful clearly but she also proved herself with this film,0.1925442
to be quite a formidable actress quite a talented actress Thelma Ritter is also really,0.065847784
good Stella she's this woman who kind of comes in and does housework the Jim,0.31089434
Stewart's character and yeah she just has a very kind of dry sense of humor,0.109045655
shall we say dry wit and she has this into her character has this interest,0.14137723
in like serial killers the this kind of thing so she brings a little bit,0.4248453
of import to proceedings that is a bit on the more humorous side like I,0.08680301
say very deadpan at the same time yes she just adds another dynamic to this,0.15544856
this core group of characters these two characters screenplay by John Michael Hayes is brilliantly,0.08976349
executed yeah just the way he pulls out particular characters and details and obviously the,0.16123122
way Hitchcock directs that on the screen it's just a beautiful marriage between director and,0.12207783
writer and obviously the actors as well I'm just bringing those details out and and,0.110721745
building up this picture of this world just outside your window yeah you know it's,0.10666798
one of the things that this film is about it's this idea that actually there,0.055378277
is this whole kind of system of life going on just outside your window you,0.11494415
can get caught up in the minutiae of of everyday life and never really notice,0.11091775
what's going on you have all these little stories going on inside these windows and,0.15318038
there are stories that kind of play out in such a way that it acknowledges,0.06861973
the fact you don't have the complete picture you know you can look into someone's,0.14998801
window you can see something happen and you can get the wrong idea you can,0.090860635
build a picture in your head of what is going on in that person's life,0.4032628
and by the time we get to the end of this film we see that,0.069532655
in many of these cases that's not the case you know what you think was,0.08652422
happening or what Jimmy Stewart's character thought was happening isn't the case and I think,0.062114134
that's the way it is with life I think what it is saying ultimately is,0.06528855
that how much do we really know about our neighbors and how much are we,0.054890856
to blame for that you know we don't I think particularly today it's probably never,0.14128348
been more relevant this film because how many of us can truly claim to know,0.05786547
our next-door neighbors you know I think I think a lot of us know people,0.097106606
or within the online community better than we do our own neighbors so yeah I,0.061243176
think that's something that this film taps into long before social media which would probably,0.06491677
existed back then just not to the extent that it does now as with all,0.064766735
Hitchcock films is a pretty good dose of humor in here as well and it,0.118386276
really works it works very well and it's mainly down to Kelly and Stuart and,0.083151855
just they're in to play I totally believe in these characters the way they've brought,0.06621524
them to life and yeah I just really enjoy every moment of this journey going,0.23831083
along with these two people they feel like people I would like to know in,0.10471837
real life you know there's there's nothing about them that kind of makes me shut,0.48127094
down makes me turn enough and there has been in a few of Hitchcock's films,0.32903427
not here like I say they they make these central characters absolutely believable and absolutely,0.104140535
lovable and I think that's very important given the amount of time we're gonna spend,0.06809683
with them because we never really leave that apartment you know everything we see in,0.08314542
the outside world we see from that apartment so yeah you have to make these,0.058765724
guy these characters like especially Stewart's character and they succeed with that something else that,0.10256094
is really great about this film is the production design now that they built all,0.053082854
this block of apartments and many times throughout - you're looking at it you're seeing,0.15253413
the set and you're honestly you forget that you're watching a set this times when,0.06934305
you look at it and you like yeah it looks like location filming and you,0.12934326
have to remind yourself actually no it isn't this was all done studio every last,0.08369396
bit of it was built and it's just brilliant absolutely brilliant and if you look,0.08407366
at behind-the-scenes stuff on this they're the studio where they built this set they actually,0.06005469
took out the middle floor just so they could get that depth you know so,0.10040558
they could get like two or three floors worth of building on there so yeah,0.119115576
it is it is an amazing feat it must be said and the physicality of,0.11087919
it you know like these days you do something like this you probably employ CGI,0.101816826
you know to you need to kind of you get a little bit of the,0.1503974
stage and then you'd map the rest out with with computer graphics build it up,0.09729016
so to speak but here it's all real there's no green screen in that regard,0.06970278
and you just yeah you can feel it you feel like you can reach out,0.09995916
touch it and live with these people all these people that you're seeing in these,0.15184388
apartment blocks he's absolutely brilliant Hitchcock's direction is brilliant the way he like I said,0.105162084
the way he moves the camera across these blocks kind of focuses in on very,0.08269129
specific information giving us what we need to know just enough to keep us on,0.065603144
tenterhooks to keep us gripped with what's going on never knowing all the facts but,0.07063511
just enough to keep sucking in so yeah if there's one downside and this is,0.8060606
very minimal really it is it's it's towards the end of the film and it's,0.060492568
the final confrontation between Jimmy Stewart's character and this guy it doesn't really play all,0.07578436
that well or believable these days you know Stewart uses his carrot his camera should,0.17431913
say the flash on his camera to kind of yeah push this guy back every,0.23769088
now and then just like phase in it's just to hold off his attack really,0.21441221
and the amount of times the sky falls for him without just saying you know,0.088045575
I'm going to close my eyes and come for you you're in a wheelchair how,0.4849585
you know how difficult is it going to be to subdue you yeah that doesn't,0.10098337
play too well by modern standards but like I say it's such a minor criticism,0.07691198
I I'm literally struggling there to to come up with that just so I've got,0.06327031
something to criticize neither not i thing you have to quit if somebody wanted to,0.12324992
yeah that's a little thing but for the most part I can understand why this,0.058439694
film is so loved by people it's still not my favorite film of 1954 I've,0.14938912
got to say upon the waterfront I love so much but yeah this definitely definitely,0.06397122
comes a very close second so yeah rear window I give it a 5 out,0.40317002
5 III think it's yeah really incredible piece of work and I strongly urge anyone,0.15108643
who hasn't seen it to go out and see it if you have seen rear,0.2400222
window then as usual I would like to know what you thought about it comment,0.078925595
