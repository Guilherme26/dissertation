from [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so let's see now if this movie is worth all the hype my name is Brendan Keith Avery and this is just my opinion hey what's going on everyone thank you so much for tuning into my appearance lash review for a star is born I really do appreciate it now this family stars born is a remake of the 1937 original film of the same name which I have not seen and actually this is the fourth film that is being remade by the same title the interesting thing is the past three film was one of the main protagonists in the film which Bradley Cooper is playing in this new age one in 2018 his name was Norman but in this film here his name is Jack so that's one of the differences that I noticed when I was trying to look up some information and Bradley Cooper is the writer and director of this film this is also his directorial debut and I'll just go ahead and say that he did a damn good job you know he actually said in the past that he wanted to get into directing before acting but sometimes things just don't work out the way that we planned but you know of course he's a great actor and I can now say that he is a great director at least based on this film now there has been a lot of buzz with this film right here it debuted at a I think it was the Venice Film Festival earlier this year in August 13 August 31st of this year after the film play after it finished you know they got a Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga they got a standing ovation for about eight minutes and there's been so much Oscar buzz around this film to saying you know how great the performances is and you know all that good stuff and it is gonna get some occur Oscar recognition and I will go ahead and say that I do agree with that I'm just going to say that this is a fantastic film it's a beautiful film I would be pretty surprised if it did not get any type of Oscar nom nominations or even win but why not only because it's a great story but we have some great performances by both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga herself now I am not necessarily a little Gaga fan I don't have anything against her but I can say that after watching this movie right here I am a fan of Lady gaga I mean she did a great job singing on stage on screen and she did a great job performing and this movie right here is going to make me want to pay attention to her work going on now in the future but like why is this movie good to me why is it so great like I said it's a great story is full of passion and emotions and I'm just really fond of like where the film focused what it's about is Bradley Cooper's character Jack he is a seasoned music musician he has some alcohol and drug problems that he's dealing with you know but he's still you know a fantastic musician and you know just by you know going around the block or by look or however you want to say it he runs into Lady Gaga's character by the name of Allie and you know he just sees something in her and just once her to reach these these Heights you know he wants her to reach these goals of being you know the best new songwriter slash musician and he's just kind of helping her along the way now this feeling might here could have copied on a lot of the cliche tropes you know three-act structure of a film to where you know you see the rise in the fall of you know a said actor actress or you know performer musician or something like that and how it focuses on you know how they try to you know go into the media and try to cater to everyone and become like the next best pop star and things like that and how it turns them down you know on the inside out and things like that know this film didn't really focus on that at all what it focused on was the characters themselves and their relationship and you know just kind of how they dealt with things and I was just about to give us full up but I don't I don't want to do that but you know the song choices in this family here are just beautiful I mean they really had a lot of weight to them and meaning and you felt it when you know they were singing on stage and Lady Gaga also said in the past interview that she is tired of looking at movies to where the actors or actresses are trying to pretend and live synch with the real songs and they really just don't do a great job there and of course she would have a great eye because she is a real life you know recording artist so she kind of knows her stuff she knows her lane as far as that's concerned so her I'm Bradley Cooper did get together and practice singing live on stage you know off camera and on camera and you know that practice paid off because they just made a great duet on screen on stage and you know I just thought it was really fantastic Bradley Cooper also say to himself in a couple of many views that he took singing for granted because he just really did not know how are difficult it was but he did take some voice acting not voice acting but voice lessons just to you know really hit the nail down center home you know to give a great performance but you know like I said the film didn't focus on all that extra crap it really focused on their relationships and the demons that they have to deal with and you know when we're with me a regular consumer a regular person or whatever one we see Beyonce or little Wayne or Lady Gaga or whoever the hell that is performing whether they're on the movie screen the TV show or recording artists or whatever we kind of put them on a pedestal that they're just like the perfect being and they have their life together and just there's nothing wrong and they just wake up every day freshly bathed don't even have to wipe under their arms and put on deodorant and this is everything is just you know great and wonderful for them but no this film right here kind of just takes it gives you a different perspective of their life and just kind of shows you you know everything that you know these normal people you know have to deal with there was even a couple of scenes to where you know like it's kind of rude to wear when you see a celebrity you kind of just jump off in their face like hey can I take a picture kind of like a picture that Yatta Yatta me and then you know like they just want to eat their hamburger on fire - or wood or whatever you know I'm saying like everybody else they don't want to be bothered and the film kind of dealt with it and I like the way that they dealt with him I kind of said that back to back another thing that was just kind of fascinating to me is just like their relationship and you know just kind of how they handle this certain situation that you know they had to go through and like different hardships and things like that and one of the things that spoke to me the most when I was watching this film is in something that I can relate to something that I did we're going up as always wrong about what other people think of you and that you shouldn't do that it's just really none of your business you know do your thing don't worry about what other people think and if you really have if you truly really just have somebody that's down for you like a down-ass chick or down as dude or whatever you know I'm saying that just has your back no matter what there's your support system right there that's all you have to worry about as far as somebody worrying about you all that other stuff is just you know random noise that you can you know just let go through one ear and out the other and you know this film really put that on the forefront but it was a beautiful film great performances great acting great singing great passion great emotion I didn't tear up or anything like that when I was watching it but I can hear all those sniffles and you know runny noses and all that when the theater when I was watching other people just getting really emotional and so I really do recommend you see this film is like I said it's fantastic it's just the beautiful film on so many levels and I would really be surprised if it did not get any type of Oscar attention if I had the rate of stars born out of a 1 out of 10 I will give this a nine point five out of 10 yes a nine point five out of 10 but guys that is just my opinion have you seen the stars born or do you want to see it have I turned you on how about turned you off do you agree with me or do you disagree with
