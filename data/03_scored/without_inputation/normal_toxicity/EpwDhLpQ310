I'm not gonna give anything special away,0.16529875
okay because I want to make sure that you go into this movie the same way,0.24187109
I did nothing was spoil for me,0.11513054
I didn't read any too many reviews I didn't watch too many trailers or the scenes from the film,0.060804497
so I want to make sure that I don't spoil that for you as well so you don't have to like click away it's okay,0.14951065
I'm not gonna tell you anything about the plot of the movie okay,0.17609455
so also before I get started I want to make,0.084889635
sure that I give a special,0.07135307
thank you to mr.,0.0475647
design junkie who helped create this backdrop for me for my review video you may know him from all of the amazing fan art that he's had for black panther make sure that you go follow him on Twitter and Instagram because his work is absolutely amazing,0.31603485
so getting into Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler and I absolutely loved this film I was shocked that I love this one because I actually got scared before I went to go see it because when the embargo lifted and all the reviews came out,0.09011402
I was like,0.039237767
yeah like I know this movie's gonna be great,0.10843445
but I felt like it was a little bit over height and I was scared because my level of excitement was even higher because of how good the reviews were,0.07157256
so I didn't want to feel like I was setting myself up for failure,0.086209886
if the reviews completely overhyped the film but I will have to tell you that the movie is very very good,0.052926537
it definitely is a different type of Marvel film than what you're used to seeing,0.14383067
and I actually appreciate that now first and foremost the casting for this film is simply amazing,0.06092792
the casting for this film is so good,0.08151886
and the character development of the majority of the cast is so amazing that sometimes you forget that there's a movie is about to chawla okay because you have all these different story arcs from the other characters and they're just as entertaining to watch on the screen that you kind of forget like oh yeah like I'm in a Black Panther movie so I thought the casting decisions were absolutely amazing for this film now I have to talk about the female presence of this movie and it's for a different reason,0.09198639
now a lot of people talked about the door of menagerie and they're basically in this badass all-female army that protects the king but I really want to talk about the diversity of female empowerment from the different types of characters because not only do you have the general of the dorm Elisha who is this badass woman,0.43890908
she was one of my favorite characters to watching the action sequences but you also have someone like Nakia who is kind of like an independent rebel who fights for her country just in a different way than what you see the dorm lij I'm do,0.095413074
and then you have two childless little sisters sharee who is definitely gonna be the fan favorite,0.0805438
she was my favorite in the entire movie not only is she absolutely hilarious in the film but she's a 16 year old genius not only is she a 16 year old genius,0.26367322
she isn't the smartest person on the planet,0.46211794
yes,0.036876976
she is smarter than Toni start,0.2931765
and she is responsible for the some of the technological advances that what kind of continues to have,0.087810926
so I really like the different types of female characters that you see it was really refreshing not only just to get the strong warrior-type but to get the highly intelligent woman as well or the independent kind of spy type of female,0.20934291
so I really appreciated that and especially as a black woman seeing all these different types of black women who were basically just as important to the film as Black Panther himself,0.10030342
it was really great to see now we have talked about this villain okay because when y'all started talk about this villain y'all were like this is the best villain that I've ever seen that was just like,0.12464491
okay,0.050967902
yeah,0.040847696
it's not like it was gonna be that hard to do that because the villains are and issue in these types of films but I absolutely enjoy,0.11092774
Michael B Jordan and yes I said Michael B Jordan because he was looking like a little snack okay after you didn't lost ten pounds and you want to reward your suffer at that cheat meal that was Michael Bay Jordan this kill monger,0.5154597
okay,0.050967902
yes,0.036876976
he was getting it in a movie but back to him being a good villain I enjoy kill monger now a lot of people compare him to Loki saying the best villain says Loki but for me I'm gonna compare him closer to a vulture just because I feel as though would both of their storylines,0.6638418
I felt as though because of their circumstances of what happened to them,0.0983201
you kind of sympathize with them as a character,0.1757255
and then you almost felt like well yo given given the same circumstances that she went through I would too and I was okay with that and will kill monger is even is his circumstances are hiding to where not only do you sympathize for his character,0.38330165
but because he was speaking so much truth in this film like he will be talking,0.15059493
I'd be like,0.05422457
yep message okay cuz,0.0901369
he didn't tell no lies,0.19172728
he told that one lie in this film and it was hard because you know that this is a hero film but it's kind of just like I was okay either way,0.2061027
I was like if if the hero wins I'm okay but if the villain lives I'm a little too because he was speaking of truth,0.1548216
and so I think that's why a lot of people enjoyed his character because he had character development and because the backstory of how his life turned into that direction,0.0977956
I think it really set him up to be a very good villain but he was also funny too,0.17142946
he was funny,0.10187394
yeah like he was saved me he would be serious but it would be funny,0.20117152
and that kind of leads me to another thing that I liked about this film the jokes the movie was funny at the right times,0.08342581
and I think as a black person because I felt as though it was like black jokes it was junk,0.7318331
so like black people will get cuz,0.5760252
it's like something that a black person will predominantly say to another black person which made it even more hilarious,0.69542736
and that's not to say that if you're not black that you're not gonna get the jokes you're definitely gonna get and they're gonna be funny whoever watches it,0.6057695
but I just think it's a black person just given the context of the jokes it made it even funnier even made it even more funny for me,0.53490317
so I thought that the movie knew when to take yourself seriously in a new one to lighten up the mood,0.11104073
but it wasn't in a cheesy way it's so natural,0.10783308
and because the movie felt so natural it didn't feel like a superhero movie and I think that's because of the real-life topics that they talked about they definitely talked about imperialism colonialism they talked about immigration this is there's this battle of what do you do intervene with another country to try to you know help them do better you know,0.07392616
and I feel like a lot of the issues that were talking about are relatable to the issues that we talked about as a country today,0.03413322
and I appreciate it that they did not try to like sugarcoat it they called it what it was it wasn't preachy preachy,0.07035354
it was done just right,0.065394
and I appreciate it being,0.054756377
so real which made it such a relatable film it's like they,0.12049921
it's a superhero film,0.15540592
but it's not doesn't feel that way,0.081679516
I definitely agree with the comparisons that this is a Bond film made like the political thriller,0.09457042
yes now as much as I love this movie there were a few just a few issues,0.10605525
now a lot of people talk about the CG with the extra scenes,0.089483395
I didn't have an issue with majority of the action scenes I only had an issue with the one with the two Panthers,0.05027826
and I didn't like the music that was paired with it,0.071017705
that's really nitpicking it really wasn't necessary to say,0.08534533
but that was an issue for me as well as a little bit of the pasty some of the parts of the beginning felt a little bit like too long but overall as a film pacing wise I didn't feel like I was in a two hour and 14 minutes which was a good thing I just felt like there were a couple of parts in the beginning that they didn't need to dwell on as much,0.051197335
but for me I love this movie I really love this movie I love that this movie is dispelling the myths that are predominantly black cast with positive black characters can't do well in the box office and we see that from what it's doing with the presale tickets,0.14359368
I love is of the beautiful presence of like women like doing the damn thing and in a positive way I just love this movie so much I'm so happy they were continued,0.6152442
this is not just the first black superhero film it's the first predominantly black cast with a Marvel movie but we had movies like companies like Blankman,0.14974332
we had meteor man we had spawn we had blade like we had a lot of movies but I love that this movie is getting so much height that we can continue to make other movies like this and even continue it out into different genres,0.19101073
I love this film I'm so happy that I got to see this early I can't wait to go see it again on Monday and give you a more in-depth look on my thoughts about this film,0.15306215
but I'm gonna leave it right,0.1093623
