you would think that after three versions three high-profile versions of this exact same story,0.06699917
well actually Bradley Cooper has made a significant change which we'll discuss in just a,0.038490955
moment but anyway you would think at this point there wouldn't be any magic left,0.101323366
in this story but you would be wrong and what makes this version of a,0.10817462
stars born truly shine is the following first off a movie star truly is being,0.06022157
born here with Lady gaga you know Bradley Cooper kind of short changes are within,0.31089434
the movie but I think he makes up for it by giving her you know,0.11560568
like setting her on her way as a movie star right if you I mean,0.25092646
the movie focuses more on Bradley Cooper which might disappoint some Lady Gaga fans but,0.10437053
little monsters if you've come to worship at the altar of Gaga don't worry you'll,0.476961
get in a lot of praying you'll have you'll have your religious experience watching this,0.09245895
movie then ask for Cooper he's definitely given himself the role of his career the,0.06496732
sound design is really really good I mean I know it's a movie about the,0.071467035
music industry but I didn't expect the sound to be that good very very good,0.052221403
make sure you buy tickets for a theater that has a very good sound system,0.06144283
the press screening was anna dolby atmos made a difference that also finally it's a,0.052054446
sophisticated realistic depiction shockingly realistic and sophisticated actually of what it means to be a,0.064884685
successful artist particularly in the music business today now speaking of Cooper what did he,0.05297835
do what did he do well as the director co-writer and one of the film's,0.043033134
producers for the first time ever in this story the older male role is made,0.07819378
to be extremely sympathetic in the past he's been under the character's unsympathetic villified almost,0.109759234
even and is really horrible in his treatment of the young female ingenue right and,0.31963232
also in the past his character who's been a husband you know his career is,0.07561908
really on the rocks but here Bradley Cooper's career is actually in pretty good shape,0.113895826
and he things never really get that bad to be honest with you and so,0.15458722
the reason I'm bringing this up at the front of the review is that it,0.06128538
makes a huge difference in the movie and the movie as I said actually leans,0.05818949
more towards Cooper than it does Gaga when in the past the female character has,0.10133681
really been the focus and also even more so because this is still a very,0.022794537
sad story bring tissues someone asked me how many tissue should I bring the whole,0.10978781
box but so well you might also get a little bit annoyed particularly if you're,0.14222448
a Gaga fan but between the two people someone's got to look worse than the,0.1531647
other one and since Cooper is practically playing a Christ figure Gaga comes off as,0.11108512
John grateful and uncaring especially in the third act I actually thought uncharacteristically so for,0.06641374
how kind her character was in the beginning in the moment so yeah basically what,0.07111241
you have here is that Bradley Cooper and taken no chances that someone else is,0.108611576
gonna win an Oscar for his movie okay he is definitely stacked the dick I,0.8785311
also have to say that the movie is way too long and the problem there,0.06931461
is that it feels too long right and it could easily lose half an hour,0.06043073
easily lose half an hour but thankfully there are such brilliant moments throughout like breadcrumbs,0.075732335
right combined with powerhouse performances you're still kept engaged in the core of the film,0.085432075
naturally is Cooper and Gaga's relationship which seems so deep and so real that it's,0.07324536
a credit to both actors and also Cooper's directing of the scenes it's really good,0.058203403
stuff now Cooper is doing a mean Sam Elliott impression and Sam Elliott by the,0.044658013
way is in the movie playing his brother and there's even a commentary on the,0.08109648
fact that Bradley Cooper's doing a Sam Elliott impression yeah Cooper brings vulnerability and kindness,0.080378145
to the role and he ultimately moves it beyond just being a Sam Elliott impression,0.029339716
and he breaks your heart again unless you're Lady Gaga fan and you're like want,0.16911569
you to go Gaga but he his character I thought was just so charming but,0.11184672
also speaking of breaking your heart he also delivers an incredibly convincing and realistic portrayal,0.15052095
of an addict not just the behavior but the motivations to do such things and,0.152781
also the repercussions of the whole situation really interesting then with gaga all right so,0.1547009
she starts out on her only false note in the movie and I feel of,0.21081719
Cooper was a little more protective of her he would have you would have changed,0.09723251
the scene and it's a short scene clearly written by a group of men three,0.266126
men wrote this screenplay for a woman because any woman will tell you that we,0.23252326
don't go into the ladies room and scream amen we just don't do it we,0.18775176
might be thinking it sometimes we don't really verbalize it like that it just rang,0.079956606
false but for the rest of the film she is luminous and you know what,0.1808785
I enjoyed the most about her performance not the singing watching her character think that,0.15684792
was really cool particularly in the early stages of her relationship with Cooper when I,0.08822146
guess the focus was a little bit more on her to some degree but she,0.18523565
was trying to figure out the enigmatic celebrity sitting across from her why is he,0.09336569
talking to me what does he want right we'll talk about that at the end,0.08505346
but then also the added layer of difficulty that she's dealing with somebody who's drunk,0.31089434
you know and also not only that that's tough to do but how she feels,0.11586032
about it you know that's a that's a lot to take on and it's a,0.082616806
risky road to go down but I think to her character's credit she goes down,0.10383424
it with her eyes wide open so I thought that was all great and that,0.1391733
all came from Lady Gaga's performance also I have to add when her character starts,0.06978332
to mimic Gaga's actual music career and those of her peers in the music business,0.09615563
you know in this I'd say maybe the second half of the movie right you,0.09800363
can tell that the commentary which is not flattering uh-huh skirts a little too close,0.1489951
to home for gaga and I think she's made a little uncomfortable by being asked,0.17919865
to to be the face of that commentary right and I think she isn't quite,0.2707389
sure how to play it either which makes the second half of the movie not,0.05620054
not as strong for her as the first that is for the music I'm not,0.1059619
a big music person but I will say that I was impressed because you know,0.11066385
get a more into story and and movie movie making and stuff like that so,0.07181919
impressed me the most music wise was Cooper's ability to capture the feeling of being,0.07696114
in a concert right both in the audience and also backstage and not just backstage,0.05406303
from having VIP access that was done very well you were like oh let's go,0.105812185
this is gonna be so great like when she goes to his first concert he,0.1111381
invites her there's like almost like a Cinderella type feel to it it was really,0.06784562
really cool and then after that sound design as I said the press screening was,0.027901527
an Adobe Atmos theater and for some moments my seat actually throbbed from the music,0.096411966
it was really cool you felt like you not only were at a concert but,0.13990478
you had want the best seat in the house as for the actual singing though,0.063500956
I like shallow quite a bit I don't see how anyone could not like shallow,0.17835692
it's a very good song and also Gaga's chabuk charming performance at the drag bar,0.07778655
and also the scene that follows that backstage between her and Cooper that kind of,0.103428505
like makes for a great package but otherwise I thought the music wasn't particularly distinct,0.07917365
it's not like greatest showmen like for me at least I wouldn't I wasn't like,0.2925495
I must buy the soundtrack I was like I'm are they so I mean they,0.06362069
also don't seem particularly original you know so you're like is this like a song,0.2585165
someone else's song I don't know uh although there's also I have to say one,0.08475557
song that she sings that's supposed to be bad and oh boy is it a,0.31115028
stinker it was awful and like and I think that's part of why she was,0.6700124
like uh you know I have to see these people in the music business Bradley,0.23435281
when I go back you know I'm still kind of in both I have a,0.060524568
foot in both places so they're gonna be like with the creature you saying something,0.21476352
about me when you did that performance right like I don't know it was it,0.15059817
was awkward okay but I have to say also as impressive as Cooper's acting is,0.10055645
I dare say his directing is even more impressive he not only does the story,0.118189506
justice but it's able to package it in a way that indeed elevates it to,0.07676546
awards caliber material I mean oh I've always said to you that you know directors,0.16771218
they have a responsibility to present something as awards worthy like this is special pay,0.065646276
attention this is a film for the ages and I think Cooper very much does,0.06840099
that maybe that's why you made it too long I think someone should have been,0.08173847
like perfect it's a real challenge though at the awards situation though because this is,0.05629368
the fourth telling of the story and the three previous ones were all major awards,0.05089974
contenders but despite a slew of nominations no version is ever won a major Oscar,0.07921616
one of the major categories I think the highest has ever gone is screenplay and,0.062889636
while I feel that shallow is a shoo-in for Best Original Song I'll certainly be,0.12228134
nominated so Gaga and Perkin sing at the Oscars right but I'm curious to see,0.064585865
if Cooper's version can go beyond nominations and finally bring home some gold in a,0.046900038
meaningful way it's certainly his intention to either get director or actor right now though,0.06432871
I don't think think we have a good enough feel for the playing field so,0.058668487
we'll have to wait and see how it shapes up finally and I this is,0.038174964
this is tough but it was struck me so much while watching the movie I,0.11770944
wanted to discuss it here I have I have to comment on the me2 aspect,0.12738991
to the film which haha which highlights why the me2 movement has sent the entertainment,0.06158026
business particularly hard and that's because there's often absolutely no line between professional and personal,0.1020381
and it's a bit uncomfortable especially because of what's what's being discussed and what's happening,0.09348311
today right to watch their first night together as under the circumstances a very different,0.058839463
movie could easily have her claim years later that she wasn't willing to sleep with,0.14891988
him he wouldn't have helped her career and that's the case that's clearly the case,0.08708549
that would be a correct accusation in this situation and I'm not saying the Cooper's,0.047300104
character is vilified here by any means that just happens to be his motivation if,0.059645493
he didn't think she was hot he would not have helped her if he wasn't,0.32265556
interested in her physically you know and you know it turns out here fortunately there,0.1975955
was a romantic aspect to it as well but there often isn't right but I,0.0823159
think because of that the scene actually does an amazing job of showing how grey,0.23998575
perhaps too gray the entertainment entertainment business is instead of black and white when it,0.13065214
comes to professional versus personal it's like I would say that this is like again,0.07855315
has a Cinderella type quality to it points but like 99% of the time it,0.051856417
doesn't turn out like this so I would I would hate to think that this,0.11981493
would kind of romanticize something that it should not so just make sure that you,0.1816831
know just like Lady Gaga's character goes into the relationship with her eyes open you,0.098070316
know make sure that you're really aware of what's going on in someone's intentions it's,0.11097471
it's complicated but that's good I think I think the movie is it's complex but,0.06681853
I think there might have to be some commentary on that and if there's if,0.0654157
there's anything that could potentially undercut this for award season it might be that the,0.03235281
potential romanticizing of that aspect but anyway that's my review of a star is born,0.095776476
I'm very curious to hear your thoughts down below save those spoiler comments though for,0.10508578
the spoiler review you know those are for those who aren't familiar with the star,0.081948385
is born' story you don't want to ruin it for them right and then of,0.1697625
