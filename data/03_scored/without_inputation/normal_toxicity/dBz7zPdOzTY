hey everybody Christina here for Cinna fix I went and saw Pixar's new movie inside,0.13969536
out a little early and I'm gonna tell you how it was first off I'm,0.09328306
guessing if you're thinking about seeing inside out there's really two things you want to,0.087173745
know how it ranks and the greater Pixar hierarchy and how many times its gonna,0.06419298
make you cry to answer the first question it's at least a solid ratatouille maybe,0.18592073
better pretty pretty darn good to even really great as for the crying question I,0.37664166
missed it up twice and got a little lump in my throat once but no,0.2546616
actual tears there were tons of things I loved about this movie the voice acting,0.110716894
was really great especially Phyllis Smith as sadness and Lewis Black his anger was just,0.11218175
like the most perfectly cast actor in the history of cinema the animation to go,0.06670722
with them was great it was spot-on and it was constantly clever and surprising the,0.21693254
world was really rich and well imagined the the representation of the workings of a,0.043524098
person's mind were we're really cool and surprising and there was always something kind of,0.08255237
new that you were like oh that's right that makes sense overall I'm gonna try,0.18934022
to keep this review pretty vague cuz I went into it knowing almost nothing more,0.18130724
than what you see in the trailers and I think a lot of other people,0.11117925
want to do that too so I'm gonna try to talk around any actual plot,0.11418261
points but I am gonna talk about a few of the things that were in,0.06474996
the trailers and if you somehow deliberately avoided the trailers then why are you watching,0.028219147
this review hit watch later come back go on go the movie centers around the,0.26138452
emotions of Riley who's an 11 year old girl and well she's dealing with some,0.3191162
things and so are her emotions as Riley deals with those things two of her,0.056790143
emotions joy and sadness get lost in the long-term memory section of her Riley's mind,0.16477124
and they have to deal with each other so the folks at Pixar this is,0.08105005
this is the sort of thing they do they communicate abstract mechanics of a person's,0.18676087
psyche in a really fun clever visual way so that that's a delight and you,0.17966771
know the more you like that the more you'll like the movie as a whole,0.10086384
that said I would personally probably trade a few of those really clever moments for,0.09276354
a little bit more character development about the relationship between joy and sadness it's clear,0.08551847
that these two characters have a have a conflict with each other but it's it's,0.099317774
all a little bit surface which kind of makes sense because they're one emotion characters,0.12694803
but you know it would have been nice to explore that a little bit deeper,0.13854057
overall the landscape of Riley's mind reminds me a lot of the spaceship scenes and,0.07328834
wall-e and the scenes at Paradise Falls and up Pixar creates these like really amazing,0.10116511
well imagined worlds but I found in talking to a lot of friends that they're,0.06366822
very divisive like wall-e and up sort of lost a lot of people when the,0.16198419
dogs started talking and flying airplanes or when it's all fat humans in wheelchairs under,0.53663534
their robot overlords and I think that the setting of inside out might have had,0.120012894
a slightly similar effect on me like I didn't entirely emotionally connect with this world,0.0851513
because while I was delighted to discover it it didn't necessarily feel real the way,0.030297915
Carl and Ellie not being able to have a kid and up did inside out,0.21354234
also didn't benefit from the amazing like first 10 to 20 minutes that wall-e and,0.08543146
up both had so your mileage on connecting to this world may vary I ended,0.14021806
up seeing inside out alone just due to hazards of scheduling so I missed out,0.1011587
on the chance to see if somebody else had connected with the world in a,0.08151281
different way than I had I think that there's a really good chance that people,0.07681106
will like this movie more than I did but I don't think there are that,0.0647359
many people who are going to like it less than I did unless they you,0.15444116
know hate cartoons in which case I don't think you were planning to see this,0.29511452
anyway so all in all if you're interested in seeing inside out you should definitely,0.15460697
see it I think that it's a really solid effort by Pixar not it's best,0.083414145
not its worst but you might have a little bit of you might have a,0.2412397
similar experience as I did which is I don't quite feel as connected to these,0.0800211
characters as I have with other characters in me and Pixar universe one small caveat,0.028900206
if you happen to be going with a kid between the ages of like I,0.24058293
don't know four and six there are some representations in Riley's mind of things that,0.058485992
that scared her as a little kid that are brought back and like cartoonishly over-the-top,0.16593955
funny hilarious ways but so anyone over the age of eight will be able to,0.10107802
laugh at those moments but if you're dealing with like a much more literal minded,0.24254917
small small child you might be dealing with a little bit of Nightmare fuel so,0.24696884
just keep that in mind overall I think this is Pixar's best movie since Toy,0.14191157
Story 3 in that like it definitely is better than brave and monsters University but,0.19591413
it's not in my personal top five Pixar movies although like I said it might,0.18059596
be in yours so you should definitely check it out and find out where it,0.10110774
stands up for you so that's what I thought of inside out but I want,0.17964987
to hear what you think are you gonna go see it have you seen it,0.077634215
already what did you think what did you think of the the crazy psyche landscape,0.4542262
that the Pixar folks imagined up remember to like and subscribe and come back next,0.0691819
time for more movie news and reviews are in cinah fix now joy brings a,0.044454273
