hello everybody today I'm going to be reviewing Logan directed by James Mangold as you,0.12234191
may have heard this is Hugh Jackman's last time playing the grizzly chiseled comic book,0.11860956
character Wolverine and as his last outing he and Matt gold together they both decided,0.030325722
they wanted to have a different take on the x-men Wolverine canon with this villain,0.14319275
they took a really bold risk here I think because this is not like a,0.016831141
typical superhero movie at all and I don't mean that it takes risks in terms,0.022516467
of the narrative because there's it's very familiar there's nothing there that we haven't seen,0.017127814
before in terms of the narrative but it's more in the execution of it the,0.050693646
style of the film that really stands out to me and I think that it,0.025585623
really paid off this film is like a rusty pipe of a villain it's very,0.22962706
gritty it's extremely violent and it feels very warm you feel every stab in the,0.24880956
film the sting of all of the wounds it's very physical a physical film and,0.06285254
it's nothing like a lot of those glossy cgi more soulless true superhero films that,0.06633212
we've grown so accustomed accustomed to seeing in the past and I find that refreshing,0.013105448
quite honestly I think that this is a film with soul it has a moral,0.049113836
compass and it tries to strip away all of those more obvious tropes the film,0.12860261
starts with a brawl between Wolverine and several men and Wolverine gets knocked to the,0.14647079
ground while he's on the ground the camera is right next to him and you,0.10499258
see in the corner of the frame Logan the name of the film and I,0.01633957
feel like that image you know with the title of the film in it is,0.01045203
a perfect metaphor for so much of what the film is is about what it's,0.016573716
trying to say that this is not about Logan in his in his prime this,0.03321395
is about a man who is growing much older who is being beaten down offense,0.17398544
he's very weary and hurting both mentally and physically realizing that mortality is starting to,0.26203552
eat away at him quite literally the film takes place in 2029 I believe and,0.09218381
it's a far more cynical world very kind of dystopian that really reflects a lot,0.083350174
of the social consciousness the darkness that we're experiencing right now Logan is caring for,0.011055352
Charles Xavier of course the professor Eck's and he also was very very old and,0.0637093
he keeps trying to lose his mind they both come across a young girl who,0.23826386
is a mutant that is being pursued by the antagonist the film this these corporate,0.06253724
forces who want to turn her into a weapon so I said it's a familiar,0.25942507
story this is nothing we haven't seen before but she is that representation of the,0.021808045
next generation they'd be the youth that could use her power for good it's a,0.01887525
chase movie basically and I think that it's something that the director men gold is,0.01849011
very comfortable directing I mean we've seen him do films like that in the past,0.03496205
he's a very classical director he likes to kind of borrow from lots of genre,0.048912283
pieces of the past I mean we saw that in his remake for 3:10 to,0.04677771
Yuma which I thought was a really solid movie there are a lot of kind,0.08351647
of callbacks to a lot of those nostalgic narratives that you see echo in this,0.02073976
film morally visually there are call out to films like Shane which is of course,0.035217483
a classic film as well and that someone really helps to shape the symbolism and,0.03725494
the themes in this one this would be kind of reminds me of the Last,0.01905352
of Us which is a video game but I think it could have easily been,0.027781395
a film as well they're both similar stories similar ideas in terms of the tone,0.016993446
but Naughty Dog's a company who made that film well art started this video game,0.18302594
they wanted to make a game that was different from games we had seen in,0.024037076
the past they wanted it to be a more cinematic experience one that really draw,0.01763934
on emotion so they really tried to develop great complex characters that you're playing and,0.014855546
there's a real ensemble and I think that this movie does the same thing in,0.027604457
a lot of ways it takes a genre that in my opinion has become very,0.041687723
stale and increasingly more uninteresting as time goes on but if instead it's doing something,0.05278964
more bold I think it's stripping back the story and focusing much more on the,0.035969805
pay so we see the characters arcs and we get to see them explored much,0.031516403
more than we have in any of the other x-men films that I've seen at,0.06371328
least yeah it does resort to certain cliches here and there that I think that,0.04839477
some could have done without but overall I was I was very convinced by it,0.033923037
I know I have criticized superhero films in the past I have talked about how,0.027376963
I think that they are too literal and too realistic and they sacrifice a lot,0.1292658
of their artfulness in the fantasy aspect of what makes a comic book film or,0.051990755
sorry a comic book or a graphic novel so special but I actually think it,0.034886885
works in this instance because of how well they sell it it takes the gloves,0.041499477
off and goes all in to the point it doesn't even feel like a comic-book,0.06424144
movie at all I think that somebody could just walk in and see this and,0.043677952
they probably wouldn't really need much context I mean it even includes the x-men comic,0.10308152
book within the movie at kind of a fable to contract that fantasy from reality,0.05226614
so we can look at the situation and see that it's very separate from what,0.011907453
people believe the idealism of it all and it really does succeed in terms of,0.023641957
just being a dramatic work because of the the core themes of the story they're,0.022932872
very intact they're very resonant and they're consistent all the way through I've seen a,0.028846353
couple people here in their describe this film as a nihilistic film and I don't,0.033305746
see it that way at all I really disagree to me this is the opposite,0.045672175
of a nihilistic film it's a film that masks itself and nihilism but it begins,0.14731956
to peel back those layers of hardened calluses to reveal what is important which is,0.019379461
love vulnerability the need to connect and how that leads us to the feeling of,0.02176747
hope that yes morality is real that people like Charles Xavier and Logan are both,0.025740612
aging rapidly and Logan seems to be rotting from the inside and in some way,0.22620814
but the fact is that were all rotting technically from the day we're born we're,0.10198729
slowly getting closer to our imminent fate so we must choose how we spend our,0.02403375
life whether it's learning to love or running away from that vulnerability in those emotions,0.039827205
and that's really the main conflict here in terms of what Logan is struggling with,0.0143865915
he's realizing that he does have responsibilities as a man and she can either of,0.050279237
course be the loner that he's always been or he can learn to take his,0.11763706
legacy and pass it on to the next generation and it's done in a way,0.028709326
that is very kind of emotionally gut wrenching I would say I was very moved,0.078923374
by the film and I think a lot of people are going to be as,0.021591196
well especially the hardcore x-men film fans there is a lot to admire about this,0.02530292
movie so yeah thumbs up and that's my review thank you all for listening if,0.03537247
