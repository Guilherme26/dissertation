up and all my nominated movies the movie I am reviewing today is one of,0.023926655
those nominated movies and the movie I am talking about is Luther needy bird it,0.059527285
has an amazing cast it has Saoirse Ronan who was in Brooklyn and she's been,0.061122395
around for a while like ever since she was a little kid she was in,0.12798133
Atonement did you know that she was briney in atonement he's also Laurie Metcalf in,0.06344788
this movie Lucas hedges who was in three billboards as well and Manchester by the,0.09232749
sea he is just killing it right now so good for you Lucas hedges it's,0.7626055
also directed by credit Gerwig I'm sorry if I pronounced any of those names wrong,0.038217463
it overall just has an amazing cast and amazing team behind it and I believe,0.023542179
chronically directed wrote it produced it she did everything basically so good for you Greta,0.031046782
Gerwig you are amazing I was super excited to see it everybody's been raving about,0.16093187
this kind of calling it the new Mean Girls a little bit too with watching,0.26390913
you now I can see that aspect to it I over all really enjoyed it,0.07342164
it definitely isn't my favorite movie of the nominated movies but it's still super good,0.030399557
and definitely deserves to be nominated it's a really fast paced movie it's only an,0.04291898
hour and 34 minutes people that is pretty short so if you're not looking for,0.099343844
a movie that is time consuming or the epic length of Titanic or Lord of,0.05365837
the Rings then this is the movie for you because it's the complete opposite of,0.06750217
that it definitely is a mixture of drama and comedy it is on the lighter,0.032482915
side in my opinion it has its very serious moments but there weren't any moments,0.03956712
in it for me that made me cry insanely or just burst out into tears,0.25276178
and meet issues or anything like that overall it's still really good and it definitely,0.04810741
does give you the feels it just doesn't bring you to Fault in Our Stars,0.032751646
level you get me as you can see I'm wearing pink because well her hair,0.041764222
is pink in here and I think her cast is pink so I figured pink,0.04783003
would work pretty well for this movie review for those of you who want statistics,0.10669612
this has an eight points zero on IMDB that is mind-blowing amazingness alright that means,0.079588555
it deserves to be nominated and it does it deserves this rating it's super duper,0.11956942
duper duper super duper good for those of you who want a synopsis and have,0.07819832
no idea what Lady Bird is about it follows this girl named Christine who nicknames,0.110062614
herself Lady Bird as she travels through her senior year of high school and is,0.06424011
about to go off to college and it's a coming-of-age story has a little bit,0.088189386
of Mean Girls esque feel at one point in time and overall it's about her,0.18459046
growing up and becoming an adult and experiencing stuff in life that she has an,0.0711527
experience before in her past I definitely believe this movie appeals to the young adult,0.06378779
crowd people that are 17 18 19 my age just because it is that coming-of-age,0.17374331
story and it is going through that senior year of high school and just being,0.011680624
19 years old right now and watching this movie I definitely related a lot to,0.02080894
it and empathize with her law on certain things just because she goes through some,0.043735825
typical high school stuff she goes through different changes she deals with her family dynamic,0.045971505
again and it's that moment in time where you're about to move on to your,0.02517321
life and become an adult and go off to college and live your life I,0.23456195
just really appreciated it especially at my age right now and I definitely want to,0.018481463
watch it when it wait older and to see a different perspective that I get,0.023304043
on it I definitely recommend this movie for people to watch I think it's really,0.067094415
really great and I think oh absolutely enjoy it so sure Ronan did an amazing,0.0750081
job and if you watched the Golden Globes I believe she won the Golden Globe,0.01791406
for Best Actress Laurie Metcalf got nominated I think that'd be the only thing that,0.024263239
I had an issue with this sometimes it seems with a little bit too fast,0.098982655
and there were moments in grey that I wish they had just kind of stopped,0.067333214
and let's sit there for a little bit for the audience but other than that,0.029164312
it's overall really really great movie that's really all I can tell you without spoiling,0.15905605
you so I suggest you go now non spoilery people go watch this movie and,0.2551297
then come back and we can talk about all the feels together alright good blue,0.035454955
get it bird lady bird overall like I said I really did enjoy this movie,0.10946927
Saoirse Ronan I felt like did an absolutely great job her character was just super,0.058627293
fun interesting seeing the dynamic of her going to a Catholic school and also growing,0.02674637
up and being a senior and dealing with the very strict environment the relationship between,0.017537566
her and her mom was absolutely interesting and I think Laura madcap did an absolutely,0.23127338
amazing job because while she was tough and strict on her daughter and it irritated,0.091335036
me I felt ladybirds irritation you also felt the love from her and you do,0.09948221
get in a way she's trying to push Lady Bird to be her best self,0.08054043
but she doesn't always do it in the best way you don't have to be,0.05396635
that hard on your daughter she's doing the best she can and probably your attitude,0.13927682
is what's causing her to rebell even more I do like that Lady Bird even,0.096482895
acknowledges in it that her mom does love her and cares a lot it was,0.24212882
just a very interesting dynamic because you can see Lady Bert's irritation with her mom,0.18844253
but then you also get that Lady Bird understands her mother's love and I thought,0.06741836
that was really cool that it wasn't just this contentious relationship I both understand each,0.023877433
other and they have their really sweet moments one of the best moments between them,0.029293356
is when Lady Bird is very hurt by her boyfriend Kyle because kayo lied and,0.09778067
said he was a virgin when he wasn't and I mom picks her up and,0.36247444
Lady Bird gets in the car and she's crying her eyes out and you're feeling,0.107006766
for her and her mom just hugs her and goes do you want to go,0.18770485
to our favorite thing and Lady Bird says yes and then they just go to,0.023704484
different houses and look at different designs that was just a really sweet moment and,0.011158456
it gives you insight into their relationship without you having to go through the whole,0.06533301
backstory of her from being a kid to now I love ladybirds dad he was,0.16973224
super kind super caring and you could see all the effort he put in he,0.012634498
was definitely a character who wasn't in it as much as I thought he was,0.03184367
going to be but he still made a really good impact which I really really,0.028553674
loved baby birds dating life though I just felt bad for her she falls in,0.22767657
love with Danny first and first of all Danny I'm gonna kill you it's just,0.80814576
wrong to do to a girl I get it you're trying to hide it and,0.18096055
I felt bad because he in a school where that is really not allowed so,0.088353686
I understand hiding it but the fact is that he didn't let ladybird know and,0.021178782
she believes that he was truly in love with her and he wasn't he was,0.09146142
just using her and he felt bad for him because you can see he's a,0.08002625
genuinely good guy I just was like why would you just not tell her I,0.052550837
mean I understand in one way but you don't need to lead her on like,0.04665199
that you can say hey I don't really think we should date that's what you,0.047231365
can do you don't have to explain why if you really don't want to I,0.042716097
did feel really bad for him and again there was the sweet moment where he,0.03834052
does visit her and he's freaking out because she saw him kissing another guy and,0.26435405
he's saying please don't tell and she just hugs him and goes I'm not gonna,0.06899218
tell and he breaks down in her arms so that was really sweet and that,0.1300281
was one thing about Danny is he did mess up really bad but you can,0.03826203
see he genuinely I think cares about ladybird as a friend more so and he,0.101440504
was just scared he didn't handle it right no he overall was just scared and,0.045804545
was looking for a way to make sure it wasn't really ever found out Kyle,0.028787153
on the other hand I did not like as soon as he was saying to,0.06348779
ladybird oh yeah I haven't done it with anybody either I just went liar you're,0.30802757
a liar it was very obvious I'm sorry that there's no way he hadn't been,0.16572918
with somebody like that before oh it sucks it sucks because at that moment it's,0.58236825
just taken away from you because you think you're sharing this moment with someone and,0.062417507
then he's saying oh yeah I've done it before heaven he's denying that he ever,0.03541571
said that he hadn't done it before and I just wanted to rewind the movie,0.02651555
somehow and play it back for Kyle and say there you said it right there,0.02414683
right there right there right there I loved ladybirds best friend Julie she was super,0.05743927
super sweet and kind and she reminds me a couple of my other friends too,0.042796586
I just loved her she was probably my favorite character actually just because she was,0.038190853
so genuinely kind and sweet and you could tell she meant well I mean Lady,0.10256799
Bird made her rubella a little bit but overall she was a goody girl of,0.22829418
this whole entire movie I did have issue in a part of the movie where,0.043032724
it goes mean girl just because I felt like that flip was insanely fast and,0.2296616
that sometimes happens throughout the yes that seems didn't linger long enough for to have,0.015428934
the super emotional impact that it did and I just felt like that transition from,0.018730242
Lady Bird abandoning Julie and going to Jannah was just SuperDuper quick because all you,0.09993586
see is her have one conversation with Kyle then all of a sudden she's talking,0.050171476
to Jenna and completely ignoring Julie I felt like there should have maybe been one,0.036332995
more scene or so I kind of connected it a little bit more because while,0.057129297
you get the sense that Kyle is popular they don't really connect him to Jenna,0.027062332
completely I mean you understand that once she starts talking to Jenna but still it,0.038293958
wasn't like he said he was best friends with Jenna or anything before unless he,0.057998028
maybe said it in the scene when they talked that they did I'm sorry I,0.024447495
don't remember that though I feel like they should have had one more scene where,0.01844022
maybe she sees Kyle hanging out with Jenna or something and then lady 4 decides,0.21108805
oh you know I'm gonna get it with Jenna so I can go see Kyle,0.04072587
I just see how quickly she turned away from Julie that was frustrating but also,0.04190258
again I felt like that happened too quickly because again if you're going for that,0.033490002
Mean Girls vibe you don't completely go against your friend like that automatically all of,0.24522798
a sudden she's needs truly one time then they're not talking anymore and I'm thinking,0.14202535
why why because Julie's amazing you need to go for Julie over Julie right right,0.04601075
Donna Lauria and go for Julie you knew it wasn't gonna work out with Jenna,0.019392764
Jenna was just annoying she was the most annoying character actually she ties with Kyle,0.24622959
her and Kyle we're just look look what you can tell you not a good,0.08428409
friend where she finally realizes where Lady Bird lives a good friend would have said,0.046816956
I don't like that you lied to me but you don't need to be ashamed,0.062764734
of where you live instead Jenna just goes I don't like this honesty we're totally,0.13304338
never ends I think I hit that right on the mark what do you guys,0.18701571
think after that her and Jenna just kind of fall off the map which I,0.272758
was quite happy about because I don't like Jenna and my other favorite moments is,0.01866971
when she does go get Julie and brings her to prom it was funny because,0.09204944
the ones we got to looking at them dancing thinking were you guys doing but,0.028064763
in the end it ended up being just this really sweet moment and going to,0.025512453
prom with your best friend is the best thing ever I'm just saying you don't,0.03929639
need a date to go to prom you can go with your best friend overall,0.05234064
though felt like it was a great movie but again I did have a little,0.033405524
bit of trouble with the quick editing just because it left some of the characters,0.04443094
a little bit underdeveloped I felt like for example Miguel and his girlfriend Shelley Shelley,0.23637317
seemed like a really interesting character and you have one moment with her and Lady,0.08460471
Bird when they're smoking and she's talking about ladybirds mom and how she really admires,0.08653374
her and that's really the only time you completely get to know Shelley and Miguel,0.02781532
you get to kind of know here and there but not fully and again his,0.04492584
moment is really when he's about to go get the job that his dad actually,0.02044176
interviewed for as well overall those were just two characters I felt like since everything,0.07462961
moved so fast you really didn't get to sit with them and understand them a,0.033005748
little bit more the only thing I really actually didn't like sadly was the ending,0.04163983
there's a super fast paced movie yeah the tragic moment where the mom doesn't get,0.043073967
out of the car to say goodbye to her daughter who's flying to New York,0.08191005
what the heck and she runs out of the car and tries to say goodbye,0.28493664
but misses her and she's breaking down in the father's arms and you feel for,0.047442894
her but then I'm saying it's your fault because you didn't get out of the,0.06277205
car the first time and you've been a jerk to her about this even though,0.47643456
she got it even though you thought she wasn't gonna get in so she proved,0.0973044
you wrong in that you should just own up to it and eventually just prohibit,0.11356082
her but what it does is cut you her in New York and basically what,0.0961503
it shows us her goes to this party get drunk make out the dude throw,0.17243023
up the dude brings her to the hospital and then she gets out of the,0.09945759
hospital find her way back to church even though after going to the Catholic school,0.15076254
it seemed like she really wanted to stay away from religion and then she calls,0.1292412
her mom and leaves a message and says I love you and it was a,0.1380622
very sweet moment do not get me wrong I loved that she said I love,0.105867304
you to her mom I think that is a great way to end it but,0.32682532
it didn't feel complete after that I was waiting for more the movie to show,0.02059076
her being successful in college or that her mom listened to the voice message you,0.06382371
see her mom's reaction to it I was waiting for something and then all of,0.23128898
a sudden she says I love you and then the screen goes black and the,0.029278724
credits start rolling and I was sitting there going that's it so I don't really,0.02132978
know how to feel about the ending I feel like I wanted to happen was,0.030730154
seeing her really thrive for being College and show that she's alright when her mom,0.14958583
really didn't think she was going to be I guess then had this moment where,0.020623354
she really does miss her and get through that call or just something maybe if,0.025945488
they had added a scene at the end where they showed the mom reacting to,0.048713394
the voicemail and you know the mom got the voicemail maybe I would have felt,0.14082868
more complete about it all I'm not sure there's just something missing at the end,0.029728388
for me and maybe you disagree with me and think it was the most perfect,0.06369267
ending ever and I feel like it could have been a perfect ending I do,0.19734669
like how she said I love you to her mom at the end but there,0.13675644
was just something else needed I felt like and I'm not sure what it is,0.016826486
and it's killing me and I don't know what it is and maybe everybody else,0.37658662
thinks it's a perfect ending and I'm just crazy what do you guys think of,0.10500389
the ending for those of you who have seen it do you agree with me,0.1017272
do you think it was a little bit short or do you think that it,0.036559157
was a great ending overall that is really all I have to say about this,0.049397867
movie though I thought it was overall pretty good there were little problems here and,0.07737616
there but I just absolutely enjoyed it still overall thank you so much for joining,0.047535352
