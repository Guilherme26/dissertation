hello everybody today I'm going to be reviewing Citizen Kane this came out in 1941,0.17312935
it was directed by Orson Welles he also co-wrote it and starred in it and,0.01885197
produced it and you all knew that this was coming because I talk about worse,0.05909159
and Welles so damn much how could I not eventually get to the point where,0.27665636
I had to review Citizen Kane so here you go Orson Welles really needs no,0.027521973
introduction at this point especially if you are a sent a file but I'll give,0.060517076
him one anyway just because it really does feed into the inception of Citizen Kane,0.03579619
in terms of his history as a creative person he was 25 years old when,0.02448408
the film was made but before that point ever since he was a little kid,0.047185466
he was considered to be a child prodigy and he was very ambitious he grew,0.050877903
up to be this iconoclast who changed the medium of all kinds of different art,0.030800663
forms you changed the medium of theater on Broadway when he went to New York,0.032075822
at age 21 and did a lot of very famous performances there from you know,0.014946677
Shakespearean plays and such and of course he changed radio with his very infamous War,0.14855613
of the Worlds broadcast when he was 23 years old in the late 30s and,0.014893462
at the time he was on fire he was considered just this great genius people,0.10379193
bowed down to him and they thought he could do no wrong and so of,0.034610834
course eventually Hollywood called because at the time Hollywood was such a mecca still is,0.027125524
but not to the point that it was back in the 30s but Hollywood had,0.014939359
such faith in him that they gave him complete creative control to do whatever he,0.023122448
wanted basically and from what I understand Welles had several ideas and Citizen Kane is,0.018665053
what they decided on but the fact that they gave him total control is just,0.014714528
it staggers the imagination especially for somebody that is 25 years old it was unheard,0.042042267
of it never happened since course Citizen Kane is known to be one of the,0.017031362
great films of all time and you know the American Film Institute ranks in number,0.037928108
one as the greatest American film ever made and so you know if you're a,0.022876332
fan of film it's like the buy home American movies you know most really big,0.028954113
film fans have seen this film but ironically it was not very popular when it,0.016501876
came out it did get some notoriety certainly with critics but it wasn't a big,0.048960842
box-office smash like that Citizen Kane is known for being very innovative for kind of,0.03249688
breaking the form of so many Hollywood films up to that point technically in terms,0.04185269
of story ironically I find this film to be Welles at his most safe certainly,0.054888293
at his most kind of tame it's his most commercially acceptable film that he ever,0.084173
made I think because he was such a novice and he really didn't know that,0.051745966
much about film he was kind of feeling his way through testing the waters as,0.02282378
he was making the film I think it only makes sense for this film to,0.040123213
be kind of more of a blank slate for him but for this to be,0.03999949
his first big commercial film his first Hollywood film you can see it he was,0.023631314
just so beyond his years and everyone has tried to emulate this film in some,0.040954027
form in pretty much every way without that film movie certainly would not be what,0.04106977
they are today Welles is a very big personality and he certainly has quite an,0.026244821
ego as well and that really does come through in his films I think because,0.057413332
this movies just tend to be very very dramatic in pretty much every sense of,0.07123518
the word everything from the very Shakespearean nature of the way that the characters speak,0.037753165
in the wind that the dialogue certainly and the strange humor the very dark shadows,0.05423176
the gothic angles it's very expressionistic it's very creative and it broke so many rules,0.061762966
I have to say when I ask people what they think about when they think,0.034779128
about Citizen Kane they think about technical prowess because technically the film was so innovative,0.03275963
as I said but I think honestly deep I mean below that I think there's,0.052908707
a lot in the film that resonates with people because of the story the story,0.024057033
itself is I think very entertaining at its heart is a story that is very,0.036124792
familiar has very grandiose themes and it is a kind of tragic cautionary tale with,0.018532017
Charles Foster Kane as the protagonist people are people are drawn to drama they're drawn,0.048115395
to excess and extraordinary people not only do they have big personalities but they they,0.04160857
are like exaggerated versions of us they're they're very manipulative they're very motivated by X,0.080304295
and greed most of the time people like this are people that come off is,0.05606833
very confident but they are often the most insecure the most sad the most flawed,0.03243502
people and they don't know how to connect on a human level so they use,0.17736523
all of this excess to fill those voids and that is precisely the story of,0.08351913
Charles Foster Kane in terms of his downfall even though maybe the film may alienate,0.031690013
some viewers because they may find it a little bit too strange or maybe a,0.067505494
little bit too esoteric the film is a story that we've seen many many times,0.030144127
and it's that rags to riches story you know in the case of this film,0.06259578
you start with a very young child who is you know taken from his family,0.11432777
and he becomes a young man who runs a newspaper and then he becomes this,0.03671348
very notorious very wealthy mogul glorified by the public and by the media what I,0.029759651
love about this film is how the core story is framed it's framed and told,0.027009116
through the eyes of the journalists and through the media that are trying to figure,0.033978246
out who the real Kane is the man behind this emblem of American success they're,0.056804024
so fascinated by who he must have been behind that persona so what they do,0.08305416
they try to interview all of these people in his life like ex-wives people that,0.18143949
he worked with and friends because they're just looking for some kind of key some,0.028926842
kind of answer to all these questions I think that's part of what the film,0.039563127
is trying to say is that there are so many interpretations to everything everything is,0.0102172205
so complex and in this case everyone that he knew has their own interpretation of,0.02095395
who Kane was depending on you know who the person was and at what time,0.025423985
they knew him in his life so who can truly know the difference between the,0.07130569
persona and the man and that idea is reflected in the the way that the,0.020897409
film is structured because it has a very elliptical feel to it and I have,0.026210232
seen the film many times but I honestly I couldn't tell you how its structured,0.026625305
scene for scene because it's not a beginning middle and end sort of thing you,0.079728246
know as I said it's told through the framework of these journalists interviewing all of,0.042904343
these people and it goes back in time and then forward quite a bit when,0.046765737
you've got all of these little pieces all over the place it's often near impossible,0.08845413
to try to make sense of it all as a whole but even though I'm,0.03047805
talking a lot about the story as a film nerd I'm probably more fascinated by,0.22758967
just the look of the film even by today's standards this film just looks very,0.013211212
contemporary and especially for that time this was just a major jump forward it felt,0.051552396
like in terms of how innovative it was I mean the camera moves so fluidly,0.030215302
and compared to so many Hollywood movies at the time where the camera was just,0.0160123
very stagnant very still and I think that people like maybe David Fincher might have,0.026470983
borrowed from wells in the sense that when you watch a feature film he loves,0.041297927
to make films that have touches of CGI here and there but he likes to,0.037574228
make it very subtle he wants to kind of confuse the audience member so that,0.06260775
they don't know what they're watching is real and what is enhanced by digital techniques,0.03527136
wells really was one of the first people to use that particularly in Hollywood as,0.03931834
it was becoming bigger and bigger and the special effects in this film are used,0.036118805
so subtly to make each image work and the fluidity of it the angles of,0.018192107
it and the shadows the use of deep focus it's just so complex and so,0.017505638
interesting to look at and even though Welles was a showman obviously he was a,0.034670703
magician and a performer the special effects and the the visual style that he's going,0.028294252
for it means something it's not just a show for the sake of showing his,0.03583078
visual prowess like his use of deep focus that's one of my favorite things that,0.050347086
he's ever utilized in any of his films I just love that style it works,0.12892057
very well for him and you know it allows for such dimension in terms of,0.01848745
the look of it so it's literal dimension but also figurative dimension because there's so,0.028367423
much going on in the background to the foreground it basically tells the story that,0.025847707
the characters never have to say so basically when you look at a shot you,0.18605852
could see all kinds of different things built around a certain character that might be,0.02216658
at the center of the shot that's a metaphor for the fact that there's so,0.07158374
much beneath the surface beneath what is said and what the characters may do but,0.015635142
even though the film is known for being one of the great films the whole,0.027498027
time it obviously has its detractors and there has been some criticism of it that,0.024895828
the film has such technical bravura but it's not matched with emotional potency and I,0.02749337
can actually see where they're coming from because especially if you know Wells is later,0.030366298
work even though most of it is largely forgotten by mainstream audiences he became much,0.016219838
more mature as a storyteller as he went on like even even the Magnificent Ambersons,0.058558777
which came out not too long after Citizen Kane that is a very heartbreaking very,0.029427059
emotional piece that to me is far more evolved than Kane is but that being,0.03911546
said I actually find a lot of emotional moments in Kane that really do resonate,0.01907281
with me when Kane meets Susan his second wife for the first time that's when,0.06964938
the film really starts to hone in on something that has gravitas it's a really,0.022046182
sad relationship because he's drawn to her for her naivete her innocence her humor her,0.12542503
the fact that she needs to be taken care of and they meet Kane relates,0.0870925
to her in that sense because he sees kind of a version of who he,0.072971314
was when he was younger before all the success and all of that and it's,0.026800249
at the tender scene and a sad one because of how I mean once you,0.05533064
see the film and you go back and watch it it's maybe very bittersweet because,0.045000337
you see how the relationship turns sour quite quickly their relationship gets to the heart,0.04408438
of what makes Kane so flawed he's a man who was used to covering everything,0.091986254
up as I said with extravagance with politics with publicity and wealth to distract him,0.049940657
from what he wanted most all he really wanted as we all do all we,0.02390936
really want is to be loved and he wanted to be able to understand himself,0.033390224
but because he couldn't grasp that or himself he turned outward for any means of,0.02754592
control and that happened to be in the form of Susan he starts to control,0.01534113
her and starts trying to turn her into his puppet into this opera singer that,0.24053448
she's obviously not meant to be that's when you realize how selfish how insecure he,0.2100364
is she becomes his possession essentially that really reflects what happened so many marriages and,0.029629275
relationships if you can't understand the person that you're with you try to turn them,0.107083924
into a version of yourself or the person you were or the person that you,0.12266452
want to be as the film goes on it unmasks this kind of male dominant,0.17178102
man that depends on prowess and that public persona of course I can't talk about,0.021081
Citizen Kane without mentioning one of the most famous devices utilized in American movie history,0.021488758
and that of course is the famous rosebud which the film is built around rosebud,0.009544055
at its most basic level is a metaphor for nostalgia for the innocence of chav,0.055699818
of childhood that was taken away from him but I don't know if I buy,0.0260599
into the idea that rosebud should be this MacGuffin that's supposed to represent the point,0.041939165
of the film because I think that that's too simplistic it's certainly way too simplistic,0.036938976
for Welles I don't think that he saw it as a powerful device either even,0.025181193
when he was making it I think he found it amusing and used it as,0.022646843
a joke in an interview he once called it a tawdry device a dollar book,0.08525526
Freudian gag and he wasn't very proud of it what I think is a much,0.1871727
more powerful metaphor and one that works much better would be the idea of the,0.021498071
puzzle pieces because you see puzzle pieces used throughout the film all the time that's,0.03988574
just far more effective as a device because it represents this tapestry of elements that,0.040942717
we are trying to fit together in order to understand life people focus on rosebud,0.064981125
because it's clear and it's easy rosebud to me is that joke on the audience,0.027861217
because obviously there's much more to the film than that and obviously you can't sum,0.019294316
up a single memory or a man's life with just one word as I said,0.066617474
I really admire this film a lot obviously but I don't think it's the best,0.034929458
film ever made I don't think you can really say that there is one film,0.02757785
that is the greatest film ever made just like you can't say there's one piece,0.030088251
of music that's the best music ever made there's no such thing it's all up,0.034529682
to interpretation Welles made so many interesting films that push the envelope way harder I,0.05742464
mean my favorite film of his is the trial masterpiece not an easy one to,0.03514032
understand and I don't recommend it to people unless you're of course in a file,0.0394853
but it is same with the films like f-for fake he he did so many,0.23367064
amazing works but I think the reasons this and Cain has enjoyed is because it's,0.02856365
that balance between maybe a more esoteric style that pushed the boundaries and something that,0.01823335
was mainstream that people could latch on to in terms of the core story it,0.01669744
has an accessibility that films that I think are far better do not have like,0.049694538
as I said the trial or a film like wings of desire or The Passion,0.019297643
of Joan of Arc to me I think are far better films but they just,0.034720592
don't have that accessibility and I know a lot of times I always say that,0.02216525
I'm against accessibility but I think at a certain point in order to you know,0.051882993
as I said bring people together and have something resonate and be there as maybe,0.023045287
a benchmark that people can emulate or try to be inspired by you need to,0.038933866
have that to be able to further the medium of film or whatever medium we're,0.012838044
talking about so in that sense I think Citizen Kane is really wonderful and should,0.024847936
be studied and it is greatly admired and it's also a really just it's a,0.1368489
good film it's entertaining it's a great story and that is my review thank you,0.036119472
