hi everyone its Alisa and this is always a mushy the place that encourages you,0.16035606
to go out get dressed up and watch a movie so today I am reviewing,0.18432365
ladybird and that stars Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf and it is directed and written,0.18719852
by Greta Gerwig and I'll start by saying that this is one of the best,0.06532117
coming-of-age films that I've ever seen in my life but I want to add the,0.113151185
caveat that coming-of-age movies are not always my favorite genre so this is an excellent,0.098820046
film within the genre but there are always going to be movies that I like,0.03941208
more than this type of movie so the film centers around Christine who has renamed,0.06832485
herself to Lady Bird and that's played by Saoirse Ronan and she's just trying to,0.15463577
navigate herself within Sacramento California and trying to figure out who she is and she's,0.11126929
kind of this moderate rebel who thinks she's a lot more you know hard-hitting and,0.31089434
edgy than she actually is and she's just trying to work within the confines of,0.1892715
this really strict parochial school that she lives in and also trying to find a,0.07795353
balance with her mother who is just overly protective and totally controlling but you can,0.26814702
see that the mother really loves her daughter and that's played by Laurie Metcalf beautifully,0.13635767
she's she's incredible in the film and you know so the film really has all,0.07380598
of the story arcs that you've come to expect in a coming-of-age story you have,0.06849281
things like first boyfriend's trying to prove yourself to the wrong crab fights with mom,0.31089434
there's the desire to get away from the nest and yes even prom but the,0.06613895
film handles all of these milestones with a great sense of realism and then there's,0.10835273
just like this little bit of nostalgia thrown in as well and what I've really,0.27873355
loved about the story is that even though the entire story it centers around Lady,0.11467284
Bird I felt like I really understood beside characters and they were really well developed,0.050529577
so everyone from father to her best friend to her first boyfriend they all had,0.09723621
lives that were going on outside the screen and even if they were in that,0.06837818
particular scene I felt like I knew who they were and I knew what they,0.076638125
were doing and that's really a testament to Greta Gerwig 'he's writing it really is,0.05943347
a brilliant screenplay it's very well thought out and you know I would be shocked,0.06885432
if she didn't get a nomination for Best screenwriting I think she did a wonderful,0.06522278
job in just developing all these characters even certain characters that you would think would,0.12886152
be like stock throwaway characters like you know the new friend that Lady Bird is,0.10076168
trying to make who's rich and obnoxious and self-centered and yes that character is all,0.63261235
of those things but there's actually a few moments in the film where you see,0.050454445
she's not just everything that she presents to everyone else and I really like that,0.13172922
there wasn't one stock character in plays like the bad girl or like the dorky,0.6663523
bestfriend they all had layers to them and I really appreciated that in her writing,0.10819159
the film also takes on some interesting points in in terms of class division in,0.041694887
suburban neighborhoods so when a lot of suburbs there will be you know people who,0.12888028
are really big upper class upper middle class and then there are the houses that,0.0814149
are middle-class you know lower middle-class and you know that there is this great divide,0.13557121
so while no one is living in poverty it still affects the way that certain,0.08965272
characters have to present themselves to others and I thought that was something I wasn't,0.038174666
quite expecting in a film like this Lady Bird is quite literally from the other,0.24228491
side of the tracks and it affects her on a daily life going to this,0.13073578
very rich exclusive parochial school and then the other thing that I thought was so,0.09442251
interesting is it kind of goes into that quintessential you don't know what you got,0.16965093
till it's gone the way that teenagers always look at the place where they grew,0.07661252
up as just the lamest place in the world but when you look back on,0.30137017
it you see that your family and your environment it's actually so much better than,0.1002426
you ever thought it was when you're growing up and when you leave you kind,0.31089434
of can't wait to come back home and feel that comfort again the film also,0.07584872
does a pretty good job in terms of the way that it's shot there's a,0.10981499
lot of you know muted neutral colors it is very nostalgic looking and you have,0.088671684
you know just some lovely beautiful shots in the film although I will say that,0.15292731
I don't think the movie actually utilized all of the film techniques that they probably,0.055954278
could have so you know this movie is much more about story character and heart,0.04751467
and for me to think a film is perfect it really needs to have all,0.07607555
of those components plus some inventive film artistry which shines most about this film is,0.07776395
definitely the performances and I don't have a doubt in my mind that Saoirse Ronan,0.1516863
is going to be nominated for Best Actress for the Academy Awards and the Golden,0.04189566
Globes it's the exact kind of character and performance that I feel will certainly get,0.037019547
nominated and she is deserving of it and I'm pretty sure that Laurie Metcalf is,0.11453028
going to be nominated for Best Supporting Actress for playing the mother I mean the,0.08532958
scenes with the two of them together they are the funniest and the most genuine,0.09830282
in the film if anything I kind of wish there was a little more development,0.10988101
and a little bit more scenes with her and her mom although I know that's,0.35974348
not realistic to teenage life you're not really with your mom all the time so,0.49431843
I just think that they are wonderful together and Ronan has said that Lady Bird,0.12874484
is a mixture of Greta Gerwig life with you know a lot of Ronan's input,0.15548904
as well and she creates a character that is just flawed but beautiful at the,0.15428016
same time am she really is trying to navigate herself and figure out who she,0.08482362
is so she's at that point in life where a lot of teenagers will just,0.120379224
almost try on different personalities to see which one they are because they're not really,0.09036009
sure which personality they are and you see her navigate her life through the theatre,0.10786475
group and then the rich-kid group and she's trying to figure out exactly who she,0.14574857
is and I think a lot of people although not myself are going to find,0.23965345
you know the relationship between the mother and the daughter so relatable they have such,0.18585451
difficulty trying to communicate but you know that they love each other and that with,0.054411322
the mother everything she's doing is because she loves her daughter but she certainly comes,0.28345576
across as smothering and overbearing and you know constantly barging in on her and you,0.2115671
know I think a lot of people are going to relate to that relationship and,0.041453335
I love that Ronan never takes that character and just makes her an angsty teenager,0.21551628
there are a lot of layers layers to her and she really reflects on who,0.13804327
she is and that is very realistic two teenagers believe me I'm with them all,0.15072474
day long they do stop and they think about how they behaved and they'll reflect,0.15859501
and they know they want to change sometimes and they're not just sure they're not,0.07121336
so sure how and I found that you know a lot of the aspects of,0.047963817
her character are incredibly realistic so you know the performances they are phenomenal now I'll,0.08850415
be honest I am not the biggest fan of Greta Gerwig I've never really liked,0.10368863
her very much in films even if I like the film I'm not a week,0.13293652
crazy about her she sort of comes off as such a hipster and like she's,0.67170054
trying to be overly cool and and trying to always fit in with the cool,0.08554723
kids and I thought Francis ha was one of the most overrated movies I found,0.10558329
it just painful to watch but really with Gerwig behind the camera she's proven that,0.15526868
she certainly understands how to capture a foundational moment in life I'm now at a,0.12636544
point that I'm really excited to see what Greta Gerwig is going to do in,0.09124774
the future I feel like she has definitely found where she belongs being behind the,0.10038631
camera she knows what she's doing as a director she certainly understands tone she really,0.1544617
understands character development I think she's an even a writer that's really where her niche,0.2403395
is she is a phenomenal writer so I really am happy to see where she's,0.0756466
gonna go in the future and I can say that now I actually like Greta,0.06798452
Gerwig so I just want to add that I know this movie won best picture,0.06049813
for the new the New York Film Critics Circle awards and I don't think that,0.09203378
this is the best picture of the year at all I could think of like,0.03898696
six films that were definitely better than this film in terms of story character development,0.090769514
meaning and I haven't even seen all of the heavy hitters yet so you know,0.10007078
I cannot wait to see the shape of water I can't wait to see three,0.089291155
billboards outside Epping Missouri that I'm gonna see next week and do a review and,0.14817111
I still haven't seen mud bound so they're still you know a few films coming,0.24252936
out that I have even higher hopes for I'm not saying that Lady Bird is,0.1056844
bad and it doesn't deserve this attention I just don't necessarily think that this is,0.15433745
the best but if I look back to last year and everyone was ranting and,0.077441074
raving about the edge of seventeen well this movie definitely runs circles around that movie,0.14921589
it is you know without a doubt the better of the coming-of-age stories but I'm,0.1024084
never going to say that a coming-of-age story is the best film of the year,0.057580717
but you know this is the best you can get within that storyline and now,0.05572278
for the green so first film and artistry if I'm looking at Lady Bird as,0.07921342
just a straight-up drama with comedic elements then I would have to give it an,0.17505501
A - their performances are outstanding the writing is stellar although I do feel like,0.052700788
it lacked some of the filmic elements that I'm looking for there's not as much,0.12728897
artistry the music didn't really tie everything together for me which is another thing that,0.069992796
I look for so it was really great for what it was but like I,0.06624817
said I'm never gonna look at a coming-of-age story as you know the greatest now,0.081274554
if I'm just reading this at the coming a story I would definitely give it,0.044607744
an a it's one of the best examples you'll ever find but I don't know,0.10119478
if I would put it in such a small category as that so in terms,0.103901766
of watchability I would give ladybird and a - I really enjoyed it but it's,0.15107559
not the kind of movie that I think I'll go back and watch again and,0.12654847
again everyone else I feel like has a real sense of connection to this movie,0.069847554
which is why they are going nuts over it but I found that my adolescent,0.3540957
years I didn't really connect to this character so much my family my friends they've,0.056760464
always joked around and made fun of me because they thought that I acted like,0.086543456
this adult from the time I was basically a kid and that in my teenage,0.24634476
years I didn't really act anything like a teenager my mom still talks about how,0.15706511
I never really acted like a teenager so it was hard for me to relate,0.10141005
to what she was going through and that's kind of like moving through friend groups,0.083679646
I just didn't experience that but that's because I'm just straight-up weird I also didn't,0.10239876
connect the relationship with her and her mother the relationship that I had and have,0.103104785
with my mom isn't anything like that you know in the movie the characters really,0.16033931
controlling my mom's not controlling at all she was always really proud of me growing,0.18507099
up so I just I didn't have that same sense of connection that I think,0.06706455
some people are having when they're watching this movie almost you know seeing that wow,0.07615893
this is my wife and this is what I went through what I I'm not,0.11072734
really I didn't have that experience watching this film but I did really like it,0.06297481
so with that said please leave a comment below if you if you saw ladybird,0.31089434
tell me what you think does it deserve Best Picture for the New York Film,0.10771469
Critics Circle let me know what you think if you like this video leave a,0.2860672
