welcome back to my channel today on my channel I'll be reviewing a quiet place,0.13046966
a quiet place is a 2018 American horror film directed by John Krasinski from a,0.0027986788
screenplay by Brian Wood Scott Beck and Krasinski based on a story by Woods and,0.07297266
Bek the film follows a family who must live their life in silence while hiding,0.19753118
from creatures which hunt exclusively by sound despite all the film's praise I tried my,0.07043137
best to keep my expectations low this was mostly because I was fearing it turning,0.05696282
into another don't breathe scenario where everyone loves it so hard that I'm expecting something,0.17744692
amazing and then when I finally get to watch it I end up hating it,0.33269984
with a fiery passion that being said there were many things I enjoy about this,0.10162261
film though ultimately I was not nearly as enamored by it as much as the,0.07680942
public seemed to be from the moment the film began I found its filming choices,0.023417324
quite for hitting I knew I was going into a film that moreso the time,0.17868575
was going to lack sound but even though I knew this I wasn't expecting the,0.06763909
extent in many films even when there is an absence of dialogue there is still,0.078265324
background noise or even a score to keep the audience engaged when this film begins,0.06909911
there is nothing it is so quiet I honestly felt something was wrong with the,0.10919657
copy I was watching but everything was just fine it was impressive to see how,0.05361503
far in they were willing to go and how far they would take the concept,0.047454763
the slightest noise even so much as a pin dropping means death and for that,0.31089434
reason they take every precaution to avoid any and all sound watching this inaction was,0.09394059
deafening it was a shock to my senses and made me very uncomfortable which meant,0.15323736
it was doing its job and for that reason I was hooked when the film,0.06533138
surprises you with the burst of sound you feel the level of alarm and panic,0.14411585
and induces and it is perfectly acted out in our performers faces that instant feel,0.0824327
where your mind races with all the ways this moment could turn out but the,0.18907642
most important being will you survive I felt these moments were inserted very smartly and,0.26547593
sporadically they weren't one after another which would have been overkill and not fit the,0.091730006
tone of the film the cinematography I found was quite simple but in this case,0.0641037
simple works perfect for what maybe is you're already doing something incredible when it comes,0.15292042
to sound you're so strongly focused on how to utilize one sense that I think,0.15739137
if they had amped up the visuals it would have just become a sensory Emily,0.093323864
Blunt for me is the standout performer of this film while I felt everyone did,0.072970115
a phenomenal job she of course took it to a whole other level there is,0.067793295
a lot of range to her character fear pain determined protective loving and seeing her,0.07365966
act out each of these things was just incredible I was truly blown away by,0.0963624
what she brought to this film as for Millicent Simmons while her breakthrough role was,0.09266105
in 2017 so wonderstruck her role in this film and what this film represents when,0.14169231
it comes to the hearing impaired community is a breakthrough all in itself it's really,0.1548498
great to see minority Act as being given more roles and what I liked in,0.052053906
this film is that usually when you see an actor with an impairment on screen,0.11375044
the character is very obviously part of the minority and they stand out from everyone,0.07086491
else and are almost depicted as abnormal but amidst despite her condition she's not depicted,0.11382778
as abnormal at all due to the circumstances she's very much like everyone else while,0.2945442
she can't hear and doesn't speak she's not made to feel different because no one,0.15063068
else is able to speak and therefore there is nothing to hear most of the,0.05025433
time I found that quite interesting to witness I was surprised by how many people,0.064364806
were killed in this movie I honestly wasn't expecting everyone to die I was thinking,0.5819256
it would be one of those movies where it's all about the suspense and the,0.065146334
anticipation of death but no actual death so when it happens I was quite stunned,0.267237
and again impressed however I was not impressed with the creatures themselves and I did,0.057411518
feel we were exposed to them true soon and that took away a lot of,0.07782112
the suspense for me I felt their appearance was true over the top for a,0.088751994
film with such a simple style the final confrontation with them did remind me a,0.16596052
fair bit of signs you think everyone screwed but in the last second they figure,0.49544585
out the one thing that can kill them that no one was able to figure,0.73602194
out their appearance I was expecting something I'd never seen before that these creatures honestly,0.18361486
look like a venom and the truth fairies from Hellboy had a baby so because,0.35086173
it felt reminiscent of another I wasn't very impressed by them there was some what,0.07666667
I would consider convenient plot points that were inserted into the film and I personally,0.23416072
find it aggravating when anything is done for the sake of convenience especially in a,0.080169804
horror movie it just lowers the quality for me because it feels lazy for example,0.26354158
the scene with the nail I felt was unnecessary we already have the character going,0.06040847
into labor and trying to be quiet about it which is next to impossible and,0.23950224
this was Blunt standout moment of the film for me I imagine that's much like,0.060213223
what Scientology is like point is this moment was stressful enough and I'm sure could,0.08737366
have still led to making noise so the addition of the nail bit I was,0.093795925
unimpressed with the silo scene I felt again added an unnecessary moment to the film,0.085529014
the entire circumstances of the film are intense and dangerous enough so inserting this scene,0.23989935
that was about how can we up the danger factor again I felt was pushing,0.07728244
it my other issue was found in the final scene when they realized the creatures,0.09959059
weakness and they use it to fight back this I also found a bit convenient,0.1509271
I'm not sure how all the scribbles on the walls and the newspaper articles everywhere,0.14974593
allowed her to piece together what their weakness was and how she could utilize it,0.17835733
she did seem to figure that out abnormally fast and piece it together in a,0.08180146
way I just don't understand so while the logic of what their weakness is I,0.1118462
think is perfect and makes total sense how they discovered it in that moment I,0.057706475
didn't find believable I'm also trying to piece together where the creatures come from from,0.062399816
the newspaper clippings I assume they appeared from a meteor or asteroid that was mentioned,0.15283261
but I'm not sure if so that would again make them aliens and would once,0.17863919
again remind me of science overall there was a lot that I was impressed with,0.069328986
and I am certainly blown away with how this film uses sound and the absence,0.15334085
of sound to create a story and how they depicted it was incredible and as,0.030664025
I mentioned the performances were stellar but there are still things about this film I,0.04106869
was not impressed with it being a horror film I never felt scared or even,0.1529614
really felt that suspenseful and when moments reminded me of other films what little suspense,0.093731634
I was feeling was instantly diminished so these elements had zero impact on me I,0.19112222
honestly only jumped once and it was because the dad popped up out of nowhere,0.205723
prior to seeing it I felt a sequel was ridiculous having now seen it I,0.5154597
do see how the ending lends itself to a sequel but I personally don't feel,0.22003368
it needs one after the success of this I don't believe a sequel will match,0.10576018
what this has done and will just end up as another staple that is there,0.07380335
to make money but contributes absolutely nothing ultimately still a solid film thank you so,0.06832292
much for watching this video if you liked it don't forget to hit that thumbs,0.19991647
