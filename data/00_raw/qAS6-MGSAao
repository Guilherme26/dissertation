now the Irishman is supposed to be Netflix's movie right it's three and a half hours long it has a hundred and sixty million dollar budget it has fancy new D aging VFX front and center in a year where that's all the rage right some of Hollywood's most legendary talent and a sophisticated debut at the New York Film Festival in fact they even had the press screening at Alice Tully Hall where the film will debut this evening and they hardly ever do that for press they cram us into the wall to read so that was that was real nice and because I think they wanted everyone including the critics to feel that this is a movie Scorsese lobbied hard but failed to get it a theatrical wide release but the theater owners still really hate Netflix because they won't do at least like a two-month window before digital release I think this is only gonna be like two weeks right theaters before you can watch it on streaming but Netflix is rumored to have actually bought the Paris theater here in New York City a prestige venue for this very movie but ironically I think this is actually better suited for streaming and I think that's actually the case with Romo as well both are a long slog like wow like remember how a lot of you wrote me and said like I had a hard time getting through Romo Grace and I felt at the end it was worth it some of you agreed with me some of you didn't some of you never made it to the end of Romo and I think it's a similar situation with the Irishman now I think that because this is an English it's in color right and it has Hollywood actors with the more commercial storytelling and performances it'll probably be better received by audiences overall than Romo was right I think more people will get to the end of this movie now as for award season I don't know I think that its strongest bet is a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Joe Pesci who is wonderfully understated here I was really impressed with his work it's in stark contrast to his other iconic Scorsese performance in good which he already want an Oscar for so I don't know if he's gonna win an Oscar here again for the same director but I'm very maybe because it's such a different role he could and also Pesci was uh nominated for Scorsese's Raging Bull so there's a very not only is there are good awards history there voters love that kind of stuff but it's a very good actor director collaboration indeed Scorsese actually looks after a number of actors but this you know maybe this being just so different than Pesci's iconic persona right it was funny in fact to sometimes watch them cuz it's so long and someone sometimes it's not that good we're gonna talk about that sometimes it's very good but in some of the slower moments I was like it's so funny that's Harry from home alone hilarious he's Joe Pesci favorite character in the movie he's so adorable well they you know but it towards the end when he was like a grandpa's I was this one to go the whole movie I wanted to scope and give him a hug he was so awesome and he had like a cool look he actually had glasses a little bit like my new glasses maybe that maybe that's why I felt a kinship with him alright so obviously the big question is how successful is the D aging VFX right which is supposedly responsible for the sky-high budget although I think a lot of people got paid big time here talk about the mob to do it this on Netflix although you know nobody else really wanted to foot the budget right I believe that was the that was a situation although seeing the movie I wouldn't paid one hundred and sixty million dollars for this either as speaking of the aging as I said in my trailer reaction for this movie I find it ironic that if this technology existed back in the 1970s DeNiro never would have gotten his big breakout role as young Vito Corleone Marlon Brando just would have played the role himself although I don't know Marlon Brando would have gone along with this he'd be like no thank you especially maybe after he saw how it turned out when they showed him the test he'd be like it doesn't even work I don't really think that it does in some shots it does but then it's weird cuz the very next shot you're like did you turn off the D aging and they're like it's just not as clean some shots what do you want from us so De Niro and Pesci here play the younger versions of themselves and they cover quite a long their lives acting-wise I think they do that very well but technology wise well the face D aging is again somewhat effective all Scorsese accomplishes is putting young faces on older bodies both in how they look and how they move I don't know if you saw the reason I didn't notice it as much in Captain Marvel but the recent honest trailer for that pointed out that Sam Jackson even types like like an older gentleman despite the D aging on his face but here you really notice it particularly the first D H seen they have De Niro and Pesci working on a truck engine and in the close-ups there their hands are noticeably the hands of you know guys who are as old as of Pesci and De Niro actually are so that was it was just it was just jarring and you're like I don't know if this was worth it I mean they could have just dyed their hair black as I think they did to some degree and it would have been the same thing but thankfully De Niro Pesci and mr. Al Pacino are legendary for being their own best special effects and what keeps this movie interesting throughout are their incredible performances not just incredible but it's interesting to see all three of them play roles that are so different than how we are famous for knowing them right so De Niro is differential right a soldier instead of a general and the army analogy to the mob is used I think very effectively subtly but I think effectively the movies very subtle in many regards I wonder how much people will actually pick up about what it's saying I picked up a lot and I still found it kind of boring in places all right so Pesci is calm collected and a respected leader I know and Pacino is totally out of control but also a total lovable softie ah he was so sweet but by the way his supposedly emphasis on supposedly Midwestern accent was all over the place sometimes it decided to show up to say sometimes it didn't I'd be like just forget it al you can't do it consistently so forget it I guess there's I forget the accents forget the D aging technology this is just a very good play which is I think is also good way to sit smallest good streaming show that's a good way to describe it I also appreciated the history of the mob Hoffa and the Kennedys you know that's not very rarely delved into and as the movie continually points out many people today don't even know who Jimmy Hoffa is and I think cuz they're focusing on how uh instead of perhaps the Kennedys part of the story that's very much in the background and not until like the second half for the last third of the last hour or so or the movie I don't know how riveted it will be for people who aren't into history but I like history so I thought that stuff was cool I also like the subtle revelation again sometimes the movie might be too subtle for its own good but I like this connection that banks back in the day couldn't get involved in gambling so they couldn't invest in casinos and such fare so that left that left an opening for the mob but today of course banks and all businesses are involved in all kinds of shady dealings with often government involvement so there's no business left for the mob and as I said that's really interesting when you think about it so I liked that takeaway there also as is usually the case with this type of movie plenty of little and big life lessons to learn and some scenes sprinkled throughout as I said the movie has some serious laws but there are scenes here and there with almost Tarantino level dialogue and shoot again far not throughout not consistent but there were a lot of scenes where people in the audience was laughing very hard myself included very good De Niro and Pesci also shine showing their characters towards the end of their lives the passage of time physically mentally and this is a zinger emotionally I was pretty blown away the final few scenes are incredibly moving really I mean I've told you before you want to open your movie strong and you want to end your movie strong I think the movie did kind of open strong open strong but it ended I'm sure that it ended very strong and I think that'll help how people remember it again if you get you'll get to the end of a Scorsese movie it might take you a few days but you'll get there and I thought that the ending was so moving that I think it could end up getting De Niro and acting nomination as well I don't know about a win the passage of time was very convincing and he does have some really strong emotional scenes like really like a gift to an actor even though I thought at the beginning he was hamming it up a little bit so I don't think he's a strong contender but I think he's in the mix but speaking of senior citizens the movie is set up like you're visiting grandpa the senior at the Senior Center and boy to see you have a story to tell you which is an excellent framing device it's a it's really a very clever framing device and it's very well set up but you know what's not so great choosing to have the pacing and the energy of a story that grandpa tells you I mean as I said the movie is super slow and feels super long and I actually almost dozed off I got very little sleep last night but still if it had been a really good movie I would have paid attention but I was like really fighting to stay awake towards the end of the second hour whoa I mean it really was like spending a few hours at your grandparents house because if again the pacing the energy the sex the actors it was it was it was office a little surreal in that regard and also speaking of The Godfather Part two again that's also three plus hours I recently watched it for the Labor Day weekend went down to Little Italy had some dinner then watched The Godfather Part two which has a lot of scene and seems a little italy fabulous evening and I was riveted to that movie the entire time never lost a step loved it and while this is a very long movie oddly Scorsese has made it a very small movie in scope the cinematography the locations none of it warrants the big screen in fact this could easily be a four episode streaming series on Netflix which is what it basically is also well it's a different story the movie is so similar to The Godfather films the first two and Goodfellas etc with the same actors but that also keeps them it keeps it from feeling fresh and new the movie is very funny again as I said and has some surprisingly fun turns from Steven Graham who we all know plays a very good mobster but also Ray Romano was used incredibly well here I love gray Romano here and there are some cameos really great cameos sprinkled throughout a lot of times like oh look who it is oh look look I love that person awesome now obviously in a movie like this the women's roles aren't great although Goodfellas of course had a pretty strong female role and I guess uh Diane Keaton was so annoying and the Godfather movies it's a little bit hard to include her as well but here I thought Katherine Narducci as Pesci's wife made an impression and it was nice to see dascha Polanco from orange is the new black even if it was just for one scene she stood out though good for her she made the most of it so I definitely watch the Irishman I just stream it and as I said you might might want to make it a two-night event you might be like no grace I want to power through it I'm gonna watch this whole thing in one night cuz it's a Scorsese movie damn it but I bet you you fall asleep and you'll have to watch it the next night unless you start it like speaking of senior citizens you start it like a four o'clock maybe then you could do it maybe you'd be a good after Sunday afternoon movie which is how I recommended you watch Romo by the way I watched Romo myself on a rainy Sunday I was like let's try this again because the credits were so long I'd finished my dinner one evening trying to watch it and I was like forget this so I went back on a rainy afternoon and I watched the whole thing all the way through and ice again again as I said I felt it was worth it and I would describe the Irishman the same way for both the positive and the negative so that's my review of the Irishman very curious tear your thoughts down below be sure to hit that subscribe button and of course as always you can check out some more videos right now
