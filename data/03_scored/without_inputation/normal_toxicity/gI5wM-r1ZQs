welcome back to my channel sabaidee Dyson,0.16741629
I could just start out by saying this is a ten out of ten instant classic just like I was saying to my final trailer reaction like I loved the Irishman as far as it being 3 hours and 29 minutes it does not feel like 3 hours and 29 minutes like you get every bit of what is going on and four 80s baby,0.1524602
like myself who know who Jimmy Hoffa was know the circumstances around Jimmy Hoffa this movie puts it in perspective from Frank Sheeran's point of view,0.07269989
I love it the de-aging CGI didn't bother me that much because I was just so in tune with the story you know and I feel like Joe Pesci playing Russell Bufalino Bar None deserves an Academy Award I love Robert De Niro ask Frank Sheeran I love Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa,0.067816734
I love Harvey Keitel as Don Bruno and I just feel like everyone gave a great performance but Joe Pesci is bar none the most entertaining most it kept,0.079330005
my my eyes glued to the screen every time Joe Pesci talks every time he has something to say it was just like the way he acted with people,0.13108331
I love that because you would never think by looking at someone like that that they're a Mafia don you know like,0.38691723
and just the fact that when I had you know what movies like these I do want to do my research,0.06020988
so when I saw Russell Bufalino as the Bufalino crime family and and here is depicted,0.1555976
as Russell Russell Bufalino like I'm not sure if he was a boss but it was drawing that tell playing,0.09515942
Bruno as the boss and Russell Bufalino was just kind of like a concierge and turns out that Russell Bufalino was the one that was he was the silent Donnellan he was the actual box you know I'm saying I'm just kind of like God giant like dude you a piece like if you have everyone you know just if you took a liking to you that he protected you you look out to you,0.17482111
one thing in particular that made me feel like,0.09029017
Dan you you you that dude was when Frank Sheeran bombed the laundry um kinda like the laundry house or their like the industry with for the laundry try and do that that job for that guy that was like hey you know this,0.30001345
you know it's in competition,0.092794225
so Frank made so much money and bombed the laundry Factory,0.23967348
and then he sat down with Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci and Harvick Keitel was just explaining to him like dude you know like what were you doing that for who are you doing that for and you just kinda like,0.11416323
yeah this ain't the time for you to be silent like you better,0.16935492
tell me cuz you know in in in,0.07870852
so many subtle ways,0.12895313
he's basically saying that your life depends upon it and Frank finally yeah you know the job I was doing affects your money and he was just like,0.15518583
oh yeah you know this is what I I'm sorry that I did it,0.10710008
you know I didn't mean to offend anybody you know just something I did,0.08710095
and you know Harvey Keitel is like man,0.24220005
yeah,0.040847696
I was a silent partner and today you shouldn't did it it was unauthorized,0.13852529
and just when he was saying you know do you know how good of a friend you got in Russell Bufalino and he was like friends like no,0.11776352
you don't know,0.23983517
and I was like dang and Joe Pesci just kinda like staring at him like,0.16781613
yeah,0.040847696
I just saved your life you know because you know Bruno is he wants your head for that like you know,0.31935972
Mike anybody else will get killed because you Russell's friend and Russell delight don't do it cuz,0.69542736
he didn't he really didn't know,0.07658767
he got him off the hook,0.15520747
so I was just like man,0.12464305
he was like man basically you know I would have been sent you to another family you would probably got got you like you know if it wasn't for him,0.2745396
and I'm just like damn like,0.5876557
that's the pull that Russell Bufalino had,0.11128418
and for the fact that when you fast forward when JFK got shot and at that party giving Frank Sheeran their awards and stuff like that and how Russell Bufalino was telling Frank Sheeran like man,0.31089434
if you can whack a president may you could definitely wack a union boss he ain't no problem,0.3356807
and you know here's Jimmy Hoffa Lima tango and dango do that like I'm I'm a political figure,0.06600623
you know Mike I'm in the media like you ain't gonna do that like without having a heavy scrutiny you know like and Russell's like man,0.22265083
you don't know what we capable of you know,0.31089434
and I just love that effect because even with Joey Joey Gallo I remember watching that you know the document on Joey Gallo and it was just crazy how that carried out,0.19542687
so I'm not sure if Frank was the one who really carried that hit out on crazy,0.418567
Joe Gallo but I was really enthralled with watching that documentary about Joey Gallo and how he was and I don't let that's a crazy dude boy and to say that Frank got him I'm like man you were deep in the mob and crazy enough Russell Bufalino,0.6050246
I loved how they were showing that people hey this is new Angelo though this is a Sally and it's showing how at the bottom of the screen,0.11728306
it's like,0.06409528
yeah he got shot in the head eight times you know October 26 1980 and I might you've seen all these figure that they're running into talking to people,0.5194165
and how they're getting killed you know after the event you know,0.63286835
and Russell died which is very rare for mob boss to die of natural causes basically he lived out his whole life not getting assassinated not getting contract killed nothing,0.33850253
so you knew that this dude was cool with every other Don that was in America probably even in Sicily nobody won in his head,0.3496441
he didn't he didn't crossover nobody's toes even crossover but nobody's fingers and if he had to do a contract kill,0.53490317
it was for a reason like because he that I do to be like man,0.15480405
look you know we could talk things out,0.078082815
but if you can't do that he meant business too that is major respect that was probably before the Philly mob had carmine the snake,0.14969327
I forgot his last name but I really like I said I love mob movies I love mob documentaries,0.14967312
but this was all before carmine the snake came in to Philly and made Philly a dangerous place to be fusing ma you know and like I said I run that Jimmy Hoffa time there's there's a lot of speculation to the theory of Frank sharing with a lot of other theories that who killed Jimmy Hoffa but with this this put me at ease to know what happened to Jimmy Hoffa this looks this looks and sounds a little bit more believable because who else would have got really close to Jimmy Hoffa,0.25291505
but at the same time when I looked at the documents for Jimmy Hoffa they never once mentioned and Frank Sheeran next to him many photos,0.054214943
so I don't know how true or believable,0.096721075
I feel like this is but it feels very believable just by the I heard you pay houses I love that I love that slogan I love the book,0.04776586
I haven't read it but I love it makes this makes me want to read it to understand what else,0.15049207
they were doing around that time a revolving around Frank Sharon's life and it just shows how huge is a hardened criminal and it made his daughters kind of look at him differently,0.48846355
and you could tell that he was so into the life that his his kids were like I can't you know I have no relationship with you because he's a cold-hearted killer you know,0.69542736
and Frank knew that Frank knew that,0.037692986
that's why I'm just like to live out his life the way he did he knew that the whole time right,0.13740644
you know I'm like he just was in the life,0.15798256
that's just what that's what it does to you,0.087102056
you know it's just like being in the war,0.19119163
and as he mentioned frequently endless like it's just like being that war,0.1589354
it's like you know,0.114687584
this is what it is,0.061629243
so I loved every minute of it this is like I said an instant classic I'm definitely gonna check this out again whenever it's like a year or two three years down,0.08088094
the road this is going to be instant classic and if in his shock just like Goodfellas and away you know,0.14915778
and that's why I was like him somebody's getting the wars for this Netflix got him one finally cuz then he plus was like,0.102181904
yeah we you know we only tell Netflix got them one with this definitely like I said ten out of ten I love the performances I love the dialogue it's a slow burn dialogue and I missed that and movies where it's not a lot of action,0.066346936
you don't need it,0.14863457
you just need to pay attention to the dialogue into the story like you have to pay attention to understand the next scene I've missed that in movies and this movie carried it out to perfection awesome tacular if you're Jeremy Jones fan Chris tuck me a plus five out of five wolves if you a title magnets fan this is it this is it,0.09755707
