if this is your first time here welcome,0.0759814
I hope you like what you hear we're gonna be talking about a fun,0.11337886
comedy today called book smart,0.24131759
it's the directorial debut of Olivia Wilde two stars Kaitlyn Dever and beanie Feldstein the story follows two high school friends that have spent the last four years relentlessly hitting the books while others were going to parties and seemingly working much less than they were in realizing that they could have potentially missed out on some of the fun that their peers have been having over,0.08236879
the last four years,0.052632563
the two of them tried to catch up on all of it by having one wild and memorable night of partying on the eve of their graduation,0.15973271
no I'm not gonna lie to you from what the trailer showed me of this one I've appeared to be another rather formulaic high school comedy with some strong emotional undertones to it it did look like it has some potential though because the trailers made me laugh and despite being many many years out of high school,0.1728843
I was actually interested in what this cast could deliver and much more,0.04209085
so what Olivia Wilde could pull off from behind the camera,0.2635554
and I think much to my delight this film delivered much more than a simple teenage story of growth into the adult world that was a heartwarming coming-of-age story but it also just blended in a charming sense of humor with everything with some sincere emotional arcs and a great musical score that routinely was able to pump a lot of energy into the atmosphere of the narrative on top of all that it was a successful female buddy comedy that I thought thrived from the performances of devaron Feldstein the script was extremely well written,0.07197533
but it was the delivery of the material and the chemistry between these actresses that I thought created genuine characters I felt were just impossible not to connect with they captured that pure friendship with ease and it resulted in some effective laughs that had me thinking back to my high school days,0.066100806
I was able to just really see myself inside of these characters within a few minutes of their screen time their routine and going to school was much different than my best friend,0.06881674
and what we had the music may have been different as well but the dynamic we had it was very much our own like it was for these two girls and it had me completely invested in just the authenticity of everything the script weaves solid arcs for both characters individually but it also showed a strong focus on the growth of their friendship overall which is this,0.052712247
what really had me completely engaged in where this story is gonna take not only them,0.104522295
but their friendship,0.08962838
I mean this film honestly does have a collection of scenes that felt very familiar to a lot of other movies in the genre yet I have to say with devaron Feldstein creating such extremely likeable characters it was still very much intriguing to see them progress through these scenes regardless I think the writing was really able to just hit all the emotional beats with near perfect timing when it needed to be lighting comical about the situations and the dialogue delivered,0.117440656
and when it needed to be serious and more dramatic the turn felt very natural and smooth as the story arcs in the various character and relationship dynamics took over and everything complemented each other very well I thought it was also able to feel very comfortable and capable in a realistically crass high school setting without ever losing,0.08684559
its sincerity,0.07276444
there certainly are some crude situations,0.03640611
and some jokes that earn this movie it's our rating however they never felt placed in to simply be raunchy for Raji's,0.080766834
sake,0.061981987
I mean things are gonna get vulgar and stories centering around teenagers because at that age we often were I mean unless I went to the wrong high school sex parties drugs and alcohol are all things that many teenagers are exposed to,0.30281368
and this story really captured those elements with that realistic approach that kept it from just simply feeling like shock value humor,0.050277
it really complimented that comedic tone by exploring other social elements that teenagers must go through which gave everything much more heart,0.053377397
I think Olivia Wilde's direction was skillful in her debut it's clear to me that she understood the tone and the intention of this story about she did a great job of manoeuvring the characters to capture the right emotion and level of intensity during many different scenes I really thought she let the performances shine by just holding the frame of the shop or longer periods during the more emotionally driven scenes and then as the night progresses in the level of craziness elevates I think Wilde really infused it with a vibrant and crisp artistic style and overall what she did was subtle,0.110153414
but she accomplished things behind,0.18682007
the lens that just blended smoothly with the tone of the story when the narrative was calm camera techniques felt much more simplistic and then as drugs and alcohol and action makes its way in the story I thought wild was really able to switch up the techniques and the angles to just show a skillful eye in creating her vision for this story another strong positive for me with this,0.071095854
one was the supporting cast,0.05673474
I thought there were a variety of side characters throughout the storylines who just continually keep things feeling fresh in terms of personality types and angles of humor and jason sudeikis lisa kudrow and Will Forte all provide some charm in small doses with a collection of younger characters as well like Skylar ghazan doe Billie lourd and Noah Gavin all bringing some life to some otherwise routine character types that I thought were all able at different times to provide some laughs everything in this movie to me just felt right nothing really took over the focus of being on these two friends and all the other elements felt like just perfect side dishes to everything it's very heartwarming without feeling sappy,0.09046399
and it's because nothing just felt overly forced so overall,0.09092783
I really enjoyed this movie and I'm surprisingly enough gonna have to give book-smart 90% on the entertainment meter drawbacks in this movie would be minor like,0.087829
I said I haven't been to high school in a long time,0.15175004
so I couldn't tell you how realistic or unrealistic some of the character types in this movie were but for the needs of the story,0.05232651
I thought they all worked for providing a variety of different personalities,0.06442252
I mean the movie does follow some genre tropes the progression of the plotline is one that you can sort of forecast and some of the humor does not hit with the intended impact,0.056261092
but I don't think any comedy is gonna go out there and deliver a perfect string of laughs,0.18920979
so in this instance I think much much more of the humor work than what didn't so when all that was paired with the more dramatic elements of the story,0.05381308
the result was honestly just an endearing coming-of-age movie with two lead characters that felt very genuine and down-to-earth that can make this genre film appeal to a mass audience,0.060647465
