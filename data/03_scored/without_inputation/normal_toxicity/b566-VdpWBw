hey everyone today,0.047740776
I've got your spotlight movie review a Boston news paper investigates a an abuse scandal within the Catholic Church,0.31089434
so how much of the truth will the spotlight team uncover as far as the story goes Tom McCarthy directs,0.04658873
this gripping post-911 story that really digs deep into a ten-year cover-up by the church that a local boston paper wants to make public because clearly this is an important issue that nobody seems to want to have out in the open,0.18094636
there's just so much going on in this movie and there are situations where you literally have these reporters jumping through,0.09648103
all these obstacles along the way just to take this scandal ultimately to the courts and having to interview several people several people to come out and eventually some of them will admit about what went on in the church,0.13821337
so I really find that whole thing interesting as well as the entire story because it does seem like you hear a lot about this in the news in general as far as the casting goes,0.06617639
you have a huge ensemble cast it's already gaining a lot of recognition for being in this movie,0.09987677
you've,
got Mark Ruffalo who stars and he at first sort of comes off as this guy who kind of gets on peoples nerves yet he is really hard hitting and he knows what he wants to get,0.360547
so he's like that that kind of reporter,0.1365252
no I really like him as an actor in this movie pretty awesome,0.13348587
Michael Keaton who I think really shines in this movie playing the sort of leader role in the film and it's really cool to see his interactions with his coworker trying to make sure that this story gets told and things just get done,0.10135629
Rachel McAdams who actually really admire in this movie as being a the basically only female lead in this movie,0.19052504
and I think she does a really good job at also selling her character as far as her being the one to really go around town,0.11218809
and she you know doesn't care if somebody tries to slam a door in her face whether you know when she's trying to get an interview get a statement from people she's not going to try and get frustrated but she's just trying to be one of the best in the business minor roles in this movie by Liam Schreiber who I think is another really good actor in this movie and he's kind of almost playing chameleon in this role,0.24241497
got Stanley Tucci who sort of who doesn't even play one of the journalists he plays sort of like one of those legal guys and you know I wouldn't want to see him take me to court,0.11598195
because you know he is the one that's trying to tell mark ruffalo at one point no like there's some sealed documents and you gotta get them on time for me,0.1523888
if you want them otherwise phone public you know that whole ordeal was just crazy things that I did like about this movie it's very rare for me to feel connected to a film like this that touches upon such a subject that is in the news today,0.15428108
and it clearly has affected several people,0.06488327
so I mean it's really cool that they even came out with a movie like this because it also resembles some other movies out there,0.0799179
but I feel like this is one of the best of the film that have this type of genre this news drama film really has you engaged from start to finish because of all this depth and the secrecy and controversy that was going on within the church,0.1008708
so I feel like this movie he never loses its traction and really turns out to become this huge compelling story that I might actually grow to love so overall I would say that spotlight definitely does shine and I think it's a very important film for people to see and it definitely has that subject matter that people are definitely going to be interested in,0.08099339
so i would highly recommend seeing this movie i think it is one of the best of 2015 go see this film if you have not and i would give this 5 hearts on the heart rate scale,0.23889038
