a very different film but it has similarities in terms of it being a period,0.017021384
piece that's very comparable to this as well as it being higher level elegance and,0.056820653
an attention to the smallest of sound details and i'm a big fan of small,0.036790643
details even more than i am of big details i love bombast i love massive,0.041839387
uh visual effects of all kinds whether they be makeup or cgi but i'm a,0.053863246
big fan of small small things in cinema and the smallness of things that are,0.04652361
captured in this that help convey the story in the most profound of ways it's,0.016601654
just like in phantom thread where there are moments where you need to have things,0.07984266
so quiet that you can hear the needle and thread going through the fabric you,0.0384097
need to hear the wooden spoon tapping on the bottom of the pan and the,0.07900785

it's writing on the page you need to hear the wind blowing in the trees,0.07738813
this film is that kind of a film and the writing like everything else in,0.020903395
the film is top notch that acting from our two leading ladies and all of,0.015855983
the supporting ladies absolutely top notch i added this movie to my list of not,0.045231823
only favorite films of all time but this one's gonna stay with me for the,0.026496924
rest of my life not only for the artistic reasons i've just talked to you,0.14483908
about but because of some of the things i'm about to talk about when we,0.024766782
get into the more spoiler side of things for those of you who've seen the,0.06366739
film this this film is probably going to remain in my top 10 favorite motion,0.04123008
pictures of all time i cannot wait to watch this film with my children and,0.2172084
particularly with my daughters and i feel a level of total disqualification to talk about,0.095449865
the messages of the film for two reasons number one is it's definitively a woman,0.060904216
film at every level not just because it was created by in the writing and,0.032659188
the directing and then the cast and crew driven by women but because i i,0.27447784
only look at that as an outsider i can only sympathize with what a woman,0.1494854
goes through i cannot empathize and i feel that i not only have a disqualification,0.07741274
in that regard i feel like i have a disqualification in regard to articulating it,0.035124358
in any way that's better than the film itself it's one of the rare films,0.030417517
that i feel like i don't have much to say about it other than i,0.039161358
love it and it's so magnificent and i can point out some things but the,0.035036553
deeper issues it talks about that are the world and the life of a woman,0.16644824
there's nothing i can say the film doesn't say for itself you know the old,0.027531287
phrase a picture's worth a thousand words a movie's worth 10 million i wish everyone,0.034618817
had seen this film and i i simply cannot believe that this film was not,0.07281233
nominated and paid attention to i can't imagine academy members saw this film and did,0.022804491
not jump up and down and it was it was screened at the cannes film,0.08569694
festival so i really would like to know what it is that caused people to,0.10539769
not pay attention to this film how corbin and i miss this film and i'm,0.06531438
so excited that this is the first film that we're jumping into it was the,0.0611204
first reaction i did and it's the first review that i'm doing and it makes,0.031795114
me so happy because if this is a harbinger of things to come we are,0.07594801
in for the kind of magnificent life-changing and enriching ride i knew we would get,0.08255328
into when adroni and i started talking about this and i was losing sleep over,0.08457078
it because this is what movies are supposed to be this kind of a film,0.053541962
so for those of you who haven't seen the film leave now please and go,0.022429327
watch it and then come back because i'm now getting it again some some spoilers,0.061264746
and moments of the film that are specific so this is it my mantra is,0.0137706315
let the movie tell the story if you haven't seen the movie go watch it,0.024406252
and then come back and pick up right here look at the time stamp see,0.030329714
where you are you can pick it up right here and then join us for,0.02770756
the rest of this spoiler time that final moment when she's sitting there listening to,0.037592188
the song and you you do know i hope you all picked up on the,0.09735029
fact that the song that eloise is listening to is the exact same song that,0.031445228
marianne played for her on the harpsichord and that moment where celine stiama is allowing,0.029203558
the camera to just sit on eloise and let her go through all of the,0.07991583
emotions in that moment that you know what it is she's thinking about and feeling,0.03376339
about it's it's a perfect ending to what is in my opinion a perfect film,0.15979308
that moment is you feel everything that she's feeling in that moment and to just,0.031956088
let the camera sit on her and let the actress be in that moment and,0.2131601
let us feel everything with her immediately following a moment that really set the table,0.026769651
for it the emotional profundity of that moment was really predicated on obviously the whole,0.03628577
film prior but that moment where marianne is in the art gallery and she walks,0.021801393
up and she sees the painting and she's not only getting to see eloise again,0.0442693
but she looks down and sees that eloise has a little girl and then she,0.21575697
looks at the book and she looks at the hands and then she sees the,0.029548123
page has been opened to page 28. i don't know about you but that that,0.06357626
made me cry and then i was just buckets of tears at the end when,0.04254847
she's listening to that orchestra and you do realize and it's one of the reasons,0.10033963
i recommended watching it and making sure you hear every little nuance of sound is,0.02667586
there is no score until an hour and 15 minutes and it is so powerful,0.04622095
and so magnificent that this woman-centric film has as its first expression of music nothing,0.14028125
but women's voices that just start to rise at this fire and then go into,0.32507166
that beautiful song and after you haven't heard any music to have the musical thing,0.025204474
that hits you be just the voices of women it's there's nothing i can say,0.29163262
that it didn't say itself it's so profound it's so powerful it's so beautiful and,0.025258353
the symbolism and the double meanings triple meanings of the title portrait of a lady,0.05060052
on fire which lady both ladies the first time we actually see physical fire is,0.18808001
when marianne is looking at the picture of eloise that has no face on it,0.061514188
and she's looking at it and she gets the candle too close to the canvas,0.091755435
and it ignites and it ignites right where her right where the heart is on,0.09216385
eloise i really wish i i read some things about the film i really wish,0.045080163
this movie wasn't uh categorized or set off to the side as a lesbian film,0.16687861
or a gay film there's so many people who won't see this film because they'll,0.31371748
avoid it because it's been called the lesbian film don't tell people that's what it,0.22620665
is tell them what it is it's a love story and leave it alone and,0.031872276
let it be what it is and it's more than a love story this film,0.05797142
is from my uh personal opinion i can't think of a film that for me,0.055176985
is a more extraordinarily powerful film to point out and go you want to see,0.078511626
a movie about women right there and you want to see it done in a,0.08551402
way that's so masterful that you're going to be left indelibly imprinted for the rest,0.04350168
of your life if you don't feel that way after seeing the film i truly,0.11060674
don't understand other than there's something else going on in terms of attention deficit or,0.01180701
it's just really not your cup of tea to sit and watch a sunset things,0.11398055
that have a pace that hearken back to times that were not as frenetic and,0.048440002
frenzied as today which has been for the most of the history of the world,0.0377505
that you don't that you prefer driving through fast food restaurants rather than sitting down,0.029188259
to a nice meal and enjoying a cup of wine you'd rather down some shots,0.19128087

of that nature but man you give me the slow burns every day you give,0.262987
