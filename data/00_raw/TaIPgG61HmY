logan is directed by james mangold and is the final portrayal of wolverine by hugh jackman or so he says james mangold last directed the wolverine which i thought was pretty good up until the third act which got really silly but up until then I was like yes this is what I need and if you watch the extended cut of the Wolverine it's even better so I was happy that James Mangold was returning to direct this final portrayal of such an iconic character I'm going to go very light on the plot synopsis because I got to see this very early at a press screening and basically Logan has to cart this girl around he's not entirely sure what her backstory is and as he learns more about it he learns more about himself as well so as Wolverine is slicing and dicing various bad guys he and Professor X have to try to protect this girl who may not really need that much protection because she's got some tricks up her sleeve this is also the first movie featuring Wolverine to be rated R this film is brutal oh my god there is so much blood and limbs I loved it they really didn't hold anything back Wolverine goes absolutely berserk on people in this movie he's chopping off limbs he's impaling people and it's not squeaky clean there's blood everywhere and my god it's [ __ ] great from an action standpoint this is probably my favorite in the x-men universe not just because of the fact that it doesn't hold back but because Wolverine is old he's tired he's broken down he's beaten physically and emotionally he's doing back-alley drug deals to get pills for Professor X I mean this guy is just a complete shadow of what he used to be so when someone comes around challenging him it's amazing to see that old Wolverine come out that insane Weapon X that we've come to love in other movies really come to fruition again when just the right buttons are pushed and this is something that I expected going in knowing that it's rated R knowing that rating says strong brutal bloody violence that's what I want to see and we do get that but from an emotional standpoint I was very satisfied with Logan in regards to the fact this is more in line with what Christopher Nolan did with Batman less of what we've seen with the Avengers Marvel movies this is a very somber serious drama that contains exciting bursts of action throughout this isn't a movie where our heroes walk around sad and depressed the entire time it's not completely devoid of humor it has a lot of fun in there as well and some good jokes but it is kept at a very gracious minimum this is a dark violent movie in which very little hope remains for these characters they're at about 99.9% done with hope there is a very tiny little shred of it remaining in these characters eyes it is so great and riveting to see these characters we've grown to love put in a place that's so dark and so small and almost completely forgotten about that you just want to see them climb out of the hole they're in and watching these characters especially the young girl in the film grow to appreciate one another and learn to help each other again and be heroes again it was fantastic this movie makes the curious choice of having the x-men comics physically exist in this world and they're viewed as these fictional stories that people wrote based off of the real heroes so Wolverine picks up an x-men comic and looks through a Yaz's bullsháá and throws it away you know that's actually really smart I love that because it takes place in the future of the timeline established in Days of Future past so you can do a lot with what took place in between those two films and apparently a lot of people are very happy with the x-men and view them as heroes and so there's comic books that exist in this world about them and it's really actually a very smart and fresh idea and I like the fact that include that in there I would say the first act and the third act of this movie are the best those two acts are extremely riveting very fast paced intense they almost feel like westerns there's a definite Western sense to this movie that James Mangold is going for even right down to a scene where the characters are watching the movie Shane on TV but the second act turns into a roadtrip movie of sorts and it meanders a little bit nothing from a dramatic standpoint that's very interesting is happening there also wasn't a lot of action for that period that act was really taken to make the little girl and Wolverine grow as characters and it wasn't quite as interesting as I think it could have been the film sometimes chooses to focus on characters that are nowhere near as compelling as the ones that we want it to focus on it sometimes takes way too much time with other characters that I feel don't really have that much weight or impact to this movie the film also makes another interesting choice for the characters that to my knowledge has no basis in the comics I believe the writers have completely invented this character for some it might be a distraction gratefully it's handled pretty well it's actually kind of scary what they do with a specific character in this film that to my knowledge as I said is completely invented by the screenwriters his addition in this movie is fairly miniscule but some are probably going to be annoyed by it because it's sort of invented again I've read a lot of x-men comics but I haven't read all of them so if I'm wrong I'm wrong but I think he mostly worked for this movie and I think that if fans can accept the fact that not everything in these movies has to be perfectly like the comics and that these are adaptations of the comics and I think most men will be ok with it especially since it's brutal and kind of terrifying actually now of course no spoilers but as for the way everything wraps up in this movie I found it to be pretty satisfying I did want just a little bit more emotionally just maybe a couple more little punches to my gut but for the most part everything ended in a way that I think is very satisfactory for longtime fans and for myself in particular it's not a perfect movie sometimes the tone and the pacing of it all gets a little jumbled but as a final portrayal of this character Hugh Jackman was just so [ __ ] badass he knocked it out of the park once again for one last time seeing our beloved will be so broken and learning about his past some things he maybe didn't even want to know about it was kind of heart-wrenching and he did a fantastic job Patrick Stewart is also amazing in this movie I love the little girl as well I thought she was very good James Mangold's vision for this movie is very beautiful I think it's a very good-looking movie very well edited I liked Logan quite a bit I'm going to give it an A -
