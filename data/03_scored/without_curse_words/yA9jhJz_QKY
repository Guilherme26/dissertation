a lot of social commentary and I really enjoyed that vibe that that movie gave,0.06056901
me but with the film us it's more of the classic throwback to a home-invasion,0.08377577
horror film that references home alone at one point and for me that's the movie,0.14149071
I wanted to see the movie starts out in 1986 were the events that a,0.035767455
young girl goes through carry on to present-day now on a quick side note the,0.14948724
majority of this movie takes place at this boardwalk location at the Santa Cruz Beach,0.08818127
and it reminded me of another 1980s horror film that has the same setting it's,0.08045311

right here I kept thinking about this when watching this film just yeah don't get,0.09682946

film get out this film was also written and directed by Jordan Peele and my,0.06756574
favorite thing that he does as a writer and director is he knows how to,0.07872869
blend comedy and perfectly together those two genres typically when you make a movie that,0.1011557
has a lot of comedy are scary suspense in it they don't know how to,0.15226574
balance those two things cohesively and sometimes it goes too far one direction and sometimes,0.05190009
it's not scary sometimes it's so funny it takes you out of the the suspense,0.17376961
of the film but when it comes to Jordan Peele as a director and writer,0.040167876
he does this and it's amazing because he can have you laughing your ass off,0.9017428
or have you on the edge of your seat in the next scene and then,0.14960308
laughing again just a few seconds later and never once does either see and counterbalance,0.11495703
each other to where it takes you out of the movie no one comes to,0.19978689
the acting and performances throughout this film it pretty much follows this family but the,0.035225928
main character of the entire film is the mother of the family played by Anna,0.053138353
Peeta and young go and her performance as this character as a smother was very,0.25501093
convincing but she also has a dual role throughout the film and it's creepy as,0.12568757
it goes something like that but I really enjoyed it and that same thing goes,0.09452295
for every actor throughout this film they all have a dual role and they play,0.050477557
evil versions of themselves now let's talk about the comedy aspect of this film and,0.31219882
before I do that I first have to talk about the father in the film,0.055531323
played by Winston Duke who is more or less the comedic relief of the entire,0.19508637
film and at first he's almost a little too comedic he sort of comes across,0.09590149
as obnoxious but then you learn to love this guy and some of the one-liners,0.42923295
he says even in terrifying suspenseful situations you still laugh and then you get right,0.14859253
back into the sea now no worries no spoilers I wouldn't spoil anything for you,0.10064614
I hate that we have to say that in YouTube videos because if I'm going,0.31984565
to spoil anything for you I'll put spoilers and big capital titles on the title,0.15395051
of the video but anyway one of my favorite scenes in this film was a,0.06011297
home invasion scene and it's bloody and it's gory and it's over-the-top and in the,0.42956197
background there playing NWA and it's it's a thing of beauty it's the sort of,0.040468298
scene I wanted to see in a movie like this and I got it and,0.094745055
speaking of music the score to this movie is amazing it's eerie at times but,0.07665606
it also has the ability to make songs like I got five on it terrifying,0.11398846
to listen to during the climax of the movie and I really enjoy that I,0.09024001
love when a film can take something that's everyday and you never think of it,0.14923386
as terrifying and it can do that and now I'll never listen to that song,0.11453784
the same way again I know it sounds like I'm praised in this film and,0.06809822
maybe I am but I do have some big negatives especially with the ending to,0.10654043
the film I'm going to talk about in just one second but first I want,0.07187724
to say from a comedic element from a horror genre element those two things were,0.10742087
blended perfectly in this movie I can't praise them enough and from a visual standpoint,0.09217126
of being terrified because this is a horror film first and then a comedy movie,0.18934232
second the opening shot to this movie where he had this little girl walking down,0.45502225
the boardwalk and you sort of have this feeling that something Bad's about to happen,0.18642083
and she's walking into the darkness this abyss where she's walking to the end of,0.15764582
the boardwalk and down below you can see the sand and the beach sent chills,0.14208677
down my arms because you could just feel something bad was about to happen and,0.24411336
I loved that like that scene still sticks with me and gives me a little,0.2328162
goosebumps stay on my arm as I talk about it right now so from a,0.1604419
visual standpoint I really enjoyed the way that this film looked because you got immersed,0.12772274
into these environments you got to see those lurking dark shadowy figures in the background,0.24087423
but you also got to see everything that was going on this is a modern-day,0.08507777
horror film that doesn't feel like a modern-day horror film which is the biggest praise,0.15076534
I can really say about this film because it doesn't feel like a big bloated,0.089997776
CG mess with screaming faces and loud sounds every time someone turns around this movie's,0.24088311
nothing like the twenty last terrible horror films I watched of this year and last,0.18196324
year now listen wreck this entire film I was along for the ride I was,0.11175905
enjoying everything I was getting but in the back of my mind I was thinking,0.22487314
okay please by the end of this movie just give me an explanation I can,0.10345326
live with and and somehow makes sense for everything happening and do they explain everything,0.050515044
at the end of this film yeah they explain it they almost overly explain it,0.06795994
because when you're watching a movie like this just give me a slight explanation and,0.105423935
I'll leave the theater happy with my stale popcorn a sour patch kids in my,0.31089434
pocket but I never take the drink because the Ice Cube's melt and I just,0.12395601
yeah warm diet soda tastes like but once again when a movie tries to overly,0.07179059
explain itself you start asking yourself too many questions and all I'm saying is I,0.15436041
feel like maybe they should have made the explanation a little bit more vague and,0.17435068
small-scale and I would have bought into it a little bit more but hang on,0.31169727
there's there's more that's not even my biggest issue with this film because at the,0.0947849
very end of the film after they explained how these events came to be they,0.040326837
throw a twist into the movie and that twist is a little too on-the-nose because,0.16851366
they could have been a bit more ambiguous with it but they just blatantly tell,0.15030296
you exactly what's happening and I was hoping for something more along the lines that,0.062723756
we got in Inception leave it up for a debate make us go watch the,0.09900265
movie five times and make us have arguments on the internet for five years to,0.049648304
come to talk about ok did that really happen did that really happen and none,0.067997195
of those things will happen now because the movie blatantly tells you now here are,0.10718683
my final flicking thoughts in the film us I really enjoyed this film it was,0.046756055
refreshing it gave me all these different elements combined into one movie and it did,0.090168186
them all so perfectly except for the last 5 minutes of the movie but this,0.09476614
is an ambitious film this is a different film this is the sort of film,0.10694333
I think we should get more of and I appreciate that and I think Jordan,0.038467526
Peele is a director and writer I can't wait to see what he does next,0.08450218
I will say as far as a horror film goes the film us definitely fits,0.17576014
the category more than the film get out did and I really enjoyed this film,0.06434919
I think you guys should definitely check it out I'm going to give the film,0.08354765
us solid B go check out the movie it's a good time now here's my,0.13104232
question for you and let me know down below who would you say your doppelganger,0.36158034
is if I had to pick one well yeah I know I just ruined Scarlett,0.15402333
Johansson for you I'm sorry and my other question to you is what did you,0.19258079
think about the movie let me know that down below in the comments as always,0.12741065
