second directed film from Jordan Peele called us starring Lupita Nyong'o Winston Duke Evan Alex,0.07328687
Shahadah right Joseph the story and this one follows a family that's on vacation that,0.083277486
in defining themselves being terrorized by the demented doppelgangers now it certainly isn't easy to,0.40319633
follow up a massive critical success in a directorial debut with another movie that accomplishes,0.05856638
the same if not more feats than that one but I think that could be,0.08141566
what Jordan Peele is sitting on with this movie because simply put I thought this,0.11457438
movie was awesome it was creepy it was intelligent it was just twisted and loads,0.2914623
of fun it was a perfect blend of horror and psychological thriller with dark comedy,0.25784755
and together these elements just really fit nicely into one fluid narrative that took me,0.10938426
on a very haunting ride with endless amounts of sinister appeal I think the plotline,0.17603275
in concept is very grounded it isn't hard to put yourself in the position of,0.06588535
this family to imagine what you would really do in their situation I thought it,0.09171262
was just absolutely compelling to see how things unfolded the first act in particular the,0.056079265
opening scene do a great job of setting the stage for this plotline it gives,0.06638923
us this section of a flashback for this haunting night with this little girl it,0.4891346
gives the viewer something to think about in the back of their mind as the,0.16300564
tone then shifts to meeting the seemingly normal family the dynamics between them are all,0.089523934
common to many other families their personalities were as well which I thought just made,0.043928314
them very easy to connect with the dialogue was naturally charming with a great sense,0.07062808
of humor it landed some solid laughs to keep me entertained and as things kind,0.1714056
of built up but all the while you can just feel that something very dark,0.07221525
and looming is foreboding in the backdrop of the story I thought it was very,0.06475769
effective in creating subtle uneasiness and I was constantly on edge waiting for something dark,0.11745804
to happen despite the atmosphere of the movie early on being kind of light and,0.056215614
I enjoyed the contrast between both feelings it doesn't take long to learn enough about,0.102181986
the characters to get a sense of they were and how their family dynamics were,0.03984403
all structured then the story really does take a turn the mood drops into a,0.08294201
much darker territory the atmosphere instantly switches to that of being very ominous as the,0.1009189
family's tethered twins make their appearance and from that minute the tension really does shoot,0.40808058
up and it doesn't waver for the rest of the runtime the scenes that progress,0.060121242
from there where I thought equally as frightening as they were just steeped in a,0.1741066
lot of just natural curiosity as to what was actually happening and I thought that,0.033494584
is where Pele really shined with his writing and his direction by weaving a story,0.04608345
that was just very haunting and eerie but at the same time thought-provoking and honestly,0.047956847
fascinating it was unpredictable and it took some appealing terms during the progression it created,0.057432387
some suspenseful home invasion sequences as well as some just pier flights for survival the,0.102879
character tropes are all at first kind of delivered and a seemingly routine package but,0.06524527
I thought throughout this story their arcs were swapped up just enough to create some,0.07978031
fun certain members of the family I relied on four things to keep them all,0.1884604
alive and it was kind of a breath of fresh air to see some of,0.08379364
the character tropes switched up a bit this added a ton of enjoyment to the,0.07242634
already unique premise and it gave just the entire film a fresh vibe to it,0.053295646
and I don't want to go into a lot of spoilers by speaking too much,0.10376718
on the doppelgangers in this movie but I will say that the concept and then,0.090420134
on paper was absolutely inventive they fit perfectly into the story to hit with pure,0.19225955
frightening impact and it could not have been done without the excellent cast performances all,0.08924077
the headlining actors had to play basically two versions of the roles that they took,0.07513815
on and I thought each one of them knocked it out of the park with,0.24294378
their performances I thought Lupita Nyong'o was amazing she captured both sides of her role,0.08566739
to absolute perfection as this normal mother protecting her kids I thought she capably hit,0.32492793
all the emotion and intensity needed to just root for her success and then as,0.059551813
her dark and twisted twin she was even better with a haunting performance that I,0.69542736
think is award worthy I think she made this movie she was eerie and unpredictable,0.31209517
and just what this story needed to create just a great demented protagonist the easily,0.31227002
the other bright spots in the cast were the performances of young Evan Alex and,0.036100347
Shahadah right Joseph I thought these roles really required a lot of range from them,0.08016467
and it was a pressive to see both of them pull off every needed angle,0.10116378
of these characters I thought Jordan peels Direction was excellent it was an artistic it,0.07585516
was ambitious I think he showed a very inspired eye behind the camera to really,0.072383985
craft a fantastic horror film the production design and his methodical camerawork really blended together,0.10343815
with a strong use of lighting in the movie and different angles to really build,0.072037704
imposing scenes without the need for the usual jump scares I think in this movie,0.10055962
the horror was in the writing just as much as it was in the visual,0.15900555
appeal and together the result was a success it really plants the seeds for some,0.057629954
ideas early on and then the final act it explores these concepts more to create,0.11759874
just a world of thought I will be honest and say I think some of,0.088839084
these layers could have been built a little sooner in the film but it was,0.06378996
still well structured enough in the closing act to not feel rushed but it was,0.102000184
very close despite that though I'm still gonna give us a solid 90 percent on,0.047934454
the entertainment meter I had a great time during this movie it was very entertaining,0.07175682
it was a blend of genres but the focus was always on the horror it,0.10597038
was a movie that really did a good job of making you think about the,0.08882683
big picture of the storylines actual setting the second act did linger just a little,0.076251365
bit but it was very minor also some of the attempts at humor kind of,0.08689099
just felt missed timed but I would have to say nothing to the extent of,0.051040262
being distracting because I think everything else in this movie shined it was filled with,0.08435957
natural characters that were able to really accomplish pulling off evil versions of themselves and,0.16364065
with Jordan Peele riding and directing the tone of the story never lost its intention,0.08702394
of just being subtly horrific and it accomplishes that thank you guys so much for,0.108253226
