Dewinter Maxim's first wife who was drowned in a boating accident you know so is presumed drowned in a boating accident now shows up and mrs danvers the housekeeper you know tries to hide him from the new mrs de winter you know maximum current one second and kurt point and everything and you know the guy runs into her innocence the new business door 14 anyway you know after he leads the guy leaves the new mrs. Dewinter very bluntly tells and stampers like look you know I want to forget this whole thing happens but you know you try anything else funny I will definitely tell maxim about this and it was very just you know like she's starting to you know assert herself towards mrs. Danvers and mrs danvers was in love with Rebecca the original the first mrs. david mrs de winter and you know just all the time mrs danvers was telling the new mrs. Torrance her about the new mrs. de winter sports and you know Rebecca never you know did this before this and you know the does this way and on and on and on and on endlessly you know and what Lions have happening is you know eventually they have a costume ball well what ends up happening at the cost of all is the new mrs. de winter inadvertently wears a costume that Rebecca had worn the previous year to the last man full unknowingly and when maximum sees what his wife has on he yells at her tell her just go back upstairs put anything else on look at that outfit off per person you know when the new mrs. Dewinter realizes he's mad you know she was running upstairs she actually you know sees mrs danvers going into the wing where rebecca had lived and what in its face in the ocean and what is have happen is the new mrs. Dewinter tells mrs danvers you knew Rebecca wore this last year why didn't you tell me and it's like the senator says you think you can take her place and take the things that were hers but you know she wasn't she wasn't the kind of person that could be defeated you know she was defeated in the end it wasn't by a man it wasn't by a woman let's buy the CD and you know that's just mrs danvers it's just like this really creepy old lady you know and it's just yeah i mean and there's a matter of fact sir mrs danvers right there I mean it's you know and it's just creepy and a matter of fact that's right in the scene where I'm talking about you know and they're like going in and seeing if are showing and then seeing the you know that room that Rebecca limped in or stayed in but you know it just oh my goodness this movie is like incredible I won't ruin the ending you know because then you're like oh my god you know and it's like and I will say this though at the end they do reveal what actually did happen to Rebecca so if you want to know how the movie in you have to get the movie and watch it but I do highly recommend this movie here if you want to watch a good old Alfred Hitchcock movie this movie is 130 minutes it is inaugurated of course this was back before they had those readings and everything up this way that would say if it was made like you know today for example I say it would probably probably be either a PG or pg-13 but a pg-13 tells a little more accurate because it's you know a little bit more thematic you know as far as late you know some of the stuff that's said on there yeah it's a little more adult content but you know they can of course you know water it down some but anyway I want to thank you guys for watching I have some more movie reviews to do and you know we'll get talking about those ok hang on
