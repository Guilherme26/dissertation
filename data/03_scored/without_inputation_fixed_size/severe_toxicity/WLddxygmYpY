so the modern horror genre actually kicked off with medical living-dead which featured a black,0.2874342
lead but then the genre quickly switched to white female leads so I find it,0.17484751
absolutely fascinating that Jordan Peele has taken inspiration from some of those female centric horror,0.2541864
films that comment on misogyny I mean I guess in some degree they all kind,0.09001265
of comment on misogyny but still you know Rosemary's Baby The Stepford Wives they took,0.04634268
it to the next level and Peele has said that those were direct inspirations for,0.0275692
making get out so he built on those took the horror genre full circle with,0.055590063
a commentary on race relations it's pretty impressive like like is the thesis statement you're,0.1244685
just blown away as that you can see where all the critics all the media,0.08365283
rocking a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes it was really well positioned to go into,0.072194375
the weekend but like many thesis statements while it's easy to wow well not easy,0.015379711
but it's easier to Wow right out of the gate it's harder to bring it,0.027811993
on home you know that pesky third act and I think that's what really trips,0.026534176
peel up I think that it's weak and doesn't work and holds back the film,0.03699951
from being a classic on the level of Rosemary's Baby or Stepford Wives but still,0.035325244
overall very positive development for the horror genre how different ethnicities are represented in film,0.06962344
and everyone involved with this production so on that note oh we just said that,0.03523478
I am absolutely thrilled for peel and its cast their talent is being recognized not,0.035854064
just by you know black audiences but this movie has crossover appeal my theatre when,0.15538357
I went on Saturday night I was traveling in Los Angeles for the Oscars Dolby,0.02120938
flew me out there to go behind the scenes that's why I'm late reviewing this,0.057002246
but my theatre was 5050 in terms of the demographics that attended and that's reflected,0.01358438
actually in polling for the film it was it because you're taking also Asian viewers,0.07548903
and Latino viewers in to account it was about like mid-30s for both african-american and,0.093182914
Caucasian audiences so that's spectacular especially because you're talking about a film with a black,0.26263455
unknown lead you know it's not Denzel it's not Will Smith and also a first-time,0.025011571
director in the genre who also happens to be black to have that kind of,0.04717815
crossover appeal it's been very difficult in Hollywood to achieve that so that right there,0.03781436
you know is something that Peele can be proud of and he has definitely has,0.01088174
something to say I think the intellectual approach helped him and you also clearly loves,0.016118065
the genre but everybody was listening and that's just so spectacular and I think that,0.026647257
well again this won't become a horror classic and we'll discuss the ending at the,0.062236577
end of this review in the spoiler section but I think this will serve as,0.03582945
a launchpad particularly for Peale and his star Daniel kuya I want to make sure,0.12344212
I pronounce his name correctly now I want to start off with Pele as a,0.168499
director he's been stuck in Keith's shadow for quite some time I felt bad for,0.05299385
him but I do think the key is the superior on-camera talent there's just there's,0.0496074
an energy there but the seat pealed breakout a Keith shadow by going behind the,0.027694255
camera I think it just shows you how important is to be able to think,0.03947732
outside the box and a willingness to adjust your dream you know I still in,0.024912458
the same industry still doing what he loves and he has now had a resounding,0.029156994
success and I think that while he lets himself as a rope down as a,0.24752013
writer at the end of the movie and quite frankly if he had a better,0.05089187
producer sorry Jason Blum the producer would have you know pointed this out to him,0.037306827
and it's amazing fix the end would have been a very easy fix which makes,0.033255856
it all the more frustrating but his skills as a director are very impressive from,0.0431937
the very first scene this camerawork to his use of music to his ability to,0.032599986
make a movie that was made for under five million dollars look like it was,0.036025017
made for six time that six times that proves the appeal is a very talented,0.039809246
director he also makes some really unique creative choices throughout the film which elevate it,0.0074966196
and I would say he's the most ambitious director that Jason Blum has discovered you,0.029633932
know a new director since James Wan and Scott Derrickson and that's not bad company,0.040571544
to be it I'd be very curious to see what Pele does next when you,0.03852677
know what his next gig is if he stays in his own lane or if,0.019227799
he swallowed up by a franchise also to be fair key & peele sketches role,0.074121416
is very ambitious ly directed so even more kudos to peel for obviously paying attention,0.036429446
and learning on the job I would also say the peel is up there with,0.01914598
Kenya bears from blackish on ABC as a voice that presents black characters as fully,0.021165479
three-dimensional characters and not stereotypes caricatures or having the burden of representing their entire community,0.020726457
also credit belongs to Daniel Kuya the star of the film who gives a wonderfully,0.008701933
understated performance and you know with an American accent no less he's from the UK,0.09727978
he got his big start on Black Mirror over there that show came here to,0.02787452
Netflix but you know some of his best moments came with just a look he's,0.021369025
a really talented actor I think his body language is excellent and just even just,0.06682235
what he can say with his eyes speaking of that Pele does do some good,0.06682036
writing with the tragic backstory to begin Scalia's character and I thought that kahl√∫a did,0.015385033
a fabulous job bringing that guilt and grief to life you know like Pele set,0.058937266
him up but kouya knocked it out of the park I also want to give,0.08067081
a shout out specifically to Betty Gabriel she said she stood out to me in,0.10191545
the purge election year last year but to see her here playing such a different,0.04845264
character shows what amazing range she has and I hope she gets more work as,0.027682282
well the whole film is very well cast though and no often they say good,0.029894684
directing a lot of it is just good casting right like if you know and,0.046607424
that's you know people talk about us Tarantino right like if you can't if you,0.07610233
cast well 90% of your work is done and Pele I think this is an,0.033387564
excellent example of that for instance he did a very good job using the personas,0.03328446
that Allison Williams and Catherine Keener have already established through their other work and that,0.01322119
was that made both of them very effective here I also thought you know there,0.022714691
was some comedic relief from the best friend although here the best friend and the,0.0109608965
lead both happened to be played by black actors and that's very progressive in Hall,0.18916292
unfortunately but larell Howry was the funny best friend and he did a great job,0.056831297
I also he was huge just enough you know to lighten the mood just when,0.019382786
it was needed but not too cheap in the film and also that dog quite,0.06662945
a ball now for the ending so we're going into spoiler territory so this is,0.052596737
a warning and if you're going to bail out here if you haven't seen the,0.07229349
movie and I would like just to say that get out is worth seeing now,0.06483212
should you see it in the theater while if you're a horror fan or a,0.10822471
cinephile or you're interested in the evolution of how different ethnicities are portrayed in Hollywood,0.2127836
or you just like to be part of big events in this film has definitely,0.026450362
become like a moment in pop culture and you should totally see it in the,0.056842603
theater but if none of those things matter to you then you can wait to,0.022879656
stream it all right so last warning we're going to talk about the ending okay,0.15111975
alright so as I said the ending was weak and could have been easily fixed,0.06343723
so a good twist is one where once you know it you can look back,0.019958835
at the earlier part of the film and see the clues just ask em nice,0.008630092
Xiaolan which is you know career-defining twist the sixth sense and interestingly enough he's also,0.028949458
been working with jason blum recently but when you saw this when you'll learn the,0.025588285
twist in the sixth sense and you look back at the rest of the movie,0.02875988
suddenly saw things with new perspectives they made sense etc but here when it was,0.014228278
revealed that Walter and Georgina were actually the armitage grandparents you couldn't look back at,0.027768757
the earlier part of the movie and be like oh yeah that's who they were,0.03114789
acting like grandparents they were the servants of the house the whole time or they,0.04075048
were like not there that was awful weird like as grandpa Armitage was the leader,0.06315453
of this entire movement why would he be satisfied going from that to this chopping,0.08933217
wood and you know you know not really being a part of his family anymore,0.061788242
right they had a late night running which I guess was kind of a nod,0.056352362
to his racing past and I thought that was interesting that he was beaten out,0.03848952
by Jesse Owens to go to the Olympics and that started this whole train of,0.03956845
thought but what was he racing for to what end you know the people who,0.015097008
underwent this procedure never left the community they never did anything with their new bodies,0.063101985
so I don't understand the selling point of oh we're going to take a white,0.3974877
brain and put it in a black body and the thinking here from this evil,0.3550813
group was that both were the superior the white mine in the black body and,0.058962543
create an ultimate individual but I've never saw a shred of the original person inside,0.119996466
there like you saw the the the tragic black soul you know struggling to get,0.14814638
out but I never saw the white person that had been inserted in there I,0.43904215
never saw that person you know it was always just like some unreal zombie like,0.11913772
mode that they went into I didn't I would have been much more interesting like,0.01443249
for instance that guy was kidnapped at the beginning of the movie and when he,0.061681148
showed up at the party he I've had quirks and interests and genuinely acted like,0.032212183
the guy you know that woman's original husband but no it was just he was,0.05947274
like a zombie and so I can't look back at any mom in the movie,0.19149639
and be like I see it in a whole new light you know instead I,0.031529706
go well now it doesn't make sense now you cut them well what about Walters,0.123209305
comments about Rose when he says all she's such an attractive young woman to me,0.06707845
I felt and still feel that that was attributable to his black man's romances rose,0.19408329
but he still you know I mean obviously if you could see from in the,0.028313542
movie that was a great moment when he shot her but you know there you,0.27966157
know I think maybe he you know I thought maybe he was saying it like,0.024070336
what it was spite like she was so beautiful and she lured me to my,0.15255389
doom and I did like that twist I did like that Rose was a honey,0.14063911
trap and I thought it was very funny when she was looking up top and,0.04585377
c-double-a candidates at the end of the movie although again why bother you know if,0.04968789
they weren't going to do anything with these bodies it made no sense you know,0.0596244
the whole superior genetic argument like oh you'd be a great fighter you know if,0.06272815
the brother was saying to Daniel who use character at the dinner table but they,0.016660854
never did anything like that so you I would think they would just be getting,0.1268432
younger bodies you know who cares about the ethnicity look for people who wouldn't be,0.16575977
missed and that would make more sense to me in this in the way it,0.025771875
was set up by you know Pele and since it's his script he could set,0.034292214
it up any way he wants so if PL effects this problem and then you,0.057169873
could see that the souls of the people who've taken over the bodies as well,0.088734835
I think this would be a horror classic that would last you know stand the,0.07523227
test of time but instead it's not going to however he was so close to,0.01977857
a horror classic I'm confident that appeal will get there very soon and we'll be,0.040128533
seeing a lot more of Kuya and you know maybe it'll even give a boost,0.037719905
to some of the other people involved in the film I hope Buddy Gabriel but,0.021939753
maybe even Allison Williams might see some some reward for this as well so what,0.019372143
do you think what do you think of the whole movie what did you think,0.03783631
of a twist what do you think of the twist now that I've brought up,0.0258058
my problems with it and what do you think of Peele going forward and also,0.034073368
what he's done for the horror genre and his commentary as well I thought clearly,0.053095624
a very intelligent film it just didn't stick the landing okay write your thoughts down,0.04594889
