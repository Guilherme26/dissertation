[Music] hey guys here's my review for the shape of water a film directed by Camila del Toro a film that I was actually kind of very much looking forward to because I still have a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth after the crimson peak that was my attempt at sign language I looked it up I apologized I couldn't find the translation for the book I am and so I apologize to that but otherwise I actually really liked this movie del Toro was always known for fantastically visual films he also is always known for very intriguing characters this film is basically kind of like a quasi sequel but not really a more of an Amash prequel to the character Beit sapien in the Hellboy movies as there is a creature who is M phibian who can walk both on land and in water and just so happens to like eggs but either way this film is actually very good it does fall a little bit of stereotypes of Adele Toros previous works but the thing I will also say is this is some of the best character writing he's ever done Sally Hawkins is fantastic as a character the fact that she is a mute does not hinder her at all in character development or expressing emotion it's one of the things I've always loved about watching people who do ASL is that there's no words physically our vocally being spoken but there's so much emotion that can be conveyed just in how people move their hands and their faces how they express it Richard Linklater who I originally thought was like gonna be her father or something in this film he's not he's actually a completely very unique character the film takes place in the 50s and his character is a quite an interesting sort of situation as he is a closeted gay who wears the toupee and he's an artist and what is so interesting about this movie is that there are instances of racial profiling or just racism with Octavia Spencer's character and other people as well as there is obviously the homophobia towards Richard Linklater's character and the thing that I liked about it is it wasn't there more so as a statement but it's just how the characters are written and I like that so much it's because I understand when political statements are being said but Deltora wasn't really trying to say that he's just giving us really good characters and of course Michael Shannon wins the award for creepy [ __ ] of the year again holy [ __ ] he is so creepy in this movie but he's so intriguing his dialogue is full of such bigotry but you can't help but be someone interested in how he's going to handle things because the man just does not want to quit and as the films moving towards this conclusion you can't really help but think he's committed that's for sure really he's a fantastic antagonist in this film just his interactions with Sally Hawkins and the rest of the cast it's just so unnerving he is absolutely horrifying it's like if Buffalo Bill got to be the head of security but he wasn't a murder at least you knew about it anyways but there are certain scenes that are incredibly disturbing and very uncomfortable but some of the best ones in terms of just character development as well is just like wow I can't believe they did that speaking of which the opening of this movie I admit my eyebrows were raised because we see how Sally Hawkins go through her normal routine and then she goes into the bathtub and has a little bit of her time and they just kind of nonchalantly go over that and is their routine they repeat it again later it's like oh okay that's another thing I like about what del Toro does of this movies he doesn't care about this stuff he just like shows it like it's a regular day and I thought that was great again not forced it's just there and again that's why I like these characters so much they feel real they don't feel like stereotypes they don't feel like people who are there for us a message or a statement they are just very well-written but the creature is pretty cool too the relationship between him and Sally Hawkins is very endearing if not just a little bit weird but it's really cool to watch two people come together in a way that they can only express through themselves the music is fantastic Alexandra do pasta five saying that correctly does a fantastic job with the soundtrack there's also a lot of classic songs from the 40s and 50s that I played which is just fantastic del Toro basically makes a love letter to the 50s with this movie but he does slightly veer into kind of the stereotype of del Toro's writing mainly the last 20 minutes I was able to basically call play-by-play while his movies are dark and always kind of have a sad but slightly happy ending I still enjoyed it I think it is definitely one of his best movies that he's ever done and it's a film that should be watched it's pretty ballsy for some of the stuff that it just not gelatin ligo's over so I enjoy that I appreciate that and I'm I've been I feel a lot better now I was really kind of little about crimson peak because that movie sucked in my opinion but this was much more enjoyable this was very engaging the characters some of the best characters I've seen in film in a long time Richard Linklater kills it sally hawkins kills it Michael Shannon kills it almost literally and I just really enjoyed this movie so in the end I'm gonna give the shape of water is six out of seven it's definitely one of the best movies of the year I can't believe that both Molly's game and shape of water back-to-back maybes guys if you liked this video leave a like down below and if you want maybe subscribe anyways I'll see you guys next time
