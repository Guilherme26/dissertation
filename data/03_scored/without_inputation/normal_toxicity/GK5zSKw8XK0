hi and welcome to rouse,0.10296172
the view this video is part of my office special where i'm going to be reviewing this youth restful nominee and today i'm going to be reviewing arrival arrive of the science fiction film that's all of the story of a linguistics expert played by any Adams whose job is established communication with aliens of just landed on earth the clothes directed by denis villeneuve who also directed Sicario and prisoners i am personally a big fan of prisoners,0.09027727
i think for the most underrated movies ever so going into the summer i had high expectations because the director is so talented and does such beautiful work,0.055364933
so going into this film on has very high expectations,0.11209887
and i must say that i enjoyed arrival a lot,0.103969455
and i wanted to be very intriguing,0.05998152
so once again and start talking about the selling things that i liked about arrival,0.094116315
number three the vigil this film looks absolutely gorgeous,0.11761439
i really like the cinematography,0.0643235
i thought it was beautiful,0.10998243
and i really like the production design and the design of the aliens endless space ship,0.059457406
I was very unique and refreshing and I really enjoyed and thought it to be very creative,0.05015078
and even though you expect from something like this to be big and huge,0.081709206
it's still sold in a very confined small space,0.20402193
and I found it very interesting in claustrophobic,0.10399567
it helps increase the tension of the film,0.06310571
and it helped establish the mood of these people who are under pressure to establish communications with these creatures,0.12254428
so he's also anxiety and you from the pressure that was on the characters which was very interesting and it was established very well the number two thing,0.06419787
I liked was the sound this film is very unique sound design that,0.02978804
I don't think you're going to get appreciated much accessible people who pay attention to this kind of stuff a lot of times in science fiction the sound design becomes larger than life because it's trying to manipulate you into feeling a certain way it tries to make you feel anxious or feel the pressure or the tension of the science fiction world however the sound design here felt a lot more subtle and itself and was organic like it came from the world of the film and it really helped establish the mood,0.05293827
this is mostly evidence in the scenes where the humans and aliens are trying to communicate and the sound design in those things is pretty masterful,0.1003159
I realize this when the score came in and I also like it when the score wasn't there the big moments of silence really important to the film and really important for the mood of the song,0.09005768
so it was a very successful sense in terms of songs,0.071662895
are the number one thing I like about rival was the script this is a loaded topic,0.04944376
because I liked a lot of things about the trip to arrival I think the most powerful thing about the whole movie is the script starting from the concept itself,0.08673154
were these humans are trying to communicate with creatures that don't use language and the form of communication,0.07512044
so the film studies the art of communication itself cancer very powerful concepts talk about,0.1293887
and think about also this story is being told in sort of a non-conventional nonlinear way and its really interesting in the beginning it feels a little mysterious,0.055978246
but once the story starts to install further and you kind of figure out what is going on it catches you by surprise and I all yeah not so that means and I found that to be very interesting and unexpected,0.06705053
I didn't see and the flood twist that eventually came coming,0.026450029
and this is a really strong way of script writing and storytelling where you try to tell the story in a different way from a different angle I stayed if we would say that what i like about science fiction is one jump start asking questions about humanity itself when trying to discover things about another race,0.09047093
or another world we start discussing things about ourselves and discovering things about us as a human race,0.24118236
and it's a very powerful concept,0.057347227
it was always nice to study the film is more contained and small don't expect an Independence Day here it's more science than fiction and it's more about us as human being it's kind of like contact what's better,0.07399681
and it's also kind of like sign but better the script also has a bunch of twists and turns so there's some kind of meat processing,0.0979068
you don't really know what to make of it when it first ends however it needs a few rewatch is later for you to kind of grasp,0.24108285
what you just saw this movie wasn't a perfect film,0.16287407
so let's start talking about the top three things,0.06618533
I didn't like a motorized,0.1864832
nervously Jeremy Renner's character I like Jeremy Renner a lot and he's a great actor,0.114695065
and this character was interesting missile however from Midway onwards I thought that his character was kind of unnecessary his relationship with Amy and has been seem that interesting to me and also him as a character didn't seem to contribute much to the cause later down the line even he himself comments on a thing i'm doing here,0.092159934
and i as an audience members felt the same way,0.051126175
what are you doing here,0.094204195
you're not really contributing much,0.30193365
so i thought that he was there just so we can have someone for any atoms interact with and just to have somebody who give the some exposition,0.07033908
my texts that looks deserve as exposition on our characters that are important that I feel are necessary for the story,0.055310033
the number two thing,0.050717555
I didn't like was the pacing the tendon was very high which was really cool,0.05666731
but sometimes the sylphs no done a little bit too much and can kinda get boring there were a lot of unnecessary scenes,0.191237
and there was a lot of exposition things,0.08247769
we just can't just sit around,0.099533804
and explain stuff,0.07110318
they wouldn't have this conversation,0.14900483
if there wasn't a camera an audience watching them,0.07053611
so those things didn't really work for me,0.065897286
and also we spent a lot of time before we got into the action before we got to any cloud progression,0.027303895
the number one thing,0.064573914
I didn't like about arrival was the aliens purpose throughout,0.076301485
the marketing campaign of the film as the one the film itself the big question is why are they here,0.03400856
but like I said that some focus is a lot about the humans and towards the end until the focus becomes more about the humans and less about why the aliens are here,0.10461644
and the reasoning behind all of that didn't really make sense to me and I didn't feel like it was strong enough,0.07013786
it's possible that i need to go rewash the subsidizing kind of grasp the justification that we were given at the end but coming out of the films I didn't feel satisfied with that answer,0.071629435
and I thought it was very important to be satisfied by that answer because that was the big question that was asked in the beginning,0.031225877
and that's why its my knee straightest thing about the film I came up with some liking it a lot but still asking myself at a I don't care,0.12335331
I Daniel awesome,0.051539067
so although I thought arrival was intriguing and very unique film and definitely one of the better science fiction films to come out in the last couple of years and I really really enjoyed it even though some of it didn't work for me overall,0.04692182
I found it to be very good,0.06881649
and for that I'm going to give it an eight,0.103117205
I don't know what's up the chances are,0.06766873
but if I have to say something is a strong competitor it would definitely be the script and the sound design,0.034554742
so have you seen arrival,0.12432112
