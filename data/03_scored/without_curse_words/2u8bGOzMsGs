sick right now because when I tell you Marvel's Black Panther has broken just crazy,0.7875338
records and I'm just so proud of not only the cast the people behind the,0.12462588
scenes ryan coogler for writing and directing this I mean it's just so much to,0.36831304
talk about y'all honey let's go ahead and get started okay not only did Black,0.42374375
Panther break records they made 218 million dollars over the weekend that was just in,0.028945284
the United States they made over 300 million globally and on top of those numbers,0.07907834
this is also one of the largest openers for a black director so once again,0.26745564
kudos to Ryan Coogler he did his thing he was just a young man from,0.15510331
Oakland who had a damn dream and you know many people would have crumbled under,0.66817147
the pressure of having to direct such a major film especially being that all eyes,0.098844744
were on him the fact that he was able to write and direct this I,0.087136224
can't do nothing but just give him props all I can say that I'm really,0.10677452
really proud of Ryan Coogler like I said for not only writing and directing you,0.15056604
know watching this film not only as a Marvel fan but as somebody who's involved,0.15456012
behind the scenes in the industry who's into camera and you know who wants to,0.061227873
get into directing who wants to get into shooting more films and stuff like that,0.44766667
I'm just really really proud of him and what he brought to the forefront the,0.0703366
hashtag Black Panther is one of the most tweeted movies ever okay they broke all,0.10066859
types of records online people were hash tagging Black Panther soul it will kind of,0.15318875
forever they created so many hashtags that they have literally broken Twitter and just to,0.080069706
go through and see all the pictures of people posting at their different events and,0.0736871
the outfits I saw folks going into the movie theaters with drums down in Atlanta,0.10026603
I mean folks were showing out for this movie like you just felt like almost,0.23844236
like a global connection with so many people with people of all races ethnicities not,0.5453545
only was this movie well casted but I love the fact that it bought so,0.055265583
many different black people together globally you had people who were full African raised on,0.3344929
the continent Africa you had people who were full African but there were raised here,0.27544242
in America you also had a lot of African Americans in the cast you also,0.2234483
had some Caribbeans in the cast you also have black people who are from London,0.34198958
who are part of the cast so this was definitely a global casting everybody could,0.079412445
see themselves in each and every character and their backstories so I really love that,0.09005077
about the overall casting even now let's start with Wakanda so we were all excited,0.079409435
to go to Wakanda and to check it out and to see how it turned,0.1122371
out and I just thought that the whole futuristic feel of it was just really,0.058719963
really dope so I have to give props to the production design on Bleacher her,0.25832707
and her team they really worked hard to bring Wakanda to life it definitely gave,0.11042907
you a afro-futurist paradise you know I'm saying a lot of people are really excited,0.36904705
to just see it and this is probably one of the best Marvel Worlds I've,0.09537623
ever seen come on to screen the way that they had it mixed with some,0.091516666
of the African culture and the waterfall scene and then you had the spaceships who,0.24034232
had the technology because after all kinda is the most you know technologically advanced place,0.064477965
on the planet so they definitely woven lot of that into it I mean the,0.11523054
people who did like the animation the CG I just a lot of the stuff,0.21236354
that was just going on to make what kinda in the background what it was,0.038155835
was just crazy it was just amazing to watch it and when we watched it,0.17624463
in 3d I don't know if you guys caught it in 3d it felt like,0.12456262
you were literally in there walking around like things were just coming at you it,0.117717
was insane so I have to give them props on how they brought what kind,0.28988665
of to life I mean literally to take you know what was written by Stanley,0.16919053
in a comic book and then have it for like you know future generations to,0.10922561
see this and to like literally walk through Wakanda and be right there next to,0.07092597
Charla and everybody else it was amazing so I definitely had to give them props,0.06732079
for their hard work their team did the damn thing with bringing what kind of,0.7354604
to the screen there was a lot of black excellence in this film I mean,0.4493183
there was a lot of comedic relief as well so I thought it was gonna,0.080827884
be more serious but I love the fact that they threw in some of that,0.086942814
humor that modern-day humor when Sheree looked at childless sandals and she was like what,0.08744411
are those when I tell you the entire audience was cracking up you know I,0.056138705
love that they had some comic relief I love the handshape because that's something that,0.13581723
me and my siblings do you know I'm saying I just love the fact that,0.14995025
even though he's a prince and you know she's like you know the princes sister,0.17838453
they were just at the end of the day siblings who had love for each,0.123055145
other you know they just had a genuine connection and I just love that like,0.053084556
I said before the waterfalls seemed to me was off the chain the dancing and,0.081027396
the shaking and everything else like I felt like you know that was part of,0.09603109
my culture I felt like I was like at a Nigerian gathering so I love,0.13119741
how they makes part of African culture along with African American culture in there and,0.17531611
the references even the fact that the back story was set in Oakland to me,0.02162904
was just really really cool as well and to see like you know the african-american,0.30921313
kids out there playing basketball like it was just like everything just flowed together really,0.12391797
well it was a lot of black excellence in this film you also got a,0.3324407
feel of the pan-africanism that was running through the film which was directly from ryan,0.05248305
coogler that's why i'm so glad that they had a black african-american director who could,0.6565504
kind of insert that into the film and i don't think that that would have,0.10146488
been inserted had it been anybody else so i definitely love the fact that you,0.42495275
know that he put that in there and you felt that and then you also,0.06960918
felt like you know the pride of the african people as well in the film,0.4033028
so like I was saying before I love Sri to me she is one of,0.13179183
the breakout stars in this movie Leticia Wright did her thing you know I'm saying,0.10308037
and that's who I was so excited to see when I was talking about it,0.081136525
in my interview before you went to go see the movie because she's the smartest,0.25432983
girl in the world she's the young sister she's an IT tech so for me,0.37760803
I've always kind of felt connected her because so many times you know they tell,0.062378947
girls you know you're not supposed to be into computers and comic books and you,0.26438284
know themes that are techy and she just naturally had the gift for that and,0.06492334
it just naturally came to her I just love how she was able to basically,0.13779435
create these suits and she was like you know what the old ones are outdated,0.2773908
you know I'm updating everything and that scene when chili kicked the suit and it,0.25571322
went flying and she goes running over there like don't be kicking my inventions and,0.43948555
all that stuff like that was just so cute like I got Jubilee tees from,0.08993438
Surrey and for Yahoo Donohue Jubilee is she's like the young teenager in the x-men,0.21226528
and that's what Surrey kind of reminded me of she had like that young teenage,0.1017093
feel you know she's still trying to figure herself out but she knows what she,0.11416783
wants she knows that she's really into technology but at the end the day she's,0.1179755
just his little sister she's just a young girl so I would not be surprised,0.60461766
at all if Marvel ends up doing like the animated series around Surrey because I,0.17132126
think a lot of young people can really relate to her character so I love,0.03475691
the fact that you know there was that age division but that didn't slow her,0.12669419
down she didn't use that as an excuse you know for why she couldn't do,0.10031763
the things that she was doing so she definitely reminded me of Jubilee as far,0.085060105
as you know just trying to figure out life and you know trying to figure,0.09698782
out her powers and I was trying to put her best foot forward and then,0.18260443
even being so excited to finally go like on this whole you know fighting spree,0.20501806
with her brother and her coy yay so now let's talk about the dorm Elijah's,0.067440905
I love the women in this film and the fact that it was the women,0.26508752
who are the protectors and the warriors I thought that was dope Danny Guerrero the,0.13631772
way she bought Okoye yet to life to me was just amazing her passion her,0.31089434
fierceness and her fighting scenes was sick when she snatched off her damn wig honey,0.8243281
and through that and got the fighting I was like yeah I mean everybody went,0.10913321
crazy in the theater that was so funny and then when she was car surfing,0.33299822
on the hood of the car I thought that scene was crazy I mean the,0.31089434
graphics in that film was just insane but I definitely loved her character and I,0.21655694
also loved that she was able to bring that soft side acordes loyalty to the,0.15053093
throne of Wakanda and the people like her loyalty and her devotion was just really,0.10872793
amazing and the fact that you can see that her and Wahhabi they had like,0.10739265
this you know they kind of had like this love connection a little bit but,0.2573921
she didn't let that blind her and she was ready to take his ass out,0.93968564
if he was gonna stand in her way and I love the fact that at,0.10509052
the end you know when they did that whole little rhino scene when he was,0.24113494
charging at her and the Rhino stopped and then you know like just licked her,0.44371146
they just let you know that as hard as her exterior was and as tough,0.06508303
as she was and as tough as she's ready to give her life for the,0.15534404
king she still had that femininity about her she still had that southside that even,0.25590187
though rhino was able to pick up on that that the rhinos stopped dead in,0.24080305
his tracks and then licked her face I love that scene and then when what,0.5708966
kabhi jumped off of the Rhino and they just had like that intense moment and,0.16710751
then basically she told him you know drop down your weapons and when he looked,0.31089434
around he saw everybody fighting he saw this conflict then he decided to drop his,0.19106501
weapon I thought that was powerful you know showed that yes she was strong as,0.1637785
a woman but it was done in a way that didn't do Maskull ate him,0.28136918
you know I'm saying they still at the end stood together side by side so,0.06500674
I really love that dynamic about that I really loved how they made the dorm,0.11962426
Elisha's you know how they were these powerful women but they still had that soft,0.23999196
side they still had that caring side you know they were even scenes where she,0.080339395
kind of broke down crying so I thought that the scenes with the normalize days,0.14928183
and especially with oak oye which is really remedy and so I definitely enjoyed that,0.03605527
okay so Lupita Nyong'o played the character of Nakia and I thought that she did,0.056920927
a wonderful job she looked beautiful in that film and I think the thing I,0.122594886
love the most about Nikita's character is the fact that she was a dark-skinned African,0.42801464
woman and she was a love interest she's who captured Charlie's heart Chawla was really,0.12366613
in love with her and wanted her to settle down and be a queen but,0.17500615
she felt like you know what you know I'm bigger than this I'm bigger than,0.2248695
just sitting on the throne I want to be out here helping people and saving,0.15489848
people so I definitely loved the dynamic of her character and you know how much,0.101104505
he was like willing to fight for Charla especially after you know pill and monger,0.31134057
came to power she's like we have to overthrow him you know he killed a,0.7258586
child she realized in the end that she really had a lot of love for,0.09699781
him so I definitely loved like what her overall character brought to the screen I,0.091515295
thought she did a really awesome job as Nakia so now honey we got to,0.069919206
talk about in Baku um hey Exedy how're you doing I got a citizen tea,0.08832114
on this one okay first of all Baku aka Winston Duke that's who played in,0.1524234
Baku to me he was another breakout star in the scene this man is from,0.17550898
Tobago but he was raised in America when I tell you that he was looking,0.09054823
good as hell honey every time I heard that I was so excited to see,0.30688608
him I mean at first he was the villain he was trying to challenge chala,0.18154556
and I'm like you know what you need to go sit down but he ended,0.32557625
up being you know a vital part of the movie and the fact that instead,0.081155285
of him letting his jealousy and his angst get to him he showed that he,0.29782206
was a better man when he saved child's life and he put him in that,0.18049599
little ice box you know I'm saying so I really respected him for that because,0.095257446
he could have been like you know what oh well you know he beat me,0.19268899
in the last scene so I'm gonna go ahead and let him die but he,0.6550861
didn't he showed that at the end of it it was about a brotherhood and,0.031356204
the fact that you know there are two African people trying to leave their tribes,0.5876557
that they have to stand with each other so he was definitely a breakout starting,0.116283715
me he was also funny when he was time I eaten that white man the,0.57193017
white dude was all scared he was like now I'm a vegetarian so like this,0.403095
I'm saying there's like a lot of comic relief in this movie and I just,0.09549255
love that honey mbaku hey I'm gonna need to see him in some more roles,0.09772806
okay I'm gonna need to see him come back he needs to be a part,0.17432335
of this whole Marvel Universe I want something just dedicated to mbaku cuz his ass,0.9491533
was fine as hell he made them scenes honey every time I heard that my,0.36119422
got a little bit excited okay so anyways on to the next character another character,0.22428699
that I really loved in this movie was Ulysses Klaw I thought his character was,0.05932758
so funny he was crazy he was kind of psycho but then he also gave,0.69542736
that comedic relief when he was like baby don't hurt me don't hurt me no,0.15184453
more like I was falling out in the movie like this dude is a mess,0.5298153
and then the fact that he was like the only person the only outsider to,0.08133405
ever go see what kinda make it out alive I thought his character brought a,0.098121524
lot to the movie you know he was definitely funny he was a good fighter,0.086449526
and then the fact that you know he ended up getting played by air kill,0.44972375
monger that was insane so now let's go on to air kill monger okay when,0.64543223
I tell you Michael B Jordan he played the hell out this role uh you,0.4269885
know it's hard to even describe like night understand what black nerd meant when he,0.777337
said that there's a message in this movie like he left me just speechless at,0.13245815
the end of everything you know I'm saying you know the fact that he went,0.088115685
through our bag he got trained by the US military you know yes he was,0.080519795
a bloodthirsty villain but it's like he had a reason for his thirst and the,0.2350389
fact that he was trying to avenge his father's death and then also help not,0.24298772
only you know Africans but free african-americans and black people throughout the disparate you know,0.451244
he was that character where initially you wanted to hate him but you ended up,0.30189857
having a lot of love and respect for him in the end and Michael B,0.15996756
Jordan like I mean just the fact that he had this danghang Oakland accent and,0.14688234
he was himself he wasn't trying to be a part of the Africans per se,0.14550783
he wasn't trying to necessarily mix into their culture he wanted things his way and,0.10523677
he came to overthrow chala and he damn near almost succeeded you know I'm saying,0.6646877
so in my personal opinion I definitely feel like he'll monger is probably one of,0.12596889
the best Marvel villains I've seen to date he put so much work and so,0.14016591
into the character of kill monger that I couldn't do nothing but give him props,0.55182505
I mean not only was his body on point honey okay I mean you know,0.41360503
from a female not only was his body on point he was out buff and,0.44199154
you know the muscles was popping and everything else but besides that the way he,0.15347722
acted it out like he believed that role he was Ehrich kill monger Michael B,0.4943149
Jordan is so good and he's been in the game a long time to see,0.09887811
Michael B Jordan go from being a little kid in the wire and then he,0.30135033
was in one of my favorite movies Chronicles well he was flying and doing all,0.06375224
that stuff and then a seaman Creed and then not to see him bring this,0.18640065
role era kill monger to life I can't do nothing but give him props he,0.5593208
did the damn thing and I love the fact that he called out charla for,0.7137783
you know basically almost being selfish like you guys are in this secret world you,0.69542736
guys have all this technology you guys have things that can help free black people,0.4825763
throughout the Despero and instead of y'all doing that you guys are harvesting all of,0.08235527
this to yourself you're a selfish king like he called him out on that because,0.73039234
even Lupita's character Nakia was saying the same thing and but I understood where child,0.07976792
was coming from like he didn't want his people in slave he didn't want his,0.35065427
people you know to get hurt and killed and everything else they had been living,0.786977
in his secret land for you know for centuries so I definitely understood both parts,0.11848712
but the character of kill monger he stood by his convey shinsen he was ready,0.49136767
to die for those convictions in the final line that he set in the movie,0.26541287
I think about a lot of people to tears it moved a lot of people,0.09069646
when he said bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from the,0.279861
ships because they knew death was better than bondage when I tell you like just,0.4586281
that line that hit home with a lot of people I don't care if you're,0.2026264
African I don't care if you're african-american I don't care from the Caribbeans you know,0.71343523
we talk about this all the time on this channel you know how slavery just,0.24009353
did a number on black people globally so I definitely loved what he had to,0.34839126
say in that moment and I think those words struck a chord with a lot,0.11792691
of people I know a lot of people told me on social media they cried,0.17764914
when they heard Michael B Jordan say those words he brought a lot of excitement,0.06588326
to the film he was definitely unapologetic and I got a lot of magneto T's,0.14997719
from him okay he kind of reminded me a little bit of magneto because magneto,0.14989321
