so at Disney press screenings they take your phone they don't trust us every other,0.027521309
studio lets you keep your phone I mean they have security in the room watching,0.03251085
you you know those little devices to see if anyone's recording but Disney makes you,0.019569702
hand over every electronic device and they wand you going in to make sure you,0.123596445
hand it in and you have to put it in a little plastic baggie and,0.2553882
you get a little you know baggage claim ticket and you have to pick it,0.053438194
up after the screening and let me tell you the line is long but because,0.011411225
they do that and you have to get there early to make sure you get,0.017511625
a good seat there are no reserved seats at these press screenings so I decided,0.019982116
this time to bring some reading material and I brought the Time magazine that recently,0.016614292
came out with chadwick boseman on the front of it talking about this very movie,0.03917998
and you know what it ended up being the perfect choice because black panther plays,0.15599953
more like Time magazine than a comic book I was very surprised now it works,0.03785427
and a lot but it's different so allow me to explain first off it is,0.012756227
extremely political but I appreciated the political comments it had to make I think that,0.02187922
in the run-up to this film's release they've been made to see much more incendiary,0.030419514
than they are and they're not you know you know they've they've been made to,0.031890236
see more Malcolm X and I think they're very much Martin Luther King jr. side,0.056332406
note if you haven't seen Selma you should see it Ava Duvernay was so good,0.04696529
directing that movie she's almost got this one and she and Ryan Coogler are super,0.08509761
close he talked about editing across the hall from her a wrinkle in time you,0.023024667
know her editing as well and I hope you know we'll see if that movie,0.053780098
turns out just as political but anyway there's also a National Geographic element to this,0.046098556
film and it's exploration of Wakanda its history and its traditions and you know I,0.01985041
have to say it's it's odd to me and you know I'm not gonna go,0.046578154
into spoiler territory so don't worry about it but I have to say that it,0.03841369
was odd that a civilization was such filled ristic technology like it it almost seemed,0.052405164
made-up haha it was made up of course but you know it was amazing but,0.03163547
I don't understand how they would be so primitive in their leadership structure and board,0.10228795
that come to bite them in the butt we'll discuss in the spoiler review I,0.71793985
also have to add that for all the wonderful dynamic female characters that are featured,0.015152884
in the movie and they've made a big deal about that at the end of,0.015561972
the day they're all still support staff which also comes from tribal culture and I,0.019167932
don't think that's a great idea either so but anyway we'll discuss all that in,0.036947627
a spoiler review but well it's politics in its world-building are impressive and admirable you,0.066089325
know what I actually have to say it reminded me of a fascinating follow-up to,0.023798276
roots and that's hard for me to say because obviously as I've discussed before I'm,0.06544143
not a member of the black community I'm an outsider looking in but that's what,0.26010656
I felt when I was watching the movie as the next touchstone in the journey,0.054129984
of defining the black community its sense of self and also I think you know,0.24857931
for anyone like myself watching this material how its seen and the fact that a,0.025553696
comic book movie can achieve that is incredibly noteworthy very very impressive and again while,0.052564807
that is all impressive though the movie doesn't have nearly enough action I was surprised,0.013408107
how little action it has I can't believe that no one brought that up to,0.027295146
Ryan Coogler and said you know this is all really fascinating you're really making me,0.042342264
think and I think you're doing a lot for the world with this movie but,0.05028855
it's also comic-book movie and we promise people a lot of action in the trailers,0.050610498
so maybe you should consider delivering it it has two extended action sequences and they,0.034539662
both go by way too quickly made all the more frustrating by the fact that,0.036283772
when they click they really click there were a couple of moments in this movie,0.035357837
where my it took my breath away and most of them we're doing the action,0.081643976
sequences but some of the wort and again that's mighty impressive now as a comic,0.046308756
book movie I would put Black Panther on the same level as the first x-men,0.10311478
movie and also Batman Begins where a very talented filmmaker was still getting the hang,0.043980613
of not just VFX work but working at this level I would say to the,0.035140987
movie I would say almost never felt like a big shiny blockbuster it it often,0.031640124
felt like a small movie like the films that Ryan Coogler has been making and,0.044114314
I would say that the Russo brothers are still the best in the biz this,0.05070961
when it comes to not only doing action sequences but realizing their importance you know,0.04704312
it's like what that story that Steven Soderbergh story that they they really should teach,0.11152602
it in film school and they should may put it on every film set where,0.049483676
he said I was at an airport and I saw someone in our target demographic,0.03246096
just fast-forwarding through a big blockbuster movie just to watch the action sequences and some,0.020590095
people that's the way they consume the material I think we're all consumer the material,0.064226806
that way sometimes there's nothing wrong with that Steven Soderbergh thought there was but the,0.0871211
Russo brothers understand that's how a lot of this stuff is consumed and they build,0.07369969
their movies accordingly Ryan Coogler has yet to learn that lesson and because of the,0.06966069
lack of action I worry about this movie's repeat watch ability factor especially to those,0.029176285
it doesn't resonate with culturally another problem in terms of rewatch ability is that the,0.017427811
film exists in a bubble it has nothing to do with the MCU at large,0.017342003
that doesn't mean it's not entertaining but I just don't want you to go and,0.021008495
disappointed alright so next the music with all due respect to Kendrick Lamar's album Ludwig,0.03431882
Gordon his score does a lot to make this movie but frustratingly like the action,0.049143102
the music comes and goes too quickly I'd be like oh this is so good,0.03400419
why did you stop playing it I want more of it I'm definitely buying the,0.049072593
score as it was both tribal and modern at the same time like Wakanda itself,0.07687328
oh well Conda much like Pandora many people who see this movie say they would,0.03522347
like to go there and don't worry just like with Pandora Disney will be happy,0.02842995
to oblige very soon at one of their theme parks and they should I would,0.040511016
definitely want to go there and on that note Wakanda felt like two things and,0.023574773
the other one though was like a real place but what was a theme park,0.037715912
which again I would very much like to visit while I was watching the movie,0.0294244
it I almost was like where can I have my my brick my character breakfast,0.11574528
and where's the Black Panther ride and what time is the stage show start it,0.132015
was really cool but the other thing that it felt like and this is far,0.016992781
more important obviously is it felt like an idea now at one point in the,0.024782082
film it's referred to as a fantasy which was quite touching but even better it,0.08202845
was also established in the film as aspirational and that is Black Panthers biggest gift,0.00021839786
to the world hopefully redefining how the black community sees itself all not redefining of,0.425329
I think that's a much better word evolving how the black community sees itself because,0.2513305
it's very much has one foot in the past and also how others see the,0.023737743
black community and I think that's really noteworthy and remarkable and I'd have given Ryan,0.30706754
Coogler another hour to explore this make it a three hour movie I wonder if,0.018798755
I would gladly watch it another hour of this but he'd have to promise me,0.05299385
the 20 of those 60 minutes would be more action now that acting is top,0.04521719
notch across the board and all the characters are incredibly charismatic likeable and complex I,0.039617006
also was blown away by the strength of the relationships portrayed and a lot of,0.020916035
that is accomplished by the actors and I was particularly impressed with the brother-sister bond,0.044478834
between T'Challa and Sheree very unusual to see inmates true entertainment for any group I,0.02733173
just thought that was really nice as someone who has a very close relationship with,0.042018987
my own sister so I really like that a lot now without spoilers my favorites,0.08941066
are chadwick boseman of course it's his movie but in a very understated way with,0.04815996
tisha Wright in a very understated way I love her mind and I love her,0.0825912
fashions I would love to raid her closet she looked fantastic she I think she,0.54456806
doesn't have any thumb holes but it's in the thumb hole category we would get,0.06329821
along Danai gurira Wow totally see why she got upgraded to infinity war she was,0.06610662
one of the moments that took my breath away in the casino you know what,0.030826606
what you see it because you'll probably have your breath taken away Winston Duke what,0.17245018
a scene stealer and then Andy Serkis having so much fun it's criminal now as,0.2606447
for Martin Freeman also a warning he has a very small role it's almost non-existent,0.06285254
but I thought there was some poetic justice in it after having after having to,0.014096572
see poor Jeffrey Wright basically run through Bond movies the last couple of Bond films,0.14925125
now I would not see this movie in 3d the press screening was in 2d,0.03925781
and it looked great and if the studio doesn't show it in 3d that means,0.028493142
they know it shouldnít does not need to be seen that way for instance guardians,0.02666056
of the galaxy vol 2 was shown to the press in 3d and it was,0.024555255
remarkable this 2d all the way there are also two end credits scenes but they,0.023049278
are very low-key I mean they're nice and enjoyable but they're not like that's not,0.05881953
one of the things take your breath away Oh Inc inclusion just like everyone should,0.069421895
see roots everyone should see Black Panther I honestly feel it's that important and as,0.09013371
for its place in the MCU and as a comic book movie just from an,0.025397377
entertainment perspective the stage is now beautifully set and they should greenlight of sequel immediately,0.07717993
I mean I guess they're waiting to see how it does opening weekend on the,0.021182774
strength of this and the strength of the hype if I were Kevin Feige I,0.01440056
already would have greenlit a sequel especially seeing that the film canal with its sequel,0.31992173
hit the ground running and have more action gotta have more action you know whenever,0.15956625
I whenever I wrote a comic book called superbia and at the top of my,0.07050814
outline I'd always put sex violence in action and I'd be like does it have,0.5100429
enough of these three things and you know they should they would move them to,0.022110704
apply the same strategy to this fell to the sequel in all movies quite frankly,0.0845189
but anyway that's my review black panther I look forward to hearing your thoughts down,0.19186491
below but no spoilers save those for the spoiler review I really appreciate action you,0.03625118
know in all honesty talking about this movie with you it's a very important and,0.041125644
tricky film to discuss as we've been discussing this week and so I'm really honestly,0.03831125
you know I always look forward to discussing movies with you down below but with,0.14839116
this one I am honored to partake in the discussion of something I know is,0.013207886
so important to a group that I'm not a part of alright so anyway I,0.03382459
