is a monstrous extravagance this is Molly we are at war we won what is,0.27728802
not over you must continue so this may possibly be the oddest film I ever,0.14134227
seen the favorite struggles to fully flesh out both its comedic and robotic side and,0.073378384
leaves it as an odd last scene with several shots cross spinning into each other,0.24057503
not being aware of your girl utmost style of filmmaking I was taken by surprise,0.5154597
a minute i sat down in the cinema expecting a funny period drama with astonishing,0.18213162
Olivia Colman backed by Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz I was instead given a dark,0.052583374
and twisted dramatic comedy and the struggle and fight between stone and Weiss's characters as,0.17310162
they aim to please Queen Anne played by Olivia Colman and becoming her favorite you,0.110482745
have become close to Abigail she is a Viper you're jealous well I felt that,0.17188674
the story didn't wasn't really fleshed out in any way I didn't really understand maybe,0.048295673
it was just above my level of understanding it just left me wondering what the,0.06250169
heck I just spent two like hours of watching I did read a review on,0.3255843
Rotten Tomatoes and someone said it was like smoking a Jurgis lung tumors joint and,0.25065106
you're just like hi for about two hours not really sure what's going on and,0.18538302
that's pretty much what I felt the minute like the credits started rolling same time,0.099178046
even though I was completely confused and actually just like what did I just watch,0.06287147
I was also very astonished by the non-commercial take on period dramas the way that,0.08366103
this film just come plays out it's very different to any other pure drama which,0.16934182
kind of interested me and made me more interested in looking into more of yoga,0.16364515
slant sinners films and now that I'm more aware of his style of filmmaking I'm,0.31089434
gonna be less surprised and less weirded out about what the hell is happening and,0.50916666
watching that film The Last of Us uses extreme humor which a liver Coleman is,0.08078387
amazing actually is just fantastic there is that one scene that has been doing its,0.059962787
rounds on Twitter where Queen Anne just goes up to this little servant boy it,0.3801466
was like did you look at me and he's like shakes his head she's like,0.26735297
did you look at me look at me have you looked at her since I've,0.191999
talked you down I'll get me and it's like she just plays it so freakin,0.66521204
well laughter Moses we really really odd fish I shot and hiring a loud sound,0.25292048
track to create one of the oddest but most fascinating films I've ever seen the,0.09286344
acting is probably the best thing and the what stood out the most to me,0.07895052
throughout this film and Coleman and amis own are comedic geniuses I just loved Emma,0.09952134
Stone in general like I'm a big fan of her I've been a big fan,0.1096602
of her since like easy a Crazy Stupid Love so like a good couple of,0.8165125
five six seven years yeah she's just incredible and Olivia Colman is someone who's like,0.22771968
come into my life recently and I'm quite excited to see what she can do,0.28173578
with the cream in the crown because that it's got a completely different role to,0.06800817
you like what I've seen her doing before because it's a very serious the queen,0.24905789
is very very different to what she is usually like Olivia Colman and of course,0.17719819
Rachel Weisz is probably one of the most amazing and underrated actresses that we have,0.05471107
and I'm very excited to see more of her because once I watch the film,0.08009121
I can get a little bit obsessed with people and I start watching like all,0.27661768
over their films and I think a Rachel Weisz is the one I'm gonna go,0.116138674
into next and just watch pretty much all of our films because some of them,0.11671825
are pretty freakin amazing I just feel that together these three my like million actresses,0.37225908
they kind of like tie it together because even though I don't feel that the,0.08378029
film is completely fleshed out either through it's like comedic side or it's dramatic side,0.11185792
I just feel that the actors kind of just like take it and run with,0.08499362
it and manage to like create something really really good especially Emma Stone a little,0.09581269
bit comb and I'm just a genius is that the comedic side and then Rachel,0.15147035
Weisz just comes in with a dramatic and the really really intense and really really,0.072328255
sassy and she's just like together and they're just like really really good but in,0.4650157
general like the film in general to me just felt - I was too aware,0.038088813
that I was watching the fit when I was too aware that was science and,0.055777118
watching the screen with this drama played out and it didn't really feel real I,0.066706836
like when you get like completely engrossed in the film and you can't forget that,0.06318443
you're watching something and you just like imagine yourself but this is actually playing out,0.31089434
in front of you and it's not just a film I just feel that with,0.1341361
the really loud those really really loud music like really really hard by beating or,0.24201718
like slamming of string instruments of piano and it's very Howlin very very loud and,0.24724136
that along law the fisheye lenses and the fisheye shots it just kind of takes,0.09839251
away from the experience of being engrossed in a film and you're just very very,0.1637521
aware that you are in the cinema watching you film and there's people around you,0.09762078
and I didn't really get that I didn't really get sucked into the film which,0.4785
is something I love about go to the cinemas and just like sit there two,0.07869035
hours and yet completely sucked in to film but with the favorite I just never,0.4418778
really felt that it was I was just constantly thinking what the heck is going,0.4146445
on I do not really understand this and I was just constantly confused to be,0.07876422
honest I just think that to enjoy the favor like I watched the trailer and,0.07836809
it looked hilarious but once I was in the cinema and watched like the films,0.13005026
playing out there were any real light laugh-out-loud moments because the funny moments had already,0.07275701
been in the trailer and I hate when they do that I hate when like,0.18448767
all the fun bits or all the like iconic bits are in the trailer doesn't,0.09577394
really lead you into like getting anything else when you actually watch the film and,0.099451035
I think to be able to enjoy it you cannot go in there expecting a,0.15921243
funny period drama it's a completely different stories it's a completely different genre and lanten,0.11583868
was just like takes period drama and just like deconstruct it and just makes it,0.099809445
a new thing so it's literally just it looks like a period drama but it's,0.11302872
got none of the same tones and it's just a very odd piece of cinema,0.10052026
isn't it in general I was just left with utter confusion battle by the odd,0.048735626
film that I had just witnessed and I also I was like sat there as,0.05081634
the credits started rolling as like these file shots for just like merging into each,0.15760812
other and I was just thinking what did I what what happened how did it,0.05392846
end I didn't really like it took me a while I had to like really,0.0672714
think about it to realize to understand how it ended but it was oops my,0.102923274
hair is all crazy it was an odd experience I just like me my friend,0.37661764
just kind of just looked at each other just laughing like what the hell does,0.53272974
not I feel but I put on my would watch journalist I probably never would,0.15608422
watch that but I am and she to watch lobster and also killing your secret,0.794439
dear the lobster looks incredible it looks really really good but yeah with us being,0.079094775
in award season the Golden Globes just passed and I didn't actually watch the Globes,0.044325117
I was too I hadn't even watched any of the films or the TV shows,0.10604108
so I just didn't feel it was worth staying up until 5:00 a.m. to watch,0.0559406
the globe's but being in the word season this film was nominated five Golden Globes,0.07429688
and I do believe it's gonna pick up a couple of nominations both in the,0.051323935
sags and at the Oscars I don't think it's worth winning maybe like the performances,0.12791514
both Olivia Colman and Emma Stone are incredible in it I think Olivia Colman will,0.15281512
be picking up a couple of nomination don't really feel like it's the strongest for,0.07517209
performances of the ones I've seen so far and the film in general isn't not,0.045410246
strong and if you compare it to all the other films so definitely better films,0.100353755
that came out last year that deserve to win and deserve the nomination and that's,0.14498933
just my take on it I know a lot of like proper like film geeks,0.1513891
and film cinema files and all of those people probably enjoyed it but this was,0.058449045
just a little bit too far above my level of interest I'm usually not a,0.11544263
big fan of period dramas but this look we need to be funny and it,0.11114791
looked interesting but once I was in that cinema it didn't live up to my,0.10165909
expectations and it was on the best a film I've ever seen but yeah that,0.06358413
is my little review that's my take on a favorite this is the first video,0.07925854
of roll the credits I hope you enjoyed it and hopefully the background will change,0.18914367

little savings box and assigned to take that album cover as well as building I'm,0.07372528
