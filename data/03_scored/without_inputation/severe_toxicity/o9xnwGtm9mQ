what's up guys it's well back again and today's review is the latest installment in,0.03605761
the Marvel Cinematic Universe Thor Ragnarok Dora bagging rock the third installment in the Thor,0.051859047
franchise directed by Taika Waititi kicks off when the evil hella invades Asgard hella the,0.19397819
goddess of death seeks to rule Asgard and many other lands in an attempt to,0.18549643
establish her dominance over the nine realms and bring death to those that defy her,0.526683
Thor after his failed attempt to protect Asgard gets stranded on a strange planet where,0.03720771
he's captured by Valkyrie and forced to become a gladiatorial fighter against his friend and,0.0659177
fellow Avenger The Incredible Hulk before long though Thor assembles a team and the rest,0.0357177
of the film has spent watching the team or crew attempt to escape this strange,0.013675511
planet and take back Asgard from the Ebola alrightso thor ragnarok had a pretty interesting,0.13880587
marketing strategy in contrast to the previous two Thor films that were decently serious overall,0.021002509
the third installment was marketed as a more lighthearted silly and fun popcorn flick and,0.2360315
honestly that's exactly what this movie is Marvel's marketing efforts we're not misleading in the,0.02437632
slightest and overall I enjoyed thor ragnarok but I think the more the time passes,0.025362788
the more hollow I find the entire experience to be a lot of people are,0.07718259
claiming to this film sets a new standard for the MCU I really could not,0.03134545
disagree with that more this isn't one of Marvel's worse films but I wouldn't say,0.057149254
it's one of their best either I think it's somewhere in the middle of the,0.044779498
pack this is not a film that's ever going to bore you it moves at,0.07386132
a very quick pace and I found myself pretty entertained for the vast majority of,0.016442675
it there's some exceptional visuals some really nice comedy very solid performances across the board,0.056291167
but I gotta be honest I'm not overly fond of the goofy at all cost,0.15489534
approach that Marvel is currently taking with their films this is two films in a,0.0304847
row now and spider-man homecoming and Thor Ragnarok that I felt missed great opportunities to,0.037674673
be something much more than just a silly albeit entertaining superhero film the problem here,0.19585401
lies in the fact that Marvel seems fairly intent on making every film with the,0.040598817
same tone as guardians of the galaxy and there's not a tone that aligns naturally,0.06515806
with some other heroes in their stories Marvel was always injected bits of humor into,0.024622438
their films to add varying elements of lightheartedness to make the experience more family-friendly that's,0.027853236
totally fine I think the vast majority of people have always been fine with that,0.040322766
now it seems that Marvel is intent on taking the comedic route above all else,0.03574697
and I think that's gonna be something that's not gonna resonate with a large segment,0.0469154
of their fanbase Thor Ragnarok is a very entertaining movie that I very much enjoyed,0.037003502
watching but I feel like it's the kind of experience that won't resonate with viewers,0.04014317
in the way that Marvel films of the past have I think the primary reason,0.029019302
for that is that the film oftentimes refuses to take anything seriously most people probably,0.02258232
won't even realize this when they're watching it but I think when you leave the,0.038643844
theater and start thinking back on your experience you realize that it could have been,0.021099625
so much more if not for the tone that just seems off there's several very,0.03495274
funny moments but there's this inescapable feeling of emptiness I felt when reflecting back on,0.032376483
how little character development takes place over the course of this two-hour film I consider,0.06263635
that a huge missed opportunity because these characters have sort of become parodies of themselves,0.013706774
and that's kind of sad to me because I've become very attached and very invested,0.01878412
in these heroes and their stories that it kind of made me feel like I've,0.017558187
been betrayed a little bit by Marvel with how little they're progressing those characters Marvel,0.114113584
has always had a formula to their films but now the formula seems to have,0.019495202
shifted heavily in favor of comedy Thor Ragnarok a lot of times feels like a,0.041816104
comedy film with superheroes in it more than does a superhero film with some comedy,0.06910992
in it and that's probably something that's gonna resonate strongly with the family-friendly crowd but,0.02077435
I think will disappoint a lot of the more hardcore Marvel fans that are heavily,0.07957658
invested in these characters and their growth because there isn't much growth here for any,0.013123408
of the characters really like I said it's not like the movie isn't funny it,0.02053954
certainly is but there has to be a certain point where the filmmakers sort of,0.03000843
rein things in and refocus the audience with the serious issues at hand Ragnarok does,0.04300213
really well with its comedy but it doesn't do so hot with its drama and,0.07561941
it occasionally doesn't know when enough is enough and to put it serious face on,0.062301766
hell even guardians does that guardians struggles tones pretty effectively Thor Ragnarok doesn't really this,0.06878465
is starting to become like a vent session but I just feel like this direction,0.027076965
that Marvel was going feels like an over commercialization of their product and attempt to,0.017003424
be overly family-friendly above all else even telling a compelling and well-thought-out story some people,0.07124715
will love that for me I don't I miss the attempts at serious character development,0.06388623
but like I said there are definitely some things Thor Ragnarok does really really well,0.030174727
the visuals are outstanding and this is right up there with guardians from Marvel's most,0.020175684
vibrant movie yet the costumes the planets and the battle sequences they all look really,0.026537502
colorful and really great visually marvel hit another home run here it's a beautiful film,0.039131425
to look at performance wise I think everyone's really good Chris Hemsworth is good and,0.015291907
the row is always albeit a little more comedic this time around Tom Hiddleston returns,0.039330315
as a new more family-friendly albeit still mischievious low-key Mark Ruffalo is good as Bruce,0.061603323
Banner aka the hog but don't get your hopes up for development there's basically none,0.071643606
to be found for him Cate Blanchet is solid as hell if she's not a,0.1873064
great villain but she's certainly serviceable and Tessa Thompson is a nice addition to the,0.09010312
team as the strong-willed Bao Cree their performances are all pretty good I also really,0.050385002
enjoy the action there's a lot of style to be found in the battle scenes,0.042987492
that lends itself to the strong visual offerings Marvel has always been good with action,0.042652905
and they continue that trend here by delivering some really cool fight scenes they don't,0.031746555
quite rank near the top of the list but are still fun lively colorful and,0.014532267
exciting nonetheless but overall Thor Ragnarok is a fun experience but I really do believe,0.04282452
it's important that you go in expecting comedy and light-hearted superhero fun above all else,0.065841205
because that's what this movie is I thought it had solid performances across the board,0.045060206
some nice comedy vibrant and lively visual offerings and some strong action sadly also felt,0.020298744
the film didn't Joe tones well and felt overly silly and the character development was,0.09254966
lacking pretty heavily regardless i'm gonna give thor ragnarok an 8 out of 10 and,0.24583444
generally recommend you check this one out in theaters if you enjoy Marvel movies or,0.05223288
you're just looking for some fun in general make sure fun is your highest priority,0.034043435
though because that's what this movie offers first and foremost so did you guys see,0.019011613
Thor Ragnarok yet what did you think of it and if not let me know,0.056649033
why not and also let me know your favorite Thor film honestly I'm taking Thor,0.04859965
1 I think it has the best story and characters that's all for now though,0.012355786
