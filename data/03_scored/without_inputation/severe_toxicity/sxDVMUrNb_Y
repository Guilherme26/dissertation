arrival is directed by denis villeneuve the director of prisoners Sicario and enemy his films,0.07679013
over the past few years have all been on my top 10 lists so I,0.026861446
was obviously very excited for arrival and this film stars Amy Adams Jeremy Renner and,0.033206634
Forest Whitaker and is the story of aliens that have come down to earth they've,0.12147983
landed in ships no one knows what they want so they send Amy Adams a,0.029916635
renowned linguist to try to communicate with these aliens are they hostile are they peaceful,0.21137008
what did they want why are they here and this movie was getting an absurd,0.06787534
amount of buzz all positive it had like a 100% for a really long time,0.028506445
I actually saw this movie on Monday at a screening and I waited this long,0.035454288
to review it because I really needed to process it more I felt it was,0.022211812
going to be a mistake if I just jumped in front of the camera and,0.14120984
gave you my immediate thoughts because the film really messes with your mind a lot,0.070874654
and when you get to the third act it makes you rethink the rest of,0.01662427
the movie and I really needed to process this film think about it before I,0.04554579
jumped in front of the camera so that's why I waited this long to review,0.13027422
it first off this is a gorgeously directed movie if you've seen any of Danny's,0.040882852
films you expected that the cinematography here is some of the best of the year,0.0167307
particularly the shot in which we first truly see the alien aircraft it's this incredible,0.079341106
long take encompassing the entire area this thing has landed in there's fog surrounding it,0.039583083
it's jaw-dropping and he does such a good job of setting up tension in the,0.06935936
first act with this character you learn of her very tortured past and as these,0.23449361
things start to land around the world you see news reports and it's very reminiscent,0.024261909
of signs another very good alien invasion film that you guys probably know I really,0.09572192
like there's that sense of panic and paranoia you're wondering exactly what's happening here are,0.019005626
they hostile are they peaceful is this gonna be War of the Worlds or Close,0.25154665
Encounters of the Third Kind and that first act does set up a lot of,0.022497842
tension it also sets up a great character and Amy Adams because this is one,0.01803845
of the best performances I've seen from her the entire film really rests on her,0.05900312
shoulders and her bizarre unconventional character progression it's a very different way of telling a,0.026747035
story once you understand the way certain things are going in the background and if,0.011686612
you're paying attention from seeing one it's gonna make sense to you no I don't,0.02756388
want to get into spoilers in this review I think that people should go into,0.09285831
this movie as blind as possible the reason I wanted to think about it more,0.08550271
though is because I wanted to tell if certain things really added up in my,0.024350377
mind and if things made as much sense as I thought they did while I,0.04161123
was watching the movie because at first when I left this movie there was part,0.04090414
of me that felt a little disappointed when a movie is still at 100 percent,0.020401182
on Rotten Tomatoes when it has like 70 something reviews you go in with mammoth,0.08676722
expectations if I were you I would temper those expectations just ever so slightly because,0.09030932
you don't want to go into a film thinking you're going to get the experience,0.06500973
of some heavenly or of amazement when it might just be really good when it,0.021752836
comes to this movie what I like the most about it are the visuals the,0.066459164
direction the cinematography Amy Adams performance and her interaction with these beings because the film's,0.022627553
story in regards to communicating with aliens and using a language to solve problems and,0.049861502
not cause problems is a really good message and it's also a story of International,0.015916515
Cooperation and how for once everyone just has to kind of settle their differences and,0.047497436
work towards one goal and I'm sure you knew this and I'm sure a lot,0.029892689
of other critics have said this but this is no Independence Day this is not,0.024243949
a big action film this is more of a suspense drama centered around characterization using,0.03218757
a more otherworldly circumstance to build that characterization kind of like signs did you're not,0.04583714
gonna see laser guns and big explosions in this movie this is more centered on,0.14096439
character is this movie the best alien invasion movie ever made I would say it's,0.056709565
definitely up there it's one of the best top five for sure is it the,0.014951998
best movie of Danny's career I would disagree with that I would say that prisoners,0.037377335
and Sicario are both better than this film I think those films are more well,0.033877138
paced this film is very slow paced deliberately it moves along at a snail's pace,0.07447529
and for some viewers that's gonna be a humongous turn-off for me personally every frame,0.11425726
in this movie is dripping with visual beauty so if you appreciate things like that,0.05670092
it's gonna move faster for you and for me it did because it's just a,0.03697889
gorgeous looking movie one of my biggest gripes with arrival is the character by jeremy,0.044145577
renner I find him rather useless there's even a scene where he says he has,0.20863485
no idea where they'd be without Amy Adams character he has one scene where he,0.0479185
figures something out on his own without her help but for the most part he's,0.06789663
kind of in the background like hey yeah I'm here I'm in the Avengers I'm,0.08988094
Hawkeye I'm I'm here I'm relevant to this movie he just doesn't really add much,0.055922654
to the film as a character he's fine with his performance but his character is,0.010741386
rather bland and doesn't really have much to do in the film also the entire,0.02819381
marketing push of this movie is why are they here it's on almost every poster,0.021267917
once you learn why they are here it's sort of glossed over very quickly it's,0.07078951
just kind of thrown at you and you're meant to process it very fast and,0.07026601
then suddenly ignore it so that aspect of the movie disappointed me it was more,0.042503238
about Amy Adams character and less about why these things are here and I appreciate,0.025882961
the overarching symbolism of what's going on trust me I've thought about this movie a,0.058415096
lot and I don't want to spoil it for anyone that's why I'm not getting,0.027972303
too into it but in the end aspects of the third act and the way,0.018782126
things came to a story conclusion did feel a little rushed also there are some,0.031378042
characters in the movie who watched too much TV and make a poor decision I,0.03960304
don't want to spoil anything for you but that felt so out of left field,0.03922854
and the overall impact of what they did didn't last more than a few minutes,0.050674357
and really didn't change anything in the movie it just felt like a device to,0.021327782
hopefully gain a little more suspense out of a few scenes and it didn't really,0.023777654
build to anything so I wonder if it was even really necessary all in all,0.07724112
arrival is a beautifully shot movie with great performances Forest Whitaker also really good in,0.07226755
the film is accents a little iffy amazing visuals intriguing aliens a third act that,0.024450155
has a very very cool revelation that really made me think differently about the entire,0.01763402
film I love that about this film but the aspect of why the aliens are,0.03895914
actually here on earth wasn't really explored as well as I would have liked it,0.058872078
to be in the end I would highly recommend seeing arrival it's sort of a,0.023099167
mash-up of contact signs and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and I like all,0.058662545
three of those movies seeing them all smashed into one was definitely a fun time,0.33917665
for me I'm gonna give arrival and a - guys thank you so much as,0.09255232

Fest in Los Angeles I'm gonna try to see Moana la-la-land and split I really,0.028284274
