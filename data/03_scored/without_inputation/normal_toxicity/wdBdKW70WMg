hey y'all welcome back this is my review of Jun ho bongs 2019 film parasite,0.4939452
Joon ho bong is a South Korean director so this is definitely a foreign film,0.15676852
subtitles everywhere and which I don't mind I love foreign films and he is the,0.12854324
director of okhta from 2017 magnificent animated movie there and he also did snowpiercer with,0.08357503
Chris Evans back in 2014 I think or 2013 that also is a great movie,0.034322146
and parasite is more along the lines of snowpiercer and that it examines the disparity,0.4031616
between rich people and poor people and what the poor people will do in order,0.40337503
to get rich and what the rich people will do in order to stay rich,0.17887403
but it doesn't go so far as to show that the levels in snowpiercer it,0.07453463
mostly focuses on this poor family in South Korea and what they do in order,0.15372662
to sort of get a leg up in society they're poor in the way that,0.4355745
it's kind of comical but kind of terrible at the same time because they live,0.17295969
in a sort of like a basement of an apartment building their windows face the,0.15055116
street so we got them there they're you know living quarters and then the street,0.17580384
levels right here so they can see people walking around and they can see all,0.08522435
the activity outside and so when their windows are open all they get is noise,0.07416718
from the street and everything so there's not going on and I say they were,0.092638664
so poor that their dad he advises them to keep the windows open so that,0.22554494
when exterminators come around with you know their gas and they're shooting everything everywhere that,0.53716356
some of that fumigation can go into their little apartment and then kill their bugs,0.69886655
and that way they don't have to pay for the fumigation at all so kind,0.5154597
of funny but still kind of terrible that you got to be in that situation,0.35810736
and it's that the movie was on that kind of a road for a good,0.07605474
a good 50% of the movie was like that was really kind of funny watching,0.079172686
them con this wealthier family and it was very good satire as to how a,0.084977195
lot of poor people have to be like super-smart in order to survive basically so,0.40433455
while it shows that a lot of poor people have to work extra hard at,0.19178389
getting smart or or or becoming athletic or anything like that in order to get,0.11758628
out of poverty it also shows that once people get rich they kind of stop,0.15235786
learning things they're a bit more soft as far as as far as dealing with,0.19615872
the world is concerned because they're more insulated along or along their own rich communities,0.110218704
you know they're not exposed to everything out there in the world so it the,0.15019272
movie does a really good job of showing those two those two different worlds really,0.057765838
and how this family integrates itself into working for this rich family basically taken advantage,0.24613222
of then they're conning them and I loved how the the rich people aren't made,0.45162457
to be the villains or the victims and neither are the poor folks you know,0.28118208
the poor folks that in this movie do what they got to do it's fraud,0.24094902
it's wrong but they do it right and the rich folks are completely unaware so,0.12842792
what's going on with them they're just kind of like falling for everything but you're,0.16283244
like well are you stupid or you're just naive or or what is it you,0.8885242
know and so when the movie took that left turn and went from a satirical,0.17500564
dark comedy to basically a horror movie with very little gore but still is very,0.24181008
tension kind of shocking as to what happened I stopped rooting for the funny conman,0.47331542
family you know and stopped feeling bad and then stopped feeling bad for the rich,0.0966572
folks we're getting taken advantage of and I liked how the movie didn't let me,0.078410536
say okay these people are bad these people are good that's all there is to,0.40323418
it I like how it didn't do that everything was great funny at first and,0.08752599
then kind of terrifying at the end and then kind of shocking at the near,0.1509941
near the end credits but it's a it's a very well-done movie I can't say,0.0484527
that I wasn't I was looking forward to it and I I wasn't in any,0.08186445
way anticipating what was happening in the movie I couldn't call out anything I wasn't,0.056887615
alike okay well this is happening so that that's gonna happen later I got everything,0.13060755
wrong I got everything wrong in this movie and I loved it I loved that,0.15128227
I got everything wrong about it and it's two families the rich family and poor,0.2420265
family both mother-daughter father-son so it's four people to each family right and so the,0.24015868
rich family obviously they live in this huge house you know gated security all kinds,0.29507393
of crap and I would explain the poor family's living situation but I liked how,0.76945394
both of their the character flaws are highlighted in this movie to show their downfall,0.15000397
right because the the pork family their character flaws they wind up really screwing them,0.5433493
over later on at the end of the movie which was I thought was brilliant,0.10983715
because it wasn't something that I paid attention to and I would never have guessed,0.07741095
it but the character flaw just came back in a huge way at the end,0.09533631
of the movie and completely ruined them and then same thing with the rich family,0.21593751
their character flaws screwed them over kind of in a worse way you know towards,0.42656147
the end of the movie and I really I really loved that like I said,0.08225819
before when I reviewed Joker I hadn't seen this movie at the time but this,0.07959491
has to be also one of the best movies I've seen all year long really,0.03637452
is it really is I couldn't find it in the theater anywhere near me so,0.07936699
I did find the UH the illegal means online so if it comes out on,0.06363274

highly recommend you check it out you watch it in the sense that it makes,0.0835228
you think about the state of society nowadays and between the rich and the poor,0.31089434
it's very much like Joker except that it focuses more on the wealth inequality gap,0.08382657
whereas Joker was mainly about mental illness but towards the end of the movie I,0.23880522
was like wow this is practically like Joker in so many ways now that I,0.13683031
see this ending I was like okay that's that's kind of disturbing but it was,0.14135328
good very good movie I'd give it an 8 plus so that's it I don't,0.09322171
want to give away anymore spoilers I don't think I gave it away any spoilers,0.1039338
but I don't want to give away too much about the movie it is funny,0.100399695
it's darkly funny it's very good dark humor in here it does become quite tense,0.05910667
when that movie makes that left turn turns it to like a horror suspense thriller,0.15609616
thing the move the ending is fantastic the cast all do great work it shot,0.4903501
very very very nicely and man oh man that ending is twisted so yeah if,0.29110625
