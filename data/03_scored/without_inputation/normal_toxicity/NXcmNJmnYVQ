update of the spider-man franchise and who can blame them anyway that's not what I'm,0.089999765
here to talk about one of you to talk about is the favorite now what,0.07436072
is the favorite we may have heard something about it because Olivia Colman won the,0.08266035
Best Actress Award at the Golden Globes couple of nights ago for her performance as,0.062077187
Queen and Queen Anne you say who is Queen Anne well Queen Anne was a,0.110641405
queen of England yes funny enough in the early 1700s now I don't know very,0.18180265
much about Queen n when I was all about 16 or something I learnt a,0.11643019
mnemonic which is blong 4 6 8 9 which stands for the battles of Blenheim,0.09876614
families Luton odd and mal placa in 1704 1706 1708 and 1709 and that was,0.06288515
doing a war against the French during the reign of Queen Anne but I don't,0.1497951
know much about her apart from that now what happens in this film well this,0.10511545
film is about Queen Anne a not a mad monarch but certainly a monarch with,0.23657252
her issues I suppose is what we could so we'd say to it in this,0.07758766
in this modern day and she has a lesbian relationship with a couple of people,0.51982087
one of whom is lady MOBA who is the wife of John Churchill ancestor of,0.051935647
Winston Churchill the first Duke of Alba who was gifted Blenheim by a grateful nation,0.056643363
after his victories against the French now in this film lady Marber is portrayed as,0.14212364
not just the power behind the throne but in almost you could say the power,0.0391907
inside the throne as she spends a certain amount of time nuzzling nuzzling is that,0.1187618
a good word nuzzling up to Queen Anne until she is supplanted in Anne's affections,0.15098348
by Emma Stone who plays a lady who has fallen from grace to become a,0.122898236
servant girl for some other complicated reason and then as a consequence of her becoming,0.17787963
the favorite of the Queen Queen Anne and develops a bigger place at court and,0.110010296
in an intense rivalry with Lady mor burr who is played by Rachel Weisz and,0.043973688
must-own plays Abigail that's the name of the other lady now couple of things about,0.07921281
this film that are wonderful the first thing is it's a film about women and,0.16995165
the three lead characters are women there are men characters who sort of dance around,0.27074957
them but they're not lead characters these are three strong interesting powerful women and if,0.2882573
that isn't a statement about Hollywood in these modern days I don't know what is,0.059015617
and let's have more of it guys the other thing is it's very funny it's,0.07859861
very rude the certificate is a 15 and when you see the certificate and at,0.20085067
the front of the film it's there's strong sex scenes so oh dear but there,0.50050384
weren't any strong sex scenes there's a little strong sexual language and there is a,0.44678918
lot of sexual innuendo and it is very well handled but there isn't a lot,0.4468961
of sex scene so you can take your 15 year old I think it's 15,0.7686918
you can tell your children this certain amount of what's the word lack of fear,0.18374074
they'd probably rather go and see spider-man in the spider verse but this is a,0.096597984
fabulous film now it reminded me very strongly of three other films the first and,0.08455134
perhaps most obviously is the madness of King George where Nigel Havers played George the,0.31546894
third in his descent into madness and it's film it's it's set in a similar,0.3155203
period not quite the same period but very similar period the second film it reminded,0.053292092
me of is Barry Lyndon Stanley Kubrick's film starring Ryan O'Neal of all people and,0.12002946
the reason for that is that Kubrick's film was shot entirely with natural light lots,0.15411374
of scenes lit purely by candles and large parts of this film are lit either,0.08198706
by candles or just by fly alight and it is beautifully lit beautifully filmed the,0.06846027
interiors are sumptuous the costumes are fabulous it is an absolutely wonderful piece of filmmaking,0.17205642
in that sense the third film it reminded me of is Peter Greenaway the draftsmen,0.07728272
contract which is about probably 30 35 years old now and and it reminded me,0.046960093
of that because of its episodic nature now though it's divided up into a series,0.09466118
of chapters eight chapters I think in each chapter has a little title and then,0.07216648
the scene follows on from that the music is also very similar to the music,0.040570017
that Philip Glass that was it Philip Glass that Peter Greenaway was it Phillippe loss,0.13142814
I think so I thought Peter Greenaway used or was it Michael Nyman actually I,0.053326953
think it was not from Michael Nyman sorry I'm getting a bit confused here anyway,0.1212476
the music is very similar to the music in the draftsmen contract I did find,0.06576739
at certain places in this film that the music was rather intrusive a bit too,0.10147371
loud and a little bit annoying so just a minor criticism there the other minor,0.34758466
criticism I would have is that one point one of the characters says from now,0.027074557
on it's okay now I not sufficient of a student of the English language to,0.15077183
know for certain whether the word okay was in common parlance in 1708 at the,0.07241367
court of Queen Anne but somehow I doubt I doubt it anyway back to the,0.07017049
film it is a wonderful film it is beautifully acted Olivia Colman is brilliant Emma,0.15071458
Stone is excellent Rachel Weisz is excellent the minor characters are all excellent it is,0.051286213
superb super hard to think of enough good things to say about this film one,0.1861083
does kind of wonder not well not wonder when kind of longs for a time,0.11961261
when our monarchs were mad can't really say mad can you but you want a,0.22453718
monarch that is absolutely and utterly corrupted and destroyed by power and our monarchs are,0.41719508
kind of you know they're becoming close to normal people I don't think we want,0.31818613
that and I don't think I want Prince Harry as a normal person I want,0.26759508
him as a mad crazed pal obsessed lunatic monarch I if I'm gonna be ruled,0.77415216
by a royal family and I did test the idea of being ruled by law,0.086257346
finally but if I'm going to be ruled by the wall family and it looks,0.06220828
like I am until death us do part I want it to be moved I,0.5154597
want I want my royalty to be off the wall that's Queen Anne I mean,0.21732828
she's not mad can't say mad but she is she has issues she has issues,0.33876583
and the issues are not really resolved so the film is funny it is sad,0.050814793
it is tragic it is enlightening I have no idea how close to the truth,0.076745614
it is and I don't really care it is an master class in filmmaking and,0.089540504
filmmaking for adults it's not a children's film it's not a film for young people,0.122164115
it's a film for thinking that sounds a bit snobbish it's a film for thinking,0.3207655
adults I saw it as I always do at the dunnage picture house with my,0.15391465
darling wife Jane and we loved it we saw it on Monday Monday's cheap seats,0.1457077
day which means the cinema is full of people who have plenty of money but,0.12743595
like a bargain and there are a few things that annoy me more than somebody,0.24252658
who has money and likes a bargain and we were there on a Monday because,0.08818524
we like a bargain but if you want to see a great film and possibly,0.0895175
the best film of 2019 already close second spider-man in the spider-verse that only being,0.09199462
the two films that I've seen so fine 2019 go and see it see you,0.14014825
