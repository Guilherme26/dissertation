the Oscar wins a parasite,0.47630543
it won Best Original Screenplay bong joon-ho,0.15761128
the director won Best Director won Best Foreign Language Film and Best Picture at this point I assume if you watch my channel you're a movie person you've probably heard of parasite you're not a movie person and you watch my channel Thanks in a world where I have nothing to offer for this review,0.37513995
I have nothing new to offer for this review,0.09403577
there are YouTube videos breaking down parasites at nauseam doing the deep dive,0.556903
so really I can't offer you anything here that you haven't already heard except for my personal opinion,0.14774987
I guess you haven't heard that yet that that's the thing in this video,0.11293271
you can't find anywhere else,0.10667569
you can find my face this face,0.2351292
hey you clicked on it,0.25684905
parasite is a South Korean film,0.47108066
but what it's about okay,0.074967496
it's like this like,0.08617693
I know the director bong joon-ho I saw him say the best way to go into this movie is cold,0.11595702
so I'm gonna give you a non spoiler warning basically I'm gonna do that first act setup that I do in any review where it's kind of like oh here's kind of what the movies about all right cut off before we start getting into spoilers and here's what I think about the movie so out of respect for him and his work,0.13669023
and the fact that he would want you to go into the movie cold not knowing anything,0.099390976
I'm gonna let you know alright I'm gonna kind of let you know where the movie heads if you don't want to even know that long story short you should see parasites great but the movies about this family living in poverty and the son gets the opportunity to be an English tutor,0.45085365
for this rich family's daughter,0.25925303
and then he's like hey I know someone who could be an art instructor for your son,0.07993945
and then he kind of weasels his sister into it the whole family just kind of weasels their way into this rich family's house,0.54956114
and of course the rich family doesn't know they're all related,0.114938915
so it's this whole,0.075886875
they're hustlers,0.5128512
it's a scheme,0.13234907
going on and that kept the movie really engaging even intense,0.070487924
when there wasn't necessarily an intense moment but it's always on your mind like are you guys,0.11553848
but the movie is definitely about classism and the rich versus the poor and the way this movie breaks it down and portrays,0.11551054
it's pretty genius,0.13531728
I mean that's not even all there is in the movie I mean it's about social class social status this side versus that side yes but it's not even limited to just that to the point not to sound redundant but it's a movie about human beings,0.10357475
how we treat each other versus how we view each other how we don't even think it's well here,0.15754631
but it does it in a way that's fun,0.052367855
so it's weirdness out loud,0.1092822
but the movie is actually quite fun,0.05933799
in its execution,0.31911558
it's funny it's whimsical it's fun,0.08691436
but also turns up the drama it's relevant it's actually dark thought-provoking,0.085434586
this movie has a scene that goes from fun to very intense to pretty dark and tragic not every filmmaker can pull that off,0.10651967
without having conflicting tone,0.10996422
there's a scene with a storm that wonderfully,0.10050454
illustrates like how the two families deal with it,0.112785235
and what it means to them,0.06784745
and it just it puts it all into perspective for it's a kid,0.09606238
this is actually a true story,0.037173595
I was young I was no older than 11 or 12,0.18808106
and remember this girl she was younger,0.14420469
she was in the single digits probably eight or nine,0.07779376
so she's younger than me this is in church and we were all all these kids were pumps cuz,0.19150855
we were like,0.03806382
yeah there might not be any school tomorrow,0.20012887
there's gonna be snow,0.07549931
yeah no school and snow we're gonna play in the snow is gonna be fun,0.057974357
but I remember her saying it's easy to say that but what about all the poor and homeless people and they're gonna freeze,0.14908145
and that's it's easy to see it your way but what about how they experience,0.0683458
it true story,0.043966457
and this is the 90s you know what's in social media around it,0.056251757
it was like this kid just goes to church anyhow there's a part in this movie that kind of illustrates the same thing with weather and it just took me right back to that that time when I was a kid that a younger kid taught me that lesson that parasite sillas wild world and it's one of the impressive things about this movie more than a few times,0.34735918
I've seen a movie have a message,0.05116711
but it's like the movie relies on its message to carry the entire thing,0.101406775
so it's like off,0.112358
the message doesn't hit you it's what do you have,0.13028507
now,0.031218953
what do you have for a movie,0.10287478
what do you have for a film,0.124802224
what do you have for entertainment,0.15252112
but this movie if you want to see the message and you definitely it's there,0.06671738
I mean at a point you you can't not see it anymore,0.105092816
but the movie itself message,0.07659549
aside is remarkably entertaining,0.07265987
it's like a dark drama comedy,0.3004249
it's a dark dramedy more movies fail at that then succeed at that and parasites,0.75392795
one of the ones that does succeed in that and astronomy we call that the Goldilocks zone God give props to Kang ho song I believe that's how you pronounce his name might be a couple of mispronunciations in here,0.12674063
but that dude everyone in the movie does a great job,0.081609115
I thought they were all fantastic,0.06957348
but when I think of the cast like he's the one who stands out he was amazing,0.07919285
I'm actually really shocked he wasn't nominated for an Oscar,0.08820208
but dude just crushes it I thought it was great,0.091399476
it's definitely one of those movies you need to do a second pass like after you watch it you should probably watch it again,0.06874454
because when you start realizing how the movies addressing what it's addressing and how it's breaking it down cool to go back and watch the movie again,0.1025056
and see how it does it from the beginning up until the point you actually kind of it gripped you with an implication does that mean I watch this movie twice,0.15068984
but yep there's no real rush to get my review out,0.08790968
so yeah I watched it twice,0.07838188
I was glad I watched it twice,0.08838923
I appreciated it more the second time cuz in the end,0.090714574
I thought parasite was great,0.48174384
I'm not one of those people's like Oscars are the end-all be-all but if you're working in that industry they kind of are for you and your career,0.15480421
so I know everybody's touched on it,0.18099003
but seeing the look on bong Joon Ho's face when he won the Oscar for I believe it was Best Screenplay there's smile on his face puts a smile on my face the spectrum of people after they watched parasite,0.55378586
it's like it's the movie of the decade or it was great whether or not,0.07876597
it's the film of the decade film of the year or just a great movie that's a different conversation most agree,0.037471913
it's a solid move,0.06711015
it's great,0.06999714
it's well-made it's engaging,0.06953628
it's well acted,0.10752216
there's definitely worth watching definitely worth buying on blu-ray right so parasite have you seen it,0.5616253
