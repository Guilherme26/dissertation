classic movie review today we're going to be reviewing it happened one night from 1934,0.10021645
one of the great romantic comedies of all time well that's what a lot of,0.08182823
people say anyway and it is directed by Frank Capra it stars a Clark Gable,0.071698844
and Claudette Colbert I believe that's how you pronounce her name and it's about a,0.10359467
spoilt highness who runs away from her father after what she feels his mistreatment and,0.2401525
on her bus journey to New York she meets clock gabled character who is a,0.094908684
newspaper man who his job is a you know it's on the line at the,0.12660071
moment he looks like he's going to lose his job and he really needs a,0.1561039
story that's worthy of him keeping his job and and this woman is incredibly famous,0.31089434
and if he can get her story to his newspaper he might be able to,0.058716718
get to keep his job and during this period their romance and saw characters sort,0.06746997
of develop along the way and several situations and shenanigans in the shoe so what,0.1287371
did I think of it happened one night well that's what I'm here to talk,0.06736794
to you about today the main things that I really enjoyed in the film the,0.05896012
first thing has to be Clark Gable because I believe that this is I haven't,0.05743749
really seen Kyle gurgling much I haven't even seen gone with the wind not because,0.059745975
I don't want to see gone with the wind is because I literally don't have,0.070873566
time in my life to sit down watch a movie for four hours um it's,0.15369947
it's too long but it literally is too long though I don't have time but,0.08333459
wait if I ever get the time I might might watch gone with the wind,0.06593651
but that might not ever happen and this is the first one were ever seen,0.093246706
Clark they blew so and I think he was fantastic in this movie I think,0.15414783
he was really charming what are you entertaining very funny quick he had quite ego,0.3281115
in this film and he was just really sharp and I really enjoyed him in,0.15207456
this film there's a lot of great scenes with him and called at Cole but,0.08255258
that just they bounce off each other really well and she's very good in the,0.2570977
film as well but I think cloud gave already steals the show here I think,0.18389153
he's very very good very very charming very very entertaining but one of the main,0.16555205
reasons that these two actors work so well together is because of the script I,0.15343656
think this is a very very sharp script for the time is very very fresh,0.08323038
and it's very very funny it's not you know it's not an out and out,0.10471566
comedy this isn't a laugh riot or anything this isn't like a Marx Brothers movie,0.106960304
this is this is a more of a light comedy but it's still very entertaining,0.08535416
and you definitely get a few chuckles out of the script and I think it's,0.1419214
maximized by the performances by Goldberg and gable I think that they really bring this,0.058713008
script up on upper level but I think it's a very good script my things,0.094301194
very well written Capra does a great job directing this movie it's got his sort,0.1426072
of nice sort of sweet sentimentality to it you can definitely see Kat Pratt in,0.057227943
Spielberg if use the way they direct their kind of have every man film sort,0.12042874
of sweet sentimental messages and overall I really enjoy his direction in this film is,0.07058696
still not my favorite Capra film that would be it's wonderful life which I should,0.15518858
maybe be reviewing this Christmas as a special video so look out for that but,0.07758341
yeah I think capper is a very good director I want to watch more of,0.084706895
his films and this was I think one you know I've watched two of his,0.23426196
films now on both of them in a very good yeah I thought there was,0.09545195
specific scenes especially that I really liked in this film that was a scene where,0.052048728
Clark Gable talks to Cole boots character about how he undresses which is a very,0.24013749
funny scene there's a very famous scene about hitchhiking how to hitchcock hitchhike which is,0.18614317
very very entertaining and there are many other scenes that are very good like comedy,0.09093965
very entertaining very sweet and innocent and this film is very innocent I mean anyone,0.15224688
could watch this this it's not going to offend anyone this is a really nice,0.16152078
film anyone have any age young and old could watch this film they enjoy it,0.15024383
and I think that comes sort of onto my negatives with the film it isn't,0.054144498
really specifically a negative is that it's a little dated this film and you'd expect,0.1687234
a film from 1934 to be a little bit dated that's not really my main,0.124304235
negative it really is is that it's very predictable I mean you can I'm just,0.11976351
going to say it they are they end up getting married at the end Clark,0.077853784
Gable and Cole but they were lost you fall in love and they get married,0.22820732
and you know that's you know standard its standard what happens in romance films they,0.058080427
you know we will get a happy ending and it's fine but I'm one of,0.31089434
these cynical people but kind of likes that sort of thing to be turned on,0.48147246
its head every soft and I feel like the best romantic films do that the,0.1334575
Casablanca cause of this world the Vertigo's even though the vertigo isn't straight up a,0.11362272
romance it's as much your psychological thriller as it is a romance but I feel,0.24214518
like the best romantic films try to do something different with the ending because it's,0.09873214
so easy to just do a happily ever after and that's pretty much what this,0.07552555
film does but you know it is it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the,0.054363474
rest of the film it would have just been nice to see something different so,0.075189866
overall I really enjoyed it happened one might thought it was really sweet and funny,0.10398494
I thought the script was fantastic and I thought the performances by product cobalt and,0.053402856
especially Clark Gable in this film we're very very good there's only a few negatives,0.062663466
being that it's quite predictable ending and there is a little bit dated but that's,0.102255225
what you would expect from a form of this age when overall I really enjoyed,0.14877906
it's wonderful it's a wonderful life no it happened one night I really enjoyed it,0.15223059
and I'm going to give it 8 point 5 out of 10 and yeah it,0.15102579
would have been a bit higher if maybe the ending had been slightly less conventional,0.24479839
but I still really enjoyed it and I definitely you know tell you guys if,0.05717337
you haven't seen it to check it out it probably won't be a blu-ray purchase,0.12665269
or anything I'm probably not going to go run back to see it anytime soon,0.087700926
