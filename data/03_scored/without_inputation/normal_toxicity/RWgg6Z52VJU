lady bird is written and directed by Greta Gerwig and stars Saoirse Ronan as a young girl named Christine who would prefer everyone in her life to call her Lady Bird she's trying to navigate the remaining years of her high school life while also searching for a college she'd like to go to she'd love to get out of Sacramento,0.1999921
if she was given the opportunity and this is a coming-of-age story that's different than most usually ones that focus on a girl or about a romance of some kind like she meets a boy and it changes her life and then she's able to go out on her journey and experience great things Lady Bird does meet boys along the way here one of them played by Lucas hedges but this movie is not a romantic love story about Lady Bird,0.08600048
and some boy,0.060644988
this is a love story about mother and daughter and how the two of them are so drastically different and how they both make each other's lives really hard,0.14883028
and in just that one way this movie is so fresh and so unique and extremely pleasurable to watch this is one of my favorite movies of the year it's extremely well acted,0.0683906
Saoirse,
Ronan gives probably the best performance I've seen from her she is so so drastically real in this movie and one of the best parts of what Greta Gerwig has done with her script is that scenes kind of begin they don't feel like they have a natural beginning like most movie scenes do when you sit down to write a script sometimes you think about how am I gonna start,0.19975618
my scene well we'll have this logical progression that builds into the moment,0.07679905
oftentimes scenes begin in Lady Bird with characters mid-conversation and you're like what were they just talking about,0.15473463
well it doesn't matter because we're now observing this moment and the moments are so well realized because the scenes just come about that technique keeps this film feeling so raw the film also has a really great balance of portraying our lead character at this religious school that she's going to and it's making it hard on her,0.062486406
she wants to blossom,0.12374243
she wants to do a lot with her life,0.19040799
but there's a lot of restrictions there normally when films have a character at a Catholic school or something very strict like that they portray it as this big negative like a really horrible time in their life where they weren't able to follow their dreams this movie sidesteps that and presents it as simply not necessarily a roadblock,0.13525723
but just something that Lady Bird has to deal with it doesn't say you shouldn't go to Catholic school,0.23010607
it doesn't say like don't believe in these things because it's hard on you it just shows moments,0.10072044
it feels like you're watching contained moments throughout this character's life which the best coming-of-age stories do that all the performers across the board are terrific Laurie,0.05712945
Metcalf Lucas hedges all of them really strong work,0.11758636
there is not a weak link in regards to the actors here the film also balances the right amount of embarrassment with realism,0.19446743
there's so many scenes here where you just cringe for the lead character but it's not awkward in the way that some films do when it comes off kind of pretentious like hey look at this really awkward character,0.24048026
we wrote aren't they so unique and different and weird,0.09914392
aren't I a great writer,0.07776635
Greta Gerwig really does a great job to avoid all of those cliches I'd be curious to know how much of the film is improvised because the dialogue flows so naturally between actors I found myself really caring about these characters,0.08868974
I was wrapped up in their lives,0.18342195
and I was honestly concerned about them,0.062907174
I felt like I wanted to befriend them and be like it's okay,0.16791812
you know there's gonna be a next day,0.078508526
you can get through this,0.091455765
and that's the sign of a great movie when you forget that you're watching one,0.08891273
and you just feel so invested in the characters Greta Gerwig has done a great job with her solo directing debut she had co-directed another film once before but this is all her and she shines,0.06846439
this is an amazing debut and I can't wait to see what else,0.09346888
she does a few times a year a movie like Lady Bird comes along the kind of film where it feels like hey this could go on a lot longer like I would like to see what else these characters do I want to know what else,0.101583146
these people are going to do,0.08203581
what are they gonna do tomorrow,0.09296948
I want to know what's happening in their lives and it's almost sad when it ends because you're thinking man I was really wrapped into that it's short,0.13772482
it's like 93 minutes but it's quite an enjoyable watch,0.10153755
and in retrospect I have not one single flaw or anything about this film that I felt out of place,0.18947434
it's a mesmerizing debut Greta Gerwig should be really pleased I'm gonna give ladybird and a plus it's starting to expand to more theater,0.1912748
so that's why I got to see it today,0.053100295
