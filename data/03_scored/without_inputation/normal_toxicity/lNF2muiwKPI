the black clansmen,0.124589756
hi my name is Kyle Suggs and welcome to my channel and I'm going to give you my conservative take and we're going to start right,0.07405617
now,0.031218953
so the way this works is I'm gonna give you my movie review based on five categories and of those five categories and we're gonna score it,0.07252972
and I'm giving you a four star rating after that I'm gonna give you a conservative take on whether or not you should go not go or to go with caution,0.17907147
now mind you this section will include spoilers,0.13833357
but I will indicate that above and you can skip over that if you like to do that go into the description and look for the index and you can skip forward to anywhere in the video okay,0.091600575
so now with that let's get started,0.058734145
so the black clansmen is Spike Lee his latest movie it came out in 2018 it stars,0.15292354
John David Washington as Ron star worth as well as Adam driver and it's a based on a true story about an infiltration of the police into the Ku Klux Klan and it's interesting because Ron star Werth happens to be black and so this story is pretty interesting,0.34212115
because obviously it's very difficult for a black person to join the Klan and so Adam driver is a person who actually helps with this sting operation and so as far as the story is concerned,0.53490317
it's a pretty decent story,0.0514869
it goes forward with Ron stallworth goes to college campus,0.09626498
he meets a woman that he falls in love with,0.31089434
and ends up finding out that there is a gentleman,0.07430613
there who's the political person and they're worried about potential Black Panther uprisings,0.24077708
and so he's supposed to be spying on that but to find out he actually decides to let's do this and infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan so he gains permission to do that,0.1538453
and then escapades ensue so as far as the story is concerned it's pretty cut and dry,0.21261117
but since it's a true story,0.04894167
I'll give this rating a 7 as far as the emotional impact in this movie,0.06105493
I don't feel much,0.15211235
I mean I'm a black man and I still didn't really get any movement in my emotions one way or the other out of sort of what blase I was expecting something a little bit more powerful,0.48938718
but it was trying to be a comedy and then trying to get serious,0.12165073
so it really didn't have any impact because I didn't really know what it wanted to do in terms of its tone,0.05590542
and so yeah I give it a 5 as far as the intangibles for this movie again this movie doesn't have much,0.098673075
it doesn't jump out at you the direction is anything spectacular,0.15477368
it's it's okay,0.081963934
there's the acting is,0.049342096
okay,0.050967902
I guess the screenplay is so so again the mood of the film is all over the place,0.05332628
you don't know this wants to be a comedy if it wants to be serious,0.25128084
what is it,0.05756553
I think Spike Lee just kind of phoned this one in and he expected this to actually be you know an oscar-worthy movie so for the intangibles I'm getting a 5 as far as watch ability,0.10255881
I give it a 4 because I don't really want to see it again,0.094935484
and I don't want to recommend it,0.1013791
the last few minutes just destroys the movie it's too much on the nose and that's nothing about this film,0.2620801
he does stuff,0.12791358
that's way over the top,0.051148023
and it's like the messaging is just in your face punch you with no subtlety whatsoever,0.8333481
it's a clear propaganda piece and I don't want to see it again,0.14195389
and I don't want to recommend it my overall rating for this film it's going to be a 6,0.12870188
and that's highly generous because I mean I guess there is some decent acting in here and it is fairly well put together,0.04640204
but the story isn't really good the soundtrack or the score really isn't that memorable the climax in it into the film is a misnomer,0.069102176
it's poorly directed,0.14275393
by the way this is a spoiler section not that you they care anyway but just so you know so Spike Lee at the end of the movie does a three or four minute montage,0.068038784
on the Charlottesville incident where he takes the president out of contact saying that there are good people on on all sides the actual quote,0.058098074
I'll put up on the screen is not what he said in the context and if you look at the actual situation there Charles Vil it's a lot differently,0.05559475
what the media was portraying it,0.07820399
and if that's all he has to lay on the president's feet in terms of being racist,0.4565896
well I mean that's pretty that's pretty weak and he tries to draw loose comparisons to America first about the plan using that slogan,0.24103226
and he's obviously taking a dig at Americans,0.4376721
and that's also very weak considering,0.11931011
the fact that Spike Lee wants to essentially say that he's for illegal aliens over Americans that's that's the messaging,0.42281765
the America first,0.072821476
it's put legal Americans first over illegal aliens and here you have a guy who talks about the bondage of the African people of African despo yet he wants to put the people that struggled hard for over,0.51571196
a hundred years where they actually were whipped beaten,0.21355544
lynched he's gonna put these people in the descendants of these people in the back of the bus for illegal aliens which is essentially what you're saying I think now is a good time to mention to spike that every person,0.76815724
every races that was depicted in this movie by an actor was a Democrat that includes George Wallace that includes President Woodrow Wilson and yes even includes your main antagonist David Duke at a time of this occurrence in history,0.18561673
David Duke was a Democrat and though some of you may be saying hey but the party switched and so forth,0.1141086
well that's not true,0.053827778
it's very easily debunked,0.1013919
I will leave a link below of a video that I did that's very well documented called the three ways to prove that the parties never switched so check that out and also his messaging,0.10487401
he comes out and says you know what he says well once you go out and get a gun,0.35229945
he has Stokely Carmichael who was presented in the movie who basically whisper in the lead actresses ear saying go get a gun and arm yourself delete a character stallworth and the female lead here knock on the door they go grab their guns and go out Blake blazing but they go out of the sea what's outside and of course it's a cross burning in the backyard,0.36117184
and it goes into this montage,0.08345247
it makes no sense whatsoever,0.23699631
but at the same time he wants to have the socialist liberal mentality in terms of an victimization of Africans,0.46749127
but he wasn't turn around and say go and get a gun,0.26528218
so that's totally hypocritical,0.66984594
in terms of the messaging front coming from the left,0.06594971
so I don't know what Specter he's trying to do,0.14859037
and then he wants at the full on the Oscars and put down the green book as if his movie is so much better well spike your movie was not that much better,0.15674305
in fact it was horrible,0.25833905
in comparison no one's claiming that spike always want to have an Oscar to his name for Best Picture,0.05890443
he got Best Screenplay he shared it with three others,0.081889056
and by the way he was only person to actually speak during that ceremony so spike in there what man you really dropped the ball on this one and you really showed yourself on this and no no one needs to go see this film the little bit that it was good you've ruined,0.32892212
it towards the end with that out of context montage racist crap that she put out there trying to portray people in a light that they weren't supposed to be,0.794439
so that's my rant and I'm done with that,0.11121523
so my final take on this movie is basically it's a rating of 11 out of score of 20,0.14421405
it's a two and a half star movie,0.057291683
there's some few things in there that keep it from being a total piece of crap,0.89319855
but two and a half stars definitely dunkels see this,0.083585694
and so with that I'm done and if you like with this content on this channel,0.14141946
