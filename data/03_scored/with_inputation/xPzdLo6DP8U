buzz from other critics The Farewell Billy's family returns to China under the guise of,0.14317468
a fake wedding to stealthily say goodbye to their beloved matriarch the only person that,0.40309876
doesn't know she only has a few weeks to live so is this smaller flick,0.23990558
one of 2019 must-see let's find out but before I get into my thoughts let,0.15259252
me know what you guys thought of the farewell and if you thought this was,0.076533094
as delightful as I did now let's get into some of the good so the,0.13755661
farewell I had been hearing a lot of buzz from other critics obviously one of,0.061334692
my good buddy said that this was a great movie to go check out and,0.088784106
I gotta say I could not be happier to have went out of my way,0.15398638
to the local art house theater across town and check this one out this movie,0.06546873
if I had to give one word to the farewell it would be delightful director,0.058820833
Lulu Wang and the cast and everyone involved took this based on a true life,0.11153096
story and framed it in such a positive manner because looking from the outside in,0.048328146
this is a heartbreaking story you know the through line it's gonna be grief and,0.062420223
sadness and I'm not gonna deny those aspects are here in the farewell but the,0.064912826
way that they frame everything and the way that it's structured it's more of kind,0.07603276
of joy and happiness and celebrating someone's life then focusing on the bad and that's,0.24140228
what I think I just loved about the farewell was that they kind of put,0.07203678
this positive spin on everything rather than you know dark dreary the end of days,0.13584818
type thing and I think that that's why I thoroughly enjoyed the farewell because it,0.075170614
exposed us to traditions and cultures that personally I'm not too familiar with we don't,0.061050247
see them on the big screen that much and it felt like a refreshing watch,0.10760763
from the family dinners and discussions to the wedding ceremony and then obviously at the,0.034405928
core of this movie the the way that the Chinese people handle cancer you know,0.56069833
instead of letting the person know they kind of let the whole family know don't,0.07633359
tell that person so then they can continue living essentially a normal life like nothing,0.34017175
is dragging them down because they think that the idea of cancer is what actually,0.19529717
kills you rather than the cancer maybe I'm paraphrasing but that's essentially the lesson or,0.6639048
the theme in this farewell movie and I'm sure you're probably thinking I mean personally,0.13887714
I even thought it's a little bit dumb but you know it works and the,0.70674616
way that I mentioned that it's kind of this light-hearted fun manner is because you,0.10464548
can only imagine the shenanigans the lies what they have to do to keep the,0.24172036
charade going so this gram of theirs they're their agent grandma does not understand or,0.31895107
figure out what's going on and it is like I said a lot of the,0.07867077
humor is derived from this stuff along with the performances and the family aspect at,0.0354614
the middle of it again I didn't think I was gonna be laughing out loud,0.07478383
I got more joy than sadness from this movie because the way everything again the,0.06356225
way everything was structured you know the performances all the way from Aquafina to Han,0.10663837
Xin I think it is each of them turns in a solid performance and I,0.26593548
entirely buy into this family dynamic because you know they're sitting there having dinner you,0.08885442
know each of them are kind of laughing bickering know maybe mean a little sarcastic,0.38164195
here or there and there are also the two dads who are brothers who hadn't,0.08762951
seen each other in years they get back together it doesn't seem like a day,0.107328005
has passed and that's why the farewell worked so well for me because it's not,0.039597288
just this one aspect you know this aging person that's dying from cancer it's sort,0.31825817
of this family drama also making myself think about my family like I don't know,0.1393415
how long some people in my family have I haven't seen an extended family for,0.075706385
years I need to get together sit down just have a big dinner and start,0.079237655
to I guess enjoy or cherish or celebrate someone's life again I thought the farewell,0.2422446
was absolutely delightful I found a very few negatives about this movie I thoroughly enjoyed,0.10648791
it would recommend it to anyone there's maybe one or two three to five second,0.05383756
shots that didn't entirely line up maybe I was missing something but that was the,0.09404096
only negative I found here overall I was completely blown away by the joy that,0.10675807
The Farewell brought to the table from the beautiful story to the performances to the,0.06137558
humor and light-hearted tone and again this family dynamic and also making really think about,0.08222806
things I cannot recommend the farewell hire like you need to go see this movie,0.16171865
