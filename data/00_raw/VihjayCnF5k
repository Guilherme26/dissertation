deep cut knockout of a debut film by Ludwick we're talking about the farewell starring the very talented aquafina B probably known as a bit of a hip hop artist or the token person of color and movies like oceans a bad neighbors there she is getting just flexsim us in a very deep very moving emotional role which wow man this movie does such a good job it's very economical in terms of how much story it packs into a short time great editing great lighting great shooting in terms of cinematography just really beautiful and you just you go away to a place and you're part of this family for the time that you're with them as very very moving stuff as I've already said and great juxtaposition of a societal commentary on east and west and the yawning gap between there and dying traditions and the sacred nature of family
