I you all right guys Mad Max fury road um a lot of people's most anticipated film of kind of the summer 2015 area was avengers age of ultron came out last weekend did a lot of money did a lot of money did fairly well with critics you know wasn't as good as the first one um yeah I I like it I'll enough it's not amazing but mine and I I know like a select handful of people that that their most anticipated film was mad max fury road and I've been wanting to talk about this for a while and here it is so mad max fury road is kind of a it's not a sequel it's not a reboot it just kind of is a world in George Miller's world a movie inside George Miller's world it doesn't really have a time in a place um it could be considered a sequel to the originals but it's really just kind of its own thing using that mythos um Mad Max was created by George Miller who made classics like babe in the pit babe pig in the city and happy feet you made Mad Max road warrior and Beyond Thunderdome brilliant brilliant visionary director and he's back with what is I think will be the absolute [ __ ] best movie of the summer Mad Max fury road is on balls to the wall all out [ __ ] adrenaline-fueled mayhem fest for two hours it is it is incredible this meant this movie is just as good as all of the trailers are it is absolutely fantastic um the plot is simple this this movie is essentially quickly I i I'm not gonna spoil anything but if you really don't want to know anything about this movie like I don't know maybe skip to the end um mad max fury road is it's essentially about in period or furiosa and more more so than max furiosa is is played like Charlize Theron who is this the kind of right-hand man woman two immortan joe kind of the king of this wasteland and immortan joe has every once while has his kind of disciples go out on oil run say they drive however many miles to a city to get oil and furiosa is is tasked with heading over there to get the oil after kind of a weird run-in we are the the tankers and the cars are sent out on this mission and we learned that furiosa is a traitor she is a traitor again this really isn't a spoiler this is kind of what the movie is she's a traitor and she has stolen immortan joe's five wives and is taking them to freedom what ensues is a two-hour long chase scene it is incredible it just just on it on and on and on in action in mayhem and where max kind of falls in line is we find Maxie's taken prisoner by the disciples of immortan joe and one way or another is kind of brought onto the tank or the furiosa is driving and they have to work together to save these women um yeah this movie is pretty something special this is this is not a movie that gets made right now it is weird it is action II and let me let me like specify this movie is very very very [ __ ] weird um like when I saw this I I I honestly don't know how mainstream audiences are going to react to this because like in the trailer trailers there's a lot of action but like they have touched on none of the weirdness like this movie has some weird disturbing kind of gross [ __ ] in it and it's awesome I love it it's fantastic if you love mad max you're gonna love it but like I don't know mainstream audiences can get on board for like the amount of like weird crazy [ __ ] um you got Nicholas Hoult who plays knucks who's kind of one of them Morton Joe's disciples and he is just crazy he's just a crazy character he somehow kind of gets brought in with Max and furiosa on this um this just crazy ride and you know it just takes you through canyons and deserts and sandstorms and just action set piece have her action set piece after action set piece it is just one long action scene the cinematography and this is beautiful beautifully beautifully shot and what like compliments like the just beautifully shot film is the fact that almost I'm gonna say like ninety percent of this movie is practical effects a lot of the color yes color has been corrected so when you look at that you like yes that's not natural but like that's pretty much it all the exploding cars the flipping cards the crashing cars the stunts it's all real um it is and it is just wild it is absolutely wild the stuff that they do in this movie it is unlike anything I hope this movie makes a shitload of money so they can make a sequel because George Miller said he already has a sequel written and it's ready to go if this is profitable which oh it is great it is so fantastic what's weird about this movie though is how furiosa is pretty much the main character um max is in it but Tom Hardy as Mad Max he's great he maybe has 20 lines of dialogue the entire movie he does not say anything at all he's just kind of there and he's good and he's grunting and you get a good performance but this movie belongs to Charlize Theron as furiosa this is badass she is badass she is God she would make such an amazing action star and in this movie is fantastic for just like it's just great and it gives this this woman just a really really strong she is the strongest character in the entire film and it's it's something different it's a breath of fresh air I think all of you guys who especially just film lovers are gonna love this film um yeah I can't praise this enough this is the summer movie that you all want and it's a summer movie that everyone's been asking for it has thrills I have one tiny complaint and that's about midway through the movie it stops for just a little bit um the movie does kind of just come to a halt it them in the story it's nighttime and things are happening and it's like stationary for like ten eleven minutes and it just needed to be quicker that is my only thing I was kind of just like all right come on let's get back to what this movie is good at and this movie is good at actions spectacle it you don't get tired of it there's no numbness where an Avenger I got kind of numb with the action mad max that is not there at all it's just exciting and just it's fantastic and junkie XL score is really really fantastic as well it's a perfect complement to the film um mad max fury road comes out on May fifteenth I'm gonna give this movie a 9.5 out of 10 I loved mad max I am so ready for more movies like this give George Miller all the money that he wants to make these weird r-rated action yeah also this movies rated R how cool is Warner Brothers they're like the one one of the only studios that's still taking chances on films you know you got Jupiter ascending which was kind of a Miss but it was super original and it was something and they that that movie costs a ton of money and they dumped into it same with Mad Max a huge budget all rated action movie no other studios are doing that but Warner Brothers so you got to give those guys props they're listening they want to do this I hope we bring back r-rated movies Mad Max fury road is fantastic I hope all of you guys see it thanks as
