thanks to curiosity stream for supporting crash course hello as you might have noticed I'm,0.12486216
not Craig or Lilly my name is Michael Aranda and I'll be your host for,0.106999956
the last third of crash course film now since we're getting to know each other,0.08638291
let me ask you a question what's your favourite film maybe there's a movie that,0.079215
makes you want to get fit or become a spy or save the world or,0.13849124
maybe you love anything that zoe saldana is in because she's just the coolest films,0.1833447
can have an awesome story or sloppy lighting dazzling special effects or characters who are,0.056269333
just straight-up stereotypes all these things can affect how you feel about a movie or,0.11224709
whether you'd give it a thumbs up on Netflix because that's a thing now but,0.075741164
they can also affect how it fits into cinema history and impacts the world around,0.07136864
us well think critically about a lot of different movies starting with an American classic,0.10820152
that many people call the greatest film ever made it came from ambition and some,0.097930856
unusual circumstances with Orson Welles at the helm and even though it's been a long,0.055772714
time since its release in 1941 the film's technical cleverness and stories still resonate with,0.07789623
audiences today I am talking of course about Citizen Kane calling Citizen Kane one of,0.0783507
the best films of all time is a complicated claim to make to be honest,0.0663989
the idea of ranking movies and making a top 10 list may be fun but,0.04380865
it's not what film criticism is really about it's about thinking deeply about how the,0.09674689
movie works both to us as an audience member and within history in society it's,0.10614837
about understanding deconstructing feeling and learning so is Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made,0.07632298
well we can't answer that because that's not the question we should be asking but,0.047385663
there's clearly something about it that sticks with us and maybe that something is its,0.073640026
origin story Orson Welles was hoisted into the spotlight at the right young age of,0.058684874
23 when he was performing with the Mercury Theatre Company a troupe that he helped,0.06250741
create in 1938 Welles directed and narrated the radio drama the War of the Worlds,0.12115749
and supposedly struck fear into some listeners who thought that an actual alien invasion was,0.15828098
happening we know now that in the early years of the 20th century this world,0.044141248
with being what closely by intelligences greater than man but he also caught the attention,0.35672173
of studio execs at RKO one of the five film studios that reigned during the,0.01429411
Golden Age of Hollywood not only that but they gave him complete creative control which,0.073715694
was like really unusual at the time so he did what any plucky artist in,0.08791919
his mid-20s would do he packed up his stuff and invited his buddies from the,0.10170469
Mercury Theatre Company to come with him to Hollywood now I don't want to sell,0.0896866
them short this was a group of very good actors and despite his lack of,0.25954926
experience with the movie industry Welles lept into this project with a lot of ambition,0.31229016
performing experience and fresh ideas he wanted to be involved in his many aspects of,0.07052504
the film as possible from directing to starring as the film's eponymous Charles Foster Kane,0.028326651
Welles filled out his production team with other talented men from Hollywood who were itching,0.105405
to experiment with their craft people like Gregg Toland a cameraman who contributed a lot,0.3956787
to the film's look and technical innovation and Welles is credited as co-writer with Herman,0.02784073
J mang kovitch a journalist who hopped over into the world of filmmaking and was,0.30542216
an experienced screenwriter by the time he worked on this project Citizen Kane tells the,0.05593542
life story of a wealthy newspaper magnate the first time we meet Kane he's on,0.061067022
his deathbed in a massive mansion called Xanadu dramatically murmuring his last word the story,0.16328096
is told in flashbacks through interviews with people Kane once knew like his friend and,0.08005506
fellow reporter Jedediah Leland his business manager mr. Bernstein and his second wife Susan Alexander,0.10416674
Kane in the last sequence of shots we find out that rosebud is referencing a,0.073959716
sled he had as a kid before he was separated from his family and sent,0.14441302
to boarding school with a new guardian so Citizen Kane could be a story about,0.08296563
well a lot of things a loss of childhood human flaws memory or the complications,0.15241414
of power and wealth film criticism is pretty subjective but Citizen Kane is also a,0.022982264
story that was influenced by real life specifically tycoons like the news mogul William Randolph,0.09505177
Hearst while Welles insisted the film wasn't meant to be a personal attack on Hearst,0.19175896
all of the parallels and the fact that mang kovitch was a former friend of,0.18503685
Hearst made him take the film real personally and when you have a buttload of,0.35543165
money and power over lots of news outlets your grudges become public fast initially RKO,0.08602662
and Orson Welles planned on debuting Citizen Kane at the Radio City Music Hall like,0.045054223
other big RKO movies but the venue turned it down eventually the film's release was,0.055353854
delayed until May 1st 1941 in New York and the critical reception was actually pretty,0.102960385
good a review by Kate Cameron published on May 2nd in the New York Daily,0.051780205
News called Citizen Kane one of the most interesting and technically superior films that has,0.08335396
ever come out of a Hollywood studio the controversy did mess with the film's commercial,0.07705192
success though it didn't gain much public traction until it was released again in the,0.040701248
1950s so part of what makes Citizen Kane memorable is that it was an ambitious,0.07356497
project headed by a maverick filmmaker and had a lot of drama around its release,0.10788501
we humans do love ourselves some drama but the content of the film speaks for,0.117865734
itself to the creators of Citizen Kane had the freedom to play and innovate many,0.053927146
of their technical experiments changed the way film was being used as a storytelling medium,0.08013537
which arguably could be another way to define greatness it takes a keen eye to,0.027945565
notice some of these tricks or at the very least some good commentary tracks a,0.06774653
lot of the innovation had to do with cameras Greg Tolin the cinematographer helped pioneer,0.05417905
the use of deep focus lenses so that everything in a scene is in focus,0.075234696
at once not just the foreground or the background Citizen Kane doesn't use focus to,0.041128896
guide your attention in a scene instead things like dialogue or movement draw your eye,0.13736448
to certain people at certain times it's very much like theater where Welles had honed,0.1363098
his directing and acting jobs they use perspective to surprise you like to mess with,0.27659592
your sense of scale when Kane walks toward a normal-looking background only to be dwarfed,0.15470932
by a huge window or fireplace it's a neat visual effect but it also punctuates,0.05887038
the story with a little metaphor you're seeing this man physically shrink into his environment,0.25261477
as he's losing control over his business and life and camera movements are combined with,0.08691577
other practical effects to really immerse you in the story take the scene where Cain,0.06759758
as a kid playing in the snow or his parents are inside a cabin and,0.1299628
talking about sending him away the camera pulls back through a window and eventually stops,0.11119789
on the other side of a dining table but from the final framing you can,0.081487685
see that the table would have been in the way of the movement the trick,0.09489903
is in the set it's actually a mechanical table that splits and comes back together,0.11891234
so the Me's onset is never broken and the scene can keep playing out you,0.10892076
the viewer are none the wiser because you're wrapped up in the incredible illusion of,0.1297135
the reality the film is constructed other practical tricks are used in the Enquirer office,0.059975542
where Cain's newspaper staff works these scenes were unusual for movies at the time because,0.057902806
there are visible ceilings now this doesn't sound that weird because you know normal office,0.07542994
buildings have ceilings but production teams usually stuck lights and sound equipment above their actors,0.08279084
heads so to keep the movie magic intact they had to keep ceilings out of,0.13342872
frame in this case the lights and microphones are still up there just hidden right,0.057052948
above the ceilings which are made of muslin sheets they also cut out chunks of,0.17031841
the floor to make room for the camera so they could get dramatic low angle,0.10125445
shots making the actors look larger-than-life the trick to Citizen Kane is that all these,0.26286617
effects which are everywhere don't feel like effects in the same way a CGI dragon,0.07663751
does they subtly draw you into the world for instance wells often blends mat drawings,0.14797133
with physical sets to make everything seem more immersive despite a limited budget this is,0.060519233
how they create the beginning of the film leading us toward the window of Xanadu,0.06495255
and Kane's death bed plus it's how they make the inside of Xanadu the outside,0.16154604
of the Inquirer Building and the audience's during the big campaign speech and opera these,0.056995284
tricks were accomplished with optical printers which let them shoot in light two images are,0.3741232
seen separately and stitch them into one effects also let them add visual twists to,0.070418455
the story in ways Wells couldn't with live theater like when Susan Alexander is performing,0.11425019
in the Opera we crane up from the stage and fade into the rafters to,0.073552296
see the operas production team reacting to how awful her performance is the transition is,0.23578751
precise and deliberate and nowhere near as easy as dropping a fade into a digital,0.10717073
video editor today now maybe you noticed some of these technical tricks but they're done,0.123001635
well not obvious unless you're paying close attention and that's one of the coolest things,0.08122711
about good filmmaking but a lot of the time what makes our favorite movies so,0.049282044
memorable is just a well-told story and if you think about it Citizen Kane doesn't,0.038823698
really have a mind-blowing plot it's a straightforward tale about a powerful wealthy newspaper tycoon,0.16997226
and his shortcomings and the dialogue is all pretty crisp and generic you get a,0.07792649
newsreel summary of Kane's life at the beginning but it's mostly told through flashbacks and,0.053689543
they're part of what makes the film feel so true to life and even though,0.050945576
it's easy to link Charles Foster Kane with William Randolph Hearst this archetype of a,0.07220188
driven powerful jerk who just wants people to love him is pretty relatable to a,0.79678434
lot of us even Welles himself so you might see things you like and hate,0.34062234
about yourself in Kane or Susan Alexander's naive optimism or Jedidiah Leland and his disillusionment,0.22856186
with a friend honestly the fact that it's his childhood sled isn't the most profound,0.10679813
or surprising twist out there it's not like they're hidden identities or I see dead,0.2403666
people but you have to admit the film goes all-in on the idea of lost,0.19738418
childhood Kane drowns his feelings and material objects and tries to live vicariously through Susan,0.2326826
Alexander's youth telling her we're going to be a great opera star or maybe you,0.084672526
agree with the film critic Pauline Kael that the sled is just kind of gimmicky,0.021125177
but critics including her don't call Citizen Kane great because it makes you realize profound,0.08014331
things about life the universe and everything every scene isn't a masterpiece but the film,0.07557464
holds up over time and people seem to get a lot out of it historically,0.08214994
technically or narrative Lee and like I mentioned before the whole idea of the best,0.04681626
film of all time is ultimately kind of silly it's more about understanding why and,0.4532772
how we make movies that mean so much to us or to the world and,0.09117277
that is pretty beautiful in itself next time we'll take a hard left turn into,0.1817711
an action-adventure horror film that's almost as quotable as Casablanca James Cameron's aliens and if,0.1525403
