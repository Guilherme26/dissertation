spotlight is the new film from Tom McCarthy is it worth your time let's find out hello everybody welcome to the gavai to show the show where I do the very difficult ass telling you other movies with your town on em deserve a spot in your movie collection as always I'm Asha today we're gonna be talking about spotlights so let's shine a little light on my review that was really bad so spotlight tells the true and shocking story of a group of reporters from the Boston Globe who banded together to uncover this huge scandal involving mass numbers of priests who were molesting children and it basically tells the story how they find that out how they investigate it and how they bring it into the public eye you know against the will empower of the church and I was really looking forward to this movie I loved the trailers I loved the cast I've been hearing great things I really didn't want to steal of the Cooper's last night so I was like this thing it's got it all now I've seen it I can report this thing not only does it God at all not only is it a fantastic film it is one of the best movies of the year this film is absolutely incredible and overall important this is the kind of dark subject matter that wow yeah it's uncomfortable this isn't something people like to bring up around teatime just like oh yes this net no but it's that kind of subject matter where pun incoming I feel like it needs a spot like put on it I feel like this is something that needs to be in the public eye it needs to be known in this movie does a great job of not only intriguing you and having a bowtie bukas that's interesting but informing you along the way in this movie is able to show that importance in such a perfect way where it's never like pointing the finger at religion saying hey yo this is your fault you did this it never does that because that would be stupid the movie instead only ever focuses on the problem at hand where it's focusing on how it happens why it happens the mentality behind it which is just disgusting it's scary when you hear about it and a huge emphasis on the effect it has on the victims in the long run they show you the victims in this movie it is tragic and heartbreaking to watch this is something that destroys lives and you see these guys in women just like yeah I survived it though so it's like it's tragic it's heartbreaking and it's legitimately scary especially when you see the mass numbers they find at the end of this movie they have a part in the end of this movie where they show all the cities they found like you know this activity happening in and the list was big enough that II my fear was going like all especially when we saw Denver Colorado up there because we live in Colorado we were like oh [ __ ] the performances in this movie are absolutely incredible everyone does good there's not a bag egg in the bunch Thea they all just transform into their characters and you buy them Michael Keaton is in this movie Michael Keaton kills it as always as this character Rachel McAdams is this movie she kills it as always Mark Ruffalo also kills it I'd say he was probably the stand out for me cuz you talking about transformations he was the one who went really really far into his character and I was just like blown away by Mark Ruffalo every time he was on screen I'm telling you there's going to be oscar noms thrown out for this movie and I'm thinking Ruffalo's gonna nab one of those I really do I mean honestly if I had anything bad to say about this movie it's just the fact it can be slowed a bit it can just be slow sometimes which is to be expected when you walk into a two-hour movie that's covering this subject material that being said never lost me this movie never lost my attention it's one of those movies that's so engrossing and interesting that once you start watching it you just you're in it you're in it you have to sometimes snap out it to remind yourself you're in a theater because it's one of those movies that can keep your attention from the second and opens to the second those credits roll and even with this movie a little bit afterwards so yeah applause so in the end spotlight is a fantastic film the movie it's got some dark touchy subject matter that can make some uncomfortable but I implore all of you to go see it because this is an important movie and a phenomenal one at that also I'm telling you when we get to award season I would be shocked if this thing was enough for the big prize of the Oscars and believe it or not even with all this oh hey that seems uncomfortable ash I'm sure you don't want to watch that again I kind of do day 1 by for me yeah day one just the performance is alone I went by in this movie they're worth seeing the movie for that alone story is intriguing it's interesting it's great it's great I just I want it I want I want it right there in the SS spotlight gets an a out of 10 hey everybody thank you so very much watching my video review
