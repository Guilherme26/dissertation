singing in the rain,0.049812276
so singing in the rain came out in 1952 and has gathered quite the reputation as being the best movie musical ever made,0.051598024
and while i wouldn't say it's the best it is pretty close singing that rain is just one of those musicals where every time i watch it,0.061344393
i'm blown away by the sheer amount of talent on and off the screen and it proves that jukebox musicals don't have to be bad,0.16721849
they just most of the time are now for those of you don't know jukebox musical is a musical where none of the songs are original they're pre-existing and how it usually goes is that they take a playlist of songs and then have to retrofit in a story to try to connect them and nine times out of ten it doesn't work,0.06887845
but singing in the rain is the one time but what is singing in the rain about,0.040867932
well it focuses on a period in history that doesn't often get talked about,0.051958833
and that's when hollywood had to transition from silent cinema to the talkies and that monumental year was 1927 with the jazz singer,0.054171212
the first movie to ever have synchronized dialogue even if it was just for the musical numbers but more specifically this story focuses on don lockwood played by gene kelly and he's this silent action hero douglas fairbanks type and it's kind of funny he's playing this type of character here because ever since i saw gene kelly in the three musketeers movie i always lumped him in with actors like errol flynn and tyrone power as these kind of swashbuckling adventurers not knowing of course that he's also one of the best tap dancers of all time,0.06873861
but it's still funny seeing him play,0.06022371
this,0.05212481
douglas fairbanks errol flynn type character in singing in the rain,0.0706783
and this is gene kelly's movie through and through he helped direct it he choreographed it and he is the star of this movie and all of his talents are on full display here his singing his acting and especially his dancing,0.122120135
i'm not exaggerating,0.09262896
when i say that this movie has some of the best tap dancing segments ever put to film but gene kelly's don lockwood does not carry this movie alone,0.08226398
he's also accompanied with his best friend,0.07930861
cosmo brown played by donald o'connor and not only is he talented enough to hang with gene,0.47746244
kelly's choreography,0.06518612
he's also the perfect comic for gene kelly's straight man,0.33851656
but their lives are not all sunshine and roses because you've also got lena lamont played by gene hagen and she is the thorn in the side of don lockwood this whole movie because she's convinced that she's a lot more talented than she actually is,0.2740739
and doesn't think that her voice is the most annoying thing on earth for heaven's sake what's the big idea can a girl get a word in edgewise,0.3530935
and what really gets under lockwood's skin is the fact that she's convinced that he's in love with her and wants to marry,0.13352147
her because according to cosmo she's irresistible she told him so herself but where the plot really gets going is when don lockwood meets kathy selden played by debbie reynolds and she's an aspiring actress she wants to go on broadway and she doesn't think too highly of movie actors but naturally a romance sparks between kathy and don and that of course makes lena jealous i know that's kind of a bare bones plot,0.116756484
but where this movie really excels is one the musical numbers which i'm gonna get to and two how they tell this other story at the same time of hollywood adapting to this new innovation called synchronized sound and it's a secondary story that makes singing in the rain,0.06478178
so entertaining as a movie from the very beginning you get the vibe that this movie doesn't try to accurately depict the 1920s as it was but more of a caricature of how it felt to be in the 1920s while at the same time poking fun at all the hypocrisy and just how fake hollywood culture was and still is and while the clothing and the personalities and the reactions are all very much exaggerated,0.4732155
the motivations are surprisingly authentic you get a good feel of the hesitancy,0.10483342
and then later frustration in trying to use this new talking picture technology and as someone who loves history especially film history,0.062820606
this is all really cool to see,0.07023355
but now let's talk about the part of this movie that actually matters,0.06544527
and why it got made in the first place the musical numbers,0.06988293
these musical numbers do not disappoint,0.07985337
and the first big musical number that we get is make them laugh,0.082705244
now make them laugh is important for a couple reasons,0.15016006
first of all,0.04131773
it's the first non-diegetic song that we get in this movie being a jukebox musical they usually make most if not all of the songs non-diegetic,0.18817821
i mean just look at mamma mia most of that movie is just people busting out into song and dance just because they feel like it,0.101356015
but seeing the rain takes a different approach,0.038020812
for instance,0.0587591
the first few songs that we get in singing in the rain are diegetic there are performances within the world that people are reacting to as if they were watching a show,0.18426736
and this makes make them laugh special because it's the first time in this movie where we see someone break out into song and dance and it's not a paid performance,0.11233401
but the other thing that makes make him laugh special is that,0.09080988
it's one of only two songs that were made specifically for this movie which might disqualify this as a jukebox musical but make him laugh is so similar to be a clown from the pirate that i still consider it basically a pre-existing work just one that's copyright friendly and who can't talk about make him laugh without talking about the a-plus slapstick from donald o'connor make him laugh as a master class in slapstick all the gags are there you got pratfalls you haven't getting hit in the head you have pretty much every form of physical comedy that you can imagine in this one number and it is fantastic,0.5024963
now the next song is you were meant for me,0.08344601
and this is the big love ballad between don lockwood and kathy selden and it's romantic and it's slow and it's dreamy and everything and it's good,0.12370959
but this is where trying to tell which songs are diegetic and which songs aren't is becoming a little more difficult,0.14372396
because in this song and while i'm thinking about it all the numbers in this movie are performed by characters who in the world know how to sing and dance,0.091974415
so it's not that big of a stretch when someone just starts expressing themselves in song and dance,0.10650588
when that character is established to be able to sing and dance,0.06259964
and if you need any more proof just look at lena lamont she can't sing can't dance and she gets zero song and dance numbers in this whole movie so following that logic i guess you could kind of classify all of these numbers as diegetic that they do exist in this movie even make them laugh,0.16906123
but i still call them nondiegetic because there's no official established source of the music where it's coming from,0.11645654
so i guess that's where i would draw the line but i don't know comment below,0.08101592
do you think that all the songs in this musical are diegetic and where do you draw the line,0.22654663
let me know but moving on to the next big number,0.06807262
we have my favorite song in the movie and this is the second and final song written originally for this movie and it's moses supposes and don't ask me why this is my favorite,0.059063263
i have no idea it just really made me laugh as a kid and still makes me laugh,0.1524874
today i just love seeing this proper british,0.13852124
dialect coach just get wrecked by the antics of cosmo and don and just like all the other numbers in this movie the tap dancing here is insane,0.46973452
it's so fast and with so much energy and man i just i wish i was that talented and speaking of insane choreography we then go on to good morning which this is the number where debbie reynold has to hang with the big boys and she's gone on record saying that she has no dancing experience,0.3078817
and she was basically starting from scratch when the rehearsal started how how can she nail this crazy choreography with zero experience,0.4125583
she found a new talent,0.1539352
i guess i mean between her and dick van dyke maybe more actors should just be thrown,0.79056245
into crazy choreography and see what happens you might get some really good dancers out of it,0.25573653
but i guess it can't be that hard to keep up when you're dressed like quicksilver from x-men but now we have the big finale climactic musical number broadway melody,0.15240534
this is the one where they threw all the money all the budget all the choreography all the effects and it makes absolutely no sense,0.10162718
and it's actually my least favorite number in the movie i know a lot of people like it,0.11436406
and it is impressive from a technical perspective,0.048795685
but let me explain the whole rest of this movie is so grounded in the world of the 1920s that it's created for itself,0.11582931
and like i explained earlier with diagesis it doesn't force you to suspend your disbelief so much because all the characters are actors and dancers and performers,0.09998573
so when they perform in a musical number it's not that weird,0.13269585
but all that goes out the window with broadway melody,0.102516286
i know that in the context of the story,0.027976083
it's framed where don lockwood is explaining the broadway melody segment to the producer because that's going to be,0.05482705
the big opening for the movie that they're trying to make within the movie but even that doesn't really hold up to scrutiny because what we know of the movie the dancing cavalier,0.124605194
so far it doesn't line up to what we're seeing in this segment sure it starts off similar enough,0.051143404
you have a young hoofer who's looking to star in a broadway show and everything and he's got big dreams but that's really where it ends,0.3972632
we don't see the sandbag hit him on the head we don't even really see him star in a broadway show,0.5917695
we just see this guy get picked up by an agent and then montage through him,0.24138315
you know getting higher up in the ranks of broadway,0.1376187
and then it takes a turn to the speakeasy and gangsters and gangster life,0.4943187
and this woman played by cerise who might be a wizard of oz type parallel to lena lamont,0.31089434
and i don't know it doesn't line up all that well and it just feels like an excuse to have gene kelly do his gene,0.13421063
kelly thing for 15 to 20 minutes which is way too long by the way and pardon me feels bad ragging on this segment because it is really impressive the sets look really cool the coloring the lighting the dancing and choreography,0.12214732
it's all really impressive and looks great but it does nothing to further the rest of the story which i guess wouldn't hurt so much if i wasn't so invested in this 1920s drama that was going on because again i love hollywood history but even so singing and reign is a fantastic musical and it is a testament to what jukebox musicals can be if they really tried the dancing is incredible the camera work is great,0.055011973
it's shot in long takes where you really get a sense of the choreography that's on display and all of the actors do a phenomenal job with the roles that they're given singing,0.19796777
and reign is just a classic movie musical that should be watched time and time again if you've never watched it check it out if you haven't seen in a while watch it again it's well worth the time,0.07504669
but now i turn over to you guys where do you draw the line of what is diegetic versus non-diegetic and singing in the rain,0.19397579
how much of it is in universe or just for the audience's benefit,0.03052195
i don't know,0.1465787
