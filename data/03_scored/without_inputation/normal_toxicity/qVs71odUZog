i cannot believe it is,0.07571698
finally time to review a quiet place part two to recap how this all went down for me a quiet place too was actually one of the very last movies that i got to see before lockdown,0.24030563
started,0.043882173
i did take,0.05832126
meticulous notes back then but there was just absolutely no way,0.04504636
i was reviewing a movie over a year after seeing it,0.09526292
good news though one i did get to see the movie again,0.079264
and even better news now the movie's still excellent you,0.08015492
all know how it can be with sequels,0.07084563
especially when you have an original movie that winds up being such a hit and success like that 2018 film you worry that making a sequel could maybe be pushing it too far and it can't possibly be as good as that first one right in this case though i really think it is the bulk of the story here takes place immediately after the events of that first film with the remaining members of the abbott family hitting the road after lee's death while out there they wind up with killian murphy's character emmett and you know what i'm just going to leave it at that that's really all you need,0.15547809
and i don't want to come anywhere close to spoilers on this,0.10649735
one focusing on story structure first here i kind of can't get over how well krazynski made it work,0.10385263
and in so many ways too for example part two very much felt like a major step forward for the main characters,0.058655705
and also a big step forward in the world building department and in how it fleshes out the state of the world,0.08701801
it is also very well worth noting,0.06297004
here,0.053441156
that krazynski opts to spend a good chunk of time in the past and with that material i'll just tell you that i jotted down a particular sequence in the film as a potential contender for one of the best set pieces of the year and it doesn't feel like a a hold on let me remind you what happened kind of moment,0.0661918
it is exceptionally well shot first of all and also perfectly paired with what we're dealing with and what the characters are going through in the present,0.08813133
the other thing,0.060462017
i really appreciated about how everything plays out here is how evelyn regan and marcus are are all on their own journeys in a sense even more so than in the first film it is a lot for one movie to handle,0.06756497
but krazynski pulls it all off via the script and then also in editing and i'll just tease that the editing really shines in the third act,0.12309351
there is one particular scene where you could just feel the structural choice that they made making all the difference in that moment just bringing together the themes of the film and the character growth and dare,0.022901239
i say that particular beat is kind of perfect,0.15192918
i think it's perfect,0.07067748
and then we've also got to talk about the sound design here again,0.031020751
i mean this movie better earn another academy award sound nomination,0.065483704
if you saw the first film this won't come as a surprise at all the design,0.09891707
enhances all of the scares and also bolsters every single character's experience,0.08712954
it is just endlessly exciting to me when you can hear every single stitch of sound in a movie used with such purpose,0.11138832
i will continue risk sounding like a broken record here by telling you that hey the cast is stellar yet again emily blunt no surprise is wonderful,0.15526688
but by design this is millicent simmons,0.070541054
and noah jups movie the two of them went through so much in that first film but jupe in particular has some really gut-wrenching moments in this one,0.06560488
and i felt for him,0.08401995
he is such an incredibly expressive actor who's giving so much every single second he's on screen and obviously that ability well supports,0.35199803
what marcus is building towards in these two films and then i just can't give millicent simmons enough credit for how good,0.1491055
she is in both of these movies but here in part two she is just a damn star i don't want to take away from the quality of her work in that first film at all because she certainly wowed me there,0.69542736
but part two gives her even more to do that elevates her from being a very important part of an incredible ensemble to really being a significant force driving the whole thing forward as for the aliens you do see them more in this one,0.08794084
and while i think the design is really solid admittedly again i did have that moment of going,0.040768165
oh they kind of look like a demogorgon,0.31089434
but i think that fades in a flash because you do have some really solid vfx here and also a movie loaded with super rich characters with an intensely powerful emotional core,0.11923053
if those characters believed in them so did i and that made a bit of a nitpick admittedly like similarities and character design just a fleeting thought for me,0.08645801
i'm going to go ahead and give a quiet place part two four and a half dewey's out of five on the dewey decima movie scale i think i am uh fully obsessed with this series,0.15153715
yet again,0.044999763
i walked away from this movie appropriately exhausted,0.09282119
some of the scenes in part two are probably the most stress inducing scares,0.06915006
i've seen in a good while and you guys know me i do love my scares and my sky high tension,0.18153086
but the real standout quality of a quiet place part two and something that i do think all sequels need is is how it takes a step forward thematically and also with such purpose,0.066619135
that first movie largely focuses on the immediate family raising kids,0.10591152
and giving them everything you've got and now this one shows the results of a strong parent-child relationship,0.15244026
and what a kid can do with the values passed down by a parent or a guardian figure,0.089720406
and then maybe how they can use those values,0.07519188
and those qualities to benefit others as well clearly i think this movie was incredibly well done i highly recommend you see it,0.13225102
and when you do hit the comment section below tell me what you thought of it again,0.108486444
i i hope you enjoy it as much as i did but if you didn't that's all good too tell me about it in the comments i love hearing what you guys think about these movies whether you agree with me or not,0.10877139
but again i can't say enough good things about a quiet place part 2 big fan of this franchise,0.07665326
