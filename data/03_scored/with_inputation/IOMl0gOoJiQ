after waiting for two solid years to finally see the next chapter in the Star,0.05257951
Wars saga this is what Lucasfilm gave us now the real question is has Disney,0.06976021
ruined Star Wars I faith that's the question that all of us fans are asking,0.18228608
right now and at the end of this video I will answer that question so,0.08788797
let's go ahead and talk about the good the bad and the really bad so,0.15193987
a reloj is real its cannon tell you guys the truth I think reloj was,0.17310297
my favorite part of this whole entire movie I asked Lee loved how they were,0.10316025
communiqu√© for the force and their little conversations that they had with each other I,0.07091136
thought that was really well done and there was so much like almost like sexual,0.5154597
tension between the two of them and you could just like really feel their chemistry,0.111217916
and I think that part was really well done I also really loved the throne,0.06048584
room scene and I think that that whole part was played out really well I,0.08300377
like how kylo and Rey teamed up together against the Red Guards I also like,0.13449278
at the beginning when Rey shows up and really feels like that they're still good,0.060225822
and Ben solo obviously and she you know is trying to convince him that you,0.096909426
know he's still good inside I really feel like that Rey and kylo had this,0.11598481
Anakin and Padme moment at that part it really reminds me of Revenge of the,0.0916714
Sith had my actions conversation the last conversation they ever had together and it really,0.06568724
just reminded me of that part I wanted to talk about was the porks I,0.12941325
really loved the porks they were hysterical and they were just so adorable I also,0.24246487
loved the parts of Chewbacca and the porks it was really cute when she Baca,0.3237605
was going to go and eat one of the porks cooked and all the porks,0.32965314
were looking at him and they were kind of like crying and whining about it,0.43078017
and Chewbacca like out that very moment became like vegan I love how he took,0.12007669
all of the porks and and put them on the ship and how he was,0.31376794
just kind of like a crazy pork lady how evolved in your characters I have,0.62679845
to say rose and Paige were the two who stood out the most to me,0.08658358
I really wish that they would have had a bigger part in this whole movie,0.07441166
and I think Paige died way too quick it was a really emotional you know,0.19074358
the way she sacrificed herself but we didn't even get to know this character she,0.14694504
was just kind of there and gone and that kind of sad me I gave,0.08286369
love rose to I really like throws she was probably the best a new character,0.06727604
out of all and I really just want so much more rows and we're depth,0.07541951
to her character and to just learn more about her and we really didn't learn,0.07772603
too much stuff about rows and that kind of bothered me because I felt like,0.13068591
she deserved to have more depth to her character so now let's get on to,0.15326308
the bad so one of my biggest problems of this movie was that there were,0.15251878
way too many characters and there just wasn't enough time nor story to really present,0.058340445
all these characters to us correctly they introduced way too many new ones who were,0.0870742
completely unnecessary like Laura Dern's character like nothing against these actors or actresses but her,0.15539132
character was so unnecessary and DJ the character he was just there was no point,0.055944618
to him they're literally wishes no sense either one of their characters I really feel,0.1460968
like that they should had been the movie I just feel like that they just,0.072223365
took up way too much time and these these older characters that we got to,0.063562565
meet in the force awakens we literally just met these characters two years ago this,0.06512987
is the second chapter and the sequel trilogy and we still barely even know anything,0.08156032
about these characters we hardly know if we bought PO we hardly know if he,0.07303635
bought fed we absolutely don't really have a clue who write even is and now,0.10055045
they're already showing us introducing us these new characters but you guys haven't even effort,0.14506914
the characters that have already been previously written and it just drives me nuts because,0.31089434
I only know so much more about these characters I'm so excited to see these,0.09581488
characters just grow and to really get to know them on a whole new different,0.054142103
level like we have in the past Star Wars movies and here I just feel,0.0554691
like that all the older characters have just gone the boo and moved to decide,0.09231928
for these new characters and then there's a storyline I the whole storyline is just,0.046003822
really all over the place it's really weak it really has no point chia-wei it,0.14123324
can't feel like that the resistance is just sitting around in their spaceship and they're,0.106981084
just crying and whining about how to force the first eye don't speak because I'm,0.2698742
I'm still flustered by this whole entire thing anyway there's really no point of this,0.10428447
storyline it just drags on and on and on so now let's move on to,0.086752005
Luke so we eat wave for two years to see what's great to happen between,0.07993579
ray and Luke when ray gives Luke his old lightsaber and guess what Luke does,0.07891943
he just froze over his shoulder and he's just like yeah okay whatever screwless I,0.4920853
don't know who you are I'm done I don't want this thing yeah see you,0.3155131
later go to hell I'm done type of attitude and it was just so ridiculous,0.76869035
I don't know if it was made to be sunny but when he heard a,0.054280926
lightsaber I was just like are you serious like opening one gave you that lightsaber,0.11058767
like if that was your dad's lightsaber that lightsaber has seemed sooo much just crazy,0.6364068
stuff and it should mean so much to Luke and he just threw it away,0.113112405
like it just meant absolutely nothing to him and another fee that really bothered me,0.08742035
was that Luke like abandoned layi it was like Leia SH trying to hold together,0.29580656
the resistance and you know Hans gone Ben's turned to the dark side Luke has,0.08489195
just completely ran away and Leia is out here the only one who's like trying,0.13500956
to make things right and trying to you know just she's the one who's trying,0.09632357
to make any effort and Luke just kind of like abandoned her and like I,0.05730431
know like he was going to like frickin kill her son and he's really ashamed,0.8785311
of that and he's like probably felt like he could face her but it's like,0.2426469
like it was there for you what you were going through how's Luke like I,0.08670435
just that really upset me because I feel like Luke would have never have like,0.05282268
a banded leia like that next thing is yeah Luke never really trained right right,0.15369953
how absolutely like no training whatsoever and that was one of the things I was,0.08485717
really looking forward to this movie was Luke training right and there was like absolutely,0.06237083
no training and I just saw you understand how how stiva call away with doing,0.108209714
that Rey was already like relief for sensitive she could like do all this stuff,0.07195353
everyone saying she's like a Mary Sue and I thought oh you know next movie,0.09181969
you know like lukla train her and she'll becoming more powerful and like Luke does,0.07361251
even really trainer none of that really happens as I kind of wanted maybe like,0.052588787
a light saber fight between Luke and Rey and them like training and we didn't,0.04009077
really even get that and that was really disappointing and I just feel like that,0.11794636
whole part was just so overlooked and you know that whole part where Luke is,0.030829359
like this is a good go the way you think it is yeah I kind,0.12225304
of feel like Luke was saying that to everyone in the audience at the movie,0.03343008
theater like it was just so polite anyway he said that and we're all sitting,0.0574194
there it's like at this this whole movie has not gone the way we thought,0.07659636
it was going to go okay so now we're going to dive into the really,0.077973664
bad so one of the things that really really irked me was Finn's character I,0.13191861
love Finn he was really also force awakens but Ike I just feel like that,0.08939461
Dave just kind of turned Finn into just kind of a useless idiot and he,0.95947874
has so much potential and everyone has just been calling him to space janitor and,0.10398973
I just think that's so sad I don't think Lucasfilm even knows what to do,0.10777853
of his character I feel like Poe was just running around like a chicken with,0.25465816
its head cut off I just feel like that his character was so all over,0.34691617
the place and knowing that this was Carrie Fisher's last Star Wars movie uh it,0.058706127
it just really really makes me sad to tell you guys the God's honest truth,0.09488883
and the whole part when the ship blows up and leg gets blown out and,0.3268778
she's kind of flowing through space and then we all think oh my gosh you,0.31696403
know it's just how they're going to kill Carrie Fisher off and then you know,0.6050522
she opens her eyes or whatever and she uses the force to go to the,0.14970115
other ship and they rescue her and save her I really don't know how to,0.14382589
feel about that part when it first happened I was really pissed like okay like,0.23992987
is this how you know this is how Leia is going to die and then,0.53490317
you know she survives for the rest of the movie but I still just don't,0.08406935
know how to feel about that part and of course Captain phasma we thought that,0.15447308
she'd get a bigger part in this movie as we were all hoping and praying,0.1304217
for and fast mom was treed even worse in this movie than she was in,0.30530402
the previous movie she was killed off which really really upset me she was such,0.44431564
a awesome character and she died so it was just so poorly put together how,0.11951022
she died and you know maybe she's not really dead maybe she's gonna pop back,0.43307087
up into the next movie but again they just they just treated her like garbage,0.72947335
and they kind of just cast her aside like they did in force awakens and,0.15277947
one of the most shocking deaths and movie would have to be Snoke I really,0.22272946
have no idea why the heck they killed Snoke off we had absolutely no idea,0.59316486
who he was where he came from why he was so strong with the force,0.07781366
when it's a train Ben solo it really just made absolutely no sense and again,0.08875693
Snoke seems like such a necessary character and he was killed off so quickly it,0.46971884
was ridiculous and I would probably we will probably never even know who he was,0.5154597
or why he was doing these things they also hinted at the gray Jedi and,0.080873005
that just kind never came about either and I guess that they just completely forgot,0.074016295
about the Knights of Ren which they teased in the force awakens and Rey's vision,0.053569965
I have no idea what happened to those guys they were never mentioned again they,0.15398307
kind of just disappeared and that really shocked being that they kept that really important,0.083634876
plot line out the whole part when Rey and kylo are talking and race says,0.14874648
that she saw his future which we never got a glimpse into that I think,0.28345743
it would be cool if we could have seen kylos future a little bit for,0.12485323
Ray's eyes but of course they just decided to skip over that too and then,0.081781395
the part where kylo tells right you know I know who your parents are they,0.08082282
sold you for drinking money and he's like you know the truth of race like,0.2564047
yeah I know the truth and I personally feel like that Kyla was biessing ray,0.12970196
I really feel like he was lying to her and trying to throw her off,0.3951065
and making her feel like she was a nobody but I really don't think that,0.16733477
that's the actually truth of her parents I think that they were trying to throw,0.24074605
all of us fans off and save it for the big finale for episode 9,0.06270397
the one really emotional part of the story was that both ray and kylo both,0.04679728
feel abandoned and alone and I think that they both could really relate to each,0.02144176
other on that level and when kylo says you know you're a nobody but you,0.7093121
know you mean something to me that type of thing you could just really see,0.0899009
how they're both are hurting so much and how that's stuffy that draws them together,0.3000156
because they both have experienced that pain it really is disappointing that there was a,0.11761271
proper lightsaber battle I really wanted there to be a showdown between kylo and Luke,0.091211244
I really just wanted them to just see them fight it out and to just,0.17184146
have this really epic lightsaber battle and we really did not kept that we got,0.06449744
the Luke force per jet projection thing I cannot pronounce words today I am sorry,0.06705536
I and that's pretty much what we got and it was really interesting moment it,0.06890255
was really different for me feel so you've seen before we never knew that this,0.09772443
power existed that Luke could do this but still I just kind of wanted a,0.02226962
traditional lightsaber battle in place of that again it was no casing it was enjoyable,0.08002151
and yeah so probably the most iconic death of this movie would be Luke Skywalker,0.24216689
I kind of had a feeling bites him the end of the movie that he,0.24146862
would turn into a force ghost and he would disappear just like how obi-wan did,0.34986323
and of course that was the case I got super emotional at that moment I,0.06253887
know my mom was really super emotional too you know to see Luke Skywalker born,0.1290685
on screen and then to see him die on screen it was a very emotional,0.30821827
moment just seeing his life of the character and stuff and knowing that he has,0.07537228
passed and of course he's going to show up in Episode nine as a force,0.10350371
ghost we all know that he'll be back but again it was still really interesting,0.10130645
seeing the two suns setting and it wishes a very emotional moment now finally has,0.05263323
Disney ruined Star Wars personally I don't think that they've ruined the whole franchise I,0.10590251
think that they've just really screwed up with this movie again glass Jedi it's not,0.31089434
a bad movie but it's not exactly a good movie however and I would have,0.14371203
to admit that this is my least favorite Star Wars movie out of all of,0.09088802
them yes I would have to say I prefer to film Menace over the last,0.113973506
Jedi but I don't know maybe as time passes and I watch - Jedi a,0.054128267
few more times it may end up really growing on me when I first saw,0.11696371
the force awakens I absolutely hated that movie and after giving me a second chance,0.15428893
and watching it a few more times is now one of my favorite Star Wars,0.06467414
movies so maybe the last Jedi will grow on all of us and we will,0.11805043
look at it be more positive about it but I really think that Lucasfilm really,0.04536532
needs to take a step back and think again before giving Rian Johnson you know,0.14874153
giving him his own trilogy to work on I don't want to blame Ryan for,0.14722547
the whole entire movie because it seems more like the script in the writing of,0.052073617
the story seemed to be more of the problem than the directing was so maybe,0.08187375
Ryan was at fault at all it was just the writers and stuff but at,0.06353744
