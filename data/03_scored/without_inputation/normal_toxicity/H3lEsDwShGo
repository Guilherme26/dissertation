universal monster movies you've got the Wolfman The Mummy you got the Frankenstein monster or,0.559217
Dracula and The Creature from the Black Lagoon all ready to roll around well first,0.07600058
I decided to kick this series off by looking at a movie that I've actually,0.22933231
seen many times and I've been wanting to review for quite some time and I,0.058705665
figured now because anytime than ever I'm gonna be looking at the cabinet of dr.,0.05776182
Caligari this movie came out in 1920 and I'm attack as you as I as,0.3818848
you can tell it'll be celebrating its 100th anniversary next year now this movie is,0.04211052
significant in a lot of ways to meet on a personal level it's actually the,0.057359807
first silent movie that I ever saw now I must have been in middle school,0.083197385
when I first saw that I was just channel surfing one day and I turned,0.0690525
onto a local PBS or Public Broadcasting assistant station my father I was about 10,0.055140134
minutes into it and I was hooked right up until the end I mean I,0.11991797
had heard of silent movies and even my mom had a book that had stills,0.13472268
from my family the Opera and way down east and a bunch of other but,0.13533822
it never clicked with me that these movies were silent with just you know music,0.12725057
and title cards and everything until I actually saw one of these movies so I'm,0.08526755
not quite sure why it held my attention at such a young age I don't,0.15942203
know if it the imagery or the suspense of this movie or the fact that,0.06949432
I was actually watching a silent movie for the first time I don't know the,0.090597324
captain of dr. Caligari is a German a psychological and thought provoking silent film about,0.24723582
Francis he's a young man who visits a travelling fair that just arrived in his,0.063003644
hometown he visits it with his friend Helen and while there they see this sideshow,0.09112039
staged for a hypnotist named dr. Caligari played by Warner Krauss and his act is,0.14914857
basically he has a Sonam beuliss which is a sleepwalker named Caesar he's played by,0.12699418
conrad veidt and wakes caesar up and he can tell your future and any other,0.11652785
questions that you might have but at night Caligari uses him to commit murders what,0.4234296
is striking about this movie is of course the visual look of this film the,0.092950046
sets the makeup the costumes are done to reflect the madness of the mind of,0.18029422
the person telling the story using art directors from Germans film expressionist movement it has,0.06646274
a very dark and twisted visual style of you know the sets and both indoors,0.3316362
and outdoors are twisted they are slanted or misshapen the chairs are very high shadows,0.2669022
are painted on the sets along the walls the floors that you know all kinds,0.056585934
of places with the performances I thought that both Krause and I gave very chilling,0.12781076
performances as Caligari and Caesar especially you know just from their movements and even their,0.064766586
facial expressions especially when Caligari has Caesar awake for the first time now some say,0.115530595
that the acting may be over-the-top but keep in mind you know that these actors,0.09525381
had to convey emotions visually and since these films are closer to be shown to,0.06536577
different countries with different languages everybody can understand a feeling or doing it visually the,0.09491101
movie itself I've seen it quite a number of times and it always keeps me,0.066436306
on the edge of my seat and always keeps me guessing and then has twists,0.07774725
and turns that you may not see coming and although I see this movie more,0.15171067
as a horror movie some have made the argument that this is actually an anti,0.149118
Authority film with dr. Karl Caligari representing the German war government and Caesar represents the,0.17710756
conditioned Man like soldiers are trained basically to kill which kind of makes sense the,0.2822972
census movie did come out at the end of World War 1 and I found,0.14315438
out that the writers of the movie were actually passing this now what could be,0.057840582
said about this movie that hasn't already been said it's been called the first horror,0.1849864
film it's been called the first arthouse film you can definitely sense its influence in,0.07095527
horror movies especially with the universal monster movies that came out in the 1930s and,0.24201514
the 1940s like for example terrible things will happen if you visit a traveling fair,0.13713767
like you see in murder and rude morgue with Bela Lugosi or the Wolfman with,0.5876557
Lon Chaney jr. the wooden box that the pale and darkly dressed Caesar lays and,0.11363507
kind of reminds me of Dracula with Bela Lugosi or when Caesar is lovestruck with,0.13554491
the leading lady of the film instead of killing her he abducts her kind of,0.74527305
like Frankenstein with Boris Karloff and of course you know I can see how this,0.12189071
this influenced him burned with some of his work as well I think the cabinet,0.24646819
of dr. Caligari is a must-see movie for all kinds of movie audiences including not,0.062084608
only silent films but horror mystery suspense and even thought-provoking and complex art house movies,0.129897
I think that for movie that soon to be a hundred years old it still,0.08549266
packs a very scary and chilling pun the visuals are great the performances are great,0.11215376
I think that this movie is still compelling all right well that's my take on,0.11092969
the cabinet of dr. Caligari if you have seen this movie what did you think,0.10039346
