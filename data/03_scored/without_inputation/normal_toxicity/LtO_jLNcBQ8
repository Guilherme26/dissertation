today,0.02486971
I'm reviewing the brand new Netflix movie Roma,0.069678895
I feel like I'm one of the last people on YouTube to review this because so many people have seen it but it's finally on Netflix,0.07375968
it's a movie that I wanted to watch in theaters,0.10210223
it's not in a theater near me yet but it will be next week,0.105642885
and I will absolutely be watching this again in a theater,0.076925926
but first we have to talk about it premiering on Netflix if you guys don't know how my reviews work,0.12224093
I like to talk about the good the bad and then give you my score,0.17196102
this is a non-spoiler review later on today,0.07632606
I'm reviewing the brand new episode of Titans,0.07245798
I'm watching season 8 I believe of Voltron and I have a review for the mule tomorrow is Aquaman,0.18510807
but before we can get into all of those things,0.065659195
we are talking in Romo my goodness,0.09369622
let's get into this,0.12422935
so Romo is a story that chronicles a year in the life of a middle class family in Mexico City in the early 1970s,0.06457986
now when I first watched this trailer,0.0567577
I didn't know that was the premise I didn't know this was something that was based in more realism,0.10305497
I thought it could be potentially this alternate world with these wars that are going on in the background cuz,0.15976016
I watched that first trailer,0.051589116
I'm like this could be trippy this could be like children of men,0.4559958
the other movie that Alfonso Kuran directed a movie that I just watched a few months ago and my goodness does that thing still hold up,0.08375742
it's a fantastic film,0.07887617
he's a fantastic director so I knew the directing and the technical aspects would be well done and they weren't just,0.038309593
well done,0.0436697
I let's get into this this may be one of the most beautiful and emotionally satisfying not satisfying in the way that you think just from a visual and audible standpoint movie I have seen all year,0.09529183
and in a long time,0.078121595
Romo is just a triumph in terms of filmmaking,0.09406366
the way that the camera follows these characters it puts you in the moment the way that the camera pans from left to right right to let the unique style,0.09888127
the shot selection the use of wides,0.16054182
I love a good wide shot especially when we're talking about action scenes this is not the film for that,0.15035973
but what roma does is it uses these wide shots and it doesn't necessarily focus on the character that we're supposed to be looking for the film allows us to find that character,0.0646179
it allows us to focus on first of all what we want to focus on,0.084789656
but second of all you slowly start to realize what the film wants you to look at and I love how he does that scene after scene after scene and every single time I'm looking at one of these scenes whether it's a wide shot or a tracking shot or a pan I'm sitting there thinking this is just some of the best cinematography that I've ever seen,0.12364527
now I believe if this movie was in color,0.076942906
I don't know if it would have worked as well it would have been beautiful,0.12408897
it would have been a technical masterpiece that it is right,0.05140746
now I just think the use of black and white a very gray thoroughly color corrected black and white a beautiful and that was an incredible artistic choice I love that he went for that and it just allowed me to see even more beauty in these scenes than I would have seen if it was corrected with actual color now I'll get into the first hour in my negatives it's not necessarily a negative,0.1142362
it's just the one thing towards the film where I was like,0.058950275
I don't know if I love this,0.0866993
I don't know if I see what people are talking about because so many people are calling this movie a masterpiece and they're like,0.1101524
oh my gosh Roma,0.14203642
I saw the trailer,0.06864659
I was intrigued,0.046611357
I couldn't wait to watch this film but throughout the first hour I sat there thinking what is the point of all this I saw the beauty in it and I saw the technological masterpiece that everyone's talking about but I didn't really feel that connection that I was supposed to feel for some of these characters,0.04881294
and especially our lead here who is absolutely fantastic,0.13179877
she should be nominated for every award and even though I didn't get emotionally connected to her at the beginning I slowly started to realize what the hype was all about and I hope you guys feel the same way,0.09725367
I hope you continue to get locked in throughout the story and then by the last 3045 minutes you are completely hooked by the emotional aspects,0.26782706
and just the way that this story goes,0.04074394
it's not predictable,0.084642105
it takes directions that you don't anticipate I expected certain really epic things to happen in this movie and I did not get that I got a real story with real characters,0.085151486
a real family things going on in the background but the focus always remains on our lead,0.058673277
and Cleo was a beautiful character,0.053915422
and I loved every aspect of her story especially once you get into that last 30 minutes at the hour and 30 minute,0.07871837
mark is really when the movie went full gut punch and I lost it,0.29019633
I absolutely lost,0.14796181
it watching this film I'm sitting on my couch,0.2890856
this is the first time all year I've truly gotten emotional,0.05256933
and maybe it's just that story element I'm not going to spoil what it is maybe that just resonated with me I won't spoil anything about it,0.08869508
but because I have a lot of friends going through that portion of their lives and to see that happen with this character that I have had an hour and a half to just kind of sit there and grow attached to and to see everything that she's went through that the families went through that she's went through with the family and then that happens and you are left with this emotional hole inside of your stomach,0.30241317
and it's like,0.056826584
I said the first time I've sat there and truly had tears in my eyes all year and it was just an incredible incredibly sad but an incredible filmgoing experience but it wasn't just that it's the beginning even the first hour when I was like okay can we pick it up just a little bit,0.13833405
I was still sitting there just feeling something this odd strange feeling that I've not felt in a long time I was getting emotional over the film making not even the story not even where it was headed just how beautifully made this film was was getting me emotional,0.08194115
and then the gut punch happens within the plot that got me emotional,0.28479815
and then that final scene where the family is on vacation that's all I'm going to say my goodness,0.090706564
I mean there's nothing I can say that can really put that experience into words you guys just have to watch it and experience it for yourself and it all comes down to how you feel about what's going on on screen when they're at the beach towards the end I related to that because my family and I that's some of the best memories that I have is me and my family walking on the beach on our family vacations and you can just feel the water brush up against your feet when you're walking on the beach,0.05882461
you feel the heat of the Sun and that captured that perfectly you could see the Sun radiating even though the films in black and white you could feel it,0.010412377
you could get attached to it,0.0898165
you were attached to the family at the time and all of that playing with what has happened to me in my lifetime the back story if you will it was just way too much for me personally,0.07080367
but in the best way possible it really hit me hard towards the end,0.469563
and Roma is just a spectacle in all aspects and don't put words in my mouth I'm not saying the first hour is bad,0.27792862
it's not bad it's beautiful it's good and even the story is well done,0.06851709
it's just the pacing was a little slower than I anticipated,0.11569583
I thought it would move a bit faster especially with koron behind the lens but it clearly did its job getting me invested in this character,0.057648104
and then once that third act hits or even the second half of the film that's when I really started to realize why people are saying this movie is a masterpiece,0.0840343
and I think I agree with them,0.040451128
I think Roma is an absolute masterpiece everything that happens is just so realistic there are even mistakes that the characters make and Kuran just probably said you know what we're gonna leave that in because it captures the moment it captures what would actually happen and it made it so much better than it could have been then we have all of the stuff happening in the background whether you're talking about the riots or the war or even the family aspect,0.06946043
those things come to a head,0.28149262
and when they do it's beautiful,0.07431398
but the focus always remains on clay,0.09142302
it's always told from her point of view the camera just kind of sits back and watches this it becomes detached from this reality and allows us to look in it feels like a documentary at times because everyone while they're unknown actors we don't know any of these at what you guys might,0.06603772
but I didn't know any of these actors they're still so good,0.082742035
there are award-worthy,0.10280285
this cast was incredible the kids were wonderful the emotion was just constantly in your face but not in your face to where it was annoying,0.5260164
it was in your face because you can't help but to get emotional watching everyone go through these tragedies and then the beauty inside of it and finding things to make you happy at a time of either loss or sadness,0.14106429
there are beautiful themes within here,0.05639587
so many layers to this movie that's why I said before I can actually settle on whether or not it belongs in my top 10,0.07610311
top 5 top 3,0.06327162
I have to see the film again,0.038505897
because while I do truly believe it's the best made film of the year,0.054351795
I don't necessarily know if it's my favorite,0.061644718
I don't know if it has that rewatch ability but regardless that takes nothing away from how well-made,0.091824464
I think the film is because once again I think this is the most well-made movie of 2018 Netflix congratulations you did it and anyone who tells me oh this is a Netflix movie,0.053813044
they're not going to get nominated for an Oscar because it's a film of string on the streaming platen,0.10704046
if you think this doesn't deserve to get nominated because it's on Netflix just get out,0.15387203
you don't belong in this industry,0.29549074
you don't deserve to have a place in film criticism,0.23696242
you don't even belong on YouTube go home shave your head stick in the toilet and flush it just keep flushing,0.5876557
it until the water just keeps filling up and then you remove your head and you're like wow it does deserve to get nominated for an Oscar,0.5519711
nothing I said made sense,0.06859102
but I'm angry I've just been seeing people online that are saying oh this doesn't deserve to get nominated because it's on Netflix to piss off anyway,0.52113223
let's talk about the negatives to Romo,0.080653526
I really don't have very many because the filmmaking was almost perfect from a technical aspect,0.120845184
it's all just some of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen the cinematography I'm a big cinematography guy so I love all of that where are the negatives Austin get into the negatives,0.10460277
the only thing,0.09602896
I have to say about this movie that really bothered me is the first hour was very slow,0.16620441
now I do usually complain about movies being slow it's usually my big critique,0.111467026
but I think the reason that it bothers me so much right now is because I was so in love with the second hour of the film and I was so in with these characters,0.06413338
I just didn't feel that way about the first half I still think it's beautiful,0.107781656
I still think it's amazing,0.07572955
I just wanted to be a little bit more onboard and less Hospital and I thought it was going to be,0.11452762
and also I'll say this this does not apply to me but for someone who is watching this movie that doesn't love like the artsy fartsy aspects of a film,0.19552287
they don't enjoy artistic elements and they're not really into the super realistic style movies if you don't like following a family on a journey if you're in it for say action or something that you think is going to happen towards the end,0.072955586
that's like oh my,0.07982591
gosh,0.10844589
it's the most mind-blowing moment of 2018,0.15319444
I don't know if you're going to love Romo,0.15316932
I don't know if you're going to appreciate it as much as I do and that's okay,0.19304644
you don't have to appreciate it like I do you can have a completely different opinion for me I then Roma did everything that I needed it to do and more it's so bit of the fact that it's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in the last decade is an incredible incredible feat,0.08804038
and that's one of the reasons why I love it so much all of those things being said that one minor critique is keeping Roma away from a perfect score for me,0.07425374
and I did not anticipate giving this movie this high of a score twenty five minutes into the movie but when that thing was over and I was wiping the water out of my,0.0936151
I'm not afraid to tell you guys that listen,0.14497472
I don't get super emotional during movies a lot of the time I get emotional,0.10038385
but I don't show it I showed it this time I was sitting on my couch thankfully by myself just sitting there with tears coming out of my eyes because it was so so beautiful Roma is a feat it's monumental,0.2402209
and that is why I'm going to give this movie as close to perfect as I ever thought a 98% the highest score I've ever given a movie on Netflix one of the highest scores,0.08129007
I have given all year,0.020387482
Roma is absolutely incredible,0.031844962
and while it may not be my favorite of the year it's absolutely the best and most well-made movie of 2018,0.06250761
thank you guys,0.045313165
