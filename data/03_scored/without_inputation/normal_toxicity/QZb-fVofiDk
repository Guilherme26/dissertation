so this is a semi Chinese movie written and directed by a Lulu Wang and I say semi Chinese because there is a fair bit of English in it too and story here follows this young woman living in New York whose family decides to fly back to China under the pretense of a wedding and she decides to join them,0.14911418
although the real reason for them going is something else entirely,0.052863777
it's a bit of a secret they're keeping and something they feel I could do more harm than good if it got out,0.3157078
so the movie basically follows this family as they have a bit of a reunion and in the middle of it all is this young woman who is a bit torn on the whole idea of keeping a secret,0.14953198
she's not convinced it's for the best but she doesn't want to go against her family either,0.15155776
that's the basic premise here and to be fair I was a little bit underwhelmed by it mainly because I've heard a lot of good things about this one it's been very well received but I'm not that convinced by it,0.09369371
now don't get me wrong,0.123994626
this is by no means a bad movie in fact I liked it,0.15236418
but the story here was a bit underwhelming to me it's very very simple,0.24228507
it's all about this family and the secret they're keeping and that's it,0.077342376
there's just nothing more to it,0.1003625
and it didn't feel like it really went anywhere either like your plot itself almost feels non-existent,0.11360693
it's just all about the characters and their whole family dynamic,0.062868
it doesn't feel like anything really happens and it doesn't really go anywhere,0.06737699
which I guess could be fine but I didn't really even get the point,0.04117371
though the main characters are and her whole storyline about her life in New York and whatnot and I don't think it's really dug into the other characters very much either,0.063758574
it does give most of them a little bit of depth,0.08519575
they all feel unique and different but that's about it,0.075533375
they didn't really go very much deeper than that,0.055531282
and yeah at the end of the day I guess I just didn't really get the point of it all I mean the movie is about family and about what people do to protect their loved ones or what they think is protecting them,0.056584567
even if that means lying and deceiving and how they justify that to themselves and the people around them but beyond that I just don't really know what I was supposed to take away from this,0.14487486
however as I said I still didn't like it,0.08782554
it's still a perfectly enjoyable movie I thought it was pretty funny at times too it's also well act,0.08955455
then the pacing wasn't bad either although it didn't really feel like it went anywhere but it didn't drag or feel long,0.05079536
so I guess it did something right,0.06720863
it's also a very good-looking a well-directed movie I also liked how they used the music in this,0.06686141
and thought the editing worked very well they utilized a lot of hard cuts which can sometimes feel a bit abrupt,0.099955045
but in this it worked,0.05015243
oh and the grand mind is is absolutely adorable,0.068029925
I liked her a lot,0.09040989
so yeah beyond the story stuff and a general plot which I wasn't completely sold on I did end up liking just about everything else and genuinely don't have any real complaints about it,0.05319638
and you know what it did have this certain charm to it as well it's a very charming movie with a lot of heart and some touching moments as well and I'm guessing that's really the reason,0.09608732
so many people have liked this as much as they have it's probably also most of the reason I didn't really mind it either but did I personally think it's great no but it's most definitely not bad either,0.050335824
however would I recommend it sure I mean I think most people will find something to like about it,0.06550881
so you know maybe give it a look or don't after all,0.063925944
I'm not your dad,0.24004465
but hey what are your thoughts on this have you seen it,0.07974732
