sending it now that I will probably butcher all the Japanese pronunciations throughout this video hey I'm Amy and welcome or welcome back and today I will be checking the Seven Samurai awfully 1001 movie checklist if you do not know what the one tells my movie checklist or 1001 movie challenge it it is basically a challenge I'd give myself to watch every single movie from the UN types of movies you must see before you die book so far I have chucked 161 movies off the list if you win no more and you can check out a playlist with my intro video up there I'm also an Amazon affiliate so if you'd like to start the challenge for yourself watch the movie I talked about today or watch the movie for next week you can check out the links in the description and if you purchase anything from there I'll get a little bit of a kickback and I'll make this channel so much better as always let's get started with a short summary a poor village recruits seven unemployed samurai to protect and teach them how to defend themselves against oncoming bandits everything culminates with a battle between the village the samurai and forty bandits this has been a movie I have been waiting so long to watch I don't know why I waited so long for it it has been probably six years since I first heard about this movie I think it was six years it was around 2012-2013 when I first heard about this while taking a world history film class or a class on the history of film in different countries I don't remember the name of the class but we started studying Japanese films and we watched movie getsu which I absolutely loved and we talked a little bit about Seven Samurai and Akira Kurosawa but not like super in-depth as I probably would have wanted to I really wish I had been able to take a class just on the like an entire class just on Japanese films just on Russian films just on Chinese and Hong Kong well maybe have the Japanese Chinese Hong Kong all of the Asian films kind of combined into one class I just really wish I had the chance to study these films a lot more especially just not have a week or two on one film because even like languages are different in different countries filmmaking is a totally different language in different countries it is pretty standard all across the board for most techniques but there are some things that some countries do that are very different than things that we do in our country especially in the beginning of cinema filmmaking now everyone does kind of the same thing it's a little bit what I talked about in Tootsie last week where that was a lot of the beginning of what we consider modern cinema where it's very quick cuts just a bunch of different plot points in different narratives whereas in like the early in the early years of cinema nah this isn't necessarily early this is still early ish but cinemas only been around for maybe almost a hundred and twenty-five years so it's kind of in the middle of it in the 1950s it was still very very much in its infancy trying to figure out what techniques you wanted to use and filmmaking was very different in all different parts of the world so like in the very early 1900s where the Soviet montage began what we now know as a general montage sequence it really became popularized during at the film battleship potemkin it was one of the earliest known uses of the Soviet montage where you cut Clips together to kind of form a sequence and different techniques from different parts of the world combined together to form what we now know as cinema but back then cinema was its own language in each country I feel like I kind of went on a little bit of a tangent there to get to my point but this movie is definitely it definitely has its own language especially because it is from the 1950s so I want to talk a little bit about the V language of Japanese film as portrayed through the Seven Samurai and Akira Kurosawa's works but the most notable way that there is a big difference between American cinema and Japanese cinema is how this giant epic film has been cut together and filmed versus a giant epic in America the best example I can think of in American cinema of an epic that is on this similar scale is Ben Hur which was made in 1959 a couple years after the Seven Samurai which was made in 1954 the pacing and the storytelling in Seven Samurai is vastly different than Ben Hur it does take a little bit to get to the big epic part in Seven Samurai but the epic lead-up in Seven Samurai is told through piece of the story that you need to know to get to know the characters and to get to know why everyone feels the way they do at the end of the film and the end of the most epic climax of the movie [Music] whereas from what I remember I've been her it is kind of slow going I don't think I've seen all up in her all the way through I believe it is when I still need to check off the list but from what I remember I've been her it's just it's kind of slow it's a little bit and there's big epic moments spaced throughout the film there are some epic moments in this but it's not to the great scale because with American cinema everything is huge it's always been really big really extravagant and in Japanese culture especially because this one is focusing on a very small village where they can't afford much and it's not supposed to be some big budget movie it was I feel like it from the way it was shot it feels very guerilla style filmmaking and focusing a little bit more on the intimate details of getting to know all of the southern Samurai all of the villagers and going along with their journey of learning how to fight the bandits that are coming towards them their culture of the village and what they are suffering through with very little food tending to their crops and making sure that they have enough food to give this samurai have enough food for themselves and can still protect themselves from the bandits that are coming [Music] and because this is such an epic movie it is very long it is three and a half hours long it is so long that ended up having to watch it in two parts which was very strange for me I usually try to watch these on when sitting so I can keep my notes in a very orderly fashion but it was just so long I ended up having to stop it which I think kind of aided in me being a little bit confused and not really understanding some of this it was very hard to follow the points but there was a quote from 1955 from The Sunday Times that I thought really kind of gave me a little bit comfort in not being able to follow it that says Seven Samurai is long it is brutal it is not always easy to follow but it is magnificent which I completely agree with in so many ways like I've said before it is a huge epic story of just massive epic proportions but there are so many characters and when I say it's not easy to follow that is the reason why there are so many different characters and it's kind of hard to tell them all apart and even though it is told in Japanese and everything the like spoken language is in Japanese you get subtitles but I could still follow the story pretty much without the subtitles it is that it is why I love the show don't tell reason is for foreign films if I can understand what is going on without understanding the language and without meeting subtitles I think that is a great film I wish I could watch some of these American movies and be like do I understand what's going on are they do I understand what's going on if I don't know the language can I understand what's going on if I don't have subtitles and I don't know exactly what's happening and half the time I don't understand what's happening unless I know the source material like if it is a Harry Potter movie or if it's like something that I have watched a million times and kind of know what's going on so there's some movies I'm just like I don't know what's going on can you please stop telling me what's going on and just show me and this movie does that so well there are times when if I choose to I could have walked away and come back a couple of seconds later and still understood what's going on just from what is happening on screen I absolutely love that but I just so many characters to keep track of that even a movie said I understand what's going on I can still kind of get a little bit lost with all the characters that happens with a movie that I absolutely love so much actually a series Lord of the Rings I love that series and I know pretty much all of the three movies by heart but I still get kind of lost with all the different characters especially the ones that have very similar sounding names it's just that's just when my brain works there's just too many characters but it's still Seven Samurai it is so amazing and the last thing I wanted to talk about is the way Akira Kurosawa does the cinematography I remember when we talked about Japanese filmmaking in my class we talked a little bit about a director who didn't necessarily stick to the 180 degree rule if you don't know what that is it is basically where you have a line that goes on this axis the camera goes on this one axis and it can't go beyond it it can go around it but it can't go beyond it otherwise you lose your spatial recognition of what has happening in this scene you just you kind of don't know where you are it little it sets your mind off edge a little bit but it's not something everybody notices right off the bat it's it's something that I still have to watch for if I really am watching for it I'll notice it but sometimes all just notice it because there's something feels a little bit off and I feel like we shouldn't be on this side we weren't here before we go somewhere else it's a little bit weird but I don't think Akira Kurosawa is exactly that director I don't remember exactly who that was but he does play with the 180 degree rule in this and at least one scene this is an example of that scene [Music] sis you're sorry all our clothes not dummy one of cocoa to table okay doctor it's kinda much ducting II know Petra came to the game today what's up with jelly nobody know and there's one scene in this film I absolutely adore the way it was framed at the very end of it it is when one of the villagers Monza finds his daughter she know he cut off all her hair before the samurai came because he was afraid that she would be raped or taken in by one of the samurai and a way that would dishonor her but he finds her with you in two samurai the two of them walking out of the hut together and he gets really upset with Shino he beats her and he berate her calls her a [ __ ] says that she has disgraced herself and kind of just dirtied herself for her future husband once the lead samurai who I there's so many characters in this I can't even remember his name I couldn't pronounce it either even if I tried he comes in and kind of mediates what it's happening and Matos soon comes to realize that his daughter is actually in love with this samurai apprentice and that they look on his face is so sad and then this shot where you just you see she no crying in the background and the look of just pure sadness and terror of on Manzo's face of what he realizes he it's done it's just so heartbreaking and beautiful and the last two things I want to talk about with cinematography do have to do a little bit more editing but it also is kind of the way it was shot as well with the first thing being the way Kurosawa plays with slow motion or regular motion or even sped up a little bit he uses these different speeds of filming to emphasize important parts of the film similarly to the way Scorsese later uses slow motion to emphasize very important decisions or turning points within the main character's life I know there are women like my best friends who would have gotten out of there the minute their boyfriend gave them a gun to hide and finally the way Kurosawa builds tension is amazing he builds attention using cuts and close-ups and holding on specific shots where you see the main focus of that scene his reaction to what is happening that you don't necessarily see until you finally see what is happening it kind of builds the tension up a little bit more so you were anxious to see what the focus of this shot is seeing [Music] the clip I twist for this and they were so many amazing clips to choose from was one that I thought was such a great character moment in like probably the best character moment in the entire film it is a scene where in my opinion Cuchillo goes from pretending to be a samurai to actually being one by standing up to his now peers [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] indefinitely have for the Seven Samurai as always these are just my opinions I would love to know yours any comments down below let me know your favorite samurai film or even your favorite foreign language film if in always films I have
