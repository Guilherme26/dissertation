D for disgusting teenagers this movie is garbage from a mom's perspective this coming-of-age movie,0.88394177
is just trash every single Gen Z teenager featured in this film lives in the,0.57017994
gutter seriously I mean I know I'm a mom right so this is my perspective,0.18101881
but other than wanting to get into a good college none of these teenagers seem,0.19555263
to have any moral or good behavior at all their language is filthy they do,0.6064755
drugs they engage in underage drinking they're disrespectful to adults and to each other they,0.38776842
trash talk everything and everybody and are constantly looking to hook up with someone that's,0.4740216
not not my idea of a fun insightful comedy even of teenagers today so beautiful,0.17270617
Olivia Wilde has her directorial debut and she gives us a wild movie indeed she,0.25416896
said that some of the teen flicks from the 80s and 90s were her inspirations,0.1239845
such as The Breakfast Club Fast Times at Ridgemont High and clueless and I guess,0.11797972
she just decided to turn these carefree movies into rated R garbage this movie actually,0.6364068
would make me really worried for the future if I thought every teenager was like,0.11282118
this except that I know many good teens who are not like the type of,0.1540775
teens that are represented in this movie and it frustrated me because they didn't even,0.15018481
have like in movies like this they'll often have like the token Christian goodie two-shoe,0.27237365
kids that everybody makes fun of who was such a dork right they didn't even,0.8060606
offer that it just made it seem like every teenager sleeping around and doing all,0.17749205
of these horrible things and that they're just jerks like I didn't really like any,0.8606264
of the character well there were there were a couple that I liked but even,0.04250021
still it just seemed to me to paint a very sideways picture of teenagers today,0.07382491
I just think that there's so much better than what this movie portrayed so some,0.11400231
tips for parents first of all it's rated R there are no role models in,0.09591984
this movie even the teachers at the school are not necessarily good role models because,0.07700188
they sleep with their students and they drink and they swear and they're disrespectful and,0.44427666
you know and I'm like give me at least a good teacher even nothing in,0.24318905
this movie and I recognize it's comedy or it's supposed to be a comedy but,0.121653974
come on anyway back to the tips for parents so there's lots of profanity crude,0.15762265
language and so many f-bombs now I know teenagers drop f-bombs like crazy but you,0.7035153
know it I don't know I just I don't need to hear it and I,0.08859884
know a lot of teenagers who don't use language like that so again it just,0.13551405
seemed very stilted anyway we never see Molly's parents in the movie ever Amy's parents,0.09622396
appear a couple of times but they're so afraid of parenting her that she basically,0.13572812
does anything that she wants with no discipline no restrictions no consequences for her behavior,0.11552863
and the parents are trying so hard to be cool and hip and liked that,0.07184949
they're not parenting and so again no good parenting role models either I mean they're,0.09608491
nice and I like both of the actors but just terrible role models there are,0.16563167
a couple of gay guys there are some lesbians who actually go at it in,0.6861749
the bathroom at a party there's talk of other things that people do there's lots,0.096735455
of premarital sex Hege pinky talk of masturbation all that kind of stuff it's just,0.8606264
super awkward there's drugs and alcohol to girls watch porn so funny right I just,0.7295759
think that's so stupid a bunch of teens swim in their underwear at a party,0.8785311
nobody seems to bat and I even these like shy kids are just like ripping,0.5891539
off their clothes okay you could not never have paid me money to do that,0.18309592
as a teenager now social justice warriors will think that this movie is bold and,0.15266246
brilliant because everybody is trying to be so politically correct to give equal time to,0.10508827
everybody which is great but you can do it in a better way I think,0.11609677
anyway and this is yet one more movie about female empowerment and it it shows,0.21674265
just that men are dismissed as useless or sexual objects there's no good strong male,0.8132063
role models either I do like the dad he's very sweet he tries to communicate,0.12530994
which is great but again he's also a little afraid of his daughter in that,0.15033701
regard the bad behavior is portrayed just as though everybody does it and nobody bats,0.11353569
an eye nobody thinks it's wrong even the premise of the movies that Molly and,0.11411907
Amy worked hard all throughout their high school years to get into a good college,0.10910152
with their good grades but then they learn that they could have partied all those,0.041422196
years like everybody else at the high school and that would have been a better,0.04926944
use of their time so now they're trying to make up for lost time and,0.09964698
it's just ridiculous not everybody parties in high school either and not every party has,0.5876557
to be filled with alcohol and drugs and sex I am just saying there's also,0.6045348
a scene where guys and girls are all in one bathroom at a high school,0.24722207
and I'm I'm thinking is that a thing at high school now I mean the,0.08193777
unisex bathroom thing I don't know I used to teach at high school and we,0.13382119
didn't have that so I don't know what's going on some themes positive themes are,0.06735457
I really like the very beginning of the movie because Molly wakes up and she,0.10429417
hears these recordings that are these positive affirmations and so one is greatness takes sacrifice,0.15360008
and so that's her mantra really throughout high school is that she's sacrificing her young,0.24523173
free-wheeling days and she's putting her nose to the grindstone and she's studying hard so,0.28479728
that she can get into a good college right so she hears that kind of,0.19173752
talk at the beginning of her day and she's committed to it that's impressive behavior,0.08510481
actually and then certainly friendship between these two girls and some other people although they,0.1127428
they're kind of I mean they're very very tight and almost exclusive while they are,0.1179081
exclusive to other people they yeah they want to around but nobody can really crack,0.18864916
that deep friendship that they have it I think that's great to have a best,0.071704485
friend but I think friendships should allow more people into their circle in that sense,0.21762267
that you know everybody needs to feel loved and wanted anyway some things that I,0.073542245
did like our beanie Feldstein and Katelyn Deaver they're the two teenage girls and they,0.11478365
both really did a fantastic job I think beanie did she was just the highlight,0.10295247
of all of the scenes when she was on scene Katelyn was a little bit,0.14557682
more shy and subdued although she's the lesbian wanting to have sex with various girls,0.8484577
but anyway they did a good job with the material I laughed when Molly corrected,0.088348396
the grammar on the bathroom graffiti I've never done that but I've always wanted to,0.07714873
you because I'm a little bit of a grammar nazi so I thought that was,0.5906451
kind of funny and then the adults in the movie include comedians and funny man,0.18215728
Jason Sudeikis Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte there's a reference to Malala in the movie,0.067388654
in fact it's a code word that the two girls use and they think it's,0.15285844
really clever and everyone should see that the movie he named me Malala and be,0.17813917
inspired or at least read the book and so I loved that there was some,0.08107525
intelligence behind and some thought mind that the code word that the girls had with,0.15958913
each other however so much of the rest of the humor was not intelligent or,0.47197136
clever humor and I thought with a name like brain smart I'd be book smart,0.34896308
that they should have been a little smarter especially in their choices anyway I liked,0.17817514
watching everyone get a water balloon in the face during the closing credits I thought,0.09960185
that was a cute way to have the closing credits play and it if it,0.077195354
weren't for the constant flood of f-bombs which were just so annoying I mean I,0.53490317
get one every now and then for emphasis but it's just a constant onslaught some,0.06263788
of the dialogue is actually amusing and even quotable - all the profanity that's in,0.1500584
almost every sentence in the movie so annoying and producer Dan the Automator composed the,0.21513458
score for this music and they thought that they they did a really good job,0.07234673
matching the lyrics for the moment just to kind of illustrate it and emphasize what,0.069023825
was happening either to these two girls in particular or other characters so I did,0.094131336
thought I did think that that was good some other things that I didn't like,0.06902985
is that like I said it's just not that funny and it seemed like this,0.13439167
script was written more for shock value more for than for actual clever humor and,0.15285514
Billie lourd who plays Gigi is just her characters just a total psycho who's really,0.5876557
more pathetic than funny and you know I I just anyway she says bug me,0.8223519
I mean she did a good job with the role but she also looked like,0.071759984
she was in her 20s and not a high school in fact almost all of,0.23815227
the teenagers look like it had been maybe years since they were in high school,0.10362474
some of the teachers that we meet at the high school have potty mouths and,0.40449813
they act done professionally I mentioned that before and you know one movie that I,0.06275854
thought that had a better cast because they looked younger is the movie eighth grade,0.12939559
it's also filled with a lot of profanity and some of the things that I,0.15848786
didn't really like but if you're if you like this movie I think that you'll,0.15075302
really like that movie and I thought that that one was actually well better done,0.06871225
but still good for Olivia Wilde for going from being beautiful actress to now directing,0.18601604
a movie so kudos to her alright that's it for today be sure to hit,0.21742927
the subscribe button and thanks for visiting the site I love it when you guys,0.0793674
