as someone who said his fair share of Moving's mentality difficulties and ethnic clashes in,0.23869944
the family I very strongly believe that the complexity of multicultural families is a very,0.06910514
difficult thing to tackle in any audio-visual form let alone a one and a half,0.09204316
hour feature of course I can't possibly speak for any expat family but mine and,0.08869113
I most definitely cannot compare my frankly very privileged position to the experience of chinese-american,0.3503949
families yet somehow Loula Wong's The Farewell manages to capture that unique charm of being,0.03630305
stuck inside your own strangely cosmopolitan identity although while unfolding a universally congenial story that,0.14504474
is both profoundly sad and endearingly hilarious the film is a true account of Wong's,0.08927342
experiences with her family and follows her or Billie as she's called in the script,0.07622179
after she receives the news that her grandmother 9'i has been diagnosed with terminal lung,0.16741239
cancer and has only three months left to live ironically that isn't even the most,0.1883884
tragic fact due to Chinese tradition cancer patients don't always receive the news from hospitals,0.27573228
or their families and are left in the dark up until their very death so,0.447878
using her cousin's fake wedding as a ploy to visit the grandmother Billie and her,0.35215646
parents traveled to China to bid nine a farewell let me just say this right,0.056328926
off the bat the farewell is a remarkable work for a multitude of reasons but,0.088147245
one that has to be mentioned at the forefront of this review is that Lula,0.07460768
Wang managed to direct this entirely personal incredibly heartfelt film well the fully chinese-american cast,0.1423296
and around 80% of the dialogue being in Mandarin for a crowd-pleasing PG rated film,0.08621613
like this and hopefully 8:24 give it a decently sized domestic release this truly is,0.08109805
a breakthrough in indie cinema of course we had crazy rich Asians last year but,0.6252737
that film had the backing of Warner Brothers and a somewhat established book fan base,0.031451996
so the quality of that comparison is zero to none if you're watching this video,0.14910127
when the farewell is already out in your country please show your support it's an,0.12838197
extraordinary film okay and now that I'm done with publicity let's talk about why the,0.16190843
farewells bleak subject matter is soba Musa Lee delightful in the context of our grim,0.10726631
everyday reality at the heart of it we have a timeless elegy that's rats in,0.3922091
this darkly comedic package of cultural traditions identity confusion and moving authenticity the farewell walks,0.06518892
on that thin line between comedy and tragedy there is a scene here is during,0.10307639
which a congratulatory speech turns it to what essentially is a eulogy a person breaks,0.08186602
down crying the camera slowly pans out to reveal the confused audience and the only,0.13136688
thing left for us the viewers is to laugh while trying to suppress that overwhelming,0.11416905
sense of sorrow the genuineness of the constructed narrative and the way she presents it,0.059164796
is what truly makes Lulu Wong suffer more efforts stand out she mentioned during the,0.09377525
Q&A that she was slightly inspired by the works of Roy Anderson and Ruben Auslan,0.04953857
but honestly I would argue that in the melancholic satirical works of those directors there,0.25862297
is always a conspicuous sense of detachment which is a stark contrast with Wong's direct,0.10628591
openness with a viewer she's ready to be vulnerable in front of the audience while,0.11327054
sharing a chapter in her book of life and I think that's a rare occurrence,0.16599636
in modern non documentary cinema in a way it kind of reminded me of the,0.053608306
light sanyas Varda and her approach to storytelling so effortlessly assured yet delicate and wise,0.0755693
and the fellows about tight-knit relatives and family values it's always crucial for the entire,0.07388119
production to be as invested in the script as your writers and your directors because,0.11984706
otherwise the work would just lose his distinctive sense of identity and that is usually,0.102548875
what the films of that kind of subject matter go for thankfully that is not,0.11195119
the case for the farewell because the end sum will cast and the crew pulled,0.0540393
off something miraculous here and I mean truly truly remarkable you not only believe this,0.094637014
seemingly preposterous for the Western society story but you also feel through every emotion that,0.14530505
the character Billy played by Aquafina ghost - it's a vividly spiritual experience that not,0.08585148
only says a lot about one's relationship with their family but also with themselves and,0.053801928
it is truly enhanced by awkwafina's remarkably tender performance she goes through so many emotional,0.09575977
states throughout the film it's very impressive to see what she did here it was,0.055234123
surprising to see her tackle such an emotionally challenging but she proves to be much,0.24632768
more than just the quirky character that Hollywood try to pitch her ass admittedly she,0.8899001
does have great comedic timing but she also has a very impressive dramatic range that,0.055804405
I hope to see more of in the coming years Lulu long mentioned that the,0.077263
casting process was a very important aspect of her film and that she fought many,0.088913225
many years with many producers who did not want to fund a fully Asian cast,0.13820127
feature clearly after seeing the film I cannot possibly imagine a different outcome I think,0.07240377
that when I was watching the film it almost felt like every single character and,0.026632676
the actor blended in together it feels like they lived through their respective roles and,0.06734444
I think one of them actually did the nice sister in the film was played,0.049364194
by Wong's great on so it is the family feature really in every sense of,0.055267207
the word ones attention to detail is also evidence in the film's visual and musical,0.016104786
choices grays and blues dominate the film's color palette reflecting the characters emotional states occasionally,0.009190978
breaking into the hopeful orange and greens during the dream sequences that roaring borderline amusing,0.104312405
sadness is further intensified by Alex Weston's outstanding score that only amplifies the mournful ambience,0.13706231
of a wedding bouquet and the perplexing laughter that follows it's a scrupulously detailed film,0.1300366
that makes me wonder how come this is just one second feature a less skilled,0.1279603
director would have definitely gone for more flatulent pathos or emotional manipulation or maybe even,0.34594247
visual exuberance yet what Wang achieves here is so muted yet so effective and the,0.08642563
emotional qualities of the film reach their Apogee only at the very very end of,0.112377465
the film with a beautiful final shot now I know that I can be entirely,0.24817848
objective in the case of this film the portrayal of a character struggling with cultural,0.05614991
identity and belonging is something that hits very close to home I come from a,0.08108264
multicultural family my family members are scattered all across the world and right now I,0.24255651
live in the UK a country where I have no relatives whatsoever so the question,0.18845923
where is my home arises practically on a daily basis yet underneath all of that,0.094804004
