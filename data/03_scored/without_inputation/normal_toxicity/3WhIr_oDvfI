you the good and I got to give you the back ok 3d you gotta,0.1802948
stop I'm sorry this was my limit I'm cool with IMAX I'm cool with big,0.15484942
screen but the 3d gimmick has got to go this movie is going so good,0.07772226
I've enjoying myself and then there's just one little mask or one little guy running,0.24108355
across or one little guitar just something that just just shooting directly at the screen,0.45385447
and I don't watch it in 3d but I knew oh this is for the,0.0833035
3d screen stop doing that it just takes you out of a movie when things,0.20443074
do that make a 3d gimmicky complete film or just make a film in a,0.08156306
3d environment I'm so sick of seeing scenes in movies where I know they are,0.16289826
deliberately there just so they can have that 3d effect so they can say hey,0.05792684
let's make people pay $3 more for 3d if you don't need it don't do,0.104803905
it it doesn't know if it's a sequel or a reboot and I think it,0.13462949
would have helped to decide they explained generically who max is in the beginning you're,0.052884515
gonna be able to follow it even if you know nothing about the Mad Max,0.1911114
franchise it's a whole new story but yes there aren't time that's kind of referencing,0.052400343
something that happened in earlier Mad Max films but you don't really get too much,0.14975584
detail to it the biggest part of that are these flashbacks there's time when Max,0.06170277
has these just weird flashbacks where something happened in the past you can leave it,0.1271448
to interpretation if you've seen some of those earlier films you might have a better,0.10929637
understanding of what that's trying to reference so I think if they would have just,0.059135657
decided it was a sequel decided was a reboot and just gave some kind of,0.0616962
context to some of those things that would just made it absolutely perfect for the,0.051792033
nerdy immortal Joe the main bad guy in this film is played by the same,0.494794
actor who played toecutter the main bad guy in the very first Mad Max bill,0.5154597
