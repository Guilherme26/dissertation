it's a new spike Lee joint man,0.18174925
and the best spike Lee joint I've seen in a long time probably the best spike Lee joint since the inside man but the inside man didn't really feel like a spike Lee joint but it was inspired to be joint but it didn't it didn't fall into the spike Lee joint mold,0.07728387
this is right up Spike Lee's alley right here the subject matter the tone this is right up his alley,0.07781186
it was good to see him back back in form,0.15661603
and you don't there and shout out his documentary,0.3174116
he's done some great documentaries,0.1022652
but like a movie with the with the attention of the people in his style of director,0.11667022
it's good to see him back man,0.15518725
anyway the story's about it's based on a true story which I didn't know about until the movie came out about a black cop who infiltrated the KKK,0.47671613
I was like what a Colorado Springs police officer infiltrated the KKK via telephone conversations then he had another cop go in that poses him infiltrated the KKK,0.24476244

I thought they made,0.0493688
it up for for a film,0.08840865
you know,0.07163658
I thought,0.039424464
it was just a Chappelle's Show sketch and then they expanded it on that but no life is stranger than fiction man,0.15625703
I was like wow that's pretty dope the movie stars John David Washington and you got Alec Baldwin in there you got Topher Gracie you have Adam driver and the girl from spider-man homecoming because I was trying to figure out the whole time because she had an afro,0.31089434
I was like this girl looks so familiar I was looking at the whole town I can't wait to get on IMDB when this movie is over,0.20324008
that's what I love about IMDB you,0.15247132
can just go straight to,0.11310568
there's no back,0.055139635
in the day,0.04837732
I grew up in the 80s there was no IMDB you had to really be like,0.085397564
I know that face from somewhere,0.16805072
but you don't even know the name so even even when the cast rolls at the end you don't even know who you're looking for we love crap,0.794439
I see the name,0.033040695
but there's nothing what else were they in,0.06252134
but now I am DB highlight Paul Walter Hauser who played in the he played an eye tiniest shine Eckhart he played in that movie man he killed me in Italian,0.46643612
he killed me again in this man the way he plays his characters is hilarious and this movie man there's a lot of funny stuff in this movie it's not like a it's not like a you know serious are we gonna be serious and stressed and pissed off the whole movie it's like a lot of moments of comedy in this movie and a lot of hard-hitting moments too and like you know you really just take it in and it's just cool the see and like these characters the characters they create it,0.40335405
they felt really like lived in and creeping like you find yourself like even the KKK members you find yourself like this guy right here is not that bad even though he's in the KKK I could deal with him,0.44035903
right,0.04255815
here this guy's just no but this guy kind of cool laid-back kind of like his attitude even though he hates,0.51899517
people like me did bad if a guy that's when you know you've created like good characters like when you could still find a nugget of humanity in there and like you know,0.38946232
there was a wife of one of the KKK members who did a good job - she was like this happy homemaker type but she was really just racist as hell but it was just good to see but had the sweetest face I'm the old guy all this ugliness coming out of this didn't see that,0.55552524
coming but you see it coming because she's married to a die-hard Klansmen seen women to die hard out here man when they believe in something off,0.6364068
man it worse in the men those dynamics were really good in this picture like there was a,0.16648974
moment in the movie where they were like dancing and like a at a party,0.073746584
and you know this is seventies,0.09624006
so the music was right,0.065535344
they had the afro was gone,0.42959687
I found myself smiling at the scene like I want to be there,0.052620362
yeah I told my girlfriend I was like I wanted to be at that party you know this she just looked at me like what don't judge me out here the performance would be good man,0.1619376
it was just a good flow,0.04566325
occasionally I would like drift off and kind of be like where are they going right now like they were there,0.115250885
with definitely moments do the editing and like you know those type of choices where I was just like where we're going,0.0449253
now okay all right,0.059612017
that's cool that's cool,0.05293697
why we why do we go there this way spike all right,0.15473317
so I definitely had moments of that this movie is not flawless but it was a good watch and the last the final ending moments in the movie were very powerful,0.069519244
I'm not gonna say,0.1520847
what happened,0.05228998
I'm not gonna tell you just gonna have to see it for yourself,0.18329903
what did it was just silent,0.071484014
it was very powerful man,0.0764498
my girl was like I almost folded that was like this this movie is right on time,0.19447441
this is the one-year anniversary you know the stuff that went on in Virginia with the tiki torches neither I say anymore,0.0824671
and so it's very timely,0.06910809
this is very on the button issues,0.10615345
so it really resonates,0.045044746
and that's one of the takeaways man,0.15414093
the timeliness of it another takeaway is man Denzel Sun,0.19938275
he has the future man like you know,0.1304408
he plays on the HBO series ballers and like this is the first time I seen him in the film I probably seen him in other films didn't even know it was him,0.06163604
and he has a future man is just like his pops,0.124281324
he did a good job,0.08336181
I was listening to see if he sounded like Denzel if he moved like I thought I heard pockets was like yo,0.15802357
he sounded like busy right there but I don't know if I'm overlooking like says I know who his dad is I'm like oh that was it is it,0.15013622
I think I heard a little bit in it,0.064173356
but if I didn't know who he was what I had heard then zero probably not probably not he's his old man,0.19175386
I'm saying but I was definitely looking and listening definitely doing that this is easily,0.036693156
the best Spike Lee movie in a long time does it live up to the hype,0.08548131
it's a good movie it's a good movie is the great table's great I say it's good though very timely but you know it didn't it didn't blow my socks off,0.14191301
it didn't make my team shatter but it is definitely definitely better than chiraq chiraq that spike Lee joint right there pissed me off,0.29474762
it's not just because I'm from Chicago but it might be because up from Chicago,0.06467192
I just didn't like how it was done,0.093382925
I was like this is I really didn't like chiraq at all,0.08509404
so this is a big,0.07995959
it's a big improvement,0.069534205
it was Spike Lee's last movie,0.06530536
