gonna get which is awesome sometimes you go into a movie the opening scene is,0.045738026
fabulous and then the whole rest of the movie you're like wait wait but there's,0.03430219
so much action in this opening scene and there's none throughout the rest of the,0.029364532
movie no the the vibe and the hilarity that you get in the beginning scene,0.04485932
of this movie literally translates throughout the entire film and I absolutely loved that thor,0.031939458
ragnarok is the third installment of the thor series and the millionth installment of marvel,0.018181464
movies but I gotta say sometimes you can get to that third movie and it's,0.029812865

if it's my favorite Thor movie because I really loved the second Thor movie but,0.02079098
it definitely is up there Chris Hemsworth as usual is the most incredible Thor he's,0.028334828
hilarious in this film as well as strong and heroic which was really nice and,0.03533655
can get a little boring sometimes when you have a lead hero that's just like,0.035756946
I'm a hero all I do is hero a hero there and a hero there,0.011209009
and a hero everywhere but Thor he is a charming and hilarious hero all right,0.035606615
he's got more to him than just saving the world and I love that about,0.024447495
him now we do have some new characters joining us in this film which I'm,0.045581043
not gonna say names in case it's a spoiler but I will say Tessa Thompson,0.03670084
plays a new character in this movie and she's phenomenal absolutely phenomenal I want her,0.05917873
character to have her own movie now there was a moment in the film where,0.015075057
I saw what her own movie might look like and I was like oh my,0.09116741
gosh can we please make this happen SIF never got a movie in fact whatever,0.14884283
happened to SIF who knows she's not in the film which is a bummer because,0.1352172
I love SIF but we do have Tessa Thompson's character and she's awesome she had,0.020930003
some moments in the film that totally stole the show and she was just she,0.0664126
was just such a cool character I loved I loved her character and I thought,0.020455062
that she worked really well alongside Thor and some of the other characters that you,0.022332875
know I don't want to give away too much but I just got to say,0.033811286
I was so pleasantly surprised because I had no idea I was like oh this,0.024633747
character could either be really cool or she could just not be great and I,0.06514942
really liked her and I want more of her character I would love for her,0.036961593
character to have her own movie especially like an origin story of her character I,0.032057196
think that would just be so amazing if you've seen the trailers which I'm sure,0.03091441
you have because they're everywhere we do have Thor going up against Hulk in like,0.039612353
the ultimate gladiator battle in this film and I have to say it is hilarious,0.04915042
but it's not just hilarious it is action-packed and intense at the same time this,0.03393501
whole movie kind of felt like that they did such a good job keeping the,0.051208496
film funny light-hearted but also didn't lack any action or or drama like they did,0.024853922
such a good job at merging both of those things which is what I love,0.020566149
the most about the film we do get a new villain in Thor Ragnarok Kate,0.039978202
Blanchet plays hella who is our villain and she's awesome I thought Cate Blanchett did,0.15873344
a great job so with the comedy and the humor of this film being one,0.03683521
of my favorite parts I can understand that there are probably gonna be some people,0.02414417
out there that think that there isn't enough drama in this movie and maybe think,0.026899362
that the humor or the comedy overshadows the drama of the film and that's a,0.033601087
very fair opinion okay it wasn't dark and gritty and super dramatic but it was,0.05570913
fun and action-packed I still think it had some drama it just wasn't maybe as,0.03185631
drama heavy as say the first Thor movie but that's what I liked about this,0.03551083
one I do have to say there is one thing in this movie that I,0.035969805
