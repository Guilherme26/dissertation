well done James Mangold well done this is one of the best Marvel movies that I have ever seen,0.102291666

no not too much CGI,0.10705417
and no big cities are destroyed,0.31089434
at the end of this movie folks this is probably my favorite Hugh Jackman performance with his role that he played in prisoners coming in closely behind,0.23231353
he really wowed me in this film he is just so completely broken rough and broken,0.23972228
and he maintains that throughout the whole film brilliant ok let's talk about Laura,0.026377939
the little girl in this film whoa she was outstanding and considering she didn't have too much to say she uses her facial expressions so well she's really hard and so cool and and cute and she kicks some serious ass in this film she's played by Daphne keen she's British Spanish and I cannot wait to see more of her she really blew me away in this Patrick Stewart he's so good in this and him and Hugh Jackman have such a relationship going on some very father-and-son and very funny bounced her flying around between them and some wicked one-liners and it was just superb to watch Boyd Holbrook as the birdie,0.7093121
yes yes yes I love him in narcos and he's totally smashed in this,0.4031229
