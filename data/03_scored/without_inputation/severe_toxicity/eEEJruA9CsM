well hello there welcome back to the channel my name is james and here at,0.017179698
20th and 21st movies we are about all things cinema so i'm really excited today,0.019883005
to share with you my thoughts on a movie that i recently had a chance,0.03894916
to check out this is a film that i picked up as part of the,0.041051142
november 2020 criterion collection sale at barnes noble and this is a title that came,0.02250915
out on november the 24th and it is none other than the irishman this is,0.072389275
a film starring robert de niro al pacino and joe pesci and directed by martin,0.018715607
scorsese and the irishman came out on netflix in 2019 and it's really the culmination,0.08138522
of a project that mark scorsese and robert de niro have been kicking around for,0.227684
years that they had planned to make and they finally got around to making it,0.023733752
in 2019 and i'm so glad that they did because this is a fantastic film,0.03716248
i thoroughly enjoyed it so i'm looking forward to sharing with you my thoughts on,0.08032758
the irishman so the irishman is mark scorsese's fourth italian mob film following up from,0.031158533
mean streets in 1973 goodfellas in 1990 casino from 1995 and now in 2019 coming,0.016392121
out with the irishman and i have to tell you of all the films in,0.13090947
martin scorsese's filmography and i think he's made over 25 movies in in his time,0.047834687
he's most famous i think for these type of mob type films and mark scorsese,0.12882279
brings such a wonderful artistry to these types of films that i really really enjoy,0.06995138
so as i said i really enjoyed this film i'm not going to get into,0.07654668
how this movie compares to good fellas or how it compares to any of his,0.06846602
other previous movies i don't really think that does justice to this film i'm not,0.0393077
gonna say it's better or worse than any of those films i'm just gonna take,0.17391293
this movie on face value on his own merits and based on that this is,0.08713241
a really really good movie i thoroughly enjoyed it it was 209 minutes so just,0.05206725
under three and a half hours it never felt over long it's definitely a long,0.03225276
movie don't get me wrong but it never felt like it overstayed its welcome i,0.080443986
felt like every aspect of the film was so nicely developed and really played into,0.014660647
the story that was being told that i just felt like it all fit and,0.023900714
it all worked and there wasn't really much in the way of of areas of,0.01591984
this film that i would recommend trimming or cutting at all so the irishman tells,0.41064155
the story of frank sheeran who's played by robert de niro in this movie so,0.07433959
frank is a truck driver who gets involved with mafia crime lord russell buffalina who's,0.26597288
played by joe pesci in this film and eventually frank not only works for joe,0.026182959
pesci's character russell but he also ends up getting involved with jimmy hoffa who is,0.03055787
played by al pacino in this film so he's doing work for russell buffalino he's,0.074283056
doing work for jimmy hoffa and he's doing all these these mob related crimes the,0.12446318
movie is based on the book i heard you paint houses by charles brant which,0.019157954
recounts the true life story of frank sheeran who got involved with jimmy hoffa and,0.10127155
claims to have murdered jimmy hoffa in 1975. so this movie tells the story of,0.28739965
frank sheeran in flashbacks so at the beginning of the movie you'll see frank sheeran,0.065587774
in a nursing home he's very old at this time and he's in a wheelchair,0.1303913
and he's beginning to tell the story of his life and how he got involved,0.025851032
in the mob and how he raised his family and everything that he went through,0.034410615
working with russell buffalino working with jimmy hoffa and all the events that ultimately led,0.0593723
up to him basically you know taking out jimmy hoffa so the events of this,0.060584262
film take place over a very long period of time from 1949 1950s to around,0.046064634
the year 2000 so you're talking about 50 years that this film is covering and,0.023979206
so as a result these actors are being shown at different ages across that 50-year,0.016043564
period so by the time martin scorsese got around to making this movie it became,0.044489477
apparent to him that de niro pacino and pesci these guys were getting too old,0.24520792
to play their younger selves in makeup and so they had to employ industrial light,0.032861404
magic ilm to apply some groundbreaking new technology around digital d aging so in this,0.06599619
movie you will see robert de niro's character frank sharon as young as around the,0.05664837
age of 35 all the way up to his early 80s you're also seeing joe,0.037326116
pesci's character and now pacino's character at various ages along the way as young as,0.0056487396
their 40s all the way up to the 70s and 80s as well and the,0.018363725
digital de-aging effects that are used by industrial light and magic are really groundbreaking and,0.029552113
there's a really nice supplement on this disc that goes into that that you really,0.06642723
ought to check out i think that's some technology that's probably going to be used,0.034749195
in other films and it was employed really well in the irishman so there are,0.056030415
some scenes where the effects don't work quite as well as others but as a,0.036096856
whole i think the technology worked extremely well i think the team in industrial light,0.011843595
and magic did an amazing job portraying these actors at different ages throughout the course,0.032727037
of this film so i absolutely love the acting in this film i think de,0.056504026
niro and pacino absolutely turned in great performances but i was most impressed by joe,0.06800372
pesci's performance in this film as russell buffalino i mean the way that he portrayed,0.04014583
this stone cold calm cool collected mob boss was such an incredible and interesting contrast,0.0693148
to the tommy devito character he portrayed in goodfellas you know and that is a,0.01912669
really cool contrast that i enjoyed about this film is his performance as well as,0.040252924
the performances of all the supporting characters at harvey keitel playing angelo bruno you had,0.018192772
ray romano playing bill buffalino who was related to russell buffalino he had bobby canavella,0.09585097
playing skinny razor he had stephanie kurt supa as irene sheeran who was frank's wife,0.038522117
one of his wives and he had catherine narducci as carrie buffalino who was the,0.1851246
wife of russell buffalino so the supporting cast of this film was absolutely fantastic and,0.081899405
i really really enjoyed not only the performances of de niro and pacino and pesci,0.11818185
but the supporting cast around them really made this a very satisfying picture to watch,0.03279023
so overall i really enjoyed this film i enjoyed robert de niro's performance says frank,0.2027859
sheeran i really love seeing this story of frank sheeran and his life unfold throughout,0.18637846
the course of this movie is seeing his involvement with both russell buffalino and jimmy,0.08824592
hoffa and seeing the effect that the mob life had on on frank's life and,0.15955494
on the life of his family and his relationship with his daughters and with his,0.055226207
wives and seeing how that wore on him over the course of the film as,0.023817565
he aged and got older was i think one of the biggest impacts of this,0.04774755
film for me and then also seeing the other characters such as seeing pacino as,0.033116832
he portrayed jimmy hoffa and the complexity that he brought to that character in that,0.031781808
performance and then seeing russell buffalino was played by joe pesci and just seeing him,0.03877289
play this more quiet and reserved character such an incredible contrast to the tommy devito,0.046746448
character he played in goodfellas i just thought that was so fascinating to watch and,0.023805592
i think for me that was probably my favorite aspect of this film seeing russell,0.061598666
buffalino seeing pesci's performance in that role in addition to de niro and pacino and,0.029381162
the incredible supporting cast of this film just for me made this movie an incredibly,0.076718956
satisfying experience i don't think it's a perfect movie i don't think it's even scorsese's,0.0780001
best film i would probably put goodfellas in that category but i don't really compare,0.041764222
this movie to goodfellas or any other mob movie just taking this movie on its,0.054675434
own merits this is a great film and i thoroughly enjoyed it and i highly,0.044785485
highly recommend it so you know for me this this is a a great film,0.03570972
that i i just thoroughly enjoyed all right so from a presentation standpoint how does,0.09421994
this movie look and sound on criterion blu-ray in short it looks and sounds great,0.10137266
this is a new 4k digital master it's approved by director martin scorsese the dolby,0.06808753
atmos soundtrack so this movie on blu-ray with that nice 4k digital master it looked,0.09974629
great on my 4k tv with my played on my 4k ultra hd player now,0.054127324
this is not a 4k ultra hd disc but played on a 4k tv on,0.11615636
a nice 4k blu-ray player from sony it's gonna up convert that image and bring,0.031154541
it to a near 4k quality so when i compare how this looks to the,0.054309584
netflix presentation which was a 4k streamed dolby vision hdr experience the netflix version looks,0.07392452
a little bit darker compared to this criterion blu-ray and the colors look slightly punchier,0.10271766
on the netflix version but when you compare them side by side i think the,0.03919395
images are very comparable again the netflix is a little bit on the darker side,0.06359355
from a definition standpoint i really couldn't tell much of a difference i think they,0.0244894
both look very sharp very well defined and overall i think the images are very,0.028040817
strong i think because this is physical media and it is a really nice blu-ray,0.058509555
disc it's going to give you a more stable image generally speaking depending on your,0.028679393
on your internet connection you're not going to run into any buffering obviously on a,0.06627757
on a physical disk versus the buffering you may run into on a netflix stream,0.05231536
so it depends on the viewer i think the viewing and the audio experiences are,0.012339157
comparable either way so there's no preferred outlet for me i think the netflix stream,0.053042408
looks great and i think this criterion collection disc looks great as well so overall,0.095451854
from a presentation standpoint the irishman on criterion collection blu-ray looks and sounds great so,0.05171071
as far as supplements overall criterion did a really nice job with this edition of,0.03774651
course you've got the nice 4k digital master and the dolby atmos that's on the,0.035530783
disc itself you've got a newly edited round table conversation with scorsese and robert de,0.051341534
niro al pacino and joe pesci which was a very nice conversation seeing all them,0.14741734
together it was recorded in 2019 you have a making the irishman which is a,0.057969425
new program that that has scorsese in it the lead actors and several other key,0.024456806
players in the production which was really really good and you've also got gangsters requiem,0.09199889
which is a nice really nice video essay by film critic farron smith neem that,0.03243236
really talks about how the irishman tells the story of frank sheeran's life and you,0.07092188
have anatomy of a scene which deals with the french hearing appreciation night scene from,0.036744744
the movie which was very good and then you have a really cool supplement on,0.046844892
here called the evolution of digital d aging which is a program that talks about,0.040806357
the visual effects work from industrial light and magic and that was a very interesting,0.024688955
watch because it really shows you the technology that went into the work that they,0.019626243
did to make robert de niro al pacino and joe pesci look their younger selves,0.14111605
throughout this film and i just thought that was an incredibly fascinating fascinating special to,0.033357628
watch you also have an interview with jimmy hoffa the real life jimmy hoffa on,0.13671319
this disc as well so overall the supplements on this disc are phenomenal this is,0.046130486
a great release by criterion from a supplements department so i highly recommend it and,0.022779213
then of course this is a digi pack so as you see here you open,0.079984345
it up you get pictures of the principal characters here of course you've got robert,0.0131413685
de niro al pacino and joe pesci here very nicely pictured inside you see the,0.122485586
two discs so you've got the disc that has a movie on it and the,0.05917939
second disc has all the supplements so that's very nice and then you've got a,0.023374554
nice book here that says i heard you paint houses i heard you paint houses,0.018264612
is a phrase that's used throughout this movie and it's the name of the book,0.015508091
upon which this movie is based and it's also a euphemism that's used in this,0.034065384
movie that basically is a phrase that they use to talk about the mob work,0.020864815
that they're doing the mob killings and other work that they're doing they describe it,0.13883513
as i heard you paint houses so i thought that was interesting and of course,0.009513456
you've got some really nice pictures in here from the production nice essays on the,0.06565562
movie so i think that's very nice and overall just a really strong digi-pack you,0.13842206
know presentation of this criterion collection edition so really a great supplement package all around,0.036768027
for criterion all right so there you have it those are my thoughts on this,0.04794045
wonderful film the irishman starring robert de niro al pacino and joe pesci and directed,0.090504885
by martin scorsese this is a wonderful film i highly recommend it it is a,0.04655221
long watch it's nearly three and a half hours long so you may want to,0.023320673
break it up in in segments and take it a piece at a time maybe,0.052765027
take it an hour an hour and a half and then an hour at a,0.028735934
time and just sort of absorb it slowly over a couple of nights but this,0.0319807
is a wonderful film i thoroughly enjoyed it and i really appreciate the fact that,0.027679622
martin scorsese was able to bring de niro and pesci back together again and was,0.07306976
able to also have the opportunity to direct al pacino for the first time so,0.022368131
just bringing those legendary stars together for sort of one last hurrah together i think,0.029649897
was something i really appreciate about this movie and i think it's something that film,0.07111611
fans will cherish for a long time so i highly recommend this title on blu-ray,0.19036691
