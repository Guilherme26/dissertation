the story especially when it's very simple and pretty straightforward as an audience were exposed,0.01653314
to this Chinese culture and that was new to me but it was still really,0.06473967

care about and so we were able to connect in ways regardless if we understand,0.03172926
the culture are familiar with it now it was awesome to watch and I got,0.018355077
to tell you that a lot of the food that they showed really made me,0.030112198

mean they are all just genuine and human and so believable and that makes it,0.071905024
really easy to relate and sympathize with them now while there is a fair amount,0.013596354
of heavy drama to this I mean because you it's surrounding the idea of death,0.19582407
the filmmakers really sprinkle in just the right amount of humor at the right times,0.038049836
to keep us from going into the bell jar but it's not like overly funny,0.04198107
where you where you lose sight of the drama I mean it's just that perfect,0.10053187
balance it's really easy to fall in love with a family because the interactions are,0.04656219
genuine and heartfelt and they just feel so real and we get to know them,0.024628425
quirks and all as they just navigate this grief that they're going with and dealing,0.04997791
with the the imminent death of their grandmother but also trying to keep that smile,0.16037112
on their face so that she doesn't find out what's actually going on now I,0.12730151
know that seems a little bit weird and they expected to keep that secret from,0.062035028
somebody that you are dying the movie does a really good job of explaining it,0.10023386
and putting us into that culture so that we do get a good understanding of,0.061985802
why they would do that even though they may be struggling through it filmmakers also,0.036005724
employ some really great imagery I mean it's subtle but still really powerful I think,0.056002475
the simplicity of the story mixed with the complexity of the emotions and the beliefs,0.019956175
is really what makes this film stand out to me there were a few scenes,0.05461091
that were funny but also touching as well I mean there's one that involves the,0.048694104
family going to visit the grave of their grandfather and just that whole interaction and,0.13241611
even leading up to them getting to the grave just everything that encompasses that and,0.1291228
the dialogue that they're using is very powerful but also has some great humorous moments,0.020255508
to it there's also a drinking game that goes on at a wedding and it,0.038307928
is just like some jacked-up version of the funky chicken I have no idea what's,0.121650115
going on but it's really funny and then leads to a very emotional scene one,0.05849891
other one is part that we see in a trailer and it's Aquafina learning some,0.015525387
exercise moves from her grandmother and just the interactions that they have how touching it,0.050928455
is and still being able to be funny all the while and of course all,0.01869166
of those add humor but they also do such a good job to draw us,0.012496805
into the characters and into the story now if I were gonna nitpick there were,0.02122335
two shots that just kind of seemed to go on a little too long one's,0.16580899
an exterior of a building and the other is the cast walking and it looks,0.053222008
like they're in a music video it's just a slow-mo walk and both of those,0.11288366
just seem to sit on them a little too long even though they're great shots,0.11518121
but even if you were to trim them down you're only gonna save about 10,0.062231258
12 seconds at most so it's just it's negligent and it doesn't really matter and,0.07827549
again like I said that's only if I'm nitpicking and really trying to find something,0.014824282
that I felt was even remotely wrong with the movie the relationships also are so,0.027164105
well executed I mean they're grounded in reality and just so believable and you can,0.16549437
see yourself in them I mean I can see myself having one of these interactions,0.1334844
or being part of this family just being sucked in to the drama that I'm,0.28582424
seeing and then therefore the ride I don't know what kind of distribution the film,0.037066694
itself is gonna get but you should take every opportunity you can to see the,0.04222852
farewell it is that good it's a perfect mix of drama and humor with a,0.03281883
