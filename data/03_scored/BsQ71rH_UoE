hey everyone iron stuff Koza and welcome back to my channel today I am reviewing,0.0683308
a movie called eighth grade eighth grade was written and directed by Bo Burnham who,0.18403082
is most famously known as a comedian and an internet personality he's done a little,0.24194902
bit of acting but this is his directorial debut and I was very very excited,0.12622519
for this movie because I personally loved Bo Burnham I am a huge fan of,0.083548814
all of his comedy that he's ever done I remember watching him when he first,0.22026333
came out on YouTube and he was just like this little youtuber singing songs in,0.26555505
his bedroom he's also super young he's three years younger than me which kind of,0.27058533
makes me feel like cuz I'm like what am I doing with my life he's,0.24759516
already directed this first movie and I'm just sitting here in my shitty apartment filming,0.82333857
a YouTube video we can't all be superstars I guess but that's not the point,0.09294142
of this video the point of this video is to review this amazing movie also,0.15473054
sorry if the lighting in this video was like super dramatic there's like weird shadows,0.23356391
going on my light stand is not being my friend and I just have a,0.11030747
light on the floor going for a new cinematic video style today but anyways 8th,0.07075585
grade focus Steph let's go eighth grade is a movie about exactly what it sounds,0.09279771
like it's about eighth grade it's about the feeling experience the shittiness of being an,0.5876557
8th grader and just going into this I think that's kind of a great concept,0.15428653
for a movie because every time there's like a coming-of-age story or like a movie,0.0743751
about young people it's always like teenagers like high school or like way way yeah,0.12350467
like really little it's always this like high school coming-of-age story where you've already gone,0.17454161
through puberty maybe you're still going through it but you've like gotten over the really,0.12740865
terrible parts and it's almost like glorifying this young innocence and this like kind of,0.24029027
polished coming-of-age perspective but no one ever talks about that shitty shitty 8th grade nobody,0.94992846
ever looks back on their life and is like you know what 8th grade was,0.23976359
the best year of my life nobody in the history of the human race has,0.17625865
ever said that ever once not once eighth grade is when you're just like you,0.35121664
have acne you're like in the middle of puberty or like you're like in this,0.34784308
weird in-between phase of like I'm not really a kid but I'm not really like,0.08875768
a teenager quite yet you might be like 30 but even that is like you,0.15951166
don't really count your also at the very end of middle school which is the,0.14877252
worst years of anyone's life is middle school you're in the middle you're not young,0.37100226
you're not in elementary school you're not old enough to be at high school you're,0.5154597
just in this weird stupid limbo of not knowing who the you are so that's,0.82293
what this movie is about sorry if I just went on a rant about how,0.10960935
much I hated eighth grade it's just the worst that's the point no one ever,0.38371935
talks about it no one ever glorifies it no one ever puts the spotlight on,0.115335
it and that's what this movie does it's like hey remember eighth grade you probably,0.11198847
don't but now you will and that was something that I really appreciated about this,0.08933888
movie is it was forcing me to remember a time that I really don't ever,0.07709855
want to think about ever and it's also a time that personally I just like,0.04847865
pushed so far out of my mind that I don't even really remember it that,0.101841815
much but watching this movie brought it back so much and it was so real,0.08114159
and so intense basically let's let's talk about the actual movie and what it is,0.053328343
so this movie is about a girl a young girl in eighth grade she's very,0.27156147
shy she doesn't really have any friends at all she just lives with her dad,0.18839104
her mom is out of the picture it's just her her dad who's kind of,0.5154597
this goofy detached trying to understand his daughter but really can't because she's in eighth,0.6946068
grade and she's like get the away from me dad and that alone really shows,0.17117819
this very like eighth grade mentality of feeling super alone and feeling like your parents,0.31692865
don't understand you you can't even talk to your dad you don't really have any,0.29389957
friends you just feel super alone nobody understands me why that sort of thing and,0.1520286
it's kind of annoying like you kind of are annoyed by her like you don't,0.5154597
really like her which is weird to have a protagonist where you you don't really,0.15560924
like the protagonist you watch her and you're like oh stop but I'm not really,0.11510149
mad about it because nobody likes an eighth-grader sorry I would not be friends with,0.2435878
me when I was in eighth grade I was probably the worst everyone in eighth,0.2664469
grade is the worst in this movie captures that so well and it also captures,0.33081105
this eighth grade in a modern society so like the Internet is just like taken,0.35365987
over the world everyone cares about their online personalities and this girl this eighth-grade girl,0.4486604
she doesn't have any friends but she wants to be popular she wants to be,0.14846945
seen everyone has an Instagram they put their whole lives on it they just want,0.113087125
it they want an audience everybody wants an audience so she wants an audience so,0.059691098
she's like spends all of her time on snapchat and on Instagram and on YouTube,0.45240277
she has a YouTube channel where she posts videos that we kind of see the,0.1811801
vlog style video of her giving life advice and life tips and it's kind of,0.1527252
ironic because it's like her giving advice on things that she actually knows nothing about,0.15141687
so like she's this really shy awkward eighth-grade girl and she's trying to give advice,0.403292
to people about how to not be a shy awkward eighth-grade girl so it's just,0.53490317
kind of this cool perspective of like young people needing attention on the Internet and,0.096331246
while it is shown in a very modern way I feel like it's still relatable,0.07518816
at least for me because social media was still a thing when I was a,0.06494073
kid sort of need my space but it's that feeling of isolation and just craving,0.15439795
attention and like wanting people to like you so the movie is not like super,0.19413888
plot driven it's more just like a snapshot of this girl's life and we're just,0.40321702
kind of seeing her in the middle of eighth grade we kind of follow her,0.11219497
through the year and just like watch her suffer through this terribly awkward time I,0.4305602
do think this is one of those movies where if you don't relate to her,0.09297298
you probably won't enjoy it just because it is it's very slow the pacing is,0.14579754
it drags a lot which part of me feels like it's kind of necessary because,0.17845526
it's like this is a boring shitty time in this girl's life and it should,0.93232936
kind of drag but there were other times where I was like okay let's go,0.15338169
come on but I think it was like a stylistic choice to do it that,0.11041488
way so I don't know you might like it I had a little bit of,0.14741369
trouble with it but I think the only thing really keeping me in there was,0.15243839
that it was so relatable to me painfully relatable like there were moments in this,0.12668408
movie where she would say something or do something or be in some situation that,0.07159797
was so painfully relatable like I have 100% been in that exact place doing that,0.15535529
exact thing and I was like wow that sucked so much there's a lot of,0.794439
that in this movie so if you were like a shy awkward 8th grader overcome,0.53490317
with anxiety all the time then you will 100% relate to this movie I don't,0.05409186
know if you will like it but you will at least relate to it and,0.06223796
that's another thing I feel like this movie had a lot of like wow that's,0.06710135
me oh my god me same moments but that doesn't really necessarily make it a,0.051124744
good movie like it did a good job portraying those emotions and those feelings but,0.07887959
the movie itself as a whole was pretty good not the best thing I've ever,0.1353799
seen personally I think the edge of 17 while yes that is about a 17,0.058027636
year old and not an eighth grader very different still have very similar concepts and,0.15416138
I think that one did a much better job of capturing that story in like,0.052075934
a good movie with a solid plot this one is a little more loose it's,0.108161464
a little less of a like beginning middle end and more of a like here's,0.09569863
a chunk of this girl's life that sucks here yeah and I think another problem,0.8797051
that I had was just that she was just the worst I was like please,0.43380642
stop talking I want to murder you but it was interesting and it was a,0.82651454
cool thing to see and to think about and to see how social media is,0.054038912
warping young people's lives like that was actually just really concerning to see I was,0.12748347
like wow this is like a real thing that is happening to young people and,0.116689734
older people basically everyone everyone wants an audience all the time and that's what this,0.06309377
movie is also showing us and it's just like uh and I'm a hypocrite because,0.40308997
Here I am I'm sitting here talking to you on the Internet about a movie,0.12726767
that you could just go see and find out for yourself but instead you're here,0.1699613
listening to me so just having an existential crisis right now it's fine don't worry,0.10603877
about it let's move on so yeah eighth grade I liked it it made me,0.14160211
cry like a little girl it was very well shot very beautifully done very very,0.57879454
real one of those movies that every character feels incredibly real no one is like,0.08575598
polished there's not a lot of like makeup like you see people being human beings,0.50061774
in a very realistic setting which I do really appreciate especially for something like this,0.0637037
because it's 100% necessary I had a couple problems with the pacing a couple issues,0.06569289
with the plot not really feeling whole like it just sort of ends and you're,0.11165742
like okay I kind of got something from this but like it was missing something,0.07997893
but I will say this is a beautiful snapshot of what it is like to,0.0899239
be an awkward antisocial confused 8th grader it completely captures the feeling of needing to,0.31892347
be liked and wanting people to love you but also feeling completely afraid of everyone,0.04859431
and I think it also kind of makes you think about this wall that we,0.069607094
have between us and the world which is the internet so there's like us when,0.063226715
we put ourselves on the internet and the world sees it but it's kind of,0.07287102
this weird indirect thing I'm probably not gonna go stand up at a podium in,0.117383584
front of millions of people and talk to them the way I'm talking to you,0.1765033
right now but that's kind of what I'm doing but there's this wall that's like,0.06952516
my camera screen and the internet wall where it's like you're kind of over there,0.14822353
so it's not that scary and I think there's this weird disillusion where people don't,0.3049488
realize that that's actually what they're doing and I don't even realize it sometimes I,0.09166818
feel like nobody who puts themselves on the Internet really realizes how open that is,0.11692279
and how literally anyone in the whole world can see it and that is how,0.060996298
they're gonna perceive you and you could just be a total lie but nobody knows,0.4493152
because that's all I see this could get into a whole other huge rant about,0.19592407
internet culture and social media and I'm just gonna stop right there and get this,0.11819579
movie rating so I think 8th grade is a very impressive directorial debut from Bo,0.12042756
Burnham I was very impressed I was a little worried because like oh you're a,0.13854712
great comedian but like can you make a movie I don't know but I think,0.15253758
he can and I would see something that he makes again in the future if,0.09485302
he does that but considering the problems I mentioned it's not like a perfect movie,0.10306179
I think I'm gonna give it a 3.5 reading seems pretty good to me made,0.047844596
me feel a lot of things made me made me feel some of the stuffs,0.18115135
and things and stuff a lot of tears came out of this yeah okay that's,0.13857825
