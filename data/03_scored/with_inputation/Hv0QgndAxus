today on the daily review i'm going to be very professional because hi film students,0.123863265
at boston college in fm fm33901.01 fall semester american film genres monday devlin 023 5,0.06950468
to 5 30 i mean 3 to 5 30. hi welcome this is a supplement,0.17067215
to your class as well as part of my infamous youtube channel with thousands and,0.44386056
thousands and thousands of seconds of content today we're doing singing in the rain and,0.050571702
i'm gonna be super professional about it because this is the best nlgger uh it's,0.44716382
good it's a stanley doanen classic from 1952 today on the daily review with me,0.0822208
joel larocca all right guys all right so seriously all joking aside welcome to the,0.1202782
channel if you're new here what's up biandi one of the people i do know,0.107426696
that watches it all right so honestly in class uh tomorrow we're going to watch,0.14442313
the blues brothers and it's pretty fun it's pretty long so uh this is um,0.114618644
and because last week we had labor day or whatever and we didn't have monday,0.09224219
class so it was it was all disastrous let me get rid of hands cameras,0.40319183
it makes very little sense right now and od is not in here if she,0.15334013
shows up i guess i'll shut it off now too that camera's normally for my,0.26622182
dog if you're new to the channel uh she's downstairs anyway um so normally we,0.30273643
would have huh we would have watched uh those gels fell again that's the second,0.0852759
it's a theme on this channel that colored gels will fall in the background and,0.363281
scare me anyway uh um so yeah normally we would have watched singing in the,0.1647548
rain in class and then we would have discussed it but we didn't have it,0.037454907
because it was labor day and so i'm kind of trying to supplement this now,0.10520249
so i probably have sent this link to the class that's what you know all,0.055061832
the other regular viewers want to know what's going on but anyway i love this,0.060492102
movie singing the rain i think it's it's definitely my top five favorite comedies i,0.06451135
think it's just so perfect and joyful and colorful and full of hope and all,0.09832754
the things that comedies and musicals are kind of supposed to be about it's like,0.08717799
ah the human spirit is alive and it's tap dancing on my face i love,0.3254099
it um so i'm gonna kind of go through it more chronologically than we normally,0.15429512
do on this channel um so it's a satire it's a musical it's a romantic,0.12707053
comedy it's everything it's got so many things going on but it starts in a,0.08277016
very important time in hollywood 1927. what's important about that class somebody's hand goes up,0.077831596
maybe one of the really smart kids and they'll go well joe that's about the,0.09454082
time the jazz singer came out talkies are about hell yeah baby so uh yeah,0.3976051
the popularity of talking pictures starts really uh coming well not 1927 that's kind of,0.10332456
the first big hit with the jazz singer but it's not for a few more,0.17923428
years until all the theaters start converting but the big studios are like we gotta,0.071261585
do this we gotta make this switch so what the overall movie is about is,0.09161443
these two stars don lamont and lena oh no wait don lockwood and lena lamont,0.14184576
sorry uh they're like a on-screen duo of the silent era and now they're potentially,0.0766019
not going to make the transition very well because uh oh lena she talks like,0.19164926
this like uh i am holly quinn and so and she's not uh the brightest,0.40986785
bulb so she is gonna be hard to sell in the talking pictures and this,0.15303642
is based in reality there are so many silent stars that were like king and,0.047281124
queens of the world that could not make the transition for multiple many different reasons,0.082948446
and then they just kind of fizzled out uh so a lot this movie's about,0.14934058
adaptation a lot too anyway so it starts on the red carpet for the you,0.09884261
know a lockwood lamont new movie and it's so satirical it's great about how like,0.1431045
like uh how uh like they're there they're as happy as new newlyweds even after,0.21503463
two weeks of marriage you know like the you know the transient nature of relationships,0.068791784
in hollywood and how this whole movie's gonna be a behind the curtains look like,0.077463396
that everything we're seeing is like a facade you know it's like it's nlgger and,0.35774657
we know that but we still get caught up in it i still get caught,0.07010928
up in like tabloid nlgger when i don't know but because that's why we like,0.17080012
this stuff you know but in reality we know that those people are like completely,0.08992637
different than their personas you know because they're marketing themselves as a product so then,0.07838267
you know this woman is like you know luck would tell us about your life,0.397979
and it gives us like a through flashbacks that are contradictory to what he's saying,0.072372854
which is really genius about how he made his way up and it's dignity always,0.08936099
dignity and it's this lie about how we went to all the best schools and,0.20079388
learn how to dance but in reality it's how he was like a vaudevillian slowly,0.24117881
working his way up doing all these nlgger jobs and then was a stunt guy,0.40213832
and then eventually uh got a roll and uh it's great because it it it's,0.09280559
that's really like a great microcosm for what the media and hollywood is all about,0.07148822
how it's like they project this like disney image um and it's usually far from,0.06477145
the reality and it actually has like this really negative impact on society and we've,0.13971083
seen kind of the zenith of that with social media where it makes people really,0.05442647
really depressed and messes with people's heads and causes a lot of psychological problems when,0.31089434
you think that people are living this certain life for living this thing because all,0.21519345
you're seeing is a very you know like uh archaeologist level like dissection and pulling,0.14860702
out just these very specific things to to show the public to make them um,0.08337525
you know love you and not have any conflict odie wants to be enhancing never,0.15396698
mind never mind i thought he was trying to get in the door but it's,0.10860789
not it wasn't it was my roommate going into his room okay anyway um yeah,0.15258746
so all that stuff is great and like i was saying social media this ends,0.1012279
up working nicely and like still be continuing to be an issue of how the,0.08259223
public sees um media figures and when i say media i don't just mean the,0.089796014
movies you know and music i'm talking about like politics which has become the same,0.06557207
thing you know especially in the trump era anyway um there's one part that i,0.07578827
feel like is um like the the kind of like pinnacle moment of that whole,0.069873914
sequence is that they're all the audience is all looking at lena and how beautiful,0.06448159
she is and one woman just goes she's so refined i think i'll kill myself,0.8792377
and that's when you realize that this movie is a beaver if this movie had,0.07777374
to be an animal it would be a beaver because like a beaver is smart,0.31089434
and it's cute and it's industrious but has really sharp teeth right it's social and,0.07629484
it's kind it'll share its damn with muskrats and all sorts of stuff but it's,0.79202574
unique and and you realize ah that this is gonna be a beaver of a,0.057578165
movie water is just gonna roll right off its back and just put it you,0.19252726
know and you look at like oh but it can nlgger take your finger off,0.39518982
like it's still got teeth it's still sharp it's not like hey hey hollywood's great,0.3027031
like top hat or some one of these other musicals from earlier you know maybe,0.099343576
one of the ones you watched for your old one because it's kind of late,0.12304031
in that in that time period uh but those earlier ones like in the code,0.09046122
era are very watered down you know this is still in the code era but,0.085701615
it's it's snake-like in its beaverness okay the metaphors are getting too mixed up anyway,0.14879279
so then we go to the that's the premiere of royal rascal and that's like,0.31089434
a big silent hit and uh at the after party uh we meet well we,0.10983894
meet kathy sheldon that's debbie reynolds character as he's trying to get away from all,0.1495047
this stuff and then you get they get to the after party and rf simpson,0.12502953
who's like the big producer in the movie is like i gotta show you something,0.11365677
and it's a talkie it's a talking picture kind of example and it's like this,0.089719266
is the new thing jazz singer is coming out it's gonna be the big new,0.06364457
thing uh and but uh you know we'll see maybe it won't be maybe it'll,0.1284596
just be a fly by the night i think obviously three weeks later it's the,0.10363576
big new thing so the movie they're working on dueling cavaliers uh is going to,0.10062848
be transitioned into a musical so uh uh not a musical excuse me a talkie,0.18873315
and uh wait it i spoiled it damn uh and uh so lena's gotta make,0.7451786
the transition in one of the most famous and comical scenes uh they the quiet,0.1061415
rolling that whole sequence of adjusting to the sound i think i've used that in,0.07737254
like every class i've taught because it's funny it's well shot it's well acted and,0.37123096
then on top of it it's got this great his memorable historic thing of like,0.06539491
what it's like to have a technological change in the industry and have everybody kind,0.116931506
of adjusting to microphones because you see it in cinema that like in the silent,0.09274465
film era like the late silent films are doing the craziest stuff some of the,0.16379967
craziest stuff you've ever seen like just as innovative as anything that comes out today,0.53490317
and then the second you put sound and confined confine it to a sound stage,0.12113611
and have to have all the prerequisites that you need for sync sound it really,0.06477145
limits the movement of the camera and all the creativity that goes into um making,0.15307444
a movie because now you got to get it kind of like it reset the,0.101773016
industry for a long period of time it took a while for them to get,0.070727095
their legs back uh no pun intended anyway uh so uh there's this relationship starting,0.49956596
to happen there's the phony relationship between lockwood and lamont but then there's this relationship,0.10408646
that he starts having with kathy sheldon who's like an up and coming dancer and,0.24104445
who wants to break into the business but she's honest and she's very talented she'd,0.119583026
be a good uh a good actress in this new world because she's a triple,0.25257427
threat she can sing dance and act as opposed to lena lamont who's also a,0.2258505
triple threat because she can't sing can't dance and can't act which i've always thought,0.31089434
is really clever just like put a spin on the word threat there uh there's,0.14413998
a great scene that really shows when they start falling in love cathy and don,0.11019071
uh it's like in an open sound studio they go in the sound stage and,0.09000907
they go in there and he turns on the fan and the music and the,0.076591566
lights and i mean the fan and the smoke machine the lights and they kind,0.08549951
of have a love scene as as they say um and it's really beautiful and,0.08050843
it reminds me of that scene in la la land that sucks that movie's stupid,0.88824683
and it sucks and it looks stupid and everything's cheesy it's like a nlgger gap,0.9156528
commercial from the 90s i hate it i hate the characters in that movie and,0.31089434
what they're after is so stupid and i hate la la land whoa whoa something,0.8510835
broken him anyway after the soundstage scene is the elocution scene uh i got ahead,0.09623724
of myself when i did the quiet rolling the elocution scene is the most fun,0.104052804
scene in nlgger musical history that wrote moses supposes his noses of roses and moses,0.13377668
supposes erroneously that whole thing is awesome and and and donald o'connor that's the other,0.11563038
guy that's cosmo brown the piano player maybe his character is gay do you ever,0.82819206
think about that i think about it a lot um i think that i think,0.07032083
he is and they kind of just dance around it his oh my god his,0.112954326
performance in that is like holy schnikes as we used to say back when anyway,0.10024208
i was gonna say i mean chris farley was alive but uh we're gonna talk,0.1528084
about chris farley because we're watching the nlgger blues brothers and you can't talk about,0.46923092
belushi without talking about farley okay so anyway then it could that goes to the,0.15190893
quiet rolling scene and everything the movie's gonna be a flop and that's when they,0.09862166
come up with the idea hey let's make it a musical oh no lena can't,0.06021423
sing let's dub her voice with kathy's and that's kind of the second plot point,0.2513399
the first plot point being meeting kathy sheldon and realizing it's a combination of that,0.11934785
and realizing that we're going to have to go the direction of talkies and then,0.061250363
the second plot point is we have a way of making this our own we,0.054226045
can do the things we know and we can use the technology right we can,0.0285556
adapt to the technology and use dubbing so that lena can just lip sync and,0.06482069
then kathy can actually be singing for it's you know it's pretty brilliant and obviously,0.09328319
lena finds out and she doesn't want the crowd not because the third act is,0.1011355
all chaos i'm not going to go into detail you should watch it uh i,0.2647715
don't want to really spoil anything for the people who are not in the class,0.1291797
but that idea of like lena's going to ruin kathy's career by saying fine she,0.15691252
can play my voice but nobody knows and she has to do it forever like,0.14288178
as opposed to it just being like a way to launch her career so uh,0.23956718
i love it is so good and uh that image of lena lips singing and,0.24166434
then we see that and then we see behind the stage we see kathy actually,0.054769814
singing for her it's like just a great you know the misonsen as we say,0.10839625
so you have to be filmic because it's a class and stuff uh you know,0.17220148
it's this beautiful like example of what the movie's all about that it's like it,0.106778905
that the truth is not what's being shown to the audience what's being shown to,0.05872321
the audience is is all fabricating it's all nlgger it might make you feel something,0.25111014
but it's not reality what reality is is happening behind the behind the curtain you,0.13179657
know um which is like a complicated and beautiful metaphor and maybe i'm thinking too,0.101952456
deeply about it to give my life meaning because i've spent so much time thinking,0.1335617
about movies and the arts and the meaning it has for people um it's just,0.0619437
a nlgger beaver of a movie dude and if you don't know what i mean,0.5876557
watch a nlgger documentary about a beaver it changes its environment if it if it,0.3458091
wants something it goes i'm going to use my skills which is non-down trees and,0.12680577
making dams to literally change the environment and flood the forest so i can catch,0.093714245
fish stuff like that it's literally it's crazy i don't know it's got everything and,0.24201125
i love that idea that it's hopeful and kind and one of these documentaries i,0.06571228
watched it's like advantageous for them to make a little compartment in their damn for,0.7362802
muskrats because they take care of like bugs and other things like that and they,0.29108456
like live in a symbiotic relationship and i was like oh that's just like that's,0.09952994
like it see i'm used to i usually use the food metaphor for people to,0.078129694
take my classes about you know kind of schlocky crap movies that hollywood pumps out,0.86675996
a lot of times they're like candy bars they're fun to watch you eat them,0.19021924
you're satisfied for a few minutes and whatever and you ye get some energy but,0.15535562
then and you know it's actually killing you and rotting your teeth and ruining your,0.8903576
organs and it's not giving you a lot of nutrition um but sometimes when you,0.3127132
eat a big you know nice meal that has the greens and the meats and,0.085019365
the or proteins we'll say for non-meat eaters and you know and all the vitamins,0.08348014
and minerals you need maybe you don't like eating the brussels sprouts but it's gonna,0.14968163
sustain you for much longer and it's gonna give you like some actual nourishment and,0.102114
better you um and i truly feel that way and if that sounds elitist i,0.15711074
don't nlgger care i don't nlgger care anymore whatever find them i'm elitist about movies,0.22589754
and stuff sorry you know whatever i don't know what to say hey let's go,0.19465856
through the song list so there's 12 basically i might be a little bit off,0.23846576
because there's some kind of iconic kind of medleys i guess you could call it,0.07554928
uh songs but i just want to go through them to help people who might,0.14127274
have to write a paper about this here's a little help these aren't the exact,0.17899843
names but uh a fit as a fiddle and ready for love that should be,0.12663421
fit as a fiddle and ready to ask if you want to keep the alliteration,0.13530117
going which would be fun but that's essentially what it means and it's during that,0.06349307
opening sequence on the red carpet during a flashback and it's like the violin vaudeville,0.12680459
song and it's awesome oh my god they're them working together um uh i almost,0.097315766
said fred astaire uh what what the hell's his name oh my god i am,0.40313116
fired gene kelly jesus yeah gene kelly and uh o'connors there have just like such,0.47561762
great chemistry and they can just like move in sync so well it's great um,0.046079148
yeah that one that one's amazing then all i do is dream about you that's,0.12652017
when um we meet kathy and she jumps out of the cake and she's doing,0.113558136
like the flapper kind of dance that kind of stuff which is so fun and,0.12528437
then and then there's the then we get our first uh uh cosmo brown song,0.16369666
and make him laugh which looks like the most painful dance sequence next to that,0.18064135
one the jump jive one with the uh nichols brothers or whatever they're like jumping,0.16213441
down the stairs landing in splits this is just about as bad and so he,0.25704268
severely he used to smoke four packs of cigarettes a day so this is really,0.14549382
hardened and he was like in the hospital after doing this sequence and like something,0.14323346
went wrong with the film so they had to do it again and he nlgger,0.40337315
did it and it's so badass it's like jackie chan or something he's like destroying,0.5154597
his body just to make you laugh and hopefully when you watch this in your,0.36086428
dorm you did laugh because he nlgger deserves it because he did this like 80,0.5553721
years ago and it's still awesome and even the award-winning lotted musicals of nowadays look,0.059539754
like a comedy joke like a satire about how to make a nlgger you know,0.40334752
it looks like like we're not actually gonna dance but this would look this is,0.09898684
roughly what it would look like if we had talent you know and this they're,0.10492903
like throwing and he does the run up the wall in the backflip it looks,0.21601549
like special effects and it's all real and they're not even like messing with the,0.1302211
camera speed or anything anyway then there's the i got uh uh uh a uh,0.19234796
i got a feeling you're foolin i gotta be you foolin what i gotta feel,0.8431421
when you're foolin uh that's the one where it's like a kind of in uh,0.78676313
beautiful girls is basically the scene yeah uh and it's like a fashion video video,0.42489713
film or whatever showing how talking pictures are gonna evolve or whatever and one time,0.078119904
i'll tell you one time when i was much younger i took magical mushrooms and,0.103380255
don't do that but i did it i was forced at gunpoint i was much,0.1981298
younger this is like at least 15 18 months ago and uh i watched this,0.13397382
movie on a high resolution screen on blu-ray like this close to it and during,0.109628916
that sequence where there's all that pink glitter in the background the guys yells to,0.08368821
the bullhorn i was like movies are alive hey odie just entered i'll put on,0.2893236
her camera odie going up so there you go odie's in here now you can,0.22541407
all yay she's probably gonna make a little bed and lie down good for her,0.3614031
okay so anyway um that one's awesome and then we talked about uh maybe we,0.07595696
shouldn't go through all of these that may be the problem with doing psychedelic drugs,0.25195313
is that you lose your brain a lot now i have no idea what i'm,0.5554515
talking about okay uh life was a song you came along you were meant for,0.171675
me that whole seek that sequence is great that's the one on the sound stage,0.067752555
i was talking about that's like la la land and then we go on to,0.06036016
moses supposes which is so exuberant and then good morning that's their first of all,0.075045325
three of them together it's so classic uh good morning that's when they realize hey,0.07673534
wait we make it a musical um and then there's broadway melody i don't like,0.06519108
that well i was singing in the rain obviously after that which is like the,0.04874897
second plot point peak thing and it's like so hopeful for the future and then,0.060695235
there's broadway melody which is another that's kind of a tangent the movie goes on,0.083521225
i think it's probably one of the weaker parts of the movie although this movie,0.10008106
is a 10 out of 10. that's the one part and then it's the shows,0.062646
like the dancing cavalier which is what the song the movie becomes uh when it,0.15944049
becomes a musical the would you song and uh it's good that one's not super,0.09133537
funny either this is the one like lull in the movie not that it's much,0.061083715
of a low you know this i i to take one little point off this,0.18695618
movie you know at some point but then they're singing the rainbow prize which is,0.051058814
done you know whenever we reveal that kathy is doing the voice and then he,0.077629626
sings you are my lucky star and it's good full circle because at the end,0.081670485
they kiss in front of us singing the rain poster and then you're like is,0.09133058
this the movie and it's like it's like inception that's great um i like when,0.11316781
lena loman says i make more money than calvin coolidge combined that doesn't make any,0.10216265
sense but i love it oh god make more money than cabbage school is combined,0.12908879
uh okay so anyway that was my run through basically the plot and the songs,0.18639153
