hey film fans hey so i'm back and i'm going to review inside our which the new disney pixar movie i've been resisting reviewing this for a few days because i absolutely loved it and I feel like I have to say something negative about it to balance the reviewer but there isn't really anything negative to say in my opinion and the plot line revolves around young girl called Riley from her birth onwards through her life and shows the story as personified by the emotions in her brain I have to admit I can't remember being this excited about pixar movie for a long time I was very young when toy story came out and I absolutely adored it and I don't think I've enjoyed one as much since so for me this is the big deal at this point of actually in the movie twice I saw it on Sunday loved it the next day I was meant to be my friend to see I already seen it so I said to her do you still want to see inside out she was like do you and I was like well I saw it yesterday but I'd see it again she was like I saw yesterday but I'd see you again as well so we both decided to see you again yesterday and we buddies absolutely loved it again because it's just a beautiful beautiful story I think it's really good as well because although obviously attended kids to some extent there's so much for adults there it's almost possible there's more for adults than there is for kids but I was sitting next to a young child and the first viewing and although he didn't seem to entirely follow it he did seem to enjoy himself which I guess the key thing I feel like it might help kids grow up and think about their emotions and how their brains working from an early age so it could be like almost counseling for via cartoons the characters were amazing obviously they were very varied because they were betraying different spectrum emotions great voice cast Amy Poehler from Parks and Recreation Mindy Kaling from the office and Phyllis Smith from the office as well so great comedians I also spotted agent Cooper from Twin Peaks as the voice of the Father as we come to expect from Pixar is absolutely beautiful to look at really psychedelic really great character just great you know such a variation between the real world and the world inside the child's mind as well yeah I really wanted to give you something negative a bit of a butt but I just can't I can't think of anything negative i absolutely love this movie both times as inventive it was creative it was colorful it was fun that was funny but it was also really moving I cried at least twice in fact I would say if you are a living breathing human bring tissues you will cry everyone cries also special shout-out should go for the absolutely gorgeous short film the girls at the beginning which again is probably my favorite of all the short films that go before a disney pixar it's called lava and it's about a lonely volcano falling in love there's told through a lovely ukulele song but what are you guys do you know it as much side you'd let me know in the comments and I'd love it if you subscribe to my channel it would make my day
