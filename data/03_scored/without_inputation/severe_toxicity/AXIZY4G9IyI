not good and it's so straining on that person their body and mind and i,0.2809499

i feel like you're describing depression she has no identity and no hap like no,0.05554217
way feeling happy because joy's gone her core personalities and everything is just gone that,0.02767563

hurts it's like she's losing a part of herself part for personality damn i'm relating,0.44335672
to this way too much it's actually hurting ugh that's sad why is this movie,0.036447406
just sad without even trying i mean it's probably trying if you want to walk,0.04924288
the long way go for it but riley needs to be happy i'm not missing,0.050929785
that train bing bong knows what he's doing he's part dolphin they're very smart joy's,0.048610955
a narcissist i just realized that she's like riley needs me like i know she,0.22779393
needs to be happy like but like you know what i mean she thinks a,0.031165184
lot too much about herself that is my favorite oh it's so soft oh let,0.035394423
me try hey what's the big idea you better fix that wall or else you're,0.023318013
invincible he just murdered somebody okay i like bing bong that's wow yeah i stashed,0.6278611

moon he is destroying everything like all around him i would have sworn sparkle pony,0.21234724
mount was right here hey what's going on well yeah i i don't know princess,0.079257965
dream world oh the stuffed animal hall of fame oh oh they're tearing down her,0.15223326
old imaginations okay because it's old and she's growing up okay that's sad ah this,0.0936665
whole movie is just showing about growing up and like all the changes as we,0.02551711
can see in her mind her imagination being forgotten her memories being thrown away just,0.042705454
a lot of things changing oh gosh why does that make me so emotional once,0.056582518
we flew back in time we had breakfast twice that day see i love how,0.02044309
sadness is comforting sadness is like there's a use for her we were best friends,0.018106963
if you can't understand that pain yeah i can't connect with people no these facts,0.035295308
and opinions look so similar ah don't worry about it happens all the time that's,0.036772683
hilarious actually that that yeah how about we wake her up sadness that's ridiculous how,0.1917445
could we possibly how about we wake her up great idea jordan thanks come on,0.07434691
yeah narcissist joy is a narcissist we're gonna make her so happy she'll wake up,0.33174574
with exhilaration we'll excite her awake and that's never that's not possible if you're happy,0.29794905
in a dream you want to stay dreaming you just don't want to wake up,0.07671696
like i just wanted to sleep for 10 hours like i was not tired anymore,0.08512222
but i felt my dream made me feel happy so i stayed sleeping that is,0.026604686
terrifying that's really all you care about your friend is being locked up this looks,0.1049866
so cool i really like the way subconscious looks you know for a fact there's,0.028584937
like some badass thoughts down there in the subconscious it's broccoli is black looking that,0.23252717
terrifying i never hated this i actually usually always liked it candy wrappers why is,0.046014745
he in a clown jail with like balloons that's hilarious oh because there's a crowd,0.3362773
okay are kind of scary i mean i've never had an encounter with clowns i,0.24345092
wouldn't know i mean yeah i think like some clouds are scary like i feel,0.081131786
like people who make like some kinds of scary because they got a way to,0.063040785
be scary but i'm i don't know i have not i've not like had a,0.034291547
personal bad experience with the clown that you are making so much noise can you,0.23668662
not okay that's that is concerning okay that is creepy did you say birthday this,0.062343005
time is freaking me out i promise okay can you please stop no that's not,0.33318484
it was a dream this is ridiculous we can't even get a good night's sleep,0.25615063
anymore time to take action stupid mom and dad if they had moved us none,0.6491742
of this would have happened i'm like anger's character i like that he's taking control,0.06984362
and he's representing what would actually happen like the feelings and emotions that would you'd,0.01841694
feel in this situation stop you're hurting riley no no no i did it again,0.11895612
if you get in here these core memories will get sad i'm sorry riley needs,0.02526434
to be happy joy is really pissing me off like she's really the villain here,0.38157043
leaving sadness behind and stuff like that only focusing on herself and wanting to feel,0.09867201
happy oh my god this is pixar did such a good analogy with this okay,0.047312517
that has given me some avengers memories that that okay that scared me and it's,0.099146955
like your subconscious fear oh okay okay this is making me sad wow she used,0.09826026
to stick her tongue out when she was coloring it's feeling like someone died and,0.33924687
it's like just her memories but it's like feeling like a part of her diary,0.047050435
basically heard that she died and it's actually sad i don't like that three tears,0.14022072
came now oh my eyes burned now two tears came out bedtime i hate it,0.5605894
seeing those things fade away it just makes me sad it was the day the,0.028240371
prairie dogs lost the big playoff thing marley missed the winning challenge this is a,0.047971047
great thing about how happiness can only come once you like sadness after sadness and,0.04214936
like events like or it's just like it's yin yang they both have to come,0.04100458
together it balances out which is true all the time though if you're sad someone,0.032348547
will come and help you but that's not it's not always the case and that,0.023514241
sucks that really does okay gosh this is giving me way too much infinity vibes,0.53056633
i'm not this one i'm not liking it's giving me a lot of experiments oh,0.042467985
that's so heartbreaking take her to the moon for me okay why don't you fade,0.12511572
away like that just so not fair that is so not it's so not okay,0.0668004
this is shady as hell i feel worried for you just let me go riley's,0.18877447
better off without me coming oh my god why is that why is this movie,0.08880068
just hitting different like santa's being like let me go joey's better off without me,0.243777
because you know when you're like sad or like depressed you're just like you just,0.25368318
wanted to go away you just want the sadness go away you want you want,0.14262868
to be happy it's legit this is this is the embodiment of that we can't,0.017175706
make riley feel anything oh that is that's terrible she is fully honestly she is,0.07918014
fully committed to the whole she's like the deepest sad she's depressed depressed ah poor,0.13742428
rally like feeling that at such a young age i don't think you printed enough,0.078928694
boyfriends that's okay i love that i love the dedication design for her yep loving,0.031062746
that and we don't support dying for something oh i wish joy was here kind,0.10775975
of dumb but i'm just saying in this movie's house well what would you do,0.37688878
if you're so smart i tell you but you're too dumb to understand what of,0.4307034
course your tiny brain is confused i love i like disgust like i like her,0.45370415
personality she seems like that sassy friend i think you're really kind of like mean,0.33661342
i don't know like could be bullying others but like she's not really like that,0.08668473
and she's not like a boy for you you know what i mean riley oh,0.13144362
we were worried sick where have you been it's so late okay i'm i'm liking,0.12726758
this so far the like ending and so i don't know i just feel like,0.03937355
pixar's gonna come out and just hit you but but okay wow okay this is,0.14920469
something a lot harder than i thought it would this is not okay i know,0.042260446
you don't want me to but i miss home i miss minnesota you need me,0.049710505
to be happy but i want my old friends and my hockey team i want,0.029782267
to go home please don't be mad i'm so glad she's talking to her parents,0.20704573
oh i'm glad that she's talking and they're being nice gosh why does pixar do,0.0670259
this to us in that song we heard in the beginning that like soft instrumental,0.023136418
oh it's going back again hey i'm liking this new view friendship island's expanded glad,0.036045637
they finally opened that friendly argument section i like tragic vampire romance island fashion island,0.05520625
oh everyone shut up boyband island hope that's just a phase say what you want,0.24451345
i think it's all beautiful i love that there you go i love that expanded,0.042497918
console is up she's um maturing and going through so more emotions expanded consoles guys,0.0431345
what's puberty yeah oh it's probably not important sorry okay i love that i love,0.1460537
that okay um wow tears came out of me with that one okay that was,0.081663266
something that was something i felt and dealt with with a lot of tears um,0.076740906
i really like inside out i really like what it teaches you and like what,0.08562377
it tells and like for people i don't know like i i can like emotionally,0.11496103
connect to it and pixar is just really great at doing that um i'm sorry,0.031128598
if i wasn't like as energetic and like funny and silly as i would be,0.34548864
during this commentary just like this movie i connect to it a little bit too,0.07562606
much and like i didn't i honestly did not know what to say sometimes and,0.040742498
like i didn't know what joke jokes to make or anything it was like i,0.031895556
was just like watching absorbing and i didn't want to like talk too much like,0.017337346
preaching this so that's why i was kind of like that um and it's like,0.040937398
late in the afternoon it's like what it's one and so i am um i'm,0.036732107
a little bit tired but i'm not like that tired but yeah i am um,0.052852165
yeah i think more people show attention in inside out it's it's a really good,0.079402305
movie and like as someone who's like been the press before that was like complete,0.06797179
that was such a good way to represent it like forcing happiness on top of,0.03312282
yourself like being like i need to be happy and hating sadness like hating sadness,0.1560022
so much thinking it's so like useless and it's like why why do i feel,0.17685704
sad just like yeah and all the anger the fear to discuss that comes with,0.03497602
that like towards sadness and towards just everything that doesn't make you happy it's just,0.019697418
like so it's so true and i really like that and i really like like,0.024460798
at the end they like accept sadness and realize that sadness has like you need,0.024624433
it in your emotions you need to feel sadness like to feel empathy like with,0.048311625
helping bing bong like i mean my sense of empathy has grown but also because,0.06738776
of sadness the thing the things like i took for granted before things i loved,0.04791717
i loved even more like i loved tv before but now i love tv even,0.02935655
more not being able to feel the happiness that it once gave me and then,0.05249962
regaining that happiness i'm never gonna let that go and just like it just like,0.07557284
yeah i am not the same person i was a year ago but i like,0.031105317
this person i am now i like the videos i'm making on youtube that makes,0.13678703
me happy like all the people i'm connecting with with you so that makes me,0.07856018
happy i like continuing watching tv and trying and um applying for college to be,0.035910603
director applying for college is so hard and stressful so wish me luck with that,0.0317266
but yeah that's what i like inside out and i'm sorry this wasn't my like,0.045866407
giddy up happy video and like you're probably not gonna like it but like i'm,0.1666212
glad i watched it and said these things in front of the camera because at,0.03385585
least i said it in front of people instead of just thinking it so people,0.0736937
know how i feel whoever does watch this but i'm yeah anyway stop talking about,0.15109979
myself that was a good movie and like anyone who's feeling sad i should probably,0.038551383
