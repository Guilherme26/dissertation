we've a wonderful evenings entertainment lined up for you hey what's up guys this is,0.075179055
Stephie AKA in my humble opinion and welcome back to another iMHO of movie review,0.079027146
so in today's video i'm going to be talking about the newly released comedy coming-of-age,0.09965249
film entitled book smart so book smarts stars beanie Feldstein caitlin denver Billie lourd Noah,0.0855812
Galvin Skyler gasps Ando Jessica Williams Jason Sudeikis Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte the movie,0.033416167
is the directorial debut of Olivia Wilde and it was written by Susannah Fogle Emily,0.03510374
Halpern Sarah Hoskins and Katie Silverman book smart is about two highschool besties named Amy,0.13272277
and Molly and they have worked their asses off to get into the Ivy League's,0.41899335
at the cost of having a social life filled with parties and fun so the,0.023146395
school that they attend has this policy of not telling anybody where you're going to,0.029609319
college after you graduate and the day before their graduation they are horrified to learn,0.030495344
that their peers who they basically looked down on for partying throughout all of high,0.04968789
school also got into Ivy League's and other equally good schools and one of them,0.014653996
even has a job offer at Google so AV and Molly taken upon themselves to,0.039434746
fit four years of high school partying into one night and of course a lot,0.05374085
of goes down and it makes for a really really entertaining movie so as all,0.045418072
my movie reviews I'm gonna be talking about the pros the cons and then I'm,0.072503686
gonna be giving my overall rating so here we go alright so Pro number one,0.0855945
for me is the casting so there's lots of young actors new faces in this,0.056462783
movie which is really really refreshing casting for the two leads was perfect spot on,0.037919458
the side characters as well we're also really really great like Billie lourd for me,0.03617335
among the side characters was a standout every time she literally pops up like quite,0.032786235
literally pops up in this movie it's it's such a joy she's so funny Skylar,0.08766123
DiSanto I've never really watched any of his pre guesswork he's really funny as well,0.057102025
I know I keep saying they're all really funny but like genuinely they're all really,0.022519127
funny the adult cast like Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte play the parents of Caitlyn,0.056660343
Denver is great to see Jessica Williams in this as like the cool teacher and,0.018089004
then Jason Sudeikis plays their principal who is like so over his job casting and,0.029724397
that level of talent for your adult cast just gives this movie the comedic credit,0.064599976
that it really does deserve all right Pro number two for me is the chemistry,0.07108419
between your two leads so again your bleeds are played by beanie Feldstein and Katelyn,0.04966727
Denver they played the two best friends Amy and Molly I believe the first seen,0.011967319
of them is Amy picking up Molly from where she lives to you know go,0.04203096
to school just in that first scene alone like just the way that they interact,0.034860946
with each other and like their little inside jokes you can just tell that there's,0.052645296
such good friends they really play off well with one another and I don't know,0.032716393
how much of what they did together was improvised but it feels like they're just,0.041542713
like making it up on the spot and aside from obviously the comedic moments the,0.02839935
the dramatic scene which is when they fight you really take that to heart and,0.05801399
that's seem really it feels very personal because throughout the movie you have seen what,0.023139743
close friends these two girls are and how far they're willing to go for one,0.120408885
another that when they do get to the point in the movie where they have,0.020298744
that big dramatic fight scene it feels it feels very heartbreaking and sad my third,0.06382304
pro this movie was Olivia Wilde's direction you know what you go girl I didn't,0.06755006
know you had it in you but apparently you did she directed the out of,0.035027906
this movie this movie is so well directed and it's amazing that this is her,0.06666803
directorial debut she made so many interesting artistic choices in the way that you chose,0.025660124
to tell this story like for instance when Molly finds out that all the other,0.015549333
kids in her school got into amazing colleges when she loses it it is so,0.2032595
reminiscent to me of Tracy Flick in election and I feel like by making those,0.050301854
subtle references to those other iconic dark comedy teen centric movies you can tell that,0.05856809
Olivia Wilde studied movies took what those movies did great and made it her own,0.17961954
like she really really did her homework how's the director one of your jobs is,0.018609842
to try and get the best performance out of your actress and I feel like,0.13237222
Olivia Wilde was able to get amazing performances it feels like she's definitely an actor's,0.112173244
director because she knows that world so well therefore she knows how to communicate to,0.03757955
her cast and the acting in general in this movie just came off as so,0.093870714
natural all right my fourth pro to this movie and it's a big one it,0.0729028
succeeded so well in representing its genre which to me is a coming-of-age teen comedy,0.07912825
like I said a million times throughout this entire review this movie is genuinely funny,0.042511888
I pretty much laughed throughout the entire thing and my theatre was laughing out loud,0.06544676
with me the entire movie is a journey because it's these two girls trying to,0.08428143
get to this popular guys house party so along the way they have a lot,0.042379513
of missteps to get to the party and they find themselves in the most random,0.025121326
situations but honestly while I was watching the movie I didn't even care if they,0.03599508
ended up making the party or not because the getting there was so much fun,0.05577432
and then of course as a coming-of-age movie I definitely felt like there were so,0.05129364
many moments where you saw these characters come of age first of all the ticking,0.033711508
clock here is the fact that they're graduating so that's a huge milestone in anybody's,0.027863212
life and then you see both of these girls trying to have like their first,0.08326835
sexual experiences and their friendship throughout the course of this movie is tested a teenagers,0.14067304
in this movie like they acted and sounded like teenagers and 20-19 it's been a,0.049174365
while since I've been a teenager but for me my perspective of teenagers in 2019,0.03067827
is that they're so smart and witty and fast they're very socially and culturally aware,0.014329386
of what is going on they're a bit on edge and unsure of themselves but,0.044509433
I mean who isn't as a teenager and teenagers especially in 2019 are all about,0.038220786
being their authentic self so I really feel like they nailed that persona all right,0.060054775
so now talking about the cons my first itty-bitty con it's very nitpicky is that,0.028335493
I did not understand why Amy during their fight did not how Molly what she,0.056425534
saw I just felt like for me the girl seemed smarter than that the movie,0.0713609
seems smarter than that and I get that this was sort of like the friendships,0.05078677
breaking point you know this was supposed to be a high moment of tension for,0.02463042
these characters for this story but I just felt like it was so unrealistic that,0.026366549
at no point whatsoever while they were fighting Amy would not try to tell Molly,0.031535026
what she saw my second con this is a bigger con now is I hated,0.19288662
what they did with Jessica Williams character for Jessica Williams to be this black woman,0.009404367
who is also like the cool teacher in the school was like yes amazing but,0.016018288
then they give her this like really creepy storyline in the movie where after she,0.13385424
drives the girls to the party she goes inside the house this is a high,0.12092174
school party by the way and then one of the male students who has like,0.061551437
a crush on her starts flirting with her and then she starts flirting back and,0.1869033
then later on we learned that I guess she slept with him and I'm not,0.19578484
quite sure if this high school student is a legal consenting age but still that's,0.03702545
really really creepy and I just hate that they gave the only pretty much main,0.09299001
cast person of color that's storylines that character deserved better and Jessica Williams deserved better,0.15233104
all right so my overall rating for this movie is a solid a-minus this movie,0.039181978
is very fun very entertaining the characters are genuinely funny and I felt like I,0.022437975
was on a wild adventure with them however and this is a big however and,0.049530238
honestly I was debating whether or not to include this particular portion in my cons,0.026312005
list because I don't even I don't even know if this is a fair critique,0.058315985
and I'm gonna call myself out on it maybe this isn't a fair critique maybe,0.029694462
I'm just complaining but the movie is very white then I struggle if that's a,0.12079669
valid critique when I went on like my whole Twitter rampage at 2:00 in the,0.050474133
morning questioning if something is - white is a fair critique I got a variety,0.098812364
of responses something like yeah that is a fair thing to point out but then,0.025616223
I got another interesting reply that was like maybe your critique isn't necessarily that it,0.028137933
felt white but that it lacked diverse and the thing is this movie actually technically,0.028811099
didn't lack diversity you have the cold teacher being played by a black woman Molly,0.2918859
and Amy's classmates are racially diverse Noah galvans character in this movie he's gay and,0.026496924
his friend in the movie is black and gay I mean like technically they are,0.6194407
checking off these like boxes I guess to say and I hate I hate putting,0.13291301
it in those terms but sometimes I feel like that's what these movies are doing,0.031015517
it's like we're not gonna give like people of color the main roles we're just,0.3412928
gonna give them these side roles to check off the boxes I don't believe that's,0.027150135
what they were doing with this movie but because you positioned those sorts of characters,0.053799387
as side characters it kind of feels like that's what is happening here and I,0.013265758
get why this story's about two white girls in high school this story was written,0.16382742
by four white ladies the movie is directed by a white lady and your main,0.053817347
leads are two white girls they have every right to tell that story because that's,0.15500641
their experience of living in this world and quite frankly they they execute that story,0.13015382
so well in this movie but maybe for me that critique of this movie is,0.033539224
like to quote-unquote white while that may be true to a certain extent that doesn't,0.08689228
necessarily like make it a bad thing but at the same time it just opens,0.02413619
my eyes to the fact that there is such a lack of coming-of-age movies and,0.10705266
centered on a person of colors experience and especially a young round or black girls,0.073987715
coming-of-age experience I hope by me pointing this out there it's not till start a,0.08091427
hate train on this movie I think this movie is so funny it's so great,0.29253805
I genuinely feel like this movie has the potential to be one of those generation-defining,0.033470046
movies of its time like you know when we look back on the 80s people,0.057348143
think of like what was that iconic teen movie of the 80s it was The,0.05339695
Breakfast Club 90s you have clueless you also had Dazed and Confused coming out of,0.08353243
the 90s even though that portrayed the high school experience in the 70s and then,0.018614499
the 2000s you have like Mean Girls and super bad those are iconic teen comedy,0.34107366
movies that really are classics of its genre and I feel like in 10-15 years,0.014968627
time when people are like oh what was it like to be a teenager in,0.036356278
2019 there reference book smart like I feel like that's how good this movie is,0.029975835
but at the same token I hope within the next couple of years that there,0.015872613
are going to be other movies that will portray a diverse range of coming-of-age experiences,0.026012007
for people of color because especially given the climate of 2019 since Hollywood is claiming,0.088587165
to be all about diversity I hope that those movies are actually going to be,0.043441813
made and I feel like all of the brown black kids growing up in 2019,0.3690486
deserve their own coming-of-age movies as well well that's about it for this video if,0.1790069
