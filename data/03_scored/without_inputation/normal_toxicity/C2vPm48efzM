oh no Martin Scorsese film all right we're finally here without a word by been,0.108770356
booming said ello Rubicon that's right was insane here and we are here for another,0.15899761
Bowman review for finally a new Martin Scorsese film the Irishman which is on Netflix,0.09770122
not that you can actually go stream which is a three-hour and plus epic which,0.10950881
of course stars none other than Robert DeNiro John pesky and Al Pacino or cappuccino,0.14123933
whatever a jack-and-jill but mostly focusing on the story of these men here from Frank,0.234793
Jimmy and Russel Frank of course who just won from you know Dublin truck scene,0.0965315
they're just doing simple jobs that aren't working for the mobster and working on the,0.26368353
Russell and we get to see through the life a perspective of him tours commentary,0.10093604
alongside these gentlemen in this very long epic film here the irishman martin scorsese one,0.19126332
of the most legendary iconic filmmakers we have of our error not the guy that,0.11760347
you've been hearing Trent for months about his comments of MCU films a man that,0.191776
has established himself as one of the most innovative and most assertive directors in the,0.04393128
style of form of what he has brought behind the genre of just suspense of,0.090486825
either his dark comedy of flushes at times but mostly films like this upon his,0.26457754
mops in themes of such a if you compare it to Goodfellas which this film,0.31089434
is inevitable to compare and I can truly say that as far as foams like,0.08174292
this and it's kind of a great highlight moment for Netflix to kind of get,0.044073336
someone of a caliber of what Scorsese as what was having this first time of,0.092710964
this trio of robber and Joe coming out of retirement and Al Pacino on the,0.39492303
phone together because obviously the last time we had a such of Robert and Al,0.051847994
Pacino collab right just killer I wouldn't say it was one of the best of,0.24105842
moments probably blood that we got this year but a long side award season and,0.07729354
alongside the fact that with a lot that comes into play with a film like,0.07907273
this would easily be the biggest budget that Martinus at the helm as well as,0.08846547
it obviously being the long epic that it is which passes endgame is the longest,0.094669946
moment of 2019 it is understandable for those that don't really go on the weekly,0.0781386
basis of us you know certainly themselves to kind of in do the movie experience,0.07612183
and sitting through it that maybe something like this could seem a bit long to,0.10925879
them and maybe you might have to separate this into such a series breakdown after,0.09718445
breakdown I'm just the people that I look from the perspective of how people can,0.11556984
sit an entire day and stream a TV show or an entire season but they,0.05469136
can't sit through just a 3-hour movie maybe that's just me you of course I,0.09617583
Robbie Robertson of course is the long collaborator for Martin Scorsese returning after decades of,0.0904669
collaborating and it only makes sense that for him to come in this project because,0.0661432
really who is the helm this this long tail of of just mobsters and just,0.4032928
being through the perspective of these gentlemen through thick and thin and through almost every,0.09132401
single horrible moment here but obviously with a Scorsese film with the hype around it,0.29052806
and with the cast around it I mean it's a big film and it's a,0.11471347
film that it will take all of its criticisms and all of its indulging opinions,0.15329336
because it Scorsese can give it opinion just like all the rest of our movie,0.07141077
goers why not for his own film right which is fine for me because it's,0.11223341
not like in the sense that Scorsese is trying to redefine himself or anything even,0.112105
though every film he establishes just what makes him stands out was such of a,0.0923455
character but you know there really is such a traditional filmmaking here that really goes,0.050525557
beyond a lot of the things that really kind of occupy when it comes to,0.053878065
the storytelling and really a lot of the foreshadowing that Scorsese is very obsessed with,0.068124965
you got a lot of the panning shots a lot of the visual images you,0.28031307
have so much of kind of these creative spaces that really kind of set the,0.055938434
environment and set the tone for a lot of the characters that Scorsese portrays a,0.030330833
narrative cinema that really Martin the captures upon just the setting of New York and,0.053021017
obviously with the way that everything captures from every street angle from every side angle,0.084910505
of people having a conversation inside of a club or having inside of a building,0.23793314
or through a car there's just so many translations through the weight of the camera,0.087982036
base its itself and bounces from character to character that it's almost as if you,0.08121649
know Martin is obsessed to make sure that you get every Satur perspective here especially,0.08612843
that the interesting part of the dialogue engage here is that if those were reformed,0.033040397
at all you know you look at characters that bounce off each other like one,0.15343161
will be the messenger to another and it's just always so intriguing because it builds,0.057837877
so much of the intensity because wow they try to flip you off of really,0.14883356
trying to base it off just at any moment knowing that anything can happen with,0.06467391
of course the dangers of the actions that are taking place here it's always from,0.07986979
the perspective of the characters and I think Martin is very not focused highly on,0.07618988
trying to make you have to choose who you need to like or not it's,0.11348616
more so that these are the characters these are their vulnerabilities and it's for you,0.08297829
to kind of take it to the chin of this is really the setting of,0.06047904
what it is and not even just talking from the background but even from the,0.08070547
sense of like the collar look and a lot of the things that very come,0.06773571
tight upon just how Martin wants everything aligned with each other there is so much,0.13198924
gristle to detail that is just something that for him it's just as a visionary,0.072894365
you have to capture things quickly in your head than almost even the writers do,0.23911272
and it's something that it all just occupies a lot behind the camera and there's,0.078401364
just so much here that grandpa did so is this three hour film that everything,0.13843945
just gets so much upon Martin's advantage from the budget to the way that this,0.071052276
film takes so much of its time yeah of course from behind the costume design,0.086059004
Christopher Peterson as well as sandy Power who did work for the favorite and Mary,0.09663365
Poppins returns and they do and glorious job here with the design here I mean,0.052473772
Lord talking from the pantsuits the dessous jackets to the highlighting of the clothing here,0.07429
I mean everything is so non high-profile it's not too too flashy but it's just,0.090680644
nothing the crisp of making the characters just feel very real upon their presentation like,0.07480602
there are even moments that they play with the humor in this film of you,0.11437272
know a character walking in with a Gucci fit there's someone just coming in with,0.11550918
a suit that it's very transformative to an argument that it displays so well from,0.15571131
just the way that they can make everything speak in language that it's a tremendous,0.062407624
job here and also from going back to the score of Robbie Robertson's idea of,0.110315606
really the score here not being again to too traditional but there's ways that he,0.14060323
use a lot of the acoustic form and a lot of the trembling ways to,0.0701759
the score that really kind of sneaks up on that it builds this very crisp,0.101578
tone that doesn't feel very overblown it doesn't put overdramatic for a film that is,0.10398794
a drama it really kind of sets home melodies here they are just very touching,0.16680506
upon the way that it just grabs so much of the moments that it doesn't,0.09491875
overpower a lot of other people in the room other voices it's like it just,0.11860007
hollows in as if like everything is moving in slow motion and it's just something,0.08658413
that is just really capturing it just really shows why the chemistry between him and,0.056669332
Martin is just so dynamic when they do films together now obviously with this being,0.13679945
a film this long and obviously needing your characters to carry the acting is obviously,0.110629804
the very big front center of this film here and with such including myself that,0.0554405
a duty years been critical for such a Robert in the not Pacino films like,0.10259113
this really kind of showed that man when they focus up it really kind of,0.09241684
shows for the better because while Robertson the order this might not be one of,0.109095976
my favorite performances from him and he's pretty solid in the film and Joe pesky,0.09495709
of course who is not as very animated as he usually is you know he's,0.20180748
someone that is very you know he's very constructive on his very humid and very,0.13281976
fast pace of speaking it's something he was really great and good fellows it's really,0.07398793
out Pacino that shines here and he shines in a way that is just an,0.06834123
advantage of of what he does so bets is that not only in the sense,0.098959714
of being eminent and animated but he just finds ways to take the situation and,0.077634834
a bunch of men in the room and he can extend one little piece of,0.22240533
dialogue and make it just feel just so brutal but just also makes it hit,0.17745979
in such a douchey way that it just gives the character so much to see,0.07444103
him as like a friend that you can probably relate to in real life of,0.054783728
someone that you just cannot control it doesn't matter how much you advise this man,0.31089434
he is just so relentless and opportun I was so relentless in this film that,0.21092623
you're just like what are you doing it's so dangerous but it's so addicting and,0.39933485
it goes a lot of credit to even the way that he'll even cut himself,0.39562264
off like he wants to finish the sentence but he's so pissed that he can't,0.43011573
get it out and this was very performative to kind of the method of what,0.13228522
he does with his acting that it's really you know constructive here and it does,0.071500584
a lot to really kind of bring in the emotion of the scene even at,0.06103989
the aging factor of how we can get props so it's not as addictive as,0.10210678
you would fear to be meaning that it's too distracting dark moments that the center,0.15192951
part of where the camera angle is very close up that you can tell that,0.06712546
robber has this thing looked at how we kind of holds its form he's very,0.2561774
good at it it's what he's always been good at with the meat the films,0.18628359
I do think there are moments with his eye touches that they could have fixed,0.07187616
that a bit it's a bit too much as like a robot look but other,0.15449405
than that I do think for a moment for the most part they did a,0.051019933
really good job kind of capturing it obviously maybe not for makeup deform in a,0.08922557
sense maybe so but obviously well whatever they had to use to kind of make,0.070599556
that technology work I think over the plate in their favor and obviously this being,0.12482138
based on the book I heard you paint houses and weather patches of this could,0.031503152
be true or not because these films being as long as it is there's not,0.18951878
a lot that they could capture realistically and those debates about that for sure maybe,0.054360613
some reviews that you could be arguable or not in the sense of how realistic,0.15630132
that the kind of capture the film I think mostly Martin kind of focus again,0.07077463
on the detail of really kind of the delicacy of the emotions of seeing these,0.09348202
men and seeing how the bond kind of gets created and how decisions have to,0.1664805
get made whether you agree or disagree because a lot of the forward-thinking here goes,0.0995985
up on play of the way things get constructed or set up or the reasoning,0.08097577
of why certain moves have to get made you know there are so much upon,0.08607913
the blocks and a lot of the set pieces that really kind of play upon,0.10100022
the violence atmosphere as well but I think Martin kind of showed it from the,0.18263058
angle of what how he sees it that it happens so bluntly it happened so,0.06163336
quick it's not glorified it's not anything to be pretty it's just really brutal and,0.13801077
I think this film is a very you know very dark and very cold feel,0.076271564
to it that I think really kind of leaves it to stir and then you,0.14952812
can't think about it too long because then things are just moving forward because what,0.053162158
the themes here of films that Martin is done before the doesn't come very far,0.13085893
away from territory such as fighting a family of loyalty or respect there's a lot,0.10032686
of the grounds of what the gentlemen in this film here come upon front and,0.097039714
center of matter that people approach each other as men like the way people talk,0.15455046
to each other in this film they wanted front and center they do not want,0.09470966
to be in the background like even though it may seem egotistical at times I,0.3036749
think these characters understand that there's a lot more that bears upon what's to come,0.0850143
to lose that for them it's like if you're gonna address me address me and,0.23482133
that's what also comes with the character of a Frank where I think you see,0.045221336
it from his perspective because everything that comes upon a sense of none of this,0.14911912
lifestyle to be hydrolyzed is that the floatie of his character is the fact that,0.061555833
his own ego comes from whether he has the respect of someone else of migration,0.29187015
there's other people that you don't admire as well from their vulnerability of his constant,0.20462374
actions that I think really kind of tours apart kind of the subtleties of really,0.0867544
kind of his language speaking from his daughters to the way that residents for the,0.092427246
love of his wife that you see from the love of his brothers that it,0.16096653
comes so much impact to the way that people really want to sit and tell,0.0970773
you how these moments should have been like this but I think Martin kind of,0.11600859
understands that not everybody can kind of approach it the same family is not always,0.053425424
bright and smiley a lot of things come really not even in a sense of,0.15421875
bitterness and kind of you know distress it you know there are people that you,0.23396447
trust and there's just people that you know have a genuine feel to what they're,0.07155438
approaching you with yes that just kind of wanted like much into your life that,0.18129505
you don't really want that and I do like the idea of the way that,0.10793828
the kids and really kind of the daughters are viewed in this film bed it's,0.18497121
leveled in the sense that they're not in the background just to be in the,0.1054027
background they have human hearts too and sometimes they give that look that but sometimes,0.14143156
if directors can do it very lightly they just really show a way that really,0.053696267
it can kind of bring you in and are you just seeing these two people,0.09659333
facing each other and you can't turn away no matter how much Frank thinks that,0.105408356
he's owing this family and is giving them a lifestyle that they can avoid there's,0.09514071
nothing to avoid because they are a part of this this is something that they,0.10091913
have to live with and they can't just move like regular people or defend themselves,0.120492175
knowing that someone like this wants to be attached to everybody it's very threatening and,0.16218427
it's something that I think really kind of humanizes the characters in a way that,0.14812277
Martin really does very poetically even the comedy in this film the way that things,0.105270125
are depicted that really for something I find it you know hilarious I find it,0.08421771
in a dark sense you could look at the search of like the corner store,0.084814794
scene where Robert is coming in full like aggression mode or you look at even,0.12750877
the moment when of course the Jo scene involving ice cream they may feel improper,0.074621744
even the moment as well where we have guys discussing the smell of fish like,0.15996505
I don't know how a scene involving the mentioning of fish could be so hilarious,0.1021024
but it is if for me gripes with the film and it's not even really,0.05522191
involving the pace or even like the length of the film I think for me,0.070137486
it always comes from the grasp of moments where I think obviously this is a,0.0691897
very perspective film and there's a lot that you have to take in what some,0.10617117
times gonna be a bit too much and I do think it's understandable because that's,0.149533
really for anyone to kind of interpret upon that with your interest of these characters,0.082074426
but I do think there's a lot more moments that while we settle with these,0.06587692
main main characters there's a lot other characters that I wish that could have got,0.02376549
a lot more shine that could have gave a real sense of like everybody being,0.1163532
part of the experience you know while you get these set of conversations I think,0.08173771
besides Frank given the comments or it would have been really nice to kind of,0.06431727
give others that sounded the perspective as well there's also moments where I do think,0.059958614
sometimes this film it definitely feels very big and I think for its own good,0.11444117
Wow it definitely has a lot to really kind of play with with obviously the,0.08341627
rector that's so great at what he does I do think there are moments I,0.1799
kind of wish this film could really took its own time and in the sense,0.06380233
of that with it being so fast because it's around for film you already have,0.09838115
enough to spare upon your runtime and I wish it kind of took a lot,0.3950796
more moments to really kind of breathe in emotionally because sometimes it does kind of,0.09740812
feel like without the violent moments without a lot of the bitter and more very,0.1292334
more petty moments with a lot of the conversations that in dude I think you,0.18685554
motion 'le this phone could have definitely had its own moments to really kind of,0.053202044
spew in and not feel cliche because morons never really been about the cliche but,0.8129212
I think it would have been nice to kind of see the people that factored,0.18463965
in this life very heavily to kind of get their own moments as well because,0.09251303
I do think wow the Irishman does feel like a very big epic film and,0.115507625
really kind of showcases a lot of what makes Martin the best of what he,0.08099371
does with this genre I do think that our moments that it takes me out,0.09652452
because sometimes I do feel like the film is running too long in one perspective,0.06170517
that it just doesn't hit and resonate as much as visually what's captured because visually,0.07046104
there's a lot that really stands out upon the storytelling but I think verbally as,0.09422027
you kind of get used to it too much that it does kind of feel,0.17906524
like a parent that's kind of speaking to you repeatedly I also will say as,0.093536995
well that even though the ending the closing shot is great I definitely think it,0.3240337
kind of sinks in a lot of from the perspective of Frank I do think,0.10759591
that ending takes a bit too long upon reach it really stretches out for about,0.14044942
a 15 20 minute stretch and even though again I have no problem with the,0.03394551
runtime I do think kind of the pace is where for me it kind of,0.0602361
really kind of triggers but I think overall the irishman is still enjoyable it may,0.29391286
not be one of my favorites from Scorsese but I do think it is an,0.088505454
experience especially for a Netflix film it offers a lot the performances are pretty solid,0.034714945
but I definitely think Al Pacino was a huge standout here also wouldn't give a,0.06736732
shot at the Bobby Cannavale and of course there's a Clements who appear in here,0.4433216
it was great to see them and also special appearance from that rapper that was,0.078482084
great overall the Irishman is on Netflix it's three hours and 20-some minutes I would,0.1115915
say give it a shot if you're a movie goer because it's more on Scorsese,0.31350586
alone and whether you like it or not I still respect the fact that he's,0.17852752
one of the bolder filmmakers we still have and for a man that is that,0.08806427
the pace of where he's at in life he is truly making the films he,0.14965056
wants to make and I give that credit to him at Quentin Tarantino that they,0.055836327
are truly showing that they can go by their own pace and that's something you,0.09557067
have to respect and I I definitely respect them for that direction here I'm still,0.061220683
good for them uh yeah I'm out of breath whoo writing something but the montre,0.24189657
tomato saying the Irishman for me gives basic seven to the Irishman what were your,0.23804596
