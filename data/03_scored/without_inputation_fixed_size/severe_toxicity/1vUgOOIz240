Katelyn Deaver stars in book-smart where she does her best to break out of her,0.13372253
character as smart and responsible Eve Baxter by playing somebody who is smart and responsible,0.024968334
except with a terrible mouth its Olivia Wilde's feature-length directorial debut so how does she,0.21324924
do with this high school drama tea so it's the day before graduation and the,0.025153255
two top students in the school who happen to be best friends realize that they,0.021722902
have missed out on all kinds of parties and really just high school social life,0.053285867
because they focused so much on their schoolwork in order to get into the top,0.06396007
schools then they realize though that their friends well their acquaintances their classmates who did,0.02977362
party who did have a lot of high school experiences also got into those exact,0.024828644
same top schools so they set out on the night before graduation to find an,0.01030303
epic party so that they can kind of cram all of these experiences into one,0.0526892
night before they graduate all of the characters seem to be kind of caricatures of,0.032915283
real-life I mean they are all just taken kind of to the extreme and really,0.12598379
exaggerated I mean like the jock is all jock the skater is kind of just,0.13216734
dumb and brainless and a little bit clueless the the stoner is well there's stoned,0.64384663
out of their minds and even the gay guys are just wildly an overly flamboyant,0.47580227
and just it was a little off-putting to see all of these characters who are,0.02667586
just such extremes of anything based in reality I mean yes you do have all,0.041174866
of these people on all of those as examples in real life but typically you,0.06989018
don't have all of them to such a degree in one small little microcosm so,0.051187214
to see them all put into that situation it did feel just a little bit,0.103273086
forced like it didn't feel or ring true so along with Kaitlyn Dever we have,0.02937584
beanie Feldstein and together they're kind of good I mean they they for the most,0.06127805
part bring out the best in each other I mean they really work hard as,0.08162469
best friends to complement each other to lift each other up and I appreciated that,0.03055255
a lot but on the other hand they're also super crude together and that began,0.02185727
to really great on me just it it became wildly unnecessary and like that they,0.10174649
were just trying to be crude for Croods sake now I'm not a prude or,0.13355623
even disillusioned that there aren't crude people out there and that that's not how real,0.040299486
life is however in this scenario it felt forced it felt almost like that's how,0.023117792
it should be that everybody should be crude or that they should be acting like,0.035245422
this versus it kind of being in the minority I mean I volunteer with middle,0.06784142
schoolers and high schoolers and for the most part they don't act this way I,0.06265032
mean sure there are some that do and and we all have our periods of,0.014069964
you know acting out or whatever but this in this instance in the film it,0.035331894
just it felt like it was trying to tell us no no this is how,0.022960143
you're supposed to be versus hey that's kind of an anomaly or a little blip,0.09918154
on the screen the pace of the film is is pretty good I mean it,0.026816878
moves along and it keeps the story going for the most part right up until,0.017379252
about the beginning of the third act and then it just kind of steps on,0.03279156
the brakes for a minute and it slows way down and then after that it,0.034705956
picks back up again so you know I had a minor pacing issue there just,0.021362374
because you start to feel the time just a tiny bit but for the most,0.06594098
part throughout the film you don't notice the time moving along I like some of,0.024597825
the interactions between the characters and I also really like that some of the assumptions,0.027571863
that are placed on the characters at the beginning of the film or that we,0.0101221
are told to have assumptions as an audience they turn out to be wrong and,0.024774099
then also that we see growth in some of the characters I really like that,0.0133342715
I really appreciate that fact because have the characters all stayed flat throughout the entire,0.022679437
thing then it's just kind of pointless I mean there's no reason to watch because,0.08227989
it's just you're just watching a day in the life of somebody where they don't,0.083233096
learn anything and to me that's just kind of a waste of time but they,0.19205914
thankfully didn't do that with all of the characters I mean you actually saw growth,0.034872252
you saw change you saw repentance or remorse or just you know them working on,0.050301187
relationships and that was awesome there are some genuinely funny moments in the film and,0.012667757
some parts where I laughed out loud but I think they're kind of few and,0.076303884
far between that most of the time when there was humor sometimes it felt forced,0.019502519
or it just wasn't funny well you can probably get a little bit of enjoyment,0.09281973
from book-smart I don't think it's memorable and it's certainly not that funny and really,0.02544527
I don't think it's worth the time or the money certainly to rush right out,0.025040174
and just drop all of your cash on it in the theater check it out,0.049580127
on Netflix wait for it for red box absolutely because then you're not out a,0.053407595
ton of cash I mean there are some redeeming points in the movie but overall,0.032438345
it was just kind of there there's no violence but there is sex nudity and,0.29811728
a ton of profanity I give book-smart two and a half out of five couches,0.110358626
