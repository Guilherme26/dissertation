Wow I I knew that Logan was going to be brutal I hoped it would,0.11505254
be brutal but I was not prepared that the deepest cuts would be emotional I,0.08399404
mean this is a tour-de-force they swear a lot in the movie I mean it's,0.10268664
earned it fits but boy there's a lot of swearing in here so I say,0.10151134
with the utmost respect this is a tour de force for Hugh Jackman Patrick Stewart,0.08962122
and James Mangold and congrats non-callable greeters you finally get to meet Wolverine this is,0.07137807
the first time that I've seen a comic book character accurately portrayed on the silver,0.08156697
screen as they are in the comics like wasting special things done with comic book,0.14945719
characters on the big screen before but never have I watched a movie and said,0.06529435
I feel like I'm reading one of those comic book stories I had that feeling,0.05875575
a little bit with the first Avengers but that's a whole different type of story,0.081649736
Wolverine comics tend to be a little bit a little more drama a little more,0.31089434
storing them you know it's not like 90% fighting so to have that transposed to,0.13777004
the big screen is incredibly satisfying and also for all of you who like to,0.2416572
still write up comic books as well as the funny pages right or like a,0.18854621
lesser form of storytelling well I'm telling you this is what this is what we're,0.13334537
reading you're getting it right here and this is from the very first scene the,0.062087853
first scene I felt like again I was reading a Wolverine story it was perfect,0.08427098
on every level and that of course includes the fighting it was a thrill to,0.06163591
finally see a Wolverine fight done correctly brought to life on the big screen it,0.09088542
was just as magical as I'd hoped it would be I was like that's exactly,0.066642605
how he would do it and it wasn't overly gory I mean it was just,0.09428346
it was just right you know like they didn't err on the side of caution,0.057724174
they didn't go for overt overkill uh but it looked like it hurt it looks,0.102530405
like I hurt everyone involved and I loved it and we're not just talking fight,0.2208218
choreography and visual effects here we're talking camerawork and also the score I thought the,0.05020741
music was used and ibly well here and they say Johnny Cash just for the,0.023955883
credits so the score here it's not just cheats with you know songs the score,0.15409003
is incredibly well done but you know what else is good no scripts I mean,0.15547976
it would have to be to be telling a Wolverine story the way I just,0.050562195
said but I think we have to talk about the script in its own special,0.05436904
section because that's very rare for comic book movies still unfortunately and had amazing one-liners,0.08198529
and had a did a great job exploring relationships but it also did a great,0.05765685
job and what it chose to leave unsaid both emotionally and in terms of story,0.11447118
points it's very sophisticated you know it asks you to fill in a lot of,0.08265069
the blanks but without directly asking you to do so you had to really pay,0.095470026
close attention I think and if that's one way that this movie will benefit from,0.06482154
repeat viewings I don't know how many recent doings it's going to get we're going,0.08080618
to talk about some of its very few flaws at the end of the reveal,0.069227345
this is no spoiler so so don't worry about that but I think on the,0.070531614
screenwriting front it's definitely worth at least one more visit to try and pick up,0.075707205
on some of the things that work I think even by the end of the,0.07847058
movie still not clarified which I which I thought was great I really liked that,0.095278256
choice I mean they need to be clarified you got the overall idea and you've,0.26444787
got the same idea that the characters were getting I think I was part of,0.05003458
the experience I think the magic ingredients in the script might be James Mangold because,0.053356554
the other team screenwriters is all due respect to them I mean they did contribute,0.115803294
to the script so yeh Ovid Scott Frank worked on the last Wolverine and Michael,0.04463681
Greene helped out with Green Lantern so I'm thinking that mangle is the one that,0.061682753
may use the special sauce here and it goes to show how important it is,0.042699203
who you hire to write these movies we've talked so much about the directors and,0.08640694
I think that the writer should be just as important to conversation not just amongst,0.15529151
us I mean of course we would take it seriously or I hope that the,0.08601916
studio executives would realise that as well particularly when you get results like this the,0.099159345
movie also to my surprise reminded me of a terminator movie t2 in particular but,0.10445387
not like hey you ripped off terminator but like hey here are two great movies,0.23957747
that have a surprising amount of overlap that had not I had not seen before,0.073125705
and this movie makes it very clear it also makes you miss Terminator movies I'd,0.0805795
also like to point out on that note that there are a lot of surprises,0.10497797
in store for you when you see this movie this year you know last year,0.08686942
was the year like did you show too much in the trailer and people have,0.062027797
been worried about this this year so far like cure for wellness they had like,0.06449304
a ton of stuff they didn't show here I was amazed at how much had,0.07488764
not been revealed about the movie and I was very very impressed with that so,0.056860097
beware spoilers and they're just really it's really great because some of you might be,0.18424314
like how is it like a tournament you'll see all right natural performance is Hugh,0.077784084
Jackman this has been his signature role for 17 years I can't believe he's been,0.06887287
playing this character for 17 years and with this movie he walks that down forever,0.08232371
this is forever his I was just it was so impressive he also made me,0.077129975
cry this movie made me cry a lot you'll want to have like tissues coming,0.18842916
out of your fists like Wolverines claws like like we're not talking like oh I'm,0.63475364
teary-eyed we're talking like a single tear down my cheek you know bottom line you,0.6387069
know I had - a 3d glasses I had my regular glasses on we watch,0.12396566
this in 2d and it was great just a single tear I was like oh,0.08456599
my god and then Patrick Stewart also made me cry the the subtleties and the,0.11211088
rawness of both their performances is something to behold indeed and there isn't a single,0.06517609
ounce of vanity in either of their performances and a lot of love the characters,0.08858248
they're playing this leader this is the antithesis of the paycheck gig and it was,0.0712214
so fabulous to be able to experience that that Boyd Holbrook he makes one heck,0.4031364
of an introduction for himself his first his first scene is one of the best,0.09245299
conversations in a movie that is full of great conversations like this is one of,0.06339591
those movies you know we talk about people fast forward from action sequence to action,0.07577375
sequence or this is a movie where you will stop for some of the conversations,0.11706523
as well and want to see them play out again they're just that good it's,0.08884038
so nice to have a good script it's such it was so wonderful but if,0.058085993
the film goes on the movie needs Boyd Holbrook's character less and less so he,0.07417877
kind of stayed since the background little bit that's for Daphne keen she knocks her,0.15315066
fighting scenes out of the park and she has a hundred and ten percent believable,0.078866236
as a baby Wolverine however she doesn't have Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's likability factor,0.21527949
part of that is built into the story and you'll see that when you watch,0.049475405
the movie but part of it unfortunately is just the actress and maybe what the,0.11977626
child is hard like what do we go out for do we go for someone,0.44884622
who can sell the fight scenes or we go for someone can sell the emotional,0.1495243
things and of course you go with the fight scene that's the most important in,0.091701046
a movie like this and even if she was a bit a little bit more,0.4031269
personable I think that the script doesn't give her a moment to call her own,0.09984494
outside of the action sequences anyway so I think that also hurts your character but,0.08147844
I felt I never really got to know x-23 but then also in addition to,0.05117352
that as far as flaws go Moises moves perfect absolutely perfect but the third act,0.13221131
I actually kind of resent the movie a little bit for the third act and,0.1305959
we'll talk about that in a spoiler review closer to when the film is released,0.048819255
because I don't want to give away spoilers but I'm talking I I resent the,0.087707154
choices that were made in the third act both story wise and also in terms,0.030275228
of message and I think speaking of message one problem this film is going to,0.10236598
potentially have is it's going to come across as being political now I don't know,0.09705683
if that's intentional or if it ended up being amped up more than they intended,0.06883785
by the way things have developed particularly here in the United States but I know,0.0638399
that there are certain things that are a problem there are like I'm a real,0.08499047
hot-button sensitive issue across the globe and this movie kind of taps into that let,0.11766673
me just say if the Budweiser Super Bowl commercial annoy you this movie is going,0.20535143
to make your head explode and so I feel kind of bad that because of,0.5515534
the third act choices that this movie makes in a number of areas it might,0.055286065
hurt the film's commercial prospects so I won't be curious to see how it does,0.07901076
at the box-office long-term you know it's going to be huge the first weekend I,0.053127375
do worry about repeat business word of mouth a little bit because of that particularly,0.18653312
in red states let's say all right all right well so finally this for most,0.052402813
part and this is the only thing that keeps us from being them being equal,0.11499298
but this is very very very close to the dark night in terms of quality,0.073222786
when it comes to comic book movies and while Marvel Studios formula has been incredibly,0.19608413
successful they should be a little bit nervous because now Fox is two for two,0.13893831
because what Fox are starting to do with their Marvel movies is awe-inspiring and it's,0.24007986
the kind of work that we hope to see with the genre the comic book,0.117383756
genre post Nolan but they didn't materialize and now it is materializing over at Fox,0.099611714
which is crazy when you think about it considering what they've had to go through,0.240969
but maybe that was part of the process but they have come out on on,0.066177055
the other end making movies of the quality just shy just shy of the quality,0.1337652
of the Dark Knight I'm not impressed so we will be discussing this for sure,0.061973613
more as you know in much more details to get closer to the film's release,0.021676194
but I'm so happy to tell you you should definitely buy your Logan tickets and,0.06988381
bring tissues alright alright your thought your thoughts down below if you have by any,0.31692895
chance seen the film do not spoil it for anyone uh and you can check,0.051953267
