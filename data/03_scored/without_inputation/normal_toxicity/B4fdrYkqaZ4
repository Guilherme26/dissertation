what's up guys,0.10309564
so book-smart is Olivia Wilde's directorial debut and it stars beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever as the two leaves of the film as they are seniors in high school,0.07589363
this is their day before graduation and they have been very responsible people and very responsible kids,0.14012007
and finally they say you know what we haven't lived our lives,0.1667648
we want a party tonight,0.029882377
and we actually want to see how you know it is to party because you know why not I think we deserve it,0.15913515
so that's the basic plot of the film going to this movie the trailers had me very excited to see it,0.09047205
I thought it actually looked very very funny and leaving the theater,0.07552529
I can say that book-smart is pretty much everything I hoped it would be this is a very solid comedy,0.15799963
it is very funny,0.0658581
I think Olivia Wilde's direction in this is great,0.11558146
I can't wait to see what she's gonna do,0.21627837
next,0.028648289
I think that the humor really works this is a really Rocchi comedy there's a lot of really raunchy humor in this,0.08379406
so you know if you're a fan of that it definitely does work and the chemistry between the two leads guys real quick,0.07152628
I do want to apologize I do not have soundproof walls and someone across the street happens to be cutting their grass,0.17198001
so I do apologize for that but the chemistry between beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever the two leads of the film,0.059580725
the chemistry is off the charts,0.07377751
I mean they are absolutely fantastic in this movie and I love you know sort of the first half of the movie I really thought it had a lot of Harold and Kumar vibes going on there,0.10013465
but the second half of the movie the film sort of takes a turn without,0.0628588
giving away any spoilers something sort of happens that leaves a certain series of events to unfold until the film wraps up and you know they are sort of questionable things that happen some sort of aunts consequential things that happen some very easy situations to get out of I guess you could say with about giving anything away also Billie lourd is in this film Carrie Fisher's daughter,0.077010505
I was actually very surprised about that because I didn't see her in any of the trailers,0.079721645
I had no idea she was in this movie until she popped up and I actually think that this might be her best performance she's ever giving she is a really funny actress in the Star Wars movies,0.13504928
she's very stoic you know,0.13144037
but in this film she really has the the chance to shine and really show what she could do,0.09525997
but her schtick you know the first time she has a bit,0.122898534
I guess you could say I was into it,0.06608934
the first maybe two times,0.048761602
but then all of a sudden her shtick started to get old for me,0.27088377
so I do like her performance but I feel like by the end of the film her character is just kind of very tired literally and not literally,0.070351616
I guess you could say but overall,0.0679478
I thought book-smart was a very solid comedy,0.20927493
this is probably the best comedy I've seen since blockers definitely also the best comedy I've seen since instant family,0.0673271
I was so I would say those are my two favorite comedies from last year and this your this film so far takes the cake and I'm gonna give book-smart four out of five stars,0.14002807
