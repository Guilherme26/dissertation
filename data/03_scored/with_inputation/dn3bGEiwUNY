a few thoughts that I wanted to say about the movie that couldn't really say,0.07053046
you know without spoiling the movie so if you haven't seen it and you don't,0.12052704
want spoilers stop the video now you did do whatever you have to do mute,0.4033506
it and just watch me talk like this alright whatever you have to do here,0.0986656
come the spoilers the main motivation was that you know Miguel found out that his,0.12004857
great great grandfather or he knew that his great great grandfather was a musician and,0.048719164
that that was that the music was in his blood and that's part of the,0.16870008
reason why he wanted to go on to be a musician himself now he thought,0.08101158
that this musician because of the guitar in the picture was a musician de la,0.08109552
Cruz who has who's the greatest singer in Mexican history in the movie he has,0.11032057
the signature guitar that actually the end of the guitar replicates one of the the,0.06769474
skulls that you know that we see you know on the faces of people during,0.36293495
the festivals of the Adela's Muertos and so he's like okay then the Cruz is,0.21078055
is my great-great grandfather I know I'm destined to do the music de la Cruz's,0.08231029
key phrase was you know go in and get your destiny I'm sorry I can't,0.09605759
remember exactly what he said but basically go out and get your destiny you know,0.101828136
go out and take your what's yours go out and chase your dreams and accomplish,0.42179528
them and Miguel lived by that now once he reaches the land of the dead,0.19747283
he goes in there because he stole you know guitar and when you steal from,0.41037098
the dead you end up transferring into that realm so he goes into that realm,0.31603524
looking for the looking for de la Cruz so that he could get his blessings,0.22445244
to be a musician back you know in on earth in the physical realm he,0.1214015
sees all that he sees his great great grandmother and he sees a lot of,0.14531662
the family that he had pictures of and they are like no no no there's,0.103451245
no way that we're gonna give you our blessings to be a musician no music,0.11184643
in our family okay so he meets a man named Hector Hector has been forgotten,0.24168482
by pretty much all of his family and he's just hoping that his daughter can,0.16355781
maintain his memory in that if he could get back just one time to the,0.06180619
physical world during the holiday to see his daughter that would make his world he'd,0.121632315
be able to you know disappear and go off into the unknown regions and be,0.5030501
happy so he meets up with Miguel and they make a deal you know okay,0.07677683
I'll help you find a la Cruz I know I'm if I help you find,0.14802876
a la Cruz you have to take this picture of me back to my daughter,0.39158213
so that she could remember me forever now Darren there's a twist in the in,0.08121834
the film where he realizes that and this was such a great twist in the,0.038069237
story great excellent writing to where Hector actually ends up being his father and the,0.0691989
reason why he never returned after he left you know his Hector's empty left Miguel,0.2695422
his great great grandmother that he was murdered by de la Cruz who was Miguel's,0.5154597
hero so Miguel thinks his great great grandfather who was his hero is a murderer,0.71184
who's not only a murderer but he's a faker he's a he's a total fraud,0.8060606
he's not actually the greatest musician he actually took all of these songs from Hector,0.17807327
he stole the songs from Hector and then murdered Hector so that he could take,0.5154597
these take this music and go off and become you know known as the greatest,0.11078258
singer in the world so at that point Miguel is totally crushed however once they,0.18918619
clarify the story he realizes that hold on Hector is the guy that left his,0.09661791
family and his daughter of course is Coco who of course is Miguel's great-great-great grandmother,0.24641705
and then he realized that Hector is his great great grandfather he ends up getting,0.08973152
you know the blessings of the entire family including his great-great grandmother they he gets,0.18177213
back to the physical world and this is the super touching part is gonna make,0.15371975
you cry tears of joy when Miguel starts playing remember me for his for his,0.32455105
great-grandmother Coco who's begins to remember her father who sang that to her when she,0.1516609
was just a young child just a young baby and she pulls out the picture,0.27328748
of him there it had his face torn off before she reattaches that portion and,0.5018946
now of course he'll be remembered ever we fast forward to the next year a,0.05645283
dia de los muertos and we see you know Hector and his wife and they're,0.44508052
all dancing together and happy and enjoying Tom and it was just a beautiful moment,0.04764827
made me drop a tear made the gentleman next to me he was crying everyone,0.22571455
in the theater is emotional and it's great I'm so happy you know that that,0.058611132
this film is doing so well especially from so much that I've heard from my,0.11623725
Mexican brothers and sisters you were right you steer me in the right direction this,0.16995108
was a great film one of the greatest picture our films of all time let,0.07118398
