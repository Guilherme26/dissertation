hello everybody welcome back to another movie reaction today we got another special one now this has been on the patreon poll for quite some time and it's always just barely missing it to being watched on the top two now this film is ladybird now this is something that i'm i'm really i'm really just like looking forward to because i've heard a lot of great things about it uh just in the regards of just the the story itself and the writing and i i'm just like excited as well as it being directed written and i'm trying to think of the other credit but it's produced by a probably like a woman as well too and you guys know how i feel about just people being misrepresented or just underrepresented in film uh in the film medium and i strive my best to shine a light on to those who are just not as highlighted usually in the film industry which is you know women and people of color and just other variations as well too just to list a few examples so it's really great when you have bodies of work whether good or bad just being made by people within that realm because it gives forth a whole new perspective an opportunity of storytelling and just different perspectives which i think is the key reasoning to making a film especially presenting it to an audience so i'm really excited to kind of look at this not only through fresh eyes me first first time watching this but also looking at it from a filmmaking perspective and also really acknowledging and you know getting an insight of why this film is great and what makes this film great and kind of like what i take out of this film and you know hopefully learn something new myself uh so i'm really excited about just the opportunity to learn and to educate and potentially help educate you guys as well too i'm really excited about that so guys like always if you want to see the full length because i do chop these up and a good bit is you know unfortunately taking out of the youtube edit definitely check out the full length below doing the you know through the patreon link if that's something that you're interested in but like always guys i'm going to stop talking let's get right into lady bird hey let's just sit with what we heard dang that dynamic shift is wow oh so now you're mad no it's because i'm ridiculous because you have a great moment i'm sorry i'm not perfect no one's asking you to be perfect just consider it would do i don't even want to go to school i love this already because i immediately noticed the dynamic shift barely be able to afford in-state tuition mother daughter mother-son relationship can kind of be like that you guys can be so emotionally attached and then be yelling at each other it all comes from a good place though my name is ladybird uh well actually it's not and it's ridiculous call me ladybird like you said you you should just go to city college you know with your work ethic just wow i love how the conversation like their dialogue is almost like overlapping one another i was i was not expecting that wow i don't think i've ever done that afraid that we will not get into the college of our choice we're afraid we won't be loved we won't be liked we won't succeed there are the classics i'm really interested in seeing how this film tackles the cliches of you know the life growing into the life sort of stories that we're kind of used to i mean like you know amazed and confused being an example of one i'm really interested in seeing how this film tells that story differently especially being in a different time era having a different protagonist with a different mindset different life it leaves for a lot of creativity in those areas do you know if sarah lawrence is actually in the city your parents would pay for that scholarships financial aid i'll figure it out my mom thinks i can't get in but she is sorely mistaken she already got a little bit about like her dream of going to like new york and you know i guess you could say places of like civilization i guess you could say where people feel as though their dreams are i guess they can't have pencils anymore there and they feel like they have to leave when in reality i mean it might have always been there i don't know i can relate to that because you know my experiences with even going to california myself maybe that could be saved for a video in itself a q a you guys let me know send them a note do you think that shelley and miguel have sex on the pullout couch oh yeah oh man that's great make your own [ __ ] eggs i wanted to you don't let me your sister doesn't like me i'm hungry [Music] that was great that entire scene was great for so many reasons i absolutely love that i believe it you guys know how much i love dinner scenes or just anything at the table there's so much personality that can be brought towards that and they did a phenomenal job just with that is that your given name yeah why is it in quote well i gave it to myself it's given to me by me okay i love the energy that is some great energy right there this is awesome i love her already oh man this dude is this dude came out with like all kinds of energy but she she's feeling them she's feeling him listen stop hey hi come here often excuse me i'm ladybug yo this is great i love the interactions here because i yeah i [Music] get our emotions going we're going to play i absolutely love how this film looks by the way it doesn't feel like a nostalgia because i don't think this was filmed in in film you know if i could use a correlation like dazed and confused feels nostalgic because it's film you know like it has that natural grain i think this feels like an emotion this feels like a dream because it's shot digitally but the greens and the blue hues of the shadows really give forth these incredible emotions it feels like a moment find the problems where you went wrong and work them out good job jules i could tell from your work you even understood the ones you missed yikes yikes you know when a teacher gives you a test face down that's never a good sign oh boy oh boy i still don't know how to use those rollers that you gave me oh oh man oh man the awkwardness is is so authentic ah there you go yo oh man i i oh this is great again like that's why i don't feel nostalgic over it it feels like a memory because i mean shoot i felt that way when i had my first kiss some of your friends fathers could employ your father and they're not going to do it if it looks like his family is trash wow wow dang it's so interesting how this story almost feels like it's being told by two different perspectives you know like you get little inputs of her story and then almost like the reality of the family specifically the mothers they pick up your feet i didn't know if you were talking about being passive aggressive you are so infuriated i'm not yelling oh it's perfect i love it oh man i love the writing in this i mean it really does showcase the duality of it like especially the mother and daughter relationship you know like again it's just all out of love even if it's weird in the duffel bag don't worry about it geez my grandmother will love that dress i think i think what i'm noticing too about the mother hence why she's so strict this is because yeah oh my god it's because she's me letting her daughter go you know like she's slowly coming to terms with that and i think that's her own way of coping with it i just hope it doesn't self-destruct her daughter you know and we have to kill his older brothers too [Music] oh boy oh boy that's oh no it's him it's the man it's dune guy let me stop playing there's never a line in the men's room oh oh okay all right all right wow i was not i was not expecting that now i'm pretty sure dune guy now is going to be uh an open option do you need money for the applications i can help with that no no i've got that summer jobs covered it this is why we have computer shut-off time this is our room okay okay just can you drive me to the post office nj it should still be open three two one [Music] [Applause] sure see you at the deuce hey i'm not paying you to flirt i wasn't flirting she had been this dude is too he is too cool man i was never that cool i mean i kept to myself when i was younger but like i don't know i looked like something else i think i think i think the universe above for this glow up now cause oh man all right let's have everyone take a knee huh what cozy sit now i know you all miss father devayed i can tell you that the brothers oh my goodness is the coach the the director of the play is that why he said take a knee yeah that's great i love that that's dope i've assigned a number to each of your roles and i'm gonna put the blocking up here on the board and then if you guys can transcribe that back into your playbooks that'd be great oh this is great that's a beautiful flip on like the cliche of the gym coach always teaching jim oh this is great this is comedy i love this let's juice it up okay guys now look roll one right you're gonna run kind of a skinny post right up front i want you to look straight at the audience oh dude this guy's great i love him this entire scene is just this is great [ __ ] him don't worry i'm not going to snitch on you well i hope not because i'd [ __ ] kill your family oh this is so great a little bit of time to figure out how i'm going to tell my mom and dad don't worry hmm wow wow that's wow i'm wow that's really that's that was really well done man [Music] wow i absolutely love that that was really well done that was good [Music] anything and everything he's like sasuke holy crap he's like never industrially produced is he sasuke guy now oh my goodness [Music] [Laughter] you live in sacramento i love it here i want to send my daughters to immaculate heart i also love that like the people that she's meeting like they're not like cliche evil you know like in other movies this girl right here would be like completely evil you know i think she's just like plus three times like it feels like it's just another friendship that was kind of made and whether if it's good or bad it is but she isn't inherently evil yeah well you know your mom's tits they're fake totally fake she made one bad decision at 19. two bad decisions and at 15 wow she actually made an interesting point about just like lady bird always kind of like wanting attention as well too cause low-key she always does want attention me a number for how much it costs to raise me and i'm gonna get older and make a lot of money and write you a check for what i owe you so that i never have to speak to you again wow oh wow jeez man that was that was rough i'm just happy i didn't lose my virginity to you yeah i was about to say i was about to say i don't yeah he never he never said that i was on top who the [ __ ] is on top their first time you mean like awareness of how many civilians we've killed since the invasion in iraq started what's this sweater oh man that moment is just uh man shout out to the moms out there my goodness what a what a role [Music] again i gotta shout out how much i love the compositioning of this camera and most importantly the color grading of this film i think it's it's it's perfect for this i i absolutely love it i feel like it's the perfect color grade for this film because of just how it's capturing the moments in our life sure i guess i pay attention don't you think maybe they are the same thing love and attention yes and that's what i was talking about like that's what i was feeling like what was like almost like the theme of this movie is like this is our last one when people you know pay attention to her when she pays attention to things it's like it's like love and i think that's why the mother and daughter relationship is just so like that is like the perfection of love because it's not perfect but there's a tension involved and i think that creates perseverance you know like love isn't like perfect or anything but it perseveres too tight and i and i think that's the theme of the mother and daughter's relationship i'm so happy she said that i think she's weird she is weird hey guys i guess i'll just sit shotgun man really did just like wait in the car though that's that's uh come on now that's too sasuke for me [ __ ] hate this song i love it thank you thank you please it's so interesting because other than like there'd be moments where she would stick by herself and then she would not can you take me to my friend julie's house please and i'm just so happy she's embracing it now um oh man this this is great this is a really damn good film this is a really damn good film i feel like with dazed and confused it captured an era this film captures a moment and freeze all faults as you from crimes would pardon to be let your indulgence set me free [Music] you yo that is the man i uh i love his character it's so good man it is so good sorry i know i can lie and not be a good person but please mom please i'm so sorry i didn't mean to i'm noticing how she's not giving her any attention all those memories man it really does feel like i've i've just entered her life it's so good and it's just so beautifully executed man seriously the power of film making well done dang you gotta learn how to let go like i said it's so self-destructive if you become like that i can't imagine how rough it must be but like you gotta be able to see your daughter off to college at least you know like come on [Music] turn around turn around turn around you're almost there come on it's okay should be back man geez i'm happy she came back though i really am that was a well done shot hey mom did you feel emotional the first time that you drove in sacramento um oh man i'm getting chills i'm getting a whole lot of chills right here right in the heart [Music] yep you you start really paying attention to things when you leave it and then when you come back and the whole theme of paying attention and loving and how those relate with one another i love you it's beautifully told and that is ladybird wow that was a phenomenal film guys all right everybody and we just got done watching ladybird man oh man this film was just yeah this is a great one this is this is definitely a good one this was it's so interesting watching all of these films that pertain to you know nostalgia and you know referring back to an era or a dream a moment and just watching how the stories that are being told are showcased through the filmmaking and man like lady bird did just a phenomenal job telling a story about a moment and a girl's life and just her womanhood as she grew more into herself and it did it in such a way that wasn't it took all the cliches and it it it it almost authenticated it i don't even know if that's even a word but that's what i'm feeling it feels like they just basically got all these cliches and they were like this is how we make them real to this person so they can be relatable to you know to those who experience this and i feel like this is one of those films where you know it could easily be a hit or miss because of just how personal it can be and i mean that with all praise because it definitely hit with me because i know even though i am a guy i feel as though the experiences that she went through with christine lady bird went through um you know the themes of it are very real to my childhood and my evolution as who i am now and what i'm probably going to be in the future and i can relate very heavily to those themes because the theme is love the theme is growth and you know growing through these uncertainties and realizing that not everything is as pictured perfect and as hollywood as the stories would like you to think that they are but in fact they are more textured and more unknown and i love that ladybird explored those those moments and i i'm just so happy that it was you know created by a woman you know like this by all the terms was yeah it's it's just it's just great because i love seeing stories of different types and it just makes me happy seeing more opportunities in film that are told by people who usually don't get that opportunity and i think this is just one of the many reasons that are out there in terms of why it is important no matter where you are or whatever you're going through to tell your story no matter what the case may be you know it's it's a beautiful thing and you could really be helping other people doing it so i just want to say thank you to the director and to all the people who laid hands on this film and for those patreon people who recommended me this um this was this was a really good film i really enjoyed watching this so if you guys want to check
