but generally speaking the music as a whole was a great ensemble of music the music was as warm as the tone and theme of the movie which really is in the words of the great Vin Diesel daily this movie is all about family and the love and flaws of a family every family has flaws,0.0858387
every family has absurdities that you're like that doesn't need to be there doesn't mean the family itself is bad such flaws are paved with good intentions but they should be addressed and assessed that maybe you don't need to do that it's just a good look at family,0.108568795
