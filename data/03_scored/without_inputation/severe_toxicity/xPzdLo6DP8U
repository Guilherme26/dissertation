doesn't know she only has a few weeks to live so is this smaller flick,0.106644236
one of 2019 must-see let's find out but before I get into my thoughts let,0.08383376
me know what you guys thought of the farewell and if you thought this was,0.021277228
as delightful as I did now let's get into some of the good so the,0.077879705
farewell I had been hearing a lot of buzz from other critics obviously one of,0.021430887
my good buddy said that this was a great movie to go check out and,0.04820719
I gotta say I could not be happier to have went out of my way,0.07844111
to the local art house theater across town and check this one out this movie,0.02678761
if I had to give one word to the farewell it would be delightful director,0.021851283
Lulu Wang and the cast and everyone involved took this based on a true life,0.06218203
story and framed it in such a positive manner because looking from the outside in,0.023259476
this is a heartbreaking story you know the through line it's gonna be grief and,0.022839746
sadness and I'm not gonna deny those aspects are here in the farewell but the,0.018994983
way that they frame everything and the way that it's structured it's more of kind,0.032943886
of joy and happiness and celebrating someone's life then focusing on the bad and that's,0.11155462
what I think I just loved about the farewell was that they kind of put,0.037157822
this positive spin on everything rather than you know dark dreary the end of days,0.05428763
type thing and I think that that's why I thoroughly enjoyed the farewell because it,0.035685774
exposed us to traditions and cultures that personally I'm not too familiar with we don't,0.026293378
see them on the big screen that much and it felt like a refreshing watch,0.058191597
from the family dinners and discussions to the wedding ceremony and then obviously at the,0.011715215
core of this movie the the way that the Chinese people handle cancer you know,0.3728623
instead of letting the person know they kind of let the whole family know don't,0.028077401
tell that person so then they can continue living essentially a normal life like nothing,0.16366976
is dragging them down because they think that the idea of cancer is what actually,0.10383051
kills you rather than the cancer maybe I'm paraphrasing but that's essentially the lesson or,0.5218773
the theme in this farewell movie and I'm sure you're probably thinking I mean personally,0.040881522
I even thought it's a little bit dumb but you know it works and the,0.31495565
way that I mentioned that it's kind of this light-hearted fun manner is because you,0.035561383
can only imagine the shenanigans the lies what they have to do to keep the,0.073319204
charade going so this gram of theirs they're their agent grandma does not understand or,0.10713781
figure out what's going on and it is like I said a lot of the,0.042198583
humor is derived from this stuff along with the performances and the family aspect at,0.010279748
the middle of it again I didn't think I was gonna be laughing out loud,0.027974298
I got more joy than sadness from this movie because the way everything again the,0.019568373
way everything was structured you know the performances all the way from Aquafina to Han,0.05776322
Xin I think it is each of them turns in a solid performance and I,0.19858858
entirely buy into this family dynamic because you know they're sitting there having dinner you,0.03640151
know each of them are kind of laughing bickering know maybe mean a little sarcastic,0.115987405
here or there and there are also the two dads who are brothers who hadn't,0.029188259
seen each other in years they get back together it doesn't seem like a day,0.04671651
has passed and that's why the farewell worked so well for me because it's not,0.012021864
just this one aspect you know this aging person that's dying from cancer it's sort,0.14494085
of this family drama also making myself think about my family like I don't know,0.04615709
how long some people in my family have I haven't seen an extended family for,0.033062954
years I need to get together sit down just have a big dinner and start,0.035895307
to I guess enjoy or cherish or celebrate someone's life again I thought the farewell,0.17509496
was absolutely delightful I found a very few negatives about this movie I thoroughly enjoyed,0.046298776
it would recommend it to anyone there's maybe one or two three to five second,0.025767218
shots that didn't entirely line up maybe I was missing something but that was the,0.04980097
only negative I found here overall I was completely blown away by the joy that,0.049808286
The Farewell brought to the table from the beautiful story to the performances to the,0.027868534
humor and light-hearted tone and again this family dynamic and also making really think about,0.031211747
things I cannot recommend the farewell hire like you need to go see this movie,0.057429295
