taking over Asgard who will succeed tonight as far as the story goes Tyco whitey,0.1960436
knee directs this third Thor film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe we first see Thor,0.060040805
in action on this one world where he is fighting some baddies big and small,0.07531741
and trying to prevent the prophecies and to Asgard aka Ragnarok that whole sequence I,0.036070913
thought was just really cool when I first saw it in the trailer my mouth,0.14259475
just dropped to the floor I love the direction that this movie went in first,0.06350242
of all because it had that balance of light and dark themes that set it,0.020304065
apart from the other two previous Thor films but keeping it consistent with the MCU,0.015017186
as a whole it's definitely a movie that I enjoyed and really got into seeing,0.025694048
right away so as far as the casting goes you've got Chris has both who,0.036167365
was still pretty hot as Thor being one of my favorite Marvel characters still and,0.086104035
it was really sad once he got his hair chopped off but I loved how,0.2907428
he did bring something new to his role this whole transformation of him and his,0.032184247
character with his hair cut off it's like a new I guess version of his,0.18400443
role and just sort of like a rebirth of this character Cate Blanchett who is,0.020383222
hella awesome as the goddess hella who is the villain of this movie and I,0.20856035
was sold on her character it was really cool to see her being this wicked,0.25416487
yet beautiful character who brings out the darkness suited quite well for her and especially,0.06507491
that moment when she broke Mulliner Thor's hammer it was just it still gets me,0.113178335
every time it was just mesmerizing to watch some of her scenes knowing her mostly,0.06544343
as being the Lord of the Rings character Galadriel and I couldn't get evil Galadriel,0.070056476
out of my head when I saw her presence on screen it did seem though,0.122201554
some of her actions felt like it was coming easy to her for her to,0.05263931
accomplish that and that could technically for me not be seen as a good thing,0.029346572
to Ruffalo who is the first time ever being in a thorn but he's returning,0.062275156
his Bruce Banner aka the Hulk I love to see him fighting thorn that one,0.11873861
arena scene but then he ends up helping him along the way which was also,0.02941575
really cool to see they're sort of like back and forth conversations in their chemistry,0.032819495
on-screen it was also really cool to witness how he can be sort of like,0.012308558
fun angry as the Thompson who plays Valkyrie and even though I didn't originally give,0.040320773
two craps about her even though sometimes her scenes were showing her as being this,0.3627743
badass character I just didn't really like her life delivery at times Karl Urban who,0.3326805
plays scourge scourge he's got brawn but maybe not the brains but he's got a,0.22615057
fine collection of many human gadgets it was really interesting to see what he could,0.073405676
bring to this character especially being held his right-hand man Jeff Goldblum plays the Grand,0.03425097
Master who Thor means after being basically Willy Wonka into his world he's this interesting,0.07607639
character who hosts his contest of Champions and he is kind of weird and silly,0.32841817
at times I don't know if that's technically a good or bad thing but certainly,0.02990333
he was definitely met with a few eye rolls coming for me I'm Hiddleston who,0.09929329
returns once again is lucky his role is much shorter in his film but I,0.023469675
thought it was also equally badass he dressed Alva as Hangul I also half expected,0.21579754
to see Benedict Cumberbatch return once again as dr. strange and a little cameo role,0.03166141
that as soon as I knew what was going on on screen in this one,0.030719511
scene before we see him I was like it's Doctor Strange I just know it,0.039714124
and I freaked out let's not also forget about that Stan Lee cameo if you,0.051557053
spotted him he thinks that I liked about this movie there were plenty of times,0.07622738
that I left throughout this film more than I ever had in a Thor movie,0.020638652
and even though the jokes were coming off as ridiculous at times and they might,0.28702268
have gone a little bit overboard and excessive with the comedy but this movie was,0.058603343
fast paced it was exciting it really keeps me interested in everything that is going,0.03561992
on because it's just fun the third act was a hit or miss for me,0.083974116
with whatever was going on there but it was closer to a hit but unfortunately,0.120076954
the things that I didn't really like about this movie was that I wasn't as,0.026109124
impressed this time around with some of the CGI or special effects that were being,0.020639984
used despite it being overly colorful according to the MCU playbook there are times when,0.011184398
the scenes can become overwhelming because there's just so much to look at and so,0.019114718
much going on it it can lose its uniqueness with what we had originally seen,0.052452393
from the first Thor movie but we also see how much of a change this,0.015570619
character has gone into overall I would say that Thor Ragnarok I think was another,0.026453024
impressive take on the Thor character and I have been a fan of this character,0.018521374
for quite some time and I do like seeing more of Chris Hemsworth every time,0.020612711
at the end of the day I would say it Ragnarok I would highly recommend,0.073422305
I'm seeing this movie and I would give this four hearts on the heartbeat scale,0.07448194
