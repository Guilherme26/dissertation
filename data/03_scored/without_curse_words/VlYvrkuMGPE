avengers end game is written and directed by the russo brothers and stars so many,0.097072236
people this is the culmination of a ton of different story lines all coalescing into,0.08314651
a gigantic finale so after the devastating events of infinity war where thanos wiped out,0.1646995
half of all life in the universe the remaining avengers are scrambling to hopefully find,0.15415958
a way to set things right in the universe once again before i get any,0.065396845
farther in the review i do want to give a big thank you to dollar,0.15754332
shave club they are the sponsor for this video and i am proud to have,0.07751988
them as a sponsor and to be a club partner with them so thank you,0.10240038
very much to them stay tuned to after the review to learn a little bit,0.15585531
more about them i'm always weary of films like avengers end game for multiple reasons,0.18323138
one they're very difficult to talk about in a spoiler free review which is what,0.061982192
this is and don't worry i'll ruin nothing of course i won't even hint at,0.20012026
things as many professional outlets already have but the other thing is that these films,0.1529909
come with so much hype to the point where i have basically learned to turn,0.11214701
my brain off from that hype i don't listen to theories i don't listen to,0.23190045
ideas that other people might have i tend to not even read what the plot,0.31089434
is and i don't watch too much trailers or clips or anything i just try,0.10685359
to stay away because hype can ruin a movie and so whenever a film like,0.1513602
this comes around i try to be as disconnected from it as possible and that's,0.08203574
my way of honoring the filmmakers and the writers and hoping that you know i'm,0.058507636
experiencing a film with them that they wanted me to see rather than hoping it,0.09535035
goes in a billion different directions that i have already cooked up in my brain,0.31539705
even though they were never planning to do that in the first place and i'm,0.10749035
happy to say this was a highly satisfying film that brought tons of story lines,0.072727636
to a fantastic conclusion and despite being three hours long really didn't feel like it,0.058093954
it felt about as long as infinity war did it's a beefy run time obviously,0.24173228
and there will be many people who have things to say about that and complain,0.09768362
about that and focus on the runtime but there were just so many things they,0.04406147
had to find a way to present and honor in this film and i can,0.05771977
understand that two and a half hours just probably wasn't enough because they wrote themselves,0.09350091
in a corner at the end of infinity war because you're in this place where,0.24147451
you're like how are they going to get out of this and with serialized entertainment,0.19485423
you're going to have to continue this story and they need an entire first act,0.16012293
to really deal with that and sometimes that first act can feel a little slow,0.12916432
purposefully and when i say slow i don't necessarily mean that it's a bad thing,0.09419364
it's a very somber first act you're you feel like there's desperation this is not,0.13191852
a feeling you normally get in a superhero film usually there's lots of punching and,0.20402862
it's really entertaining and there's plenty of that in this movie but this film takes,0.107150994
a long time to make you feel like you're watching regular people not just superheroes,0.15451452
the avengers in this movie feel the most human they ever have after the ending,0.12587042
of infinity war when you realized how much of them could be expendable when it,0.21591464
came to the mcu's decisions picking up here really does make them feel like normal,0.077462435
people which is extremely refreshing they're not doing superhero stuff the whole movie they feel,0.13128306
like they're they're really desperate like they're scrambling for for really anything that they can,0.13244486
get their hands on and so in that way there's an urgency in almost every,0.118086204
scene which is a writer's dream when when you feel like your characters are in,0.060688354
a place where they are always constantly in motion towards some goal and it feels,0.061556607
like they have no hope the whole time that's really exciting the second act picks,0.07669406
up considerably in the action department with a structure that i actually predicted i never,0.070452236
once publicly predicted it so it's not a spoiler for me to say that but,0.073575094
i just in my head i was like i think they might do this and,0.15189365
they did but it wasn't like i was like oh i guess that i was,0.06781099
happy because i wanted them to do that and i wanted to see what that,0.073821746
could bring about and i was really pleased with what they do and that's all,0.06447827
i'll say but you came to this movie for the third act and it delivers,0.09659668
it's just an hour of insanity it's awesome and the final action set piece is,0.28160968
honestly movie magic it's everything you expect to see when you pay money for a,0.09378128
ticket for a film of this size and it's awe-inspiring really what they do here,0.09240226
and you have to give it to the visual effects designers especially because they are,0.10422359
just doing incredible work but in regards to that third act there's something that gets,0.056215305
tossed around a lot in reviews and it's usually looked down upon and that's fan,0.10992811
service a lot of critics like to pinpoint fanservice and say that's bad and i've,0.16093041
probably even done that before but really as a creator why would you not want,0.067546874
to serve your fans they're the ones who are supporting you and paying for you,0.106112875
and making sure that you can continue to work so naturally you'd want to make,0.15100484
them feel happy and show them things they want to see but that's not to,0.0792265
say this film doesn't take risks they definitely do with some characters and you'd have,0.08591221
to be a big fan of this series to know that they're taking risks there's,0.052892633
things that just i did not expect and it's through the whole movie and you're,0.08010675
like okay that's what they did and for some people they might hate it and,0.24168919
and some might think it's extremely awesome i don't know i thought it was funny,0.10628666
i liked it i'm excited to talk about it in a spoiler video and uh,0.14992629
more more on that later but let's talk negatives because no movie's perfect no matter,0.1237262
how much you want it to be uh except for alien and 12 angry men,0.4652381
yeah yeah those movies are pretty much perfect this film is not paced as well,0.12089792
as infinity war is and a lot of it is because of that first act,0.1300296
it is slow you could call it a slow burn which is probably the most,0.13547856
you know nice way to say that you were kind of bored for a while,0.31089434
and some people will probably say that but they needed it to set up certain,0.049000014
things there are still a few scenes though that do feel like they could have,0.04914948
been cut there are a few specific scenes that don't really necessarily have to be,0.05552653
in the movie but they're there sort of for information sake and that's understandable again,0.09663406
but still there's just a little bit in that first half hour to 40 minutes,0.10171167
where you're like yeah that doesn't necessarily have to be there so it's not paced,0.09469528
as well as infinity war infinity war is a movie that from beginning to end,0.10184447
it really feels extremely cohesive i like that film a lot more than when i,0.07623705
first reviewed it even then i really liked it but i've really come to love,0.083072096
that movie and i would say just as a pure superhero film infinity war is,0.12504354
probably the better movie but endgame is more emotionally satisfying and resonant like i did,0.24100967
tear up an endgame and i did cry and i felt something it definitely hit,0.24932437
me and that's not normal so in some ways you can look at them in,0.3349649
very different ways they're nice companion pieces with each other and i like that i,0.20130803
like that this isn't just a copy and paste infinity war it feels like they,0.09906008
did try to do a few things differently yes you're going to get your massive,0.15460953
superhero battles i mean what do you want to do just flip a coin and,0.14955194
say oh heads i win okay end credits no you want to see him punch,0.60499007
people in the face of course jesus but within that finale there's so much going,0.17708646
on that it does feel like the russos were a little overwhelmed because there are,0.06128963
things happening in the finale and i know they're happening but we don't really see,0.067701004
them because there's so much that they're like we're just going to focus on this,0.06351928
part right now but but i'm like what about that stuff no we're not showing,0.06989586
you that because this is happening oh okay i get it yeah it does sort,0.10507251
of feel like they had things they wanted to happen they got that shot and,0.31089434
said okay we got that shot now forget about that because there's happening over here,0.31089434
that's cooler so it doesn't feel quite as coherent as the massive finale that took,0.0931132
place in wakanda in infinity war although it's still like glorious to look at and,0.13390619
you can absolutely nitpick the out of this movie i mean you can go and,0.20356165
watch it and be like no that is so dumb no and just be that,0.794439
person but like i'm not that person okay you know i go to these films,0.2516795
to have fun i go to these films to enjoy myself and i did and,0.15397643
a story i'm going to give avengers end game an a minus when it comes,0.15313676
to things i wanted to see i saw most of them when it comes to,0.078393765
things that i didn't think i was going to see most of them i was,0.088369004
excited about seeing so i saw stuff and it was good that's my extremely in-depth,0.073189706
review of avengers i can't speak i still have a remnant of a cold i,0.10993735
really do think most fans are going to enjoy this film i'm not seeing it,0.11613885
being an overly divisive movie at all i think there might be a few risks,0.17652205
they take where fans might be divided on it but those are like small moments,0.115238674
i was just talking to a friend of mine about this when a film is,0.06372218
overall really good but there's little things you didn't like you can overlook it you're,0.1461494
like well i love most this movie but that one part but you know what,0.08647041
everything else was so good so it's okay i'll accept it whereas if this film,0.09078163
was just littered with problems i'd want to talk about all those but when you,0.19325638
have so much good happening around a couple little things you can really start to,0.05929697
nitpick and get like annoyingly nitpicky about and at that point you have to ask,0.1647789
yourself is this worth it you know life is short go see the movie but,0.28513616
