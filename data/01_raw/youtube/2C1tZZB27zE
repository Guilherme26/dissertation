hello everybody I am Tiffany here with Bella and flareon once again to bring you another movie review I'm super excited for this it is award season time guys the Oscars are coming up soon the SAG Awards the Golden Globes have already happened a bunch of nominated movies are out right now that I really have wanted to see so just warning you you are going to get a lot of nominated movies these next couple of weeks because well that's what I've been watching so I can keep up and all my nominated movies the movie I am reviewing today is one of those nominated movies and the movie I am talking about is Luther needy bird it has an amazing cast it has Saoirse Ronan who was in Brooklyn and she's been around for a while like ever since she was a little kid she was in Atonement did you know that she was briney in atonement he's also Laurie Metcalf in this movie Lucas hedges who was in three billboards as well and Manchester by the sea he is just killing it right now so good for you Lucas hedges it's also directed by credit Gerwig I'm sorry if I pronounced any of those names wrong it overall just has an amazing cast and amazing team behind it and I believe chronically directed wrote it produced it she did everything basically so good for you Greta Gerwig you are amazing I was super excited to see it everybody's been raving about this kind of calling it the new Mean Girls a little bit too with watching you now I can see that aspect to it I over all really enjoyed it it definitely isn't my favorite movie of the nominated movies but it's still super good and definitely deserves to be nominated it's a really fast paced movie it's only an hour and 34 minutes people that is pretty short so if you're not looking for a movie that is time consuming or the epic length of Titanic or Lord of the Rings then this is the movie for you because it's the complete opposite of that it definitely is a mixture of drama and comedy it is on the lighter side in my opinion it has its very serious moments but there weren't any moments in it for me that made me cry insanely or just burst out into tears and meet issues or anything like that overall it's still really good and it definitely does give you the feels it just doesn't bring you to Fault in Our Stars level you get me as you can see I'm wearing pink because well her hair is pink in here and I think her cast is pink so I figured pink would work pretty well for this movie review for those of you who want statistics this has an eight points zero on IMDB that is mind-blowing amazingness alright that means it deserves to be nominated and it does it deserves this rating it's super duper duper duper super duper good for those of you who want a synopsis and have no idea what Lady Bird is about it follows this girl named Christine who nicknames herself Lady Bird as she travels through her senior year of high school and is about to go off to college and it's a coming-of-age story has a little bit of Mean Girls esque feel at one point in time and overall it's about her growing up and becoming an adult and experiencing stuff in life that she has an experience before in her past I definitely believe this movie appeals to the young adult crowd people that are 17 18 19 my age just because it is that coming-of-age story and it is going through that senior year of high school and just being 19 years old right now and watching this movie I definitely related a lot to it and empathize with her law on certain things just because she goes through some typical high school stuff she goes through different changes she deals with her family dynamic again and it's that moment in time where you're about to move on to your life and become an adult and go off to college and live your life I just really appreciated it especially at my age right now and I definitely want to watch it when it wait older and to see a different perspective that I get on it I definitely recommend this movie for people to watch I think it's really really great and I think oh absolutely enjoy it so sure Ronan did an amazing job and if you watched the Golden Globes I believe she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress Laurie Metcalf got nominated I think that'd be the only thing that I had an issue with this sometimes it seems with a little bit too fast and there were moments in grey that I wish they had just kind of stopped and let's sit there for a little bit for the audience but other than that it's overall really really great movie that's really all I can tell you without spoiling you so I suggest you go now non spoilery people go watch this movie and then come back and we can talk about all the feels together alright good blue [Music] get it bird lady bird overall like I said I really did enjoy this movie Saoirse Ronan I felt like did an absolutely great job her character was just super fun interesting seeing the dynamic of her going to a Catholic school and also growing up and being a senior and dealing with the very strict environment the relationship between her and her mom was absolutely interesting and I think Laura madcap did an absolutely amazing job because while she was tough and strict on her daughter and it irritated me I felt ladybirds irritation you also felt the love from her and you do get in a way she's trying to push Lady Bird to be her best self but she doesn't always do it in the best way you don't have to be that hard on your daughter she's doing the best she can and probably your attitude is what's causing her to rebell even more I do like that Lady Bird even acknowledges in it that her mom does love her and cares a lot it was just a very interesting dynamic because you can see Lady Bert's irritation with her mom but then you also get that Lady Bird understands her mother's love and I thought that was really cool that it wasn't just this contentious relationship I both understand each other and they have their really sweet moments one of the best moments between them is when Lady Bird is very hurt by her boyfriend Kyle because kayo lied and said he was a virgin when he wasn't and I mom picks her up and Lady Bird gets in the car and she's crying her eyes out and you're feeling for her and her mom just hugs her and goes do you want to go to our favorite thing and Lady Bird says yes and then they just go to different houses and look at different designs that was just a really sweet moment and it gives you insight into their relationship without you having to go through the whole backstory of her from being a kid to now I love ladybirds dad he was super kind super caring and you could see all the effort he put in he was definitely a character who wasn't in it as much as I thought he was going to be but he still made a really good impact which I really really loved baby birds dating life though I just felt bad for her she falls in love with Danny first and first of all Danny I'm gonna kill you it's just wrong to do to a girl I get it you're trying to hide it and I felt bad because he in a school where that is really not allowed so I understand hiding it but the fact is that he didn't let ladybird know and she believes that he was truly in love with her and he wasn't he was just using her and he felt bad for him because you can see he's a genuinely good guy I just was like why would you just not tell her I mean I understand in one way but you don't need to lead her on like that you can say hey I don't really think we should date that's what you can do you don't have to explain why if you really don't want to I did feel really bad for him and again there was the sweet moment where he does visit her and he's freaking out because she saw him kissing another guy and he's saying please don't tell and she just hugs him and goes I'm not gonna tell and he breaks down in her arms so that was really sweet and that was one thing about Danny is he did mess up really bad but you can see he genuinely I think cares about ladybird as a friend more so and he was just scared he didn't handle it right no he overall was just scared and was looking for a way to make sure it wasn't really ever found out Kyle on the other hand I did not like as soon as he was saying to ladybird oh yeah I haven't done it with anybody either I just went liar you're a liar it was very obvious I'm sorry that there's no way he hadn't been with somebody like that before oh it sucks it sucks because at that moment it's just taken away from you because you think you're sharing this moment with someone and then he's saying oh yeah I've done it before heaven he's denying that he ever said that he hadn't done it before and I just wanted to rewind the movie somehow and play it back for Kyle and say there you said it right there right there right there right there I loved ladybirds best friend Julie she was super super sweet and kind and she reminds me a couple of my other friends too I just loved her she was probably my favorite character actually just because she was so genuinely kind and sweet and you could tell she meant well I mean Lady Bird made her rubella a little bit but overall she was a goody girl of this whole entire movie I did have issue in a part of the movie where it goes mean girl just because I felt like that flip was insanely fast and that sometimes happens throughout the yes that seems didn't linger long enough for to have the super emotional impact that it did and I just felt like that transition from Lady Bird abandoning Julie and going to Jannah was just SuperDuper quick because all you see is her have one conversation with Kyle then all of a sudden she's talking to Jenna and completely ignoring Julie I felt like there should have maybe been one more scene or so I kind of connected it a little bit more because while you get the sense that Kyle is popular they don't really connect him to Jenna completely I mean you understand that once she starts talking to Jenna but still it wasn't like he said he was best friends with Jenna or anything before unless he maybe said it in the scene when they talked that they did I'm sorry I don't remember that though I feel like they should have had one more scene where maybe she sees Kyle hanging out with Jenna or something and then lady 4 decides oh you know I'm gonna get it with Jenna so I can go see Kyle I just see how quickly she turned away from Julie that was frustrating but also again I felt like that happened too quickly because again if you're going for that Mean Girls vibe you don't completely go against your friend like that automatically all of a sudden she's needs truly one time then they're not talking anymore and I'm thinking why why because Julie's amazing you need to go for Julie over Julie right right Donna Lauria and go for Julie you knew it wasn't gonna work out with Jenna Jenna was just annoying she was the most annoying character actually she ties with Kyle her and Kyle we're just look look what you can tell you not a good friend where she finally realizes where Lady Bird lives a good friend would have said I don't like that you lied to me but you don't need to be ashamed of where you live instead Jenna just goes I don't like this honesty we're totally never ends I think I hit that right on the mark what do you guys think after that her and Jenna just kind of fall off the map which I was quite happy about because I don't like Jenna and my other favorite moments is when she does go get Julie and brings her to prom it was funny because the ones we got to looking at them dancing thinking were you guys doing but in the end it ended up being just this really sweet moment and going to prom with your best friend is the best thing ever I'm just saying you don't need a date to go to prom you can go with your best friend overall though felt like it was a great movie but again I did have a little bit of trouble with the quick editing just because it left some of the characters a little bit underdeveloped I felt like for example Miguel and his girlfriend Shelley Shelley seemed like a really interesting character and you have one moment with her and Lady Bird when they're smoking and she's talking about ladybirds mom and how she really admires her and that's really the only time you completely get to know Shelley and Miguel you get to kind of know here and there but not fully and again his moment is really when he's about to go get the job that his dad actually interviewed for as well overall those were just two characters I felt like since everything moved so fast you really didn't get to sit with them and understand them a little bit more the only thing I really actually didn't like sadly was the ending there's a super fast paced movie yeah the tragic moment where the mom doesn't get out of the car to say goodbye to her daughter who's flying to New York what the heck and she runs out of the car and tries to say goodbye but misses her and she's breaking down in the father's arms and you feel for her but then I'm saying it's your fault because you didn't get out of the car the first time and you've been a jerk to her about this even though she got it even though you thought she wasn't gonna get in so she proved you wrong in that you should just own up to it and eventually just prohibit her but what it does is cut you her in New York and basically what it shows us her goes to this party get drunk make out the dude throw up the dude brings her to the hospital and then she gets out of the hospital find her way back to church even though after going to the Catholic school it seemed like she really wanted to stay away from religion and then she calls her mom and leaves a message and says I love you and it was a very sweet moment do not get me wrong I loved that she said I love you to her mom I think that is a great way to end it but it didn't feel complete after that I was waiting for more the movie to show her being successful in college or that her mom listened to the voice message you see her mom's reaction to it I was waiting for something and then all of a sudden she says I love you and then the screen goes black and the credits start rolling and I was sitting there going that's it so I don't really know how to feel about the ending I feel like I wanted to happen was seeing her really thrive for being College and show that she's alright when her mom really didn't think she was going to be I guess then had this moment where she really does miss her and get through that call or just something maybe if they had added a scene at the end where they showed the mom reacting to the voicemail and you know the mom got the voicemail maybe I would have felt more complete about it all I'm not sure there's just something missing at the end for me and maybe you disagree with me and think it was the most perfect ending ever and I feel like it could have been a perfect ending I do like how she said I love you to her mom at the end but there was just something else needed I felt like and I'm not sure what it is and it's killing me and I don't know what it is and maybe everybody else thinks it's a perfect ending and I'm just crazy what do you guys think of the ending for those of you who have seen it do you agree with me do you think it was a little bit short or do you think that it was a great ending overall that is really all I have to say about this movie though I thought it was overall pretty good there were little problems here and there but I just absolutely enjoyed it still overall
