so Alfonzo Kieran's Roma uh a lot of people know Alphonso Curran from stuff like,0.097025685
gravity and children have been or if you've never seen any of those films you,0.16007245
probably know him best from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and if you,0.025721986
if you're familiar with qur'an's work and stuff like you know gravity especially you know,0.023683865
that he likes to do to do big and long and long one take shots,0.18924075
where where he does like you know everything like you know you know like Goodfellas,0.038107704
type stuff or you know it's just like the one following camera and over one,0.03275963
long shot which there is there's a lot of that in Romo but actually it's,0.030939022
it's kind of interesting because Romo doesn't feel it does feel big in in terms,0.028360104
of like how its shot and its scope but its story it actually feels the,0.06325963
story actually feels pretty pretty simple I mean in terms of how its set up,0.071466
here it takes place in the 1970s in Mexico City I believe yep in Mexico,0.035524797
City or essentially we follow this character of Cleo who's a made for this for,0.041226085
this Mexican family and she you know she she works well with the kids you,0.083960146
know she she likes them she doesn't mind working for the family they they have,0.08246548
a good relationship you know the you know the mother and father they're they're not,0.047659744
on good terms but there are good terms with Cleo they they like her and,0.033255856
the kids like her too she's a great person but they have problems with you,0.11057414
know with with you know like there's a revolution going on in their society where,0.07185114
things seem very very heated out out there that you know that that it can,0.03139733
be hard to you know to trust the world out there so of course so,0.067960486
Cleo feels a little bit more at home with the family she feels like she,0.052559488
can connect with the kids and stuff like that but then kind of but then,0.048422042
called like like tragedy strikes when you know when when she connects with this one,0.05342356
boy and she discovers that she's pregnant and once when she breaks this news to,0.061019957
her boyfriend her boyfriend was basically just you know just out of there he's like,0.1025048
you know I pretty much like won her on a date and she says that,0.031529706
oh I think I'm pregnant he's gone out of there and when she later confronts,0.121093355
him he's just he's like no it's not mine and he's because he's a martial,0.22800858
artist he gets a little bit violent about it saying like like no I'm not,0.14393044
the father I'm not dealing with it goodbye and so it's basically Clio trying to,0.02006726
deal with her pregnancy while also trying to handle this family which the family is,0.04505954
also going through some tough times with each other they're havin they're havin some like,0.020783663
the kids are kind of fighting with each other the mom and dad are fighting,0.084021345
with each other they're going into tough times and it's even tougher for Clio and,0.043420527
it's even tougher for society at large because there's a there's a revolution going on,0.0475879
in the streets and people are running around and protesting and some people are getting,0.053516686
shot right in front of them that's just it's it's horrifying to them it'sit's quite,0.532787
the experience but I love the fact that we always feel focused on on Cleo,0.043928728
Cleo is always always in focus we always focus on her we feel what she,0.039217897
feels we hear what she hears and see what she sees and and I guess,0.040217668
I mean I was gonna try to find a good way to segue into this,0.05108477
but I just I love the way that this one was shot I love the,0.03238513
way that they do have that they do kind of have like the long takes,0.030313749
but they're not it's kind of like elaborate long takes like there's one scene where,0.014804327
they're in a where they're in a furniture store and they're they're looking for like,0.029657878
a crib for Cleo's baby and they they're looking around and then they hear some,0.07380213
noise outside and the camera kind of tilts around and it looks outside and there's,0.016942892
like a you know there's gunshots in the screen there's all these protesters running they,0.03243635
look down from the window locks on the second floor and then they pan over,0.035770915
and they see some protesters run inside trying to hide and then while then we,0.05774792
while we pan with them we see some you know some people coming after them,0.028556999
with guns and they basically shoot them in the middle of the store there and,0.6816019
then we focus back on on Cleo and her reaction and her hurting the terror,0.18461508
on her face especially from what happens in that scene which I don't want to,0.12190022
reveal there's a lot of tragic stuff that happens in this film that I don't,0.025539726
want to reveal just because it's so heartbreaking and I love the fact that I,0.030960308
don't think there's much music in the film - there's a lot of scenes where,0.020626679
we don't rely on music we just rely on how it's you know how the,0.012723633
scene is set up you know what is the emotion what's happening with the character,0.013344249
especially there's one incredibly tragic moment that happens towards the third act there's just there's,0.024469446
no music at all it feels like it could have been music and again most,0.035085775
of it's pretty much all in one take it feels like very much like a,0.054209806
classic film you know where they they'd hold on a shot for as long as,0.18830019
they could to draw out the drama from it and Kieran does that here he,0.029000012
does that here beautifully especially and a lot of people talked about this too on,0.033714835
the scene at the beach the scene where were both Clio and the family are,0.03842433
together at the beach after they both gone through huge traumatic experiences and they they,0.018715607
basically they break down they connect in that one scene that is that is beautifully,0.04672649
played up just because like it's kind of on like one shot for you know,0.25754368
when you know when it happens by the beach with like the waves and stuff,0.018841991
like that when they've just recovered from another trauma and when they all just kind,0.06331883
of like come together in that one moment when they all connect on it's just,0.03594852
it's such a beautiful moment I just just like the way it's shot in the,0.18478203
way that we go about following Cleo which doesn't feel like it's trying to be,0.021349734
overbearing it's just it works so well you you get engaged with it especially because,0.03806846
like like you've probably seen on the trailer they have a bunch of like nothing,0.14432755
moments there's moments where like like Cleo is just like just cleaning some clothes and,0.085621774
like the kids will be be having like a game of like cops and robbers,0.2932162
and like you know they'll start bickering with each other or there'll be a scene,0.13048574
where you know she's she's serving up one of the boys breakfast and the boy,0.10101878
starts just having these kind of like imaginary conversations about how you know like oh,0.031326823
I was I was a pilot before I died it's like oh really and then,0.12749308
and and then and even just like little moments that seem odd but but really,0.013340923
say a lot like there's one scene where we get to learn about the household,0.035681117
how the car has to park in the entryway which is very narrow so like,0.014731823
every time that their dad comes home he has to be very careful about getting,0.064655185
the car to the garage because it could like scrape against like the size of,0.044630498
the wall and stuff like that little moments like that where we we really do,0.03921457
get into Cleo's world um and and where we get to we get to know,0.0467664
enough about this family so that when tragedy strikes it strikes hard it it really,0.05637165
hits you to the core that there were there were moments in this where I,0.12936158
was on the verge of tears with how with how with how much like horrible,0.10408727
stuff happens to these characters and it's great because it doesn't feel like it's it's,0.030282486
trying to go too over-the-top with the tragedy it feels it feels very rooted in,0.01883135
reality as opposed to to melodrama and it actually plays out in a very very,0.059437484
beautiful way that that if it doesn't that you know for some people I can,0.032217506
imagine them seeing it as melodrama but I think it plays out in a way,0.04651696
that's that's very satisfying towards the end so so for roma i and i can't,0.024287185
underst I can immediately hear from people saying oh you know it's it's a foreign,0.0629164
film it's black and white you know it's it's stuff that I'm not gonna understand,0.15435453
I'm telling you if if you can understand you know what it's like being a,0.03683521
parent or caring for kids or being in a relationship that doesn't work I can't,0.023427768
see why you wouldn't be able to connect with this even for being you know,0.035167594
a foreign film where it's all spoken in Spanish and it's all black and white,0.0310082
and there's lots of like kind of like pillow shots of like water on the,0.080139995
ground or or beer bottles on tables and stuff like that I think I think,0.03282216
people will still be able to connect with that and also come on it's beautifully,0.068650946
shot like I said that scene at the beach is amazing just all the the,0.24791677
the cinematography is amazing I love the the very human story I mean this is,0.053621117
you know Alfonzo Kieran you'll see deals and kind of like you know fantastical stuff,0.044095024
like you know like children of men and gravity and Harry Potter but here this,0.07153518
was probably this most human film and the more I thought about it I kept,0.029072516
thinking you know because it feels so human and more relatable I think this this,0.051406056
might be my favorite Alfonso Kira on film and that's saying something because I do,0.029428389
really hold children of men up there high like the those shots in children of,0.49330202
men were like with you know like a lot of people know the car sequence,0.08433464
and then you know the the going up the apartment you know one talk well,0.014930712
the going up the apartment stairs one take shots those are those are great that's,0.13573338
probably one of my favorite films ever but I think I think roma Roma kind,0.048130695
of beat seroma just has it feels like it has a lot more to say,0.14028324
and it just it's it's such a great human story that's easy to connect with,0.03807711
that I think I just I I can't get my mind I'm still thinking about,0.033849865
this film days after seeing it so see after Roma 5 out of 5 stars,0.037820347
I just what can I say it's it's my favorite I'll found silkier on film,0.041622534
