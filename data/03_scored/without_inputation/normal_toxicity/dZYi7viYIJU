hey how's,0.0652173
it going everyone angie is back again for another movie review and today I'm gonna be hitting you guys with my thoughts on the latest Pixar movie and that film is of course Coco,0.46010867
now this film is very interesting,0.069751896
because I'm just gonna say right,0.10713737
now Coco is one of the best experiences that I've ever had seeing a Pixar film in theaters and this has really reinvigorated my love for the company because you know as it stands in the past,0.066263914
ten years of Pixar movies what we've had a lot of great standouts such as up and Toy Story three everything else has just sort of been met - okay that was great for what it was like for example movies that I personally enjoyed but to be honest I didn't feel they were 100% necessary you know the Monsters Inc prequel what was that all about finding dory while it was,0.072504155
fun it was just kind of like okay did we really need,0.06068531
this this feels like it could have been its own animated,0.14855638
series,0.033561606
and then you just get things that you got to avoid entirely such as the car astrology and then you have stuff that doesn't even feel like it was made by Pixar,0.10620647
it looks more like a DreamWorks title that movie being brave,0.09030584
so well we've had good movies like inside out I was kind of waiting for like the next big thing from Pixar the next thing that would just you know mark it's whatever thing on the Pixar legacy floor mat or whatever that I'm tapping on that's short of stick,0.14703262
and thankfully Coco delivered on that front Coco is without a doubt one of the most unpick star movies that there is as I was watching this movie I kept thinking to myself like yo this is not really something that's up Pixar's ality not to say that all Pixar movies are the same but they kind of have that regular stick like Oh what would you do,0.0859064
if toys could talk what hilarious hijinks would they get into,0.44731885
Oh what would you do if ants can talk,0.087290384
let's see the hilarious hijinks that they get into but with Coco it just I couldn't put it in a box and that's what I loved about it,0.31089434
yes,0.036876976
you could say stuff like oh it's a story about skeletons and they're talking but it's really not the point of Coco at its core,0.07828132
Coco is a movie about family,0.067542456
which I'm sure you could get from watching any of the trailers and seeing commercials and stuff aspect of Koko is one of the most important parts about it,0.06558563
and I absolutely loved the way Pixar handled approaching the concept of family,0.057513237
and what it means because when you have these animated movies especially kids movies the like these big themes like family and friendship for the most part,0.10517452
they're done in a very cheesy way that's just ok,0.09586136
yeah it's fun for the five-year-olds,0.10220288
but what about for the people who are like 20 plus years old like,0.09346572
what are we gonna get out of this,0.121839896
what are we gonna learn with Coppola,0.21031542
they were able to show you that family is very important and it shows that not all families are perfect perfect example the main character,0.08945135
in this movie named Miguel,0.0925729
he has this dream of being the world's greatest musician he loves music but due to circumstances that I'm not gonna spoil with his family,0.16904081
he doesn't really have the opportunity to do that because they're just so set in their ways on avoiding music because there's very there's a very negative connotation with the music,0.1014398
and it deals with the family lineage as well and I love the way that they tackle that sort of stick,0.083216466
I mean it's not groundbreaking by any stretch of the imagination,0.10335488
but it's done with a lot of heart,0.05610204
and that's what I really love,0.06673782
if they're gonna be taking these stories that people have done time,0.07973644
and time again like the stories of friendship and family,0.059793457
and what it means you know more often than not people like to turn it on their heads and make it like like fast,0.33986607
in a few years for example not saying those are bad movies but they really plan the fact that family is not just blood family is people you have connections with that's a good representation of that,0.11099564
but again it's sort of kind of a given like okay,0.0722945
you would go,0.09781865
that route Coco still has the same basic functions of what it means to be a family,0.08566416
but it makes it feel genuine and real because I'm sure many of us have gone through the situation and it's not done in a real ham-fisted over-the-top cheesy way,0.14969969
so in that respect I really liked it,0.07258976
and in terms of just how beautiful this movie was I was just so surprised at the color palette and how much just life existed in the movie everything just felt,0.08580098
so freakin Pixar is unmatched when it comes to that I mean they're a great looking DreamWorks films and blue sky or whatever,0.3660827
but when you watch this movie and you look at the attention to detail that exists on the characters clothes and their hair and like for example whenever they come in contact with water,0.05836563
it's just honestly felt like I was watching human beings moving pixar's dangerously close to the point where we can actually see realistic characters on screen and it doesn't look CG like that's where they've gotten to the point,0.0992104
and it's just it's phenomenal,0.061260562
I loved the look of this movie I loved the look of you know just like,0.08119504
they just sheer amount of color that exists with it because it really goes,0.18317689
well with the themes of the film,0.04242432
you know a couple that with the fact that the movie in general has a lot of humor and heart attached to it,0.062063202
I think that a lot of people are gonna get a ton of enjoyment out of Coco,0.15502422
it's a movie that I think will appeal to everybody whether they are a kid or whether they are a adult especially considering it tackles,0.16380662
so many adult esketh Eames that you don't necessarily see a lot in kids mediums like cartoons,0.18094099
they don't really talk about the concept of family and how things get divisive and how the like dealing with the concept of death and passing on and what that means and just overcoming,0.1289443
like,0.02861636
these are things that I watch the movies when I was a kid like 20 years ago and the fact that we're still getting these movies is really awesome because I can show these movies to my eventual kids one day and say hey I grew up with this this is a great movie that explains this to you,0.06834146
and that's you you know I had the Lion King you know teach me the understanding that you know death isn't necessarily,0.19624655
a bad thing,0.15046899
you have to take your place in the world,0.3595484
when the time comes likewise I can show my children Coco and what this really means and how family is important even though we bicker through this,0.10970129
and then the other so yeah man Coco on that front was awesome,0.26852912
and can I also point out the fact that this is one of the darker Pixar movies like I'm not gonna spoil anything,0.154506
but there's a moment in this movie where they just go straight up M night,0.14550449
Shyamalan like really good M night Shyamalan like and night Shyamalan twist,0.18200745
that's just like whoa,0.17930216
you know I'm saying I had two of those in this movie and it's just so on Pixar because they do not beat around the bush,0.13563746
they tell you exactly what happened,0.062376782
and I got to credit them for that because they don't pull you for a fool like,0.8785311
oh this happened because of something corny and cheesy,0.40329117
no this happened,0.08285072
because this is how what happened in the real life,0.08035721
so yeah we're gonna do that I was left speechless and I I'm pretty sure a lot of the parents were in there just like whoa look away kids and they're just watching like yes this is this,0.110217385
this is what I paid $15 for yeah yes intrigued but in closing guys I freaking loved Coco it's definitely one of my favorite Pixar movies and by the end of it like many folks I was very close to shedding a tear,0.2428616
I honestly didn't expect it until I just got this rush of emotions,0.10570689
and it was just like oh man I'm so happy but so sad Oh comment down below if this movie made you feel emotional in any way shape or form,0.124101974
what did you think about Coco,0.08844538
let me know down below in the comment sections and for meteor for now my name is NGS signing out and like always I will catch,0.10238418
