and welcome back once again to my channel,0.07535196
this is my second video of the day first up was Mary Poppins returns and now you're talking about the favorite a movie that I actually watched right before Mary Poppins returns this is a movie that I was anticipating,0.092012726
I was a little hesitant about it,0.06359096
but I heard good things going in,0.03568183
so I was excited to watch the film if you guys don't know how my reviews work,0.1540805
I like to talk about the good the bad and then give you my score,0.17196102
I continue to give you this feel but I want you guys to know there is a lot of stuff,0.09303942
coming out on this channel in the next few days,0.13807017
I have best and worst on Netflix counting down my superhero films next week my top 10 best and worst of the year but right,0.18045571
now we are talking the favorite a movie I had to watch before I made that top 10 best list and I'm glad I watched it let's talk about the good,0.05450481
so in eighteenth-century England the close relationship between Queen Anne and Sarah Churchill is threatened by the arrival of Sarah's cousin Abigail Hill resulting in a bitter rivalry between the two cousins to be the Queen's favorite and what a film this was it is not going to be for everyone,0.073380455
but this is the most audience friendly movie that your ghost,0.14258148
lanthum owes has done so far,0.058855843
and I do believe the favorite is his best movie I watch killing of a sacred deer,0.5015352
I liked it,0.06625055
I didn't like it as much as a lot of people liked it,0.07444012
I thought it was a bit underwhelming enjoy the film style enjoyed the technical aspects,0.18821795
but the story did not grip me like the story for the favorite did and the performances while they were great these performances are some of the best I've seen all year Olivia Colman Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone all three are going to be considered for Oscars should get nominated for Oscars,0.06164618
and another performance that not a lot of people have been talking about that I've heard of so far,0.09778587
nicholas hoult gives possibly my best performance that he has ever given other than of course our boy in Mad Max and the beast in x-men,0.3413372
I like those for other reasons but acting wise,0.09181139
I think he is brilliant in this film all the performances are top-notch they should be nominated considered possibly winning level performances,0.06739645
now I did just see Emily Blunt and Mary Poppins that was a great performance but it's just going to be such a great competition as it should be because the director just brought out so much in these characters,0.036657773
and the writing some of the best writing I have seen all year the dialogue is so crisp,0.030617828
it's funny it's witty its off-the-cuff,0.071122445
it seems like and it has that level of humor,0.070637666
some of the humor is in your face,0.4033144
in a good way,0.055769667
some of the humor is subtle,0.076862186
it has the best balance of two completely different styles of humor that I have seen all year and it's real it's real dialogue,0.04022132
it's not like these people were completely proper and they are completely against humor,0.24352735
no there's a bit of corn ball in here these characters are goofy they are not afraid to be themselves,0.4498389
they're not afraid to open up to the world,0.103958376
and that comes back to the plot in the direction that this movie goes because it really does just open itself up and allow us to dissect,0.09876494
what is happening,0.05660691
even though we may not completely know what some of these metaphors mean there's a lot of things in here that you really need to dive deep into,0.08107762
and I should have watched this movie twice before I reviewed it just because there is a lot happening in the background a lot to pay attention to a lot of things especially towards the end that tie back to the beginning things that characters say lines of dialogue in the first half come back to play in the second half and the way that the movie ends is going to be interpreted in different ways by a lot of different people I'm not saying,0.04108978
it's an open-ended ending,0.14241621
it's just an ending that you can think about,0.24084942
and oh maybe it meant this,0.05731726
but maybe it meant this not inception style,0.08715328
you'll know when you'll see it it's hard to explain it but it's something that people will be able to dissect,0.10753206
and I think that's going to make the movie even better in the long run and here's an odd comparison I enjoyed a movie like the mule,0.24235785
I had a good time in the theater,0.051201623
but once I walked out and started to think about it and dissect the characters,0.06430882
and some of the acting,0.06444966
I really kind of cooled down on the film I didn't like it as much as I did when I walked out with the favorite,0.08755491
I don't know if I sat there,0.066607215
and I was on the edge of my seat like oh my gosh what's going to happen,0.17782271
next,0.028648289
no,0.06626663
I was just invested in these people's lives so the entertainment factor while it was there it wasn't super strong,0.11004047
and I wasn't super like on the edge of my seat,0.10986653
but after I walked out and I started think about it,0.053706147
and I started to dissect the characters and what that ending actually meant and how some characters were just completely treated in the wrong way and got completely screwed over if we're being honest I'm not going to say who it really made me like this movie so much more and those are the best movies in my opinion the ones where you can walk out,0.24089001
think about a little bit,0.12501104
dissect to have conversations with your friends unfortunately I saw this by myself,0.3618937
so I couldn't have any conversations but I still really enjoy just sitting and riding out my review on letterboxed and thinking about it,0.19419725
and that made the movie even better lanthum as always brings a distinct style in his films killing of a sacred deer and the lobster they're all odd they're quirky,0.19001296
and the favorite is probably his most quirky film but like I said at the beginning of this review it's also his most audience friendly,0.06881016
you can get on board with these characters,0.09708851
you can understand this a bit better than something like the killing of a sacred deer and you can get invested in these characters a little bit more,0.33612624
and I loved loved loved loved,0.049259886
the technical aspects the film style using the fish eye lens for certain situations close-ups and he always does this,0.037552826
but I noticed it even more in the favorite,0.06420685
I love when we look up on a character usually we're looking straight forward or down,0.107517876
but having the camera lower and looking up at Emma Stone's character and looking up at Olivia Komen's character it was an interesting choice and it allowed us to really dive even deeper into the psyche of them,0.07241148
it's something we see on television a lot not as much in movies but I really like the decisions just the mixing of different film styles makes this film even better than I think it would have been and it elevates the material as well this movie was funny the general audience that I was with we were all laughing invested,0.061454765
it takes some twists,0.085014835
and turns that you definitely do not anticipate,0.16332157
I had no clue where this story was going and I loved how this thing,0.04296718
this giant war this peace treaty it's all going on in the background,0.15739177
but that's not what we're focused on we're focused on the interactions the jealousy within Rachel and Emma's characters,0.07216629
you don't know what's going to happen next between them,0.31089434
you can see it build up,0.06947849
and then once it comes to a head,0.19159982
and then once you get that reveal about halfway through the movie or like,0.056660645
oh I did not see this coming,0.07285095
and it continues to increase,0.083238915
it continues to get a little bit more heated,0.16013615
if you know what I mean you know what I mean you've seen the movie but it just it keeps elevating and once it comes to a head it really really hit in terms of negatives,0.1802691
I mean I don't have that many it wasn't the most entertaining movie I've seen all year,0.0633994
there's not a major event that happens,0.09149132
but there doesn't need to be that,0.060544085
it's a story that sticks to its guns,0.15639219
it does exactly what it needs to do with really great dialogue a hilarious moments and a bit of a seductive nature that I personally really enjoyed did not expect,0.07573263
and if I was there with my parents I would have been like,0.059874456
oh they chose wrong movie some of it may have been a bit too odd for people,0.15297632
and some of the dialogue might be a bit too much in certain scenes,0.07885629
I have this complaint more often than not carry on a bit too long,0.09730782
I think this movie could have been even shorter than it was and I would not have been bothered by that but overall,0.19366187
I think the favorite was worth every penny if you're going and watching in a theatre and I do think you need to see it before,0.15373205
you guys at home make your top 10 lists for the end of the year because if you are a fan of film and the technical aspects and the nature of what makes a good script and I really do think you will enjoy the favorite,0.05325137
and that is why I am going to give this movie a 93 percent,0.08713824
it is on the cusp of being in my top 10 movies of the year,0.072309785
I don't know if it's going to make it,0.13399817
I have to sit down wrack my brain think about it,0.44428438
but I am so excited to finish that list off now that I have seen the favorite,0.06521758
the last movie I have to see really is vice,0.0717341
and then you guys are given my top 10 list,0.054702684
thank you,0.039406788
so much for watching this video,0.114006065
what did you think of the favorite did you like it,0.08195109
did you not like it was it a bit too much was it a bit too pretentious for you I understand that if you believe so but for me a guy that doesn't love period pieces as much as other people do it really sucked me and locked me in the story,0.6384378
thank you guys,0.045313165
so much for watching this video,0.114006065
you are the absolute best,0.1503692
