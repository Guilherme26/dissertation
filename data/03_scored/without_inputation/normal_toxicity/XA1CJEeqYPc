I am the Mighty,0.03366465
Thor from Asgard Odin's son so let's get this review started alright people,0.10562268
so the highly anticipated,0.06200851
Thor Ragnarok is finally upon us,0.075485945
and a starring Chris Hemsworth Tom Hiddleston Cate Blanchett Mark Ruffalo and Tessa Thompson and basically the premise of this movie we have for trying to prevent Ragnarok from happening on Asgard all right,0.052554857
so let me start off by saying this first the best way for me to describe this movie to you guys is that this is as guardians of the galaxy,0.11870288
this is Asgard meets guardians of the galaxy,0.11698688
so what worked for the movie there was definitely what I'll be saying too much good action sequences,0.036514856
so when you guys go see this movie you're gonna enjoy that aspect of it,0.19939786
and I love the playful banter between Bruce Banner his whole character with Thor and obviously we always loved the playful banter between Thor and his brother Loki,0.08297834
they do awesome job on the screen with that and Tessa Thompson did a good job as Valkyrie,0.09083627
I loved what she brought to the table with that and Cate Blanchett did a good job with her acting um with the character hella,0.26847297
but I just needed a little bit more from the villain aspect of her character alright,0.21919468
so what didn't work for a movie pretty much,0.095060796
it's not like a really really big deal,0.15918036
but the storyline then worked too much for me some people might disagree,0.09270107
but I felt like the storyline didn't work too low with me because they try to incorporate two storylines from the comic books you got Thor Ragnarok and planet Hope and they try to mess it together in one movie and with that being said it was kind of all over the place the storyline wasn't bad but it wasn't good either,0.094387665
and I mentioned earlier that this is as guardians of the galaxy,0.08908792
so there was too much comic relief for my this movie at the end of day is called for Ragnarok,0.0791895
so I needed it to be a little bit more serious and even with the title of the movie Thor Ragnarok I just needed a little bit more of that essence of what actually took place,0.08132974
when Ragnarok happened in the comic books and I felt like they didn't capitalize on it like how I thought they were going to capitalize on it so that,0.089987844
and I mentioned earlier already that Cate Blanchett just wanted a little bit more from her villain so overall people thor ragnarok there's a solid fun entertaining movie that all ages are going to enjoy hulk slow the show he had me cracking up,0.15159799
thor did a good job too loki,0.22460245
everybody did an awesome job in this movie so in a kind of scale 1 to 10 I'm gonna give this movie a solid 8,0.110520065
there was a few things that you know kind of bother me that and they picked about but overall,0.07582037
this is a very entertaining movie so it's definitely worth seeing it imax,0.11732184
we're seeing that regular admission and definitely worth buying on blu-ray when it comes out,0.053475987
