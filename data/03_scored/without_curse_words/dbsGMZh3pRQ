it will be necessary to do a spoiler talk video for Avengers endgame but this,0.078054175
is not that video this is not that time this is a spoiler free review,0.103245206
so peace of mind there that said if this comes across his vague if it,0.24133058
comes across to me just being like well I like things and then there was,0.052875087
a thing and but another thing was cool and that character was high I just,0.05534373
try not to spoil it I said let's talk about this movie that's the culmination,0.11649091
of the past eleven years of the MCU Avengers endgame so Avengers endgame is the,0.06848392
sequel to Avengers infinity war yes Avengers endgame is in fact three hours long Avengers,0.24170937
infinity Wars like two and a half or something like that so really it's one,0.12443211
five and a half hour epic at the end of Avengers infinity war spoilers if,0.104682185
you haven't seen it I imagine you have Thanos went snap and half of living,0.21026458
beings disappeared so now this movie is them picking up the scraps if I would,0.15127073
say life but really general existence that's a big hit everything took so now they,0.1297572
got to lick their wounds help each other up take out Thanos if they can,0.44378972
bring everyone back who disappeared if they can and that's really as much as I,0.11424419
can say about it because that's what the trailer showed there's more going on in,0.051856264
this movie there's always three hours long by the runtime you know it's not as,0.09241561
simple as well gotta take that hose down I guess so the trailers were really,0.0962091
vague it doesn't show really what's going on so I can't talk about what's really,0.09052893
going on because if I talk about what's not in the trailer as people see,0.104955696
it as a spoiler so we'll just talk about how I felt about the movie,0.06385621
I really enjoyed the hell out of it I mean it'd be in three hours,0.273969
long there are slow parts slow parts those slow parts are character building parts I,0.15469696
loved them all I was never bored in this movie for a three hour long,0.14364485
movie to not bore me that's impressive it really does some great things with characters,0.08707748
because where everyone's experiencing some form of pain or loss it's not like they're like,0.08067911
ah humanity disappeared cool well let's go take down the grimace it's not that simple,0.31089434
man this fall out there great character moments come from that like Hawkeye is more,0.10461443
interesting in this movie that needs ever been in any MCU movie ever I mean,0.12103699
it like I mean it I mean granted Hawkeye's character doesn't have a lot of,0.0751312
competition when it comes to Hawkeye's character but no he was quite ravenous movie Captain,0.060269646
America gets more shine that was one of my disappointments with Infinity Ward's like Captain,0.14817493
America I felt like that kind of pushed to whose side I was like no,0.17923121
that it's cap come on he became a favorite cap gets more time to shine,0.15075286
in here I appreciated that I will say this isn't fan OSIS movie like infinity,0.08282131
Wars Thanos this movie for sure this is not that this is the Avengers movie,0.092597246
like Thanos had his movie he not punched all of them now it's them on,0.26284617
the ground clutching their nuts good yeah that hurt didn't it okay let's let's see,0.3128547
you try to get through that you're gonna punch back cool all right is your,0.5740917
moment now cameras on you clutching your balls on the ground so if Thanos made,0.7706507
infinity war for you'd like endgame isn't gonna give you that same feeling for that,0.1781285
out I will say there are moments of conflicting information or at least one in,0.06599
particular where I'm like before you said now it works that's that's conflicting I don't,0.070742704
know just things it's like Thor taking a dying star to the chest Lord can,0.17767325
he really do that I guess he took it to the back it came whatever,0.066825405
they used Captain Marvel really well - I know Captain Marvel's like a hot topic,0.242548
like a hot-button topic right now there's like some weird Captain Marvel economy online if,0.17982306
you make videos about Captain Marvel apparently that's just good for YouTube videos I don't,0.1397346
know why people care that much but I guess they do but they used Captain,0.06683213
Marvel really well in this movie in fact in this movie I concede in this,0.14982231
movie where I'm like oh you mean like she really is powerful like this movie,0.1538313
made me like Captain Marvel more than Captain Marvel's movie made me like Captain Marvel,0.117792666
but this is also directed by the Russos so I think her better director granted,0.12114075
she's not in the movie much so again if you're looking for like oh yeah,0.22358139
a Captain Marvel fest he's not really that so when her sparingly being in this,0.15750562
movie when they did use her I really liked part of the plot that I,0.08692837
actually can't talk about here because you know it's not in the trailer and by,0.08462343
part of the plot I mean it's a big part of it it's familiar to,0.05219775
another movie that I also can't mention here it's very familiar I walked out going,0.075664066
it is like this movie you'll know when you see it when you watch the,0.11772525
movie you'll be like that is like this other movie but as a whole it,0.1504663
all worked out and the last act is really indescribable it's indescribable that's how I,0.07102275
can describe it this is the MCU going yeah here it here it is it's,0.058887076
come to a head this is 11 years built to this guys in the end,0.26831886
that that's what I can say about this movie this movie is that this movie,0.09956006
is the fanservice the payoff that the MCU is giving the fans that have been,0.05876897
here for 11 years or if you haven't been here for 11 years if you,0.08286868
got on the train at any point this movie it's here for you like granted,0.10133381
yeah if you're looking for some highbrow masterpiece if you're all like yes it is,0.105644695
a movie but does it film is it hot you might leave disappointed I mean,0.24233499
it's art as far as I'm concerned but it's not like that it embraces what,0.09043684
it is and it changes the game and it's almost when I was driving home,0.03808377
I was just thinking to myself it's impossible to rate this movie as a movie,0.05706887
in and of itself it's not a contained experience it's not just this one movie,0.08026052
it's not just one movie it's chapter 22 of a saga and Odyssey a legacy,0.056881584
like if you come into Avengers endgame you're select all right yeah I'm loosey-goosey with,0.2603786
the MCU some of its alright I haven't seen all the movies I'm gonna check,0.078026794
this out and see how it is you'll probably walk away going oh yeah I,0.187879
had fun with it but if you've been there for the MCU you love the,0.06413671
MCU you know the heroes you know the villains you know the conflict you know,0.17367761
the strife you know the love you love the characters you know the interactions you,0.17962068
know the relationships if you feel connected to it in that capacity which I personally,0.11213934
do this movie was straight-up made for you it's not literature like Lord of the,0.117746666
Rings but in its own right it's pretty damn impactful I will say Avengers end,0.59156024
game is awesome tacular alright spoiler-free i spoiler-free as i could make it because i,0.13856961
had to talk about the damn movie like walking out of the movie the trailers,0.76421195
are so VAT goes like I don't know what I could talk about oh I,0.09830467
can just go that doesn't matter does it that's not the spoiler alright it's about,0.06477184
this time I would say avengers endgame what do you think is gonna happen what,0.08918777
do you think comment below let me know not going to do that this time,0.1318418
because avengers endgame has been seen and there are people out there who know what,0.09419898
happens in avengers endgame some of those people work to spoil the experience for people,0.12781294
by giving spoilers so there are probably spoilers in the comments section right now don't,0.062179603
even go down there if you want to help the video out give this video,0.17068073
a thumbs up and then just bounce stay off the internet until you see Avengers,0.10082292
