horror movie that isn't trying too hard to be something new he doesn't really put,0.1397153
in social commentary like he did and get out it's just like a very straightforward,0.10079885
but complex and super good horror movie I will say since there are so many,0.12345643
different kinds of horror I would categorize this one as like a very suspenseful heart,0.14894012
like it's sort of on the line between horror and thriller because it is thrilling,0.13676915
and I would say for most of the movie like almost the entire movie I,0.09374403
was sitting on the edge of my seat like clenching my fists because I was,0.15131558
just so terrified for these characters and what was gonna happen to them because pretty,0.13507237

it because it's like that you are your own worst enemy sort of thing and,0.3993752
there's definitely a lot of metaphor in the movie to go along with that theme,0.07121861

part that was important and great there's like really nothing I didn't like about this,0.07665031
movie except for one small thing I felt like at times the dialogue wasn't written,0.10692054
as well as it could have been at times it felt a little bit cheesy,0.27173418
and I think there are two scenes in particular where there's just like a little,0.06370494
bit too much explaining happening and I know when you have a complex movie like,0.12549579
this you kind of need to have some kind of explanation at some point but,0.057234205
there are two parts where there's things being explained and it was a little bit,0.10384099
long for me and I felt like the writing for that scene was a little,0.09763194
bit cheesy and it was just like I don't know it could just be my,0.2818117
own personal preference but something was off about it and I was like I was,0.07138085
