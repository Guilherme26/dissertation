from Minnesota to San Francisco and one day while Riley is introducing herself to her,0.09564269
new classmates sadness creates her first ever sad core memory which joy does not like,0.12347973
one bit joy tries to stop it from becoming a core memory but in the,0.06799936
process causes all the joyful core memories to fall out which in turn gets her,0.14870037
self sadness and those core memories sucked into a tube and sent to the long-term,0.31089434
memory section of Riley's mind so now joy and sadness must find their way back,0.079432234
to headquarters returned the core memories and get Riley's emotions in check now it's been,0.032064106
nearly two years since the last Pixar film and five years since the last great,0.07128934
and memorable one and when they announced that they weren't gonna be releasing a film,0.07851022
in 2014 in order to restructure their company it got a lot of people wondering,0.07787966
what's next for Pixar have they run out of new ideas are they just gonna,0.117535025
resort to prequels and sequels or they're gonna try to reinvigorate themselves and come up,0.07905999
with new concepts and ideas what would be the fate of Pixar so when they,0.12510753
announced that their next film was going to be an original story called inside out,0.07750584
I'm not gonna deny it I thought that sound like a very intriguing concept and,0.112917155
it just had so much promise to it not only did have a star-studded cast,0.09159704
but it also was being directed and co-written by Pete docter one of the heads,0.1785102
of Pixar Animation Studios and without a doubt the funniest director they have there with,0.10045557
such hits as Monsters Inc and the very touching up and with all those elements,0.26629773
put together what you got is a winning combination in a return to form for,0.09738498
Pixar now for those of you who actually sat through the entirety of my top,0.14720416
10 favorite Pixar films sorry for the length not only do I applaud you but,0.099058
you might also recall that I said in that video that Monsters Inc was without,0.31089434
a doubt the funniest Pixar film I've ever seen right we'll move over monsters Inc,0.19643308
because there's a new sheriff in town and that is inside out inside out has,0.10987057
now replaced monsters Inc as the funniest Pixar film I have ever seen and it's,0.2510167
so coincidental because it's from the same guy that made monsters inc this film had,0.4708307
my best friend Steven and I in stitches we were laughing hysterically throughout we almost,0.082354516
teared up and how funny these scenes were and there were a lot of clever,0.13486366
and witty jokes throughout the film there's this one joke in particular that is without,0.07315616
a doubt the most clever joke I ever heard in a film and not to,0.14892577
give away the punch line of the joke but it has to do with deja,0.11916
vu that joke was just a stroke of genius with most of that hilarity being,0.24235378
attributed to the characters in the film particularly the five emotions just the way they,0.016109826
would react to the everyday situations that Riley would get into and the interactions among,0.071490765
themselves priceless pure comedic gold and speaking of gold whoever was the casting director for,0.064863816
this film they did a perfect job at picking who should voice the five emotions,0.11416137
I mean seriously any boy is joy perfect Phyllis from the office has sadness perfect,0.10792639
Mindy calling has disgust perfect Lewis Black has anger holy crap give that person a,0.76933664
raise that is without doubt the best call anybody could make for anger and he,0.13971858
was just enjoying every second of it and every Louis black is immune Emerson it,0.24561387
just was missing a rat that's all I was missing the only emotion that I,0.485559
was kind of so-so about was Bill Hader as fear not to say that he,0.14815827
didn't do a great job he did a fantastic job it's just I felt like,0.10710851
he wasn't really the person that I would say yeah he personifies fear I never,0.22429089
really see that I could see somebody else doing it but again he did really,0.05040969
good he did a solid job as fear and I really enjoyed the pairing of,0.103582144
joy sadness complete opposites having to work together get back to headquarters it freakin writes,0.5154597
itself but they actually do end up growing a rather strong bond through this experience,0.06628071
with joy really growing as a character and realizing that joy cannot be the only,0.109892674
emotion that this girl has to feel they all have to work together as a,0.18350971
team so that she has a great mix of emotions now the concept and story,0.07999625
the concept itself is intriguing really unique and overall creative something that has been missing,0.04112934
from Pixar in the last five years and I'm just so glad that it's finally,0.057618745
back the idea of these emotions personified in your mind that regulate your emotional output,0.29285344
is just a refreshing idea and the story is not just solid but extremely relatable,0.0567406
especially for people particularly kids who have to move from place to place because their,0.24466038
parents jobs demanded of them and have to leave behind everything they knew and love,0.1507648
ask anybody who's ever gone through this and they'll tell you that it is such,0.14531615
an emotional experience to have to leave behind everything you knew love and have to,0.16971022
get acclimated to a new area I have went through that many at times and,0.13811772
I really related to Riley's dilemma in the film and one of the final most,0.026752636
emotional scenes in the film really resonated with me as it was something that I,0.074741706
also experienced and finally the animation Wow I went in Reverse with this review but,0.028907325
the animation once again is solid but it's Pixar you kind of come to expect,0.12398286
that but I really like the look and design of the emotions they are just,0.0402048
on freaking planet they look so freakin fuzzy as if they were designed to become,0.68431467
toys not so some of their Pixar not so simple Who am I kidding I'm,0.15411118
probably gonna buy them all anyway now though my experience with this film is mostly,0.103522
positive I do have a few slight issues with the film the first one is,0.051302522
the pacing of the film was a bit slow in some places particularly the long,0.10957991
term memory sections I mean it just felt like it would drag on for free,0.11121982
and ever and ever which makes sense there in the long-term memory which is like,0.051820863
this huge maze like place but it also ended up becoming really repetitive with them,0.17889993
being so close yet so far were being so close and it's just so far,0.07667064
policy the biggest fault I found with this movie was with this character Bing bong,0.10644958
now keep in mind I'm not saying that he's a terrible character as I said,0.40143162
this character seemed like he would work better in small doses like if he was,0.27804923
in the film for about five to ten minutes and then went on his merry,0.093106285
way that would have been perfect but this character overstays his welcome and stays with,0.09157048
the group for most of the journey and as the film went on the character,0.024587715
went from being whimsical innocent and playful to just overbearing and annoying like we just,0.27854836
have to keep dealing with this character leave him already but to be fair to,0.063307256
the character he does have some really good emotional scenes in the film but they,0.037280377
would have had a bigger impact had he not lingered around for so long but,0.10863542
you know what even with those small issues this is a great film and a,0.061132025
true return to form for Pixar animation studio and I'm just so glad that they're,0.05330477
back and I'm glad that they chose this film to be their comeback film because,0.09116743
I'm gonna give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars I think that it is,0.053923514
