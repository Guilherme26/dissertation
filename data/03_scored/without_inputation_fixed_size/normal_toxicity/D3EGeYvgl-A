today's a rare day when you can celebrate a movie's 100th anniversary because the cabinet,0.07099593
of dr. Caligari was released exactly a hundred years ago today not only that but,0.057656776
from a certain point of view you can also say the entire horror film genre,0.115959704
also turns a hundred today sure there existed many older films that could be considered,0.05773724
horror mostly short films including many by Georges méliès who was the Godfather of special-effects,0.16962989
and introducing fantasy elements to motion pictures and Thomas Edison produced a Frankenstein film in,0.07504656
1910 there also existed many adaptations of Jekyll and Hyde back then but Caligari was,0.052140553
the first where all the elements that we know in horror films came together it's,0.10200532
strange that the old VHS tapes always said the movie came out in 1919 and,0.1443413
that seemed to be the common accepted date for a while but now it seems,0.05946161
that's been corrected it was filmed in late 1919 but premiered in Germany on February,0.06867051
26th 1920 so we didn't miss it it's one of my favorite silent films and,0.080259904
the reason why is because of its visual style that uses elements of German Expressionism,0.12566262
an art movement in the early 20th century where the artist would distort reality to,0.06559101
emphasize their subjective view and emotions as soon as we enter its world we see,0.051756553
a painted landscape of a town on a hill where all the rooftops are leaning,0.06366041
like grass being blown in the wind the town streets have angular splashes of light,0.13929936
beneath the warped gas lamps alleyways slán and disappear into darkness the interiors of homes,0.40495834
have painted shadows creating odd shapes light and shadow are always painted on the walls,0.02936952
things bend at weird angles windows are anything but square sometimes they seem to explicitly,0.14708476
point at something to draw your focus to the most important part of the frame,0.03773916
contrasting stripes of light and shadow extend from its central points the characters themselves even,0.0384742
act like they belong to this twisted environment look at how he moved so unnaturally,0.26158404
guiding himself along the weird scenery and then as he extends his arms mimicking the,0.1538804
tree branches and when you sit down long enough and just give yourself to this,0.23960517
movie it puts you in a trance like you're going into a dream world films,0.31089434
were invented as a visual medium but until then most filmmakers would just film the,0.06290339
real world but then thanks to movies like Caligari they were utilizing film to show,0.06934367
us a fantasy world and escape from reality it's also an early example of a,0.07549726
framing story because it begins with our main character francis sitting on a bench with,0.06949841
another man about to tell him a story you know kind of like Forrest Gump,0.10922878
and that story he tells is the main movie here Francis recalls hanging out with,0.074091814
his friend Alan and their mutual friend Jane who they're competing for romantically but without,0.053947244
drama they go to a carnival where they see an act by a magician named,0.12232366
Calgary who opens a coffin shaped box to reveal a sleepwalker named Caesar or Sasori,0.20500559
I'll just say c-czar I guess because it's a little shorter these are answers questions,0.1018892
from the audience Alan asks how long he has to live and sees or tells,0.05260548
him he won't even make it to dawn and it just so happens that very,0.12126571
night someone comes into his bedroom and stabs him to death even though they only,0.7093121
imply the stabbing with a shadow it's still a pretty gruesome idea for 1920 this,0.55484176
predates the famous psycho shower scene stabbing by for decades and since this movie has,0.4431695
a body count you can call it a proto slasher film in the morning Francis,0.085438095
and Jane are horrified suspecting Caesar they go the police who begin an investigation the,0.12349102
police end up arresting a random man who is caught trying to murder someone but,0.43515173
is unrelated to the person who murdered Alan Jane visits Caligari alone he invites her,0.29623225
to take a close look at c-czar she gets frightened and runs off and he,0.2388832
seems to take joy in it and now it also seems she's been marked for,0.09101537
murder Francis snoops about peering through a window keeping a watchful eye on Caligari and,0.4032813
see SAR while they sleep but somehow CSR is in two places at once as,0.053674314
he emerges outside Jane's win what a creepy shot I love how he pulls the,0.31929135
window off and then slowly creeps into the room there's something real fascinating seeing that,0.15499638
dark slim body moving so slowly toward her bed very deliberate and theatrical he raises,0.32737324
the knife to kill her but when he looks at her again up close he,0.72753507
hesitates as if he has some kind of feelings for her he lowers the knife,0.4441679
he goes to touch her but then she wakes up screams and then he grabs,0.4711101
her and this right here is probably the most disturbing shot of the whole movie,0.2416897
he carries her off up onto misshapen rooftops and across crooked bridges as an angry,0.402817
mob chases after him until he seems to come out of his spell collapses and,0.31089434
dies the police search Caligari again and find the Caesar who's been sleeping in the,0.34281963
box as of lately he's just a dummy Caligari runs away and Frances follows him,0.5767084
all the way to an insane asylum he walks in and asked to see the,0.37019926
director of the asylum only to find the director his Caligari while he sleeps he,0.22596863
investigates the director's office with the cooperation of the asylum staff they find the director's,0.11283185
journals and when they read them it goes into a flashback and since the whole,0.101876035
movie is a flashback it's technically a flashback within a flashback which is pretty crazy,0.38542274
for early silent cinema here we learn the director was obsessed with an ancient mystic,0.069198206
named Caligari who used a sleepwalker to commit murders so he experiments on his own,0.50059074
sleepwalker after the flashback ends the police come to the director's office bringing him Caesars,0.15549171
corpse he lashes out at them they restrained him in a straitjacket and lock him,0.6298041
up in his own asylum then we come out of the main flashback and we're,0.19155669
back to Francis on the bench like we saw in the beginning and I will,0.06812968
say spoiler alert but you may have already seen it coming and the movie is,0.055151187
a century old but it turns out now all along the bench is located at,0.07778059
that very same Asylum and Francis himself is a patient inside we see a group,0.1451303
of characters who are each suffering from different delusions and all them resemble characters from,0.14242135
Francis's story the director walks in who now only resembles Caligari but is not explicitly,0.06441891
the same guy francis flips out screaming that he's Caligari and it seems now that,0.18688473
francis was completely insane all along they put him in the straitjacket and lock him,0.5154597
in the exact same cell from his story then the director says he now understands,0.09753013
his delusion and knows how to cure him but right before the iris closes on,0.2411356
his face it lingers why does it linger is he Caligari or is he not,0.18992832
that's the question it leaves you with a plot twist like this must have been,0.09330777
a pretty big deal back in 1920 you don't often see movies in the silent,0.08419053
era that have something this complex and the fact the character telling the story is,0.040336177
a patient in an asylum it makes you question whether anything you saw was real,0.16614392
it's a completely subjective movie that adheres to no set facts you make up whatever,0.07429788
you want and that's of course why the visuals are so surreal it's meant to,0.091112316
be the world of a madman and that visual world has become the look of,0.5532781
gothic horror films I mean early in the sound era with Frankenstein 1931 you can,0.15375906
see all the traces of Caligari on full display the shadowy staircase the slanted walls,0.0809121
the oddly shaped windows the bedroom scene where the monster sneaks in through the window,0.3185578
to attack Frankenstein's wife it's all there it's also apparent in murders of the Rue,0.43049645
Morgue from 1932 we can see all the buildings and rooftops are slanted at strange,0.08343804
angles it's very common now that type of architecture has almost become standard in a,0.06514015
whole genre of films mainly the world of Tim Burton it seems almost everything Tim,0.09265544
Burton has ever made is in some way inspired by Caligari also the classic theme,0.103396244
of Beauty and the Beast is there the monster falls in love with a girl,0.53490317
and carries her off to the rooftops we see that happen and murders in the,0.31089434
Rue Morgue but this time it's an ape carrying her up the roof and then,0.3659134
only a year after that in 1933 we have an even bigger ape carrying the,0.45437643
girl up onto an even bigger building yes I just drew links from Caligari tumours,0.3855305
the Rue Morgue to King Kong but you know that's only the beginning because then,0.10045666
we trace it to Creature from the Black Lagoon and from that point it's so,0.19065577
common it doesn't even matter it's the classic cliche it's the monster falls in love,0.25115988
with the girl and that becomes his downfall it's Beauty and the Beast it's even,0.44618654
older than Caligari then there's the theme of the mad doctor or villain taking control,0.15403023
of a monster it's been recycled countless times throughout horror movies even the common idea,0.34606433
is there of just being a main villain who's the mastermind and then the obedient,0.24106632
henchman who carries out his plans it's the brain and the brawn it's the standard,0.37583172
superhero cliche and the idea of an evil hypnotist or someone who controls or persuades,0.34294438
the thoughts of common people is opening a whole can of worms the film was,0.2110883
made in Germany between World War 1 and World War 2 and its political aspects,0.11726111
have been analyzed and discussed in detail Caligari is the representation of the authority or,0.03289923
dictator and caesar is the brainwashed person who's forced into following a tyrant and on,0.70527136
that note I want to direct your attention to one scene one tiny little detail,0.20303698
right before Allan a staff there's a brief shot of his hands it's a very,0.255534
weird edit because it flashes by so quick and doesn't really match the continuity of,0.057318687
the other shots for some reason that shot always lingered in my mind and I,0.2624874
wonder I just wonder if in 1928 the political artist John Hartfield saw and remembered,0.040495284
that image when he designed the poster called five fingers has the hand which was,0.07562913
meant to oppose the Nazi Party then in 1998 System of a Down used it,0.23553175
for their cover of their debut album I just make a link from Caligari to,0.043607134
System of a Down possibly since this movie is so old and everyone in it,0.24090672
is long dead we may never know all the details of what it meant and,0.111539796
how it was made I find that adds to the appeal that with silent movies,0.07584872
like this there is a little sense of mystery that goes along with its antiquity,0.10902424
personally I'm so fascinated with those sets I've always wondered is there any possible way,0.06655627
a single piece of any of them has survived probably not and when a movie,0.10724172
almost has no tangible evidence other than the film itself it kind of becomes unreal,0.10264693
in a way like it truly exists in a dream it's most notable actor conrad,0.09692031
veidt had been the star of the man who laughs which was the inspiration for,0.13320692
the Joker he had a career which lasted into the sound era he was in,0.114320144
the sound version of The Thief of Bagdad playing the main villain jaffer when the,0.3561043
story was adapted into the Disney animated film Jaffer became Jafar so if having been,0.04612571
the basis of a famous comic book villain and a Disney villain wasn't enough he,0.28935757
was also the villain in Casablanca which just might be the most critically acclaimed film,0.1088444
of all time if you haven't seen Caligari now's a better time than ever because,0.059843678
nowadays you can see it in high-def clarity when I first saw it in the,0.05475961
early 90s it was on a crappy VHS tape that was when the film was,0.46750748
in the public domain for a while and any low-rent distributor could release it the,0.061095156
copies always looked fuzzy I couldn't tell what was going on with the set design,0.06832748
looking back that kind of made it more interesting because as the movie kept getting,0.07932276
re-released it kept looking better and better so it was like being able to see,0.050796475
more and more of the movie as time went on silent films are interesting because,0.061552122
back then when they transfer them to video they didn't always project them at the,0.06839495
proper speed so the characters moved very rapidly and the movie flew by at only,0.061025206
50 minutes I think at the proper speed Caligari is like one hour 20 minutes,0.13410324
but that used to confuse me I always wondered why is the movie so much,0.07527999
longer are there scenes that were restored but no it's just a different speed and,0.03137474
by watching it slower it definitely gives a different feel you could say it drags,0.05674253
a little at the longer speed or that it helps put you into that hypnotic,0.0652404
mood the title cards are different to the versions I saw was in English texts,0.035563417
real plain and simple but the newest releases have restored the original German titles which,0.15369724
were written in an expressionist style which is real cool but of course if you,0.13034242
only know English then you're reading subtitles over the titles also depending which version you,0.06839032
see you could hear a different sound track because with silent movies there's obviously no,0.09198668
sound so all those different VHS releases would use whatever stock music they had now,0.13095477
with official blu-ray releases they tend to go back to the original sheet music and,0.1555452
recreate what the orchestra would play in the old theater palaces so depending on the,0.055793427
music you hear or what speed it's projected I mean they could totally change your,0.108370155
impression of the film and it really depends on your mindset what type of mood,0.07168199
you're in when you watch it I say put it on at night at some,0.1775892
dark quiet hour and just drift off into the surreal world of the cabinet of,0.15724994
