hey there folks welcome to spectrum pulse we talk about music movies art and culture,0.026289389
and today in another unscripted movie review we're gonna be talk about the newest film,0.04406775
from Pixar Coco so I'm a big Pixar fans surprising nobody I think anybody who,0.07065049
goes into Pixar especially these days they've got such a market and storied catalogue of,0.029397126
phenomenal movies and triumphs of animation that I'd be hard-pressed to find somebody who is,0.038818788
not a pretty diehard Pixar fan yeah the cars movies they're not great they're primarily,0.05841909
there to sell merchandise and there have been some duds I can admit that but,0.07257686
when you take a look at things like the Toy Story trilogy ratatouille wall-e inside,0.097877786
out especially oh my god that movie gets me this day there's a lot of,0.0759826
depth and thematic exploration and a stunning amount of nuance that you don't typically see,0.020661268
in other Animation particularly in stuff that's more marketed towards kids and I can appreciate,0.08513486
that I definitely respect that Pixar is willing to take some chances going through some,0.016309638
pretty dark material there's a surprising number of Pixar films that explore death with a,0.10943469
lot of frankness that I definitely respect and thus it doesn't surprise me to a,0.04871406
certain extent that Coco got released which takes a lot of the celebration around es,0.097404175
de los Muertos and then builds a fascinating way to connect the real life to,0.18184058
the afterlife and what might come after while entrenched in Mexican culture now let me,0.107028715
stress is rather the gate this movie is genuinely great I'm a big fan of,0.016309638
it I want you guys to all see this now and it's also one of,0.04442562
those movies I really don't want to spoil because there's some movies where you can,0.050623138
say that the twist comes in and you spoil it it doesn't really bother you,0.023052605
all that much because it's more of a twist that is more intellectually satisfying and,0.03862921
to discuss the twist brings a lot into whereas this one the twist you can,0.015879264
go man if you've seen a lot of family movies if you've seen a lot,0.039632306
of Pixar movies you could probably Telegraph it I certainly was able to but when,0.033800643
it comes to the emotional nuance underpinning a lot of that I don't want to,0.023577435
spoil that because again this is a genuinely great movie and I really recommend you,0.047873266
guys go out and see it it's already breaking box-office records in certain spots you,0.037984647
know what for a movie in this I think it deserves to cuz yeah it,0.11920424
is that good so let me give you a little bit of an outline of,0.04607328
the story the main character Miguel he's a young kid growing up in a family,0.028088044
of shoemakers like his great great grandfather he wants to be a musician he wants,0.13319437
to play guitar he wants to be part in that Mexican culture and maybe mariachi,0.08231847
it's hard to tell but at the same time he also realizes that his grandmother,0.11825169
is very much against that because his great-great-grandfather reportedly abandoned them would you often seek,0.015528047
his fortune become a musician so when he eventually has a clash with his family,0.07679146
he runs off finds an instrument a very special instrument from a man that he,0.14487633
thinks is his grandfather because that man was the greatest musician in all of Mexico,0.062589124
at that time and then things get a little strange because he discovers there's a,0.020143757
way through that time a deal dos Marcos travel back to the land of the,0.026335286
dead now let me stress this right out of the gate the animation is gorgeous,0.26282915
it's more stylized sure and there are ways that some people could argue that it,0.024639068
ties into it might feel culturally insensitive it was handled by the wrong people but,0.076863304
I don't see that whatsoever primarily because it feels like this movie was made with,0.021690974
somebody with the frankness to frame everything as a very Mexican story told and written,0.022437975
mostly by Mexicans there's lots of elements of unsettled Spanish which I really appreciate in,0.25553748
terms of in jokes it's a pretty overall funny movie but there's a lot of,0.047732912
that that makes you think that it is primarily marketed for a Latin audience honestly,0.0116021335
I'm okay with that the fact that you can still get the gist the fact,0.045299005
that the emotional three line is as strong as it is Thank You Pixar is,0.010184627
a great credit to this story but the thing is as much as I like,0.015957091
that and as much as the music plays such a element in here it ties,0.018124923
into two themes that I do want to discuss briefly as much as I can,0.020688541
without spoilers because the primary theme really is surrounding family and what role you are,0.021739531
given as a part of your family and how you might want to buck against,0.056348372
it I really do appreciate the level of nuance that's brought to the table here,0.036068916
because everyone is looking out for their best interest within the family unit there is,0.010710122
an element that these people genuinely do love each other so when the grandmother wants,0.05533596
to for bid Miguel from pursuing music it comes from a place of deep-seated hurt,0.05362511
and pain that she wants to try to bomb over because of how her mother,0.4724462
got left behind there's a lot of emotional pace that runs through that storyline and,0.026570095
the family does become the root of so much of this question especially when placed,0.03814828
opposite the other theme which is exploring what it is to become an artist and,0.042648915
what you have to give and give up in order to do so because yeah,0.028072745
there was a musician who left his family in this story and the consequences of,0.024483414
what that is and what art he created and where that art becomes properly attributed,0.031193787
if at all in order to discuss legacy going forward in other words where that,0.016876373
art how it might be remembered or whether the artists won't wind up getting forgotten,0.014944681
that becomes a very potent through line through the story and that whole underlying theme,0.016104097
of memory how people think of somebody either alive or very much dead and whether,0.1101125
that memory could be potentially misconstrued or potentially there are gaps in it or what,0.0167307
it truly means to be forgotten especially in that arc of a family that's potent,0.035705063
as hell and honestly as someone who does have very close ties to my intimate,0.44274133
family that did hit pretty hard especially when it comes to the ending cuz yeah,0.24436712
this is one of those movies where especially if you have that tight-knit family experience,0.052616026
or you want to have that tight-knit family experience that it's a bit of a,0.04597949
tearjerker and you know what that transcends cultural boundaries I completely admit that especially with,0.0386638
the undercurrents of bucking against fam maybe to pursue a passion now I can't say,0.084121786
I completely love this movie but it's not one of my favorite movies of the,0.04671585
year I do think it's sofa matically resonant I think its target audience will absolutely,0.07356598
adore it and I'd give it all the credit in the world for that at,0.038976435
the same time a lot of it is bounded in Latin and mariachi music and,0.016090127
a lot of that aesthetic and personally just for me that's not an aesthetic I,0.042817872
entirely love I will admit that it's just a personal play it doesn't do a,0.034163833
lot for me but at the same time for the audience for which it will,0.031685356
resonate and I like how much it is subtly updated and modernized it doesn't feel,0.044704333
anachronistic at all I do appreciate that definitely it feels like a lived-in grown experience,0.032902643
and when the music is on its point at its most authentic and organic it,0.024089625
does sound beautiful and the whole discussion of again tying into artistic attribution taking what,0.06559775
could be a simple song and magnifying it and blowing it up beyond its necessary,0.28047934
proportions I do love the tragic ironies and consequences that come with that it is,0.055355918
truly remarkable when it sees that element of the artistic process and how it could,0.011806345
be misconstrued but also there one moment that I will say is that it deals,0.015675053
a lot with memory if you have anybody who is older in your life who,0.13672784
is struggling with memory who is struggling with that know losing their memory or potentially,0.021806715
facing Alzheimer's yeah the ending is gonna get you well actually most of this movie,0.07073496
will get to you I love that Pixar doesn't balk away from that sadness I,0.032316618
don't think they pull their punches here I don't think the punch quite hits as,0.082643084
hard as it does for Toy Story 3 or wall-e or there's a couple movies,0.05000252
that will have harder inside out personally for me especially ratatouille if you understand the,0.13104516
ending coming as a critic that you get why that one cuts but at the,0.06590906
same time for Coco there are elements I'm not sure it hits entirely as deeply,0.038587302
because again when you're dealing with the real life and the afterlife the fact that,0.026258789
they are able to give stakes to the afterlife part of the movie is impressive,0.026523532
but at the same time it does slightly undercut the possibilities especially when memory becomes,0.0260446
so much of the key of this story but at the same time for a,0.011562222
kids movie for a movie in this vein that can still be very much enjoyed,0.18718667
and appreciated by adults especially given the audience that it's pitched to I can see,0.013517862
this being really powerful and really resonating for me I might not love it the,0.075632714
same way but again I can appreciate the audience that will it's a light a,0.011107236
tight n definitely recommended go see this film I think a lot of the voice,0.13358617
acting is terrific the jokes are on point especially the ones that are tied into,0.033418827
music and the artistic process that really got to me and yeah it is a,0.029438367
bit of a tearjerker I can omit that it's it's a Pixar movie you get,0.10930098
what you come for but beyond that I definitely recommend you check out cocoa and,0.029927278
by the way that title it might be a little bit surprising when you figure,0.035828788
out why it's called that until you realize that cocoa is the emotional locus of,0.011963327
really the entire film and that's powerful in and of its own right you'll understand,0.030133484
when you see it I don't want to give anything away but yeah thanks a,0.021554612
lot for watching you like to like and subscribe I'd be more than grateful if,0.0134240715
