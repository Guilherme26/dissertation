Marquis underway here reviewing mad max fury road starring Tom Hardy and charlize theron and it's directed by George Miller now this movie was a blast,0.1745285
I must say the action was non-stop for about an hour and a half is this non-stop action,0.12110964
the first 30 minutes of the movie basically sets up the plot basically the bad guy this once against this truck from point A to point B because it has his wives,0.149046
but the truck decides to go a different way,0.074721545
and since it's off course,0.06923241
the bad guy wants to go follow the truck which is a driven by charlize theron,0.24207723
and i must say her character was very strong you think since the movie is called Mad Max at the movie would revolve around max,0.16768652
but I wouldn't say that he's the main character I would see that furiosa played by Charlize Theron,0.10388411
she's really the one in charge during the whole movie you know that's really unique to see I haven't seen a Sean female lead character and action movie probably since the Terminator,0.0786481
I haven't really seen speed,0.07719309
so I can't really give you that perspective,0.10519952
but probably since Terminator I haven't seen a very strong one,0.05074664
and this girl she just does it to the max even the wives that the bad guy trying to get back,0.2566259
I wrong to one of them's even pregnant and she puts up a fight with a max,0.31089434
so that's really interesting to see I'm still trying to figure our pregnant woman could do a hand-to-hand fight,0.27949739
but all in all you know it's really you know unique,0.071852654
and but this movie was a non-stop action thriller to be honest with you,0.19534695
it's probably like a 20 minute fight scene then like a five-minute break just to help the story develop a little bit more there will be another 20 million fight scene or whatever and that just really that was really fun,0.08264856
no,0.06626663
he has people playing the guitars that people be in drums during the whole fight scenes,0.11776376
and all that fun stuff,0.0818269
you know it was really just refreshing and energize me is maybe one day you know watch the movie I felt more engaged if all that happening and ninety percent of this movie's practical effects,0.113414265
so people are doing these death defying stunts and I really expect that it takes a lot of strength and a lot of energy just for your body to handle that if them for them to do it for what it seemed like one take because it seems like they really her Steve scenes because they're just so precise and you know if you did this multiple times there will be a lot of quick edits and things of that nature,0.101308405
but there really weren't you know the quick cuts to meat eaters seem like they're showing a different angle like they were filming at the same time,0.080328874
but it was just a camera over here that just happened to be playing while I was going on so you know it's really energizing to see that too one scene I was kind of made there to help the story go along I'm kind of felt a little bit too long,0.06728924
but then when you heard it for me contact me,0.053036958
I'll move you a little bit but also engaged because you know the facing at the end it was really worth to wait you see the explosions and people wanted the big long poles kinda like what they showed in a trailer,0.15376055
really now in order to prepare for this movie I saw all three Mad Max movies to prepare for this event today I saw the first one on Monday I thought it was okay I saw the second one road warrior I thought I was amazing non-stop action kind of like this one,0.13474558
and I saw the third one which I actually cut off but I kind of got bored but on this movie really reminded me of the second one this may be the second best movie in the Mad,0.17105195
Max Cuadrilla d,0.08805982
