"Okay, wow, Okay, this is something a lot harder than I thought it would"
This is not okay
"Hey guys, it's Alexis aka Lexi here with you today with another video"
"So today we are going to be watching inside out, so I decided I wanted to do an animated movie for today and I wanted to be Pixar, and said, like fully animated"
"These Pixar is kind of the same thing, but different"
"Um, I chose inside out because you guys have recommended it and I was like Okay, let's watch inside out"
"Um, I'm excited to watch inside out today with with all of you for all of you who are watching with Premiere, Hi, since I'm premiering the song video Hi, I hope you enjoyed watching this with me and feel free to comment like live chat whilst watching, Because I'm going to be watching it with you, so I'll probably respond to your comments anyway"
"Um, anyways, for those of you, not hello again anyway, Um, so we're going to be watching Inside out"
"Last video was Descendants 2, which was extremely fun to watch"
It's going to be fun to edit
so please check it out if you haven't
because I love descendants too
"so um, yeah, anyway, let's get into this video"
This is all about inside out
I'm not going to waste more of your time
"Let's go Wow, I love the animation that looks really cool"
That looks really cool like little fuzz balls
I don't know what the texture is
It's interesting and there she was
"Oh, that's so sweet"
That's the cutest thing
"Wow, Okay, that looks so cool and I'm also loving the score"
It's like so emotional and sweet
I mean
of course this books are
wow
I love the animation
Just Riley and me forever For 33 seconds I'm sadness
"Oh hello, I, I'm joy"
"So can I just if you could, I love how her first two emotions were joy and sadness, and like with joy come Stannis, I like that and that's it"
We love our girl and she's got great friends and a great house
"Things couldn't be better after all, Riley's 11"
"Now what could happen? Okay, not what I had in mind"
"How do you guys know know about this move? Have you not like paying attention? San Francisco? California, Tell me how I just found out that San Francisco is in California"
I feel dumb for not knowing that is that common knowledge
because I did not know that here's our new house That is so small
That is so disappointing of a house
I would hate that
let's go get our stopper in the moving van
All right
Goodbye
"Well, guess what"
the moving van won't be here until Thursday
You're kidding
everything seems to be going wrong and Joy is just trying to hold on like crazy
"See you, sweetie"
Dad just left us
"Oh, he doesn't love us anymore"
That's sad
I should drive right joy
"What are you doing? Uh, I love this"
I'm only a few minutes in and I'm loving
Like the symbolism
What the heck is that? it's broccoli on pizza? That's it
I'm done
Congratulations San Francisco
you've ruined pizza
"Okay, I'm loving the lions, and now you crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life's problems"
"Okay, you know what, love and sadness relatability right now"
"Oh, come on, it could be worse"
"Yeah, joy"
we could be lying on the dirty floor in a bag
I guess all I really want to say is thank you
"Huh, you know, through all this confusion you've stayed well"
you've stayed our happy girl
Your dad's under a lot
"Okay, That is so not a good thing to tell your daughter"
Smiling
It would be a big help
That is
"No for him right, no, Oh, that's that's upsetting me to my core"
"Yeah, sure, honestly, guys, I'm kind of relating a bit too much like"
"I'm feeling a bit too much, relating a bit too much to sadness"
"and like, after some I've gone through, I just know that you cannot say that to someone because it just it's going to hurt them a lot more trying, forcing themselves to be happy, trying to put a smile on their face"
"It's just it's so not good and it's so straining on that person, their body and mind and I, I hate that I'm actually really connected to what this movie is trying to do with Joy being really pushy"
She honestly seems like the villain of this movie
"So far, Okay, I really like that song"
"That, Like gentle music"
It's I don't know why it's making me emotional like I'm preparing my body for what's gonna come
"You know, I'm gonna make sure that tomorrow is another great day"
I promise today wasn't even a good day
How can you make sure tomorrow's a good day? That's my thing
"Did you see that look? They're judging us, but everything's different now"
"Okay, this is so sad and so hard to watch"
"Okay, I don't know"
Imagine being the king of guys
That's a core memory
Joy is legit
the villain of this movie
Like what the hell? You're not in headquarters without you? Riley can't be happy
"Honestly, I feel like you're describing depression"
She has no identity and no hap
"like no way feeling happy, Because Joy's gone, her core personalities and everything is just gone"
"That is, they have to be describing like depression or something there"
Uh-oh she's looking at us
Uh
"what did she say? Oh, oh, sorry, sir"
no one was listening
"Is it garbage night? Uh, we left the toilet seat up"
"What? what is it, Woman? What? He's making that stupid face again"
I could strangle him right now
signal him again
"Ah, so Riley"
How was school for this? We gave up that Brazilian helicopter pilot
"Well, what I want to know more about that? that's it"
Go to your room now
foot is down
the foot is down
"Good job, gentlemen"
that could have been a disaster
"Well, that was a disaster"
"Oh, my gosh, this mom is legit"
Like not in this relationship right now
She's not here for it
"Okay, that actually hurts"
It's like she's losing a part of herself part for personality
"Damn, I'm relating to this way too much"
It's actually hurting
Ugh
that's sad
"Why is this movie just sad without even trying? I mean, it's probably trying"
"If you want to walk the long way, go for it, but Riley needs to be happy"
I'm not missing that train
Bing
Bong knows what he's doing
He's part dolphin
They're very smart
Joy's a narcissist
I just realized that she's like Riley needs me like
I know she needs to be happy
Like
"But like you know what, I mean, she thinks a lot too much about herself"
That is my favorite
"Oh, it's so soft"
"Oh, let me try"
"Hey, what's the big idea? You better fix that wall or else you're invincible"
He just murdered somebody
"Okay, I like bing bong"
That's wow
"Yeah, I stashed it in there for safekeeping and now I'm all set to take Riley to the moon"
He is destroying everything like all around him
I would have sworn Sparkle Pony Mount was right here
"Hey, what's going on? Well, Yeah, I I don't know, Princess Dream World, Oh, the Stuffed Animal Hall of fame"
"Oh, Oh, they're tearing down her old imaginations"
Okay because it's old and she's growing up
Okay
that's sad
"Ah, this whole movie is just showing about growing up, and like all the changes, as we can see, in her mind, her imagination being forgotten, her memories being thrown away, just a lot of things changing"
"Oh, gosh, why does that make me so emotional? Once we flew back in time, we had breakfast twice that day"
"See, I love how sadness is comforting"
Sadness is like there's a use for her
We were best friends
If you can't understand that pain
"Yeah, I can't connect with people"
"No, these facts and opinions look so similar"
"Ah, don't worry about"
It happens all the time
That's hilarious
Actually that that
"Yeah, how about we wake her up? Sadness? that's ridiculous"
"How could we possibly? How about we wake her up? Great idea, Jordan"
thanks
come on
"Yeah, narcissist Joy is a narcissist"
We're gonna make her so happy
she'll wake up with exhilaration
"We'll excite her awake, and that's never"
That's not possible
"If you're happy in a dream, you want to stay dreaming"
You just don't want to wake up like
"I just wanted to sleep for 10 hours like I was not tired anymore, But I felt my dream made me feel happy, so I stayed sleeping"
That is terrifying
That's really all you care about Your friend is being locked up
This looks so cool
I really like the way subconscious looks
"You know, for a fact, there's like some badass thoughts down there in the subconscious"
It's broccoli
"is black, looking that terrifying"
I never hated this
I actually usually always liked it candy wrappers
Why is he in a clown jail with like balloons? That's hilarious
"Oh, because there's a crowd"
Okay are kind of scary
"I mean, I've never had an encounter with clowns"
I wouldn't know
"I mean, yeah, I think like some clouds are scary like"
I feel like people who make like some kinds of scary because they got a way to be scary
but I'm I don't know
I have
not
"I've not like, had a personal bad experience with the clown that you are making so much noise"
Can you not okay? That's that is concerning
"Okay, that is creepy"
Did you say birthday this time is freaking me out
I promise
Okay
"can you please stop? No, that's not"
it was a dream
This is ridiculous
We can't even get a good night's sleep anymore
Time to take action
"Stupid, mom and dad"
"If they had moved us, none of this would have happened"
I'm like Anger's character
"I like that he's taking control and he's representing what would actually happen, Like the feelings and emotions that would you'd feel in this situation"
Stop you're hurting Riley
"No, no, no, I did it again"
"If you get in here, these core memories will get sad"
"I'm sorry, Riley needs to be happy"
Joy is really pissing me off like she's really the villain here
"leaving sadness behind and stuff like that, only focusing on herself and wanting to feel happy"
"Oh my God, this is Pixar"
Did such a good analogy with this? Okay? That has given me some Avengers memories
That that Okay that scared me and it's like your subconscious fear
"Oh, okay, Okay, this is making me sad"
"Wow, she used to stick her tongue out when she was coloring"
"It's feeling like someone died and it's like just her memories, but it's like feeling like a part of her diary basically heard that she died and it's actually sad"
I don't like that
three tears came now
Oh my eyes burned now two tears came out Bedtime
I hate it
"seeing those things fade away, It just makes me sad"
It was the day the Prairie dogs lost the big playoff thing
Marley missed the winning challenge
This is a great thing about how happiness can only come once
"You like sadness after sadness, and like events like"
or it's just like it's Yin Yang
They both have to come together
"It balances out, which is true all the time"
"Though, if you're sad, someone will come and help you, But that's not"
It's not always the case and that sucks
That really does
"Okay, Gosh, this is giving me way too much infinity vibes"
I'm not this one
I'm not liking
It's giving me a lot of experiments
"Oh, that's so heartbreaking"
Take her to the moon for me
"Okay, why don't you fade away like that? Just so not fair"
That is so not
It's so not okay
This is shady as hell
I feel worried for you
Just let me go
Riley's better off without me coming
"Oh my God, why is that? Why is this movie just hitting different like Santa's being like, Let me go"
"Joey's better off without me Because you know when you're like sad or like depressed, you're just like you just wanted to go away"
You just want the sadness go away
You want you want to be happy
It's legit
this is
this is the embodiment of that
We can't make Riley feel anything
"Oh, that is, that's terrible"
"she is fully honestly, she is fully committed to the whole"
She's like the deepest sad
"she's depressed, depressed"
"Ah, poor rally, like feeling that at such a young age I don't think you printed enough boyfriends"
That's okay
I love that
I love the dedication design for her
"Yep, loving that, and we don't support dying for something"
"Oh, I wish Joy was here, kind of dumb, but I'm just saying in this movie's house"
"Well, what would you do if you're so smart? I tell you, but you're too dumb to understand what"
Of course your tiny brain is confused
I love
"I like disgust, like I like her personality"
She seems like that sassy friend
I think you're really kind of like
Mean
I don't know
"Like could be bullying others, but like, she's not really like that and she's not like a boy for you"
"You know what I mean, Riley"
"Oh, we were worried sick"
Where have you been? It's so late
"Okay, I'm I'm liking this so far"
The like ending and so I don't know
I just feel like Pixar's gonna come out and just hit you
"But but okay, wow, okay, this is something a lot harder than I thought it would"
This is not okay
"I know you don't want me to, but I miss home"
I miss Minnesota
"You need me to be happy, but I want my old friends and my hockey team"
I want to go home
Please don't be mad
I'm so glad she's talking to her parents
"Oh, I'm glad that she's talking and they're being nice"
"Gosh, Why does Pixar do this to us In that song we heard in the beginning That like soft instrumental"
"Oh, it's going back again"
"Hey, I'm liking this new view"
Friendship Island's expanded
Glad they finally opened that friendly argument section
"I like Tragic Vampire Romance, Island, Fashion Island"
"Oh, everyone"
"shut up, Boyband Island, Hope that's just a phase"
Say what you want
I think it's all beautiful
I love that
there you go
I love that expanded console is up
"She's um, maturing and going through so more emotions expanded consoles"
guys
"what's puberty? Yeah, Oh, it's probably not important"
Sorry
"Okay, I love that I love that"
Okay
"Um, Wow, tears came out of me with that one"
"Okay, That was something that was something I felt and dealt with with a lot of tears"
"Um, I really like inside out"
"I really like what it teaches you and like what it tells and like for people I don't know, like I I can like emotionally connect to it and Pixar is just really great at doing that"
"Um, I'm sorry if I wasn't like as energetic and like funny and silly as I would be during this commentary"
"Just like this movie, I connect to it a little bit too much"
and like I didn't
I honestly did not know what to say sometimes and like I didn't know what joke jokes to make or anything
It was like I was just like watching Absorbing and I didn't want to like talk too much like preaching this
So that's why I was kind of like that
"Um, and it's like late in the afternoon"
It's like what it's one
And so I am
"Um, I'm a little bit tired, but I'm not like that tired"
"but yeah, I am"
Um
"Yeah, I think more people show attention in inside out"
It's It's a really good movie
"And like, as someone who's like been the press before, that was like complete"
That was such a good way to represent it
"Like forcing happiness on top of yourself, Like being like I need to be happy and hating sadness"
Like hating sadness so much
thinking
"It's so like useless and it's like why? Why do I feel sad? Just like Yeah, and all the anger"
"the fear to discuss that comes with that, like towards sadness and towards just everything that doesn't make you happy"
It's just like
So it's so true and I really like that and I really like like
At the end They like accept sadness and realize that sadness has
like you need it in your emotions
You need to feel sadness
Like to feel empathy
"like with helping Bing bong like, I mean, my sense of empathy has grown, but also because of sadness"
"the thing, The things like I took for granted before things I loved"
"I loved even more like I loved Tv before, but now I love Tv even more, not being able to feel the happiness that it once gave me and then regaining that happiness"
"I'm never gonna let that go and just like it, Just like"
"Yeah, I am not the same person I was a year ago, but I like this person I am"
now
I like the videos I'm making on Youtube
"That makes me happy, like all the people I'm connecting with with you, So that makes me happy"
I like continuing watching Tv and trying
"and Um, applying for college To be director"
"Applying for college is so hard and stressful, So wish me luck with that, But yeah, that's what I like inside out and I'm sorry"
"this wasn't my like giddy up happy video and like you're probably not gonna like it, but like, I'm glad I watched it and said these things in front of the camera, Because at least I said it in front of people instead of just thinking it, so people know how I feel"
"Whoever does watch this, but I'm yeah, anyway, stop talking about myself"
"That was a good movie and like anyone who's feeling sad, I should probably watch that and get some a good cry out of it"
and just like enjoy how much you can relate to it and how much it shows that there are people out there that who understand you and understand that feeling
Because that is that is good to show
"Um, yeah, anyway, Um, veering away from that topic"
"Um, like the video"
"If you like the video, I hope you guys liked it"
"Um, subscribe"
"If you want to see more of my videos, I do happier content"
"Okay, I've done Little Mermaid descendants, one and two, Mulan"
"Um, if you need to be such back, Notre Dames like those are the ones that are on top of my head that I really enjoyed on top of my head"
"so um, yeah, like check those out, because I had a lot of fun filming those and I hope you guys enjoy it and it brings a smile to your face"
Like filming these
That's about a smile to my face
"Um, comment below any of your recommendations"
"Like I said, this movie was a recommendation"
"so um, I have a top comment dial pin, and just reply to that comment and comment below recommendation"
"If it, if you recommend a movie and just by commenting, I'm gonna ignore it"
"You have to reply to that comment and recommend And then I can see it, because I only look at that comment for recommendations"
"I don't look anywhere else, So do that and like the recommendations that you see, and you guys agree with because the ones with most more likes I'm more likely to see first, and like like, Oh, I should probably do that first because more people want that one"
"Okay, don't like"
"Like, Keep recommending the same thing, except just like supporting the first person who recommended it"
That's what I say to do
"Um, yeah, um, I really hope you guys enjoyed this video"
I felt like I
"Oh, yeah, I have to say something else"

"Um, I'm trying to post two times a week"
"So far, I think it's working out"
"I don't know that I'm filming this ahead of time before posting it, so I'm not sure if it's working out yet, but hopefully it is and I'll let you guys know if I'm not posting that week on community tabs"
