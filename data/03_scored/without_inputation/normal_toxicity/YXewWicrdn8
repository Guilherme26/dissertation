hello,0.05446308
everybody today,0.029480575
I'm going to be reviewing Citizen Kane this came out in 1941,0.31089434
it was directed by Orson Welles he also co-wrote it and starred in it and produced it and you all knew that this was coming because I talk about worse and Welles so damn much how could I not eventually get to the point where I had to review Citizen Kane,0.44372022
so here you go Orson Welles really needs no introduction at this point especially if you are a sent a file but I'll give him one anyway just because it really does feed into the inception of Citizen Kane in terms of his history as a creative person,0.09856224
he was 25 years old when the film was made but before that point ever since he was a little kid,0.12132217
he was considered to be a child prodigy,0.18734178
and he was very ambitious,0.11866764
he grew up to be this iconoclast who changed the medium of all kinds of different art forms you changed the medium of theater on Broadway when he went to New York at age 21 and did a lot of very famous performances there from you know Shakespearean plays and such,0.06283781
and of course he changed radio with his very infamous War of the Worlds broadcast when he was 23 years old in the late 30s and at the time he was on fire,0.15110983
he was considered just this great genius people bowed down to him and they thought he could do no wrong,0.12413365
and so of course eventually Hollywood called because at the time Hollywood was such a mecca still is but not to the point that it was back in the 30s but Hollywood had such faith in him that they gave him complete creative control to do whatever he wanted basically and from what I understand Welles had several ideas,0.05434984
and Citizen Kane is what they decided on but the fact that they gave him total control is just it staggers the imagination especially for somebody that is 25 years old,0.050653674
it was unheard of it never happened,0.13761589
since course Citizen Kane is known to be one of the great films of all time,0.10193814
and you know the American Film Institute ranks in number one as the greatest American film ever made,0.050189085
and so you know if you're a fan of film it's like the buy home American movies you know most really big film fans have seen this film,0.06890307
but ironically it was not very popular,0.0804826
when it came out it did get some notoriety certainly with critics,0.11593003
but it wasn't a big box-office smash like that Citizen,0.19540188
Kane is known for being very innovative for kind of breaking the form of so many Hollywood films up to that point,0.09244267
technically in terms of story,0.04496588
ironically I find this film to be Welles at his most safe certainly at his most kind of tame it's his most commercially acceptable film that he ever made,0.11339303
I think because he was such a novice and he really didn't know that much about film he was kind of feeling his way through testing the waters as he was making the film I think it only makes sense for this film to be kind of more of a blank slate for him,0.10019882
but for this to be his first big commercial film his first Hollywood film you can see it,0.07283479
he was just so beyond his years and everyone has tried to emulate this film in some form in pretty much,0.13012837
every way without that film movie certainly would not be what they are today,0.09413148
Welles is a very big personality,0.098700486
and he certainly has quite an ego as well and that really does come through in his films,0.4031081
I think because this movies just tend to be very very dramatic in pretty much every sense of the word everything from the very Shakespearean nature of the way that the characters speak in the wind that the dialogue certainly,0.088777326
and the strange humor the very dark shadows the gothic angles it's very expressionistic,0.24029782
it's very creative,0.06135596
and it broke,0.09843044
so many rules,0.062393524
I have to say when I ask people what they think about when they think about Citizen Kane,0.067585886
they think about technical prowess because technically the film was so innovative as I said but I think honestly deep,0.066574275
I mean below that I think there's a lot in the film that resonates with people because of the story the story itself is I think very entertaining at its heart is a story that is very familiar has very grandiose themes,0.060156368
and it is a kind of tragic cautionary tale with Charles Foster Kane as the protagonist people are people are drawn to drama they're drawn to excess and extraordinary people not only do they have big personalities,0.11032007
but they they are like exaggerated versions of us,0.15104976
they're they're very manipulative,0.27019045
they're very motivated by X and greed most of the time people like this are people that come off is very confident but they are often the most insecure,0.15391052
the most sad the most flawed people and they don't know how to connect on a human level,0.35500428
so they use all of this excess to fill those voids,0.2890476
and that is precisely the story of Charles Foster Kane in terms of his downfall even though maybe the film may alienate some viewers because they may find it a little bit too strange or maybe a little bit too esoteric,0.1188716
the film is a story that we've seen many many times and it's that rags to riches story you know in the case of this film you start with a very young child who is you know taken from his family,0.09289347
and he becomes a young man who runs a newspaper and then he becomes this very notorious very wealthy mogul glorified by the public and by the media what I love about this film is how the core story is framed it's framed and told through the eyes of the journalists and through the media that are trying to figure out who the real Kane is the man behind,0.10855691
this emblem of American success,0.14899296
they're so fascinated by who he must have been behind that persona,0.34690353
so what they do,0.06014357
they try to interview all of these people in his life like ex-wives people that he worked with and friends because they're just looking for some kind of key some kind of answer to all these questions,0.14995836
I think that's part of what the film is trying to say is that there are so many interpretations to everything everything is so complex,0.03560596
and in this case everyone that he knew has their own interpretation of who Kane was depending on you know who the person was and at what time they knew him in his life so who can truly know the difference between the persona and the man and that idea is reflected in the the way that the film is structured because it has a very elliptical feel to it,0.062729575
and I have seen the film many times but I honestly,0.023647709
I couldn't tell you how its structured scene for scene because it's not a beginning middle,0.1383236
and end sort of thing you know as I said it's told through the framework of these journalists interviewing all of these people and it goes back in time and then forward quite a bit when you've got all of these little pieces all over the place it's often near impossible to try to make sense of it all as a whole but even though I'm talking a lot about the story as a film nerd I'm probably more fascinated by just the look of the film even by today's standards this film just looks very contemporary,0.24194139
and especially for that time this was just a major jump forward it felt like in terms of how innovative,0.07648658
it was I mean the camera moves so fluidly and compared to so many Hollywood movies at the time where the camera was just very stagnant very still,0.062325995
and I think that people like maybe David Fincher might have borrowed from wells in the sense that when you watch a feature film he loves to make films that have touches of CGI here and there but he likes to make it very subtle,0.12367
he wants to kind of confuse the audience member so that they don't know what they're watching is real,0.1161038
and what is enhanced by digital techniques wells really was one of the first people to use that particularly in Hollywood as it was becoming bigger and bigger,0.10268133
and the special effects in this film are used so subtly to make each image work,0.07708175
and the fluidity of it the angles of it and the shadows the use of deep focus,0.07533421
it's just so complex and so interesting to look at and even though Welles was a showman obviously he was a magician,0.09590162
and a performer the special effects and the the visual style that he's going for it means something,0.055435907
it's not just a show for the sake of showing his visual prowess like his use of deep focus,0.114873335
that's one of my favorite things that he's ever utilized in any of his films,0.3230661
I just love that style,0.080842875
it works very well for him and you know it allows for such dimension,0.12342881
in terms of the look of it,0.04596054
so it's literal dimension but also figurative dimension because there's so much going on in the background to the foreground,0.07200953
it basically tells the story that the characters never have to say so basically when you look at a shot you could see all kinds of different things built around a certain character that might be at the center of the shot,0.09478601
that's a metaphor for the fact that there's so much beneath the surface beneath,0.067579776
what is said and what the characters may do,0.021848481
but even though the film is known for being one of the great films the whole time it obviously has its detractors,0.062358983
and there has been some criticism of it that the film has such technical bravura,0.046840947
but it's not matched with emotional potency and I can actually see where they're coming from because especially if you know Wells is later work even though most of it is largely forgotten by mainstream audiences he became much more mature as a storyteller as he went on like even even the Magnificent Ambersons which came out not too long after Citizen Kane that is a very heartbreaking very emotional piece that to me is far more evolved,0.10927038
than Kane is,0.028439008
but that being said I actually find a lot of emotional moments in Kane that really do resonate with me,0.05407855
when Kane meets Susan his second wife for the first time that's when the film really starts to hone in on something that has gravitas it's a really sad relationship because he's drawn to her for her naivete her innocence her humor her the fact that she needs to be taken care of and they meet Kane relates to her in that sense because he sees kind of a version of who he was when he was younger before all the success and all of that and it's at the tender scene and a sad one because of how I mean once you see the film and you go back and watch it,0.1296722
it's maybe very bittersweet,0.067995116
because you see how the relationship turns sour quite quickly their relationship gets to the heart of what makes Kane,0.10189827
so flawed he's a man who was used to covering everything up as I said with extravagance with politics with publicity and wealth to distract him from what he wanted most all,0.18825053
he really wanted,0.057858992
as we,0.03325544
all,0.036047194
do all we really want is to be loved,0.04771089
and he wanted to be able to understand himself but because he couldn't grasp that or himself,0.14070794
he turned outward for any means of control,0.0659134
and that happened to be in the form of Susan he starts to control her and starts trying to turn her into his puppet into this opera singer that she's obviously not meant to be that's when you realize how selfish how insecure he is she becomes his possession essentially that really reflects,0.45264402
what happened,0.05228998
so many marriages and relationships,0.051793598
if you can't understand the person that you're with you try to turn them into a version of yourself,0.43158162
or the person you were or the person that you want to be as the film goes on it unmasks this kind of male dominant man that depends on prowess and that public persona of course I can't talk about Citizen Kane without mentioning one of the most famous devices utilized in American movie history,0.09421269
and that of course is the famous rosebud which the film is built around rosebud at its most basic level is a metaphor for nostalgia,0.05365137
for the innocence of chav of childhood that was taken away from him,0.0795803
but I don't know,0.08970421
if I buy into the idea that rosebud should be this MacGuffin,0.115855455
that's supposed to represent the point of the film because I think that that's too simplistic,0.08884267
it's certainly way too simplistic for Welles,0.13833484
I don't think that he saw it as a powerful device either even when he was making it,0.07810385
I think he found it amusing and used it as a joke in an interview,0.15138702
he once called it a tawdry device a dollar book Freudian gag and he wasn't very proud of it what I think is a much more powerful metaphor and one that works much better would be the idea of the puzzle pieces because you see puzzle pieces used throughout the film all the time that's just far more effective as a device because it represents this tapestry of elements that we are trying to fit together in order to understand life people focus on rosebud because it's clear,0.12128505
and it's easy rosebud to me is that joke on the audience because obviously there's much more to the film than that,0.07454638
and obviously you can't sum up a single memory or a man's life with just one word as I said I really admire this film a lot obviously but I don't think it's the best film ever made,0.11146107
I don't think you can really say that there is one film that is the greatest film ever made just like you can't say there's one piece of music that's the best music ever made there's no such thing,0.084228754
it's all up to interpretation Welles made,0.05568239
so many interesting films that push the envelope way harder,0.12660842
I mean my favorite film of his is the trial masterpiece not an easy one to understand and I don't recommend it to people unless you're of course in a file but it is same with the films like f-for fake he he did,0.31089434
so many amazing works but I think the reasons this and Cain has enjoyed is because it's that balance between maybe a more esoteric style that pushed the boundaries and something that was mainstream that people could latch on to in terms of the core story,0.048739433
it has an accessibility that films that I think are far better do not have like as I said the trial or a film like wings of desire or The Passion of Joan of Arc to me I think are far better films but they just don't have that accessibility,0.09214986
and I know a lot of times I always say that I'm against accessibility but I think at a certain point in order to you know as I said bring people together and have something resonate and be there as maybe a benchmark that people can emulate or try to be inspired by you need to have that to be able to further the medium of film or whatever medium we're talking about,0.08685791
so in that sense,0.06903827
I think Citizen Kane is really wonderful and should be studied and it is greatly admired,0.35932896
and it's also a really just it's a good film it's entertaining,0.13441709
it's a great story and that is my review,0.047484085
