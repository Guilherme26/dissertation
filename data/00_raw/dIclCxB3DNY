it was a great movie that's all you need to know welcome back today we're talking about a star is born at my school there was a pretty screening for the movie so as you know the movies coming out on October 5th so we're gonna talk about the movie plot a review of the movie and there's gonna be a lot of spoilers I'm not a movie critic so I'm not gonna use official terms like the rising action and stuff so I'm just gonna talk out of my ass basically so the very beginning of the movie started out with Bradley Cooper who plays my god what was his name Jackson me so Bradley Cooper plays Jackson main who is a country singer as and that's like we see within the first few minutes he is obviously an alcoholic and he is constantly taking pills before and after his show and then after his show he wants to go drink some more he's out of liquor so he ends up going to I thought it was pretty obvious that he was an alcoholic to begin with but so basically afterwards he goes to a bar and it's a drag night at the bar and there's lady gaga and she was performing La Vie en Rose which is a good song and basically she falls in love with her boys FY Lady Gaga's not playing a drag queen that she just happened to be like performing there that night also anyway so he falls in love with her and then he was like dude that was resin this start they have chemistry and then like you can see like oh my gosh it's gonna be an epic love story so then afterwards they go to a bar where they Lady gaga her character's name is Ali punches this guy who was being basically a dick to Bradley Cooper's character and I'm like it's all cute like he gives her peas for her knuckles and then there sitting on a curb he's drunk she's singing to him and then he like falls in love with her like right then and then basically stalks there for a little bit but not like in a weird way like some other movies romanticized stalking then he's like oh like please come to my show and then she's like okay and then she goes to the show then he's like by the way that song that you sing the other night you're performing it right here with me so yeah and then like that started this whole thing where they went on tour together and Ally became huge but like right like in the middle of the movie there's just like this dark tone where you're like okay something's about it like get up so you can see that his drinking problem is getting progressively worse as they are following more in love with each other it's just like he was like oh like he's a drunk with that like they add character to like to that you know usually a movie though just have like a drunk be a drunk basically the humanized him using human we're like a lot of movies when they portray drunks they don't portray the human aspect of them so you can see how in love he is with her but he also is struggling with this alcoholism but it's not being addressed by the right people and then they end up getting engaged in the end of getting married and then Ali starts like launching her own career and then at the same time accents career is like starting to fizzle out and then at one point he even gets replaced by somebody else and then Ali has like become a huge success but also like her manager is kind of a dick and wants to change her and then you see like her style changed from was it down-to-earth country until I pop and I'm like she's even like oh we need to dye your hair and I don't know it was weird so she changes a little but then like throughout all of this she gets really successful even wins like she's nominated for three Grammys wins a Grammy and this is basically when the whole thing went to and you're like this is what all the like weirdness throughout the movie has been hinting towards was already at the Grammys and he had been replaced by somebody so he had to be like a guitarist like the person's guitarist even though like he was bigger than the other person it just like kind of hurt his ego so he's got really drunk then he went to go sit down with Ali it was announced that she won the Grammy but she goes up to get her award and he like starts going with her but then he stumbles down falls on the stairs like Jennifer Lawrence and like what was that like 2014 Grammys or something he eventually stumbles up with her and she's like giving her acceptance speech and he's standing next to her and he is so drunk and then he pissed himself onstage at the Grammys and collapsed and it was this whole dramatic thing they carried him out and he got sent to rehab but the whole time he's in rehab like Ali's still doing her shows but she misses him a lot like the the thing about the movie is that they love each other so deeply which is also part of like why the movies like it's great it's not just a tragic story about somebody falling in love and then like somebody having alcoholism and then like both of their lives getting destroyed which is like does happen but it's so it's so great like it's a great love story so he got sent to rehab everything seems great he's obviously like a little depressed about everything and he feels so bad but it seems like he's on the right track to making things happen and it goes home and now we're going to talk about Ali's manager which I said earlier was kind of a dick Ali's not the air the manager talks to Jackson and it's basically like you're a and you're gonna ruin Ali's career if you stay with her and then so what happens next was just like oh my god it was so bad cuz he finally seemed like everything was getting back together then like Ali's got a concert and she was like this is the last concert and then I'm gonna be home with you all summer because she had actually had a whole tour in Europe then but she decided to cancel it so she could stay with him because her manager wouldn't agree to let him go with her on the Europe tour and then so at her last concert he is this huge dramatic scene he distracts his dog so that his dog won't like I don't know do something and then he goes and he kills himself in the garage like he hangs himself with a belt oh it was a saddest scene ever like everybody in like my school's Little Theater was like and then like you could audibly hear people like starting to cry and then it's just so sad because afterwards it shows Ali and like the effect it had on her and you can see how much she really loved him the way the movie ended was her singing a love song that he had written for her and that's just basically a short summary of the movie but it doesn't really do the movie dresses in any way so in conclusion Robbie Cooper is an amazing actor and director if you didn't know he did direct this movie it was an amazing movie just the whole time you feel all the raw emotions and it just seemed so it was great I don't know what's a word and I I know Lady Gaga has been like in TV shows before I don't think she's ever been in a movie before I could be wrong but she did she did it a really good job at portraying somebody with such raw emotion and just somebody who was so new and innocent to an industry and Bradley Cooper is really good at portraying a damaged person he's really good at playing the damaged person and that's kind of scary because you're like how can you be like that but this story is the type of movie where everybody can feel a connection at some point or another it's not just one of those movies that you go in for entertainment it's something that you go in to feel like to completely submerge yourself into a plot and really like become attached to characters which is what makes the ending so tragic it's a work of art I highly recommend this movie it's premiering on Thursday that is my review I got these awesome posters for free it's really a
