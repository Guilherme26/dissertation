hey guys what's up it's free - here and welcome back today we're gonna be talking about the favorite which I'm so pumped about because this movie is awesome it's weird it's kind of gritty you don't really know am I supposed to laugh at this is it supposed to be funny and it's dark it's it's everything that I wanted from it and more I mean you you watch the previews and you know that the gals are gonna deliver but this movie when you leave it I'm telling you you're gonna be like how many Oscars is this  gonna win because it is bomb and I can help wait to talk about it so stay tuned to hear my thoughts and of course cue the intro all right so let's dive into this thing you guys know that I love tea and whenever I want to talk about Old English Victorian all those things there's nothing like a cup of tea my personal favorite is green tea and but English tea times okay they're T's okay but green teas a little bit better so let's dive into this thing right so the movie is about which is based on a true story that I didn't know when I was going into the film basically it's about this this monarch Queen Anne and back in the early 1700s she was ruler and but she was best friends with this girl named Sarah Churchill who is related to Winston Churchill was explained sort of a lot in terms of their diplomatic excellency and so she's best friends with Queen Anne and honestly this is true story she had so much influence in court with the Whigs and with how the Queen would make her decisions and she was very dominant she's a cold cold person but you could tell she really loved the Queen but she also loved her influence as well so everything's getting along real well and things are going great until she finds out that her cousin whom she's never really met before it's kind of down and out her name's Abigail Hill and she's like alright um honestly it's a little bit embarrassing that I have this cousin who is basically you know has a is living in the mud somewhere so I'm gonna allow her to come to and meet the Queen and become a chambermaid and give her a job so Abigail Hill is played by Emma Stone and I didn't mention that Sarah Churchill is played by Rachel Weisz and the Queen Anne is played by Olivia Colman and so then she allows her cousin to come in and she was not expecting however that her cousin would be loved by the Queen and then her cousin would it be just as cunning as she is and that's where all the tea starts to spill because oh my gosh there's just so much going on it is just it's just wonderful because they both want the Queen's influence and Sarah is so used to being HBIC like she looks at Abigail like she's nothing Abigale used to at some point be a lady but her father fell into her times or something and she ended up being sold to to someone else and she's no longer lady even though she was trained to be a lady so in her mind she's looking at the Queen and this opportunity like hey I get I could possibly get to be a lady again I get to be in the court I get to meet all these fabulous men and suitors like I'm not gonna just sit here and let Sara run all over me and and not take hold of the opportunity and at first she's really loyal because she thinks that sara is a good person but she's not and then it all unfolds and unravels and I will leave it there because seriously guys this drama I was thinking this could have been like a 10 part series it's fascinating it's so good so let's get to the performances like if Olivia Colman does not win Best Actress I'll be shocked I mean not only her performance in terms of emotion vocally like a lot of her bodily performance was impressive as well because Queen Anne had issues with gout she had a stroke and a lot of that is physical performance she's also known to be ill throughout her life she gained a lot of weight later on in her time and it's just I mean Olivia puts on like a tour de force of what it means to become a role and how to carry it out on film it's it's crazy and then when you get Emma Stone and Rachel vice I mean they're just like butting heads they really play well off of each other the director Rachel vice said that the director told them please don't read up on your too much history on your actual characters because a lot of this I won't give exactly what away but some of its fictional it's just to play up how Abigail and Sarah butted heads but a lot of it's pretty true so not only is it is it a great film to watch to see sort of a piece of history and watch how it all unfolds and then also just the performances are incredible I mean I honestly don't know who's gonna win between Emma Stone and Rachel vice because they both kick ass and so then let's talk about the overall style and how the film looks it's strange because you know that this is based on a true story when I watch this I wasn't sure because it's so it's almost Tarantino esque in the sense that he will take a history story but he'll kind of like flip it in his own way to make it comical and you're not sure am I supposed to laugh at this I don't know how I'm supposed to be feeling but it's dark it's edgy it's so different than anything you guys have watched this year you guys have got to check out this movie wide-angle lenses lots of there's just just how everything is framed and there's these court and the costumes are gorgeous and all the rooms that they're in and the palaces are amazing like seriously go see this on the big screen so you can really look at all the details and enjoy what it means to watch film that's what this movie is between the acting the sets the directing everything that you want from a film is in this movie and I know I'm really selling it and I kind of like weird things I'm not gonna tell you guys this movie is not weird but there's symbolism there it's a movie that I think will be taught in a film school because there's so much underlying tones and a lot of things that are going on and I cannot wait to see it again so I highly recommend go this weekend I know these next couple weeks we have so much coming out I'm gonna go see mortal engines to night I see Jason mamoa and the crew and Aquaman on Saturday I'm excited to see that but if you're wet if you really want to see something different and it's not like anything else in the theater and I'm telling you I will not be shocked if this wins Best Picture it's my favorite movie of the year go see it and when you do be sure to tell me your thoughts down below other than that like subscribe and I will see you guys I'm sure on the mortal engines review if it's not too bad right hopefully I won't be too angry and I won't want to review it but I think it'll be ok so anyway I will see you guys on the next video and bye bye
