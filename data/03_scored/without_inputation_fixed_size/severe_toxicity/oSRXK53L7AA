hi everyone its Alisa and this is always in a mistake the place that encourages,0.04846395
you to go out get dressed up and watch a movie so today I am,0.13697727
reviewing the shape of water and I had been looking forward to seeing this film,0.05543042
for such a long time now and it really did not disappoint me so the,0.03516693
film star is Sally Hawkins Michael Shannon Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer and it's directed,0.033178695
by the visionary guillermo del toro and this is such a unique story but it,0.02367056
really does have a traditional fairy tale arc that's what it is essentially and it,0.013111435
feels like little bits of beauty and the beast' and maybe even ET and some,0.14922531
cinderella it's just a conglomeration of a lot of different types of fairy tales but,0.2137255
it really does have its own unique vision and to me this is magical realism,0.04776484
done right so the film is about Eliza who's played by Sally Hawkins a mute,0.05302046
woman who works as a cleaning woman in a secretive research facility in Baltimore during,0.27289987
the early 1960s she lives in a world of routine where she's been marginalized as,0.080529794
a result of her inability to speak her only friends are two other marginalized people,0.2926658
Giles played by Richard Jenkins and Zelda played by Octavia Spencer Giles is a game,0.014195019
man who's trying to find love at a later stage in his life and then,0.089335494
Zelda is an african-american woman during the civil rights movement and she has her own,0.08520803
marriage to worry about where her husband treats her more like a servant than anything,0.1267953
else so suffice it to say these three characters they really are so isolated and,0.05711067
they dream of something much bigger in life and so then one day when they,0.09322349
are at the research facility there is this new asset that comes and that's what,0.010052255
they call this amphibian creature that this character Richard Strickland who is played by Michael,0.06869418
Shannon had found when he was in South America and of course they feel like,0.023153048
they need to capture him back and this is during the Cold War so they,0.05925988
feel like this can be an asset for them and how can they use this,0.022974113
amphibian creature against the Russians and that's their whole purpose and bringing it back but,0.20749672
when Eliza sees this creature she has immediate empathy and compassion for him because he,0.08442644
feels like one of her own he's not able to communicate he's by himself he's,0.1858104
totally isolated and while in the beginning he is so afraid of every move and,0.05801133
action taken by her her kind actions he can't begin to show him that he,0.08774371
can actually trust her and what develops is a really beautiful relationship where they start,0.042322975
to communicate via sign language and really just through certain looks and gestures but then,0.040584184
it even goes further into this kind of romantic love that the two characters have,0.028600236
for each other and the whole purpose of the film or one of the messages,0.017017392
at least is that you don't always need this kind of verbal language to communicate,0.034780458
love and that often it's a gesture book that actually means more and is more,0.029648565
loving than anything that words can ever say and so it really does develop into,0.023951268
this beautiful love story which you may not expect going into it and this is,0.034870923
definitely the kind of movie that people are either going to love or they're going,0.06648178
to hate there are definitely a couple of reactions in the film where you could,0.11624217
hear audience members going and I'm not sure you know if that was an appositive,0.026721092
or a negative way but I'm sure that it's getting both positive and negative reactions,0.029911313
based on what the storyline is about so you know it was really such a,0.021319136
rich and gorgeous looking film the characters are well developed for the most part and,0.033228584
I'll get to that later and I cannot overemphasize the genuine and heartbreaking performance given,0.03577624
by Sally Hawkins so at this point I've seen most of the frontrunners for Best,0.021667026
Actress and now I have to say that I really believe sally hawkins deserves to,0.035395086
win for Best Actress there is nothing else I can say but fearless her performance,0.079210065
is absolutely fearless it's so emotionally vulnerable she goes to certain places in herself where,0.062561184
she has to be just so open and comfortable with herself and and she does,0.05922662
it with the greatest of ease or at least seemingly so and the character has,0.008654039
so much depth but it's so subtle in the way that she creates all of,0.05248166
the depth in this character and it's the performance is so much it's in her,0.030476054
eyes it's in her facial expressions the way that she will sign she just gives,0.12226474
so much of herself to this performance and I've seen her in several other roles,0.039924324
and she's always been grained she was really a claim for happy-go-lucky but this is,0.06387958
her performance this is a break out for her in a way that I've never,0.081509605
seen before she is spectacular in this movie and I'm getting chills thinking about it,0.059992246
and if she doesn't win for Best Actress I really am going to be upset,0.053738855
because she just she 100% deserves it and you know she really has to create,0.11462445
this very real relationship with this amphibian creature which I'm sure was not easy but,0.08100939
she just buys into the role 100% so everything about it feels genuine with this,0.031322833
relationship with this amphibian type creature who's certainly a few steps above us on the,0.09397315
evolutionary ladder so in the hands of a lesser actress the character could have come,0.07203939
off as a character caricature I mean you really have to believe this relationship is,0.02818516
real and true and I'm not sure that that many actresses would have had the,0.030944344
emotional openness to execute the premise of this story and with that said I have,0.054551046
to give praise to duck Jones as well who plays this amphibian creature and while,0.13555312
he is in this suit and there's some CGI on his you still feel this,0.058677845
kind of emotional honesty and I just cared about the creature so very much and,0.047456197
it makes all the difference in the world that this isn't just CGI you can,0.020334
tell that there is a human there and it makes that connection between the two,0.023268124
characters all the more real and if they didn't have that this film just wouldn't,0.02528762
have worked at all but of course it's it's Guillermo del Toro and he never,0.030263195
would have allowed for something like that to happen and in fact all of the,0.037522346
performances in this movie are just standouts and Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer they definitely,0.034373365
deserve the nominations for the Golden Globes I hope they get it for the Academy,0.13276666
Awards as well and they also provide some much-needed levity to the movie and that,0.061015967
was one of the things that surprised me is that the movie is actually quite,0.019021591
funny at times and it's funny mainly because of these two characters so Richard Jenkins,0.027359668
is just so charming and appealing even though you can feel this guy who hasn't,0.04321033
really gotten what he wanted from life and maybe made some mistakes in the past,0.029693797
and you know wants to be himself his true sense himself but this society he'd,0.05404484
that he's in does it really let it happen but the friendship that forms between,0.025781853
his character and Eliza is just beautiful and they watch these musicals together and they're,0.024168117
just so sweet and their interactions and then Octavia Spencer is just so funny in,0.03763742
the movie but her character also has so much depth as she kind of provides,0.04105713
this traditional love relationship and showing how that doesn't always work because she fell in,0.040970657
love with her husband because he was just so attractive and now she's at the,0.074557774
point where it feels like she's just taking care of this aging baby and has,0.093300655
to wait on him hand and foot and what she thought was love doesn't really,0.05771333
work out for her in the way that that she wanted and so both of,0.045805212
these friends are just non-judgmental especially Richard Jenkins character and just very accepting of Eliza,0.02776809
I would say though that Michael Shannon is very good in the film although the,0.01700409
way his character is written he doesn't really have that much depth so you know,0.0191972
while he certainly plays into the fairy tale aspect of the story I couldn't help,0.032924596
but want to feel a bit of empathy for him but alas there really was,0.03739064
none for this character and one of the most underrated performances in the film is,0.009841392
by Michael Starbuck who plays a scientist who's working at the facility and he is,0.03700816
very empathetic to the creature and looks at him with respect and wanting to actually,0.057380073
learn something from him but not treat him poorly and I felt that character was,0.05105484
very well developed and and there are a lot of great moments with his character,0.019519148
and I haven't heard about him in the film as much but he's just he's,0.024196055
wonderful in it as well and this film is just so beautiful looking this is,0.03633898
just one of the most beautiful beautifully shot thumbs that I've seen all year when,0.05779182
you look you go into the apartment buildings and they have this kind of old,0.07778125
opulence but they are deteriorate deteriorating with age a little bit and there's something so,0.054437965
historical and beautiful about these locations and what I loved is that the color palettes,0.03509908
were kind of all over the place but in a good way you might be,0.039995495
in the diner and one shot and it has this complimentary color palette of red,0.04917836
and green and it really was reminiscent of onwe in that sense and the tone,0.019621586
and the feeling but then the next shot the next scene is monochromatic and really,0.117635734
each shot symbolizes the state of the setting you know so when the film started,0.074456
I got the immediate sense that it was one of those movies that was just,0.037888195
made for me with the quirky and endearing score the protagonist who lives above a,0.043831613
movie theater and then this distinctive color palette throughout and what's incredible is that this,0.015771504
movie only cost twenty million dollars when I was watching it it just looks so,0.016710078
expensive rich I couldn't believe the budget when I have looked it up it's just,0.029126396
so gorgeous and there are a lot of elements of the film that kind of,0.019892316
reminded me of well and strangely enough in that sense of going back and taking,0.027664987
a certain genre of film from like the 40s 50s 60s and rejuvenating it in,0.014242913
some way and modernizing that kind of fairy tale so it's certainly not a Disney,0.03735339
fairy tale in in any way shape or form and it definitely Murs more of,0.028900899
like the Grimm's brother fairy tale it's you know very explicit it's very violent in,0.10740787
certain parts and you you know that you're watching a guillermo del toro movie for,0.10840232
sure when you're watching this it was just really great to see this style of,0.026313335
fairy tale style but done in such an adult way now I can't say that,0.032344554
every single aspect of this movie was perfect I had a couple of problems with,0.106928274
it some had to do with the plot I thought that some characters acted in,0.018721594
a very unbelievable way to their character and I know that might sound ridiculous considering,0.1135668
we're living in this world of magical realism but this genre still has the word,0.044136263
realism in it meaning that I can accept all of the magic that you're giving,0.044344466
me in this world and and that's the circumstances with this amphibian creature I can,0.10855664
accept and love all of that but the characters still need to move be motivated,0.013544469
in a way that they would act genuinely and I felt like sometimes the characters,0.017226927
said things or did things just to move the plot forward and I felt it,0.033296432
was more of a storytelling technique rather than being genuine to the character and perhaps,0.0121282935
when they were writing this they could have found a different way to get to,0.019032234
that ending I kind of had a bit of a problem with how they had,0.08037813
to get to the ending and also like I had said before him with Michael,0.042973526
Shannon's character you know he's a villain but to me villains really do have some,0.04561763
kind of backstory and some sort of reason for why they are the way they,0.030192021
are and here it really is like Richard is just a sign of the times,0.018961059
and he's this uber masculine male but you know maybe I just wanted a little,0.08038944
bit more and that's maybe more about personal preference but none of that should take,0.046133813
away from the movie it's it's so enjoyable and it's so beautiful and I think,0.09061198
this is Guillermo del Toro's best movie now I love Pan's Labyrinth but I felt,0.048841108
like this one maybe had a little bit more heart and it was you know,0.06494454
very much about love and exemplary of the times that were living in a lot,0.060294908
of you know the conflicts that are coming up in the film definitely have parallels,0.021320466
to what's going on in our world right now and it just was so you,0.053428214
know beautiful and thought-provoking but at some times and this is just another negative criticism,0.030253883
sometimes it was a little bit obvious a little bit obvious with the symbolism for,0.044307217
example you don't necessarily need to tell me the entire story of Samson and Delilah,0.06733122
and Delilah you can just mention that illusion and then people either know it or,0.01729544
they look it up after you don't need to have the like symbolism sort of,0.033928357
shoved in your face which definitely does happen in the film but all in all,0.26810274
this is definitely going to be in my top 10 list of movies for the,0.026125088
year and you should certainly watch it in the movie theater and now for the,0.02490115
green so for film and artistry which is how you know artistic it is but,0.01372806
also takes into consideration the performances and the writing and how it fits into the,0.020578122
genre I would give the shape of water and a it is such a beautiful,0.028347466
film with just knocked out performances like I said sally hawkins better wood and fur,0.0783154
best actress but you know maybe there were a couple of flaws that i saw,0.04900674
with this script that doesn't make it a perfect movie for me and then in,0.02596877
terms of watchability i would also give the shape of water and hey some of,0.027858557
those problems with the plot that that on a personal level just kind of irks,0.095284894
me a little bit but all in all I love this film it's one of,0.17373931
the best of the year and I just thought it was so beautiful and not,0.03670084
to give anything away but the last 20 minutes of the film are just they're,0.027033063
absolutely gorgeous so please go and watch this movie so if you have seen it,0.06308868
leave a comment below and if you liked the video please give me a like,0.08167657
and thank you guys so much for watching I am going to be watching as,0.019207843
many of these kind of nominated films or films that I can predict will be,0.029037261
nominated as possible just so I can be well-rounded when all of the awards fodder,0.05162158
kind of comes out so thank you so much for watching and remember it is,0.02193709
