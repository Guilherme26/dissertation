guys spend a long time coming Center hearts broken we've had our dreams crushed but,0.19784908
I am so happy to tell you that finally holy about time DC oh you,0.08567471
know I was going to wear this for my review but um it's just uh,0.08164645
yeah we're gonna just put put this back here yeah that'll do you can't even,0.18386969
see it anyways I word I have never I I'm struggling to form a sentence,0.06759225
that conveys how happy and excited I am right now okay it's like twelve o'clock,0.18513568
at night I've been up to six o'clock in the morning I have to wake,0.15292685
up at 6 o'clock tomorrow and I still have so much energy the adrenaline this,0.04811892
movie has given me so Wonder Woman newest installment of the DC franchise until now,0.15287545
a franchise that I thought was just slowly crashing actually very quickly crashing and burning,0.28225952
right before my eyes and to be honest I've given up all hope I saw,0.13871296
trailers for Wonder Woman I thought that looks pretty good kinda but I don't really,0.124754116
have that high hopes because every DC movie has just been terrible and everything Zack,0.23332126
Snyder touches sucks I know he didn't write or direct this one but he did,0.82144624
produce it so I was just like is go away but I just I couldn't,0.101945125
accept I couldn't get excited about this I wouldn't let myself do it because I,0.10311575
would not let another DC movie let me down just like the rest of them,0.1503214
but I am completely completely blown away what is happening where do I even begin,0.10220351
Gail gadot is okay so like when they first cast her for Batman V Superman,0.24212083
and everything I was like I don't really like this chick she's really scrawny she's,0.69542736
kind stick ish she doesn't have like the size you know the size the Wonder,0.15282692
Woman thighs shouldn't really have any muscle really she's just like this Victoria Secret model,0.4745009
looking girl don't get me wrong she is absolutely stunning beautiful but I just didn't,0.44605362
see that like Wonder Woman thing going on oh my god she is Wonder Woman,0.16994278
I'm convinced this woman is Wonder Woman she is an Amazon gal gadot Princess of,0.31394005
the Amazons daughter of Hippolyta born and raised in say mascara that's it that's Bessel,0.1513426
that's it nobody can tell me otherwise this chick is the most fierce badass incredible,0.56149006
woman I've ever seen in my life I think I'm in love she had so,0.29451734
much gusto and just balls brass balls but what I love about her performance and,0.5409846
just her character and the writing in general in this movie is that she's so,0.08931559
innocent and pure and just all she wants to do is help and save lives,0.074847214
and she has so much good in her and she's also just so cute because,0.084697515
like she's coming from say mascara and she doesn't really know what the world is,0.10404871
like she's never met a man before she's never seen anything outside of what she's,0.34745416
grown up with with the Amazons and so she's just walking around just like questioning,0.16270733
everything and admiring everything like a little girl and she's so adorable and naive she,0.4693191
asks so many funny questions and words things really weird please and Chris Pine is,0.06327912
just like okay yep and she's just like really blunt and innocent and just looking,0.27379268
around at the world loving every second of it and I'm just like oh I,0.115316875
just wanted squishy a little face then there's like war going on and she just,0.31089434
ripped off her clothes and has her Wonder Woman gear on underneath and she's just,0.16370918
like I'm not innocent I'm a badass she's like jumping on rooftops and punches through,0.61763453
walls slicing people in half and kicking them at the same time and I'm just,0.7247366
like how are you doing all this at once I can't even keep up with,0.10566899
what's happening right now and when that's happening she doesn't look innocent or modest or,0.14755557
anything at all she looks like she knows she's Wonder Woman she's like I'm the,0.25718334
man and there are times throughout this movie where she'll be like marching into battle,0.11714343
or like walking in slow motion into battle as she does a lot but didn't,0.053923126
like a really cool not overdone kind of voice and she has this like really,0.18655923
subtle smirk on her face which I love because for most of the movie she's,0.3663493
just like she's not trying to do it for herself she's trying to do it,0.14482076
for everyone else but when she's actually doing it she's like yeah I'm aware that,0.09482769
I'm the coolest person in the entire goddamn world I'm gonna kick some ass and,0.93232936
I'm just like yeah you are huh and then she rips up the frickin lasso,0.74518895
room I love the lasso of truth because they went straight-up comic-book cartoon with it,0.15403391
it's freaking a glowing piece of rope and it looks so cool I will say,0.7626796
some of the graphics we're not that great some of them were but some of,0.115073144
them were like I just forgot about them or something I don't know what happened,0.16189112
but there's some weird green-screen in this movie but honestly I'm not that mad about,0.15392283
it it's a superhero movie it's supposed to look kind of weird that honestly if,0.10477269
that's my only complaint from this whole movie is that some of the graphics weren't,0.05089688
100% that's it I can't believe I'm gushing about a DC movie I'm so happy,0.0638957
maybe maybe maybe there's hope guys maybe this isn't a flaming pile of garbage after,0.79687905
all just just maybe and I think what sets this movie apart from the other,0.077790864
movies and the DC franchise so much is the fact that this movie has heart,0.0714767
like so much heart not overbearing but just enough to make you care and to,0.07678799
make you root for the characters and to make you love every single character and,0.08337875
I think that's something that the DC Universe has struggled with because they just have,0.05069576
all these characters and they're just throwing them all in at once trying to create,0.4008104
character development and origin stories and all of that at once and they just can't,0.044467025
do that but in this movie they're just focusing on Wonder Woman and her like,0.13052209
ensemble and that you can work with that you can convey a really really good,0.10378767
story with really good characters with really good interaction Chris Pine I am in love,0.07106078
I mean I was I was in love with Chris Pine but I'm even more,0.08905289
in love with him now his character just had so much heart and it was,0.046901967
a different kind of heart than what Wonder Woman has and together they sort of,0.12200621
bounce their ideologies off of each other and it makes each of them better for,0.14993006
it and I'm in love with this man Steve you stole my heart you have,0.46277755
a lot of feelings and that's not one of the only reasons this movie is,0.09313209
so great this movie is a true origin story from beginning to end you see,0.09574772
Wonder Woman as a child as an adolescent as a woman and even after that,0.24563482
she's continually growing throughout the entire movie and it's believable it's not rushed it's not,0.10878894
too slow it's like the whole movie she's learning about herself and about the world,0.14943029
around her and about the people around her and about what she can do and,0.09061211
she's constantly training and challenging herself until the very end when she is just the,0.11680903
coolest so cool I'm in love with Wonder Woman I'm in love did I mention,0.16403472
the Wonder Woman is my favorite superhero of all time and if she isn't your,0.11083983
favorite superhero of all time go see this movie and I guarantee you will change,0.10883476
your mind I will say there was okay so at one point during the movie,0.17105508
I had this stop where I was like ah this is kind of a bad,0.19451761
quality that this movie has but then I thought about it and I realized I,0.094679326
was wrong and it's actually amazing but basically I was thinking that the villain of,0.1507732
this movie isn't really that exciting and I'm not really going to tell you who,0.10759747
it is because it's kind of like three villains sort of and none of them,0.188252
are really that like whoa but the thing about this movie is that the villain,0.16492978
isn't really a character the villain is an idea it's a concept Wonder Woman is,0.16544475
fighting the concept of war and violence and she's also fighting herself as well as,0.30702424
the world around her and the people around her but essentially she's fighting the idea,0.12223001
of war and she's trying to combat it with love which sounds really corny and,0.40728754
cheesy and stupid but the movie puts it in a much much better words than,0.8290362
what I'm saying right now and it's beautiful I ok I'm not like a cry,0.21397994
person like when I watch movies I don't usually cry I could probably name for,0.1077589
you like three movies off the top of my head that I've actually cried during,0.31089434
and I'll say I like teared up a little bit I didn't cry correct but,0.09474409
there were a significant amounts of liquid in my eyeballs during like at least four,0.15100984
different scenes during this movie like it's who it'll get you especially all of the,0.14606895
like subtleties about war and just soldiers in general there's so many just really small,0.12597153
tender moments and very subtle moments where just like this is an accurate representation of,0.049301915
war and how it affects people and how it traumatizes people and it is real,0.34040067
and it's amazing how well this movie portrays that without like shoving it in your,0.19933511
face and making you like terrified even though it is terrifying but I don't know,0.19538166
come on oh this movie just shows that beautifully you just got to see it,0.2349699
another thing I was worried about was the slow-motion anything Zack Snyder touches in any,0.17144072
DC movie that I've seen so far for some reason they just want to put,0.09177054
slow-motion in everything and I was worried they were going to do that in this,0.092621416
movie and they do but there's a but it's not really until the end of,0.043219674
the movie that you realize the reason that they're doing this is to show you,0.09454007
what things look like from Diana's perspective because she's like super fast like she's so,0.11321127
fat she's like the freaking flash so when there's action sequences where she's doing all,0.69542736
kinds of cool badass they put it in slow motion to show like her perspective,0.37366587
there's like bullets flying past her and she's just like slowly watching it and just,0.4460299
like this she's doing all these like spin split kick ninja things and they'll like,0.44334567
slow it down so it's all a that's my slow-motion interpretation and it is really,0.082394905
cool I don't I didn't really feel like it was that overdone I felt like,0.095281675
it was a tasteful amount of full motion and by the time you get to,0.06568964
the end of the movie you kind of realize why that's like I say often,0.1517767
but honestly this movie is so good it makes me so hopeful for the future,0.07095697
of DC and I'm so happy I don't understand how happy I am that we,0.15600252
finally have a good Wonder Woman movie oh my god I'm so happy ah and,0.11710782
it was directed by a woman just ban girl power patty Jenkins bah she's a,0.46539995
real Wonder Woman I got a second you patty Jenkins you rock you'll go Glen,0.18572517
Coco oh one more thing one last thing less about the movie more about the,0.077801265
franchise and justice league in particular okay so you know how like Marvel movies at,0.115836136
the very beginning they have the like Marvel logo where it's like like characters and,0.076669544
scenes and comics and they are like coming together and it's like Marvel you know,0.15103804
and talked about so the beginning of Wonder Woman there's a similar thing but for,0.09466419
DC and it's every single character from the Justice League it's Batman Superman Aquaman the,0.05493275
flash even cyborg but after they show all the Justice League characters it's only the,0.042629067
characters that are in the movie they show every single one in a row followed,0.06699143
by Green Lantern why is Green Lantern in this but every single character that is,0.029983113
in the movie even cyborg plus Green Lantern could it be that he is in,0.10539012
the movie my head's exploding I don't know about you so I'm really high this,0.3758735
is the first time I left a DC movie and thought I want to go,0.07706212
see that again in theatres possibly multiple times and I am definitely buying it on,0.04345159
blu-ray no doubt about it I have the theme song the one-woman theme song stuck,0.16085708
in my head you know like me a new knee knee knee knee knee that,0.20716967
kind of sounds like the Halloween theme when you sing it out loud oh one,0.1487992
fun fact that I think is pretty cool all of the Amazons are played by,0.046589833
like professional trained athletes and just badass women which i think is really cool just,0.41958573
had to just had to put that out there oh I love women well that's,0.207188
my review of Wonder Woman my very very excited exasperated review from Wonder Woman did,0.15081789
you see Wonder Woman let me know in the comments below what you thought about,0.1138889
it I would love to hear everything you have to say I would love to,0.1141014
discuss this with everyone I just want to gush about Wonder Woman forever I'm so,0.15203281
excited I'm so excited are you excited because I excited I'm gonna go to bed,0.3619366
it's late and I just have exhausted myself with excitement so I'm gonna do that,0.062334426
