you know I only got this jacket probably about a couple of months ago aberrantly how much of an opportunity to wear during the summer even though it is pretty lightweight,0.051979467
the funny thing is that considering that's got a military s styling,0.109564945
it's not entirely accurate obviously but there were some patches on the shoulders most of which I've taken off just weren't really my thing there wasn't actually American flag patches,0.08659331
it's kind of funny because I'm Canadian but I think it's about time that given this jacket I might as well wear it during a movie review and actually talk about a war movie for once,0.124226905
hey there folks welcome to spectrum pulse,0.07370928
we talk about music movies art and culture and today in another unscripted movie review we're going to be talking about the newest film from Christopher Nolan Dunkirk,0.08274765
I think if you take a look to a lot of guys especially guys my age in the 21st century and ask them to name a filmmaker for which they admire and like most I bet a lot of them would say Christopher Nolan and it's not entirely surprising as to why if you take a look at a lot of films there's a certain hyper masculine logic over a motion actually logic and structure and Duty over pretty much everything that has run through a lot of films and for a lot of guys,0.101453915
that's a pretty powerful resonating force,0.14194971
and if you want to all pretty much all of its films like memento and insomnia and the prestige the Dark Knight trilogy Inception even to some points interstellar although not really caused it to turn for an emotionality that anything quite stuck,0.10817494
the landing a lot of these films are based upon guys on a mission or on some sort of deeply seated task,0.15117411
and these are brought down by their emotions or contradictions of duty or living forces of chaos and anarchy,0.19646691
sometimes you get that defined force,0.05894003
I think one thing that I think Christopher Nolan does not get enough credit for is a lot of the definitions of character that goes into these stories the people who are actually facing the brunt of this chaos and raw emotion ality for obstacles that that sort of brain cannot quite contextualize the things that don't make sense,0.12527393
and the fact that christopher nolan can so candidly construct these characters even in broad archetypes that can be pretty powerful to tell these sorts of very structured narratives and he'll probably in section is the biggest example when you have all those interlocking layers of dreamscape nearly undone by that female presence in the mind and yet walking out of it there is some still form that that was more of an layer metaphor for filmmaking itself layer upon layer upon layer of production and scripting,0.100862324
so what happens when you get a film that's a little bit less about that script a little bit less about that architecture and puzzle box around it,0.08562195
but least on the surface at least when it comes to the characters dialogue and more about the concept of how the film is going to be structured and layered well then you've got a film like Dunkirk,0.06342959
and I will say this right out of the gate the story of Dunkirk from a world war two narrative is not an easy,0.06697978
one to tell the Dunkirk evacuation Rutledge took place over a couple of weeks of the coast of France coming in right after Germany has pretty much steamrolled through the majority of Belgium and France,0.096563205
and it's a losing battle,0.10582016
it's an evacuation,0.13812163
there are hundreds of thousands of soldiers that are going to be quite literally driven into the sea if they'll get destroyers or something that ferry them back across the channel to get to back to Great Britain and there are not enough boats,0.15526569
and the big story here is getting those boats being able to fight off the Luftwaffe and with enough air support and just getting those troops home getting them out of there the problem with that is that telling that sort of story over a week-long expanse of time that would probably be more suited to like an HBO miniseries,0.07631958
it's the sort of film that I think a lot of people would just say from a structural vantage point would not really make sense here's where Christopher Nolan comes into play here,0.05195933
and the big twist to how this film is structured,0.113558754
and I think a lot of people have given him a lot of credit for it,0.05634182
but I'm going to dig into Weiss both a good idea and get a slightly hampering,0.28518584
on the first story is set among a bunch of marooned soldiers who are desperate to get off the mainland and that takes place over a week of time then you have the story of a couple people on a boat a family who is basically going out and making one last dish chance to go out and then rescue whatever troops they can that,0.16560054
story takes place over a day,0.077795975
and you have a squadron of three fighter pilots that are going out and making a last-ditch cover run to drive off any dive bomber saying the Luftwaffe before any of those boats across the channel will get a hit or sabotage that story takes place over an hour of time,0.15825951
and all these stories are nested inside each other the week-long story then you have the day long story and then you have the hour long story here's the twist all these stories have been sliced up and placed somatically across each other,0.095320806
so the time seems to jump piece by piece by piece until they all come into alignment at the one point in the third act climax it's novel,0.22721294
I'll give Christopher Nolan that in terms of structuring thematically,0.12811711
it makes a lot of sense in terms of structuring the narrative,0.10774558
so that the tension is constantly maintained,0.08559399
I think it's actually quite ingenious in terms of being able,0.06328978
so that each story has an effective arc and arriving at the same rough point dramatically,0.053718388
so that you don't have one arc that is ended off before the other and then you get all your big actors having enough screen time,0.19401535
yeah that makes sense too I get why he did this,0.07090109
here's the thing when you realize that dick Euler structure comes into play,0.88043714
once you wrap your head around it,0.39328915
you're then starting to see okay you're telling three arcs you telling three pretty broad narratives in that broadness might work against the film's advantage because and this is where it gets a little bit tricky,0.17531683
because again this is where I was asking and why was I struck before Christopher,0.15458909
Nolan does have a skill at emphasizing and developing up character,0.08569272
and that doesn't really happen in this movie it leans extremely heavily,0.06719359
upon,0.051043227
the actors playing these characters of the farce lines that they have in order to flesh out some idea of that tension and hopelessness as they feel remember they've got no backup coming they have lost,0.15340194
this fight,0.12008541
they need to be able to go home and rally against and it that sense of hopelessness is palpable,0.1692005
the problem is is that when Christopher Nolan gives these characters,0.10282476
so few lines for all three main subsets of characters it can make things feel a little thin a little bit too heavily reliant upon arc and relying on the actors to elevate them and turn them into something more,0.12520671
now don't get me wrong,0.123994626
the actors really put through the paces here particular mark Rylance as that riverboat captain in order to haul people back,0.107544705
T does amazing work basically trying to handle that stripped down straight and proper common Englishman full that's able to make that one last-ditch effort really against everybody's proper objectives including Killian Murphy who shows up as a shell-shocked soldier and really kind of blew me away there just in terms of the subtlety of his performance,0.19218381
but then you also have characters like,0.059746817
Kenneth Branagh who you would expect even a much showy performance and he actually does its just really well in that particular role as that to your master basically now having to stay behind in order to reconcile with the Pythons effectively hopelessly at these people off and then you have the few soldiers that are desperate enough and really they have names but you're not going to remember them,0.113772795
and the one I did recognize with Harry Styles and frankly,0.06977365
he was remarkably good in the terms of a role that ya requires him to emote and pushes his character into some dark territory,0.09315186
but at the same time like you and recognise that if you didn't know for one and for another,0.07650099
it's also a case where I wish his intensity felt more grounded in something that could have been explored a little bit more through dialogue through a lot of these scenes and through how a lot of this movie's visual language came together,0.0754572
and then you have Tom Harvey basically acting as the courageous British Air pilot and you know what credit to him for doing as much as he can where he's got a face mask over most of his face,0.12884197
and because that calls back a little bit to Mad Max fury road there but at the same time you've got with Max Rockatansky emotion was coming from a George Miller film whereas for Christopher Nolan by obscuring so much of his face with kids happening in the characters with his particular territory,0.15219712
and Christopher Nolan films it actually kind of mutes a lot of our emotional response when you're relying on him to carry an entire arc of part of that narrative especially when he's running out of fuel he doesn't know how much fuel yet,0.080233835
and he's pretty much doing a one-man flight in order to blow away and you look WAPA bombers and fighters and you know what I will give Christopher Nolan a lot of credit for how he films a lot of this,0.31089434
it's a pretty bleak war movie in terms of the amount of water and oil and slick gray metal shifters toppling over and the fire and again the water that explodes in and the amount of dirt and a Haggard desperation that translates through a lot of visual languages of film even in some of the big hero shots they do feel a little bit muted,0.10139216
because again this is desperation,0.117293075
a lot of it is very much,0.05958289
gray scented duty,0.0935842
they're trying to do what they can,0.048583835
and the acknowledgement that most of them will not get out of this alive,0.15308286
you could say it's a very British aesthetic when it comes to putting together a film like this,0.15013291
and the fact of this movie is so intently British and almost detached from presenting a lot of it,0.09905374
I can imagine it will resonate,0.061327003
very strongly with that audience my problem is that for as cleanly shot for as dramatic as this movie is trying to be foreign heavily as it relies on a score from Hans Zimmer that constantly has that ticking as emphasizing the background in order to intensify an update tension in fact about how much this movie relies on that score with so much of the film is shot with vast empty stretches of water and land Nord emphasize the smallness of these characters again Christopher Nolan's command of the visual language is good but there's a couple inaccuracies that got a little bit distracting not Elise being you do feel somewhat detached from these desperate characters these desperate men when they're given so little dialogue and basically a lot of it falls into,0.16459751
well we have to follow orders,0.045884505
we have to get out of this we have to go home and it tries a little bit to intensify the moral drama and add some shades of ambiguity,0.10545004
but it's a little hard to suck me in when you also have several competing narratives they're going directly full force with probably Tom Hardy's being the simplest of all of them,0.7675635
and while there is some degree of complexity again,0.06656131
it's not exactly as involving when the characters feel has been or as archetypal as they are then you have the baffling twist to go for a pg-13,0.09726244
here's the thing about Dunkirk,0.06854401
and I get that this probably makes sense when it comes to a Christopher Nolan movie and that he's trying to emphasize the mechanical stiff the duty found and yet there's no blood at all,0.10260433
it's actually sunny when you have characters who died in this film who suffer some pretty traumatic head injuries who get lit on fire and a lot of the injuries a lot of wounds,0.19342586
a lot of the trauma that would have occurred in this evacuation,0.0627935
it's not even shown and it does take you out of the movie a little bit when you realize that that does happen and it gets even more stark,0.17952901
you don't see German fighters in this movie and I get the reason why it was presented more as an impalpable threat,0.24062788
something that you know is there but you can't see because behind sniper fire there's behind a war machine that is just not quite there in order to intensify that tension the things that you don't see becomes all the scarier,0.28528222
I get that,0.05050769
but it also becomes the point where you need to show something you need to be able to pivot otherwise the tension just lies at a flat line and doesn't escalate no matter how much sawing on the strings your orchestra does and again when you have such archetypes they can work for fighting they are framed in a way that allows you to empathize the characters allows you to get a little bit more into,0.17940249
what those characters are thinking allows show a little bit more subtlety and complexity lean on that acting a little bit,0.18489651
the problem is that Christopher Nolan is shooting with big-ass IMAX cameras where Lanza shots will pan out to a wide shot and you don't tend to get those levels of acting subtlety that will grab but otherwise come through,0.5709131
and yet I guess that it's a war movie and a lot of these characters are designed to be archetypes,0.13215898
but at the same time when you have that there's still ways that you can emphasize the emotional drama in tension without just relying so heavily on the fact that this is a thing that happened I am showing it for you all taken and as you will,0.07768202
and when the musical score comes up be sad or be otherwise inspired,0.07303805
I don't know guys like I want to like this movie but there's a part of me that feels a little detached from it,0.09079107
and it relies like I said Christopher Nolan isn't relying on character in the same way that he's in with Cobb and Inception where he did with Harvey Dent coming out of the Dark Knight or I did it out from Gary Oldman's characters in the entire Dark Knight trilogy like there was an point,0.08937367
and I just wasn't getting it in Dunkirk the same way,0.057681646
I was trying like their characters that do bear mount there,0.052418586
but when you're looking for the thematic underpinning so much that this is just more filmed as if it is a historical documentary event with a neat framing structure tune or to intensify the drama,0.07084272
I can almost see the gears working overtime behind the screen in order to put things all together,0.04402198
but when you remove certain things from the human experience of what actually happened,0.117825165
in that historical event the mechanical construction of the whole thing becomes a lot more apparent,0.07676844
and that's when you go for the SATs soaring moments of human drama,0.18411902
they just don't hit the same way,0.09692688
they could yeah the score is powerful,0.06041698
but Hans Zimmer and some subtle acting work from Mark Rylance,0.10280171
and Kenneth Branagh can only do so much here look I know I'm ragging on this movie probably more and I get why people love it,0.11133343
I totally do because it's not going to make a hollywood-esque story of a war especially when a war scene that would not otherwise be covered by as mist,0.10377164
Oracle fiction,0.10887273
it was an American focus like I totally get why this is a passion project for Christopher Nolan and it's shot and constructed in a way that clearly makes it seem like it was a passion project but it also feels like it's trying to do three different things,0.11452185
there's one interview that I read that says suggested that Christopher Nolan wanted to make that a dialogue free movie and you know,0.046061337
what if he was going for that sort of bleak harsh tone poem approach when it comes to that sort of war I might actually be able to appreciate it more it would make a little bit more sense,0.14399521
but the problem is when the dialogue constructs,0.06977414
so many of these characters as archetypes and yet we're still supposed to respond and Cheer when you have big broad set pieces and get all the way further while intensifying this scenes of desperation of war in which there's no blood,0.20837538
I don't know I wish I had more of a connection to it,0.14446661
but all these elements seem to be working somewhat at cross-purpose and I can see the mechanism behind it so much more clearly,0.086675376
and yeah that does kind of take you out of the film,0.16683435
now am I saying,0.071517654
this is a bad movie of course not,0.18027209
I think a lot of the acting for what we get it is pretty impressive against Killian Murphy mark Ryland Harry Styles probably has a career in more movies good for him,0.15492682
he seems like the legitimate triple-threat in that regard,0.19097129
I'll give him plenty of points for that,0.06085284
and you know what as much as I kind of rag on Tom Hardy for not being able to see a lot of this,0.2443111
and see him emote in the same way acting,0.09875415
he still does do an impressive job being that stalwart hero I'll give him points for that,0.07572013
and you know what I will say the film is shot beautifully,0.08841769
it's clear that Christopher Nolan put a lot of effort and do this staging and architecture of this film but when you see so much of the architecture it doesn't suck me in the same way that inception did or the Dark Knight did and I can be very blunt about that as such as much as I like this movie I'm giving it a light seven out of ten,0.46418357
and I know that is harsh and I fully understand accept that,0.10190333
but I wish I was emotionally pulled by this movie more rather than just marveling at its construction it has emotional pull to it,0.06963618
but that's because just hold on for a second because I've read this,0.06628833
it's a John Keegan book about the second world war and it's actually pretty alarmingly comprehensive and describing all these initiatives it honestly feels a little bit like Christopher Nolan read this book or read any real study about what happened at Dunkirk and tried to film it as much historical accuracy as possible except when it's not nor to intensify tensions cousin via tease a filmmaker and you know what I get filming a book,0.11121047
I get making that sort of adaptation of real events,0.06686817
but for a story with so much potential to draw out that level of human drama,0.18893516
when in reality you have,0.08503818
so many stoic stone-faced characters that are if even the ones who are shell-shocked are barely emotive at all,0.1520916
it's a little hard to get invested in the story,0.06738127
I wish I could more but at the end of the day Dunkirk leaves me colder than it,0.1437401
should it was good you'll probably enjoy it,0.109224655
but I'm not seeing the high praise that somebody else have given it,0.06754506
that's just it sorry,0.05813001
so yeah thanks Laura for watching you like to like and subscribe I'd be more than grateful,0.0488222
I know this will probably annoy some of you again I'm a bit of a historical movie so I again I get why Christopher Nolan made this movie and I can tell that it was a passion project,0.12890375
and I can tell the amount of core to the story you can tell he feels a connection to this work an emotive connection I just wish that beyond the construction and beyond the obviously choreographed moments in order to trigger that connection that we got more of it and that it was framed better in order to emphasize some of those moments coming out of the acting which in the most part it doesn't quite do as much as I would otherwise like,0.07025768
I think it's a good movie again not a great one,0.14984688
but hey if you guys have any opinions beyond that happy here in the comments if you guys want to get involved in my scheduling,0.09786368
so I don't cover this movie two weeks after its release link to my patreon right there where three times a week you guys get to vote on my schedule and once a week you guys need to add records or movies to my schedule or details right there,0.046841744
but till then I'm mark you're watching spectrum pulse and I'll see you next time,0.13018486
