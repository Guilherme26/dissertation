so I just drove three hours total to see a three and a half hour,0.081049986
movie in the theater so that's six and a half hours of my time was,0.079513706
it worth it what does that flick fans and welcome back to my channel today,0.06645315
we're talking about the brand new Netflix original film the Irishman this thing drops on,0.10343376
Netflix on the 27th I fortunately found a theater that was semi closed to me,0.0677177
and I said you know what I'm going today we're going to talk about it,0.056764714
let me know in the comments are you a fan of Martin Scorsese and were,0.06411321
you excited for this film let's talk about it so world war ii veteran and,0.4755874
mob hitman Frank the Irishman Sheeran recalls his possible involvement with the story of union,0.23856647
leader Jimmy Hoffa in honesty time I love Martin Scorsese one of the best directors,0.07802925
clearly working right now and some of the best actors of all time in this,0.054261755
movie together I was excited for this film but not as excited as some others,0.15474324
because I was um I was nervously hesitant because of the integration of this D,0.077201515
aging technology and the fact that this film is so long it's going to Netflix,0.096690685
there were just so many things that we're making me nervous and I saw the,0.07692793
trailer and I really liked the trailer but I'm like huh I'm just I'm not,0.0629837
excited as I should be once again Martin Scorsese Robert DeNiro Al Pacino ha Joe,0.08147885
Pesci Harvey Keitel oh my good go on for days Bobby Cannavale II Ray Romano,0.100528456
everyone is in this film and it is a movie that is very long like,0.0736905
I said three and a half hours actually past that especially if you are like,0.09963117
me and you're just sitting through the credits go on you just gotta take a,0.29539543
breath after a movie like this because it really knocks the breath out of you,0.20358907
this is the story of one man's entire life not necessarily from beginning to end,0.0893512
but it focuses on the reflection of Frank's life what he did to build up,0.06581725
to that integral moment in the film and then the aftermath right it's not just,0.026679087
boom and the movies over no we get time to sit and breathe and really,0.07623596
think about what just happened it feels like every time we get an intense moment,0.0744265
and trust me some of the most intense moments you will see all year are,0.05803776
in this film we get chance to reflect upon it think about it for five,0.05282956
to ten minutes with our characters and let me tell you guys the acting in,0.0868432
this movie is as good as you were anticipating it to be Robert De Niro,0.09430099
is fantastic Joe Pesci he's back it's so good to see him back playing a,0.1410483
very different character normally or most of the time when people think of Joe Pesci,0.068686664
and a Martin Scorsese movie they think of the exaggerated and over-the-top character that's what,0.05312444
Al Pacino gives us in this film which is similar to what he normally does,0.061565805
but Pesci plays a very more subdued character he's kind of the guy in charge,0.16534275
this time and everything runs through him and I really like seeing that side of,0.11252354
him not that we're going to see him again in the future because he's been,0.17690176
out of the game for a while he came back for this film and oh,0.09111608
my gosh does he not absolutely kill it so those two actors were on top,0.6093993
of their game but my favorite performance may actually be Al Pacino even though he,0.06372225
is playing a similar character to what we've seen him play before Jimmy Hoffa is,0.036965128
a different person with different intentions in this guy man any time he gets let,0.14919242
off of his leash he goes crazy he talks so much in this movie and,0.54671407
he's always talking people out of how they feel and talking them back into how,0.17889257
he feels that's just the kind of guy that Jimmy Hoffa is and they even,0.1347782
say in the movie not a lot of young kids are going to know who,0.14329244
Jimmy Hoffa is after this film if you all get the opportunity to see it,0.089818604
even if it is on Netflix not on a big screen everyone know who Jimmy,0.06940419
Hoffa is because Al Pacino is phenomenal in this movie just incredible and Scorsese's Direction,0.079812005
is as good as you anticipate it to be now it is a different feeling,0.076709256
film it even looks different from his previous more recent efforts you compare this to,0.07202912
something like wolf of wallstreet it's like wolf of wallstreet has a very specific color,0.13518786
palette and has a very specific over-the-top exaggerated look to it I love that movie,0.06423642
so much this is very different this is a movie starring older gentleman it's not,0.08918723
necessarily going to be for the young crowd if they just look at it watch,0.06778224
five minutes ago it's not for me give this film a chance because even though,0.09947493
this is a movie intended for the older crowd or intended for Scorsese fans like,0.09814172
myself I think everyone can get something out of this film even if you don't,0.10381266
relate to our main character in Frank who does you know make mistakes in his,0.06411769
life and then at the end of the film he is reflecting upon this and,0.06623758
saying what did I do wrong and I love the way that this story is,0.07023071
told I love how they go about his relationship with his daughter even though they,0.22785147
don't flesh it out in the manner even from what I'm saying you expect them,0.13771443
to flesh it out but they do it very very subtly now if I have,0.10210609
one complaint about that story it's the fact that Anna Paquin who plays his daughter,0.10810294
the older version did not get a lot of screen time with De Niro now,0.05021483
there is a reason for that but I could have used more with that story,0.041501675
maybe just one conversation or one moment with her to speak a bit more because,0.087738715
we did not get a lot from her but that storyline was integral because you,0.11251587
continuously feel how he feels those looks just those really subtle moments that he's giving,0.064108185
his daughter all throughout the movie you feel that and that's what I'll say about,0.1547488
this film it makes you feel it makes you reflect even if you're not that,0.13339414
age and we'll talk about the de-aging here in just a second you're thinking about,0.072240606
your entire life this movie makes you think about death and the consequences of death,0.6297721
not a spoiler it's a mob movie but it's a very different mob movie a,0.09235344
lot of people are going to compare this to Goodfellas maybe before they see the,0.06729721
film and it's an understandable comparison because they are two mob based movies with someone,0.21443781
kind of telling us the story as we go along in a non expositional way,0.05513851
it's important exposition there is a difference between bad exposition and good exposition and this,0.07080161
was very necessary for this story but they're two very different films this one's more,0.059483174
subdued but when the violence happens oh man does it happen and the way that,0.11529044
it's filmed every single time it's just so shocking and we talked about the intense,0.078980915
moments and there's one scene in particular and oh my gosh man edge of my,0.15199682
seat we're already so far into the film it's already been the span of what,0.08242702
two other movies combined would be and I'm still locked in I'm still focused because,0.095667064
of the way score says he tells the story and it's also funny in the,0.05143748
same way that Goodfellas was funny the unexpected humor there are some lines of dialogue,0.062348723
and that are just hilarious from the smoke breaks that they have to take for,0.09062204
their wives on their road trip to the way that Jimmy Hoffa gets frustrated because,0.17748569
a guy shows up to a meeting in shorts and 15 minutes late it's just,0.092972845
constantly throughout the movie you're sad you're intrigued you're a bit upset you're curious as,0.120767675
to what is going to happen next and then you're laughing it's everything that you,0.10727698
want in a theatrical experience now to the d aging there are some moments in,0.053188592
here first sure where you're gonna look at it go I I don't know if,0.12318448
that was perfect and yes it has to do more with the CGI but I,0.053782757
think it's more of the fact that you are D aging the face of course,0.27323395
but you're putting that face on the body now they're obviously going to the hands,0.40333685
and stuff too but on the body of a person who is a bit older,0.44756082
so even though they look younger when they start to walk they're a bit slouched,0.4987257
and they walk like an older person and that's nothing against an arrow it's nothing,0.24004623
against Pacino but you could just kind of tell every now and then that he's,0.1630087
obviously not that young and I had trouble at moments trying to figure out what,0.09375129
age he actually was but I do have to give kudos because the de-aging is,0.04274087
so subtle at points that I didn't even notice it and after about 10 minutes,0.07221997
of watching this with a really long runtime you don't care anymore because you're so,0.3020549
locked into the story and you want him to keep going back throughout the years,0.15288137
and tell more of his relationship with Russell of his relationship with Hoffa and De,0.08684183
Niro is so captivating I mean obviously the best performances any of these guys have,0.18551911
given in quite some time Ray Romano as well and I know I mentioned him,0.051179007
before but I was just shocked at how subdued everyone was in this movie and,0.083657466
then delivering on the jokes when they had to and a lot of people are,0.1018492
going to ask since this reached the heights the level of what a Goodfellas did,0.109215796
it's a very different film that movie focused on one thing this film focuses on,0.051527683
morality and legacy and what did my life mean in the grand scheme of things,0.061890133
and how do I handle the passing of time there are moments throughout the film,0.04610673
where people start to not recognize those that have passed away a long time ago,0.15231355
man and it makes you ask yourself these questions too it's like what does it,0.107726924
all mean and all of this from another Scorsese my movie this film was epic,0.15067704
I'm gonna encourage everybody to watch this seek it out in theaters but don't worry,0.086712085
if you can't find it in theaters it's coming on Netflix like I said now,0.0555222
it may be may be difficult because I feel like a lot of people are,0.06963901
going to try to split this film up into like episodes because it's so long,0.0979225
and I encourage you do not do that sit there locked in get some surround,0.15158282
sound or whatever you need to do to get invested to get locked into these,0.31089434
stories and I promise you it will be worth it and I hope it will,0.15596525
captivate you I need to see the film again for sure because even though it,0.13435763
flew by I do think it was a tad bit too long and like I,0.104457155
said I did question some of the D aging effects otherwise I just I was,0.07117733
so sucked into this film I have to go really high with my score if,0.6659436
you guys enjoyed this video you liked this review hit that thumbs up button it,0.19216307
helps out this video and this channel back to the score 196 percent for the,0.081346646
Irishman my goodness what an incredible time the longest movie I've ever seen in the,0.067157775
theater absolutely worth it thank you so much for watching this video my next video,0.1542427
will most likely be a box office breakdown I want to see the report soon,0.05568081
Rick and Morty back again Sunday night you guys the best whoa I need to,0.14081703
