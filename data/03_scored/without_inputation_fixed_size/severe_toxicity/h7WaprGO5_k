take some patience since you have to read the subtitles after this the story is,0.011778407
a paste in weight that you're never bored while watching I was invested in each,0.05826277
character story and wanted to know what would eventually happen when the Raiders showed up,0.014104554
the action is of course dated for when the movie was made but I still,0.029086486
found myself on the edge of my seat when the action started to ramp up,0.035112385
this is accomplished by how well the film builds toward the ending climax the samurai,0.058422413
