us is a movie about a group of evil doppelgangers who terrorize a family and going into this movie I was sold because the trailers looks creepy as [ __ ] hey there guys how are you so let's talk about the film us directed by Jordan Peele who directed the film get out a few years ago which I really enjoyed had a lot of social commentary and I really enjoyed that vibe that that movie gave me but with the film us it's more of the classic throwback to a home-invasion horror film that references home alone at one point and for me that's the movie I wanted to see the movie starts out in 1986 were the events that a young girl goes through carry on to present-day now on a quick side note the majority of this movie takes place at this boardwalk location at the Santa Cruz Beach and it reminded me of another 1980s horror film that has the same setting it's called The Lost Boys maybe you've seen it if you haven't well enjoyed this scene right here I kept thinking about this when watching this film just yeah don't get scared [Applause] [Music] that's either the best seen ever put into a movie or the worst scene ever but there's nothing better than a big jacked-up guy playing the saxophone covered in baby oil and with that said I'm gonna give a big things to the sponsor of this video that way we didn't have to do this movie review in a cardboard box behind the movie theater so I'll be

epic champion as part of the new player program courtesy of the developers see you there not much like the film get out this film was also written and directed by Jordan Peele and my favorite thing that he does as a writer and director is he knows how to blend comedy and [ __ ] perfectly together those two genres typically when you make a movie that has a lot of comedy are scary suspense in it they don't know how to balance those two things cohesively and sometimes it goes too far one direction and sometimes it's not scary sometimes it's so funny it takes you out of the the suspense of the film but when it comes to Jordan Peele as a director and writer he does this and it's amazing because he can have you laughing your ass off or have you on the edge of your seat in the next scene and then laughing again just a few seconds later and never once does either see and counterbalance each other to where it takes you out of the movie no one comes to the acting and performances throughout this film it pretty much follows this family but the main character of the entire film is the mother of the family played by Anna Peeta and young go and her performance as this character as a smother was very convincing but she also has a dual role throughout the film and it's creepy as [ __ ] it goes something like that but I really enjoyed it and that same thing goes for every actor throughout this film they all have a dual role and they play evil versions of themselves now let's talk about the comedy aspect of this film and before I do that I first have to talk about the father in the film played by Winston Duke who is more or less the comedic relief of the entire film and at first he's almost a little too comedic he sort of comes across as obnoxious but then you learn to love this guy and some of the one-liners he says even in terrifying suspenseful situations you still laugh and then you get right back into the sea now no worries no spoilers I wouldn't spoil anything for you I hate that we have to say that in YouTube videos because if I'm going to spoil anything for you I'll put spoilers and big capital titles on the title of the video but anyway one of my favorite scenes in this film was a home invasion scene and it's bloody and it's gory and it's over-the-top and in the background there playing NWA and it's it's a thing of beauty it's the sort of scene I wanted to see in a movie like this and I got it and speaking of music the score to this movie is amazing it's eerie at times but it also has the ability to make songs like I got five on it terrifying to listen to during the climax of the movie and I really enjoy that I love when a film can take something that's everyday and you never think of it as terrifying and it can do that and now I'll never listen to that song the same way again I know it sounds like I'm praised in this film and maybe I am but I do have some big negatives especially with the ending to the film I'm going to talk about in just one second but first I want to say from a comedic element from a horror genre element those two things were blended perfectly in this movie I can't praise them enough and from a visual standpoint of being terrified because this is a horror film first and then a comedy movie second the opening shot to this movie where he had this little girl walking down the boardwalk and you sort of have this feeling that something Bad's about to happen and she's walking into the darkness this abyss where she's walking to the end of the boardwalk and down below you can see the sand and the beach sent chills down my arms because you could just feel something bad was about to happen and I loved that like that scene still sticks with me and gives me a little goosebumps stay on my arm as I talk about it right now so from a visual standpoint I really enjoyed the way that this film looked because you got immersed into these environments you got to see those lurking dark shadowy figures in the background but you also got to see everything that was going on this is a modern-day horror film that doesn't feel like a modern-day horror film which is the biggest praise I can really say about this film because it doesn't feel like a big bloated CG mess with screaming faces and loud sounds every time someone turns around this movie's nothing like the twenty last terrible horror films I watched of this year and last year now listen wreck this entire film I was along for the ride I was enjoying everything I was getting but in the back of my mind I was thinking okay please by the end of this movie just give me an explanation I can live with and and somehow makes sense for everything happening and do they explain everything at the end of this film yeah they explain it they almost overly explain it because when you're watching a movie like this just give me a slight explanation and I'll leave the theater happy with my stale popcorn a sour patch kids in my pocket but I never take the drink because the Ice Cube's melt and I just yeah warm diet soda tastes like [ __ ] but once again when a movie tries to overly explain itself you start asking yourself too many questions and all I'm saying is I feel like maybe they should have made the explanation a little bit more vague and small-scale and I would have bought into it a little bit more but hang on there's there's more that's not even my biggest issue with this film because at the very end of the film after they explained how these events came to be they throw a twist into the movie and that twist is a little too on-the-nose because they could have been a bit more ambiguous with it but they just blatantly tell you exactly what's happening and I was hoping for something more along the lines that we got in Inception leave it up for a debate make us go watch the movie five times and make us have arguments on the internet for five years to come to talk about ok did that really happen did that really happen and none of those things will happen now because the movie blatantly tells you now here are my final flicking thoughts in the film us I really enjoyed this film it was refreshing it gave me all these different elements combined into one movie and it did them all so perfectly except for the last 5 minutes of the movie but this is an ambitious film this is a different film this is the sort of film I think we should get more of and I appreciate that and I think Jordan Peele is a director and writer I can't wait to see what he does next I will say as far as a horror film goes the film us definitely fits the category more than the film get out did and I really enjoyed this film I think you guys should definitely check it out I'm going to give the film us solid B go check out the movie it's a good time now
