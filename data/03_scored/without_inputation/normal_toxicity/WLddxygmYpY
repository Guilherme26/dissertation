so the modern horror genre actually kicked off with medical living-dead which featured a black lead,0.31089434
but then the genre quickly switched to white female leads,0.3253801
so I find it absolutely fascinating that Jordan Peele has taken inspiration from some of those female centric horror films that comment on misogyny,0.37064236
I mean I guess in some degree they all kind of comment on misogyny,0.31089434
but still you know Rosemary's Baby The Stepford Wives they took it to the next level,0.070390984
and Peele has said that those were direct inspirations for making get out,0.09589563
so he built on those took the horror genre full circle with a commentary on race relations,0.23302503
it's pretty impressive like like is the thesis statement you're just blown away as that you can see where all the critics all the media rocking a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes,0.24147914
it was really well positioned to go into the weekend,0.05878115
but like many thesis statements while it's easy to wow well not easy but it's easier to Wow right out of the gate,0.047904067
it's harder to bring it on home,0.099289075
you know that pesky third act,0.24867897
and I think that's what really trips peel up,0.06288194
I think that it's weak and doesn't work and holds back the film from being a classic on the level of Rosemary's Baby or Stepford Wives but still overall very positive development for the horror genre,0.12100999
how different ethnicities are represented in film,0.094716884
and everyone involved with this production,0.06280302
so on that note,0.07871393
oh we just said that I am absolutely thrilled for peel,0.08613012
and its cast their talent is being recognized not just by you know black audiences but this movie has crossover appeal my theatre when I went on Saturday night I was traveling in Los Angeles for the Oscars Dolby flew me out there to go behind the scenes,0.14865531
that's why I'm late reviewing this,0.062049657
but my theatre was 5050 in terms of the demographics that attended and that's reflected actually in polling for the film,0.02638943
it was it because you're taking also Asian viewers and Latino viewers in to account,0.16347206
it was about like mid-30s for both african-american and Caucasian audiences so that's spectacular especially because you're talking about a film with a black unknown lead you know,0.3606799
it's not Denzel,0.06994079
it's not Will Smith,0.07815215
and also a first-time director in the genre who also happens to be black to have that kind of crossover appeal,0.050134104
it's been very difficult in Hollywood to achieve that so that right there you know is something that Peele can be proud of,0.06382346
and he has definitely has something to say I think the intellectual approach helped him and you also clearly loves the genre but everybody was listening and that's just so spectacular,0.07235751
and I think that well again this won't become a horror classic and we'll discuss the ending at the end of this review in the spoiler section but I think this will serve as a launchpad particularly for Peale and his star,0.14974046
Daniel kuya,
I want to make sure I pronounce his name correctly,0.2610284
now I want to start off with Pele as a director he's been stuck in Keith's shadow for quite some time,0.23145536
I felt bad for him,0.27559987
but I do think the key is the superior on-camera talent,0.1560352
there's just there's an energy there,0.04405544
but the seat pealed breakout a Keith shadow by going behind the camera I think it just shows you how important is to be able to think outside the box and a willingness to adjust your dream,0.055774394
you know I still in the same industry still doing what he loves,0.07870219
and he has now had a resounding success,0.0951158
and I think that while he lets himself as a rope down as a writer at the end of the movie and quite frankly,0.28778616
if he had a better producer sorry Jason Blum,0.10292014
the producer would have you know pointed this out to him and it's amazing fix the end would have been a very easy fix which makes it all,0.06671611
the more frustrating but his skills as a director are very impressive from the very first scene this camerawork to his use of music to his ability to make a movie that was made for under five million dollars look like it was made for six time that six times,0.09276876
that proves the appeal is a very talented director he also makes some really unique creative choices throughout the film which elevate it,0.037082996
and I would say he's the most ambitious director that Jason,0.09349095
Blum has discovered,0.10119471
you know a new director since James Wan and Scott Derrickson and that's not bad company to be it,0.117556736
I'd be very curious to see what Pele does next when you know what his next,0.08007309
gig is if he stays in his own lane or if he swallowed up by a franchise also to be fair key & peele sketches role is very ambitious ly directed so even more kudos to peel for obviously paying attention and learning on the,0.08958877
job I would also say the peel is up there with Kenya bears from blackish on ABC as a voice that presents black characters as fully three-dimensional characters and not stereotypes caricatures or having the burden of representing their entire community also credit belongs to Daniel,0.09240444
Kuya the star of the film who gives a wonderfully understated performance and you know with an American accent no,0.053348012
less he's from the UK he got his big start on Black Mirror over there that show came here to Netflix but you know some of his best moments came with just a look he's a really,0.08876608
talented actor I think his body language is excellent,0.23439856
and just even just what he can say with his eyes speaking of that Pele does do some good writing with the tragic backstory to begin Scalia's character,0.110345714
and I thought that kahl√∫a did a fabulous job bringing that guilt and grief to life you know like Pele set him up but kouya knocked it out of the park,0.12538356
I also want to give a shout,0.2012041
out specifically to Betty Gabriel,0.093242995
she said she stood out to me in the purge election year last year but to see her here playing such a different character shows what amazing range she has and I hope she gets more work as well the whole film is very well cast though and no often they say good directing a lot of it is just good casting right like if you know and that's you know people talk about us Tarantino right like if you can't if you cast well 90% of your work is done and Pele I think this is an excellent example of that for instance,0.07732615
he did a very good job using the personas that Allison Williams and Catherine Keener have already established through their other work,0.053198095
and that was that made both of them very effective,0.09119367
here,0.053441156
I also thought you know there was some comedic relief from the best friend although here the best friend and the lead both happened to be played by black actors and that's very progressive in Hall,0.3016602
unfortunately but larell Howry was the funny best friend and he did a great job I also he was huge just enough you know to lighten the mood just when it was needed but not too cheap in the film and also that dog quite a ball,0.14858952
now for the ending so we're going into spoiler territory,0.20123567
so this is a warning,0.18057513
and if you're going to bail out here if you haven't seen the movie and I would like just to say that get out is worth seeing now should you see it in the theater,0.09431125
while if you're a horror fan or a cinephile or you're interested in the evolution of how different ethnicities are portrayed in Hollywood or you just like to be part of big events,0.45659024
in this film has definitely become like a moment in pop culture and you should totally see it in the theater,0.11477667
but if none of those things matter to you then you can wait to stream it all right,0.097605
so last warning we're going to talk about the ending,0.102007374
okay alright,0.05690582
so as I said the ending was weak and could have been easily fixed,0.12316028
so a good twist is one where once you know it you can look back at the earlier part of the film and see the clues just ask em nice Xiaolan which is you know career-defining twist the sixth sense,0.036266204
and interestingly enough he's also been working with jason blum recently but when you saw this when you'll learn the twist in the sixth sense and you look back at the rest of the movie suddenly saw things with new perspectives,0.059066948
they made sense etc,0.061015792
but here when it was revealed that Walter and Georgina were actually the armitage grandparents you couldn't look back at the earlier part of the movie and be like,0.066881865
oh yeah that's who they were acting like grandparents,0.15840827
they were the servants of the house the whole time or they were like not there that was awful weird like as grandpa Armitage was the leader of this entire movement,0.15534918
why would he be satisfied going from that to this chopping wood and you know you know not really being a part of his family anymore right,0.10664078
they had a late night running which I guess was kind of a nod to his racing past,0.06527582
and I thought that was interesting that he was beaten out by Jesse Owens to go to the Olympics and that started this whole train of thought but what was he racing for to what end,0.074777685
you know the people who underwent this procedure never left the community,0.1203715
they never did anything with their new bodies,0.15046476
so I don't understand the selling point of oh we're going to take a white brain,0.6420859
and put it in a black body and the thinking here from this evil group was that both were the superior the white mine in the black body and create an ultimate individual but I've never saw a shred of the original person inside,0.45216647
there like you saw the the the tragic black soul you know struggling to get out but I never saw the white person that had been inserted in there,0.42059916
I never saw that person,0.16253674
you know it was always just like some unreal zombie like mode that they went into,0.3706854
I didn't I would have been much more interesting like for instance that guy was kidnapped at the beginning of the movie,0.09742384
and when he showed up at the party he I've had quirks and interests and genuinely acted like the guy you know that woman's original husband but no it was just he was like a zombie,0.4528109
and so I can't look back at any mom in the movie and be like I see it in a whole new light,0.12930664
you know instead I go,0.096808456
well,0.039254032
now it doesn't make sense,0.06577638
now you cut them,0.45945624
well what about Walters comments about Rose when he says all she's such an attractive young woman to me I felt and still feel that that was attributable to his black man's romances rose but he still you know I mean obviously if you could see from in the movie that was a great moment,0.40685907
when he shot her but you know there you know I think maybe he you know,0.5223205
I thought maybe,0.0566342
he was saying it like what it was spite like she was so beautiful and she lured me to my doom and I did like that twist,0.36286932
I did like that Rose was a honey trap,0.09934091
and I thought it was very funny when she was looking up top and c-double-a candidates at the end of the movie although again why bother you know if they weren't going to do anything with these bodies it made no sense you know the whole superior genetic argument like oh you'd be a great fighter,0.111190744
you know if the brother was saying to Daniel who use character at the dinner table but they never did anything like that,0.10714857
so you I would think they would just be getting younger bodies,0.27562463
you know who cares about the ethnicity look for people who wouldn't be missed and that would make more sense to me in this in the way it was set up by you know Pele and since it's his script he could set it up any way he wants,0.14189391
so if PL effects this problem,0.088648565
and then you could see that the souls of the people who've taken over the bodies as well I think this would be a horror classic that would last you know stand the test of time,0.16324374
but instead it's not going to however he was so close to a horror classic,0.18204118
I'm confident that appeal will get there very soon and we'll be seeing a lot more of Kuya,0.051884487
and you know maybe it'll even give a boost to some of the other people involved in the film I hope Buddy Gabriel,0.057700507
but maybe even Allison Williams might see some some reward for this as well,0.058194984
so what do you think what do you,0.08287211
think of the whole movie what did you think of a twist,0.13415818
what do you think of the twist now that I've brought up my problems with it,0.09575514
and what do you think of Peele going forward,0.057631534
and also what he's done for the horror genre and his commentary as well I thought clearly a very intelligent film it just didn't stick the landing,0.16587411
okay write your thoughts down below and you can check out some more videos right,0.25801086
