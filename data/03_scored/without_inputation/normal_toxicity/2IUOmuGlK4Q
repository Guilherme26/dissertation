Peter Parker,
you're out Miles,0.17170306
Morales you are definitely in spider-man into the spider verse is probably one of 2018 s most anticipated films,0.13084179
so does it deliver [Applause] in this one the villain inadvertently opens up a whole bunch of dimensions and all kinds of spider-man come in to Miles Morales dimension and they're all stuck there,0.11964506
that's the whole story now they need to get back before they die or disappear or whatever it does because they're not in their own dimension,0.30076814
and before Miles Morales is Chris reality crumples and destroys have you seen any of the trailers,0.31089434
the animation looks a lot like a comic book it almost has this 3d feel to it,0.17457055
because you have some of the color shifting in the backgrounds and then you also have a lot of halftone going on and so it really makes it feel super like you're in a comic book and I loved it at the beginning I thought I was going to not like it so much because some of the colour shifts really messed with my eyes but it was in the background enough that it didn't you know I noticed it,0.095371746
but it wasn't my focal,0.0932958
and so I thought yeah okay it looks like it's totally 3d like I'm gonna wear 3d glasses and then it's gonna have all of this depth no it was just truly to make it more and more like an actual comic book the movie itself is visually stunning,0.11053432
but also without being overwhelming to your eye I mean there is a lot going on in several scenes especially that climax where there are a whole lot of colors,0.101494364
and there's just a whole lot of action going on and really you could just kind of get blurry eyed and like you know go cross-eyed but I run the the filmmakers really did a good job of animating it in a way that still you were able to keep your focus and know what you're supposed to see,0.17632997
and as the other things happen in the background they don't draw it away but they certainly had to it,0.06584637
it's a great story and I love how they intro the other Spider people because they give us some background without delving too deep so that we have enough knowledge of who they are,0.1287704
and what they're about and their kind of backstory and how they are in their universe,0.09820903
but it doesn't spend a whole lot of time on it,0.06479945
I felt like I had a well-rounded just grasp on who each one was enough to care about them but not so much that it becomes their movie or their the focal point,0.11344352
I think one of the best things about the movie ins one of the things that I liked the most is that it has a such a great message and it really is all about team,0.055413768
and it was a positive team message throughout much of the film and I really appreciated that because it's you know sometimes you have all of these ego things going on or you know somebody's gonna be,0.08921921
no,0.06626663
no I'm the best or whatever it is this though wasn't that way,0.06080858
they were all working towards a common purpose a common goal,0.08843968
and they were building each other up and really supporting each other,0.06031674
and I appreciated that a lot there's some good humor,0.04707464
but it is also enough tension and drama in there to really keep me going engage throughout the entire thing it really felt like an animated live-action comic book that doesn't make any sense right that is a total contradiction in terms,0.08696259
but that's what it is it's just I mean if you think about it,0.07919691
it's obviously it's an animated film,0.18927781
and then it has this comic-book ask part to it but the characters themselves were so real not realistic not photo realistic in the CGI or though the way that they made them but just that they had heart and they had depth to them,0.056239102
and I cared about them,0.07942977
and so that is why they made it like they just seemed real to me,0.08888142
so there it is a live-action animated comic book,0.10575239
you know the movie is one hour and 57 minutes which is actually kind of long for an animated feature,0.084857285
but for this I didn't feel it at all I was totally engaged the entire time,0.07512042
and I think had they made it shorter,0.05118212
I probably would have been disappointed know are there parts that are predictable,0.104292065
yes of course there are,0.05592746
but the whole movie itself was so enjoyable,0.15404089
and I liked the story so much and the characters that I'm willing to overlook some of these parts that I saw coming because I just I was so enthralled in what was going on overall,0.055735692
I think spider-man into the spider verse is a great film,0.09084374
and I think it's one that everybody can enjoy not just fans of superhero movies or like the uber niche fans of just spider-man,0.16820467
I really think that it has something to offer to everybody,0.06380288
I mean it is great animation,0.10132185
there's good humor,0.049219135
there's great voice work,0.042934295
and just the the overall look and the feel is so well put together,0.08205742
and it is so good and tight that it is just it's a visual spectacle that,0.075790145
I think you should see there's no sex or nudity,0.67995286
there is a little bit of language and some animated violence,0.24100661
