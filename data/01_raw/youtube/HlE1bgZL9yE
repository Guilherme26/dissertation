I'm not gonna waste any time you saw the title clicked on the video so it's time to give you my spoiler free thoughts of spider-man into the spider verse for those of you who want my spoiler thoughts that will be on Mondays variant life with that said I thought this movie was a ton of fun it's a very well-rounded superhero flick and easily one of the best spider-man films to date I won't say it's my favorite spider-man film just yet as I've only seen it once and I'm a huge fan of homecoming and Sam Raimi spider-man 2 but it's definitely up there and might become my favorite with more viewings because like I just said it's a well-rounded spider-man film in a perfect family movie little kids all the way to adults can enjoy this movie but let's talk about the characters for a second the main character Miles Morales is easily the best character in the film at least in my opinion he's just your average good kid who just so happens to be spider-man and is incredibly relatable because of that his relationship with his father is golden you know that part in the trailer where his dad makes miles say I love you back in front of his school while his dad's on the loudspeaker in his cop car well that perfectly sums up their relationship and it's great mouths relationship with his mentor Peter Parker spider-man is another great dynamic because as you've all seen in the trailer this Peter Parker is jaded overweight and down-and-out he doesn't want to be a mentor to miles but of course ultimately does and starts to really care about him but seeing miles look up to Peter and becoming the push Peter needs to put him back on track with his life is really cool especially how it ultimately ends it was all so fresh and interesting to see the older jaded Peter Parker spider-man as we've never seen that in the several spider-man movies that have come before this one I'm a big fan of comics exploring possible futures for characters and that's pretty much what this was spider-woman or spider-gwen was also fantastic in her relationship with Miles was great as he had a crush on her but never really liked a girl before so he didn't know how to go about it I will say though for those of you who have seen the movie shoulder method freaking hilarious then we also have spider-man you are spider-ham and Penny Parker they are all portrayed fantastic I just wish we saw more of them because they're not in the movie that much but every second they are in it is great and the way they gave us their origins was smart quick to the point it also was funny speaking of funny this movie is absolutely hilarious which I personally think is crucial for a spider-man film I was laughing non-stop but the movie also has tons of action in heart lots of heart as for the main villain of the film that would be kingpin and his main motivation for what he's doing is awesome I love when a story can make you feel sympathy for the villain and of course I have to talk about the animation as that's one of the things everyone is freaking out about what can I say the animation looks incredible very different stylized and vibrant but more importantly to me it has a huge comic-book vibe this movie straight up looks like a comic book most of the time they use caption boxes for dialogue they'll shift in and out of comic panels they even go as far as to put halftone on the characters for those of you who don't know what halftone is it's that classic on book with all the dots and something I don't think people are talking enough about is the soundtrack for this movie I've been listening to it non-stop on iTunes since I left the theater the artists selection is fire as the kids say with all the good I already said about this film I think the reason this movie is getting so much praise and resonating with so many people is because of the heart and message it has it's not pushing some political message or ideal which is happening so much in this toxic climate we're currently in instead it gives us a message everyone could agree with and relate to no matter what walk of life you come from and that's what superheroes are supposed to do bring people together not be some political catalyst for debate and the message into the spider-verse gives is simple and something spider-man co-creator Stan Lee has been saying for years anyone can be spider-man it's simple yet so powerful it's a metaphor for saying it doesn't matter who you are where you're from what religion you believe what the color of your skin is just do good in the world try your hardest and take that leap of faith to accomplish your dreams and that's something we could all relate to on a human level and why I love the superhero genre so much because at the heart of it all superheroes are examples of hey you could be better you could do better just trust in yourself and others try your hardest and take that leap of faith and this movie hits that on so many levels with every character being amazing and miles being the heart and soul of it all man I just really want to see this movie again and I really don't have a complaint about this movie I had a blast watching it it's a great superhero and family film before I wrap up I do have to say there is a Stan Lee cameo and it hit me in the fields especially since this movie's heavily used as philosophy behind spider-man and of course stayed till the end credits trust me you're a die-hard spider-man fan you will not be disappointed speaking of diehard how about all those spider-man Easter eggs there was a crap-ton don't worry I'll get into all that on Monday to wrap up my thoughts whether you're a die-hard spider-man fan or just a casual movie goer you need to see this movie it's a ton of fun filled with comedy action drama and a great message spider-man into the spider verse easily is a 9 out of 10 for me but now that I'm done drooling over this awesome movie be sure to subscribe to our channel to keep up
