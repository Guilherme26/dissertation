wow what a time to be a horror fan I'm not even a huge horror,0.11270872
fan but you know what I'm gonna come over and join you guys because these,0.0809901
smart high-quality productions are not only impressive but wildly entertaining I'm talking about get out,0.05402023
it and now a quiet place and you know what I'm gonna throw 10 Cloverfield,0.29256332
Lane and split in there too and you know who produced a quiet place Michael,0.020837544
freakin Bay he actually produces a lot of horror movies he's behind the purge franchise,0.33832175
now he does that one with Jason Blum and you might think well it's all,0.02682087
blum but this is Bay you know you know Bay's the main producer here through,0.03174057
his company Platinum Dunes so clearly creatively there's more to him than meets the eye,0.04963401
but the person who is really going to benefit from this movie as they should,0.030356986
is Jim from the office he's directing he's co-writing he's co-starring and well I wouldn't,0.024203371
say he's an auteur director I wasn't aware of his creative vision so much while,0.038565353
watching the movie but after having seen it you realize his ability to deliver a,0.040922098
slick complete and profound horror package that's right profound is mighty impressive and I would,0.08828118
actually put his movie on par with those other films I just listed and I,0.07768347
hope that it enjoys the same success and recognition and I think it will because,0.053889852
the buzz from this for this movie coming out of South by Southwest where it,0.06479288
premiered has been anything but quiet however when the movie starts you're going to think,0.06268757
that I have lied to you because the first half of this film is super,0.075526945
slow and by the time John Krasinski and his real-life wife Emily Blunt were slow,0.16695245
dancing in silence I was like those South by Southwest people lied to me but,0.09728909
then after the movie is over you might think well I don't care how good,0.065925024
the second half is grace that first half should have been so boring but here's,0.07196489
the thing you realize that slow quiet first half of the movie was to prepare,0.07475933
you for the roller-coaster ride that is the second half of the movie which is,0.038417682
honestly one of the most terrifying movies I have ever seen I know I don't,0.04986815
have a high threshold for being able to take scares to be honest with you,0.023107149
but this is this movie I couldn't even look at the screen most of the,0.02760246
time I was like I'm just gonna listen to it I was so scared I,0.06113237
can't stress how much this movie had me in its grip and I loved it,0.051569026
I had a very good time now for instance I couldn't understand how this family,0.044101674
was able to keep quiet especially from the jump scares in the movie like John,0.043412544
Krasinski was like oh I'm gonna go look out this window and see if there's,0.05796211
a monster outside of it now I was like how are you gonna keep from,0.17014001
screaming when his head pops up right I mean I would just have duck I,0.24476896
would just duck and cover and like a little hole and be like what I,0.2481203
don't hear them anymore I'll come out this family had amazing self-control I mean I,0.079049096
guess under the circumstances they had to but I mean the movie really really will,0.024022441
make you think could I keep quiet these circumstances but again that's how much it,0.06334344
got me now why is the movie so successful why is it self to have,0.017935347
fine well I have three reasons that I think is the answer now the first,0.026340608
is that the monsters that are hunting them are not only very well designed but,0.17728208
also fairly well realized VFX wise this movie costs just 17 million to make and,0.023654595
I'm convinced that a very large portion of that was spent on visual effects they,0.01523071
are in the caliber of the highest blockbuster and like you really get to see,0.026302692
them on screen - this isn't like oh there's a monster elbow I mean they,0.16316688
do that too but eventually like you get full monster and well some of their,0.12172661
behavior doesn't make sense when you think about it and we'll discuss it in the,0.025119996
spoiler review it never occurred to me while I was watching the movie I was,0.055740394
really impressed and blown away I mean it was great stuff and even now that,0.075696565
I realized some problems with it I still wouldn't take points off the movie because,0.03896313
it didn't occur to me while I was watching it was really good alright then,0.045012314
- this movie uses the domino effect brilliantly like a seemingly small mistake triggers a,0.036620356
series of increasingly bigger ones and bigger problems very much like real life this family,0.058311995
made a lot of mistakes we'll talk about the family momentarily so the first half,0.027017765
is a lot about setting up those dominoes to fall for the second half so,0.030269846
think about that setting up dominoes boring watching them all fall quickly exciting that's how,0.13709302
you have to feel about the first half of the movie they needed to do,0.029568078
the work now three the quiet the quiet actually works because I think it pulls,0.04512007
you in closer to the story it's like when someone's like come closer and then,0.033813946
they go boo and you jump because you know put you in that in that,0.25374225
moment I think that's why I think that's what amplifies the scares because you think,0.033619046
about it you're like I've seen scary movies kind of in the same vein before,0.22656429
where monsters are chasing people around and on a farm but the quiet I think,0.07400168
just makes everything so much more heightened so you're more vulnerable to eventually being scared,0.041856017
out of your damn mind now luckily nobody in my theater because it was a,0.6299775
press screening and they had security watching us like hawks not to have our phones,0.025622874
on so nobody made any noise but there was a crucial moment during the movie,0.028121304
when John Krasinski and Emily Blunt were actually able to have a conversation and a,0.01762138
whispered conversation and some people outside the theater decided to have really loud discussion I,0.02234618
mean it wasn't their fault they didn't know it was playing inside and I think,0.033261176
you know they were just talking normal normal voice well actually they were a little,0.04337862
bit loud but you know a regular movie had been playing inside our theater it,0.11316969
wouldn't have been a problem but here they were kind of like background noise during,0.0371984
this crucial moment so I worry about people having a good viewing experience with this,0.035250075
movie like going into it I thought it would be fun if people made jokes,0.07380013
and chimed in and said a bunch of stuff during the beginning of the movie,0.018362395
but now that I think about how important it is to get you to that,0.02176481
place to experience the the second half maybe that one to keep you keep that,0.034913495
from happening so I think that if you when you go into this movie and,0.04341321
I of course highly recommend that you do you might want to consider a matinee,0.0471103
or even a morning show and maybe even paying extra for a premium theater just,0.016677484
doing whatever you can to make sure you're with an audience that's going to appreciate,0.032758962
this and want to have the experience as it's meant to be and not you,0.06618311
know mess it up just because you know they're not taking it too seriously so,0.03596182
that in addition to this movie being terrifying here's another warning for you it is,0.06746293
extremely sad Wow like it actually made me burst into tears what's really surprised me,0.09078693
I was like am i crying what does I didn't like the family very much,0.052896734
but in fact I almost was like this is too sad like I was really,0.030555876
sad but you know what if you're gonna list it if John Krasinski can elicit,0.0346268
that kind of emotional reaction for me again for characters I did not really like,0.020527568
well then I have to say kudos to him now why didn't I like the,0.02013644
family again no spoilers but they not only did they make like we're in a,0.02094996
horror movie mistakes like if they didn't make mistakes there'd be no movie obviously right,0.091872506
you know like oh yeah and they did everything perfectly good job family but all,0.031466514
so there are very bland and devoid of defined personalities like so often you know,0.045364194
one thing I'll say to you is that you know there's an argument about what,0.029683154
child can do what chores on the farm and it there do they seem to,0.02521312
be dividing it along gender lines and you would think that you know in a,0.12039957
modern film you know this is supposed to take place in the near future that,0.054122
the daughter would be like really post-apocalyptic gender rules are you kidding me with this,0.109434016
you know look like the only people practically left on earth who cares don't worry,0.13139106
I didn't spoil anything so you know you would think that the conversations never went,0.02079098
to that kind of real personal level like the characters didn't feel like real people,0.021306498
in many ways and then also for instance emily Blunt's character at the beginning of,0.0038228105
the movies pregnant so again not a spoiler and you're like well why would anyone,0.08692686
have a baby in this situation but they never discussed the pros and cons like,0.06919706
I would have loved for them to be like maybe this is a John Connor,0.024004482
baby and we hate we have to have it you know but the you know,0.114183426
the more we'll talk about this all a lot in the spoiler review but thinking,0.06324566
about it after I saw the movie last night I think that maybe that was,0.028173853
intentional as well though to make the family more ciphers so you can imagine yourself,0.07958789
in this situation and I did do that as I said I was like could,0.021466142
I stay quiet in this situation and I think maybe giving them more personality would,0.0723773
have made the experience less intimate and kept the audience at more of a distance,0.026522202
so I'm still breaking this movie down in my head as to why it worked,0.20852377
so well why it's so effective but what I am sure of is that it,0.02321624
is incredible it is an incredibly well-constructed movie like Wow probably not since inception has,0.026065221
a film been able to manipulate me emotionally and mentally to exactly where it wants,0.15158871
me now inception for instance made me question reality for a few days that's impressive,0.034463163
but I didn't love the film because ultimately I thought it relied on cheap tricks,0.022507818
but a quiet place I think because maybe it's a smaller film it created such,0.09011376
an emotional intimate experience and it both terrified and made me very sad that it,0.052216917
really got me I think this is just a really well made film I mean,0.03764607
crits like almost like a magic trick I'm not impressed with that so yeah don't,0.08088966
miss this movie it's very special and protect your movie going experience with this really,0.02973903
think ahead be like this family how are you gonna make sure that you learn,0.028439926
oh you're in an audience it stays quiet I almost wished they would make an,0.021977002
announcement being like you might be tempted to chime in but you got to trust,0.093119055
the movie and go with it or you're not gonna really experience it the way,0.07208794
it's meant to you're not gonna you're not gonna be able to experience that magic,0.08877541
trick and yes John Krasinski is definitely a triple threat to keep an eye on,0.11085352
going forward hey Jim I'm so happy for him look for awhile like he wasn't,0.06016453
gonna make it let's see how his uh his uh Jack Ryan serious is on,0.081526235
Amazon but anyway that's my review of a quiet place be sure to share your,0.027937047
own thoughts down below if you've seen the movie do not spoil it please again,0.035066485
what people experienced that magic trick save your comments for the spoiler review and of,0.01669611
