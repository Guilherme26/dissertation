a big fan of I like the movie Keanu I didn't love it but I,0.0908351
really think this guy's talented as well as Keegan they're both hilarious so I was,0.40333444
very curious to see where Jordan Peele could bring to a horror film and this,0.13694845
is definitely told from a very unique perspective we don't commonly see in genre filmmaking,0.06294853
at the center of the film is a Mantid in the middle of an interracial,0.11751794
relationship and he's told by a girlfriend he's about to meet her family for the,0.077901915
first time although they are unaware of the fact that he's black and so that,0.4032399
really makes him feel awkward when he gets there though all seems okay for a,0.12275989
while until he begins to realize there's some sinister stuff going on behind the scenes,0.12365029
I'm a big fan of horror you guys know that I've loved these movies in,0.29591814
my entire life and when a good one comes along it gives me the chills,0.108480565
it gives me the tingles it gives me something to think about and talk about,0.11783768
and it inspires me that's why when I saw the trailer for this movie I,0.095473036
was particularly enticed because it's definitely a courageous viewpoint you don't commonly see films like,0.14526019
this told from this perspective and I got to say walking out of it I'm,0.082433455
really impressed with Jordan Peele and I cannot wait to see what else he does,0.1018178
this is a very special debut because not only does he show that he understands,0.116434
how to direct genre films how to make a horror scene interesting or fun particularly,0.16958082
the fantastic opening scene that to my knowledge was one take which I really liked,0.068854935
but also that his singular voice can be maintained and come through your stereotypical genre,0.21740457
filmmaking because yes this film has a lot of horror tropes jump-scares things popping out,0.24150078
of you people walking past the hallway corridor accompanied by a loud jolt of music,0.13235348
but all through that it maintains its originality because of its central story and that,0.05230519
unique perspective is told through quite a bit of racial commentary and satire because this,0.2151321
film definitely has a satirical edge to it and there are a lot of moments,0.084941246
throughout the movie they cause some serious laughter to come from the entire audience because,0.07205695
it understands that although this is a over the top for a movie with some,0.060784895
very sinister elements behind the scenes there's definitely something to be said about the awkwardness,0.106960304
that one feels when he's in the middle of something that he's not entirely used,0.071259424
to and in this case Jordan Peele had said that he does sometimes feel very,0.055497
awkward when he's the only black person around and so we wanted to tell a,0.60205185
story from the perspective of somebody dealing with that see I grew up in a,0.03210147
very mixed race environment I had tons of friends of color so I never really,0.35057122
saw this myself personally I grew up in a very all-inclusive family that believed that,0.05102032
everyone is people we're all human and like it doesn't matter and I still feel,0.31089434
that way and I'm really really grateful for that upbringing because I've since learned as,0.088756174
an adult that that's rare so seeing a film like this can sometimes get under,0.10968784
my skin because I genuinely don't understand racism and that's because I never was really,0.1875946
exposed to it on a full scale so when I see it in movies like,0.055218898
this I have a hard time connecting with it and that's why I am so,0.06727696
glad that Jordan Peele wrote and directed this movie because he has taken this aspect,0.1693959
of the story that could get under a lot of people's skin and made it,0.13752165
so refreshing from his viewpoint because he has some amazing comic relief from lil rel,0.1366745
Howery who stole every scene he was in this guy-- look for him man he,0.48611093
is going to be in so much now he was so fricking hilarious in this,0.5154597
movie he had cane stitches in virtually every single sequence so Jordan Peele understands the,0.091885895
seriousness of this subject matter but also he is able to find considerable humor in,0.0951227
it and that was so refreshing daniel Kaluga plays the lead character and i apologize,0.072412044
sir if I said your name incorrectly I thought he was brilliant in the film,0.0848367
I didn't realize until after I saw it that he's actually from London his accent,0.15213612
is perfect I didn't even know for a second he was from the UK fantastic,0.17038079
performance Bradley Whitford is also really funny and good in this film really all around,0.07235933
the performances are very strong there's a good sense to the horror as well towards,0.110024266
the third act that builds to some really satisfying moments that had a lot of,0.065777056
people in my audience cheering as for issues with this movie there was a shot,0.24882212
in the trailer of a roaring deer skeletal monster and I was really enticed by,0.2902213
that and I was excited to see where that would play into this film it's,0.07766961
not in the movie though I hate when trailers do that when I insert things,0.16508178
in their trailer that end up just being on the cutting room floor road one,0.08105629
excuse me that was a still getting over that cold sorry also sometimes the pacing,0.109839976
does suffer there are a lot of sequences that are just very weird that are,0.1506754
meant to make you feel like you're watching a very awkward episode of The Twilight,0.15003076
Zone and sometimes it works but there are other times where you jump between tones,0.15260735
a little too quickly also there's some scares in the movie that in retrospect don't,0.075685404
really make sense there's one sequence where this guy is just running at full speed,0.11328734
towards our main character and then he just kind of darts to the right instantly,0.14024372
in retrospect once I know what's going on under the surface of this movie I,0.12790304
don't really get what's happening there it seemed like it was just a scare meant,0.09105611
for the audience and it doesn't really do much for the story I think you'll,0.060565688
