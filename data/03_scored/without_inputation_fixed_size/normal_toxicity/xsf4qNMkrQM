you're obviously a movie fan if you're watching this video so you probably heard the,0.24153803
bad news about Hollywood nothing is sacred and originality is dead we movie fans live,0.24003278
in a world where Ghostbusters was reinvented and if somebody announced that they were remaking,0.063320085
the Godfather tomorrow we probably wouldn't be surprised we're also not surprised when these remakes,0.13642038
almost never live up to the original and for the remake to surpass the original,0.10367541
the odds are insurmountable and I say this not to worry you because as I,0.24050573
mentioned before it probably doesn't even surprise you but to let you know that this,0.12745543
version of a star is born' defies those odds let's make the odds of success,0.08536813
even more insurmountable shall we a star is born is not just a remake it's,0.077366315
a remake of a remake of a remake it's the fourth time this cinematic story,0.07187956
has been told and as much as he's a Hollywood a-lister Bradley Cooper hasn't really,0.0867646
directed a film before this is his directorial debut and on top of that he,0.070022166
thought he should also act co-write and take singing lessons as well I from one,0.12614219
of them really glad that he took all of this on because you can actually,0.10269467
tell this was a passion project that Cooper wanted to tell this story in every,0.06266926
nuance of the film you could tell that he was giving it his all and,0.054049425
yes that includes taking a few singing lessons now that seems like a small thing,0.11197981
but it actually lends itself to something that all films need and remakes generally lack,0.076087326
authenticity now I use that word because in the past on real school I've asked,0.07213277
this question before why is it important to you the filmmaker to retell a story,0.188513
to remake a movie now granted I may never know why exactly it was important,0.09547632
for Bradley Cooper to retell this story but I never questioned the importance when watching,0.10640278
this film a lot of that actually goes back to him taking singing lessons and,0.12218113
I don't just mean the commitment it takes to take singing lessons it's the fact,0.0643233
that that importance that authenticity comes through in every facet of his performance but especially,0.08318444
in his singing it should also be said that while Cooper is not the most,0.08708762
refined singer he didn't really need to be because you know what neither guys like,0.076663524
Tom Waits Bob Dylan or Leonard Cohen they may not have the greatest voices in,0.13280691
the world fact is there's so much truth there's so much soul to their songs,0.090616286
that it's just encapsulating and so is Cooper in fact I would argue there's always,0.1020572
a vulnerability to somebody singing that there's always an authenticity because they're baring their soul,0.13831067
to you but as I mentioned before it's not just this singing because Cooper brings,0.18104991
that vulnerability that shared experience that openness in almost everything he does on screen but,0.052658662
really we've got to talk about the music if you're like me or millions of,0.07043013
others who have seen the trailer to this film chances are you've already got the,0.057138357
song stuck in your head and guess what when you see the movie they'll get,0.25695285
stuck all over again and that's a good thing kudos to the promotional team of,0.1419699
a star is born because it's one of the most memorable and powerful trailers I've,0.042368386
ever seen then again the footage comes from a mom memorable and powerful film and,0.05660912
music has been key in all previous versions of this film and you know what,0.090930335
Cooper really knew that because he knew exactly how to use music he and the,0.06852535
musical production team are the conductor's and the orchestra is the film itself the movie,0.027884325
hooks you right off the bat and of course it does that using music Bradley,0.2642661
Cooper's Jackson has this hypnotic swagger as he opens the movie blasting his version of,0.31924093
rock and country to a raucous crowd of thousands of concert goers but the music,0.2945445
can also be muted creating that sense of vulnerability and intimacy that I earlier spoke,0.088413365
of and it's that intimate musical connection that actually drives the story predominantly it's the,0.055361506
love story between Bradley Cooper's Jackson and Lady Gaga's Ally because it seems that the,0.06207224
only time that they're really themselves in terms of the characters is when they sing,0.05161673
to one another you see the songs of their love story and we're just there,0.049400818
to listen when I said that the music might get stuck inside your head just,0.53490317
like the trailer that I'd actually be doing it a disservice it doesn't just get,0.119962834
stuck inside your head it gets stuck inside your soul your heart it becomes a,0.51556385
part of you it really connects you to the film it's beautiful it's powerful it's,0.09925464
the for the winds I can't wait for this film to get a wider release,0.08364096
because I can't wait to get my ears on that full soundtrack like you saw,0.2620107
on the trailer Gaga and Cooper have tremendous chemistry but they also have tremendous balance,0.033618994
while Cooper may not be the greatest singer and Gaga was the one coached him,0.14864351
up a bit when it came to his music Gaga is not necessarily the strongest,0.0814922
actor out there but Cooper gives her so much in their scenes together that she,0.16905962
really raises her game and guess what gives her performance that's on par with Bradley,0.10402909
Cooper director Cooper also really helps out their performance because he definitely uses the framing,0.06777505
of the camera and sound to make it seem like they're the only two in,0.07325687
the world it doesn't matter where they are on stage with thousands of screaming fans,0.14021496
in a loud dressing room full of hilarious drag queens in an abandoned parking lot,0.1523544
in the middle of the night or a brawl in a dive bar the fact,0.0937237
is you're only focused on them the point is you're always invested even to your,0.14008236
own detriment I actually found myself almost verbally yelling at the screen when some of,0.138363
the characters made a bad decision I very rarely do that because I'm somewhat disconnected,0.08184925
from the film but that tells you how much I'm invested it was akin to,0.047368463
yelling at the screen and a horror movie telling a character not to go in,0.15273981
there because the killer is inside there was only one time where I was actually,0.18305272
taken out of the film in musicals the characters always jump into impromptu songs and,0.05808839
dance numbers and they instantly know the choreography and the musical arrangements and you know,0.0340281
what in this movie there was something very close to that now they tried to,0.057208154
address it but in my mind unsuccessfully but as I mentioned that's the only time,0.08753949
that my suspension of disbelief caused an issue because it's more of a drama with,0.10565687
music not a musical itself I also saw a very different performance that I'm used,0.050656494
to seeing from Sam Elliott who plays Jackson's older brother much much older brother now,0.061054964
you would think that's another moment where I couldn't necessarily suspend my disbelief but they,0.082059085
he really felt like brothers with all the fighting familiarity and frustration that comes with,0.09269364
a fraternity my biggest complaint was you get a tremendous dramatic performance from Chappelle noodles,0.15471408
and Jackson seem like friends you get a tremendous connection with Gaga and Andrew Dice,0.07639966
Clay they actually seemed like daughter and father you get this great brotherly relationship with,0.1536128
Cooper and Elliott and yet they're all gone way too quickly in this film if,0.063957
the film had slightly better balance when it came to subplots and characters I felt,0.063930094
it could have been just that much more powerful but I also feel that this,0.042140476
is probably the most powerful version of this story so far granted the previous versions,0.049245566
of this film actually all had success the original one Oscar's the two previous one,0.07862962
Golden Globes for both their leads and you know what I don't see that changing,0.07713942
Gaga may not win Cooper's certainly won't win everything but this movie will win something,0.061105203
as a first film Cooper should be more than proud by his rookie effort he,0.06176167
created a very beautiful touching and intimate film he got everyone on the same page,0.35298303
and created a story that reflects on regret love addiction and shows us that music,0.10637386
can really connect us it is most certainly and earn it poll question who is,0.046831086
