hello everybody welcome back to another review of one of the 100 essential films you've got to check out from pop chart this week we're going over double indemnity which i still don't think i'm saying correctly this is a 1944 american psychological thriller it opens up with our main character walter neff stumbling into his office with a gunshot wound there he begins to record his confession on an old-time dictaphone which there are entirely too many jokes to make i couldn't settle on just one so i'll leave it up to you insert your joke there uh and this confession is admitting to his friend and co-worker barton keys all of the details to a fraudulent life insurance claim murder conspiracy adultery the whole nine yards it is a nail-biter of a film in the sense of seeing if our main character is gonna get away with it uh the interesting thing about this movie is the majority of it is done as a flashback as walter is explaining how everything came to be this crazy adventure gets started when walter goes to the house of one of the insurance companies clients walter is an insurance salesman and during one of his routine checks of one of his clients who had a lapse in car insurance he runs into phyllis dietrichson there's a little flirting back and forth and phyllis asks walter about a life insurance policy on her husband and that gets everything started i don't want to go into all the details of the story because that's really all of the fun of a movie like this the only detail that i will tell about this movie and how it unfolds is that it gets its name double indemnity from a clause in the insurance policy in which the policy would pay out double if something were to happen in certain places uh but there was a statement that walter had said during his confession about about when you work at a place and you try to figure out how somebody can cheat you so that you can protect yourself and he said that it's only a matter of time until you start thinking oh i know all the ins and outs i know how to cheat this company or i know how to steal from this company and i remember watching it and thinking like oh my god that is a thing that happens i won't name drop but i had a friend who after watching oceans 11 swore up and down he knew how to i'm sorry swore up and down he knew how to do the best heist ever and i was the voice of reason right off the bat and said no that's not how it works that's not gonna happen and the more he kept telling me his foolproof plan it sounded like it could have worked luckily uh logic and intelligence prevailed um surprisingly from me and i was able to talk him out of doing something very stupid but let me know in the comments below if you've ever even had that thought of uh i i could get away with something uh i know i myself never would because i'm a good person and good people don't think like that there was one thing with the writing um and oh my god it was like nails on a chalkboard every time i heard it we've talked before in some of these past videos about how these older movies just really force fed you a love story within a couple of days of meeting two people were madly in love and wanted to run away together and of course that is the premise of uh the whole plot of this movie but walter keeps referring to phyllis as baby almost like he forgot what her name is so whenever there's a phone call or they see each other it's oh hey baby i missed you baby i love you baby and i'm like jeez just for the love of god say her name once wants to let me know that you know it i don't think i had heard about this movie until it popped up on the list of movies to do uh i'm glad that i watched it i don't know if it's essential uh i don't think there was anything that really stood out as this was a movie that needed to be seen but if you like noir films you'll probably very much enjoy this one and with that being said we get to the scratching so here is the scratching you'll understand the crutches when you watch the movie i'm going to take a guess and say that maybe there is a train behind this one let's see oh man i was thinking i was gonna be a trainer but no it is a guy using the crutches who would have thunk it all right so that is the scratching off of double indemnity next week we are going over it's a wonderful life which i am ashamed to admit i have not seen yet so uh i am i am in for a treat it's definitely been on my list of movies to check out i just haven't pulled the trigger on it yet uh i want to thank everybody for taking time out of the day
