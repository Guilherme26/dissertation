I'm sorry I tried not honest as a classic but there's classics that are really good in in catching to me,0.07322236
and this movie wasn't that good nor catching to me the actors in the movie though were great just the way the storyline was set up wasn't that's great and I had to look at the summary to figure out what was Isabel,0.1430953
and as I try to watch it multiple times I'd look at the summary is about how though the main mob boss is handing over his empire to his son and just was not happening like the Sunday want to have the company dad not to come,0.0712852
he didn't want to own the mob,0.10176332
