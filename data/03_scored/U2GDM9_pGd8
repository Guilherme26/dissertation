hey everybody today I'm going to be talking about a parasite this film was co-written,0.649698
and directed by bong joon-ho he's the director that's gained a lot of momentum in,0.14790034
terms of his international success and acclaim I would say within the last 10 years,0.04271596
or so he's a nod to her that's quite appreciated in the US and Paris,0.1336743
that really is my first exposure to this director I went in knowing almost nothing,0.05475536
about the movie and I think that that is the best way to experience it,0.08166049
if you haven't seen the film I actually recommend that you stop watching this review,0.10706194
go watch it and then come back and see what I have to say because,0.090974495
I just think that you're gonna get a lot more out of it I think,0.15218809
the strength of this film is how it surprises you when it surprises you it's,0.09837765
never really jarring in the traditional sense you know it's not kind of jolting you,0.17010038
back and forth your emotions everything feels very seamless and in terms of the transitions,0.07876559
it feels like it's more kind of sliding and curving its way around this plot,0.09311737
rather than taking really kind of angular corners it's very meticulous very controlled you never,0.099356905
know where it's gonna go tonally or in terms of the plot and that is,0.04799792
quite refreshing I often talk about movies like this it's a common theme in the,0.08408366
movies that we see it's where you know we're talking about a director who is,0.045275904
making a movie that is pulling from all of these very distinct very different genres,0.110150255
from the past and sort of passing them together where you as an audience member,0.08285485
and certainly the director feels very aware of the influences where the story itself becomes,0.040130954
more I mean as I said conscious it's it's more about how the culture has,0.09520028
shaped the point of view of this writer of this director this particular story and,0.1606806
while this does have a lot of that in it it's not that kind of,0.07335063
movie at the same time this is a film that wants to swerve in and,0.11404409
out of these different lanes these these each Lane being a different genre but it's,0.09842318
doing it in a way that is very stealthy and it's almost almost invisible at,0.050577883
times the film is dabbling in all kinds of things at first it seems to,0.07796942
be more kind of like a like a black comedy satire it has a lot,0.24133748
of slapstick comedy but then it starts to beer more into the horror thriller genre,0.2480704
but ultimately it is a movie that is about it's a social commentary on class,0.079157144
struggle but all of this is a homogenous blend that seems to have all the,0.10728125
flavors of all of these ideas but it's all at once and it's all one,0.108985394
concoction and there's not a moment where you don't feel that the film is completely,0.085734345
in control of every every beat every little thing that it is saying every hair,0.15158574
is perfectly in place and there was just one moment I can't even give you,0.14933904
the context for the moment I don't remember where it happened I just remember seeing,0.035696723
this image it was very quick but you could see kind of an image of,0.08006163
Alfred Hitchcock and I think some other people that might have influenced him and that's,0.1493276
like the one time where it really feels conscious as if to say yes I,0.10045776
am pulling from all of these different influencers these different tours and their genres but,0.089143746
it is so brief it it's so quick you miss it and of course I'm,0.10840086
going to pay attention to that especially being who I am I'm gonna notice all,0.1529557
of the different ways that the story is being constructed but overall I found it,0.028641455
to be much more palatable for me and and something more interesting because the effect,0.05470326
of it was so subtle and so sophisticated it's a very slow boil in terms,0.15804806
of how it escalates to the climax and I think having all of that beneath,0.22330911
the service having all of these these genres and the ideas behind it be almost,0.15504956
invisible it really makes the film more layered it gives it a lot more complexity,0.06794634
more dimension because it allows us to explore everything so much more keenly you know,0.06744145
we're exploring we're aware of all of these different facets in terms of the emotions,0.06625319
on the human spectrum and we're seeing it through all of these genres which they,0.07091415
sort of define the world they define what the world is about in all kinds,0.036066093
of different ways all kinds of different points of view and it's exploring what life,0.11518546
is about and how we experience it when the film began I saw this of,0.038502224
course more as slapstick comedy because there's a lot more humor in it than I,0.3369586
was expecting and it is yeah so it's like it's like a black comedy about,0.31089434
class struggle and how it is shifted in the modern age is very satirical talking,0.15584065
about even in just the first scene how they're just living for that that Wi-Fi,0.08215884
signal that they're trying to get from other neighbors because they don't they don't have,0.05345982
any where you know the idea of pressing send on a text message that could,0.06826154
be really bad for you is it seems like to these people it's almost like,0.25850227
a clear bomb going off it's almost the same thing pressing sin can change your,0.3181061
whole life how the DIY culture is changing everything breaking the walls down on how,0.15028268
things can be done and who does things I mean we have the ability now,0.07304733
to be able to be able to take different jobs just by googling how to,0.06435437
do them and are watching youtube videos on how to do things and that changes,0.08900976
everything because you don't have to have a formal education or anything like that but,0.17924044
pretty early on I'd say especially when they start going to the actual house where,0.05492023
the film really takes place you start to get watts of the of those thriller,0.17373548
and horror vibes but that all comes to fruition more in the third act where,0.08925911
everything shifts into a more off-kilter more eccentric idea of what horror is as well,0.16905919
as the comedy where the brutality it becomes the focus it's the poor working secretly,0.19050092
underground and they are literally below the upper class what the movie seems to be,0.12230373
saying is that you always have to break a few eggs to make an omelet,0.32001722
in this sort of society one person's gain is always going to be another person's,0.14770384
loss unfortunately this movie did remind me of Jordan peels us a lot that's of,0.1497132
course a movie that came out in the United States and it was earlier this,0.104190975
year but there are so many similarities because then it is also a film that,0.07152941
is a commentary on on socio politics and it is also filtered through this genre-bending,0.13074598
lens that is it's kind of part pastiche it's part comedy it's part horror it,0.13526067
is part satire as well that's a movie that I did not get around to,0.08279289
reviewing but I did like it quite a bit however I have to say that,0.110257484
this film it takes it a lot further it takes a lot of these ideas,0.15081584
much further and it's it's more focused it's more cohesive morally as well as as,0.09207021
plot wise and it's just more skillfully or skillful in terms of how it's able,0.09585349
to manipulate the audience into feeling all of these things all of these emotions that,0.10638229
shift all over the spectrum he'll has a great quote that I love to recite,0.08762479
a lot because I think it's a great philosophy for him but you know he,0.0774193
was talking about his career change people couldn't believe that he went to you know,0.10284351
from like sketch comedy to all of these these auteur horror films but he said,0.32949093
he doesn't think that it's really that that jarring of a difference he does not,0.07743916
think that comedy is really that different from horror the the line between them is,0.14552039
actually very thin and I think that parasite also embodies that idea and I think,0.5632497
that somebody like Jordan Peele would really appreciate something like parasite it's the idea of,0.38353264
how sometimes life and its ideas are just too complex to be contained within one,0.13718727
genre life even when it is very tragic is also at the same time full,0.08690447
of a lot of awkward things and funny things it's all kinds of different genres,0.13456851
that constantly run into one another I actually think that this movie parasite could more,0.5053477
so be compared to a movie like Takashi Amie case the audition or I should,0.07694128
say audition I'm sorry I always say the UM which I feel like if you,0.08778075
haven't seen that movie and you are interested don't watch any more of this review,0.07690274
because I feel like I've already given you too much information or just with that,0.051138118
that sentence don't even look at the cover of the movie you know if you,0.100300424
can get somebody to press play for you before you watch it because the less,0.1055748
you know the better it is very similar to this film and it is also,0.080722176
one of my favorite movies of all time but for those of you who have,0.09408423
seen it I'm sure you you know what I mean how it subtly builds from,0.0746791
something that's very quiet contemplative very sweet and romantic and almost like it's a like,0.3062992
an a zoo film and then it just twists and twists and twist into this,0.19362178
so realistic horror piece and for me that that is one of the crowning achievements,0.19211464
of being able to do that sort of thing but I admire that film and,0.07484212
I admire parasite as well I would say though that something like audition is more,0.34420165
elevated more sophisticated for me there were a few times in parasite where I thought,0.32027084
that there were some kind of iffy lines but when I say all of that,0.06520654
I am very much nitpicking another reason I think that the movie does have that,0.061802402
emotional weight because it is a very tragic film is because all of the characters,0.10960975
are so nuanced and so dimensional you don't see the upper-class characters as villains necessarily,0.090969905
and you don't see the poor culprits as the villains either of course the Kim,0.21596143
family is the one that we follow them where we're going on their journey from,0.061632898
beginning to end but we do also root for the the upper-class family and I,0.06976779
think part of that is is the performance by the actress who plays the the,0.05808066
rich mother I I liked a lot of the performances in this movie but hers,0.1519404
in particular I really liked with a character like her she does need to be,0.14214921
that that that emotional center she requires the ability to embody that innocence and that,0.11396127
that gullibility and just that that natural comedic ignorance that that rich people tend to,0.53490317
have there is something kind of endearing about it and you're sort of drawn to,0.11007471
it because she's just just like anybody else she's just living her life and she's,0.31089434
doing what she believes is best for her family and in the same way the,0.06933447
Kim family is doing what is best for them of course the stakes are much,0.0716459
higher for them but but it's the same sort of thing but by the time,0.07504865
you get to the third act of the movie I think each of the main,0.110249236
players could be seen at some points as very sympathetic and at other times as,0.065254934
as villains how the plot develops and how those character motivations develop is to me,0.10955608
the overall strength and what I said does give it that emotional art because as,0.057794128
I said this is a technical achievement but also one that really does resonate with,0.04561903
you emotionally and I think overall this movie is a total knockout I think I,0.38763437
advise everyone to see it if you can because it is it's worth every minute,0.10188562
of your time and that's my review thank you all for listening all of my,0.07902761
