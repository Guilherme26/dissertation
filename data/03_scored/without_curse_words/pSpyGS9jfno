sorry I just won't take another look at you what does it flick fans and,0.095254704
welcome back to my channel I just watched the brand new Bradley Cooper directed movie,0.053132787
a star is born and I feel like I'm like the last one of my,0.05030256
youtube critic friends to watch this movie there have been so many early screenings it's,0.09648885
kind of early it's Wednesday I guess but I finally got to see this film,0.07674931
that I was also excited for if you guys don't know how my reviews work,0.15460023
I like to talk about the good the bad and then give you my score,0.171961
so many reviews coming out this weekend but right now we are talking a star,0.05734002
is born let's get right into it so a musician helps a young singer and,0.06488113
actress find fame even as age and alcoholism sins his own career into a downward,0.2274565
spiral and that's actually the first time I've read that synopsis pretty accurate and if,0.054149676
you hear that premise and you haven't heard any buzz about this film you're gonna,0.17533743
say Austin hold on okay this is a movie that I have heard before I've,0.064537406
seen it before what can you do different what can you do to impress me,0.09870894
what can you make me do to want to seek this film and watch it,0.17238411
more than any other movie in theaters right now especially with a little movie coming,0.07129768
out called venom it's going to be hard to top that so it all comes,0.14104293
down to is this movie going to appeal to the mass audience and I can,0.11886775
1000% say I absolutely think it will this thing is a crowd-pleaser if I have,0.10324775
ever seen one but it's not just that right this is some beautiful filmmaking on,0.09040254
top of technical goodness on top of great and I mean great cinematography and it,0.06670846
all comes down to Bradley Cooper I mean this guy he has been one of,0.37702012
my favorite actors for a long time he can do blockbusters he can do psychological,0.15423867
films he can do independent movies but now I think the guy has proven that,0.104975894
he can literally do anything he trained himself how to play the guitar he learned,0.11870355
how to sing I'm sure he already knew how to sing but he perfected that,0.08888447
and my goodness he steals the show in terms of his performance he was so,0.19754027
good in the role but the big factor here was he brought in Lady gaga,0.1957694
right and we have never really seen her act now she was on American Horror,0.1441266
Story I heard she did well but I didn't get a chance to check her,0.08047009
out and she is 100% in her element here she is a singer a star,0.11175022
in real life and she gets to portray those things on screen and that's one,0.100032225
of the reasons why I think she works so well is because yes she is,0.075291894
in her element I want to see her expand from this I would like to,0.11566905
see her in a different role something you wouldn't expect from her but that being,0.07961613
said I do think she did a very very very good job she conveyed emotion,0.12846388
better than I thought she would she is definitely going to get nominated for an,0.06716589
Oscar now for me should she win I don't know if I'm ready to say,0.12535827
that it's definitely not the best female performance I have seen all year but she,0.15165855
was very good she was in her element she deserves to be nominated for that,0.09451159
fact and her performances in this movie were so powerful that's one thing she can,0.10323834
do she can sing the lights out and she literally sang the lights out in,0.09196901
our theater because it was dark she was great Bradley Cooper was great Sam Elliott,0.09348243
Dave Chappelle had a supporting role now it was very very very minor like I,0.059178013
said the look at the film the shot selection the sound the sound design in,0.06280221
the theater and it may just been the theater that I was in but my,0.03723159
goodness guys I felt like I was in a concert the first third of this,0.15180297
movie there are so many performances on stage just the way that it's filmed the,0.06009813
way that it follows Bradley Cooper around right down to the conversations that people have,0.088172786
how the camera tracks them I love the way this thing was filmed and that,0.07877908
once again we are bringing this back to Bradley Cooper the man has given us,0.11009248
one of the best first directing jobs I have seen in I want to say,0.08049036
decades it got such an emotional response out of the audience I was sitting there,0.0484398
I'm not gonna lie at times I was so emotionally invested in these characters okay,0.12160237
what's going to happen next I think I know what's going to happen next which,0.07786138
I'll get into that a little bit later but I still really enjoyed it for,0.10591844
what it was and I hope I'm not selling this the wrong way guys I,0.13463058
didn't just enjoy this movie I thought this movie was phenomenal I'm just telling you,0.08544576
that it takes all of these cliche things that we have seen before and it,0.09203316
reinvents them so well I'm still sitting here trying to collect my thoughts like okay,0.13659449
what did I like about this and why was this done so well because it,0.06147962
is it's not my genre right it's not the kind of film that I see,0.083004035
myself going back to over and over but a star is born is absolutely an,0.05220185
exception just because of how well it was made but the biggest thing for me,0.061696663
when reviewing a film is all I can tell you is how I felt while,0.14166056
I was watching the movie how invested was I in these characters did I buy,0.056556407
the relationship because if you don't buy the relationship you're not going to buy the,0.06356789
rest of the film and the relationship was awesome you know when he first discovers,0.0340281
her in that bar from there on out and there's a lot of humor in,0.10967428
here too I just reminded myself of how funny some of those scenes were in,0.11260376
the bar the first I will say the first half of the film is full,0.06675483
of some great realistic humor and that's one thing I'm going to keep saying about,0.09078156
this movie is it's realistic when you're talking about the story the way that it,0.07054831
goes some things that are happening in their personal lives it's a very down-to-earth and,0.08898265
grounded story it's not we're gonna put some Nicholas Sparks in here and we're gonna,0.07910011
talk like this to let you know there even though that doesn't make any sense,0.09776024
and we're gonna do this even though that's not realistic no this is not a,0.053088576
Nicholas Sparks movie I want people to understand that people who do not want to,0.18068554
see a star is born trust me when I first saw the trailer I'm like,0.056359228
oh it's a great trailer I just don't know if there's movies for me this,0.100119144
movie is for everyone even if you don't like a good romantic comedy this isn't,0.11126784
really a romantic comedy but you know what I mean in terms of negatives I,0.13318044
mean I don't have very many there are some things that are foreshadowed in the,0.07516907
beginning and it's very obvious that Bradley Cooper was foreshadowing those things so I can't,0.092123814
say that it's necessarily a negative even though they hinted very strongly towards what was,0.07615893
going to happen at the end if you pay close attention you'll know what I'm,0.1103664
talking about especially there's a scene at the beginning just pay attention to that scene,0.09532139
but yeah I kind of knew what was going to happen but in this case,0.066229545
that doesn't really matter predictability wasn't an issue for me because the journey to that,0.049355444
destination was so well done and if you can do that I can forgive the,0.06375132
fact that the plot was a little predictable and it's also predictable because this is,0.05189182
a remake this has been done before now I have never seen those other movies,0.10888255
so I don't really have anything to compare this to and maybe that's why I,0.08026525
love this movie so much maybe I am completely wrong and the other films are,0.116534255
a lot stronger than this one but I've never seen those movies and like I,0.10378547
said Lady Gaga was fantastic she is in her element and I'm not taking anything,0.24295652
away from her do not misquote me because I thought she was worthy of a,0.3351972
nomination I just don't think she's going to win this year because it's not the,0.09950039
strongest performance I have seen and there are still many movies to come but getting,0.05064173
a home run your very first time at bat okay I'll take it and maybe,0.26314187
one or two of the scenes that were supposed to knock me out with that,0.15142539
emotional punch did not knock me out like I think he'd intended to especially towards,0.38608995
the end the other eight or nine that we're supposed to and did that definitely,0.05981755
overshadows the ones that didn't so I definitely think this movie will get you emotionally,0.23981848
invested even if you're going in with a little bit of hesitation I see y'all,0.10214435
out there just like oh I don't want gonna see the stars born you should,0.124224685
go see this when you bring us something that is this old yet well-known and,0.13167597
spin it in a completely new and fresh and just all-around different version of what,0.044562962
we thought that we have seen before I think you have accomplished a task that,0.10887995
people can rarely accomplish in Hollywood and a star is born did all of those,0.115438655
things I think this movie on a technical level on a filmmaking level is almost,0.18095908
flawless on a story level it's not perfect it's something that we have seen like,0.074314035
I said before but it just hits all of those emotional beats all of the,0.15358204
beats that it needed to hit combined with I think one of the best concert,0.13402224
experiences I have ever had first of all in the movie theater they felt like,0.07606445
I was watching a concert and III just loved every second of the guys this,0.12668435
is one of my favorite movies of the year I'm going to give a star,0.05690253
is born right now a 95 percent I just think this movie is everything that,0.06568894
you want in a crowd-pleasing emotional gut punch of a film and those are my,0.47210708
thoughts on a star is born but the most important question that I have for,0.039255347
