enter our giveaway on Instagram for this stranger things skateboard it's open until December 19th,0.06531855
so enter now I've been a huge fan of del Toro's for years and the,0.05429128
shape of water ranks among his very best and will no doubt lead to tons,0.058290593
of award consideration this season like the seven Golden Globes it's already been nominated for,0.06730711
del Toro describes us as his most personal film as he has always wanted to,0.08248775
make his own version of a classic Universal monster movie in this case he pulled,0.31089434
inspiration from The Creature from the Black Lagoon and the amphibian man's appearance bears more,0.0010720806
than a little resemblance to the original creature unlike the classic Universal monster movies that,0.31044787
inspired him shape of waters is an antithesis to those classic films where the monsters,0.31974706
are treated with some sympathy but ultimately they are rejected by society as monsters and,0.4032395
the only fitting end for them is death the shape of water does the opposite,0.16083048
with its amphibian man treating him not as a monster at all but rather a,0.3141493
romantic hero and in fact worthy of love it's an impressive new spin on those,0.07329305
kinds of films which makes it a real bummer to recently learn that del Toro,0.15489484
turned down the opportunity to helm universals dark universe can you imagine how perfect that,0.097102016
would have been but instead after the lackluster mummy the dark universe is all over,0.35148212
once again before it even got a chance to start but it's probably for the,0.038360465
best that he turned it down as the shape of water is holy his own,0.091787994
creation done on his own terms and is all the more successful because of that,0.07317332
so let's look at the shape of water exploring the main themes of the film,0.05853863
as well as explaining its quite mysterious ending our story takes place in Baltimore in,0.09401967
the 1960s at the height of our Cold War Rasha this time in history is,0.07466542
quite a bit different than today with many people marginalized due to what was believed,0.17096545
by the then current standards of society women handicapped people black people and gay men,0.768691
are all amongst those that are outcasts by society and essentially treated as lesser than,0.1521422
others unable to reach the same opportunities as others at the time on the opposite,0.113594435
spectrum we have the class with the highest status amongst all others the white man,0.5154597
and all of these sides are represented via characters in the film seeing through their,0.031841386
stories that the ideologies of the time create blind hatred while attempting to understand others,0.18936543
even if considered different by society is the antidote to that mentality our main window,0.17181449
into this is via ELISA a young handicapped woman who is found abandoned as a,0.2995219
child with three cuts on each side of her neck apparently the results of being,0.3983979
attacked which is a pretty horrible thing for a baby to go through because of,0.31089434
this injury she has been mute throughout her life and uses sign language to communicate,0.23984225
with others and this is to literally represent the idea of a woman like her,0.17942978
not having a voice or being heard in the current social climate her being mute,0.23977573
as well as a woman affords her little opportunity and she along with her black,0.44235337
friend Zelda work as cleaners for a government research facility ignored and invisible they are,0.16985816
given little praise for their work described merely as piss wipers well that's not very,0.3705151
motivating she are not exactly closeted gay friend Giles live in the shadows of society,0.514579
in a small set of apartments over a movie theater Giles too suffers from being,0.14906672
outcast by society due to being a gay man we're in the 60s this was,0.46620405
usually kept as a secret and Giles loses his job as an advertisement artist after,0.09351235
an incident most likely involving him being open about being gay just like ELISA Giles,0.33895183
in his own way is mistreated entirely because of who he is and that not,0.10901656
fitting the era's ideologies elisa's life is pretty routine at first until a new asset,0.07255365
is brought to the facility she works at by Colonel Strickland this all-american hero is,0.13657174
at the top of the heap and this eras great America and at the time,0.17401311
things truly were great for people like him he's white married quotes Bible verses missive,0.31116572
Lita Zelda questioning why she has no siblings like most of her people and he's,0.4772335
the kind of guy that when told by a salesman four out of five successful,0.1488315
men drive a Cadillac he buys one on the spot because of course he's one,0.14902727
of those successes himself at least in his own mind the white privilege constantly afforded,0.5154597
to him leads him to believe he is the hero of his own story and,0.0744946
this is kind of a flip of a typical hero of the classic monster movies,0.4251441
the square-jawed hero is supposed to be the romantic adventurer but Strickland personifies this only,0.17716421
to himself and is in fact the film's antagonist he's returned from South America with,0.054699786
a creature a thing as he refers to it an aquatic monster who is worshipped,0.4427155
as a God by the locals and no this is not a spin-off of Hellboy,0.10891637
even though the amphibian man and ape sapien are both betrayed by longtime del Toro,0.21060795
collaborator Doug Jones with the creature now captive Strickland exhibits his feelings of superiority over,0.17515208
it treating it hostile II rather than attempting to understand it prodding it with his,0.1705514
electric baton as the creature is a primal being it reacts aggressively to Strickland's behavior,0.16457625
biting off two of his fingers but if the creature is treated with compassion a,0.31089434
different more sympathetic side emerges which we see in its interactions with ELISA when she,0.19424981
has a chance encounter with the creature unlike Strickland she treats it with wonder and,0.11433486
interest and after more encounters the to develop a friendship even romantic feelings with ELISA,0.10493815
teaching it sign language as the creature also has no voice like herself granting the,0.18021007
two the ability to communicate so we see there is much more to the amphibian,0.1488238
man beyond being a deadly monster but of course to Strickland it is nothing more,0.4620413
than a thing a curiosity and it's decided to kill the creature and perform an,0.4722404
autopsy on him to learn what they can when ELISA learns of this she hatches,0.24782036
a plan with the help of her friends to break the creature out of the,0.2652148
facility keeping him in a bathtub at her apartment in disbelief in losing the asset,0.27907762
and under increasing scrutiny from his superiors Strickland launches an investigation into the escape questioning,0.054865737
all of the employees at the facility when Excel de an√°lisis turned to be interviewed,0.13398165
Strickland dismisses them as possible subjects how could these two possibly pull off a heist,0.2755463
like that and instead pins his suspicions on the Russians being responsible knowing he will,0.20524967
eventually track them down Alisa finds a way to set the amphibian man free once,0.12107121
and for all using a canal that feeds directly into the ocean but they have,0.32187474
to wait until the specific day the rainfall is high enough for it to work,0.06709424
so Giles and ELISA keep the amphibian man in hiding in the mean time and,0.13966651
Giles comes around to accepting the creature after some initial reluctance and we see with,0.13537125
Giles that there is another power at its disposal the ability to heal in this,0.109741226
case after touching Giles is bald head the creature begins to glow blue and veins,0.31089434
all over its body and later Giles finds he has new hair growth on his,0.096990764
once bald head this is our first example of the creatures healing abilities as well,0.1725885
as showing us that concept of understanding once again to the creature even as a,0.11919504
gay man Charles is worthy just like everyone else is worthy of acceptance and he,0.6441625
did help him escape as well as forgiving him for eating one of his cats,0.16989428
so yeah he's a good guy then the fateful day arrives with the rain pouring,0.079753675
heavily as they gather at the canal but before they can set him free a,0.107160166
crazed Strickland arrives furiously shooting the creature and Alisa full of bullet holes the creature,0.6631343
is motionless and for a moment it appears that Strickland got what he wanted in,0.074898
the end but then the creatures skin starts to glow brightly once again this time,0.087616235
healing his wounds and reviving him and Strickland realizes a little too late the creature,0.1812686
is indeed a god getting his throat slit by its cloth well there you go,0.5744941
buddy that's what you get for being closed-minded and thinking you're right all the time,0.18182096
he constantly undercut everyone unlike him and never believed them to be his equals and,0.1637111
it's his antiquated privileged mentality that got him killed however it looks like Alisa is,0.51000035
gone mortally wounded by the gunshots the creature then scoops her up diving into the,0.31089434
water the two float together and the creature kisses her as he glows causing Elise's,0.10011412
next stars to form into gills filling with breath under the water then after being,0.07684968
healed is now an underwater breathing creature just like the amphibian man the scars that,0.19048901
once made her different have now been turned into life-giving gills what held her back,0.11580497
before is now what can tweets her inner new form now the two can finally,0.097486794
be together having someone that understands them and accepts them for who they are no,0.20769109
matter who they are if a mute woman or a see God as Deltora himself,0.4504398
said do not reduce a person to one word see the other person listen because,0.083560176
the antidote to hatred is understanding again in antithesis to the classic Universal monster films,0.24106444
where their only destiny was to die the shape of water shows us that sometimes,0.18356432
even monsters are worthy of love and acceptance well that'll wrap it up for my,0.24225621
look at the shape of water sorry if I got a little political or anything,0.077478595
they're not trying to make a grand statement about society or anything but merely exploring,0.07083616
the themes behind the film as presented what did you guys think of the shape,0.030071044
of water and it's ending which del'toro movie is your favorite let me know your,0.10066074
