now I'm from Sacramento born and raised in Sacramento,0.06421601
and so it was cool to watch a movie that shows some of the places that I know and have driven past or visited or whatever it got a little tiring though to constantly hear the reference of Sacramento,0.046410944

and we're still fun to watch Lady Bird as she calls herself is finishing up her final year of high school and it follows her and her relationship with her mom is tumultuous at best and Laurie Metcalf plays her mom and he is wonderful,0.24175851
now she's not likeable because of the tension that exists between the two characters,0.15507068
I think the central point of the story is that where you grow up is actually not as bad as you think it is regardless of where that's at as you get older and as you become an adult,0.15361251
