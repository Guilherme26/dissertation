you you welcome to body thanks for joining me once again and one of the final reviews and may hire my phone I'm i'll be looking at what's considered by manny the first crew horror film and it is none other done the carrot of dr. Caligari and i have been waiting for this one for a long time I'm Frehley getting it i cloaked you bathe for 1245 on xavi but it's all day both how I got there it's solid very very quickly but I came back on again at 12 45 just last week so I had the order it so one of the that price plus my ten percent student discount which means i got it for like 11 pound which was good this was a fantastic release once again from eureka masters of cinema series i've been waiting on this one for like two months i mean i'm so excited and i want to rewatch it end this quality i am seeing this from two and a half maybe even three years at current number he's one of the first heart or one of the first sign of films i ever saw and it left quite an impression on me because scrilla way I understood the German expressionist style and the influence it hard even on Tim Burton which is quite obvious here I'll get into that soon and this I mean this film goes without saying it's just a classic its influence is modern Western flexural German expressionist films while most influential films and cinema i would say special in germany and you can definitely see that for 1920 it's quite visually impressive this honestly is an essential viewing for anyone interested in the history of cinema i'm filming general because you really do see the birth of the genre obviously beforehand there was other shorts and whatnot that would have been made depicting horrific things well this is the first three leap and that's why people called the first three horror film it's really interesting to see I we have some of those generic troops in there of horror hwy 90 such as you know twists twist endings twists in the plot physically challenging the viewer and there you have of course like things like ambiguous and things which we come to know and certain horror films you know is it really over you know things like that in this film you can see it's quite evident the visuals in the film are just spectacular I I mean every single shot you can see the effort and crafted in the account there's been a lot of discussion and to be it but in several pics and stuff about the making of the film as to who it was responsible for this creative style you know it was a rubber team the director was the art director and whatnot freak scene so I'm just gonna go ahead say a collaborator this is a collaborative art piece and a sense and of course the people the handcrafted all those set designs and it was responsible for doing that in each nadeshot you know them exactly already crowded here but I have to say it's absolutely spectacular the interesting thing to note is jevon Expressionism why this is raffle this is considered revolutionary in terms of film German Expressionism in film facially the expressionist movement was effect before on that I haven't seen any picking so I'm just going by what I've learnt in the documentary but you know in terms of visual I can't think of a film before this that looks like this in the slightest everything that this film does is just amazing I mean it was 94 years old still managing to create a haunting and chilling out the sphere and it's still one that is divided for interpretation because there's a lot of ways you can look at it and I'll not support anything but it does have some twists and turns in the story and it makes it really interesting to watch and deconstruct now I would like to move on to my point about how the fellows influence directors like Tim Burton I when we look at sees air thus an ambulance in the film this character here is on the poster you can definitely see some similarities I knew that I spotted it straight away this looks like Edward Scissorhands I mean undoubtedly gonna compare that maybe and you can just even in the style even the way the character moves it's very reminiscent and Edward Scissorhands that's quite like this character and then of course we have the visuals of the film which I know Tim Burton and his autobiography is even stated himself was an influence and you can definitely see that when we look at the ships in his films you know whether it's nightmare before christmas or Edward Scissorhands Beetlejuice you've got those doorways are slanted jagged edges on the sets just just all of that and his stylist it's very reminiscent to films Caligari definitely Caligari knife moving on to what's inside RIT release again nice cover info on the back as usual the booklet is super by having read through it yet but there's some beautiful images I love this artwork this is fantastic artwork we have other artwork in here here we see these air carrying a woman up the hill which is something quite similar to King Cole and Frankenstein carrying away I go you know so that's a precursor to lot now we have an essay on the film no more images here's here's another superb image just beautiful beautiful stuff look there's some posters in here to regular posters of the film I can't seem to find any but yeah imma get like that superb in terms of special features that's fallen again has some pretty good ones in there we have a 60 minute or 50 minute documentary looking at the making of the film and the history of the film we have a 5.1 already score which you can play with sensitive herb I keep using the word superb excuse me for that that's called Caligari the birth of horror in the First World War then we have a video essay by filmmaker and critic david cone's basically talking about you know what's in the film an Atari interesting is quite eye-opening and mixture think about what you've seen in the film so that's worth walking it's only 15 minutes or so then the 44p booklet which I showed you then we have some notes on the restoration of the film in a video format of some German speaking a bite either films important this is a 1080p transfer the film 4k resolution edition of the of the film basically and it looks stunning whenever I first watch the film it was on a diode I was quite shoddy the music was awful music here is grit I'm not sure which side track udders pull it over all yeah this is one of my favorite releases knife from masters of cinema because it's a superb film that I go again using the word superb excuse me for that I need to broaden my vocabulary in this for you the scarlet the Caligari is a thumb you need to see from
