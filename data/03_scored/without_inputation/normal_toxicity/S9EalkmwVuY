we've a wonderful evenings entertainment lined up for you hey what's up guys,0.25040147
this is Stephie,0.1372174
AKA in my humble opinion and welcome back to another iMHO of movie review so in today's video,0.10625759
i'm going to be talking about the newly released,0.053492293
comedy coming-of-age film entitled book smart,0.2435382
so book smarts stars beanie Feldstein caitlin denver Billie lourd Noah Galvin Skyler gasps Ando Jessica Williams Jason Sudeikis Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte the movie is the directorial debut of Olivia Wilde and it was written by Susannah Fogle Emily Halpern Sarah Hoskins and Katie Silverman book smart is about two highschool besties named Amy and Molly and they have worked their asses off to get into the Ivy League's at the cost of having a social life filled with parties and fun,0.40330273
so the school that they attend has this policy of not telling anybody where you're going to college after you graduate and the day before their graduation they are horrified to learn that their peers,0.09197078
who they basically looked down on for partying throughout all of high school also got into Ivy League's and other equally good schools and one of them even has a job offer at Google so AV and Molly taken upon themselves to fit four years of high school partying into one night,0.0957403
and of course a lot of goes down and it makes for a really really entertaining movie so as all my movie reviews I'm gonna be talking about the pros the cons and then I'm gonna be giving my overall rating so here we go alright,0.15543954
so Pro number one for me is the casting,0.094473645
so there's lots of young actors new faces in this movie which is really really refreshing casting for the two leads was perfect spot on the side characters as well we're also really really great like Billie lourd for me among the side characters was a standout every time she literally pops up like quite literally pops up in this movie it's it's such a joy,0.08614375
she's so funny Skylar DiSanto,0.24248126
I've never really watched any of his pre guesswork,0.1555539
he's really funny as well I know I keep saying,0.068182595
they're all really funny but like genuinely they're all really funny the adult cast like Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte play the parents of Caitlyn Denver is great to see Jessica Williams in this as like the cool teacher and then Jason Sudeikis plays their principal who is like so over his job casting and that level of talent for your adult cast just gives this movie the comedic credit that it really does deserve,0.086207904
all right,0.052336596
Pro,0.021102477
number two for me is the chemistry between your two leads,0.11414001
so again,0.050375227
your bleeds are played by beanie Feldstein and Katelyn Denver,0.15335575
they played the two best friends Amy and Molly,0.034631222
I believe the first seen of them is Amy picking up Molly from where she lives to you know go to school just in that first scene alone like just the way that they interact with each other,0.06567861
and like their little inside jokes,0.16328861
you can just tell that there's such good friends they really play off well with one another,0.0519183
and I don't know how much of what they did together was improvised but it feels like they're just like making it up on the spot and aside from obviously the comedic moments the the dramatic scene which is when they fight you really take that to heart and that's seem really it feels very personal,0.10273327
because throughout the movie you have seen what close friends,0.073636234
these two girls are and how far they're willing to go for one another that when they do get to the point in the movie where they have that big dramatic fight scene it feels it feels very heartbreaking and sad my third pro this movie was Olivia Wilde's direction you know what you go girl,0.23833565
I didn't know you had it in you,0.1025494
but apparently you did she directed the out of this movie this movie is so well directed,0.12520473
and it's amazing that this is her directorial debut she made so many interesting artistic choices in the way that you chose to tell this story like for instance when Molly finds out that all the other kids in her school got into amazing colleges,0.059445094
when she loses it,0.1716311
it is,0.030997256
so reminiscent to me of Tracy Flick in election and I feel like by making those subtle references to those other iconic dark comedy teen centric movies you can tell that Olivia Wilde studied movies took what those movies did great and made it her own like she really really did her homework how's the director one of your jobs is to try and get the best performance out of your actress,0.1762422
and I feel like Olivia Wilde was able to get amazing performances it feels like she's definitely an actor's director because she knows that world so well therefore she knows how to communicate to her cast and the acting in general in this movie just came off as so natural all right,0.14413592
my fourth pro to this movie and it's a big one it succeeded,0.11689707
so well in representing,0.05243186
its genre which to me is a coming-of-age teen comedy like I said a million times throughout this entire review this movie is genuinely funny,0.17692566
I pretty much laughed throughout the entire thing and my theatre was laughing out loud with me,0.14475344
the entire movie is a journey because it's these two girls trying to get to this,0.17496075
popular guys house party,0.09500618
so along the way they have a lot of missteps to get to the party and they find themselves in the most random situations but honestly while I was watching the movie I didn't even care if they ended up making the party or not because the getting there was so much fun,0.054063197
and then of course as a coming-of-age movie I definitely felt like there were,0.1027674
so many moments where you saw these characters come of age first of all the ticking clock here is the fact that they're graduating so that's a huge milestone in anybody's life,0.06461252
and then you see both of these girls trying to have like their first sexual experiences,0.63324964
and their friendship throughout,0.056052644
the course of this movie is tested a teenagers in this movie like they acted and sounded like teenagers and 20-19,0.10212264
it's been a while since I've been a teenager but for me my perspective of teenagers in 2019 is that they're so smart and witty and fast they're very socially and culturally aware of what is going on they're a bit on edge and unsure of themselves but I mean who isn't as a teenager and teenagers especially in 2019 are all about being their authentic self,0.10253776
so I really feel like they nailed that persona all right,0.13135707
so now talking about the cons my first itty-bitty con it's very nitpicky is that I did not understand why Amy during their fight,0.101590075
did not how Molly what she saw I just felt like for me the girl seemed smarter than that the movie seems smarter than that,0.27689782
and I get that this was sort of like the friendships breaking point,0.066775635
you know this was supposed to be a high moment of tension for these characters for this story but I just felt like it was so unrealistic that at no point whatsoever while they were fighting Amy would not try to tell Molly what she saw my second con this is a bigger con now is I hated,0.23968823
what they did with Jessica Williams character,0.052422874
for Jessica Williams to be this black woman who is also like the cool teacher in the school was like yes amazing,0.17750922
but then they give her this like really creepy storyline in the movie where after she drives the girls to the party she goes inside the house,0.3073356
this is a high school party by the way and then one of the male students who has like a crush on her starts flirting with her,0.4047776
and then she starts flirting back,0.09698388
and then later on we learned that I guess she slept with him and I'm not quite sure if this high school student is a legal consenting age but still that's really really creepy and I just hate that they gave the only pretty much main cast person of color that's storylines that character deserved better,0.3163193
and Jessica Williams deserved better all right,0.08213254
so my overall rating for this movie is a solid a-minus,0.1189217
this movie is very fun,0.11015638
very entertaining the characters are genuinely funny,0.077587925
and I felt like I was on a wild adventure with them however and this is a big however,0.14213403
and honestly I was debating whether or not to include this particular portion in my cons list because I don't even I don't even know if this is a fair critique and I'm gonna call myself out on it,0.07977584
maybe,0.038781885
this isn't a fair critique maybe I'm just complaining but the movie is very white then I struggle,0.24220912
if that's a valid critique,0.14049077
when I went on like my whole Twitter rampage at 2:00 in the morning questioning if something is - white is a fair,0.24964237
critique I got a variety of responses something,0.06219004
like yeah that is a fair thing to point out but then I got another interesting reply that was like maybe your critique isn't necessarily that it felt white but that it lacked,0.1415323
diverse and the thing is this movie actually technically didn't lack,0.06233209
diversity you have the cold teacher being played by a black woman Molly and Amy's classmates are racially diverse Noah galvans character in this movie he's gay and his friend in the movie is black and,0.2293507
gay I mean like technically they are checking off these like,0.71571094
boxes,0.051742118
I guess to say and I hate I hate putting it in those terms,0.19515705
but sometimes I feel like that's what these movies are doing it's like we're not gonna give like people of color,0.35355395
the main roles we're just gonna give them these side roles to check off the boxes,0.07060962
I don't believe that's what they were doing with this movie but because you positioned those sorts of characters as side characters it kind of feels like that's what is happening here,0.06929334
and I get why this story's about two white girls in high school this story was written by four white ladies the movie is directed by a white lady and your main leads are two white girls,0.32154387
they have every right to tell that story because that's their experience of living in this world and quite frankly they they execute that story so well in this movie but maybe for me that critique of this movie is like to quote-unquote white while that may be true to a certain extent that doesn't necessarily like make it a bad thing,0.16347876
but at the same time it just opens,0.059425812
my eyes to the fact that there is such a lack of coming-of-age movies and centered on a person of colors experience,0.36102712
and especially a young round or black girls coming-of-age experience,0.08178249
I hope by me pointing this out there it's not till start a hate train on this movie,0.2787331
I think this movie is so funny it's so great I genuinely feel like this movie has the potential to be one of those generation-defining movies of its time like you know when we look back on the 80s people think of like what was that iconic teen movie of the 80s it was The Breakfast Club,0.087514184
90s,
you have clueless you also had Dazed and Confused coming out of the 90s even though that portrayed the high school experience in the 70s and then the 2000s you have like Mean Girls and super bad those are iconic teen,0.3571829
comedy movies that really are classics of its genre,0.13305552
and I feel like in 10-15 years time when people are like oh what was it like to be a teenager in 2019 there reference book smart like I feel like that's how good this movie is but at the same token I hope within the next couple of years that there are going to be other movies that will portray a diverse range of coming-of-age experiences for people of color because especially given the climate of 2019 since Hollywood is claiming to be all about diversity,0.12356386
I hope that those movies are actually going to be made,0.08225703
and I feel like all of the brown black kids growing up in 2019 deserve their own coming-of-age movies as well well that's about it for this video,0.6549055
