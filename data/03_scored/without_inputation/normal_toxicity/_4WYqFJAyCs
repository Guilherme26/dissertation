the Moses directed movies like the lobster and the killing of sacred deer two films I really wasn't a big fan of I was really a big fan of those films there weren't my kind of comedies that could really get into the night I just didn't see why if you don't love them so much yet,0.18075904

and yeah Here,0.078655116
I am reviewing it this movie stars Olivia Colman Emma Stone rich a wise and Nicholas Hoult and to be honest this is probably the most tolerable Jarvis la famosa film yeah I know I get that it's an unpopular opinion,0.2008265
and a lot of people love this filmmaker,0.13218169
they think he's genius he's one of the greatest filmmakers working today I disagree,0.24032676
I think Denis Villeneuve who is probably the one of the greatest filmmakers working today but I don't know some people just love them,0.07451014
they just the critics eat them up,0.30514327
and they just think he's jeez I don't see that genius,0.31682822
I just don't I don't really,0.0848436
I don't see it,0.08981323
I don't even think the lobsters even all that original of a screenplay yay it's almost based off,0.18284994
a Simpsons episode actually and killing that a singer dear which is too weird for me Anna,0.43939787
I couldn't get into it this,0.075636275
one was a little more easier to get into because I do love creepies films and I loved this number listen Emmett ography in this film I thought was a very beautifully shot very well laid out film,0.20956343
I like the the color-coding of this film I thought the colors were done really beautiful,0.09703368
and yeah the transitions were really nice the shots were really well laid out and really good obscure camera angles that work for this film the Dutch angles are really cool and stuff some of the weird close-up wide-angle lenses I guess they just work for the wacky tone this films going for,0.21697225
and it does have a message,0.028347563
it does have a meaning message in it,0.043098476
it's very brutal realistic and to the point most of the points a little too unwatchable in a lot of his films,0.31089434
but well maybe what made me like this movie more than the other two was most of the performances,0.08313797
actually I just want to give to the lobster,0.07777183
I just a geeky couldn't really get into the Rachel Weis confederal performances I even the same thing with kale and killing her sacred deer,0.72889924
I couldn't get into those performances,0.15823016
I don't know I just I didn't think they're all that great,0.10957842
a lot of people disagree with me but I didn't think they were all that great the performances in this movie were actually legit really good,0.07759149
I liked Olivia Colman I think she is the stay I know she is a very very interesting character,0.14857097
and I think she does a really great job,0.10860512
I think Rachel Weis is probably one of the standouts I think she's super super funny brings a lot of the dark comedy in this film and the stone was also really great,0.09311375
she has a lot of tragedy with her,0.24086261
she does a lot of the dark stuff really well and I thought Nicholas Hoult was also really good even some of the supporting cast members that I didn't know I thought,0.078936994
I think the acting was really good in this film,0.10860551
he was the direction was pretty good,0.06145931
I felt like a lot of things were accredited pretentious and things as low low artsy,0.15351923
I am oh just look at these fancy stuff,0.1759816
oh yeah and look at how I just say you - Jean Rose and stuff,0.14643711
like oh I really your house Lapidus does try very hard to be unique and original and very,0.06640735
different and you know he's the one that one-of-a-kind,0.111427344
filmmaker and I don't think he really is,0.0770758
honestly I think he does a lot of Stanley Kubrick in a lot of his films and,0.2756977
stuff so I don't think he's credit original and stuff and I think he borrows a lot of Kubrick in this film especially watch like movie like Barry Lyndon stuff a much better film and yeah it comes off very obvious especially if you know Stanley Kubrick I'm like this is very this style is very Kubrick at times it's not very original and stuff and I don't know just this movies kind of getting on my nerves sometimes and sometimes a lot of the times the comedy just doesn't work for me and as much as it was funnier in this one then it wasn't the other,0.08612362
two I still I still got annoyed a lot of,0.09778097
parts there's still a lot,0.05088944
comedy,0.11755226
I just didn't find funny and stuff and I don't I get it's supposed to be despicable just to be despicable on stuff,0.31089434
and it's just weird for the single weird and stuff,0.16645065
I felt like the weirdness did match more than this story than the other two stories but I don't know some of though this filmmaker in his movies I just I can't pulling it into them,0.08013535
I kid I couldn't fully get into this,0.1493099
even though I still liked a lot of aspects of it because I love filmmaking and I love movies and I have to appreciated when he does something really good,0.051393308
and I give him kudos for that but I just can't get into these films every time I watch his films,0.15488186
I don't ever want to watch them again,0.15144432
and it's the same with this one even though I think the favorite is probably my favorite gr Galapagos film I'm still like I never see this movie again it's very unwatchable,0.15008779
it's another one and done,0.052058645
I don't know that's somebody's movies you can't get into them,0.15441212
I think this one is a better movie than killing your sacred gear,0.67781156
in the lobster because it is much funnier has better cinematography,0.08331219
I enjoyed the performances more and I even enjoyed one of the characters a lot,0.06693985
