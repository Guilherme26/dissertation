he recognizes her talents immediately and decides to take a chance on her,0.108063444
hi if you're new here,0.089713715
my name is Shawn Chandler and I started this channel cuz I was driving,0.15502384
everyone around me crazy talking about movies way too much,0.3237911
if you can relate to that that you like to talk about movies more than the people around you,0.05476007
you're probably in the right place and with that in mind,0.13093626
I'd love it if you tell me your thoughts on the movie down below in the comments section are you excited for it have you already seen it did you love it did you hate it all of that fun stuff,0.35651052
let's have a nice lively discussion,0.06910966
with that said let's get started talking about the good probably the absolute best thing about this movie for me is that it really does cover this full spectrum of human emotions,0.11194794
and life experiences like during the first 30 minutes of the movie I was really surprised at just how funny it actually was and then it becomes very romantic at times it's very tragic heavy dark at other points in time in the film and then of course as it is a movie called a star is born,0.031860586
you have these moments of becoming as Lady Gaga's character is fully realized and people discover it by the end of the film you feel like you've gone on a very full emotional journey and been to so many different places that it leaves you very satisfied and a large part of the reason that this movie works is because of the performances everyone in this movie is just absolutely phenomenal,0.061647937
and so much of it boils down to just the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady gaga,0.15341395
you buy this strange interconnected relationship that's complex,0.11599798
each of the characters are nuanced,0.04889005
there's things you love about them,0.085768715
there's things you hate about them,0.31089434
there's things where you just want them so much to do something that they won't do and other times they're doing things,0.119176015
you wish they weren't doing,0.16759829
and all of it makes for this web of relationships the tie into careers that just keep you captivated from beginning to end,0.08476758
and all of them are absolutely convincing as all of this is taking place Bradley Cooper has to be so many different things as this very broken character and times you love him at times you hate him and you see him in so many different lights and he just disappears,0.24220076
the guy that you saw in The Hangover is gone the guy from the a team,0.16932417
isn't there,0.042766366
this is this character brought on to the screen likewise lady gaga plays a character that's taken on a huge journey throughout the film and you would never guess,0.0893237
she's a singer turned actress from watching this film she did really in a new way a star an acting star is born in her performance in this film in some ways,0.13403626
yeah we knew that Bradley Cooper was probably gonna be great on screen as an actor but we didn't necessarily know is how great he was gonna be behind the scenes as the director and he does a bunch of things great here as a storyteller first off,0.06557233
he does use a lot of visual techniques to draw our attention to just the right details,0.053739253
so he learned the information we need not by being told,0.05338467
but by him drawing us our attention to things by focusing in on things that help us to understand what's happening in a visual way,0.07059885
so we start putting the film together and to that point part of what he does so well as a director is he's always hinting at what's about to happen,0.07068178
you don't necessarily know it as lines or ceteris or eyes are drawn to something,0.119480945
but he's always pointing toward us towards what's about to happen and so lines of dialogue will happen,0.07161073
and then two scenes later as the events start to come together,0.070681565
you get a sense of excitement,0.13050222
you get a sense of dread,0.19207695
you get a sense of romance as you start to see how it's fitting together and you're piecing it together,0.19939867
in the good way,0.053492684
you're able to predict something that's about to happen not because the movies predictable but because he's put all the pieces in place,0.15205507
so you have that right sense of anticipation for what's about to happen,0.08444757
and as this is a musical you've got to talk about the music itself and it is of course just phenomenal how much these songs both tie into the themes of the movie itself and are just good songs that you want to listen to once you leave the theater and like I said we didn't know that Bradley Cooper could direct,0.07864591
I didn't know that he could sing,0.09920648
he's he keeps up with Lady Gaga which is quite impressive I'd also highly recommend you check this one out at a theater with a great sound system,0.07508493
I got lucky in the screening,0.079129115
I was that might have the best Soundsystem in all of the Austin area and I mean you felt like you were in a concert when they did these concert sequences,0.24224094
it's just how full,0.056692477
and you could hear the crowd the separation,0.09462292
everything,0.05501403
highly encourage you to check it out at a place with a great sound system with that said let's move on to the mix aspects of the film,0.04323098
and the big thing that comes to mind really is just that the movie changes pretty drastically as it goes,0.079568386
along the first act or so maybe the first 40 minutes of the movie moves it kind of one pace the stories to hold in one fashion,0.04564983
and as soon as things start to kick into action,0.4283759
the way,0.050700083
it's edited the way scenes play out all of it changes,0.06775484
and some of that factors into the nature of the story itself what's going on with the characters and sort of mirrors kind of the changes in their lives and things like that so it makes sense,0.030314205
it's not like it's executed poorly but it is a very big change,0.18508822
so if you love what's happening at the beginning you might be frustrated with what happens as you move into the second and third acts of the film from there,0.0841486
let's move on to the negative aspects of the film,0.07553322
and this is really a continuation of what I just mentioned before but because the pacing changes so much in the relationship dynamics change so much as you transition into the second act of the film some of the storytelling,0.064881355
momentum is lost a little bit,0.16419066
some of the relational dynamics are lost,0.08179107
the chemistry isn't quite as strong because you're not sitting in them quite as much as you were at the beginning you spend a lot of time in individual scenes and sequences and then because things move so much quicker in the second half of the film you're not sitting there as long where's,0.06191531
the first act covers a very small amount of time,0.08139937
the rest of the film kind of montages through big chunks of time,0.09588788
and so there's a cost when you do things like that before I get my final take on this movie be sure to tell me down below in the comment section,0.10548852
what did you think about it did you love it - Jane have you seen it yet all that fun,0.08420307
stuff,0.0564191
I'd love to hear take on this film as for me I'm gonna score this one in a and a nine point five out of ten this was just this is classic great movie for me,0.09591072
