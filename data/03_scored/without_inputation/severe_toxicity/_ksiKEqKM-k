talking about the favorite which I'm so pumped about because this movie is awesome it's,0.034787774
weird it's kind of gritty you don't really know am I supposed to laugh at,0.03578023
this is it supposed to be funny and it's dark it's it's everything that I,0.056936394
wanted from it and more I mean you you watch the previews and you know,0.04458593
that the gals are gonna deliver but this movie when you leave it I'm telling,0.045039583
you you're gonna be like how many Oscars is this gonna win because it is,0.02439295
bomb and I can help wait to talk about it so stay tuned to hear,0.20496836
my thoughts and of course cue the intro all right so let's dive into this,0.042682838
thing you guys know that I love tea and whenever I want to talk about,0.061001997
Old English Victorian all those things there's nothing like a cup of tea my personal,0.18956403
favorite is green tea and but English tea times okay they're T's okay but green,0.064510174
teas a little bit better so let's dive into this thing right so the movie,0.036883105
is about which is based on a true story that I didn't know when I,0.012736271
was going into the film basically it's about this this monarch Queen Anne and back,0.06492126
in the early 1700s she was ruler and but she was best friends with this,0.032252096
girl named Sarah Churchill who is related to Winston Churchill was explained sort of a,0.018837336
lot in terms of their diplomatic excellency and so she's best friends with Queen Anne,0.036643635
and honestly this is true story she had so much influence in court with the,0.023239521
Whigs and with how the Queen would make her decisions and she was very dominant,0.038754266
she's a cold cold person but you could tell she really loved the Queen but,0.10179638
she also loved her influence as well so everything's getting along real well and things,0.050925795
are going great until she finds out that her cousin whom she's never really met,0.18602726
before it's kind of down and out her name's Abigail Hill and she's like alright,0.09755251
um honestly it's a little bit embarrassing that I have this cousin who is basically,0.12370021
you know has a is living in the mud somewhere so I'm gonna allow her,0.2614376
to come to and meet the Queen and become a chambermaid and give her a,0.12594654
job so Abigail Hill is played by Emma Stone and I didn't mention that Sarah,0.023313357
Churchill is played by Rachel Weisz and the Queen Anne is played by Olivia Colman,0.012397028
and so then she allows her cousin to come in and she was not expecting,0.09603057
however that her cousin would be loved by the Queen and then her cousin would,0.16357598
it be just as cunning as she is and that's where all the tea starts,0.039715454
to spill because oh my gosh there's just so much going on it is just,0.06860238
it's just wonderful because they both want the Queen's influence and Sarah is so used,0.017355971
to being HBIC like she looks at Abigail like she's nothing Abigale used to at,0.10783558
some point be a lady but her father fell into her times or something and,0.06615783
she ended up being sold to to someone else and she's no longer lady even,0.10301167
though she was trained to be a lady so in her mind she's looking at,0.045893013
the Queen and this opportunity like hey I get I could possibly get to be,0.045831818
a lady again I get to be in the court I get to meet all,0.05181847
these fabulous men and suitors like I'm not gonna just sit here and let Sara,0.038138304
run all over me and and not take hold of the opportunity and at first,0.11794105
she's really loyal because she thinks that sara is a good person but she's not,0.099322565
and then it all unfolds and unravels and I will leave it there because seriously,0.07795087
guys this drama I was thinking this could have been like a 10 part series,0.058564097
it's fascinating it's so good so let's get to the performances like if Olivia Colman,0.084023334
does not win Best Actress I'll be shocked I mean not only her performance in,0.03807711
terms of emotion vocally like a lot of her bodily performance was impressive as well,0.10805709
because Queen Anne had issues with gout she had a stroke and a lot of,0.05680136
that is physical performance she's also known to be ill throughout her life she gained,0.15070134
a lot of weight later on in her time and it's just I mean Olivia,0.1174701
puts on like a tour de force of what it means to become a role,0.0550353
and how to carry it out on film it's it's crazy and then when you,0.1244226
get Emma Stone and Rachel vice I mean they're just like butting heads they really,0.2684028
play well off of each other the director Rachel vice said that the director told,0.016144672
them please don't read up on your too much history on your actual characters because,0.03179112
a lot of this I won't give exactly what away but some of its fictional,0.032011963
it's just to play up how Abigail and Sarah butted heads but a lot of,0.27137387
it's pretty true so not only is it is it a great film to watch,0.062068287
to see sort of a piece of history and watch how it all unfolds and,0.020120475
then also just the performances are incredible I mean I honestly don't know who's gonna,0.04216067
win between Emma Stone and Rachel vice because they both kick ass and so then,0.76384836
let's talk about the overall style and how the film looks it's strange because you,0.033798646
know that this is based on a true story when I watch this I wasn't,0.015479488
sure because it's so it's almost Tarantino esque in the sense that he will take,0.028691366
a history story but he'll kind of like flip it in his own way to,0.021404944
make it comical and you're not sure am I supposed to laugh at this I,0.06805959
don't know how I'm supposed to be feeling but it's dark it's edgy it's so,0.08529384
different than anything you guys have watched this year you guys have got to check,0.041300587
out this movie wide-angle lenses lots of there's just just how everything is framed and,0.035027906
there's these court and the costumes are gorgeous and all the rooms that they're in,0.053154826
and the palaces are amazing like seriously go see this on the big screen so,0.029744351
you can really look at all the details and enjoy what it means to watch,0.03187028
film that's what this movie is between the acting the sets the directing everything that,0.03408135
you want from a film is in this movie and I know I'm really selling,0.047379036
it and I kind of like weird things I'm not gonna tell you guys this,0.08009942
movie is not weird but there's symbolism there it's a movie that I think will,0.022393407
be taught in a film school because there's so much underlying tones and a lot,0.01835042
of things that are going on and I cannot wait to see it again so,0.022880986
I highly recommend go this weekend I know these next couple weeks we have so,0.02135173
