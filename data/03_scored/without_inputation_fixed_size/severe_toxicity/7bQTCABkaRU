the farewell is written and directed by Lulu Wang and stars aquafina as Billy a,0.016702097
girl living in New York that's with her parents but away from her parents she's,0.05579627
struggling she's kind of a disappointment she hasn't really met the expectations that her parents,0.058799572
have set for her she has a really close relationship with her grandmother living in,0.28979096
China however but then she finds out from her parents that her grandmother does have,0.06021176
cancer and they have yet to tell the grandmother either she only has about three,0.22810514
months to live and they're kind of holding it back so she doesn't have to,0.04398926
live with the stress of dying and the farewell was actually really well done I,0.06360619
was very pleased with this trip to the movie theater I was very surprised I,0.04348372
did not watch a trailer for this I heard this premiered at Sundance and I,0.07059328
think it did pretty well I'm not exactly sure it has a 90% on Rotten,0.123537906
Tomatoes and I actually do think it deserves that rating I don't know about 99%,0.0995587
there are some flaws of this film but I think this film is overall really,0.02546456
well done first off I just want to applaud Lulu Wang and her writing in,0.025618218
this film because she is tasked with a really tough job of dealing with comedy,0.07922869
along with very dramatic beats especially like dealing with cancer like that's tough this is,0.083773896
her story so she did live this this is an actual true story she does,0.03857533
do a really good job telling it and it is a very personal project but,0.010356245
you can tell that she really knows how to work that comedy and drama together,0.054889623
she'll start out with a joke it more towards the beginning of the film and,0.050602514
then like later on about halfway through the film she'll call back to that joke,0.03122505
where you thought that first joke was just like a throwaway line and easy laughing,0.020406503
in the theater but then it plays into the dramatic plot and it makes it,0.03156363
very enriching and it just has a better punch line it almost makes the humor,0.08717032
funnier because it's dark and you shouldn't be laughing at this point but it's good,0.09129845
and it just seems very realistic what characters would actually do and I think that's,0.008612798
the biggest part of this film that I just feel like these are real characters,0.023421116
they really feel like they've lived in this world and this leads to awkwafina where,0.03493478
I haven't seen much of her but what I've seen is very comedic supporting roles,0.042372864
so really not a ton she's really funny but she hasn't really been able to,0.05166681
flex the acting jobs and in this film she does that and more she knocks,0.03288668
it out of the park she is a brilliant actress and I really hope to,0.05964103
see her and more 8:24 you know independent genre type films like this I think,0.09464832
she'll do a really good job and I really look forward to seeing her she,0.054848384
really just hits the dramatic beats you can really feel the divide in herself thinking,0.07320745
whether or not to tell her grandma would be better or just letting her grandma,0.13836485
die happy and you really identify with her and she does like I said she,0.39568165
does a really good job i I really would like to see her be recognized,0.042165328
by the Academy later this year or early next year whatever but anyways Lulu Wang,0.019072145
she does a really good job directing as well she gets a really good performance,0.08547676
out of Aquafina but also the entire cast is a plus caliber here she does,0.08603286
a really good job getting those performances and the entire cast deserves a lot of,0.04954221
credit here they are going full force and it's an entire Chinese cast that's like,0.038599942
I think that's really cool I also think that grandma was hilarious in this film,0.09584365
she actually was almost identical in the way she acts and I thought it was,0.022970786
really funny and I really connected to that part because she's always like hitting and,0.25005406
smacking you calling you stupid but in a very loving manner and I really enjoyed,0.5174327
that it was very it was a good way to connect to the film not,0.025863005
to mention the cinematography and sound design and score was just amazing I think this,0.023874106
is a beautiful film I think beautifully shot film let's be clear there it is,0.104269534
a beautiful film as well but the score was really good as well I it,0.028369417
really stood out to me they use a lot of piano and strings and it,0.047249325
almost reminded me of the favorite just last year which is I think another 8:24,0.021790085
film could be wrong but Billy's characters he played the piano but she doesn't anymore,0.035996415
and I there's something there when the piano is playing and it just really transforms,0.015442238
you into the mindset that she's going through and just enhances her performance even more,0.09895338
and I just think top to bottom this film is really great and it's very,0.06323169
well constructed however there are a few things that stood out to me that I,0.035935216
didn't like so much like I said there is a cancer subplot and I feel,0.18703368
like this film structurally is familiar and I it's a nitpick there's just a few,0.03140997
things like you know with her struggling with money and stuff like that it's just,0.05228011
kind of like it seems a bit of a cliche when it comes to movies,0.062041678
like this you know or dramas in general that and the third act is a,0.023954593
little it's paced a little slowly there are a lot of just hanging out giving,0.21524012
speeches and drinking that just doesn't seem necessarily you know completely necessary but at the,0.008597499
end of the day with the farewell having you know slight mishaps towards the end,0.046921387
of the film I think it was really great I really connected to a lot,0.036407497
of these characters they're very compelling they have really tough things they're going through and,0.022829102
decisions they have to make I think it's a very beautiful film I think it's,0.049796313
touching and if I had to choose one word to describe the farewell I would,0.04367862
say it's emotional but in the good way but what did you think of the,0.014021406
