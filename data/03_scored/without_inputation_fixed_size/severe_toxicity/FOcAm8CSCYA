greetings fellow Gor house and welcome back to another blood-splattered vlog so I just got,0.29843926
back from Wonder Woman the latest entry in the DC Cinematic Universe I guess it's,0.03592657
called anyway this is a movie that I've been anticipating with a lot of hesitation,0.042457342
and by that I mean I've been very weary about this film and the reason,0.036609713
why I've been so weary is because on one hand I hated Batman V Superman,0.070053816
and Man of Steel and this movie's supposed to be a continuation of the universe,0.026210232
that those two films started but on the other hand Suicide Squad was pretty fun,0.100848496
despite being a complete and utter mess from start to finish and on top of,0.1285953
that the trailers for this movie made this movie look great especially the latest trailer,0.047007862
that was released a few weeks ago that one was phenomenal but even so I've,0.026035288
been burned before there have been many movies where the trailer was fantastic and I,0.26284847
ended up extremely disappointed in the theater in fact I would put Man of Steel,0.0954013
right on that list but now I have finally seen Wonder Woman and now that,0.021072352
I have I can say without any hesitation that Wonder Woman is wonderful this is,0.048270382
the kind of movie I've been wanting DC to produce ever since they started this,0.038414355
idea of a DC Cinematic Universe they brought to life one of their most iconic,0.048239782
characters in an extremely faithful way while still doing a little bit of their own,0.032711737
thing but not in any way that takes away from the original core of the,0.020234222
character this is still Wonder Woman she's still fighting for truth she's still fighting for,0.060076725
justice she's still fighting for love in fact the core theme of this movie could,0.051026236
really be summed up with love not war this is one of the best superhero,0.050108284
movies ever made I put this up there with some of my favorites like spider-man,0.06297227
2 and The Avengers 2 movies that got to the core of their characters and,0.0117690945
brought them to life in a way that I never thought was possible and this,0.08579273
movie did that with Wonder Woman and oh my god I was cheering in the,0.058937266
theater multiple times and one of the things I really like is that the director,0.014344686
of this movie took the visuals that Dec Snyder was doing with the Batman V,0.029098459
Superman movies and added more color to it so that it wasn't completely like dire,0.06563433
and dark the whole time this movie saved it's d saturated scenes for scenes where,0.040231638
it's appropriate like the war scenes but for the scenes were Wonder Woman is saving,0.04014317
the day that's when her colors are shining brightly on the screen and it's beautiful,0.038623225
in fact every frame of this movie is gorgeous and the writing matches that beauty,0.02862751
and so does the acting and so does the score everything about this movie is,0.022282988
perfect they even have one the best fight scenes I've seen in a superhero movie,0.054885633
since the fight scene between spider-man and Doc Ock on the train which for me,0.09313768
that fight scene is the crown jewel of all superhero fight scene so the fact,0.046993893
that this would be managed to match that is amazing may I take that back,0.03427292
it's not amazing it's wonderful and that's another thing this movie has action in spectacle,0.05860667
that's almost on par with what's in Man of Steel except in this case you,0.04510278
actually care because this movie makes you not only feel for Wonder Woman herself but,0.032767612
also the side characters around her and all the random people she's saving I couldn't,0.033597097
give two shits about anyone in Manas feel especially Superman but here there were points,0.6495221
where I was so excited that I can feel my heart beating out of my,0.23831661
chest out of just pure adrenaline and the cherry on top of this utterly delicious,0.1678072
cake is at the end of the movie they included the shot that I've been,0.04736174
waiting for since they said they were going to do a Wonder Woman movie and,0.03341417
that is of course the iconic shot of her lifting up a tank with her,0.16534603
bare hands and the moment that happened in this movie I stood up in the,0.035338547
theater and cheered as loud as I could and I wasn't alone a lot of,0.032010633
the other people in the theater with me also cheered so yeah my fellow gore,0.07195092
hounds I know it's not a horror movie I know it's not bloody I know,0.23113635
it's pg-13 but a good movie is a good movie and Wonder Woman is a,0.05831665
great movie so go check it out in theaters and if you would like to,0.07355934
listen to the Wonder Woman soundtrack I will include an Amazon affiliate link in the,0.027123528
description below and if you click that link and buy the soundtrack from that link,0.0295734
then I will get a kickback from it and with all that said my fellow,0.12879951
gore hounds let us move on to this spoilers alrighty then so this movie is,0.07632783
bookended by a prologue and an epilogue of Wonder Woman in the modern day and,0.011732509
she receives this package from Bruce Wayne that includes a picture of her from World,0.04370789
War 1 and upon seeing this picture and her standing with her old team from,0.29384866
back then she starts reminiscing about her origins so we flash all the way back,0.05339163
to when she was a little girl living on some mascara the amazon island and,0.10822671
she's just an adorable rebellious little who desperately wants to learn how to fight but,0.2584532
her mom who also happens to be the queen does not want her to but,0.22810143
her mom's sister disagrees because she believes there's going to become a day where diana,0.3100048
is going to have to learn to defend herself and luckily for diana her happens,0.034246314
to be the greatest warrior the Amazons have ever seen so her aunt starts training,0.02564549
her in secret much to the chagrin of her mother we flash forward a few,0.122850105
years to win Diana as a teenager and her mom finds out and gets really,0.11739028
mad at her sister but her sister insists one more time that diana is absolutely,0.23530991
going to need to defend herself one day so she needs to train her and,0.03743321
this time her mom realizes that there's no way she's going to stop this so,0.11128057
she reluctantly agrees and this is when the real training begins we then flash forward,0.015748223
once again to Diana as an adult after a shit-ton of intense training in fact,0.54336935
they even say that they trained her harder than any other Amazon before her including,0.049137782
her aunt who like I said is supposed to be the greatest warrior the Amazons,0.063728586
I've ever seen so far but now that she's an adult she must prove herself,0.05499206
to her mom by defeating her aunt but she lets her guard down because it's,0.24401617
her aunt which causes her aunt could flip out on her and just start hitting,0.6432628
her with some really harsh tough love but when Diana blocks with her bracelets they,0.060205773
have like a Dragonball Z style like energy burst burst out of her which causes,0.06665007
her aunt to get knocked on her ass and the rest of the Amazons around,0.8062512
her to look at her in fear she then runs off understandably emotionally distressed at,0.08349053
what just happened and she happens to run over to this cliff just as this,0.113841526
by plane this World War 1 by plane breaks through the barrier that surrounds the,0.06395807
island and just crashes into the bay and she runs out to save the pilot,0.043765094
and of course the pilot turned out to be Trevor's who in the comics was,0.015498114
the man who essentially triggered Wonder Woman to leave the island which is essentially what,0.19454493
happens here she saved Trevor's just as the Germans break through the barrier to get,0.046540238
to him there's this gorgeous and super intense action sequence on the beach as the,0.04437174
Germans and the Amazons collide and of course with the help of Trevor's the Amazons,0.05778118
end up winning but not before Diana's aunt takes a bullet for her and she,0.098469794
dies in a legitimately moving scene you actually care about this end even though she's,0.25935677
only been in the movie for about 15 minutes which just tells you how great,0.045002334
the storytelling is in this movie that you care so much about this character with,0.03594187
so little screen time just god damn it's so good so anyway the Amazons use,0.43694147
the lasso of truth on Trevor's which gets him to admit that he was a,0.017369276
spy for the British government and that he had infiltrated this one German base and,0.12511505
discovered this super secret bio weapon that they had planned on using on the western,0.1346345
front a weapon so chemically corrosive that it literally dissolves gas masks so there ain't,0.09030067
no escaping it you're gonna die if it's unleashed and of course Diana upon warning,0.61451375
about world war one believes it's her sacred duty to go out there and stop,0.17999403
this war because according to the story her mom read to her at the beginning,0.17459407
of the movie when she was a little girl most it's not all wars are,0.095750526
a result of Ares the God of War and the Amazons are the sworn enemy,0.17832643
of Ares in fact their island was built to protect this one sword called the,0.045193244
god killer which was apparently created by Zeus for the sole purpose of killing Ares,0.57007676
because apparently a long time ago Ares much like Lucifer declared war on the heavens,0.22568189
and he ended up killing all the other gods in the process with the single,0.6774463
exception of Zeus though you never actually see him in this movie so Diana decides,0.049230907
she's going to go to the world of man and she's gonna find Ares and,0.21890928
stop this war her mom really doesn't want her to do it but diana is,0.31258327
not one to listen to anyone but herself and i love her for it she,0.09217516
is a stubborn badass so she takes the lasso of truth she takes the Wonder,0.37774628
Woman outfit and she takes the god killer sword and they take off on a,0.31713712
boat to London so I'm not exactly sure where sem máscara is supposed to be,0.07272785
because they arrive at London really fast which I suppose I could complain about that,0.022306934
but I love the movie so much as that minor weird thing didn't really bug,0.031407975
me at all so when they get to London they decide they need to get,0.023599386
new clothes because he's still dressed like a German pilot and she looks like warrior,0.18887557
princess and they need some sort of normal street clothes so that they can blend,0.075073294
in with the rest of the city so they have this really funny scene where,0.023627989
Trevor's his secretary is getting her to try on all these outfits but she's like,0.030173395
breaking them and ripping them because they don't quite work with her movements and yeah,0.4125817
we've kind of seen seems like this before the entirety of Encino man is basically,0.02689537
this scene in a nutshell but it's funny and I really enjoyed it hell did,0.3597489
I just bring up Encino man in a Wonder Woman review what's wrong with me,0.0693148
so anyway they meet up with Trevor's commander and he refuses to actually go through,0.01955773
with stopping this chemical weapon because apparently they're really close to peace and they don't,0.08434529
want to ruin that good faith by sending troops into German territory which pisses off,0.44414765
Diana and I love the scene where she screams at all those generals in that,0.1616516
room it is great so Trevor's decides that they're going to go into German territory,0.07185979
themselves but first they need a team and this right here is the part of,0.014792354
the movie that feels the most like Captain America the First Avenger because Trevor's introduces,0.025942827
her to this group of misfits that essentially kind of feel like the Howling Commandos,0.25337532
Captain America but before they leave one of the aristocrats who was in that meeting,0.14766678
with all the generals and was preaching for peace he shows up and pledges his,0.088219315
secret support to trevor's and a team and then off they go to the Western,0.020924017
Front where we get one of the greatest superhero moments in superhero movie history where,0.034388
Wonder Woman learns about no man's land seize all the victims of no man's land,0.058509555
and decides to end no man's land she climbs out of the trench and stands,0.06500374
tall as all the Germans are shooting at her and she's deflecting the bullets with,0.35677668
her armed guards and it's just awesome this is like aw man this is what,0.1412012
superhero movies are all about and goddamn it I'm going to stop the point by,0.4004325
point synopsis here because this movie is just too good to spoil one thing I,0.041240055
will say though is that Ares is actually in this movie and he has an,0.026524197
amazing fight scene with Wonder Woman and he is a character that I kind of,0.050069705
figured was going to end up being Ares from the get-go because when Diana's mom,0.106048234
tells her about Ares as a detail she gives about Ares and there's only one,0.048507188
character over the course of the movie who matches that detail so it was really,0.019085448
obvious to me who Ares was over the course of the movie but to some,0.040475093
other people it might be more surprising anyway just goddamn I have to end this,0.49560288
