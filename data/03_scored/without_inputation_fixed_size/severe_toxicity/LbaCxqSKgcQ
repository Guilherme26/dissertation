a plotline that's gonna appeal to me unless I don't know the school is being,0.044491474
taken over by rebel forces or they all turn to zombies but the notion of,0.06627158
me personally being able to connect with a teenage girl in a story like this,0.07080747
is a long shot I could still very easily enjoy the film I just think,0.047212075

connect with the main character her internal anxieties genuinely resonated with me and I absolutely,0.048553083
love the journey this story took me on I think this film thrived on three,0.04666463
things the performances the progression of the storyline in the national tone of the dialogue,0.024984963
I had the pleasure of being able to moderate an in theater Q&A after the,0.013291035
film with the lead actresses Elsie Fisher and Emily Robinson and they really did provide,0.020858163
a ton of insight to the methodology behind the filmmaking process in this project this,0.020981222
is the first full feature film for writer director Bo Burnham and I asked them,0.01684378
about the dialogue and Burnham's improvised approach and they've really cemented that notion they talked,0.016920941
about Burnham's mentality of warning the kids to be kids and wanting them to be,0.19852938
the ones who told the story from their perspective Burnham didn't always want the dialogue,0.01340212
to come through him from his perspective they eluded to certain scenes where he would,0.11838207
just toss out a topic and let the performers converse naturally they also spoke much,0.06979506
more in depth he wanted to have the interactions between their two characters specifically to,0.020516925
be much more improvised and I thought it was great because it resulted in a,0.025614226
lot of natural jitters and gestures that really did capture the genuine awkwardness between two,0.024253925
kids of their age perfectly and the more they spoke on the process of shooting,0.31743276
this film the more it solidified why their characters were so easy to connect with,0.01776639
because they weren't necessarily characters all the time and rarely did it feel like they,0.013044916
were delivering lines of dialogue I think this focus on wanting the characters and the,0.022312256
storyline to feel much more natural are what made this that intimate film that's gonna,0.08101006
sweep you up into this story that it's telling you it doesn't amplify moments for,0.043173745
the sake of cinematic storytelling and it doesn't stray into melodramatics when it very easily,0.05884747
could have it was comical at times but it didn't force the laughs and the,0.021037763
script didn't try to land jokes the humor was effectively delivered through just many organic,0.013612318
situations we have all experienced in one way or another which is why they're comical,0.032514177
there is no studio vibe here the framing of the shots and the lighting is,0.052910704
all very simplistic and I think it complements the storyline perfectly to make you as,0.050644424
the viewer feel like you're kind of peeking in on someone's life and watching it,0.07744733
evolve much more than it feels like you're watching performers filling out characters I thought,0.03801591
all the various relationship dynamics were grounded they were sincere and the result is subtle,0.014578165
but very heartfelt and emotionally engaging the main character is simple she's normal most of,0.03773454

90% on the entertainment meter it was extremely well done it utilizes a vibrant musical,0.022512475
score to add another element to the storytelling and I think my only minor nitpick,0.04477684
about this film was that I wanted some more I wanted a little bit more,0.070465565
between the characters of Kayla and Olivia and possibly a little bit more backdrop to,0.08521734
Kayla's family life but otherwise it was a well-crafted film with charming performances and it,0.08052181
