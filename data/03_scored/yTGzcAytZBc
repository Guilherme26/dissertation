hey there folks welcome to spectrum pulse we talk about music movies art and culture,0.08866436
and today in another unscripted movie review we're gonna be talk about the newest film,0.10685792
from Pixar Coco so I'm a big Pixar fans surprising nobody I think anybody who,0.1862448
goes into Pixar especially these days they've got such a market and storied catalogue of,0.063687086
phenomenal movies and triumphs of animation that I'd be hard-pressed to find somebody who is,0.09610743
not a pretty diehard Pixar fan yeah the cars movies they're not great they're primarily,0.15214336
there to sell merchandise and there have been some duds I can admit that but,0.19013344
when you take a look at things like the Toy Story trilogy ratatouille wall-e inside,0.1861442
out especially oh my god that movie gets me this day there's a lot of,0.12741457
depth and thematic exploration and a stunning amount of nuance that you don't typically see,0.06825374
in other Animation particularly in stuff that's more marketed towards kids and I can appreciate,0.13311009
that I definitely respect that Pixar is willing to take some chances going through some,0.05204726
pretty dark material there's a surprising number of Pixar films that explore death with a,0.1515747
lot of frankness that I definitely respect and thus it doesn't surprise me to a,0.13792385
certain extent that Coco got released which takes a lot of the celebration around es,0.18031336
de los Muertos and then builds a fascinating way to connect the real life to,0.2580774
the afterlife and what might come after while entrenched in Mexican culture now let me,0.17471515
stress is rather the gate this movie is genuinely great I'm a big fan of,0.050403044
it I want you guys to all see this now and it's also one of,0.088188596
those movies I really don't want to spoil because there's some movies where you can,0.13011242
say that the twist comes in and you spoil it it doesn't really bother you,0.07537235
all that much because it's more of a twist that is more intellectually satisfying and,0.155225
to discuss the twist brings a lot into whereas this one the twist you can,0.052641656
go man if you've seen a lot of family movies if you've seen a lot,0.10708566
of Pixar movies you could probably Telegraph it I certainly was able to but when,0.09234331
it comes to the emotional nuance underpinning a lot of that I don't want to,0.072716504
spoil that because again this is a genuinely great movie and I really recommend you,0.11515966
guys go out and see it it's already breaking box-office records in certain spots you,0.10424621
know what for a movie in this I think it deserves to cuz yeah it,0.16937365
is that good so let me give you a little bit of an outline of,0.12528346
the story the main character Miguel he's a young kid growing up in a family,0.08057696
of shoemakers like his great great grandfather he wants to be a musician he wants,0.2866425
to play guitar he wants to be part in that Mexican culture and maybe mariachi,0.15647659
it's hard to tell but at the same time he also realizes that his grandmother,0.22462893
is very much against that because his great-great-grandfather reportedly abandoned them would you often seek,0.053751763
his fortune become a musician so when he eventually has a clash with his family,0.15162885
he runs off finds an instrument a very special instrument from a man that he,0.24203667
thinks is his grandfather because that man was the greatest musician in all of Mexico,0.15155248
at that time and then things get a little strange because he discovers there's a,0.058947828
way through that time a deal dos Marcos travel back to the land of the,0.056853294
dead now let me stress this right out of the gate the animation is gorgeous,0.45449528
it's more stylized sure and there are ways that some people could argue that it,0.07242851
ties into it might feel culturally insensitive it was handled by the wrong people but,0.18904068
I don't see that whatsoever primarily because it feels like this movie was made with,0.062682636
somebody with the frankness to frame everything as a very Mexican story told and written,0.07270777
mostly by Mexicans there's lots of elements of unsettled Spanish which I really appreciate in,0.38320625
terms of in jokes it's a pretty overall funny movie but there's a lot of,0.0918989
that that makes you think that it is primarily marketed for a Latin audience honestly,0.034329265
I'm okay with that the fact that you can still get the gist the fact,0.107615136
that the emotional three line is as strong as it is Thank You Pixar is,0.049789943
a great credit to this story but the thing is as much as I like,0.043780625
that and as much as the music plays such a element in here it ties,0.053507976
into two themes that I do want to discuss briefly as much as I can,0.05284981
without spoilers because the primary theme really is surrounding family and what role you are,0.0708789
given as a part of your family and how you might want to buck against,0.15413643
it I really do appreciate the level of nuance that's brought to the table here,0.07519234
because everyone is looking out for their best interest within the family unit there is,0.028980872
an element that these people genuinely do love each other so when the grandmother wants,0.13957067
to for bid Miguel from pursuing music it comes from a place of deep-seated hurt,0.10856195
and pain that she wants to try to bomb over because of how her mother,0.66605735
got left behind there's a lot of emotional pace that runs through that storyline and,0.058825318
the family does become the root of so much of this question especially when placed,0.08395782
opposite the other theme which is exploring what it is to become an artist and,0.10556009
what you have to give and give up in order to do so because yeah,0.08152999
there was a musician who left his family in this story and the consequences of,0.062780336
what that is and what art he created and where that art becomes properly attributed,0.10070801
if at all in order to discuss legacy going forward in other words where that,0.040242314
art how it might be remembered or whether the artists won't wind up getting forgotten,0.0684908
that becomes a very potent through line through the story and that whole underlying theme,0.048393536
of memory how people think of somebody either alive or very much dead and whether,0.18573055
that memory could be potentially misconstrued or potentially there are gaps in it or what,0.05703687
it truly means to be forgotten especially in that arc of a family that's potent,0.08747985
as hell and honestly as someone who does have very close ties to my intimate,0.6796735
family that did hit pretty hard especially when it comes to the ending cuz yeah,0.25961906
this is one of those movies where especially if you have that tight-knit family experience,0.13556193
or you want to have that tight-knit family experience that it's a bit of a,0.13010232
tearjerker and you know what that transcends cultural boundaries I completely admit that especially with,0.092682146
the undercurrents of bucking against fam maybe to pursue a passion now I can't say,0.1538344
I completely love this movie but it's not one of my favorite movies of the,0.09035482
year I do think it's sofa matically resonant I think its target audience will absolutely,0.13553153
adore it and I'd give it all the credit in the world for that at,0.07820329
the same time a lot of it is bounded in Latin and mariachi music and,0.03874096
a lot of that aesthetic and personally just for me that's not an aesthetic I,0.098642476
entirely love I will admit that it's just a personal play it doesn't do a,0.08621134
lot for me but at the same time for the audience for which it will,0.061351698
resonate and I like how much it is subtly updated and modernized it doesn't feel,0.08973563
anachronistic at all I do appreciate that definitely it feels like a lived-in grown experience,0.07686296
and when the music is on its point at its most authentic and organic it,0.056531902
does sound beautiful and the whole discussion of again tying into artistic attribution taking what,0.13317989
could be a simple song and magnifying it and blowing it up beyond its necessary,0.40317577
proportions I do love the tragic ironies and consequences that come with that it is,0.10782204
truly remarkable when it sees that element of the artistic process and how it could,0.033174146
be misconstrued but also there one moment that I will say is that it deals,0.05044115
a lot with memory if you have anybody who is older in your life who,0.37697396
is struggling with memory who is struggling with that know losing their memory or potentially,0.11979391
facing Alzheimer's yeah the ending is gonna get you well actually most of this movie,0.15220647
will get to you I love that Pixar doesn't balk away from that sadness I,0.09394648
don't think they pull their punches here I don't think the punch quite hits as,0.15205906
hard as it does for Toy Story 3 or wall-e or there's a couple movies,0.09916108
that will have harder inside out personally for me especially ratatouille if you understand the,0.24718283
ending coming as a critic that you get why that one cuts but at the,0.12769298
same time for Coco there are elements I'm not sure it hits entirely as deeply,0.08834449
because again when you're dealing with the real life and the afterlife the fact that,0.08161571
they are able to give stakes to the afterlife part of the movie is impressive,0.06050841
but at the same time it does slightly undercut the possibilities especially when memory becomes,0.07156636
so much of the key of this story but at the same time for a,0.031114655
kids movie for a movie in this vein that can still be very much enjoyed,0.3024791
and appreciated by adults especially given the audience that it's pitched to I can see,0.03818979
this being really powerful and really resonating for me I might not love it the,0.15742557
same way but again I can appreciate the audience that will it's a light a,0.02614705
tight n definitely recommended go see this film I think a lot of the voice,0.2222899
acting is terrific the jokes are on point especially the ones that are tied into,0.09257075
music and the artistic process that really got to me and yeah it is a,0.07289637
bit of a tearjerker I can omit that it's it's a Pixar movie you get,0.23264556
what you come for but beyond that I definitely recommend you check out cocoa and,0.090020575
by the way that title it might be a little bit surprising when you figure,0.07997352
out why it's called that until you realize that cocoa is the emotional locus of,0.040323276
really the entire film and that's powerful in and of its own right you'll understand,0.08991521
when you see it I don't want to give anything away but yeah thanks a,0.07714394
lot for watching you like to like and subscribe I'd be more than grateful if,0.041543193
