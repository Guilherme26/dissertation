oh boy what's going on that day YouTube this is SEL zero feature zero representing,0.056890495
James yes I'm about to review the most anticipated movie of the year 2017 Star,0.014260207
Wars the last Jedi here we go all rights to go first off Ron Johnson,0.0531362
de directed looper came on talked about how he was like vicious and wanted to,0.08326303
change the scope of how this movie's gonna be worked as far as the Star,0.024704255
Wars franchise as far as this guy Walker Stan fries then opposite from what they've,0.05647143
been doing with anthology films and then on top of that he's been confirmed doing,0.043290816
his own trilogy from what he was able to do with this I'm very intrigued,0.037874226
what he's gonna do with his own trilogy because he would do if he was,0.06781614
ever the directors very well but let's go ahead to the different things about the,0.02055484
movie from the set pieces from the set designs to the practical effects to the,0.018340444
practical creatures and the lifelike things throughout the entire movie this was a very well,0.03275697
made sci-fi film like as far as just the production design the scope it was,0.03367625
beautiful some of the moments like really surprised me everything with the temple the Jedi,0.048716053
Temple location on the island I thought was just amazing some of the imagery they,0.023510916
were able to do with ray and with Luke and different time jumps and different,0.012923188
thought processes of how things are happening what things are happening are just amazing like,0.018511396
they're very much so inspiring to actually watch and see towards the third egg there's,0.09368247
this one moment on this planet is basically made of salt I've never seen anything,0.04569745
like this in a Star Wars film that off the gate I can promise you,0.04051301
you're gonna be like wow the very opening of the movie there is amazing like,0.036634322
battle sequences some of the probably the best battle sequences they've ever had in any,0.023599386
Star Wars movie and throughout the movie like a the way they actually able to,0.021531995
do the cinematography there were moments I was like yo what's about to go down,0.050645754
the sea this movie is excellent it's actually superb it certain difference extends from the,0.023370562
way they would do certain things I'm trying not to say too much this is,0.022824446
a non school to review of course as far as the soundtrack the soundtrack to,0.0293938
me was better than the force awakens but it doesn't elevate it to that upper,0.018098317
level you know to where I've seen John Williams go but this is definitely a,0.015375054
step up and in the right directions there are certain moments where the music you,0.02544394
change the shifts when there is dialogue between two certain characters and definitely the sequences,0.012858665
wherever is on the island whenever is actually in space and whenever like supreme Snoke,0.04777881
is brought into the fold into this movie I'm not going to talk to you,0.078703865
about anything what the characters are doing but I can definitely say from a performance,0.020341316
standpoint this is definitely Mark Hamill's possibly his best since the Empire Strikes Back performance,0.020403178
of Luke Skywalker like he nails the sky work if you've ever doubted you know,0.081568144
what he was able to do what he should be what you think you should,0.05472732
go regardless of what direction Luke is being platformed into this movie Mark Hamill nails,0.076373726
it Daisy Ridley again powerhouse the sings that it was weird there was one scene,0.06023371
in the dark that surprised me because they really just acted it so well like,0.0731988
that motion was just dripping and it was like a dark sequence I don't think,0.05585414
I've ever seen like a well cried out moment like that in the dark this,0.087983176
actually been filmed um Adam driver was given a lot to do in this one,0.040441833
as far as acting and ability physicality they gave him a lot to work with,0.046572834
in this one um John boyega towards the third act I really loved what they,0.04830098
did with him but as far as what they do with his character that is,0.015859975
where I started getting to nitpicks and possibly negativity standpoint just because of the way,0.035098415
that they platform his arc as opposed to Wade they platform his art in the,0.050284557
force awakens I don't like necessarily what they did with the connection of his character,0.041055135
to everything is happening but I did enjoy the entertainment value of him interacting with,0.03279156
this new carryin rose and what they had to do and him his self-assurance about,0.08439185
who he's supposed to be Pro Dameron had to me a better arc than what,0.023585416
they did with Dom boyega's character and Finn in this one because I can see,0.068630986
where Poe is going you know I'm saying and oh my gosh r.i.p to Carrie,0.104288824
Fisher because see I don't call her goddess but what they were able to do,0.049830902
with her it was beautiful it was beautiful there is a negative that I can,0.15112773
say about what they did with her character in certain instances that I feel like,0.012377072
this is where I get into the negatives of the film I feel like the,0.020642644
film is so ambitious has so much potential of story weight and elevation that I,0.047911182
felt like they pulled back you know I'm saying the punch like there were certain,0.19880344
moments in this movie that like I never saw coming there are certain revelations that,0.031354096
I was just like what but at the end of the day from the storage,0.020401848
standpoint of this movie it was everything that I wanted it to be from the,0.03319466
battles from the action to the process of what the Skywalker's have been dwell with,0.032750316
this whole entire under lock of you know the first order and Snoke like you,0.22467507
get all these boasts of information and these great performances and these consequences that are,0.02709426
built in literally you can see them like right in front of you right in,0.054023556
front of your face but in the end of the day when I leave the,0.2831648
movie there are questions that I'd literally marked on the page of paper like five,0.038587302
different questions only two of those questions got answered and when I was hoping for,0.010249815
and those two questions weren't what I wanted what what I thought were gonna be,0.032203536
and then the other three never got answered it's stuff oh I left the movie,0.025396047
with more questions and because I left the movie with more questions I don't know,0.0387995
where to rank this movie I don't even know if I necessarily can give this,0.03671481
movie a rating but I'm gonna try my best with that because I love business,0.043440484
of this film I love the way it was directed I love the way the,0.04509014
performances were in his movie I love the fights I love the battles I haven't,0.069585524
told you guys anything about the meat of this when I get to my school,0.057493154
review there are certain Easter eggs are certain moments dude they I just cannot Oh,0.04547661
but at the end of the day I can't say that this is the best,0.016287021
a kid I just I personally I personally cannot because of some of the questions,0.05539849
the answers I got to the questions didn't merit of positive reinforcements response and then,0.020272803
some of the questions I happen of course witness didn't get answered and now there's,0.020042649
more questions because now I have no idea where this is going to go and,0.025204474
at the end of the day I put myself in the shoes of those you,0.06888841
know back in the 70s when they looked at between a new hope and Empire,0.017898096
Strikes Back or in-between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi where you just,0.037591524
kind of just like what happens now like that is how I feel and if,0.032570053
you're able to do that and convey that as a director you've done your job,0.029261429
that's why I say that he is merited a franchise because go ahead give me,0.053028442
another trilogy and make me think make me want to have questions but I think,0.086482525
that if some of those questions would have just wait for that gut punch and,0.20052095
just went there and took it specifically there are certain moments in the third eye,0.026248146
I felt like that should have went a totally different way because there are two,0.02854569
different characters and the way that they're gonna be platformer no next is four different,0.020941311
characters and the way they're gonna be platformed next I don't know that it makes,0.028304895
sense and that's all I can say I'll give this move a point five out,0.020708498
of ten I want to give it a nine but I'm gonna wait on that,0.05950201
so I'll rest out of nine but I'll pull back and say eight point seven,0.029043913
it was a really good movie I really enjoyed it thoroughly I cannot wait to,0.053573225
watch it again this is my most anticipated movie this year but I think that,0.018462172
I shouldn't have had as many questions as I do have and that's not to,0.017632687
discourage anybody you're gonna go into this movie you're gonna enjoy you we see this,0.18993454
movie and IMAX the visual effects are great the performances are great you're gonna get,0.021434877
so much out of this and the richness of it you know especially if you've,0.049292102
seen the force awakens and if your songs been this definitely elevates you moving forward,0.041618545
but you're gonna ask yourself a lot of perplexing questions about things that happen with,0.01751362
certain characters things that don't have my certain characters and then questions about the background,0.022954822
of certain characters where I feel like if a little bit of background a little,0.034966044
bit of foundation was kind of like late in this movie for certain characters dude,0.034849636
it would merit anyway you want to take any of these characters personally so that's,0.050267927
all I gotta say hopefully y'all enjoyed this review keeping a lot JVs Wingstop there,0.034700636
will be a full review coming very soon in addition to that on the 17th,0.028464539
we're gonna be doing a spoiler discussion keep it alive JVs we ain't gonna stop,0.090310656
