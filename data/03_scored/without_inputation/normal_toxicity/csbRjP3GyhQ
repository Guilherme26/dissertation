hi and welcome to residues today i'm going to be reviewing Logan Logan is the tenth installment in the x-men franchise and it's a very light adaptation of the graphic novel old man Logan which is one of my favorite comics the film is set in the future,0.04482866
we find an old and ailing Wolverine taking care of an older more alien Professor X as they try to hide out from the world however they are swept into action when they have to take care of a young usage was on the run from an evil corporation this movie is one of my most anticipated movies of the year because i love the trailer for the film I'm talking specifically about the Johnny Cash trailer when I saw the trailer for this movie I thought two things either this film is going to be amazing all the person who make the stranger deserves an Oscar for it because it's incredible,0.2457167
and now that I've seen the movie I can face that the trailer is very very accurate,0.07241352
if you've seen that trailer,0.07643554
you understand what the film is about and you also get the exact food and feel of the film this is a gut-wrenching powerful emotional,0.09053749
beautiful film,0.05796528
it's like the dark knight of Marvel films in the definite transcends the comic book genre and it's just a really good film that happens you have to book characters in,0.057938393
so yeah I used to confirm that what everybody's raving about them and everybody said this movie is amazing yes that's right,0.16954678
this movie is awesome,0.080542445
so let's begin and start talking about the softly things that i like but Logan not really the r-rating,0.105117865
thank you Dark Knight trilogy for existing and letting us have some best tweet comic book storylines with respect and take them serious and thank yous s fools for learning to use know that you can make an already comic book film and it can be good and it can be relatively successful,0.65599054
because without those two things we would not have had Logan,0.083288
and now we have Wolverine unleashed so we finally get to see what we actually kick some ass decapitating head dismembering people is adamantium claws or bloody and they are shots in people's,0.8010974
faces and it was glorious and awesome,0.070420496
the number two thing I liked about Logan is the moon this film is a very heavy dark slow him,0.2419895
it really reflects the way that Logan fields in this film,0.100610256
he's old tired and beaten emotionally and physically,0.4680923
it's not the usual light-hearted kind of film that you find in x-men franchise film it feels more like a Western or low-budget independent film then it does a big blockbuster comic book franchise film this one is very contained and very small then maybe like one exclusion in the whole thing and that's not bad thing,0.06408982
it's a very slowly paint film,0.10817207
but it was beautiful and there was space there for new arms and character development and emotional development fluid this film is kind of like the last of us and always darkness an awesome,0.0539047
this one also looks amazing it's shot really well i loved how logan looks and how old and beaten,0.5584742
he loved he has a big beard and his face is all my stuff,0.46256775
and he's all scarred Professor X also looks like,0.19329245
he has one foot in the grave to the sooner this dark gritty mood that I really enjoyed and it had this really nice serious tone throughout the song but it really fit well with the story in a china shop,0.12199277
the number one thing I liked about Logan was the performances Hugh Jackman attractive stewards bring out the big guns for this one but the steward plates an old and destroyed Professor Xavier he still has a little bit of hook and trying to do the best he can for the mutants,0.28255486
but at the same time you can tell that life has really taken poor on him,0.14738543
it's not the professor x that we are used to an adoring to us but it's also beautiful and engaging of course this film relies heavily on the performance of the young girl who plays a young mutant Laura played by Jack McKean and if she will be good in this film this one would have crashed and burned however this girl is perfect,0.24059923
this girl had two hits two things,0.31249666
she has to be engaging and not annoying and you got to like her and root for her and at the things like she had to be amazing an action sequences and she checked both boxes very well I loved watching her as X 23,0.092544384
she is monstrous which is fighting she's an animal and see what the film without even having to speak,0.5154597
she gives such an amazing performance was just looking at people and her team with hugh jackman is also just like a father's daughter master president thing happening,0.14137661
and it's the emotional core of the film but of course at the end of the day this is Hugh Jackman film this is Wolverine show and huge ointment put in his all in his performance of Wolverine,0.110658474
this is a very unique thing for me because I haven't watched a character to be played by the same actor for 17 years so to watch Hugh Jackman's grow from the younger green the receipt for the first time in the first x-men to this old man Logan it's just so amazing,0.08193414
it's captivating he plays Logan at the edge of his sanity the edge of his collar and he's just so tired,0.14891444
and you can tell that his heart has been ripped to shreds and it's on his face,0.33236268
it's in his eyes it's in the way he walks and talks new Jackman really excelled in missile,0.4225429
it's definitely his best performance,0.060988087
it's definitely for me that special Marie we've ever seen on screen I loved it as always no movie it's perfect,0.10525839
and now i'm going to talk about the story things that i personally didn't like about Logan numbers the exposition I just don't feel it the film handle exposition seen as well as i would have liked it to a very specific example of that is when cell phone footage is used to explain the background story of the young mutants and where she came from and a lot of movies do this where they show you footage on a cell phone or on a computer or on a USB and obviously edited to be a month ice cream,0.07230899
but it's filmed in a terrible way so it's in a cell phone that doesn't happen in real life,0.10274071
and what annoying is that there's a very easy solution to this kind of thing where you can just open the phone and show us the disc multiple footage is and videos and the character can go through them,0.15063435
and then the montage happens in the film itself then we as an audience can understand that this is part of the film not that it actually in the fourth edited and ready to be viewed as a ready-made montage delivered to your doorstep again,0.057761673
it's a nitpick,0.14432944
but when you happen in logan in an early cuz i self that the film was better you were better than that Logan movies you're burned it,0.26388198
the number two thing,0.050717555
i don't like about Logan was the character of cannabis not weekly,0.070139766
I didn't not like the character of Caliban the whole time I just hope that sometimes we spent a little bit too much time with them specially somewhere down in the middle of the film and it actually kind of slowed the film down,0.06258557
I would have rather stayed with Wolverine and with Professor X and with Laura rather than spend so much time on Caliban wasn't really that necessary,0.12525836
the number one thing,0.064573914
I didn't like about Logan is surprise surprise the villain,0.17190655
so the suppose it means villain in the film is the cycle Donald peers,0.14864524
he has he's like a full metal,0.25945574
alchemist thing going on I mean he was okay,0.14492317
and he pushes the plot forward,0.0523476
he leads the corporation,0.09268651
that's trying to hunt them down,0.37062266
I understand his presence from a plus point of view,0.15561841
but at the same time he didn't do much for me was very forgettable and also trying to stay away from spoilers here,0.08927691
but at the same time they had certain tools and characters that popped up that I found a little weird and didn't enjoy much the first time I saw the song the second time I saw the film that character and that weapon worked a little bit more for me,0.081467696
and I kind of warmed up to it but clearly he wasn't one of my favorite things,0.105695315
so it's the least favorite thing,0.08549016
i had about Logan,0.060757864
that's why I said number one,0.060983934
so all in all Logan is an incredibly directed written films and performed movie,0.082559384
I love it it exceeded my expectations,0.10387778
it was amazing,0.06680872
and it's the perfect send off to a beautiful character that I've been experiencing any loving for the last 17 years he's totally gonna be invisible to I'm calling it but a big giant salute to few judgment and his amazing run as this character I'm so happy but if Silver's happen and I'm so happy that it does not disappoint me,0.14853399
and for that reason I'm going to give logan and 9 out of 10,0.1586319
