own death in 2003 claimed to have actually been the trigger man that killed Hoffa,0.38000834
now this movie has been my most anticipated one of the year I love crime,0.15680636
drama centering on mob activity and as a lifelong fan of DeNiro Scorsese Pacino and,0.1535385
Pesci you could pretty much say this was my Avengers in game for 2019 and,0.24001995
had three and a half hours long I was not at all worried about the,0.06261369
runtime and after watching I can say that Scorsese does use every minute to tell,0.07424053
this story it could have honestly been longer and still not lost its appeal because,0.09889646
I think there are so many inner 20 dynamics in this era to cover its,0.055792116
a strong 70 style movie with a very atmospheric tone that does a good job,0.08716389
of luring the viewer in and with compelling characters played by world-class actors the result,0.080877185
to me is my pick for best film of the year as you would expect,0.08078092
from a Scorsese film it takes its time to develop the characters and the multiple,0.07361969
layers of the story the events covered in this one spans several decades there are,0.044989422
a lot of moving pieces that I thought each were able to bring their own,0.06414606
level of intrigue and appeal the various subplots do weave together nicely to create curiosity,0.10433226
and a foreboding tension of what's to come Jimmy how was a very charismatic figure,0.07882804
in his era I enjoyed how this plotline built the foundations to his Union dealings,0.091499895
his positions with the Teamsters as well as how all of that intertwined with the,0.10229372
political world as well as organized crime I mean Jimmy Hoffa had put himself in,0.24455994
the sights of many powerful figures and when and how that was going to manifest,0.03875371
itself was very interesting to see play out the script from Stevens ah Leon doesn't,0.06787608
spoon-feed the viewer exposition either it does kind of expect a certain level of historical,0.12209512
knowledge yet it is tightly informative when needed to keep that emotional connection locked in,0.09591641
while things are progressing the story is told from the perspective of Sheeran with a,0.032432437
flashback approach that I thought allowed for some effective narration from DeNiro many times while,0.08416089
watching a scene the commentary from DeNiro would come in to really add some dramatic,0.11028161
layering and many times some insight to what fueled the visuals being depicted on screen,0.07793436
the consistent time line with DeNiro recounting the events of the story also did create,0.052452207
a smooth flow from scene to scene as time periods would change and overall I,0.1009915
enjoyed it what was going on in the world around these focal characters was developed,0.08104677
nicely through the conversations and that is where I thought the phenomenal cast really came,0.057705082
into play nicely this film thrives on the performances from De Niro Pesci and Pacino,0.09850171
the result to me is a string of amazing scenes that were absolutely compelling and,0.07164891
nostalgic and just constantly entertaining I mean sitting back and watching these actors work off,0.16921827
one another just brought a smile to my face it's the timing between them that,0.06501199
was flawless and to me it just felt like there was a subtle enjoyment between,0.070339225
all of them but I thought translated extremely well on-screen as well as into these,0.09890315
characters but Chino was a very charismatic hapa with the larger-than-life personality that you would,0.1818162
want Pesci was subtly intense as a higher up in the Bufalino family and De,0.08799457
Niro in the lead was a layered character as a former soldier turned to mob,0.13008703
hitman and union leader they all were able to easily bring their spring presents to,0.24745561
the rolls but they were also able to disappear inside of these characters and that's,0.09598673
something that you really need when you have high-profile talent taking on the role of,0.17350522
real-life figures and the story couldn't possibly cover all the events that took place over,0.06420774
this years but I thought it did manage to do a good job of getting,0.08994006
the full spectrum of events inside there were some gaps in some information here and,0.044178616
there but there was still a strong continuity to it and admittedly reading up on,0.049526267
the real-life events will add some more depth to the backdrops of many of the,0.05578454
time periods while you're watching the talking point of this movie certainly is going to,0.10319569
be the de-aging of the cast that aspect of the post-production is what ballooned the,0.09195491
budget and caused many delays in this movie being released but the result was well,0.07928812
worth it in my opinion the various ages of the characters depicted was absolutely impressive,0.05060169
there were long stretches where I absolutely forgot about it which does speak a great,0.058901917
deal to what the technology was able to pull off with this movie there wasn't,0.062340222
just an age styling to the movie already one that kind of gives a strong,0.07186673
time period atmosphere to the film the color palette is slightly subdued which does allow,0.040058147
the de-aging to blend in nicely with the surroundings to give everything a nice seamless,0.08479549
solid look this movie really does take you on a historical journey filled with friendship,0.093243144
loyalty political intrigue and a lot of mob violence the characters are continually being explored,0.18368676
as are their relationships with one another and it all blends in together into a,0.062365495
great mob epoch the violence is very Scorsese asket comes out of nowhere hits with,0.19328189
impact but never does it feel forested as you would expect from Scorsese in this,0.09529941
genre it maintains a grounded realistic vibe complemented with dialogue that is just very intentional,0.077952094
imprinting with a lot of meaning it's very intense and climactic but never theatrical and,0.07152578
melodramatic the sense of humor splashes it nicely through the personality of the characters and,0.09378182
this one doesn't just tell a story it creates an immersive setting with everybody in,0.050942946
here bringing their a-game Joe Pesci is an incredible talents he's only done I think,0.15589386
like two movies since the 90s but I mean seeing him back in a role,0.13701835
of this type was very nostalgic it showed he still very much has what it,0.07270561
takes to create an imposing mob figure out Pacino still has that energy that adds,0.13196257
such a strong vibrant charisma to any role that he has in DeNiro was every,0.07781106
bit to leave this movie needed with a performance that I simply think is award,0.14296187
worthy for what this movie said to accomplish it absolutely succeeds and the Irishman from,0.07908744
me is going to get 100% on the entertainment meter I absolutely loved it it,0.09730789
could have been longer and still pulled more layers of this just fascinating era and,0.06017048
post-war American history yet as it was it was compelling from the opening scene up,0.1516958
until the end with the screen title I heard you paint houses closing everything out,0.029120702
I think the direction from Scorsese was polished it really left the performers capture the,0.033837263
mood and intensity with a visual appeal that really served as a complement to the,0.045232162
story not something that attempted to overshadow it and I couldn't recommend checking this movie,0.07637186
out more either in theaters if you can or when it hits Netflix now for,0.077261835
