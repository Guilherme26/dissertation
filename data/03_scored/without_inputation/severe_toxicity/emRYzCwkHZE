give a super thanks and thank you so much it is greatly appreciated rebecca was,0.01653447
released in 1940 directed by sir alfred hitchcock starring lawrence olivier and joan fontaine with,0.21244103
other notable performances by george sanders and judith anderson okay on to a quick synopsis,0.07011368
of the film it says a woman struggles with adjusting to her new role as,0.020959936
an aristocrat's wife and living up to the expectations of his first wife oh this,0.025372764
sounds like this is going to be fun i'm very excited to watch this so,0.05001649
at this point we are going to get into some historical background for those of,0.045478605
you who want to jump right onto the film reaction go for it but for,0.03748842
those of you who want to stay we're going to get right into it rebecca,0.071013674
was originally a novel written by daphne du maurier in 1938. de mourier was inspired,0.0069598164
by some of the events in charlotte bronte's jane eyre when writing her novel rebecca,0.032037906
after rebecca was published it was an instant hit in both england and in the,0.0857741
u.s there was a lot of excitement about making this novel into a picture k,0.053632427
brown and east coast story editor had recommended this novel to big time movie producer,0.028042812
david o selznick and it was also k brown who had recommended gone with the,0.23174727
win to him as well so her recommendations were pretty spot-on so selznick was impressed,0.085001156
with the novel and decided to buy the film rights for fifty thousand dollars which,0.006367803
in today's money would be worth just shy of one million dollars selznick also hired,0.07653271
on alfred hitchcock to direct the film after noticing his success streak in england during,0.11066594
the production of this film there were some creative differences between selznick and hitchcock selznick,0.1805661
really wanted to stick as closely to the book as possible and hitchcock wanted to,0.17393887
lighten some of the dark gothic themes of the story now selznick would eventually go,0.09803676
on to write hitchcock about his disdain of some of the substitutions that hitchcock added,0.33864224
saying quote we bought rebecca and we intend to make rebecca end quote now despite,0.0240557
these differences rebecca was received very well with the audiences and it actually went on,0.01776772
to be nominated for 11 oscars at the 13th annual academy awards and it won,0.014428498
two including best picture okay on to some interesting facts now before this movie's release,0.030837914
selznick allowed orson welles to release a radio version of rebecca and unsurprisingly it was,0.10786019
a huge hit because as we know everything that orson welles touches turns to gold,0.06562769
so this was meant to draw up a lot of publicity for the film version,0.024259247
and once the radio version was released to the public everyone was super excited to,0.037401944
watch the film version of rebecca filming for rebecca started on september 8th 1939 which,0.01940141
was just less than a week after the uk entered world war ii now this,0.20381227
became slightly problematic because a lot of the members of the cast were british so,0.12327982
80 years later in october of 2020 netflix released a remake of rebecca starring lily,0.01821805
james and armie hammer and then finally this is the first criterion collection film that,0.024035081
we are watching where i actually bought the physical copy of the film i was,0.01964753
so impressed with just the amount of care that they put into making just the,0.054144617
packaging of this and if you compare it to like say you know the good,0.08211625
the bad and the ugly this feels really plastic like it's just a case to,0.12844364
hold a dvd but this one is like really well packaged by the way this,0.052275453
video was not sponsored i literally just wanted to share that with you because i,0.09536738
was just blown away by the packaging um now with all that being said i,0.07260746

a teeny weeny bit forward with mr winter your effort to enter the conversation quite,0.06315586
embarrassed me and i'm sure it did him her forwardness she didn't even say anything,0.19870432
to him she looked like she was so scared to talk to this de winters,0.120884486
guy i was able to have lunch with me okay i'm here for her i,0.098406605

like like doctored in any way i don't know if that makes sense but it,0.089202456
feels like a very natural very natural conversation between two people i'm really liking the,0.058037937
dialogue so far it's just a place where i was born i've lived in all,0.066006176
my life now i don't suppose i could ever see it again as soon as,0.047802757
he started talking about his home manderly his whole entire demeanor changed he went from,0.08019986

those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping altitude she's all like,0.1467322
i want to remember this moment forever and he's like well you don't want to,0.06589575

have to hand it to you for a fast workout how did you manage it,0.062097553
i love the use of the pannins in this film i wonder if that is,0.039507918
like a trademark of hitchcock that was then used later on to show suspense i,0.24250503
don't know you better leave mrs van harper you'll miss your train mrs dewinter goodbye,0.09180067
maddie and i'm telling you as much as we all want to fall in love,0.22841822

makes your heart melt but there's something else to him and i just i don't,0.031361412
completely trust him and why did he want to get married to her so quickly,0.052705824
you know just questions you gotta start asking yourself the the questions of like you've,0.052954603
only known each other for a couple of days why do you want to get,0.022261037
married to her so quickly um something's not completely right there's nobody that's mandating oh,0.061498888

cottage manor manor i don't know my house jargon okay i have everything in readiness,0.051026903
for you that's very good of you oh i didn't express this danvers she gave,0.11477012

my nerves bad mrs danvers i i do hope we beat friends i hope i,0.5111761
should do everything to your satisfaction madam i've managed the house since mrs dewinter's death,0.39164442
and mr winter has never complained her eyes say so much like she says things,0.083439305
you can tell she is a woman who's very dedicated to her work but her,0.08525526
eyes tell a very different story she is like looking at this new bride all,0.028374074
up and down like you think you belong here but you don't belong here like,0.19579548
you just see it in her eyes that room in the west wing i was,0.06985958
telling you about is there through that door the only one that looks down across,0.019289661
the lawns to the sea it was mr winters i knew it i knew it,0.03375674
was mrs dewinter's room there'd be no other reason to board it up oh and,0.029033937
there's like a dog that just sits right in front of it oh i wonder,0.10806573
if they decided to use a black dog or like a darkly coated dog be,0.07611364
to kind of signify like an omen of some sort i don't know could be,0.13419083
me i love the the music in this i think the music really does set,0.024614455
the tone between scenes also because it's like the music starts to change a little,0.023586081
bit like it was like light-hearted and fun and now it's still light-hearted but there's,0.048709404
like little notes of of something a little bit darker in the music she's like,0.11373643
still totally in love with him have a look at the times there's a thrilling,0.057371423
article on what's the matter with english cricket oh my god laura it's olivier i,0.15038139
could not act with this man i would actually in real life fall in love,0.19667019
with him my sister beatrice and her husband giles lacey have invited themselves over for,0.33546102
lunch today already he's literally leaving her to deal with his sister and her hus,0.098066695
and her and her husband his sister and his sister's husband that's weird to say,0.12105344
there's that dog again yeah that i wonder if that dog is always like that,0.06818665
dog is always there whenever it's a room that the that rebecca would frequent so,0.028098023
yeah i wonder if this is like her study or something i don't know oh,0.04555244
i'm afraid you've made a mistake mrs dewind has been dead for over a year,0.24674357
oh i mean she's like i'm she's like when it's like mrs winter she's so,0.08838428
out of her depth it's almost like she's expected to live up to this sort,0.07700831
of idea this role that i don't think that she's ready for at all she,0.11420205
had some pretty high profile friends oh no i like that phone call that she,0.045714747
received and she's like oh i'm sorry mrs dewitt has been dead for over a,0.27831605
year and then she hangs it up and she's like wait but i'm mrs dewinter,0.11635991
shall we sit down you see she's bound to be insanely jealous at first and,0.2944358
she must resent you bitterly why why should she she simply adored rebecca so that's,0.11069121
why she's all dark inside cause she's like your tail like i said she's like,0.6071256
you're taking a place that is not yours like oh no that could spell trouble,0.043999903
my dear you fond of dancing well i love it but i'm not very good,0.1419748
at it so but i'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do,0.09428579
she sketches a little he doesn't even know what his wife does because they only,0.15733922
know each other for like two days he doesn't even know her what don't sail,0.049452413
do you no i don't thank goodness for that oh so he wasn't supposed to,0.026524862
mention sailing oh no what does that mean why don't you do something about your,0.060457878
hair no it looks perfect i can see by the way you dress you don't,0.06283591
care who how you look wow he must have changed a lot then wow the,0.023686524
sister is really forward i'm here for it you know the whole story no she,0.02982617
doesn't i don't even think i know the whole story now we can have a,0.012633833
walk about the place runner get a coat from the flower room for mr winter,0.032109078
will you just hearing her being called mrs dewinter doesn't even sound like right because,0.1128983
i feel like this whole film we have been conditioned to think of rebecca as,0.021665031
mrs dewinter and like this woman as his new wife you know where does that,0.2423379
lead to oh it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a,0.02948094
boat oh let's go down there all right we'll walk down and take a look,0.1013241
if you really want to oh my god i love this i love the romance,0.05353265
of it but i just feel like it's too good to be true he's heard,0.043879505
himself no he's all right leave me alone don't you think i better go and,0.054359473
see don't bother about him i'll tell you he can't come to anyone he'll find,0.082771465
his own way back something happened there there's no way there's no way he's reacting,0.03228136
like that because there's something happened there oh and it opened by itself don't go,0.038118348
in there i know that dog he comes for the elf ew he's mr de,0.09783787
winter's dog you're mrs dewinter oh that's weird i didn't like the way he looked,0.13227908
at her rebecca dewinda oh my goodness she had some affiliation with that cottage know,0.06433989
i didn't want you to go there but you deliberately went oh because i hate,0.14747255
the place and if you had my memories you wouldn't go there or talk about,0.074167974
it read and think about it you should never have come back to mandarin he,0.067601286
knows there's something that happened that something that he is not telling her secrets skeletons,0.07239659
in the closet are those all rebecca's things down there yes she was washed overboard,0.0715884
wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone she wasn't afraid of anything everyone,0.109074816
knows something that this woman whose name has still not been mentioned okay this woman,0.14304641
and the audience don't know they know something because they're all super secretive and super,0.044300567
shady i don't know i don't know what's going on they're all comparing me with,0.07961184
him yep with rebecca you have qualities that are justified really big shoes so throughout,0.026625305
this film there you really do get the sense that she is being compared to,0.05563729
this glorious rebecca de winter but then also there are people who are like yeah,0.08022181
you're really sweet like they're like comparing her but then also reassuring her that she's,0.07101767
like good or in a good position and it just feels really strange i don't,0.0360024
know why tell me what was rebecca really like i suppose she was the most,0.0313674
beautiful creature i ever saw oh well that makes you feel good huh literally just,0.09647025
negated everything he said to her to reassure her oh she's trying you think there's,0.05148987
something's right for you doesn't seem your type at all she loves him so desperate,0.07404159
like i don't think that he loves her the way that she loves him and,0.05565126
the tragedy is that like he's trying to fill these shoes of this woman who,0.13314316
i'm not even really sure existed at this point okay because we still have not,0.03886402
seen her and it's just sad it's like don't compare yourself to someone who you'll,0.08514151
never be you know it appears that mrs danvers has accused robert of stealing a,0.072244264
valuable ornament from the morning room what was the thing anyway china cupid sir oh,0.15444833
yeah that's one of our treasures isn't it it was it was the thing that,0.020116484
she broke that is all i broke the china cupid you broke it is it,0.24820273
possible to repair the ornament madam smashed into pieces she looks man look at fruit,0.25276515
fritz was even scared for a second he was looking like oh no what's going,0.040924758
to go down she kept her composure but her eyes were like this he says,0.24526177
dan must must be furious with me oh hang this down oh she should you,0.41053224
be frightened of it cause she's scary abstract is made or something i do love,0.13616376
how she how danvers really keeps her composure the whole time because you don't know,0.09867334
what she's thinking i mean you can see it in her eyes right but like,0.06678377
she's so calm about it and it just it intensifies things i suppose that's why,0.06575407
you married me never be any gossip about me got it whoa whoa the lighting's,0.11327811
on his face i also like how he really kept the audience in the dark,0.046917398
here like in this film we're really as much in the dark as you know,0.08386369
this woman who is this new mrs dewinters i've gone up to london on some,0.3058602
business of the estate i shall return before evening and certainly this brief holiday from,0.022638861
me should be welcome maxim she's like in despair she's like where's my maxim i'm,0.1371582
sure she does not like that house or the people living in it looking for,0.09352682
me left his little bride all alone this is mr favel madam i am rebecca's,0.115539074
favorite cousin who one of rebecca's family members oh my god i don't know what,0.03713055

lost don't go in there girl don't do it i know you want to it's,0.11501225
on your face oh she's about to go in and of course the room is,0.08376724
big she looks so small in this big space and it's like symbolic of her,0.21111798
like not being able to fill these shoes of mrs dewinter that's really i see,0.061246783
what you did there hitchcock i see what you did there it's a picture of,0.16657263
maxim kind of tells us that she really loved him i love how we get,0.06431328
the characterization of rebecca she really is a main character in this film yet she's,0.048631575
never physically seen so that's really cool that we kind of get that in this,0.0255364
this is where i keep all her clothes feels like this is weird they were,0.2049391
made especially for her by the nuns and the convent of sinclair oh wow how,0.24003349
glorious that her her uh like her drawers like open like kind of like a,0.23566607
lazy susan almost where it like opens up and it's just like it's just so,0.105942465
glorious wow i always used to wait up for her no matter how late sometimes,0.07872648
she and mr winter didn't come home until dawn very much admired her just hearing,0.033997536
of the greatness of rebecca how everyone loved her all these things it's furthering this,0.038016576
poor woman's idea of herself like i'm never going to be this i could never,0.17268899
be this for max for manderley like i'm not this woman like it's this is,0.22018044
a lot poor girl did you ever see anything so delicate it is delicate wow,0.12783699
like she looks visibly uncomfortable about this entire situation like it's kind of making me,0.07199881
uncomfortable a little bit i'm like i feel that secondhand like discomfort do you think,0.117015116
the dead come back and watch the living i don't believe it i wonder if,0.10282076
she doesn't come back here demandedly watch you and mr winter together you know that's,0.041960448
probably not something that she wants to hear it's probably not something she wants to,0.0405762
hear she's constantly surrounded by ideas and thoughts of rebecca it's like haunting her i,0.10797128
am sister winter now mrs danvers gotta watch out for her thanks maximum could we,0.104272194
have a costume ball i feel that we ought to do something to to make,0.063984014
people feel that mendel is just the same as it always was instead of cowering,0.029180275
and like running away and being afraid she stood her ground and she's like no,0.06967865
i am the new mrs de winter and she like stood her ground okay honey,0.074605
i see you boo you might find a costume among the family portraits that would,0.112702064
suit you oh you mean those at the top of the stairs i'll go and,0.039446056
look at them she is staging a war oh my goodness i've heard mr winter,0.076696336
say that this is his favorite of all the paintings oh well well well that's,0.018839996
a splendid idea mrs danvers i'm i'm very grateful um i don't trust her i,0.1918343
don't trust her at all um i wonder if that's rebecca and that costume is,0.055173658
going to get a rise out of the winter oh my god i think that's,0.06857312
what's going to happen you were the first one down yes where's the child well,0.112034224
she's keeping a costume for every single show oh lovely oh please don't come in,0.15241553
beatrice i don't want anyone to see my costume every single aspect of this film,0.18666716
has some sort of like suspenseful leading on the audience what's gonna happen next how's,0.05264463
everyone gonna react like he truly is the master of suspense i just i'm scared,0.13946374
i know something is off good evening mr de winter oh my god what did,0.05255749
i say what did i say dan vs staging a war oh i watched you,0.11070784
go down just as i watched her a year ago even in the same dress,0.20705703
you couldn't compare you knew it you never trust your enemy dude mmm that naivety,0.265538
got her this time am i done do you think you should never hate me,0.122011974
so you're trying to take her i knew it i've seen his face he doesn't,0.06994606
love you he wants to be alone again with her you have nothing to live,0.12779042
for really have you she is just tearing her down emotionally and mentally oh this,0.1970407
scene is so powerful and we feel with this woman everything you are strong you,0.09132706
can do this fight here i'm talking as if she could listen she can't hear,0.08902286
me she's like you could never compare to her like what are you even doing,0.18070844
like just tearing her down that was that was and but here's the thing she,0.085201375
did it keeping her composure very sinister stuff i knew where rebecca's body was because,0.13434182
i put it there what wait a second did he just confess to murder did,0.360965
he did he murder rebecca wait a second wait a second wait a second what,0.28104162
is going on oh my god how could we be close when i knew you,0.05861931
were always thinking of rebecca you thought i loved rebecca i hated it oh my,0.14530604
god that changes everything this whole time i'm thinking to myself he just loved her,0.054441955
so much and he's grieving her death but no he just literally said he hated,0.37490132
her i want to hear his story okay i was told i was the luckiest,0.033905074
man in the world but i never had a moment's happiness with her she was,0.14979602
incapable of love she stood there laughing and told me all about herself oh my,0.1037314
god so what did rebecca do i want like an origin story of rebecca now,0.04231499
i i need to know more about her so i'll play the part of a,0.033998866
devoted wife mistress of your precious mandalay i'll make it the most famous show place,0.12496539
in england if you like i kept the bargain and so did she apparently oh,0.045096125
she played the game brilliantly so it's like we're really getting a full character analysis,0.020759052
or a full character development of someone who we don't actually ever see i think,0.022117356
that is fantastic then there was a cousin of hers a man named favel yes,0.07736285
i know him why didn't you tell me i thought it would remind you of,0.03796602
rebecca so i wonder if he really did marry this woman because he really actually,0.1300414
found love with her literally this plot twist just changed the entire perspective of the,0.045065526
film oh my god when i found that she'd come back quietly from london i,0.058618642
thought that favela was with her and i knew then that i couldn't stand this,0.07972359
life of filth and deceit any longer okay so favel is not rebecca's cousin i,0.5292245
think favelas might be her lover at least that's what it sounds like that is,0.04730919
so twisted a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her suddenly she got up started,0.11646168
to walk toward me oh my god and they're using the camera angles to literally,0.050942425
show us her movements they're lit they're literally characterizing a person who doesn't actually exist,0.15687026
in terms of like like physically like she isn't physically there and yet they're making,0.040493056
her be there that is so strange i must have stuck almost triumphant she stumbled,0.17282136
and fell it's almost like she wanted him to kill her like to say i,0.76247466
got you even in death oh my gosh i remember wondering why she was still,0.38447967
smiling and i realized she was dead but you didn't kill me she fell it,0.36470464
was an accident who would believe me yeah yeah and and who would believe him,0.21849088
because she's she's literally shown herself as like the devoted perfect wife nobody knows about,0.21237718
her like secret life except for him so no one would believe him they're writing,0.07914089
if they find out it was rebecca you must simply say that you made a,0.022100061
mistake about the other body she can't harm you anymore we're the only two that's,0.09563811
not true no maxim you and i she literally has not been shown this entire,0.12062972
film and still somehow she is still the strongest character in this film there's nothing,0.031785134
you can do she won i loved you my darling he really did love her,0.074881054
no no she hasn't won no matter what happens now she hasn't won bro she,0.05188366
totally won like i'm just so blown away at the fact that she literally has,0.07250302
not even been physically shown yet she holds more pow the freaking movie is named,0.39356825
after her okay this is this is rebecca's movie she is the shining star of,0.03651991
the film and we don't even see her i am floored i don't mind this,0.043654006
whole thing except for you he loves her oh we still have this strong romance,0.06283857
that we can still root for you know that we're like okay he truly loves,0.037798397
her he truly wants to be with her which i like i don't know nothing,0.20402513
i don't want to go to the asylum clearly he didn't see anything okay move,0.054815788
on anyway i feel bad that i misjudged him in the beginning he was a,0.11891422
little creepy i'm not gonna lie but you know what he truly was just kind,0.12418912
of like a a bystander mr winter please i have to ask you a very,0.07797881
personal question where relations between you and the late mr winter perfectly happy she looks,0.04828169
like she's literally about to blow and say something and screw everything up she just,0.43919158
needs to chill out i won't stand this any longer and you might as well,0.09952477
know now will adjourn to oh lunch mr winter i presume you'll be available for,0.026436394
us then oh my god this is so intense darling wait here a few moments,0.04173695
i'll see if i can find old frank and how does the bride find herself,0.06207028
today you know you've grown up a bit since i lost this oil what do,0.05592598
you want for them you can also kind of see that in the the wardrobe,0.04615709
or the costuming choices that they've used throughout the film she looks like she really,0.017974593
has grown up like this really has taken the innocence right out of her i,0.13578926
find myself in a rather awkward position it's from rebecca and what's more she had,0.054780535
the foresight to put the date on it but i can assure you that it,0.025701366
is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night,0.3309907
i'm not gonna lie i kind of like favel's character like he's like he's sly,0.17904283
but he does it very like charismatically he's like i know what's going on you,0.04855774
know like i don't know i really like his character even though i feel like,0.03904229
he's a bad guy he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the,0.1284882
inquest if i made it worth his while just seen the doctor and i'm going,0.040532965
down to mandalay right away i have something terribly important to tell you rebecca i,0.12067229
thought the letter was going to be something like like more in-depth like you know,0.021545298
starting a new life hey maybe this kid might be yours i still don't know,0.10521542
if that's her cousin ah here she is the missing link apply the motives i,0.07002521
believe you'll know everyone else and we know that she is like in total admiration,0.027103573
of rebecca so she's oh something's gonna go down i feel it who was rebecca's,0.08296437
doctor i don't know anything about it oh don't give me that danny you knew,0.03505651
everything about rebecca you knew she was in love with me didn't you love was,0.04853313
a game to her only a game it made her laugh i tell you i,0.08592975
knew that i knew that she admired that dark side of rebecca i knew it,0.045301
it has been suggested mrs dewinter was deliberately murdered the name of the murderer it's,0.36024064
a lovely name george fortescue maximilian de winter look at her face the first time,0.13738637
she's shown emotion on her face we don't want reminiscences danny what was his name,0.15169978
dr baker 165 goldhawk road shepherd's bush there you are colonel there's where you'll find,0.04030015
your motive he is just a little freaking rat that is the first time i'd,0.5819725
ever seen emotion on her face i've never attended a mrs winter in my life,0.17052248
the lady must have used an assumed name the woman was very seriously ill what,0.07142942
was wrong with her cancer that would have given her motive to want to take,0.26580092
her life literally this plan the favela had literally backfired on him that's what you,0.20987342
get for being a douchebag there was nothing that could be done for her except,0.63573587
wait she smiled in a queer sort of way when i told her it was,0.23720135
a matter of months she said oh no doctor not that long she knew she,0.046739127
was gonna die and she had pla like she planned this she planned this cunning,0.56098247
woman please just let them live in peace danvers please they've been through so much,0.19587064
oh my god she's gonna set up she's gonna set a fire she's gonna set,0.19440258
a fire i can i can see it she has the candle she has the,0.15036343
crazy eyes oh my god she's gonna commit arson just dry it it's that's not,0.22101392
the northern lights that's mandalay she's totally dead there's no way that she's like that,0.21224813
oh she made it out oh jesus thank you thank you thank you that she,0.10135935
made it out i was literally freaking out she she's in there she looks crazy,0.31739005
that final scene with vr oh what a film that was fantastic that had me,0.05069032
on the edge of my seat from beginning to end like all of the twists,0.06902478
and at the end it just kept coming just new information just pow pow pow,0.043982606
right at us i mean that was fantastic i think that was so good you,0.06487935
never saw rebecca and yet she was such a prevalent figure in this film so,0.03561194
the fact that they were able to make this character so real and so like,0.01544623
visceral without actually having her physically there is astounding it was fantastic and then the,0.13113098
plot twists where like we got to see a different side of rebecca not this,0.01577084
brilliant beautiful cunning woman but this like sadistic sinister monster even though mr dewinter maxim,0.6003969
didn't tell us what she had said to him after those four days of marriage,0.030094238
we still got the sense that it was something that was a lot darker than,0.020156395
you know what she was letting on on the surface i definitely have to give,0.03662235
