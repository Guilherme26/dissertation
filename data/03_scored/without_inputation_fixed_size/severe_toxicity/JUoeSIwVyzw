hello and welcome back to screen fanatic I am knowledge and today we'll be reviewing,0.07478194
the classic movie The Godfather first let me say this this movie for its time,0.058542814
is I think it was it was it was advanced it was it was ahead,0.02278121
of allowing the other films around that time as far as filmmaking screenwriting and even,0.030201998
producing this movie was just it had a lot of hidden gems all throughout the,0.044421628
entire movie now the movie is four hours long so it's a ton of it's,0.036688868
a ton of just scenes in lines in the movie that just you can apply,0.033426143
to your your everyday life as far as it's your own life even if you,0.43245786
have a family you know you have a wife you have children now to say,0.07291078
you're doing something illegal but I mean it's just it was it was very meaningful,0.052012704
the entire movie the weight of the screen was the way that the sprint was,0.023627322
written and just everything about the film so I'm gonna start from the beginning with,0.017355971
this film because it it was a lot of it was just a lot of,0.041737612
things that I had to kind of had to absorb and take in and I,0.031688683
wanted to make sure that I got it right and doing this film review because,0.026834173
this is a very classic movie that I still love watching today and it's just,0.04121212
it's very meaningful so from the beginning um basically the director is Francis Ford Coppola,0.024494058
who's a great director and he's best known for his three Godfather films part the,0.016740011
first part part two and as well as part three and then you also have,0.013880387
the screenwriter which is Mario Puzo or I don't know if I'm saying his name,0.045804545
correctly excuse me if I'm butchered his name but I believe is Mario Puzo or,0.1065418
puzzle in Mario Puzo he does this was some of his best work like I,0.03127494
I look to my research to see what kind of work that he did on,0.034030795
other films and he out of two other films song summer comedy but this is,0.043955334
one of the most I think this is some of his most prized work kind,0.10308085
of like an artifact you know but I mean it was great and then you,0.05993105
had a star-studded cast you had Marlon Brando who played Vito Corleone II The Godfather,0.03827533
did done you had a you had al pacino who played Michael Curley only the,0.042893037
son James can he plays Santino Corleone II Sonny you have Robert Duvall who plays,0.031086693
Tom Hagen which is the adopted son the lawyer of the family you had a,0.04781473
Talia Shire I don't know if I'm pronouncing her name right - excuse me but,0.05581157
as she plays the the sister and but she you know if you can remember,0.0200646
correctly she was also in the the series or the sequence of films with what,0.03024457
Sylvester Stallone the rocky she played Adrian Adrian so anyways but this is this is,0.035709053
a great film right off the get-go a scene that's very memorable for me was,0.03772323
where were they having a sit-down and one of the guys come to they arranged,0.12151575
the meeting and one of the guys he comes to thee what comes to the,0.022767905
meeting with a proposition for the done for Vito to start selling you know start,0.032950535
selling drugs so you know he has a lot of very he has a lot,0.08474373
of incentives for the Corleone family and he wants Vito to come in because Vito,0.039885078
has a lot of politicians in his pocket and all the other five families are,0.015393015
basically on board they're ready they're backing you know they're just waiting for Vito cause,0.05446723
Vito out all at this time out of all the five families they all are,0.053765465
strong they have a lot of stripper Beto is like the glue Beto is like,0.17752089
the originator he's like the beginning like he's like one of the first ones to,0.041847367
really come to power within his family and to really take this done La Cosa,0.03901302
Nostra la famiglia to the next level but he's old school and that's why he's,0.11688807
been able to survive so long because he makes move and he's a he's a,0.045165304
he's very deep and thinking so they cut off so all the other families are,0.23092057
already on board they come to Vito Vito beat always the pros and the cons,0.16882028
and he basically says the science against it and I think he decides against them,0.03157361
he knows right away I gotta bring in something I gotta I got to I,0.05565126
have to alert some of my muscle to keep an eye on this fellow because,0.049006075
he's not the type to take know the right way correctly he's the type to,0.058702458
want to get together with the other families in and to oppose me and try,0.08271692
to take me out you know so basically that's what he does he brings in,0.087779626
Luca Brasi and he tells Luca Brasi to kind of be like a spider going,0.016134694
they're kind of spiky piling this guy Tony you're not happy with the family you,0.04898612
know you're not happy what we're doing over here and to invest the report back,0.017858185
to me so Luca Brasi does this and he says you know I'm not happy,0.032301985
maybe you guys make me an offer here and to give a more in depth,0.039593726
perception of Luca Brasi is a very big guy very muscular known for just best,0.01455954
but he comes in when he needs to take when they need him to take,0.033232573
care of any problem that is physical I mean he's a very intimidating looking individual,0.09265809
very physically imposing but the the opposition kana is able to kind of fill this,0.0808105
out and they kind of plot a setup a plot against it to where it,0.045256436
was no mass for three to four individuals that take him out you know he,0.03964295
tried to put up a fight but they're able to take him out so actually,0.09023083
I want to go back to a scene prior to that happening before this meeting,0.0892284
is adjourned between between Vito and his and his family in the salaat see died,0.18308182
his son Santino aka Sonny before he tells him what when he when he insists,0.08384174
no Sonny steps up and says wait wait a minute you can't you guarantee you,0.030400889
know what he's basically hashing over the benefits in his head and Vito kind of,0.11951887
like tells him Sonny you know kind of like makes him back up a little,0.06710173
bit and he says and he tells slot-c says you have to excuse my children,0.17910935
let me try to do it in his voice you have to excuse my children,0.2140674
I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them as you can,0.08043401
see they talk when they should be listening but that was a very great scene,0.02501689
is you know eventually basically what he was saying is you know he's compassionate for,0.018689664
his children he has a weakness for them and in a sense they are spoiled,0.15504898
but you know you're dealing with me so but that kind of gave slot-c a,0.058186274
little a little traction a little bit like Sonny was half of my deal you,0.20261028
know so as you can see the wheels are already put in motion as far,0.008966676
as all right well Vito assists no and then the thing with Luca Brasi happens,0.024822658
and they take Luca Brasi out so I really don't want to go into the,0.03415851
movie but this is a very very clever movie it's very thoughtful it makes you,0.039378207
think it makes you a pile a lot of the scenes to your own life,0.24934992
and how you will move as far as how you would deal with people is,0.032297328
very this every a lot of the scenes are about power as far as how,0.022932872
you leverage it in your own way and to come on come out on top,0.10650056
I mean I can go on and on I mean as far as the characters,0.048642218
you have Santino you have Luca Brasi you have Clemenza you have Tom Hagen you,0.091251224
have Tesio you have Fredo which is the brother and this film was very good,0.035066485
because it focuses on character development and as I've said in my other reviews that,0.01262319
anytime the film the producers and the screenwriters take the time to really focus on,0.015714299
character development from the beginning and how they come into play later in the film,0.024847936
and all throughout the film makes a huge difference nine times out of ten they,0.014928716
always make for great films so I mean like I said I want to I,0.06771237
don't want to cut this films I don't want to cut this review short but,0.08032425
I want to keep it going because this is such a classic film that I,0.06445031
don't mind going about over my normal time period as far as my reviews because,0.035564043
this I this is I owe it to this film so no after you have,0.064407736
after you have Luca Brasi taken all the Godfather is eventually gunned down but he,0.13934599
ends up surviving now in the myths in the midst of that taking place know,0.015837358
Selassie comes to Tom Hagen and tells them all right well we know Sonny is,0.07516109
up next he's he's immediately acting Godfather so I want you to go to Sonny,0.09787512
and I want you to convince some hey we don't want war but convince him,0.0533617
to go along the plan as as I would like to do so so he,0.033381578
says okay I will talk to him but you know Sonny he's very hot-headed he's,0.35470244
very emotional but let me see what I can do and they know this so,0.016916286
he says I'll see what I can do but even Sonny won't be able to,0.040797707
call off Luca Brasi now so Selassie is kind of a thinker and he tries,0.07454912
to he's a chess player he likes to move steps ahead so with them knowing,0.027935052
this he says well you let me worry about Luca Brasi and at the time,0.023229543
Tom Hagen is not aware of this he's not aware of this at all oh,0.058021307
excuse me for saying somebody's busted my line okay so yeah so Tom Hagen isn't,0.06879994
aware of this at the moment so as their as their little rendezvous is adjourned,0.064611286
one of his one of Selassie gods pulls over since hey he lets him know,0.04019971
he's alive he survived two men you know i temped on his life he survived,0.3193279
so now this kind of ruins his plans he's upset by this news and he,0.040189732
says Tom we hit him with five shots and he's still alive and he says,0.3699743
this is gonna be bad news for me and it's gonna be bad news for,0.066542976
you if you don't get Sonny to make that deal so this kind of offsets,0.04459857
a lot of the timing and a lot of the plans that were supposed to,0.0077447332
take place so after this this is this is a very key moment in the,0.016149994
film because it's like what's gonna happen this you know the Kirlian currently only family,0.087731734
member The Godfather he survived but he's gonna be gone for a while cuz he's,0.07614956
an older guy we gotta figure out what's going on we gotta still run we,0.025199817
gotta run off the family's business and affairs all in once so within this time,0.046969946
period you have you have Michael currently only he starts to get involved in the,0.033644322
family business now to kind of take a few back steps Michael currently owned it,0.033798646
from the beginning didn't want anything to do with the family business he was very,0.010208573
he was he was adamant about that you know in fact he ended up joining,0.034078024
the Marines or yeah end up joining Marines to kind of get away from the,0.05871842
family business which his family didn't agree with because his father had it set up,0.021082995
for him to go to college at Furman to be more into you know governing,0.094249874
govern government politics politics type of thing maybe like a you know a senator or,0.050683666
a councilman a mayor or governor something to that extent but of course Michael had,0.019786553
other plans and you know he he stood strong on it but when his father,0.034765158
gets harmed he find the ins up he is a finding out through his girlfriend,0.07653603
at the time which is Kate and while they're out in fact how they're finding,0.018792769
out while they're out doing Christmas shopping she just happens to take a glimpse at,0.07194227
the newspaper and season you know be toker Leone feared be being killed by by,0.1554155
gunfire but it doesn't say whether he's dead or not so she says Michael she's,0.1636385
trying to get his attention and she shows him the paper and immediately Michael starts,0.06661083
to panic and he's very like you know distress he needs to figure out what's,0.07481653
going on with his father he stops by a payphone makes a phone call hey,0.02671577
Sonny what's going on you know is I see that pop has been shot is,0.12050533
he in a hospital doesn't say whether he's dead or not and they said yeah,0.1376511
the old man is in the hospital but we don't know you know he looked,0.0712252
like he may pull through but it's very you know very he's very critical at,0.03251484
this moment so immediately my co-stars to a sin he starts to step into the,0.07239327
family business giving advice no dude let's try to do this let's do that and,0.0182553
at first they're kind of like kind of like waving them off Jesus love young,0.047262628
brother he doesn't really know nothing about family it's the family business and politics as,0.024486076
far as the affairs and how we move and do things just you know we're,0.018696317
gonna protect them he's our younger brother but kind of stay out of it you,0.10039284
know that's how they kind of treat Michael but Michael is actually giving very sound,0.020044643
advice so before that scene actually happens going back to the beginning because there's a,0.017887453
lot of things that come into place later in the movie but going back to,0.029707102
the beginning of the movie when Michael's is all decked out in his medals and,0.05514439
Marine uniform he counted he's telling Kay his girlfriend about a little bit about the,0.046820283
family business because she was inquiring about Luca Brasi like I said Luca Brasi is,0.018632459
very intimidating very physically opposing us his look he kind of gives her a little,0.097222574
brief description on it and going into the family business and he tells Kate it's,0.019534448
my family kids not me you know so fast for moving forward so now that,0.111374356
this is taking place Michael is he's really he really wants in now he really,0.032634575
wants to go forward and and really do all he can to help so upon,0.04690875
doing this you know he he starts to really get involved in a sin and,0.064413056
go higher and higher and this is kind of like where the the film kind,0.027950352
of transcends they they their producers did a great job of shooting Michael to kind,0.26401496
of show like wow does give great advice and but a kind from this from,0.0168797
that point on as his father is healing it they're producing they kind of zoom,0.024457471
in on Mike to kind of show like all right from this point on were,0.033684235
kind of moving and to be into the Michael Corleone II stage of the film,0.014556213
now that kind of showed that you know he's accumulating his power and he's really,0.02414284
just it's really and he's a natural addict at being a godfather and being a,0.100930974
nun and Michael starts to really step up and take over so I'll stop right,0.08606545
there without going in any further because this is it's like it's a very long,0.040156472
film but it's very it's it's great it's not slow at any point you won't,0.02846986
miss you you'll be on a it's very gripping you'll be on the answer you,0.04549856
see watching it and you can watch this film over and over again but this,0.050532673
is a great film four stars like give this look film a four star rating,0.014105219
this is like I said I love watching the zoom and I kind of love,0.04137642
love watching it around family you know sometimes well for the most part my family,0.03316872
does it they don't completely understand it like I do and break it down like,0.07613559
I do but that's why I'm here to do the review so but this is,0.022054164
a great film four star rating I love a lot of the scenes the the,0.013332276
discussions the side discussions that a lot of individuals are having in the scenes the,0.036705498
roundtables where it's like a panel discussion where they're working out differences I mean this,0.052592743
is a great film from top to bottom I love the way it was put,0.03308424
together I would like to see it redone in a modern version but I don't,0.05198477
want it to take away from the original version but it has to be has,0.03048204
redone and a modern version it has to be great a as far as acting,0.07159704
screen writing producing directing it has to be up to par it cannot say oh,0.04092875
man they should have just never remained it you know but if that's the case,0.056502696
then don't remake it because this such a great film I mean I love our,0.024604477
Pacino I mean every all the characters were you know you could see how they,0.02907052
all come into play this was an outstanding film for from producing to directing to,0.016910298
oscar-worthy performances from the actors from a lot of this the screen shots with the,0.08810291
way they were able to capture different moments in the film how the by them,0.022754602
doing so it kind of focuses all more so on the actual scene or the,0.017885458
purpose of the character versus them giving a dot a specific type of dialogue but,0.01861982
don't get me wrong the dialogue was also great too so if you liked this,0.024148827
