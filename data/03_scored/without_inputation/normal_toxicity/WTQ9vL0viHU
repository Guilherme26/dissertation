and some of the praise that the movie was getting so really that's all I had to go with going into the film um,0.056386963

so my pontiff's with the film our first being I do think the acting for the most part is really good in this movie Elsie Fisher is definitely,0.103145465
I think the best element of this entire film in my opinion,0.10340967
I really do think she gives a really great performance as Kayla she's fantastic,0.15704215
she gives a lot of you know emotion,0.1855485
and a lot of you know a lot of quirks that you would see in you know a kid like this around this time,0.22818746
you know I mean because that's what I think I really liked about this movie too is that it's kind of really relatable because I think anybody can kind of relate to being like a shy kind of almost awkward teenager around this time,0.117617995
and you know I will admit I was very much like that hell,0.5119908
I can still be like that sometimes to be honest just for you kind of be a little bit awkward than just you know not knowing what to say and stuff like that sometimes I found the labra relatability in that I think Elsie Fisher Wooley bling brings that very well into this,0.17092401
I do think she gives a really great performance in this movie and you know definitely one of my favorites of the year for sure she is fantastic in this and definitely probably my favorite element of the entire film Josh Hamilton is also great in this movie he plays Kayla's a father and he was great too like my favorite scene in this entire movie is like a personal conversation between the two of them,0.03748626
it's really fantastic like really how Josh Hamilton you know kind of gives his performance in that team that's fantastic,0.105357185
I really loved you know um,0.07110132
oh you know I'm kind of tried to be the cool,0.08855579
you know kind of quirky dad and you know Kayla's kind of not like you know please stop but I actually like that you know I mean I thought it made it well with each other,0.2734283
I thought they actually had some good chemistry with each other like I like their back and forth whenever they would interact with each other like I thought Elsie Fisher and Josh Hamilton actually had some really great chemistry with each other you know like whenever they had seamed together,0.09598631
I was actually really great to be honest because the two just had some great chemistry with each other,0.08369951
so yeah Josh Hamilton I thought was really fantastic in the movie and I would say most of the rest of the acting is very good here,0.11856776
- you know the movie does have some really good acting,0.0787808
here you know I do think of the most part everyone does their job very well,0.074901156
um no I like this kind of just this character study of like,0.080606245
like I said before this teenager going through the last week of eighth grade you know going into high school cuz you know and can kind of be a bit,0.14476714
scary you know I mean because it's high school you know big big deal whatever you know I mean so it kind of puts a lot of pressure on Kayla and you do see that in the film I do like that a,0.109191254
lot and you know like I said gives a lot of great length ability,0.07303875
cuz I'm pretty sure everyone can kind of relate to,0.049118597
this and really can you feel,0.069915414
this,0.05212481
and I do think the movie does a very good job of that I like how it presents itself with that in the film I thought they did a very nice job of that in this movie,0.06266486
and yeah I thought they did a really good job with it on the soundtrack is really good to hear I thought the soundtrack was also really good in this movie I quite like the soundtrack a lot definitely some of the best use of music I've seen all year to be honest like I really liked the soundtrack a lot here um the humor now it's not like a straight up comedy or anything,0.09277407
but there is some humor that is implemented into this movie it's the most part,0.057107504
I do think it's really really good especially one scene in particular that I'm now go okay,0.10788873
I'll just say her dad walks into onto something,0.14821045
it's pretty funny to be honest like I was literally like dying of laughter like I wrote I loved you if I was really funny,0.24076833
so yeah there are some times where the movie does use some humor in the film I thought was very well handled to be honest the writing is really great to hear I do think the movie has a really great screenplay in my opinion I did like the screenplay a lot with this film the directing is really good here too it's very well shot,0.09667134
the editing is also really good as well and the cinematography is very good here too like I do think the cinematography is actually really nice in this movie,0.056850694
so yeah I would say the directing overall is very good here,0.10865893

I do think for the most part it does move and a nice solid pace,0.058019724
you know,0.07163658
so yeah I did think the movie did move at a nice solid pace for the most part,0.054159302
now there are some negatives I do have with this film,0.06767283
and the negatives are first being I do think some of the acting can be a little bit stiff,0.18269293
that points are some points where I do think the acting can be a little bit stiff especially from this one character,0.08901638
that's supposed to be the L,0.0739274
the typical mean girl,0.31089434
and you know I thought her acting was kind of a bit stiff,0.49912837
and I can go for some of the other people at times during this movie as well and yeah really I thought just some of the acting like I said for the most part really the acting is very good here in this movie but there are some points where I did think he kind of got a little bit stiff,0.13162161
some of the humor doesn't really work for me,0.07470916
I know there's this one scene that involves a banana that everyone's talking about and really thinks it's hilarious to me,0.1534762
I thought that was just kind of and like I thought that was just kind of very like poorly executed in my opinion I just didn't think it was all that done well to be honest like there are some points where the humor just didn't work for me,0.14919151
I thought I was kind of like okay,0.08438312
and lastly my biggest issue with this movie is that some of the pacing when it gets slow it gets like really really slow,0.1292941
there are some points where kind of drags it out a bit in my opinion,0.10374024
Mike except for the most problems very invested into the movie,0.07471325
I thought the pacing was really good,0.07939665
but there are some moments where the would the pacing kind got a little bit slow,0.14391999
and you know it can drag out a little bit for me,0.21983945
so yeah that's all I really got to say in terms of negatives with this movie overall,0.11377036
I would say eighth grade is a very good movie in my opinion,0.10849663
I did quite like the film a lot,0.056411564
