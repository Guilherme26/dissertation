Mad Max fury road I normally reserved like movie reviews for my tech Channel but today is something special in a history of Australian cinema,0.14916004
there's very few movies that are as iconic as Mad,0.30953103
Max Mad Max 2 was probably considered one of the most epic a pop apocalyptic car action movies of possibly all-time and it definitely set a style and a theme that people have tried to replicate in the past for me I'm gonna be very very biased,0.12261289
because of what you Mad Max - so many times as a child growing up and as an adult and it would,0.37342578
rage probably one of my all-time favorite movies along comes Mad Max for fury road with,0.30237934
Mad Max 3 didn't live up to the expectations as it would hardly be able to of Mad Max,0.18021066
2 and so here we come - Mad Max,0.1530807
fury road,0.06557732
so I saw some of like their previews and some of the pictures and to me the vehicles looked sort of over-the-top and I didn't really have any excitement or really a great interest to watch it I kind of thought it might have been a little bit of a letdown,0.0848361
but the movie come and had a look on Internet Movie Database and everyone's given it on 8 9 10 out of 10,0.10981421
I thought wow it must be okay,0.073475465
and then a movie reviewer and Australia gave it a 5 out of 5 and I thought maybe there's Thompson about this maybe that's worth going to check out,0.07525893
and so I went to the cinemas to support the the creation of the movie into and to basically show my interest and support for the movie and man,0.059371598
I was belonging the way,0.0415092
so let me just give you like an insight into Mad Max Mad Max was played by Mel Gibson and there's no possible way that another actor could capture the the heart and the soul of the character that was Mad Max it was created by Mel Gibson,0.17556125
this is not going to happen,0.095879495
and so the first part of the movie that you know he's going to sort of cause,0.09581765
the problem is Mel Gibson is not in it no matter what your opinion of Mel Gibson is Mel Gibson created the character Mad Max and he did a really really good job,0.14299124
and that was sort of like he's sort of early days acting,0.0945205
so forget about whatever your views are on well Gibson,0.15133603
Mel Gibson is a good actor and Mad,0.31089434
Max Mel Gibson isn't Mad Max and so well just forget about the character of Mad Max at the moment and we'll just focus on on the theme and the heart of Mad Max it's an apocalyptic world where gasoline is the most valuable substance that there is water seems to hold a little value and food you don't even hear about except in dog food Mad Max 2 and and and so pretty much straight away they've that managed to capture the heart of what Mad Max 2 was where you know you had your vehicle and your vehicle was was the life,0.13485123
you know it was the thing that got you from A to B,0.17929111
but you're out of trouble and basically it was a life and so Mad Max and his vehicle was a key part of of the movie,0.31089434
and the truck the truck being such a menacing vehicle is another key area of the movie,0.057535782
and so the movie starts off with Mad Max and it's a little bit of a letdown at the beginning for me,0.15790705
so Tom Hardy plays Mad Max and there's no point trying to compare him to the original Mad Max,0.1888925
so George Miller the director of the original one has come back for this movie,0.06254519
and uh I don't think anyone else could have done it except him,0.1518805
and so the Tartan Mad Max and he's sort of character role it sort of pushed to the side,0.17515296
and I think that was a really smart move,0.07161358
and that the focus of the character of the movie was pushed more into Charlie's Theron,0.059320718
and I quite a fan of her and let me just start by saying that the way that her character come onto the screen with something that was missing,0.070743866
I'm trying to give away spoilers with this set her character up for an immediate,0.20873405
development and immediate interest and not feeling sorry for her but wanting to kind of learn more so they put more character development on to her character which i think was a really really smart move,0.092529215
so now we're going to get Tom Hardy so Tom Hardy did a good job I thought you know I tried to forget about the comparisons,0.07176528
and I I think he did a good job as as a as Mad,0.42763093
Max not a great job,0.15342966
but it's impossible for him to do that it's just not gonna happen,0.088423625
so you know he did the best job that,0.06381205
he could Charlie Theron was the standout of the movie but she was designed to be the standout of the I'm sorry sorry sorry she was not the standout of the movie the movie is based around the vehicles the apocalyptic environment that said that that question of thirst for gasoline and you know that's sort of what drives you on,0.05988853
so I think the movie lost its passion and drive for gasoline and the focus was instead on on people,0.11689455
and I guess that's just the direction that they wanted to go on an amazing,0.028746396
but Mad Max is about the vehicles the apocalyptic environment and the ride and they captured their heart of Mad Max and the the driving and an action they captured it to a tee,0.09422975
it was it was cinematic perfection with cars,0.0985913
you know it's kind of like a car chase,0.09433749
but the way that they portrayed it in the action and the vehicles like when I saw the vehicles on screen when you saw them all together that over-the-top appearance of them was sort of merged into just awesomeness,0.03050724
you know just spectacular almost like military precision of an attack formation of row grade you know in an apocalyptic environment sorry,0.27529457
and so you know the the movie is based around the chase and the taste is like almost to our events and they somehow managed to sort of have the action you know it's dark like I sort of started a little bit,0.08559717
I know so I'll let you down a little bit and you've got a little bit of character development and the characters that they used in the movie were some of the old characters in the original movies which I thought was really good and you know they had the bad guy and they definitely captured sort of what I think they tried to capture in Mad Max 3 but they did it quite well in this movie of the of the people in the environment,0.1241628
and then the character developed come up and then you know a little bit of action and started to come on and then it sort of just ramped up and actually just kept ramping up and ramping up and ramping up and then you've got like a little bit of a while with a little bit of more character development,0.102260515
and then back in some more action and then kind of it flowed,0.07428917
I thought quite well to the point where you know it's a good movie where you lose sense of time and you sort of get really wrapped up into the movie itself,0.17202383
so I had like accent a little bit of character development action,0.0997955
partes great cinematography great car stunts the cars themselves were they were over the top,0.08560964
but it that was kind of like the essence of Mad Max you know the whole world was based around gasoline and your vehicle,0.15537672
and so it was it was over-the-top but it yeah it created that sense of of the of the world in the environment and the sort of desperation that it was that the characters and white dark,0.026137792
I loved a little bit strange and very strange to hear them talk in a very casual almost an Australian style accent so that was a little bit of a sort of a little bit of us how off but it was it worked fine to anthem ad so I'm giving the movie ten out of ten because I'm completely biased and yep and so basically Mad,0.19565554
Max is like the iconic Australian movie and um,0.07451599
I'm hoping that you will support the movie cinemas and the directors and the actors and go see this movie on the big screen it's an action movie involving cars that you will very rarely come across Mad Max 2 was really really good,0.095298186
but this was this was the spectacular in its action,0.05408253
and so you know they didn't I guess the focus wasn't really on,0.05076863
Mad Max it was more on ferocious,0.24654426
you Charlie's there on his character,0.101359405
and the cast himself because the movie just you just can't do a Mad,0.31089434
Max movie without Bob Gibson,0.18873769
and so they shifted the focus a little bit off of that to balance it out,0.091871716
I guess and so the movie was very very well balanced,0.060858063
in Tom Hardy you did a great job,0.0868179
and I was quite happy with the performance and yeah so I firmly just seen this on the big screen 3d,0.061350737
I don't think is necessary,0.1154371
but if you want what's in 3d and it's available in 3d you go for it,0.06686587
yeah Dmitry's one of Dimitri two all-time recommended movie experiences Mad Max 2 and that max fury road,0.11155712
