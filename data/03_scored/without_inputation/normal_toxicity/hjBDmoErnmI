to start off this review by saying that this is a request from trailer recuts,0.13430211
and you guys should go check out their channel it's really cool and they have,0.14578325
some really cool videos and thank you so much for the request i was actually,0.040351894
planning on rewatching this movie anyway and this was at a perfect time and if,0.13936953
any of you guys have any requests or any type of video you guys want,0.18514405
to see on my channel make sure to leave them down in the comments in,0.27389517
any of my videos because i'm always checking and looking for new ideas but yeah,0.09891222
let's talk about the shape of water this is actually a movie that i saw,0.07994853
once i finished watching the 2018 oscars i always watch them and every time a,0.061722945
movie gets a lot of praise i'm really interested in seeing what it was about,0.08157374
especially when at that time i hadn't really watched as many movies as i do,0.059667677
now i didn't really know what the shape of water was when i first saw,0.053343568
it and to be honest i didn't like it that much the first viewing i,0.09286268
remember i saw it that same year 2018 i think i was like a sophomore,0.068630934
in high school i can't remember i didn't really like it as much and i,0.061406963
didn't understand its praise everybody was talking about it and i didn't like it but,0.090801485
i recently saw pan's labyrinth which is also a movie directed by guillermo del toro,0.100544095
and he has amazing movies you can tell he's very passionate about what he does,0.067547806
and he's amazing at production design and color and direction but for me the story,0.05444641
wasn't working the first time i saw it and i'm really really happy to say,0.09536473
that that has changed because i really really liked this movie i can't talk about,0.09094184
this movie enough without mentioning the production design it is so amazing and this movie,0.112264976
is very blue and greenish but it has some hints of that like mint green,0.07529916
from the 60s and 50s and it is just a very beautiful color palette especially,0.034499936
for this movie a lot of this movie is in the dark since sally hawkins,0.15728292
care is a cleaning lady working at night most of it has to do at,0.2069339
night so there's a lot of really dark beautiful scenes that make it possible to,0.08556181
have really beautiful lighting and i think guillermo dodo used that to his advantage it,0.31089434
was so beautiful there are so many beautiful scenes with alleyways and it's just like,0.12136182
a beautiful looking film even this movie had a really bad plot which i used,0.1534109
to think when i first saw it i have always loved the production design and,0.05246264
it is such a beautiful looking movie also something that i love about this movie,0.10393553
is that every single scene doesn't feel out of place everything feels like it flows,0.09607539
correctly it's not one of those movies where there is a random scene of violence,0.17370185
or there's a random scene of this and that like it feels like another director,0.079306394
did it all of this you could tell that it's the same director because it,0.08641071
has a very similar style and i think that's really important when a director has,0.033309083
a specific style because it makes the movie that much better the acting of this,0.07108327
movie is great michael shannon is really scary in this movie and they they have,0.10273945
this guy ripping his own fingers off so he is clearly very menacing and every,0.6188572
single time he came on the screen i wanted to punch him in the face,0.9156528
so he's a very evil character and his acting was great he's always really good,0.56235605
as well in everything that he does and you have octavia spencer she's kind of,0.14527565
like her friend at work and is always trying to help her and i really,0.07556227
liked her addition to the story and she's also always really great there's richard jenkins,0.04509218
and he's like really really nice he's like one of the like the sweetest characters,0.076450735
in the movie and i also really liked his performance can't believe i forgot to,0.07943614
mention the creature dude he also did really good but the one that shines for,0.18151613
me the most in this movie is sally hawkins and she's playing a mute lady,0.3269714
and she doesn't say many words actually she doesn't speak at all in this movie,0.10048407
and she her performance just says so much and that's so amazing because once you,0.10602255
take away something like speaking which is a way of people you know talking about,0.1594842
their emotions it really really allows the movie to be way more interesting because it,0.08151302
shows there's different ways of communicating that don't have to be with your voice and,0.08322087
this is just a very beautiful movie with very like outstanding acting and i just,0.08655154
loved her performance she did so good and everything about her like she portrayed so,0.07199736
many emotions in a movie without ever saying one word and i think that says,0.09630803
a lot about her performance and i'm so happy that at least she got an,0.084476374
oscar nomination because she very well deserved it and her character is obviously the essence,0.17500171
of the story and i really like what they did with her especially that feeling,0.062867835
of not feeling fulfilled with your life and feeling like something's missing that's a very,0.13481179
relevant theme in life in general and obviously in this movie and i definitely really,0.11638206
like what they did with that and i also really enjoyed with the screenplay which,0.054161116
is fantastic how they were able to take something that our main character is feeling,0.06280322
but apply to mostly all the characters actually that's not that i think of it,0.059779752
all of the main characters in the story like every single person in this feels,0.06774599
like they have to fill in some type of like void in the movie and,0.2215118
they feel incomplete and i think what the movie has to say about that is,0.06657768
very interesting as well as human connection as well as just connection and that it,0.18347201
doesn't just have to be human connections and the connection extends from just human to,0.08546281
human and i i thought that the messages of this movie were very beautiful and,0.1763068
i'm really really happy that i rewatched it because when i first saw this when,0.09659627
i was younger i didn't really it didn't click for me i was like okay,0.08157696
this is just weird a weird looking alien dude with a girl i didn't understand,0.41871616
it but it is so much more than than their connection which is of course,0.06766429
very relevant in the movie it and it's not just a love story it's a,0.057725646
lot more than that and this movie has a lot of layers and that's why,0.053064615
i also think it is so amazing and it's it's just really awesome i ca,0.105997965
i don't even know how many other words to say about this because it's just,0.124898106
you have to watch it and see because i think the messages portrayed in this,0.08626885
movie are very important and relevant to a lot of people and i think it's,0.08577727
kind of ironic that such a strange looking movie with a strange plot that can,0.13728793
not happen is very relevant and realistic to a lot of people which i think,0.17648149
that's what makes a movie that much better than other movies honestly the one negative,0.09703643
that i would have with this movie is that some scenes do make me feel,0.1375446
weird and uncomfortable but that's just a personal preference i'm not going to take too,0.0846615
much away from the movie i mean that's what he wanted to do i think,0.096960574
this movie was very bold and what it was trying to do which i really,0.119488195
admire in a filmmaker and in a movie when movies are don't play it safe,0.07251229
and this movie definitely didn't play it safe but just like that's like the one,0.048024017
thing that's kind of weird sometimes i'm like you know but it's just like i,0.13144106
still really enjoy this movie and i'm going to give this movie an a one,0.18190823
of the most original movies i've ever seen he never fails to make an original,0.096428946
movie and his style really really shines and i'm pumped i just want to see,0.13402168
all his movies now which maybe maybe i should do that you know since i,0.099086165
finished watching all the christopher nolan movies maybe i should watch all of his and,0.40310442
make that a series i think that that would be very fun thank you guys,0.075562194
so much for watching and if you guys have seen the shape of water let,0.08073922
me know down below what you thought this movie was actually available on fx i,0.27191764
it was for free i mean i have it with my television so it just,0.09629215
came with that so if you guys have that all you have to do is,0.08711788
go on fx and stretch up the shape of water or if you guys have,0.33655602
already seen it please make sure to let me know what you thought i would,0.08122128
love to hear it and thank you again to trailer recuts for leaving this suggestion,0.11579037
i loved rewatching it and i'm very happy that i did because i love changing,0.05889411
opinions about movies and i think that should be very normalized in the film community,0.05301816
you could hate a movie and then suddenly love it so yeah i really liked,0.32057622
this movie and it was a really fun watch thank you guys again for watching,0.07124404
