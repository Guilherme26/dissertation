being that surprise hit of the year for me I'm a 40 year old guide,0.097627625
the story of the girl dealing with her last week of middle school isn't necessarily,0.10767435
a plotline that's gonna appeal to me unless I don't know the school is being,0.12829277
taken over by rebel forces or they all turn to zombies but the notion of,0.17738962
me personally being able to connect with a teenage girl in a story like this,0.1487244
is a long shot I could still very easily enjoy the film I just think,0.08585758
that relating to the emotional struggles of her character arc I don't know could possibly,0.107435

connect with the main character her internal anxieties genuinely resonated with me and I absolutely,0.10171917
love the journey this story took me on I think this film thrived on three,0.082132205
things the performances the progression of the storyline in the national tone of the dialogue,0.06063069
I had the pleasure of being able to moderate an in theater Q&A after the,0.039223023
film with the lead actresses Elsie Fisher and Emily Robinson and they really did provide,0.05716139
a ton of insight to the methodology behind the filmmaking process in this project this,0.05722864
is the first full feature film for writer director Bo Burnham and I asked them,0.04715523
about the dialogue and Burnham's improvised approach and they've really cemented that notion they talked,0.05069777
about Burnham's mentality of warning the kids to be kids and wanting them to be,0.33966687
the ones who told the story from their perspective Burnham didn't always want the dialogue,0.046248633
to come through him from his perspective they eluded to certain scenes where he would,0.18393458
just toss out a topic and let the performers converse naturally they also spoke much,0.110039964
more in depth he wanted to have the interactions between their two characters specifically to,0.0690035
be much more improvised and I thought it was great because it resulted in a,0.06078814
lot of natural jitters and gestures that really did capture the genuine awkwardness between two,0.059322093
kids of their age perfectly and the more they spoke on the process of shooting,0.5084124
this film the more it solidified why their characters were so easy to connect with,0.058387827
because they weren't necessarily characters all the time and rarely did it feel like they,0.045862805
were delivering lines of dialogue I think this focus on wanting the characters and the,0.059628177
storyline to feel much more natural are what made this that intimate film that's gonna,0.16286385
sweep you up into this story that it's telling you it doesn't amplify moments for,0.10252498
the sake of cinematic storytelling and it doesn't stray into melodramatics when it very easily,0.13176225
could have it was comical at times but it didn't force the laughs and the,0.05984414
script didn't try to land jokes the humor was effectively delivered through just many organic,0.04406088
situations we have all experienced in one way or another which is why they're comical,0.090889394
there is no studio vibe here the framing of the shots and the lighting is,0.10473338
all very simplistic and I think it complements the storyline perfectly to make you as,0.15501541
the viewer feel like you're kind of peeking in on someone's life and watching it,0.1754333
evolve much more than it feels like you're watching performers filling out characters I thought,0.11681896
all the various relationship dynamics were grounded they were sincere and the result is subtle,0.03966105
but very heartfelt and emotionally engaging the main character is simple she's normal most of,0.14091623
us had shades of Kahless personality when we were her age and that's what makes,0.1973708
watching her path through this film so enjoyable so overall I'm gonna give eighth grade,0.2055803
90% on the entertainment meter it was extremely well done it utilizes a vibrant musical,0.046078704
score to add another element to the storytelling and I think my only minor nitpick,0.09816213
about this film was that I wanted some more I wanted a little bit more,0.12203396
between the characters of Kayla and Olivia and possibly a little bit more backdrop to,0.17823745
Kayla's family life but otherwise it was a well-crafted film with charming performances and it,0.10599387
