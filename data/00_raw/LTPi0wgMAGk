[Music] go with portrait of a lady on fire um it just occurred to me that I didn't remember I didn't memorize the names of anybody from this movie [ __ ] I thought about that before oh well apparently this movie was like filmed in 8k I believe and it [ __ ] shows the cinematography is it makes you one just like the like like like bite your nails that the Scimitar fee is so gorgeous and just dripping just soaked in beauty everything every single [ __ ] shot every single [ __ ] shot of this film feels like it should belong in a [ __ ] museum for people to stare at you know the romance it's just so it just like like like a like an ocean wave this movie just like washes over you it just pulls you in and it's just so it's so hypnotic there's surreal moments which I thought was fascinating like there's there is sprinkles of surrealism in this film that really got to me there their romance the romance is just so heart achingly beautiful oh oh and that in the ending oh my god the ending of the film oh also oh my god I mean both of these women are so beautiful but this is their performances are so fantastic this woman is so beautiful oh oh god I just love I love how this movie it doesn't have any music you know and because it doesn't have because it doesn't have music like you can you can almost feel like when they are breathing on each other it's like you can feel it because because of the lack of music you know because of the lack of music like when they're really close together it's almost like you can almost feel their body heat you know kind of like if you're watching a scene that takes place in the winter and like like the scene it just it looks cold and you don't start to feel the coldness does that make sense yeah I tonight 10 out of 10 this is basically sort of like this year's call me by your name basically
