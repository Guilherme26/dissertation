and like had a fun time I leave a Pixar movie my mostly not necessarily probably not with the monsters University at was a little bit different,0.16229802

I mean I wrote in a min a day but it really struck me,0.15321754
and I can't wait to watch the movie again when it comes on blu-ray,0.09043862

she's only child and basically they move from I think Minnesota to San Francisco,0.12980787

I'm sure you probably all know this,0.12015143
I mean who doesn't know what inside-out us about yet,0.20414342

I think it's fat,0.25251064
if ya know I said yeah and my favorite emotion was definitely sadness,0.06659548
