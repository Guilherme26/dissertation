was directed by Frank Capra and stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and assume come,0.102452725
out in 1934 which was only a few years into the sound era but before,0.061409205
the Hays Code era which enforced lots of censorship on films at the start of,0.07330882
this film we see call that Colver she plays a rich woman and she's on,0.31089434
this boat with her father and her father she's trying to convince her not to,0.12883885
marry this man say cold call that Kolbert she wants to marry this man but,0.15610898
her father basically doesn't agree with it really so cool at hobart she escapes in,0.17754799
the boat and she basically tries to escape and go across to New York City,0.05055423
to find the man that she wants to marry so then we see Clark april's,0.0676234
character come in so Clark Gable he plays a man who works for a newspaper,0.08792049
he's always looking for a good story and he comes across call that colder and,0.07235067
he then she realizes that she is on the blunt from her family in order,0.20223689
to marry this man that she wants to marry so Clark they have always thinking,0.24082597
okay I've got a great story here maybe I can make something of this so,0.06323367
this film really does so well is blend comedy with a romance well a rom-com,0.10391435
really obviously and this is one of the best well as opposed to one of,0.08478487
the best classic long comes from the era now I myself I'm not necessarily a,0.057465237
big fan of romantic comedies especially for this sort of era but I think this,0.09833076
is very good this film it's it's actually surprisingly funny I found myself chuckling a,0.11056147
few times I thought it was very funny and lots of bits I really like,0.17884435
Clark Gable in this film I've only seen Clark Gable in one other film gone,0.07839233
with the winds and he was very good in that but he's a lot funny,0.07154696
in this film he has lots of witty lines a lot the things he says,0.08244153
seem very well timed and it's just very funny and I really like a chemistry,0.07358329
between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert every scene they're in together is going to see,0.08979636
quite a lot the film they work off each other really well and the two,0.06002076
characters they're always trying to one-up each other in each scene so as I seen,0.08735504
a star where Clark Gable was trying to get a seat on my bus but,0.06385644
all that Colbert takes a seat first and then the bus driver says it's first-come,0.08125641
first-serve and then later on there's a scene where Claudette Colbert misses her bus so,0.0913581
then quite cables just sat there smiling and it's all these sorts of things which,0.083252706
work really well in making us like these characters and both these actors in these,0.092377886
roles they're both such likeable characters it's impossible not to like these two and it,0.13118394
just makes for a very light-hearted film though are a few darker little bits here,0.23770714
and there it's not happy all the way through but obviously the overall tone of,0.07469564
the film is very happy and very enjoyable now this film did very well at,0.049111966
the Oscars actually won the five big main Oscars which are Best Picture Best Director,0.017182501
for Frank Capra Best Actor for Clark Gable Best Actress for pulled at holder and,0.06259777
Best Adapted Screenplay now there's only two other films or one those all those five,0.065221615
big main Oscars and that is one flow the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975 and then,0.11861946
the silence around in 1991 one of my favorite scenes in this film is when,0.10860327
Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert on a coach together and then everybody on the coach,0.0646746
is singing along to the spans that is playing at the back of the bus,0.096849866
and is playing this song called the man with the flying trapeze and everyone on,0.14853308
the bus kind of joins in with the singing and they all sing different parts,0.09957553
of the verses and it's just a very enjoyable scenes it's a very like all,0.09626524
scenery set on the film really well another scene which is really clever actually is,0.094739236
a scene where Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert trying to hitchhike so staying at the,0.059128698
side of the road and Clark Gable he thinks is really clever he think he,0.15286565
knows all the different ways to get the cars attention by waving her arms in,0.095813446
a certain way or stick a knightly thumb in a certain way and all it's,0.15235358
get the driver's attention and he tries lots of different variants it tries about six,0.05530709
or seven times he throws every time so then call that Kolbert she comes up,0.123339385
and she just sticks her leg out and it says go up above the knee,0.31089434
and then the first driver stop straightaway that's a very funny scene another scene which,0.11135516
is really famous film actually when they're on the bus there's his character called Oscar,0.082006164
Shapley who is sitting next to cool debt Colbert's character and he's a character who,0.08425927
talked to really quickly and he's obviously very attracted to pull that whole box so,0.11166654
he gets so he's saying all these things that are trying pressor and he's just,0.09595879
a very funny quite annoying character and there's a few very funny scenes which is,0.23053437
in which stand out quite a lot and his character was actually part of the,0.042176954
inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny and it was actually a scene where Clark,0.075103216
Gable is leaning on a fence and is eating the carrot and that also was,0.097994864
actually part of the inspiration for the character of Bugs Bunny as well in terms,0.065317154
of what I don't like about this film I suppose the plot is a little,0.10492984
bit predictable especially the the way the film ends is quite standard really you almost,0.09957334
expect it to end a certain way well I did anyway from my point of,0.11221125
view I found ending a little bit predictable not that's a bad thing but there,0.11188689
are some other romance films particularly ones like Casablanca which end in a way that,0.08878465
you don't expect roses film ends in a way which I was expecting I could,0.13350901
almost see it going in this direction and I wasn't surprised by how the film,0.07858211
ended at all I was not to say that I didn't like how the film,0.106400065
ended I did like the way it ended but it just it wasn't that surprising,0.099596195
perhaps a little bit predictable but again that's not necessarily a bad thing so all,0.07251415
in all I have to say that it happened one night is a fantastic romantic,0.07010502
comedy I think most people should be able to enjoy this it's it's a fairly,0.1002153
easy film to watch these two characters quite a bond call that although they're both,0.08834127
such likeable characters in this film the on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic and overall it's,0.06920408
a very enjoyable film to watch so I'm going to give and one night a,0.15173113
rating of 8 out of 10 I don't think it's a fantastic bill but I,0.097292416
do think it's a very good classic romantic comedy and probably one of the best,0.15020002
romantic comedies from this sort of error that I've seen so there we go so,0.118839346
that is it happened one night so what do you guys think have you seen,0.07660642
it happen tonight would you like to see it let me know down in the,0.18879467
