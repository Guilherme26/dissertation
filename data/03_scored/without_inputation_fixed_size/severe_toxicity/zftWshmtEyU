I've been seeing way too many good movies lately I feel like I need to,0.017063957
watch some bad ones to balance it out you know I'm not complaining about all,0.047511406
the good movies but I feel like my sample pools a little skewed your ghosts,0.065023035
let the most is not so slowly becoming one of my favorite directors the lobster,0.044701673
blew me away two years ago and ever since I've just been inhaling his work,0.16470146
which is why I went and saw the favorite at the New York Film Festival,0.012776848
which was its US premiere now technically I didn't see the US premiere that showing,0.022751942
was at 6:30 and there was a Q&A with your ghost lamp the most and,0.031813737
I think Emma Stone was there I cut a smaller showing with no QA about,0.11372778
half an hour later so technically I saw the second u.s. showing of this film,0.08257457
and Wow for a period piece I can already tell this film is gonna sweep,0.072249584
the technical categories production design costume design hair and makeup all that good stuff it's,0.029350564
not just that they were impressive period sets and period costumes because I've kind of,0.017755747
come to expect that a proper period piece will already have those I'm probably taking,0.029203558
it for granted but that's just an expectation of mine at this point but there,0.017523598
are so many little things that cater to the absurd nature of the film stuff,0.0595213
like eggplant earrings you know it's all these all these small things that really pushes,0.121458545
the film above and beyond typical period piece attire and the sets aside from being,0.01905352
impressive Palace sets have such a McCobb Eicher to them which is kind of ironic,0.08013268
because the film wasn't nearly as dark as I expected it to be not that,0.04536885
I was disappointed by that looking at his last three films the lobster is kind,0.061308645
of a balance between seriously dark and comedic Lee dark the killing of a sacred,0.1574789
deer has dark comedy but it's mostly serious and then on the other end of,0.020078568
the spectrum this film is a comedy not in a bad way though not that,0.053788744
the tension is broken by the comedy it's more like phantom thread where it uses,0.071738064
comedy to convey it's heavier more serious themes and the tension in this film is,0.013826507
still incredibly powerful I don't know how lanthum OHS does it year after year he's,0.050444867
been in such command of the films he's released his direction is top-notch this film,0.043747135
is a little different he's toned down the monotone delivery which I realize is an,0.045195904
ironic but what I mean is the actors convey a lot more emotion in their,0.018438226
their dialogue and their mannerisms than in lanthum OSes previous films that said it's still,0.050581895
very much a your ghost lanthum of film it's still jam-packed with idiosyncrasies and I,0.28904188
think this film is actually a great example of the difference between a quirky film,0.040336736
and an idiosyncratic film quirky I think is more of an aesthetic term where is,0.08601157
idiosyncratic implies that there is a meaning or theme hidden under all these small things,0.09099712
looking at Wes Anderson for instance he's kind of a mixed bag of quirks and,0.13115293
idiosyncrasies but I think LAN themost is mostly idiosyncratic although I'd argued that the dialogue,0.21411863
in the killing of a sacred deer is quirkier than it is idiosyncratic and just,0.09618822
to be clear there's nothing wrong with quirkiness I don't want this to become a,0.03714053
thing where like pretentious people use idiosyncratic and only normies use quirky like I don't,0.08027769
watch movies I watch films no they're just very similar words with slightly different meanings,0.0633461
moving past that digression let the Moe's approach this film with an aesthetic affinity for,0.029771624
extremes there are shots with extremely open exposure the highlights just dominating the frame he,0.04656219
uses these crazy wide-angle lenses some of which are so extreme you can see both,0.09130577
ends of a hallway or a road within the same frame and sometimes he uses,0.04120214
these crazy wide-angle lenses and opens the exposure up at the same time the title,0.13771696
design pushes the centering of text to its extreme there are even shots that are,0.042042267
really dark and have extreme noise that however I found to be a little distracting,0.024602482
and I probably would have preferred if you used a little more light and those,0.02214862
scenes that said it didn't happen that often and mostly the shots were astonishing even,0.043016095
the editing is extreme we have these extreme J&L cuts cuts that begin before the,0.019153964
scene is over or carry on after the next scene has begun there were scenes,0.04062343
in this film that we hear the audio for as early as the previous scene,0.032120388
begins the film is broken up into chapters and the first chapter has a very,0.017801644
clear first act structure this whole first act they're just setting up dominoes and as,0.04423471
soon as the first chapter ends and we see the title card for the second,0.02410559
chapter it's like they put this elaborate domino setup into motion and we see the,0.019622253
rivalry but I'm a stone and raychel wisest characters develop and play out I will,0.037298843
say that the third act of this film could have been a bit shorter they,0.03403878
they dragged out some of the events just a little too much that said I,0.03232593
was having such a good time watching this movie that I didn't even mind all,0.044583935
that much the very last shot of this movie layers so many different images over,0.042422753
each other I feel like the word trippy is probably selling it kind of short,0.06296961
there's so much information the film is giving us letting us ponder the conclusion of,0.009320553
the film it's it's amazing this is really a perfect companion piece to bury London,0.113496296
which also criticizes 18th century English royalty naturally the sets and costumes have a lot,0.0138744
of similarities but where Barry Lyndon tried to recreate the era as authentically as possible,0.04282386
and have chastised well characters within this authentic setting the favorite in addition to a,0.012941148
lot of authenticity portrays this era in a sort of heightened reality layering on a,0.03308291
decent amount of absurdism there's a scene where Rachel Liza's character Sarah is dancing with,0.076398335
some guy I don't remember if it was Nicholas Hoult or not and the way,0.03352592
the dance is framed and lens and the actual choreography of the dance itself is,0.017010076
so ridiculous it's like your ghost lanthum oz is physically standing there laughing in the,0.36357144
face of 18th century royalty so needless to say this film is far less subtle,0.08514018
than Barry Lyndon not that that's a bad thing they're just different ways of approaching,0.034972694
the subject matter there's even a scene in this movie that almost directly recreates the,0.03339621
recital scene from Barry London the three best performances this year are all in this,0.022751942
movie I thought I'm a stone was pretty good in la-la land I didn't think,0.028608218
her role was very demanding nor her character all that complex she did as much,0.023498943
as she could with it but this is the performance that makes her worthy of,0.027397584
being an Academy Award winner she's she's incredible here as is rachel wise and Olivia,0.049558178
Colman does such an amazing job taking a character that could very easily be a,0.025376756
caricature and breathing so much humanity into her not only are these the three strongest,0.2882215
performances but also the three strongest characters I've seen this year they're each so dynamic,0.014752443
on their own but as a three-person group the dynamics among each other are so,0.063355416
richly layered and complex I haven't seen a pair of characters as diametrically opposed as,0.014279497
Abigail and Sarah since there will be blood probably just such a strong understanding of,0.08585725
who these people are by everyone working on the film so these two are certainly,0.012124968
strong characters opposing each other and then we have Olivia Coleman's character Queen Anne who's,0.059310436
in the middle and she's really more of a vehicle or even more so a,0.034803737
MacGuffin for these two to fight over that said it's totally unclear which of any,0.065153405
of the three of these people are the main character and probably has the most,0.033861175
screen time but it's Abigail and Sarah who were battling for her and even then,0.024379646
they have equal screen time and development naturally I'd say we want to view Sarah,0.021094304
as the protagonist and Abigail is the antagonist but none of these characters are good,0.016147332
or bad the film starts out and Sarah's being ruthlessly mean to Anne meanwhile we,0.03813764
see Abigail is thrown in the mud she's jerked off - we see her sleeping,0.46951222
on the ground she burns her hand she's got this messed-up backstory so immediately we,0.3266764
have these associations with the characters but then we see how much of Sarah's rudeness,0.016694779
is out of love and we see just how conniving Abigail can be but not,0.02676566
all of Sarah's behaviors out of love she's equally as conniving as Abigail and we,0.08774105
totally see where abigail is coming from going into this situation so there's a lot,0.033011734
of moral ambiguity going on which as you probably know I have a weakness for,0.047673047
I can't help but love a good morally ambiguous story as I mentioned each of,0.02406834
these characters is acted to perfection I almost feel bad for Nicholas Hoult because he's,0.027970307
got a great character and he gives a good performance but he's so out staged,0.043659993
by the main three that it's easy to forget he's even in the movie at,0.025410015
first I was surprised to find that this was a Fox Searchlight film and not,0.09952145
a 24 considering it's your go slant the most and then I found out that,0.07759101
your go slant the most didn't write the script for this film which was even,0.068163365
more surprising because he's always written his own scripts but even more surprising than that,0.019515824
is who the screenwriters are believe me when I tell you that this is the,0.016444005
strongest script of the year stronger even than probably any film that came out last,0.033112176
year and it was written by two people named Deborah Davis and Toni McNamara this,0.064337894
is Davis's only IMDB credit and it looks like McNamara was mostly just a staff,0.011860224
writer on some not very popular TV shows he also wrote and directed an Australian,0.038479544
film called the rage and placid lake which received mixed reviews as well as a,0.042157345
film called Ashby which received less than stellar reviews who are these people and how,0.0426569
did they write such a phenomenal script and if they are well-known people then how,0.041929852
come I didn't know about them and how come this is Davis's only IMDB credit,0.019354183
it makes no sense it doesn't add up I can't I can't wrap my mind,0.045279715
around it the script is too good for nobodies to have written it doesn't make,0.0269865
sense not only is the character writing in this film god-tier but it's endlessly quotable,0.03992033
there's a scene where this guy walks into a begins room and she asks him,0.081688546
are you here to seduce me or rape me and he goes I'm a gentleman,0.7373111
and she goes so rape it is then that's the kind of humor that's persistent,0.5753298
throughout the whole film it's so fresh and biting and there are so many great,0.043208998
one-liners like that despite the fact that Lant the most didn't write this script I,0.04616175
totally understand why he chose to direct it it's thematically consistent with his other films,0.045344237
and here I'm gonna get into a few spoilers so if you don't want to,0.19599171
hear go to this time so in the end abigail becomes a lady and Sarah's,0.052967243
exiled from England and their final interaction totally changes the way we view this whole,0.1699624
dispute Sarah's about to leave and she says to Abigail you really think you've won,0.05643418
and Abigail says something like half an eye and Sarah says we're playing very different,0.03717113
games now at first I thought this meant that Sarah had some plan to win,0.02094996
back ends affection and somehow defeat Abigail but then I realized that no more had,0.026976522
to be done I watched the last shot his Abigail is rubbing Anne's legs and,0.372444
their faces are juxtaposed on top of each other as the shots of rabbits layer,0.21343414
and layer and then the movie ends my very initial reaction was oh it's over,0.042060893
but as the credits rolled the image suddenly made sense or maybe not the image,0.020959936
but the ending I realized that that moment was the film's logical conclusion Abigail thought,0.012563324
she had won because she was now a lady and thus untouchable was that really,0.028050128
what the battle was over what now now that she's a lady keep faking love,0.29728615
for the Queen sara has that whole monologue about how she tells Anne when she,0.045524504
looks like a badger because she loves her and Anne realizes now that Sarah's been,0.09268004
exiled that she must up she lost her love and now she's stuck with Abigail,0.25165766
who she now realizes has been using her this whole time and Abigail knows that,0.049856845
Anne knows and now they're stuck in this awkward relationship the rabbits serving as a,0.07657727
constant reminder of Abigail's fake love and this is the game that Sarah was talking,0.04224515
about and really Sarah won because she's still the one that Queen Anne loves and,0.048020273
Abigail may be a lady now but that doesn't mean anything other than a better,0.028557664
bed to sleep in better clothes to wear and better food to eat which is,0.06491926
heartbreaking but you realize that Abigail put herself in this position by using the Queen,0.033571154
and it's just such a beautiful conclusion juggling so many different contradictory feelings the direction,0.041730963
and performances are great in this movie but it's really the script above everything else,0.027191376
that impressed me here's my prediction and there are many films I haven't seen yet,0.028705334
this year this film is gonna win best production design and best costume design your,0.0349115
ghost lanthum host will be nominated for Best Director Robbie Ryan will be nominated for,0.03552746
Best Cinematography the film will be nominated for best hair and makeup and best film,0.018839331
editing nicholas hoult will be nominated for Best Supporting Actor any of these three actresses,0.0968993
hopefully all three of them will be nominated for Best Lead Actress one of them,0.0354197
will win if any of them are nominated for Best Supporting Actress she will win,0.03370552
the film will be nominated for Best Picture now awards are arbitrary but I do,0.017020054
believe that there's somewhat important in recognizing talented artists and while lanthum OHS has been,0.02051892
snubbed in the past the Academy has a certain affection for period pieces and I,0.025316224
think this will be the lanthum OHS film to catch their attention for me it's,0.05750579
a super super super strong 9 out of 10 but I'd like to watch it,0.074496575
a few more times before I can confidently decide whether or not it's worthy of,0.018996315
being a 10 out of 10 it's a very close second to the lobster but,0.023437746
all of his films are so good it's really hard to compare see this movie,0.066977344
if not for yourself then for me and if you have seen it then let,0.04040658
me know what you think in the comments thank you for watching and I'll see,0.015105655
