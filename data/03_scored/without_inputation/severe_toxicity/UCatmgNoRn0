so I just drove three hours total to see a three and a half hour,0.024623768
movie in the theater so that's six and a half hours of my time was,0.032931913
it worth it what does that flick fans and welcome back to my channel today,0.020153068
we're talking about the brand new Netflix original film the Irishman this thing drops on,0.054400712
Netflix on the 27th I fortunately found a theater that was semi closed to me,0.031831034
and I said you know what I'm going today we're going to talk about it,0.023655927
let me know in the comments are you a fan of Martin Scorsese and were,0.019697418
you excited for this film let's talk about it so world war ii veteran and,0.36043933
mob hitman Frank the Irishman Sheeran recalls his possible involvement with the story of union,0.11224508
leader Jimmy Hoffa in honesty time I love Martin Scorsese one of the best directors,0.034882896
clearly working right now and some of the best actors of all time in this,0.020221584
movie together I was excited for this film but not as excited as some others,0.08461535
because I was um I was nervously hesitant because of the integration of this D,0.03650129
aging technology and the fact that this film is so long it's going to Netflix,0.041339833
there were just so many things that we're making me nervous and I saw the,0.032077815
trailer and I really liked the trailer but I'm like huh I'm just I'm not,0.025828416
excited as I should be once again Martin Scorsese Robert DeNiro Al Pacino ha Joe,0.0459602
Pesci Harvey Keitel oh my good go on for days Bobby Cannavale II Ray Romano,0.07105758
everyone is in this film and it is a movie that is very long like,0.029836813
I said three and a half hours actually past that especially if you are like,0.031596888
me and you're just sitting through the credits go on you just gotta take a,0.099522114
breath after a movie like this because it really knocks the breath out of you,0.097481996
this is the story of one man's entire life not necessarily from beginning to end,0.03098492
but it focuses on the reflection of Frank's life what he did to build up,0.021212706
to that integral moment in the film and then the aftermath right it's not just,0.010552473
boom and the movies over no we get time to sit and breathe and really,0.032335907
think about what just happened it feels like every time we get an intense moment,0.02913704
and trust me some of the most intense moments you will see all year are,0.019290991
in this film we get chance to reflect upon it think about it for five,0.019321589
to ten minutes with our characters and let me tell you guys the acting in,0.031912185
this movie is as good as you were anticipating it to be Robert De Niro,0.032373156
is fantastic Joe Pesci he's back it's so good to see him back playing a,0.06340664
very different character normally or most of the time when people think of Joe Pesci,0.027922414
and a Martin Scorsese movie they think of the exaggerated and over-the-top character that's what,0.015454211
Al Pacino gives us in this film which is similar to what he normally does,0.026199589
but Pesci plays a very more subdued character he's kind of the guy in charge,0.058679175
this time and everything runs through him and I really like seeing that side of,0.061583366
him not that we're going to see him again in the future because he's been,0.062903754
out of the game for a while he came back for this film and oh,0.04339525
my gosh does he not absolutely kill it so those two actors were on top,0.48323184
of their game but my favorite performance may actually be Al Pacino even though he,0.02743816
is playing a similar character to what we've seen him play before Jimmy Hoffa is,0.006727002
a different person with different intentions in this guy man any time he gets let,0.07144538
off of his leash he goes crazy he talks so much in this movie and,0.19580944
he's always talking people out of how they feel and talking them back into how,0.06690351
he feels that's just the kind of guy that Jimmy Hoffa is and they even,0.046306096
say in the movie not a lot of young kids are going to know who,0.052460372
Jimmy Hoffa is after this film if you all get the opportunity to see it,0.03653388
even if it is on Netflix not on a big screen everyone know who Jimmy,0.02274662
Hoffa is because Al Pacino is phenomenal in this movie just incredible and Scorsese's Direction,0.03243502
is as good as you anticipate it to be now it is a different feeling,0.027781395
film it even looks different from his previous more recent efforts you compare this to,0.03216429
something like wolf of wallstreet it's like wolf of wallstreet has a very specific color,0.06647513
palette and has a very specific over-the-top exaggerated look to it I love that movie,0.027732836
so much this is very different this is a movie starring older gentleman it's not,0.034634117
necessarily going to be for the young crowd if they just look at it watch,0.030267851
five minutes ago it's not for me give this film a chance because even though,0.053269237
this is a movie intended for the older crowd or intended for Scorsese fans like,0.032872044
myself I think everyone can get something out of this film even if you don't,0.034587555
relate to our main character in Frank who does you know make mistakes in his,0.017616058
life and then at the end of the film he is reflecting upon this and,0.023625992
saying what did I do wrong and I love the way that this story is,0.027325079
told I love how they go about his relationship with his daughter even though they,0.09487847
don't flesh it out in the manner even from what I'm saying you expect them,0.05252955
to flesh it out but they do it very very subtly now if I have,0.050152186
one complaint about that story it's the fact that Anna Paquin who plays his daughter,0.04467573
the older version did not get a lot of screen time with De Niro now,0.015025168
there is a reason for that but I could have used more with that story,0.015340465
maybe just one conversation or one moment with her to speak a bit more because,0.030704211
we did not get a lot from her but that storyline was integral because you,0.048260406
continuously feel how he feels those looks just those really subtle moments that he's giving,0.019950854
his daughter all throughout the movie you feel that and that's what I'll say about,0.059626397
this film it makes you feel it makes you reflect even if you're not that,0.050073028
age and we'll talk about the de-aging here in just a second you're thinking about,0.027593814
your entire life this movie makes you think about death and the consequences of death,0.48278332
not a spoiler it's a mob movie but it's a very different mob movie a,0.042682175
lot of people are going to compare this to Goodfellas maybe before they see the,0.024882525
film and it's an understandable comparison because they are two mob based movies with someone,0.10871761
kind of telling us the story as we go along in a non expositional way,0.026133735
it's important exposition there is a difference between bad exposition and good exposition and this,0.022068132
was very necessary for this story but they're two very different films this one's more,0.022177888
subdued but when the violence happens oh man does it happen and the way that,0.046135142
it's filmed every single time it's just so shocking and we talked about the intense,0.04029749
moments and there's one scene in particular and oh my gosh man edge of my,0.081707165
seat we're already so far into the film it's already been the span of what,0.03352725
two other movies combined would be and I'm still locked in I'm still focused because,0.0443305
of the way score says he tells the story and it's also funny in the,0.021893855
same way that Goodfellas was funny the unexpected humor there are some lines of dialogue,0.021653723
and that are just hilarious from the smoke breaks that they have to take for,0.025505137
their wives on their road trip to the way that Jimmy Hoffa gets frustrated because,0.07066911
a guy shows up to a meeting in shorts and 15 minutes late it's just,0.03359643
constantly throughout the movie you're sad you're intrigued you're a bit upset you're curious as,0.043552235
to what is going to happen next and then you're laughing it's everything that you,0.039660245
want in a theatrical experience now to the d aging there are some moments in,0.023032648
here first sure where you're gonna look at it go I I don't know if,0.04757327
that was perfect and yes it has to do more with the CGI but I,0.022491854
think it's more of the fact that you are D aging the face of course,0.106167965
but you're putting that face on the body now they're obviously going to the hands,0.14122914
and stuff too but on the body of a person who is a bit older,0.26867652
so even though they look younger when they start to walk they're a bit slouched,0.36720014
and they walk like an older person and that's nothing against an arrow it's nothing,0.11292091
against Pacino but you could just kind of tell every now and then that he's,0.062436134
obviously not that young and I had trouble at moments trying to figure out what,0.047909185
age he actually was but I do have to give kudos because the de-aging is,0.0150857
so subtle at points that I didn't even notice it and after about 10 minutes,0.02530026
of watching this with a really long runtime you don't care anymore because you're so,0.0948186
locked into the story and you want him to keep going back throughout the years,0.10376133
and tell more of his relationship with Russell of his relationship with Hoffa and De,0.03392503
Niro is so captivating I mean obviously the best performances any of these guys have,0.0786267
given in quite some time Ray Romano as well and I know I mentioned him,0.023734417
before but I was just shocked at how subdued everyone was in this movie and,0.036940973
then delivering on the jokes when they had to and a lot of people are,0.059442807
going to ask since this reached the heights the level of what a Goodfellas did,0.057462554
it's a very different film that movie focused on one thing this film focuses on,0.017099876
morality and legacy and what did my life mean in the grand scheme of things,0.02395925
and how do I handle the passing of time there are moments throughout the film,0.019217156
where people start to not recognize those that have passed away a long time ago,0.07763624
man and it makes you ask yourself these questions too it's like what does it,0.04289104
all mean and all of this from another Scorsese my movie this film was epic,0.08397611
I'm gonna encourage everybody to watch this seek it out in theaters but don't worry,0.03822877
if you can't find it in theaters it's coming on Netflix like I said now,0.01807703
it may be may be difficult because I feel like a lot of people are,0.029798897
going to try to split this film up into like episodes because it's so long,0.061518844
and I encourage you do not do that sit there locked in get some surround,0.09101641
sound or whatever you need to do to get invested to get locked into these,0.19532053
stories and I promise you it will be worth it and I hope it will,0.10255536
captivate you I need to see the film again for sure because even though it,0.09534676
flew by I do think it was a tad bit too long and like I,0.0666953
said I did question some of the D aging effects otherwise I just I was,0.027684944
so sucked into this film I have to go really high with my score if,0.4381716
you guys enjoyed this video you liked this review hit that thumbs up button it,0.11010652
helps out this video and this channel back to the score 196 percent for the,0.047728255
Irishman my goodness what an incredible time the longest movie I've ever seen in the,0.036521908
theater absolutely worth it thank you so much for watching this video my next video,0.11543796
will most likely be a box office breakdown I want to see the report soon,0.020218257
