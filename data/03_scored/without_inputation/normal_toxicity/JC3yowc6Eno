but there isn't really anything negative to say in my opinion,0.056208644

I think it's really good as well because although obviously attended kids to some extent there's so much for adults there,0.08063512
it's almost possible,0.05063597
there's more for adults than there is for kids,0.065982856
but I was sitting next to a young child and the first viewing and although he didn't seem to entirely follow it he did seem to enjoy himself which I guess the key thing I feel like it might help kids grow up and think about their emotions and how their brains working from an early age so it could be like almost counseling for via cartoons the characters were amazing obviously they were very varied,0.15256035
because they were betraying different spectrum emotions great voice cast Amy Poehler from Parks and Recreation Mindy Kaling from the office and Phyllis Smith from the office as well so great comedians,0.075022876
I also spotted agent Cooper from Twin Peaks as the voice of the Father as we come to expect from Pixar is absolutely beautiful to look at really psychedelic really great character,0.09106476
