named Cleo living in Mexico during the 70s and she works for this family and,0.066872865
she eventually has to look after this family because the family is falling apart but,0.09462976
Cleo herself she's dealing with her own stuff as well and the movie mainly focuses,0.115301296
on Cleo and her life like she is the heart of the story the movie,0.1092506

this film you can tell that Alfonso is honoring this woman clear in his life,0.35000297
she obviously had a big part in his life she obviously helped shape him into,0.16939175
who he is today and I think Alfonso captured this film beautifully he captured it,0.09156288
in such an elegant way Fonzo is basically telling the story of clear and with,0.033320203
all of the family stuff going on he tells that through the perspective of clear,0.05089085
and it's beautifully executed and as I said before Cleary is essentially the heart of,0.25684008

name I'm so sorry but she is fantastic here she delivers a very graceful and,0.11523388
very subtle performance that resonates throughout like it's so powerful and it's her first acting,0.087545715

adds a bit more of that authenticity to the story and Alfonso Curran he carries,0.099740766
and he holds onto these really long tanks of such care and emotion and he,0.07704282

moments like the sounds on the sound design in this film is some of the,0.070604816
best sound design I've heard all year it fully immerses you into this experience in,0.060085222
such a sophisticated way so I don't like to say that a film is a,0.10455891
masterpiece straight away like there have been a couple films this year where I've had,0.27399874
to think about it and over time I'd consider those films to be masterpieces but,0.10307379
Romar like right after watching Roma I would actually consider it to be a masterpiece,0.06186339
a beautiful masterpiece and Roma is probably not just my favorite film this year but,0.055012904
probably in the past couple of years like I just fell in love this film,0.08847457

writer Best Actress Best Cinematography best sound editing best sound mixing and just so on,0.07649421
and so on but I am a bit worried that the Academy they won't really,0.064266406
consider Roma because it's technically being released on Netflix and I feel like Netflix will,0.051985733
get in the way of that but only time will tell and Roma is a,0.036936957
foreign film so it might fall under the foreign feature film category but still I,0.06324372
want Roma to win a bunch of awards okey-dokey guacamole let me know what you,0.15132998
