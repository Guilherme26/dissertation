what's up guys my name is Aaron at the same i'm going to be reviewing,0.0824301
mood light this is a john movie that's directed by barry chickens and the stars,0.14938258
a bunch of people the basic story is telling about this young man Shire own,0.15664856
and it tells his story kind of in three chapters him as a boy and,0.094583884
was a teenager and then him as a man and is talking about like how,0.115334824
how people treat him in the black culture because he's kind of different honestly about,0.45896754
that and how those actions and how those choices that some people made around him,0.075707614
kind of shaped the person that he became I was looking forward to this for,0.24187675
a reason I heard this was like an amazing movie like I've been hearing buzz,0.1514711
about this movie for months so I wanted to give us a try like usually,0.061364915
whatever movies have like this type of hype this kind of rare whenever they actually,0.13955338
kind of meet my expectations you know the last time that actually happened was probably,0.047401976
mad max fury road they'll probably the last time I was like yeah the buzz,0.16480981
for this movie was definitely appreciated but yeah this one I feel like it's going,0.059373416
to go up along with like Mad Max fury road as like a masterpiece movie,0.102889165
I feel like the story again it kind of shows how this boy goes from,0.06444588
childhood into adulthood it kinda reminds me of movie boyhood but I feel like this,0.09154412
is actually a little bit more emotionally involved because you really do care for the,0.24221472
kid because of how strong of a writing is it tells you the story in,0.084754065
three different chapters if it has three different actors playing shine room I feel like,0.07379206
that would kind of be the breaking point for the movie if the actors were,0.08065727
great portraying him and I felt like the actors were really good kind of showcasing,0.08355128
his transformation and I'm like that they did showing in three different chapters because you,0.14803104
kind of have to guess what happened in between those chapters that they're showing you,0.08569285
to kind of see the emotional baggage and the stuff that Shiro and had to,0.05806721
carry and stuff it kind of like forced you to think about it it's kind,0.1693718
of heartbreaking and you know it just makes you kind of think about Tyrone the,0.08754551
writing is pretty simple it's not like a lot of big words or anything like,0.23362395
that but it's pretty effective to me you really do get a sense of caring,0.14464729
for the characters you get a caring for the situation that shy road is put,0.047497615
in and like I like that the writing feels really authentic black culture it doesn't,0.3733993
feel like people are like a pro ready that makes sense i think that the,0.06655519
writers in the director has stuff did a really good job making this feel like,0.04846486
a relatable situation for everybody i do like the messages of the movie to basically,0.058938865
about like masculinity and the black culture and sexuality and black culture things are kind,0.43236265
of touching the black people basically if you're like different from everybody else like kind,0.66050583
of looked down upon a black culture and kind of ostracized and this movie like,0.6050664
really captures the essence of that a fella they did like a really beautiful job,0.24496648
doing that I don't know I just never seen this type of movie done with,0.09229039
black keep when I thought that was really cool like the themes weren't beating you,0.5499601
over the head it was pretty subtle with the way that they did it was,0.08612987
pretty much with the writing the characters that were in the movie I thought that,0.040200353
that really told message is really well and that was a really cool aspect of,0.0500437
it and one of the performances were just like amazing all over there are no,0.08029468
weak points in this at all the three actors that are playing Shiro I've really,0.09207479
felt like that's where the strength of the movie relies on you have to nail,0.16230687
these characters really well and I feel like those actors did a really good job,0.10037597
kind of portraying like the mannerisms that shy Rome carries just the way that he,0.08045195
carries his body his facial expressions I felt like that was really well done just,0.30886978
like no emotional baggage that this character has I feel like that was properly shown,0.1035418
really well these actors I'm just the way that they interacted and stuff like that,0.14504556
in a way that they talked I felt like it was really a parent know,0.06801822
this was the same person that's actually kind of scared because you know it's not,0.1179474
really the same person but the actors just do such a really good job like,0.079002276
making it feel like it is that I felt like that was really cool and,0.0727162
the same thing goes for the actors that plays Kevin chevrons friend Andre Hollen key,0.06903279
was in American Horror Story roanoke I feel like he did a pretty good job,0.09027458
how showcasing that character and doing a really good job with that I'd like no,0.14560959
Amy Harris as shy Ron's like drug addicted mom I felt like she was pretty,0.5559796
good you could see that she had like this kind of inner turmoil about like,0.11912641
being addicted to the drugs and then trying to be there for her son I,0.2754948
feel like she did that really well really show the humanity in that situation Janelle,0.08781409
Monae plays this woman that provides like a safe haven for shine room I feel,0.31089434
like she did a really good job like portraying that nurturing kind of motherly side,0.1227821
I can really see her being really good and when Ruby's she wanted to give,0.13376175
that a try but Mahalo Ali the dude that was Captain mouth and Luke Cage,0.2682735
I thought that he was probably like the best of the supporting characters he plays,0.03080771
this like Street dude who kind of takes in Shiro and he kind of sees,0.31089434
that he's like an outsider and he kind of you know gives him advice on,0.14987834
how to act he's just kind of there for him and he provides kind of,0.15551044
like a safe haven with janelle monae's character and i felt like he was just,0.07888199
really great you could see the humanity kind of just coming off of his body,0.5154597
just his face of the way that he you know just acted around him and,0.276639
then he has a really heartbreaking scene with shower on that was just like really,0.09933538
sad but like that was like probably the saddest scene in the movie after that,0.0986671
he's getting Oscar buzz for this movie and I definitely get it he gives really,0.098711826
great in this movie and I feel like the cinematography was like gorgeous just the,0.07921814
way that the colors are so present each stain the way that the college kind,0.15364096
of show the mood and the tone of the scenes are really cool and I,0.053166334
thought that the camera shots have this like hazy kind of dreamlike vibe to them,0.16993077
where the character kind of been focused than everything else is just like really fuzzy,0.08847341
I really like that effect to this is really like a beautifully shot but kind,0.18930927
of available movie and I did like that vibe yeah overall I thought this was,0.07041444
the best movie of the year and one of the better movies I've seen past,0.04199931
few years I just thought that the plot in the writing was just so simply,0.0760598
done but just so effective the way they kind of convey these emotions the themes,0.07307361
were really subtle but you do get them you do get the kind of things,0.115415975
that shy realms character is dealing with the performances are really great all the way,0.07434828
from shy roads actors playing Kevin and all the supporting characters that are kind of,0.044912018
around them and I thought that the cinematography the way the movie was shot was,0.1492218
really beautiful it wasn't like super showy but it was just kind of a centrally,0.18098302
gorgeous the way that it was done overall I would give us an A+ yeah,0.07717817
