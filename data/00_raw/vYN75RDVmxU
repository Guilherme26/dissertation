hey guys so I went to watch Wonder Woman okay so we all know that the most anticipated movie of the summer was Wonder Woman now did it live up to a type I personally like to think that yes Wonder Woman did live up to the height if you see the final trailer for Wonder Woman that trailer does justice to the movie I mean just like every other action movie and stuff it could really go bad but in my opinion I thought this movie was fantastic and my favorite part of movie was how they wrote these characters how these characters were portrayed so you have these characters Diana and Steve truck now the thing that I love most about them was the fact that yes Diana Wonder Woman she is powerful she's strong she's indestructible she's amazing she is Wonder Woman and then you have Steve Trevor who's just a soldier he's just an average not average guy but I really liked how they didn't make him weak to make her look strong I feel like that is a huge problem with TV shows movies books that a lot of the times just to make a female character stronger they usually write the male characters as weaker stupid and just overall horrible just to make the female characters look stronger now for me that is a cheap way to write a story and characters you do not need to make one character weaker in order to make another character look stronger that's just my personal opinion sorry I had to get that out there anyway but here I love how this showed that she needed him and the rest of the guys and he needed her as well they really tag-teamed and that's what I really love about this movie he was strong and he was fierce and he had a good head on his shoulders but so was she and I think their partnership was fantastic now the next thing that I really loved about this movie was Diana's morals I love that even in the face of battle and everything she has a strong belief and your belief that keeps you going I mean for me this movie is kind of like you mix the story of Percy Jackson with Captain America and bam you get this woman movie because this movie shows a lot of Mythology but it also took place during World War Two and Diana really reminds me of Steve Rogers I know I don't know I'm probably the only one that thinks that they're just so innocent and pure they just wanted to send people even though they know that they're flawed and they could be horrible but it's just their inner drive to help people no matter who they are and that's what I absolutely love about Wonder Woman she's fierce she kicks butt she is just amazing but at the same time she has a heart of gold she really wants to help humanity so overall I loved loved loved this movie while I was watching those fight scenes I was like yes this movie is what we need so now I'm doing the questions to you guys what did you think about the characters in Wonder Woman do you think they were well-developed what did you overall think about the Wonder Woman movie and if you haven't seen it are you planning on watching it let me know on the comments below so if you're new to my channel I post a brand new video every single week talking about random stuff and all my social media links are on the down bar below if you guys want to know what I'm up to on a daily basis so yeah so thank you guys so much for watching and I'd like to guys next time
