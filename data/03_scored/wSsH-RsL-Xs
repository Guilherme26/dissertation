hi I'm Andre and I'm a black nerd nice to see you again on my,0.6564126
channel and a special shout-out to my subscribers you asked me to review the movie,0.12702695
get out which I actually saw a couple weeks ago they had a special influencer,0.15227231
screening but it was really cool the cast was there Jordan Peele key and Peele,0.050994582
Fame who wrote and directed this movie was their chance the rapper was hosting the,0.042675182
Q&A so that's different that's pretty cool but yeah it was a little cool event,0.050287563
and it was nice to see the people whatever but it's all about the movie,0.09309786
right I saw the movie I got to talk about it right now to you,0.11200584
let's talk about this movie here's the thing about this review those be a little,0.089656755
bit different than what I usually do usually I'm like here's good bad very and,0.23972712
here's some clips and here's some plot point if any other mm-hmm I don't do,0.07968268
any of that I won't going to keep this as as big and simplified while,0.15048292
still giving you my thoughts and what I possibly can and the reason for that,0.09520226
is I don't want to spoil this in any kind of way I think this,0.10553492
is one of those movies that you got to go in knowing probably as little,0.08466527
as you possibly can to really fully experience and enjoy it so this is it,0.08908432
this photo you see back here that's all I get all right I'll put the,0.103541456
the logo of the title of the movie boom get out that's it only thing,0.07549162
you need to know about the plot is that there's a couple Chris Andros Chris,0.06184762
happens to be black Rose happens to be white they're going home to the countryside,0.44323176
to our Paris house to meet her family obviously her family is white he's is,0.49177414
black guy in a different location with all these family members and something's happens some,0.4679342
of its suspenseful some of its horror some of his race-related so it is a,0.3094017
blend of all of it but that's all you need to know so uh yeah,0.16585365
man I really enjoyed this movie I am NOT a huge horror person like I,0.3829522
don't really go see a lot of horror movies in theaters and lately some of,0.13447803
the horror films have kind of followed a similar formula that just come in to,0.09710489
go and so it was nice to go see this one and really get into,0.09237076
it and what's interesting about this movie is it's or suspense then hearth it reminds,0.077576086
me a lot of 10 Cloverfield Lane not necessarily in the actual premise but just,0.023518896
in the feeling of it which with another movie that was much more enjoyable not,0.061215274
knowing anything going into it as opposed to being told a lot about it before,0.08044387
going in I saw 10 Cloverfield Lane like the weekend it open mainly because I,0.05606141
didn't want anything spoiled about it and really enjoyed it as a result and the,0.12215092
same way I feel about this one but as far as there are similarities as,0.05357082
far as feelings yeah man that that feeling of just suspense of like everyone's acting,0.11524265
normal but they're a little off and I know that there's something underneath that's going,0.18166003
down but I can't figure out what yet the movie is not coming yet but,0.054144498
I know everything ain't right or when someone goes from one move to another move,0.064021535
really quickly for whatever reason like this gave me some flashbacks of watching 10 Cloverfield,0.105297655
Lane and just how the suspense was with this movie the whole time I watch,0.087780066
this movie I'm just like this like usually when you're watching a movie and you,0.11337841
like having fun like a Lego Batman or a comedy or something that you can,0.24488272
like sit back you lean back get Sharleen back gets popcorn you just like rule,0.14903928
is I'm having a great time movie time just relaxing you know if you don't,0.09290445
have anybody in those in the seat in front of you you might even get,0.19022635
a little like home body and I ain't got no manners to speed up you,0.15418687
know how it is but what this movie man I was like this the whole,0.13543342
time like and air any sound like not even like jump jump scare type sound,0.28866547
like just you know up walk like you hear like a twig getting cut from,0.40734428
someone's foot touching the ground I'm like what that was that wasn't what's going on,0.17744648
that's kind of how I felt watching this things about this is so suspenseful and,0.105525345
it's just one of those movies where you're just like you don't know what's going,0.23411198
to happen or how people are going to act in this and and it's just,0.093788326
the tension is just so deep and I felt that the entire time watching this,0.07465243
thing so that's one thing you're reminding me live how I felt when I was,0.09912189
watching 10 Cloverfield Lane like man John Goodman is helping me a little winters it,0.11740067
out but at the same time King y'all there I got a got to live,0.14076433
off this like this family they seem cool then you know the making food and,0.114538886
everything seemed right was hell me right I know something right and then when you,0.41158056
start meeting the people that's helping them network at the place and you know and,0.06767812
of course like that's what a report comes in cuz they're all black you just,0.6375198
like something about them either you know this dude going in here and either like,0.114858106
a really black people working here I think I could be cool with it but,0.44245046
then you meet them you Amy they were everyone weird why oh man isn't it,0.22972676
um so I really like that bad I really really appreciated that that style of,0.1377622
suspense with this movie you just don't know what's going on but you know something,0.24038957
they are right and then what adds the extra element to that is the stuff,0.03972852
about race now I'm guessing that this may be the type of movie that is,0.10768497
going to work for different people in different ways depending on what your background is,0.05543671
so I can only explain it for myself but as a black man particularly one,0.60512435
who has been in situations at times where I've been surrounded by all white people,0.49252477
on their element in this movie that I kind of relate it to a couple,0.054325216
of times I was like I know this is fictional and I know this is,0.060785282
a suspense and I know that there is something extra to this movie that has,0.07357077
nothing to do with with real life because it's a fantasy you know situation but,0.12770782
the thing that's happening here I can relate that to actual things that happened to,0.024506455
me I realized there's a without giving away too much there's a party scene that,0.10200319
happens in this movie and it's very much related to the movie but I have,0.06191881
been to a bit I have been to parties and I have been in conversations,0.07720104
particularly in LA that I was like I know that situation I've been there I,0.07113614
can literally like take myself out of my seat take myself in the movie theater,0.16891661
and go I have been in that situation are you are you focusing on some,0.14374278
pleasures my cameras aren't focusing on on the screen as opposed to on me not,0.08817292
this black faces black face cameras make a decision anyway so yeah Matt you you,0.6364068
you can't help but notice at least for me I couldn't I hope but add,0.08735675
that extra tension to the movie so you've already got the suspenseful stuff going on,0.14869659
and then you add the tension of race on top of that and it's not,0.21971059
even so much blatant stuff it's just just situation it's just the situation and that's,0.07916687
why I was saying I think it's going to work different for different people because,0.096115306
it was a situation that I could relate to based on my life experience and,0.060329318
based on experiences of others I know who've been in some situations it's like I,0.08133836
I could just feel an extra level of attention that I don't know other people,0.09644962
will feel but I felt it I felt about the entire movie man and it,0.15216784
was it was intense man the other reason why I would compare this movie to,0.117037065
10 Cloverfield Lane is because like that movie there's a lot of times you're going,0.08788982
to want to pay close attention to just everything in the movie you want to,0.09538191
pay attention to things people say things people do certain lines of dialogue certain objects,0.14697108
certain things you just want to keep tabs because there's going to be things you,0.09174924
know what was that all about and then when that all the pieces start getting,0.077384934
put in the place you be like oh now I see why this person said,0.13056186
this or this person did that it's like it will all sort of come together,0.1686415
gets all scooby-doo mystery on you like God says Velma comes out and says I,0.16320944
mean the reason why this thing happened is because of this and now you understand,0.11626415
jinkies you know I get it get to that moment um so that that's really,0.15963249
cool too because I think it's going to be one of those types of films,0.15087347
where if you watch it the first time I only watched it once but I,0.08522236
feel like if I were watching a second time there were things that probably just,0.049658384
kind of look like oh that's the thing but I'm now watching and go oh,0.07336787
okay I see what you did there Jordan Peele you crappy dude so uh so,0.6446678
that that's that's really neat um you know are there any issues with the movie,0.062037766
you know it it after a while you start to start put the pieces together,0.20951805
yourself it starts to get a little predictable it isn't Blum House production so some,0.121046275
of the element are Blum house II but at the same time I know that,0.03886507
Blum house kind of had this period of just trying to make every movie cheap,0.13104023
and like paranormal activity or whatever but you can tell that you know even though,0.09914971
this is a bottle film it only takes place in a couple locations you can,0.18438219
tell that there was definitely some work into how it shot into the performances the,0.17205936
performances are great everyone plays it on this subtle level to where you again you're,0.06832276
like questioning like wait are you saying this because that's just how you are as,0.15323323
a person or are you saying this because there's something going on that I'm not,0.09208082
noticing here so like they're really good at that the music is always this kind,0.15910663
of like violin sounding or just kind of creepy sounding that makes things more intense,0.15159035
it shot beautifully it's performed great a lot of people play it very subtle there,0.1716742
are a couple of characters that are a little bit more so not so subtle,0.18717903
uh but that's okay because they either makes them really creepy or really hilarious so,0.16089672
either way you're fine there's an actor in here in a little realm he's a,0.088665314
comedian and he's great he basically without again without saying too much but but if,0.07478855
you are a person that constantly goes to horror movie then you're one of the,0.31089434
people who's like why are you doing this why you doing that don't go in,0.17962779
there don't do that that's basically his character in this movie ah you can kind,0.13872315
of relate to his character in that same kind of way so so yeah man,0.052378777
oh man it I just I really really like this movie I just very much,0.118004136
enjoyed it and I think it's very interesting to see a horror slash suspense film,0.20018056
use the subject of race as a way to add more horror add more suspense,0.25036675
to something that is fictionalized but yet you can still connect it to things in,0.057521664
life which that's how it is with pretty much any drama you look at like,0.19033356
sci-fi or even comedies or action even though it's a fictionalized fantasy version of what's,0.112666965
going on the screen you can always kind of relate it related to real world,0.04175316
things and that's what happens with this I mean I don't think it's a preachy,0.09138008
movie I think it's just a movie that uses a subject of race who is,0.13989323
advantage to tell a story so if anyone's going is going was it is it,0.07056586
Reese's I don't know no you know what grow a pair I'm sorry it's all,0.11463636
right boohoo a movie about suspension car use the subject of race to help get,0.099403426
mrs. Benson car oh man went away you know like deal with it okay because,0.112632275
that's what the movie is and that's what made it intriguing to me when I,0.056373138
first saw that trailer for I was like I got to see that you know,0.07762436
I didn't do a reaction video because I wasn't really doing reactions of trailers at,0.068529986
the time but mark my words when it came out at this time period I,0.08910144
would have done but anyway uh yeah man I knew for a fact that I,0.10661973
want to see what was going on here and now thing I really think it's,0.094608806
really good and particularly for it coming from Jordan Peele who is a person that,0.08855715
you know is known for comedy known for key and Peele and bad TV and,0.15175188
sketch comedy and things like that to see him on the other side being a,0.15249549
writer being a director I mean obviously he had a lot of great work doing,0.11794532
this in comedy like cameo you know I was thinking they were writing the sketches,0.19103006
everything but to see him take that talent into another genre was really cool and,0.09476491
I thought was very effective I mean you know I I just I really was,0.05575509
intrigued by this movie and that's really all I want to say about it I'm,0.11042844
not going in any more detail more than that all I'm saying is if you,0.11284045
like horror films if you like suspense film and you are whipping a be about,0.31089434
race being mentioned in the movie then get out for you for the schedule Barry,0.1669422
okay two kids see Batman and speak on over to the other theater and seek,0.13016921
it out uh yeah man I just I like this movie I really really enjoyed,0.18818629
it like I saw this screening but I actually want to go see it again,0.061122287
I'm going to Newark on this weekend so I don't if I get to see,0.09941641
it again this weekend but I do want to see it again that's a phone,0.05405244
get out I want to see the movie again just because I'd be intrigued to,0.08293913
see if I catch anything the second time around I'm watching it again so there,0.0686205
