"family is found dead, the private detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, is hired",0.30064684
to solve the mystery. Thereís just something so satisfying about a well-crafted mystery. Whodunit films,0.11650684
are kind of a thing of the past. Weíve been having a mini resurgence the,0.07588816
"last few years, but classic murder mysteries donít really flood the theaters like they did",0.18724382

"screen with an all-star ensemble cast was an exciting one. And Knives Out really delivers,",0.06621586
providing us with a classic tale of mystery while maintaining certain more modern filmmaking sensibilities.,0.037724484
"I feel like Iíve been invoking Agatha Christie a lot in my reviews lately, but",0.08661309
thereís no way around it here. Not only is she the best-selling novelist of all,0.13573131
"time, but sheís arguably the best mystery writer of all time too. And as such,",0.06854583
her influence on modern storytelling is as wide-reaching as it is significant. Knives Out is,0.08201144
like an amalgamation of her greatest hits. Youíve got that classic murder mystery scenario involving,0.31089434
a large group of people in a mansion thatís straight out of And Then There,0.22760037
"Were None. But unlike that story, itís not up to the house guests to solve",0.06604164
the crime. Weíve got a detective this time around which only further connects this particular,0.15584522
"film to the works of Agatha Christie. How you ask? Well, this filmís Benoit Blanc",0.1636347
"character is clearly influenced by Christieís own long-running detective character: Hercule Poirot, with both strongly-accented",0.070692234
"men proceeding with their investigations in peculiar ways, picking up on minute details and being",0.07989163
rather prone to exposition-heavy explanations. While these mystery genre callbacks might not be immediately recognizable,0.13601163

"no surprise that not every character is gonna have the same amount of screentime. But,",0.08970735
there were certain characters that I expected would have a larger role than they ended,0.06008592
up having. Thatís not a bad thing though. Not only did it allow for more,0.081316315
"focus on Benoit Blanc and his investigatory style, but it also prevented the suspect characters",0.1161557
from every getting too unlikeable. The family at the center of this mystery is a,0.43856734
diverse and eccentric bunch. Theyíre also the epitome of a dysfunctional family. They constantly argue,0.24211766
"and yell at each other, seemingly exclusively speaking in (at most) half-truths, and have zero",0.15010695
qualms about throwing each other under the bus. This interplay provides us ñ and Blanc-,0.18053553
with some valuable insight into the motives and personalities of the suspects and it was,0.06689343
"mostly played for humor, though admittedly it didnít always work for me. Mean-spirited familial interplay",0.2760866
"is never all that funny to me, though a lot of people in my theater",0.1521008
"were cracking up at it, so itís definitely just a weird personal preference of mine.",0.0995772
"So, while the family humor just wasnít there for me, that doesnít mean this wasnít",0.12256449
"a funny movie. For me, the most humorous bits all came from the two major",0.10208883
"characters that werenít members of the Thrombey family: Marta and, of course, Benoit Blanc. They",0.08177866
each had some very entertaining interactions with one another as well as the rest of,0.13317534
"the pool of suspects, resulting in a consistently humorous film with some great dialogue. Blanc",0.068676
was an especially entertaining character and Daniel Craig did a wonderful job portraying him. He,0.06806978
"once again breaks out the southern accent and I have to say, it still throws",0.11111097
"me off, even after having seen Logan Lucky. Luckily, the oddity of the accent is",0.056861103
"short-lived and itís easy to buy into his character, especially with all the strange things",0.09279922
happening around him. Part of the fun of a whodunit film is to try to,0.15167518
solve the mystery before the characters do. The trailer was pretty enigmatic when it came,0.040654834
"to the murder mystery, but I had a theory in mind before even heading into",0.22674285
"the theater. Although my guess wasnít correct, I was pleased to see that at least",0.101835065
certain elements of it were. Itís always fun to be surprised by a movie like,0.12370745
"this one and it succeeded, not only with regard to the solution to the murder",0.4925828
"mystery, but also with its structure. What starts off as an entertaining, but fairly typical",0.075944506
"whodunit story, transforms into something more clever after some revelations that are made at the",0.14584914
end of the first act. Donít let that disappoint you though ñ thereís still plenty,0.20679355
"to enjoy about the movie after that, plus a few turns you wonít expect. Even",0.08955775
"with its more modern take and comedy-centric stylings, I think this would be a mystery",0.11664299
that even Agatha Christie wouldíve enjoyed. Alright letís talk about the pros and cons. Pro,0.13631071
number one is definitely Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc. The character is certainly modeled after,0.05013112
"Hercule Poirot, but Craig brings enough charm and humor to the role to set him",0.07343674
apart. Well-crafted mysteries are no good if you donít have a character that can solve,0.10312273
"them and Blanc does just that in an interesting and frequently humorous way. In fact,",0.062316414
nearly all the moments in this film that I found to be the funniest involved,0.08385731
"Blanc and his interactions with other character. His methodical, yet odd way of approaching the",0.14263742
mystery definitely created a lot of friction with the other characters and produced some really,0.056803904
"good reactions, not to mention some incredibly funny dialogue. Blanc may end up being described",0.0640169
"as the southern Poirot, but just like Christieís famed detective, I would love to see",0.099016964
him return to solve another mystery. The second pro is the whodunit plot itself. Iím,0.13955775
a big fan of mystery stories and some of my favorite movies have mystery components,0.025811043
to them. But having a good idea for a mystery doesnít necessarily equate to having,0.08913498
a well-executed mystery film. I would argue that itís one of the most difficult genres,0.18548052
to tackle cause not only does every piece have to fall into place in a,0.10520231
"way that actually makes sense, but you need to keep your audience invested the whole",0.053548556
"time. That means that they need to care about the story, but they also need",0.0227201
to feel like theyíre right on the cusp of solving the mystery too. Too simple,0.060334112
"and theyíll be bored, but too convoluted and theyíll get frustrated. Itís a difficult balance,",0.15351017
but Knives Out does an excellent job of both intriguing and entertaining the audience with,0.0525329
"a well-crafted mystery that Agatha Christie would be proud of. On the con side, my",0.112912595
"biggest issue was the family interplay. This is definitely more of a subjective thing, but",0.050531663
I just donít find fighting families to be particularly funny. Of course there was a,0.113213405
"bit of humor stemming from the family dynamics for me, but I have a hard",0.08101452
time finding such utterly unlikable characters enjoyable. Iíll concede that these arguments gave us some,0.31089434
good insight and clues with regard to the murder mystery at the center of the,0.15295456
"film, but it was still the least enjoyable aspect of the movie for me. Iím",0.09003023
gonna give Knives Out 4 out of 5 paws. Itís a darkly entertaining whodunit with,0.11300563
"a surprising structure, a stand-out cast, and more Agatha Christie homages than you can shake",0.21509467
a candlestick at. I would recommend Knives Out to anybody whoís a fan of mystery,0.1404314
"films. If you like classic whodunit murder mysteries in the vein of Agatha Christie, then",0.33289465
"thereís gonna be a lot youíll like here, especially regarding the mystery itself and how",0.100558065
it gets unraveled. If you arenít familiar with the older mystery style or donít like,0.12016461
"how dry those films could sometimes be, then this should still be a movie for",0.11908108
you thanks to its witty dialogue and very entertaining plot and characters. If you liked,0.05942157
"Knives Out, Iíve gotta recommend And Then There Were None. This is one of Agatha",0.10609585
Christieís most iconic mysteries and definitely serves as a plot inspiration for this film. Like,0.094574094
"Knives Out, the story is centered around a murder that occurs in a mansion full",0.18623888
of people in which everybodyís a suspect. This is a whodunit story in the classic,0.16468161
"sense, so it doesnít have the degree of humor we see with Knives Out, but",0.0760268
"itís still a really solid mystery. If you like the idea of that basic premise,",0.067588694
"but want something a little more funny and outlandish, you should check out Clue. Itís",0.117346995
loosely based on the Clue board game and is essentially a comedic spoof of Agatha,0.12803201
Christieís And Then There Were None. And if you want another murder mystery story with,0.28040114
"an interesting detective character, I would check out Murder on the Orient Express. Both the",0.19139478
"1974 or the 2017 version would do, but based on this movie, Iíd probably lean",0.05912584
"more towards the 2017 remake for its humor. In either case, itís another Agatha Christie",0.08915977
"story, this time featuring her iconic detective character: Hercule Poirot, who served as a clear",0.0668823
"inspiration for Benoit Blanc. Alright, a couple questions for you guys. Number one: Have you",0.059974924
