unexpectedly my christopher nolan ranking is already out so some of you already know my,0.15788868
thoughts on this film uh i actually reviewed dunkirk whenever it first came out in,0.16327217
theaters but it was in the middle of me moving so i was moving from,0.07386588
my apartment to the house that i'm currently renting and you can watch this video,0.10357937
and i look back on it and i'm like why did i do this i,0.07865003
did it live from my phone in the middle of my house that was just,0.072325006
kind of being filled with boxes with a dunkirk image in the back of my,0.16834706
tv and the lighting is absolutely terrible i basically look like one of those shadow,0.24420711
figures on like america's most wanted video or he didn't want to disclose his identity,0.10584491
and just sit there yes sorry i was one of the witnesses during the uh,0.060477957
it's horrible it's a terrible review i i almost wish that i could just delete,0.24133503
it but i like looking back at some of my past mistakes i have a,0.0509884
few people that i know who agree with me as far as there's not been,0.082497194
any characters or any character development or anything like that the movie purposefully does that,0.054918066
it makes the characters really minimalistic it's just supposed to allow you with kind of,0.12312368
the visuals and you're supposed to kind of be focusing on what's on screen not,0.07785727
necessarily getting into the back stories and the inner workings and the morals of all,0.06551758
these different people but this is a movie at the end of the day you,0.18677184
have to have some of that i'm glad that i actually get to give this,0.0838302
movie a proper review unfortunately my thoughts really have not changed from that first review,0.09817787
so i would have loved to have come back and said hey you know what,0.0735186
time heals all wounds i was obviously tired when i saw it the first time,0.10233054
and now i watch it again and it's a totally different experience had that experience,0.04449505
with a few of nolan movies but to let the cat out of the bag,0.13582496
i'm just not a fan of dunkirk it's just not a movie for me but,0.1508595
with that being said let's get the positives out first and look despite the fact,0.1039192
that i'm not really a big fan of it and don't really particularly enjoy it,0.10657044
i can recognize immediately that this movie is an absolute technical achievement like most nolan,0.16904381
movies the dude is a phenomenal director whether his story works for you or not,0.099375434
is fine but as far as the skills of a director how to move the,0.10675888
camera where to point the camera when to use cinematography and music and the score,0.06572929
which is really his biggest tools in this movie because he's really not focusing so,0.17222689
much on story or characters to build up the tension and to give the experience,0.052765172
of this dunkirk evacuation he's relying on the cinematography and the score and just the,0.10906424
ambiance of war and it's all done masterfully if that was his mission he succeeded,0.24033323
in his mission and there are some very tense moments throughout this movie i mean,0.040747512
the entire story is like a ticking time bomb a clock ticking is a very,0.17062952
prominent piece of audio in this movie that's kind of woven into the score and,0.1007259
the score itself is kind of woven around the sound of a ticking clock because,0.08944992
these people are stuck they're surrounded by the germans death is imminent and you get,0.4333383
the land sea and air perspective of people trying to get these soldiers these allied,0.14018503
soldiers off of dunkirk and if you're into the story especially if you're a war,0.32944322
buff or if you just sit back and you're really captivated by this experience it,0.14101371
is a very tense story and whether or not i feel like he delivered that,0.047594443
story in a way that i would like to experience it the story itself that,0.039546426
they're going for here about this dunkirk evacuation is a very intriguing and interesting story,0.074905574
i'm not really a war person i'll get more into that but when i do,0.24010986
enjoy a war movie it's when they tell a really incredible story or they give,0.16285785
a really incredible character and their arc and you know that person story to kind,0.048442174
of draw me into that war setting and while i do feel that the story,0.11483859
kind of goes to the background in favor of the experience i do like the,0.054358527
story itself there's a pretty good performances here again it's not really a movie that's,0.056375537
going for acting you know prowess it's not a movie that's trying to give these,0.12524241
you know oscar level performances it's more so about the experience the ambience the setting,0.063382074
of war but you do get a lot of different characters in here even some,0.15606576
really top shelf actors like tom hardy is not really like the focus of the,0.11734855
movie he's not giving a performance or delivering a character that's going to be this,0.088411584
huge memorable thing on his career but for what they're required to do pretty much,0.094231635
every actor here does their job well with all that being said as far as,0.098819986
the negatives of this movie this is probably the most subjective review that i could,0.05024652
ever give almost to the point where i really don't even know how much insight,0.1869051
my thoughts on this movie are really going to add to the conversation because i've,0.06967797
said it before and i'm going to say it again i'm just not really a,0.08195242
war film person this is just not my genre i can count on one hand,0.34281576
how many war films i've watched and generally love and go back to re-watch and,0.20384082
there's so many of the quote-unquote greatest war films of all time that i've just,0.11156917
never really had the interest to watch there's so many of them that are still,0.08159524
on my movie bucket list and with dunkirk that kind of means that you're already,0.29149538
starting at a disadvantage with me because i'm just not really somebody that goes to,0.080583334
these movies if it wasn't christopher nolan's name at the top of this poster i,0.094526716
probably wouldn't have seen this movie period and following along with that for me personally,0.07030375
the choice to make the cinematography the sound the experience of war be the showcase,0.11571938
here and kind of push general typical storytelling and typical character arcs to the side,0.03388605
really didn't do any favors for me either i understand what they were going for,0.07512084
and like i said i if that was his mission he succeeded here that mission,0.058706824
just doesn't really appeal to me i'm not saying he failed i'm not saying that,0.10682104
this movie is terrible i'm not saying that he should have done it the other,0.3222595
way all i'm saying is the success of this movie just isn't a success for,0.058348484
me personally i'm somebody that prefers story and characters to be forefront it's very rare,0.087921105
that i can just survive off of experience alone and when it's an experience in,0.083733395
a subgenre that i'm not really that captivated by in the first place doesn't really,0.108765446
appeal to me doesn't really draw me in and it doesn't really do anything for,0.09753349
my emotions i'm not sitting there tense captivated amazed at what's going on i'm generally,0.10442928
bored throughout the entire movie i thought it was just because i was tired the,0.10262558
first time that i watched it that i was so bored i watched it this,0.06316063
time and i genuinely struggled to get through this movie it was to the point,0.05597685
where i looked at the runtime and i went thank christ that this is a,0.07629915
short christopher nolan movie because if this was like interstellar or tenets length i would,0.15034041
be crying right now and honestly that's really it it's just those two negatives but,0.15353467
there's such huge negatives for me and my experience that it really just kills this,0.44711095
movie for me it's just not my thing honestly i can understand i can respect,0.10289072
and i can totally recognize the genius of what is going on here and if,0.07740123
i love the war genre i would probably be there right with everybody else saying,0.23964033
that this is one of the best modern war films ever made but it just,0.10667208
doesn't do anything for me it bores the piss out of me and i have,0.46136692
absolutely zero interest in re-watching it and that is the only christopher nolan movie that,0.09578106
i can say that for so all in all guys i get it i understand,0.12603033
the mission here i understand the technical prowess of what is going on i understand,0.0930563
the genius of what is going on and i can appreciate all that i just,0.104101464
don't enjoy it i just it doesn't mind doesn't do anything for me i don't,0.11569058
know what else i can say i'm still going to get bitching down the comment,0.6364068
section i'm still going to get some trolls i'm still going to get a lot,0.40328088
of people that are like what the you like this but you don't like this,0.31089434
yeah i don't like this so if you're a fan of war movies this is,0.24097417
absolutely a must watch but if you are like me and just don't really have,0.15020701
a whole lot of interest in that genre i don't think there's going to be,0.057863384
much in this movie for you and unfortunately with my enjoyment and re-watch factor being,0.17912613
so low with this one i'm gonna have to recommend that you stream it so,0.1836632
