hello everybody and welcome back to robert's reviews before we get started i wanted to,0.016421389
announce that my niece is being a little too loud today so you might hear,0.039900377
her in the background so i apologize for that soon it will not matter because,0.10964089
i will be not living here so look forward to that i know i am,0.16342764
um but uh for those of you who don't know uh once again i am,0.112688094
in a film club at oneonta suny oneonta and uh so this is my last,0.035202183
review for them until next semester but uh they had me watch singing in the,0.023084532
rain [Applause] sand of the rain was released in 1952 which is a long time,0.008159143
ago it was written by betty condon and adolf green and directed by stanley donan,0.10124694
and gene kelly uh quick little quick little fun fact first of all this is,0.07546774
a non-spoiler review although it's singing in the rain you probably know it already um,0.019726021
i was in um i was in a production of singing in the rain uh,0.034414608
five years ago i played young cosmo so if you remember from the first scene,0.041896593
of the film when he when gene kelly and them are going up to the,0.023020675
premiere they have a little flashback sequence which shows don and uh don and cosmo,0.059104227
uh in their violin dance and stuff at vaudeville and stuff and i did that,0.066885546
for my production and i did a bunch of other stuff and stage crew and,0.053868566
was also like literally stage crew for the show um so it's a lot of,0.02553241
fun uh so i've seen the show dozens of times um because i wasn't on,0.075535595
stage too long for this one um but boy is it long it's it's not,0.047185466
long here it's it really isn't but it's long for the show on stage so,0.021852612
it's even longer so this felt like a nice little breezy dream in comparison to,0.115767896
the show but um essentially what happens is we're set in the world where there's,0.014377279
black and white movies and they're only there there's no sound right that's ridiculous why,0.27918398
we didn't have sound to a movie um and it's about the invention of the,0.01820408
sound that can go with the movies and basically what happens we have don lockwood,0.028267644
we have lena lamont and lena lamotte talks a lot like this right which sounds,0.0950747
ridiculous um and the issue is that they want to produce talkies right which are,0.11006727
movies that can talk which is normal for us now but not back then and,0.048560403
essentially what happens is they're freaking out because they can't have lena lamont in the,0.11979159
film because she's going to sound ridiculous right so what they do is they dub,0.3606932
the voice with somebody else kathy selden who is this young attractive lady that don,0.084836856
falls in love with and uh a lot of issues ensue particularly when liana lamont,0.06149024
finds out and she gets all mad and tries to stop it excuse me uh,0.1634589
but overall it's it's a fun little musical it really is and while it is,0.026208235
a good musical there are some issues i don't talk about one big issue right,0.017679252
now which was the long musical set says i stutter i apologize sequence at the,0.012339822
end of the film uh where we have this song it's like broadway rhythm i,0.037974004
think it's called um and boy is it long it was like literally like 20,0.02821576
minutes long and i'm sitting here like it has nothing at all to do with,0.12219357
the plot of the movie at all it really doesn't and it just kind of,0.023600716
felt weighed down by like oh well we already wrote the music so we got,0.0437458
to do it anyway so in another movie somehow and honestly it just it didn't,0.011843595
work very well i was prepared to give this a really good review and then,0.029822178
that scene and i just i i tried to let one scene ruin it but,0.11693197
it's a 20 minute scene like it's at least 10 minutes i might be over,0.043040708
exaggerating like it's 20 but it's at least like 10 minutes long and i'm like,0.041005246
we didn't need it and the music wasn't that good either that's another thing i,0.030324392
do want to talk about i don't really care for the music very much here,0.043465097
there's sometimes i love like make them laugh it's on my favorite songs or any,0.042253796
musical um and i do like good morning and singing in the rain is always,0.025347488
a good one but like the rest of it kind of felt meh and even,0.025684737
in the musical there's a lot of extra stuff like um what's wrong with me,0.033648316
which little lamont sings and a bunch of like that that i really enjoyed that,0.08168588
wasn't in the film um which is good because the film was pushing with that,0.0136203
20 minute long dance sequence i had nothing to do with the plot of the,0.023675881
film at all um but the acting was really strong here that's like one thing,0.04001279
that i really did like about the show was it is very well acted i'm,0.03820549
very impressed with with gene kelly here and of course um uh debbie reynolds and,0.04262763
gene hagen and donald o'connor all of them are great so let's go ahead and,0.40418485
start talking about them because i think they're definitely the the attraction that brings people,0.029436372
to see this movie gene kelly as don lockwood i've heard working with him is,0.08664749
is the worst thing you could ever do in your life um but to his,0.16015893
credit he's very good he really is um he's really good at singing but his,0.029304
acting in particular is really really strong he plays this kind of an arrogant actor,0.18651684
who has started to realize that you know acting is kind of weird anyways maybe,0.049993206
maybe i shouldn't be as arrogant as i have been and like all that fun,0.2188707
jazz that ensues in the movie really just it was great i i did like,0.040465117
his portrayal in this movie uh and i haven't seen any of them i think,0.12649997
but maybe i'll look into looking at some other stuff maybe down the line we'll,0.033820596
do a you know a series of him i mean it is the 50s so,0.032748323
it was a long time ago but uh i do need to catch up on,0.042878404
some old film noir stuff donald o'connor as cosmo brown cosmos my favorite character i,0.039160028
am a little biased because i was young cosmo in the show but he's also,0.054994058
like he's really funny and he has that that make him laugh sequence that i,0.042932946
really like um it really is great he like broke his ankle or something doing,0.115870334
that and he had to do it like three times and he was he didn't,0.017472379
like it but he did it anyway because he was supposed to and honestly it,0.03302437
was really fun and i'm really happy they did the way they did it my,0.030627051
goal in life one day is to one day recreate that sequence um that'd be,0.03763875
a lot of fun like the exact sequence i think that'd be really really fun,0.032172274
debbie reynolds as kathy selden kathy selden is the young attractive girl that don falls,0.08831577
in love with and she can sing and she can act and all that stuff,0.050629124
but she's not on the big screen because she kind of thinks it's dumb but,0.3155283
then she realizes oh it might actually be fun to do that so that she,0.068717465
does and that's really the romantic part of the movie and i liked it i,0.04414957
think it was good i think it was a good issue to have right where,0.03436605
don likes kathy but kathy doesn't really like dawn too much or at least she's,0.063010186
not letting on that she does and it works here because it's like one of,0.04876794
the first times that it ever happened right because you watch movies now and it's,0.035577346
like oh that's like every day but like this is like the first time like,0.034890212
it's one of the first times it's the 50s um but it worked well it,0.027081622
was it was a good excuse to have romance and i hate bad excuses from,0.09830084
that's like oh well it's a movie so it's gotta have a bunch of romance,0.052671902
in it right not necessarily it doesn't have to i got this director's chair okay,0.043567535
that's pretty cool um but like it's interesting that they did that because it was,0.02471889
like the first time like that's like basically an original idea right there think it,0.02548252
was really well done and i did like it quite a bit and we have,0.03810571
jean hagen as lena lamont lean on the monster great i hate her with a,0.68095
passion don't get me wrong i hate her with a passion she's annoying as hell,0.63036156
to listen to she's like ow but donny you're in love and it's like oh,0.06580928
my god please he doesn't like you but she was great i really that's the,0.09224434
point of her characters to hate her so well done overall i think it's a,0.28144753
really really good movie i really do i think it's fun and it's it's it's,0.07184183
a good movie to watch and to pay attention to um for at least the,0.0126670925
hour and 20 minutes and then of course it's like oh but here's a really,0.032141007
long dance number you get to listen to hee hee and it's like you just,0.08334019
could have not had that and it would have been great and i do have,0.031497777
some issues with directing we're not going to talk about it because it's it's hard,0.050023805
to pinpoint what is directing what is acting at this point um and especially considering,0.021865252
gene kelly did both of them uh but there were just some issues that i'd,0.13299748
like all right take for example the singing of the rain dance that was really,0.023626657
well done right really really good and they had other things that just felt way,0.024156144
too structured right saying the rain felt like loose and gene kelly could just like,0.028494472
run around and dance and do awesome stuff with dance involved and then do other,0.035534777
things like say the good morning sequence which felt a little too over the top,0.023704484
for me even though it's a good song it's a little too over the top,0.026848808
for me um and of course the 20 minute long dancing because in the movie,0.018951748
which is so freaking long it's unbelievable um i can't express my hatred for that,0.25844872
sequence enough i was sitting here on my bed like watching this movie at like,0.13101324
10 at night and i'm like oh my goodness i just want to go to,0.022306269
sleep now like i was totally engaged in the movie and they're like oh but,0.08240029
this and i was like why um so that happened but overall a really really,0.03331373
fun movie if you guys want to give it a shot and take it take,0.22099529
a watch it's in it's on hbo max um and just be wary that towards,0.032275375
the end of the film it doesn't get a whole lot better the ending is,0.02348963
really fun i do like the ending after the sequence is really good um but,0.05556412
the sequence itself is not very good um but i'm gonna go ahead and give,0.06573744
singing in the rain an a minus really really fun movie it's a really old,0.08673196
