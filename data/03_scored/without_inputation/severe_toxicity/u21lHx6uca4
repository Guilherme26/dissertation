Austin which is where I'm still at right now it doesn't end until this weekend,0.053738855
and so first and foremost that when I was pets Jordan I went outside in,0.024166122
the hot Sun I was sweating in places I didn't know that I could sweat,0.12140333
in just to see this movie and I'm happy to say that it was actually,0.04303339
worth it and hopefully I lost a couple of pounds in the process of being,0.041993707
a high at sweating outside um so first and foremost is film centers around this,0.014463088
family who's basically going on a vacation they're chilling at their little summer vacation home,0.027260557
I say who had a summer vacation cause I sure as hell did it but,0.10031967
they're on their way to vacation everything seems to be going well everyone's having a,0.01878279
great time I'm having a great time watching them have a great time until they,0.044206776
are confronted by the evil doppelganger versions of themselves and then you know what it's,0.052442413
just hits the fan after that and then I was taking on the Sterling and,0.13845465
suspenseful ride that I was just like whoo I was screaming I was jumping always,0.071158685
be screaming and jumping people's looking to be crazy in the movie I was like,0.1882962
yeah this is actually scary I don't understand what you're watching but I know what,0.02422865
I'm watching right now but I have to say I really did enjoy this film,0.07026401
one of the main things that I loved about this film was how they were,0.03859196
able to balance the use of suspense and there's even a little bit of blood,0.19745778
and gore in this film as well kind of with the comedy there's actually a,0.039091513
lot of comedy in this film I'm mainly given by Winston Dukes character but I,0.03479642
was just like wow this is kind of like a dark comedy and I'm actually,0.048750643
loving the vibe because I feel as though the comedy hit in the best parts,0.15385698
it didn't take away from you still being scared and didn't take away from the,0.02749603
suspense that the film was giving I just thought that everything was so well balanced,0.027723525
and I have to say can we go ahead and put Dukan a romantic comedy,0.076481484
because after watching him at us I was just like he can definitely pull this,0.026680516
off and I am so here for it and thank you listen dupe for letting,0.12172861
people know that thick thighs matter because they do yeah also too Lupita yeah Lupita,0.19885997
did the damn thing I was just like girl so you gonna sort of parent,0.64677966
give us this little oscar-worthy performance like this plan these two characters which I have,0.06377382
to give kudos to the entire cast for doing so because they're not only just,0.038206153
playing kind of this the regular versions of themselves they also do a very great,0.040860903
job of showing the distinct difference between who their evil doppelganger is versus to the,0.08662753
characters that we were introduced to in the beginning of the film I thought it,0.012314545
was very well done and kudos to everyone but Lupita Lupita is the one who,0.020800957
took it all the way home she knocked it out of the park I was,0.14293067
like yes girl yes I was here for everything that she was possibly in so,0.06834895
also - I do appreciate that this is a different tone a film than what,0.03062306
we were used to and get out and I really do feel as though I,0.04652494
have to make sure I've set the correct expectations for those who are watching the,0.008846942
film because I think it will help enhance your viewing experience this is not a,0.0319807
political movie as get out was this is not a racial movie as get out,0.13465844
was there are certain type of political things but not what you were thinking in,0.016149329
regards to race and get out was kind of more in-your-face as to what was,0.12122773
happening throughout the course of the film and I have to say that I appreciate,0.020827565
Jordan going into a different route now for those of you who might be for,0.04080037
those of you who might be more caught up or and get out I do,0.061290685
feel as though some people may feel as though get out was the better film,0.018869264
however because I love that he brings in more aspects of the horror the blood,0.12547094
the gore and then even to this underlying story of you know where are these,0.03128425
people coming from who are they you know trying to figure out what that plan,0.024071665
is I love how the movie makes you leave the theater continuously thinking okay and,0.04627616
if you thought that you had all these theories forget out you're definitely gonna have,0.049171705
a ton of theories as far as what US brings to the table and what,0.020635327
I will say is this is definitely a movie that you're not gonna get everything,0.10465002
the first time um I think I talked to someone from the studio who actually,0.028985377
saw the movie over six times they were just like there's something new that I,0.04718946
gathered from the film each time that I watch it so this is definitely going,0.030784698
to be a multiple repeat viewing I don't know if there's necessarily anything that I,0.019981451
didn't like more from a nitpicky standpoint will be more so I wanted to know,0.045440026
more about a certain subtype that was happening in the film and I didn't feel,0.023320008
as though all those questions were answered but I don't know if they were necessarily,0.026796257
supposed to be answer I think it was really supposed to make people leaving the,0.04315512
theater thinking like I wonder if this is what happened and so for that I,0.023519563
will have to say overall for us you gotta pay to see the film and,0.027064992
theater it's okay it gave me horn it gave me suspense it gave me last,0.14499474
it gave us great performances that would definitely keep you thinking from the time that,0.023214908
you sit you're a little behind in that movie till you walk out and probably,0.14642887
for the rest of the year because I guarantee there's gonna be some great series,0.009976424
popping up from this movie so those are pretty much my thoughts on us it's,0.07259415
