so I saw the Dunkirk movie this review I guess of this movie there's going,0.08299014
to be a lot of spoilers my friend there will be a lot the reason,0.10538406
I'm reviewing this I didn't expect to do this video at all the reason I'm,0.1137561
reviewing this is because this is my all-time favorite movie I was freaking shook us,0.44784993
to the core to the freaking core of the earth and myself shook by this,0.5616294
movie so uh the whole world seems to know that Harry Styles first movie is,0.06302312
Dunkirk so early on like last spring blast some time where I wasn't in school,0.085526556
that's all I remember I looked up Harry Styles while he was on his break,0.06570038
and I'm like oh interesting he's going to be in a movie not just like,0.1421807
I'm gonna see that movie you know when you're a directioner or you just like,0.24332063
Harry Styles or any of the members you just kind of want to like support,0.08226414
them and whatever they do hence the movie like a bunch of Directioners are going,0.2735993
to see the movie because you know it's like your baby you know yeah baby,0.4918301
kind of growing up and becoming his own oh man he's not even a baby,0.35649687
he older than me my friend I know it don't look like it but he,0.15297666
is and he's living his life and his see he's succeeding he's freaking finessing everything,0.5876557
so naturally I didn't know what the movie was there was no trailer there was,0.057980098
nothing much about it it was just like he's in a movie no I'm going,0.2040346
to see that so time passes and then I found out the movies called Dunkirk,0.101561785
I'm like oh great I'm going to buy tickets when it comes out didn't think,0.093864046
much about it was like supporting my man Harry Harold Edward Stiles that one and,0.09477915
so originally I was brought to it because of Harry I'm not going to lie,0.16138501
to you a few more like a little more time passed and I actually saw,0.09873544
the trailer yeah yeah I thought it wasn't even playing on it kind of hit,0.29408947
me by surprise those in the movie theater with my friends and it just is,0.086984165
like Dunkirk burnt you know like the trailer just did the trailer it just did,0.25286257
its thing and I was like oh god this is the one with Harry in,0.06708001
it too right uh-huh mm-hmm so we go this is going to hurt me more,0.3199515
in my feelings and I was a besting it too so it did basically more,0.06789254
came out more interviews more trailer time everything kind of it just became more and,0.11857086
it kind of built up and yes but mmm my god thing with war movies,0.2507716
is I personally they're probably one of my favorite movies and I'm like I suck,0.73385704
at history but I really like more movies for some reason the reason I don't,0.071248986
watch it that much it's because Tyra my bunny is on the floor if you,0.2483044
can hear that I apologize okay buzzing with me and more movies is that I,0.14969015
usually don't watch them just because they're kind of like emotionally kind of like okay,0.31089434
like why did we have war and I kind of get mad at the fact,0.28234825
that there's so much hate that we had to like fight with other countries like,0.18649262
there's so much bad stuff that we had to fight with each other so I,0.19572543
get really like saddened kind of by war movies so I just don't watch that,0.15454467
many but they're like my favorite type of movies which is weird I found out,0.08404148
that Christopher Nolan directed it honestly I haven't watched any movies from Christopher Nolan because,0.06608322
I have this gap of like not washing movies in my life and I don't,0.15204759
know why I haven't watched any of his previous movies as far as I know,0.082304604
that's going to change okay so I was sitting there was my friend and my,0.115606025
mom and my friend sister and we were watching the movie it starts right lights,0.103917755
went down movie begin oh my god it just started as already action like we,0.08626632
went straight into it they had the main character I don't think any of them,0.26601848
have names except for one or I wasn't paying attention if they actually did have,0.060510963
names but the main character we just starts off and he goes and he's in,0.0626947
with a group of people and then straight off the bat like they're just getting,0.5154597
shot they did they gone for the rest of the movie that's why I five,0.38762632
people got paid their five dollars and now they're good and they just great and,0.10495258
they're dying that was over so you already start with like boom action you're intrigued,0.15179358
he got your attention he Christopher Nolan yes he knows what he's doing he was,0.14421123
and some at territory I'm assuming that's why he was getting shot at him and,0.3076994
his group and he was like the only survivor he went with the French although,0.060715947
you know English and French allies they don't like each other so they were like,0.27962986
okay come here and go somewhere else like bye so he just went and he,0.13817915
found his other English people on the beach and they were all trying to get,0.30178562
out of Dunkirk on the way he was about to take a dump very good,0.4031494
touch on the movie because you just don't expect to see that in a movie,0.11930225
great um and well he didn't written same thing by the way and there was,0.07188984
a guy burying a body and he switched coats so he had the English coat,0.25262943
on but he wasn't English from England but we don't know at this point where,0.1398763
he's from um then the story continues they're trying to get out and basically Germany,0.10999252
just keeps like sudden bombs and killing a lot of people so they would just,0.69542736
have to go back on shore and just try to survive but they would send,0.055464927
more boats try to survive spend more boats try to survive and we have like,0.04832073
these three point of views right a little boat like a little vacation boat one,0.14180444
they just say on the sea usually was going out to Dunkirk so they can,0.06363514
bring some people back to England the second one was a pilot also going to,0.14952686
protect them from all all these planes that kept on shooting their ships so they,0.25325483
were sending the airport and so we had one of the characters it was three,0.03155891
planes they were going out there and then they had the other point of view,0.06747244
which is the one we started with is where they're already in Dunkirk and trying,0.0627815
to escape so they have a few scenes in the movie I'm not going to,0.07852275
like tell the whole story because you need to see the movie there's just like,0.064777635
a few scenes that really stuck out to me one was when they were like,0.09172733
really losing hope they just had a random guy we didn't know him or anything,0.14318286
he just went into the water and he just jumped in and drowned themselves like,0.44542667
he literally gave up hope and not only him but everybody they had the scene,0.27659878
where they had the boat coming out and it was leaving the port they were,0.06622738
leaving they had their bread they were kind of just like okay we just go,0.18628879
back to England and do whatever they need to do and they had I think,0.20395428
a torpedo that just hit a ship and there we go and the ship was,0.116781674
gone and in the room they were in it was like locked because that's just,0.10966995
how they were at the time and the guy that we didn't know that who's,0.10308713
not English was out while all the English soldiers are in there and he was,0.13128825
out just kind of like thinking about what he was doing and I think he,0.107505076
was just contemplating a lot of things and so he was outside of the ship,0.05896259
and they got hit and everybody was stuck in that room the ship starts like,0.11505652
tilting and they had water coming in and literally they were just drowning in this,0.34966838
room and so many were trying to unlock it but they were already like this,0.068353444
it was almost impossible and then the guy we don't know where he's from yet,0.08928122
opens it and then they all like come falling out and they go back to,0.110577516
shore and that it was such a freaking emotional like I can't describe it how,0.54997444
good of a seeing this was it was such an emotional scene and you just,0.112297125
felt it and you saw all these characters and everything oh like if my god,0.12758695
just saw like how helpless is basting then like they kept trying and then but,0.078518435
it just like stopped like I was brought to tears I'm almost crying four times,0.09944746
in this movie I don't want to tell I've never done like a movie review,0.09559203
I don't want to tell too much as a story it's just like it's such,0.092837214
a good story something I wanted to mention what they had since the very like,0.0537673
first scene this ticking it was ticking and ticking and ticking very subtle in the,0.06037848
background but it was happening the whole time that was telling you that just time,0.04748368
kept passing and rushing everything like everything needed to be done and it's just not,0.061545555
being done it's kind of like the ticking feel of what like what I was,0.057494763
feeling around the end of the movie they had actual like ships that came by,0.08737161
and they were back in England they were on the train and while he's boarding,0.1524107
the Train Harry's character Alex a butthole by the way there's um you'll see why,0.6556841
when you see the movie like you just you you're not meant to like his,0.38895646
character he's real tough and like you know you're just not supposed to like him,0.13993181
oh my god by Harry's acting it like this being his first movie it's just,0.07977983
weird tonight like usually don't notice when you see like a pop star going some,0.11195257
so this was like a whole different thing for me but like where did you,0.14541946
learn how to act there was a scene where I was just like so surprised,0.10092201
and this whole movie like I know I originally heard of it because of Harry,0.08607742
but I forgot Harry was in it like it was such a beautifully made movie,0.0671628
all the angles all the things in like the color grading was so great and,0.084930845
like beautiful and it just fits so well and you just felt every single character,0.08806324
and you felt every death and there were so many deaths and you just felt,0.4879571
all of it and how like you just felt the hope leaving and they had,0.08486806
something like panic scenes and like just you you're like stomach went into a not,0.24037798
like you didn't know how to feel and all you can do should sit there,0.10088398
and watch the movie and I think Christopher Nolan he's just a genius in the,0.13873024
way that he made this movie like I don't know how his brain even thought,0.5876557
of this like how did he make such a great movie I don't freaking have,0.32566902
a clue anyways they were brought back to England and s and they were getting,0.11647613
there's a guy handing out towels and he was looking down the whole time it,0.12696186
was ticking and was ticking his ticking everything it was like a very subtle tick,0.10364956
they had the main characters like the nice guy the guy you like and then,0.12902826
they had Alex so Alex was the first one walking into the train and the,0.060395174
guy was looking down and he was he said congrats and then Alex looked back,0.15064152
and he was like for what we only survived or something like that and it,0.09643387
was like that's enough and then I was just kept walking in the train and,0.05836557
then the main character he got his towel and then the guy was looking down,0.10923565
who's handing the towels and said that that's good that you like survived felt his,0.081060596
face meaning he was blind and then after when they were in the Train I've,0.06659932
said that dumb guy couldn't even look me in the eye to say congrats or,0.8606264
whatever and he was just you know like they need completely like two different things,0.071923465
and that's when the ticking stopped like as soon as he said that and that,0.07964071
like I don't know like I feel like I should know what that means but,0.06798058
I don't and this whole movie just kept me freakin alive guys I don't know,0.5860557
