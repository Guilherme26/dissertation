the shape of water is a love story set in the 1960s the lovers are a mute cleaning lady and an amphibian man who is a muscled torso but also scales and gills on paper it sounds preposterous on screen it is poetry Guillermo del Toro's film is fantastical gorgeous nutty and so moving that I wept del Toro has a frenzied fiercely original imagination his worlds are populated by magical creatures with a propensity for both great good and jaw-dropping evil but even the most awful are fully realized and utterly fascinating here that character is Colonel Richard Strickland a power-hungry sadistic government official played by Michael Shannon Strickland armed with an electric cattle prod enjoys torturing the creature who reciprocate Spy biting his fingers after that the creature who was found somewhere in the jungles of the Amazon is chained but not everyone is afraid of him Eliza who cleans up the blood that Colonel Strickland sheds sees the creatures beauty both are voiceless but they communicate through sign language and eggs he likes them citing science and national security the powers that be result of the creature must die but Eliza gets in the way she says or rather she signs all that I am all that I've ever been brought me here to him how far does this love story go all the way the lovemaking between Eliza and her Merman is a thing of staggering beauty the shape of water is a celebration of marginalized voiceless people and a fluidity cinematographer Dan Lofton captures this with beautifully lit shots of a bathtub rain a lagoon and even the creatures watery prison the visuals and colors enhance the fairytale nature of the story but the rich emotions grounded the acting is superb especially the oscar-nominated Sally Hawkins who is the beating heart of the film her love for her Merman is sweet tender and unforgettable I also enjoyed the wonderful Richard Jenkins Octavia Spencer and Michael Stuhlbarg who plays a Russian spy and of course Shannon who's Colonel Strickland is a villain so contorted and torture himself that you all post want to help with a hug and therapy the shape of water is obviously inspired by Creature from the Black Lagoon also a story set during the Cold War of a half-man half-fish creature but del Toro gives the camp classic an entirely new spin imbuing the idea with layers of wisdom in an interview with Collider del Toro who is Mexican spoke about how Catholicism and the old religion of Mexico fused when the country was conquered he said in my case that happened with Catholicism and monsters they fused I truly was redeemed by these figures where other people saw horror I saw beauty and where people saw normalcy I saw Hollow I realized that true monsters are in the human heart the shape of water is visionary filmmaking I'm going with four stars for more reviews like this subscribe to film companion [Music] you
