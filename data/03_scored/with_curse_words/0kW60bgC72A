oh my the liberties taken with the Marvel Thor mythology I was very surprised but,0.0687417
I guess when you've made over 12 billion at the box office this Kevin Feige,0.1513904
has done wow that's quite a that's quite a feat he's a Hollywood superhero you,0.10689878
can do whatever you want and it does saddened me to some degree to see,0.11161315
the comics become the cart rather than the horse when it comes to these characters,0.091045424
but that said I did feel it many times while I was watching this movie,0.05909863
from the very opening scene that I was reading not just a Thor comic but,0.050341748
a very good Thor comic and while Warner Brothers is trying to learn Taika Waititi,0.10580289
away as we speak for a live-action akira which I totally get by the way,0.1490882
many times during the film when I didn't feel like I was reading a Thor,0.041179013
comic well just really on the planets a car basically but for the four fleeting,0.057197258
moments I was like a live-action Akira oh there it is again I mean he's,0.10523509
kind of in some ways already done the groundwork for it but I would really,0.06738618
like to see Tyco with TD stick with Thor as I think he'd do a,0.08075922
fabulous job exploring the nine realms and all its fantastical elements like frost giants light,0.060865667
and dark elves etc I already said oh my when I opened this review but,0.1619294
if you're reading the current Jason Aaron run on thor ragnarok with rustled ottomans artwork,0.10280322
shout out to wrestle daughter min the artist on my my own comic super via,0.2368097
but I think Taika Waititi would do a fabulous job bringing that that very colorful,0.08982641
fantasy stuff to the big screen which is kind of to some degree what he's,0.12009135
done here now this is a non-spoiler review and I was again genuinely surprised a,0.044935152
handful of times while watching the movie and I think that it was a mistake,0.09872678
for Disney Marvel to release this film across the globe and what's essentially a two-week,0.075776905
rollout that's such a slow rollout because I feel that without the surprises this film,0.21708174
is going to seem weaker than it is and the surprises are too big too,0.11618196
important too well I think that what's really without giving them away what's really a,0.07208207
big deal about them is what they're going to impact there gonna have on the,0.0716544
MCU going forward so there's no way that you're gonna be able to avoid them,0.11842241
I mean good luck to you but it's just not gonna happen I mean I,0.15293968
already went in as early as I did knowing some stuff particularly about the end,0.072683424
credits sequences which you know really are known on and credit sequences and I would,0.05862729
I wish that I had not known even that and it did lessen the impact,0.07948331
for me so good luck to you and Marvel Marvel and Disney really shouldn't have,0.11946972
put you in that position now why would thor ragnarok seem weaker without it surprises,0.14912269
well that's because Taika Waititi is still growing as a filmmaker what have you correctly,0.10553873
interpreted my emoji pre-review right when i got out of the theater and that's the,0.06450788
thor ragnarok is a colorful funny party with good music it's like the first guardians,0.085796304
of the galaxy and I'm very specific with that distinction the first over the second,0.07396528
and I'll explain that in just a moment but the very first trailer for Thor,0.05462968
Ragnarok which rocked the world made the movie seemed a little grander a little more,0.08511337
epic a little more revolutionary than it actually is I mean when Kevin Feige said,0.10756221
he was gonna take more cues from James Gunn I had no idea that meant,0.09747008
he was basically gonna duplicate James Gunn and if Taika Waititi is indeed following in,0.13857125
James Gunn's footsteps and that means there's a knock out emotional moment like with yondu,0.10134298
and volume 2 on the horizon for him but it's not in this movie there,0.0576366
is a difference by the way I want to clarify between James Gunn and Tycho,0.07936753
with TT James Gunn is more lowbrow frat boy humor whereas Tycho with TD is,0.35632616
more quirky highbrow humor which I prefer so that's why I like this I like,0.09664755
this much better than the first guardians of the galaxy although that was a huge,0.058221105
hit so I'd be curious to see how this one comes across now again this,0.21784218
is a colorful party with good music and I wore this shirt by the way,0.082365125
intentionally for this review because I feel this is this would fit in with the,0.07456741
movie very well right it's a big bright loud pig shirt that's fun to wear,0.3606548
but I would like to add to that description cuz the more I thought about,0.06082339
it what I'd like to add to that is it is a colorful fun funny,0.06643244
party with good music and good friends that's a really important distinction that is something,0.034284186
I did not expect in the film that was a really pleasant surprise and that's,0.05315551
the camaraderie I mean we're sixteen movies and a decade and at this point when,0.075662754
it comes to the MCU Wow and the tremendous payoff there which I only notice,0.06969204
with this movie Taika Waititi is the first to do something with it and that,0.09896999
is the depth of the relationships that have developed between these characters the shorthand that,0.036792975
has developed what they still don't know each about each other which is very telling,0.08563062
and also their relationships with us all of those things seem very real in this,0.08189443
movie for instance they're some of the quieter moments in the movie particularly when Thor,0.070335135
and banner catch up really you know that was the closest this movie came to,0.053012747
kind of like emotionally hitting me and the more I let it wash over me,0.403368
the more of an impact it kind of makes I think this you know I,0.10239386
wonder how this movie would do with repeat viewing I want to see it again,0.08090566
it could actually you know I think maybe I think it's just a fun as,0.06374127
I said a fun party who doesn't want to spend more time at a party,0.10933781
but these little moments do shine and I think that I wish that Captain America,0.1241709
Civil War had had had a better grasp of this because that was supposed to,0.107704364
be a whole newly about relationships these specific relationships but perhaps the problem there is,0.057376582
that that will be focused on the - that's right - most self-involved members of,0.0794996
the team Steve and Tony Steve is very self-centered and so seeing the Avengers not,0.33641905
only as a team but as an experience through the eyes of Thor and Bruce,0.06450316
that was fascinating and I'm telling you that yondu moment is coming for Taika Waititi,0.14512084
if he could do that here you know what he did achieve now another reason,0.06362332
that Taika Waititi has to stay is that I didn't get it off of anything,0.07451106
the movie goes by very quickly at a very fast clip and it has a,0.060589183
huge cast and so I could have used more time with each and every character,0.09042459
in fact it really is two movies as many of us suspected I would have,0.050457306
preferred that they had had an entire movie about hella and an entire movie about,0.17718467
Planet Hulk it's Planet Hulk and I almost you know I felt I'm sure Hulk,0.053044517
fans will feel feel it right here if you want to you're gonna have an,0.08272532
emotional moment when you see Hulk you know perhaps his greatest storyline taken away from,0.08202527
him and given to Thor and also stripped of a lot of the emotional heft,0.11229851
and seriousness of that story but you know it still it was good you know,0.08856728
I think considering the problems with the universal situation and a Hulk movie could only,0.069584444
be distributed through them this is the best we're gonna do but and I would,0.14133854
like both those movies to be directed by Tyco over TD so again because no,0.08661021
spoilers here are my quick impressions of the top characters in the movie Chris Hemsworth,0.06452689
as Thor I've always said when I especially you know right after the last Avengers,0.068155415
movie I was like you know age of Ultron I say Whedon gets it he's,0.2251592
the only one who gets it the strength of both Chris Hemsworth in Thor is,0.055353235
comedy well Tycho would Tina gets it too and it makes such a difference I,0.0712047
mean he's here the character is finally realized to a degree that allows him to,0.075422056
stand shoulder to shoulder with cap and Tony cap and Iron Man the way they,0.05325252
were supposed to in the very first Avengers movie Thor is always lagged behind boy,0.194028
did I have fun watching him fly with me on earth that was just a,0.13843754
side note that was a great no saw some great moments but you know again,0.0959186
you know truly realized on the silver screen finally a cate blanchett as hella it,0.13610147
was such a joy to see a female character with not only so much raw,0.305497
power but who wasn't afraid or ashamed or hesitant even to use it it was,0.12248312
so great if I was going and cost you this year for Halloween I totally,0.07486515
go as hell up just the way she walked into a room and owned it,0.5876557
just the way she forget face acting Kate Blanchet does I acting it's amazing I,0.1520625
hope she's part of the MCU for a long long time Jeff Goldblum as the,0.073841535
grand master one does Jeff Goldblum not improve a movie although even more impressive was,0.11564366
that there were a couple of times here where he didn't just seem like space,0.08688489
Jeff Goldblum but he actually blended in with the movie that was pretty neat Mark,0.080233
Ruffalo is the Hulk I'm sad to tell you that you've seen most of his,0.1018679
role in the trailers and the clips that doesn't make it any less fun but,0.03638668
I would have preferred more I mean he has actually pretty small role in the,0.14868595
movie and I'm getting pretty tired of his almost relationships Banner you tease and then,0.29326674
Tisa Thompson as Valkyrie she did as much as possible and makes quite an impression,0.089012705
with what is a very underwritten role and as it's presented here quite frankly unnecessary,0.08283185
some of you have asked me about that her her saying that Valkyrie is bisexual,0.60488844
in the movie no she's not it was never hinted at once and I don't,0.1056264
know why she would say that it just it distracted a little bit from her,0.17007504
character actually to be honest with you because she kept waiting for that other shoe,0.25103173
to drop and it never did so in some ways she didn't feel fully realized,0.15548043
because Tisa Thompson put that out there I will talk about all of them and,0.13514318
everyone else in the movie more in the spoiler review but finally the last thing,0.0750362
I want to talk about here is the score which I just purchased it's so,0.1068327
good by Mark Mothersbaugh it was one of my favorite things about the movie in,0.0850117
fact that I can talk about in the non-spoiler review and it's the perfect fit,0.06133477
for I wrote this down very specifically for a quirky offbeat sci-fi fantasy that wears,0.15101835
it's hard on its sleeve downs me to buy the very large mug and laughs,0.30073076
with a glimmer in its eye as it Pat's you heartily on the back while,0.18709832
telling a good story that's what the score is like that's exactly what the new,0.06016128
Thor is like and what his new movie is like and it's perfect I actually,0.083461106
do feel that this movie could be captured in the in the glimmer and Chris,0.060921937
Hemsworth's eye it's perfect so I highly recommend thor ragnarok just realize the stage at,0.059679657
which this movie is in and also with the stage title with TD is in,0.035345294
as a storyteller I'll get there but this is very very promising it is one,0.07431937
of the most entertaining MCU films I've ever seen and I really I hope that,0.0715114
Kevin Feige can hang on to Taika Waititi and that the Thor trilogy starts here,0.07280277
this just seemed like a fresh start for the character and I would hate for,0.13539365
this to be where he I mean if he has to go out on this,0.110672
note with in terms of his solo movies fine but I can't you know speaking,0.06744732
of cap and Iron Man of the three of them no one deserves another movie,0.11958858
more that I think Thor I was very very happy with it I want to,0.059869956
see what Taika Waititi does next specifically with these characters so that's my non-spoiler review,0.07388165
for Thor Ragnarok leave your own thoughts about the movie down below please don't put,0.1320342
any spoilers please let's try and do our best even if Disney Marvel did not,0.13468309
alright so again write those thoughts down below and you can check out some more,0.10236944
