but my all-time favorite oh isn't this like the famous song from coco everyone talks about remember me until 1942 when he was crowned by a giant bell,0.07633757
that's so dark surely the guy who messed up there's like imprisonment that's so dark disney fully just crushed a man,0.550104
you are a musician no i don't know i mean i only really play for myself,0.40211272
ah not gonna lie,0.1519245
this looks so pretty though the animation the background the colors it's a very vibrant film so far we're not fans of grandma her walk scares,0.17743848
me all this work to bring the family together,0.06665068
i don't want to sneak is miguel,0.10433329
i don't know what his name is i think it's miguel is he gonna meet his whole family tree and they're all gonna inspire him to go back to music,0.24115518
and he's gonna raise how musical his family once was and then he goes to the talent show and wins with the power of family,0.072047174

that's what miguel is i'm gonna play in mariachi plaza if it kills me don't tell me miguel dies,0.5154597
if that happens that's not the darkest disney has gone killing a child surely they're not gonna do that,0.5154597
i'm not certain i don't care if i'm on some stupid offrender okay not a fan of grandma that's a step too far with that many candles around,0.6662213
i'd be very scared that at any second i'd set myself a light i did not like the way that moved,0.15202554
why wasn't it,0.08404315
pushed up against the mantle,0.24106967
that's the health and safety hazard,0.09590418

all right who's in there i'm sorry it's not what it looks like oh miguel is currently dead,0.39062345
i thought the other ones were dead,0.41446766
miguel's dead plot twist see i told you he was gonna meet every single person from his family,0.35492125
oh now that do be some good animation,0.09737491
it's just very pretty the color choices ah it's not nice,0.17505419
oh that's kind of sound when you think about though like why did she have a really young girl on the other side of her and remember oh this is such a pure little film,0.26649925
oh oh this is really cute,0.08505832
this is ernesto,0.11330331
it might be ernesto because his family didn't put the photo up it doesn't look like ernesto though but most importantly you can help me,0.095078275
oh so that's not ernesto,0.24209553
i give up with that theory that he's ernesto i've grown up,0.1566885

i cannot get over it it's just,0.0913677
so nice to look at we're all the ones with no photos or friends no family to go home to nearly forgotten,0.10152958
you know is miguel gonna start putting up this guy's photo in his house every year and he's going to become a part of the family that would be kind of cute ending,0.19406144

oh that's kind of sad,0.095624074
no you're so forgotten that you're erased from history our memories,0.2410172
they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life in the stories they tell about us but there's no one left alive to pass down chicha's stories,0.093148805
that's so sad,0.092786334
oh why is that so sad,0.08558837
why is this old man making me have a midlife crisis,0.3041336
why did he fade away you hated musicians you never said you were the one oh my god,0.36415762
but this beautiful,0.07906111
i love oh it's just this looks so pretty and magical and i can't explain it,0.13561782
but i love all the colors and it just speaks to my soul the word to describe it really is just beautiful this animation this setup this location this scene they just it just works so well this is a tough crowd no one seems that impressed oh yes man my favorite character now that guy who was jumping in the crowd okay but if this was america's got talent miguel here would pull through real strong all he's gotta do is tell a sob story be the child prodigy,0.10737754
he is sing,0.078778766
a sweet little heart out and get the crowd a smile,0.11163594
and bam,0.075661846

it's basically a beacon he could be shouting,0.2369697
it's miguel,0.06134169
i'm here the family man they need help,0.078946464
i can't believe the family's looking everywhere but the stage they really don't want to find miguel,0.049214788
that's the truth,0.035719402
i thought you hated music oh i love them,0.3555473
i remember that feeling when i don't let men ruin things for you is,0.2708567
what this story is they've all banished music,0.14317352
because of one man we don't allow that kind of power from a man in this household in this lifetime in this universe,0.14901607
and i've said it a million times,0.05383771
but i really love that setting i cannot praise it enough oh child abuse i'm calling,0.3558987
i don't know what the child line line is,0.078960896
i'm not calling anyone apparently this feels like showing up to the great gatsby mansion you know gatsby's mansion that's the kind of vibes,0.10170285
i'd be getting is it even ernesto there though it has to be it is he finally turned around lil miguel's been waiting for this day since forever how could i not listen oh family this is so cute [Applause],0.19258343
this is next level,0.060763836
wholesome stuff that sounds like it could possibly be a really sad song are they going to bring that back,0.13162407
at the very end,0.07835726
as miguel says goodbye to the land of the dead to go back to the land of the living you are being forgotten and whose fault is that hector,0.18952
please those were my songs,0.1261956
you took my songs that made you famous he's stealing songs the drama ernesto's a liar,0.69542736
he stole songs he took someone else's career and money we cannot respect that as a nation but in the movie tonight poisons the drink did ernesto poison antos drink,0.44699293
oh my god this became a villain origin story the plot twist i'm going home ernesto hate me if you want but my mind is made up,0.31089434

i hate this story for hector put some more respect on hector's name as i say like i've been mispronouncing his name the whole time like i put respect on it the audacity,0.25855345
i know my reputation,0.054108057
it is very important to me,0.060678203
i can't believe ernesto actually killed someone for music being his friend hector,0.71718836
i feel personally attacked ernesto just keeps getting worse,0.55163807
i should have known there's always a villain in these stories but i'm your family and hector was my best friend his kill count is going up does this man have no limitations,0.53490317
oh my god i should have trusted,0.2596161

that's why the films made coco excuse me is he the actual grandpa wait i'm so confused is that you i don't twist my brain,0.24047501

he can fly,0.0856179
he can fly legendary come lady jump off the platform,0.31089434
she had an option but she stayed on the platform,0.13395084
if you want your two minutes of fame just say i won't judge back off ernesto can get off this stage,0.17897813
how dare he i feel violated,0.674456
i forgot what that felt like no time for a romance,0.15124048
let's get this photo back to the shrine because i want hector having his rightful place and the other side not being forgotten priorities hurry up touch it anywhere see we do not respect ernesto,0.24753402
i really do hate this man too hard to let him destroy everything look at the family working together the power of family and they exposed him on the big screen they were like we're gonna put him on blast whatever it takes now this is some prime time reality tv for the audience also murder which i don't condone [Applause] hell yeah a full circle moment please we love poetry if he fades there's got to be some picture of hector somewhere i will print one i will draw one if i see him turn into dust particles,0.3694105
okay,0.050967906
we didn't see him fade into nothingness,0.06301513
so there's still hope for hector they're not doing this to him well apologize miguel's going to sing remember me mama wait,0.102894224
oh so they bring it back sad twice,0.11380787
that's just rude,0.26802313
oh it's complete like on nothing i predicted about this film was right and i love that we don't want predictable plot lines,0.11131645
that's why this film was so good one year later the next day of the dead hector's gonna come back,0.13079563
he's uncertain but he's gonna go through this time enjoy,0.0933423

i really have to say is uh that was a really lovely and beautiful film highly surprised by it i'm not gonna lie,0.1513897
i went into it not expecting too much,0.13282105

it is criminally underrated where's the respect for this film bro that was so good that was a masterpiece of cinema,0.10523754

i'm just gonna say like disney and pixar this is one of the best it's one of my favorite,0.10196762
now i'm gonna have to add coco to my wall which is such a beautiful film about family and those songs were cute remember me,0.04647327
