the point of this movie is a journey,0.08308296

it's about taking him through his upbringing through the mobs about these two key relationships that impact his life in a very big way,0.15155779

you got smoked up,0.49096087
I was like cinema got some bad bars you got some tan tours you got some Dumbo's you got some elephants in the room that I kind of want to get out of the way before I get to the real meat,0.4541783
and potatoes of this review first one is Martin Scorsese's opinion about cinema and about Marvel movies guys,0.19579439
I don't care,0.2042832
I don't really give a about Martin Scorsese in his opinion on all that to one man he's entitled to his opinion you're entitled to disagree with him,0.15449455
I'm not gonna really be focusing on that drama in this review I don't really see why that would have my approach with this lubing the other elephant in the room,0.10555393
let's call it,0.07006438
the tantor of the situation is the run time this is a very long movie like an exceedingly long movie this is a three and a half hour movie and it definitely earns every single second of that run time,0.08979042
and my humble opinion if you don't like long movies if you don't like mob movies if you don't like long movies that have a lot of scenes where characters are just sitting and talking I feel like this is not going to be your cup of tea,0.104934424
you guys know me,0.08572438
I don't really care about how long a movie is I care about how long it feels,0.13897082
it's all about the execution,0.35078332
it's all about the journey and like I'm going to be using the word journey a lot in this review the other elephant in the room is obviously the CGI d aging because obviously you're depicting these actors in a certain era of their lives where they have to be younger,0.11170508
and obviously all of these actors are older now is,0.15060514
the CGI D aging noticeable,0.09659735
yeah it's noticeable,0.08612777
I mean you can't not notice it,0.09950422
I think our eyes are trained to notice,0.057462133
these things we're all in general after a few minutes,0.080551736
I didn't even really care about it,0.110414915
I was so engaged and engrossed in what was going on with the story the characters the dialogue after a while I didn't really think about it but it is one of those things that is gonna be kind of glaring when you first start watching the movie I don't think it's that big a deal,0.04376004
on Schwartz AC is an absolute master of his craft obviously I believe that because I called him one of the best filmmakers of all time one of those movies where you can tell that there's a master behind the camera that there's somebody who has decades worth of putting out great art,0.10034709
that's that's what this movie is this movie has great are in terms of the camerawork,0.06681292
there is not a single movement not a single angle not a single shot that feels wasted,0.1964711
there's not a single frame that feels out of place movie is eggs on the 10th omelet cities whatever you want to call it,0.1009984
it's a gorgeous beautiful looking movie with great lights those movies where the camerawork has a bunch,0.14930733
of different shots that elevate scenes that you didn't think that it would elevate the same because you didn't think that you would go for that type of shot a lot of shots in this movie where Scorsese obviously wants the scene to breathe a little bit and he wants things to marinate you wants things to wrap so it lingers,0.18909377
and there are a lot of really great lingering moments and lingering shots in this movie in regards to the editing for this movie,0.092616074
I mean good god it's just it's it's it's amazing,0.12512709
it's it's Oscar worthy just like everything else,0.07896515
I don't even remember who did the editing for this movie,0.11702953
I can't remember their name I'm sorry that I can't remember your name but I feel like I want to send you flowers,0.080991805
that's of course your adieu that would be weird,0.31089434
but then again I guess I could send you the flowers you could just give it to your wife or your girlfriend or something all right,0.2478759
well when the this movie is flawless,0.09438113
it is seamless,0.06391401
the transitions are great the way that the scenes are cut together the way the music,0.09241697
flows even though the movie is definitely jumping around to different locations in different,0.0556263
eras never get lost in it,0.11493189
and you never feel like you're out of a scene,0.5085977
you always know exactly where you're supposed to be every single actor in this movie is at the top of their game they bring their a plus plus a game Robert De Niro,0.086421974
this is one of the best performances that you've seen from him in a really long time his character is so restrained,0.10562035
so held back,0.05010657
he has to do a lot of acting in this movie with his eyes with his facial expressions a lot of unsaid morality and turmoil going on with his character like every single scene Robert De Niro is killing it I think with Joe Pesci he came out of retirement he is so cold he is so in control in this role,0.33837312
if you're gonna come out of retirement you better be like Michael Jordan drop to 55 at the garden because that's what Pesci was in,0.114503525
it's Louie hard to say which actor stole the show,0.22368576
but I guess for me maybe Al Pacino because he's playing Jimmy Hoffa and he is the perfect type of over-the-top that Jimmy Hoffa's character deserves,0.07463792
and that's one of the best things about this movie is how well-written it is,0.089437336
how good the script is dialogue in this movie and the acting blends,0.13515389
so great together that you just watch scenes where characters are talking and I was hanging on to almost every word you know it is a mob story,0.13959834
I wouldn't necessarily call it your standard-issue mob story,0.065720186
this is a mob story that has a lot more in its mind than just the high life and about money and women crime and illegal stuff,0.33218965
I mean yeah that stuff's in there but it's not the point feels a lot more reflective a lot more meditative course--a,0.060438942
she definitely wants you to sit here with these characters he wants you to appreciate their thought process,0.1534894
he wants to have some thought-provoking conversations about mortality and about loneliness and about the impact of a life's worth of decisions that maybe you didn't realize it,0.093440436
at the time how it would affect you at the end,0.08907532
if other mob stories are about living fast and dying young this movie definitely addresses the consequences of living,0.1494148
Oh some of the impact that this kind of life can have on somebody it's possible to just give Oscars to everybody like just give Oscars to every single person involved with this movie like just clean sweep,0.1161412
it retire the king that shit's nothing else,0.9176188
I could say about it's just just give them the Oscar even though it is a long movie definitely,0.062587306
I feel like there was only one section of the movie that dragged just a tiny bit one of,0.14965862
the six thousand middles of this movie where they're focusing more on Jimmy Hoffa's legal issues,0.08181326
he dragged for just a second but it's just it's just a second,0.1524
it's like an main issue,0.16913033
I have in this movie is that there is a relationship there's a conflict and attention of an emotional nature between Robert De Niro's character and between one of his daughters older version of his daughter is played by Anna Paquin and she's not really given that much to do the way that they hinted and built this up,0.05971978
I thought that would be more of an emotional payoff but there really isn't don't have any more words,0.06559155
I I can't say enough about how amazing this movie is the Irishman is one of the masterpieces of 2019,0.12079693
I absolutely loved it this one deserves the highest praise of Superman Prime,0.10924908
