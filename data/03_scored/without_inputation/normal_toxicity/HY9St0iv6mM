he just seen a small indie festival film at Sundance called eighth grade and I knew nothing about this film,0.14241019
I knew nothing about the writer and director of bolt Bernal I guess he's a youtuber big-time guy slash comedian and Ellie Fisher is the star of this movie it's by the young girl going through her last week of eighth grade,0.17815505

so guys that's what you want to do on YouTube,0.15050355
you want to help each other not tear each other down so much negativity talking bad about movies and blockbusters look it's about taking care of business and sharing art with one another,0.11474352

oh my god is great,0.06708949
now I don't share the same sentiments about eighth grade as most people do,0.11733538
now I was always kind of a jock always played football baseball basketball I was in dance class yes I was in dance class I never was bullied I don't know what it feels like to be bully or be awkward or different,0.18243942
the only different thing about me growing up is having dark skin sometimes in a white community,0.4725208
that's a whole nother video there,0.11268356
but I never dealt with that pressure of trying to really fit in,0.06831459
now I was the kind of person in junior high and high school I sought out the people who were indifferent in wheelchairs who were just socially misfits and made them part of my crew that's the kind of person I am that's the person I was raised to be,0.37180492
so people like Ellie in his movie,0.17346548
I was drawn to them when I see you sitting by yourself at lunch I would go to your table say hey man what are you doing join us or I'll sit with you,0.31089434
and that's what human communication is all about and meeting friends if you look at some of my videos and some of my reviews sometimes I do live on location you see my friends we're all very diverse all lots of cultures life and different races and we love each other the same,0.07609815
it's not about what's on the outside about what's on the inside and you never know that she opened up your mouth and communicate,0.66709435
hey and nurse trust me we all come in all shapes sizes and colors but I love film I love hearing stories about first-time directors making a splash in a movie industry this movie internet entered in at number 22,0.09187872
but next week it'd be a wide releasing it's going to only do better,0.050220955
but from what I understand the money that is made two hundred and fifty two thousand dollars it's already making more money per theater than most blockbusters are that's a lot congratulations to both burnham that is incredible,0.09016037
but this movie is definitely a coming-of-age story probably one of the best and every father should take his daughter to see this movie it is so encouraging,0.1544507
it's about a week of this girl learning to find out who she is and trying to fit in it is so tough to watch and for me,0.13586153
I was squirming in my seat because I wanted to help her so much because that's the kind of person I am but if you want to see a good film and then walk away you feeling better about yourself as a human being go see eighth grade,0.34922525
it's a great great flick and again Brett,0.09690774
