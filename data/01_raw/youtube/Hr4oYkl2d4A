what's up ladies and gentlemen its Daniel here from the geeks big nation Channel and I'm here to bring you my review of Casablancas only one ever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape because my dear Ricky I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist Olaf if you will but I have to be familiar with the record let me point out just two items in 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia in 1936 you fought in Spain on the loyalist side I got well paid for it on both occasions the winning side would have paid you much better robbery haha well it seems that you're determined to keep Laszlo here I have my orders well I see Gestapo spank My dear Ricky you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo I don't interfere with them and they don't interfere with me in Casablanca I'm master of my fate I am major Strasser is here sir he was saying excuse me so you clicked on the video and you're probably wondering to yourself why is Daniel reviewing the 1942-43 film because there was released in the United States during that Casablanca what what about this film why is he reviewing it so I am taking an independent study course underneath one of my professors here at my college and so I'm gonna be working on films I'm gonna be shooting short films and things that nature I'm really excited but it's as a part of the course I'm writing essays about films and watching films and analyzing them and so one of my first films was Casablanca and in what we're talking about right now is American noir filmmaking and so this is gonna be a kind of artsy fartsy when it comes of this review is I did a lot of time analyzing specific elements about this film so with that guys I'm gonna be doing a lot more of these classic films so keep that in mind because you know I just want to find a way to incorporate what I'm doing in class into my own personal life and continue to have fun with movies because I just love talking about them so much so let's get on with this review 1942 Casablanca this film is a classic by all means of the definition I can say that I don't really watch many classical movies I don't know if it's really a fault to just mean not taking the time out to go do that or I just haven't really had much time to be introduced to them but nevertheless really really old classical films I have really haven't had the chance to watch many of them I haven't seen films like Citizen Kane but that's about it and so I need to really explain my repertoire of classic films but sometimes when you go back and watch old black-and-white films it in a certain sense it can't quite compare using Citizen Kane as example sometimes for me as a modern movie goer in this current day and age it's different for me you know I've seen movies like The Dark Knight I've seen you know I've seen drive I've seen all these things that I loved or the prestige and I've seen all these crazy movies that I love and I have had such an impact of meat and have blown my mind so that when I go back and watch something like Citizen Kane sometimes it gets hard for me to appreciate what that film is because of the time period it came out in and just how far it was pushing the boundaries and just how amazing of a film really is so I try to push that aside and try to really analyze the film for what it is and not only by modern standards but also just enjoy the film for its value and the story that is trying to tell and how it tells it but I can honestly say that Casablanca is an amazing amazing film and that it is a film that transcends time in a sense that it no matter when you watch it is always gonna have that same impact that no matter new goers for this film or old ones the story is just so riveting and intense it's part political thriller but also part you know American war film but also part melodrama and part romance it's it's really really engaging and I really did not expect that going into this film and just being really just blown away by just how engaged I was watching this film as if it was just any other crime drama I had just tuned into watching on cable or something like that I'm kidding no one watches cable so Casablanca the story revolves around Rick played for the amazing Humphrey Bogart who owns this you know this kind of gambling den the seedy kind of place inside of the play inside of Casablanca the city underneath Nazi regime occupation and the story revolves around him meeting this femme fatale from his past his former lover this former flame here's looking to you kid who comes out of his past and comes back to haunt him in a sense and comes back with the proposition based off who she is with now and this whole entire political aspect that goes really into it I don't know why I'm being so cryptic I mean the film came out in 1942 his former lover is buried - the leader of you know this political rebels against the Nazi regime and what I found the most interesting about the film not just that you know the commentary it had on you know the socio-political asked the you know atmosphere at the time but the character of Rick himself was someone very interesting to me I think even in the moment you're first introduced to Rick in the film he is playing at a chessboard alone side room in in we we spent a lot of time analyzing the lighting in this film because it is something phenomenal just looking at the scene where you're looking at the gambling den it's bright it's lively it's smoky it's hazy it has all these weird characters and guys going around probably doing some not good things you know not blatantly out and open there's nothing crazy like prostitution or anything like that going on something obvious going on but you know the people in here are doing things going beyond that and this is this world living in this world where refugees and human flesh you know human beings have price tags to them and human beings are just you know this this currency during this time period and it's very you know it's very like engaging and just makes your skin kind of crawl and when we're first introduced to Rick he's in the side room playing chess like I said and the light the way the lighting is you know it just illuminates his hands like he's playing this game or whatever whatever a visual metaphor you want to go into there's a lot that you can dissect from this film you know of this man who plays his game and the whites but he the way the shadows are going it's like it's the shadows are just really just making up you know the outline of his face and it's so interesting as if he is a man who's you know created morphed and you know just defined by the shadows his dark past which I found really interesting and that he he is more so of an antihero and is not really a hero of an of itself I think he is a man who has a good heart who has good intentions he wants to do good in the world but he sees the circumstances again and he's just a product of that and he's trying to adapt without fully losing who he truly is and it's such a powerful character and Humphrey Bogart gives an amazing performance because he comes off as like you know this like he's given this villainous introduction and he comes off as like this guy who just you know he's very smart he's a one step ahead of the next guy he doesn't care about this he's just doing this to survive to just get on day by day you know what drives this guy but when his ex-lover comes back into his life and that changes who he completely is because when he goes into that drunken tirade with Sam at the club and everything's closed down in the shadows are on him again when he's going back reflecting into his past that shapes him and haunts him you you get this this version of Rick it was just so broken and so driven by his you know his his heartbreak his ache you know but how much he was kicked down by the world and how much wrong has been done upon him and that he's done upon others so interesting and just so riveting just looking at Rick's character and all that he goes through I think the ex-lover played by Ingrid I just typed the paper on this and I can't remember her last name but actress Ingrid did a really amazing job as portraying the character that I believed at the time wasn't very popular you know this very driven independent character who can function without her partner and and but yet still enjoys and has desires and there's nothing wrong having a character that's presented that doesn't have a care about you know what others think of her and what she has and what she wants she's gonna go for it no matter how selfish it is or you know just how it benefits others she's going to try to go after what she wants and she's a very strong character and it's very interesting and the way she also just like Rick is conflicted about all that time they spent together and all this you know there's turmoil they went through after separating due to various circumstances as you all may know if you've seen the film I truly think it was just really really an amazing performance by her and also the you know the Spanish officer who would help the escape at the end and things of that nature who also plays more of a villainous role there's just amazing performances in this film and some amazing uses of lighting which is really key in this film and just how they use darkness and I think that's a you know an a tribute to the characteristics of film noir which I found really interesting and just what made the genre so great is its atmosphere and just how engrossing it really is and I'm really glad I got a sense of that going into the film but I think the only thing I didn't really like about the film just the ending uh-oh which is really bold because I mean come on it's one of the most iconic endings of all time you just looking at you kid and getting on the plane and everything you know this is it's like the start of a beautiful friendship you know all that stuff but I think I guess it's this comes I have to tribute the semi modern sensibilities but the third act is just like it's kind of like I wouldn't say rushed but it's just like it kind of suspends believability at certain parts because he just he just shoots the Nazi commander and he's like hey the command has been shot gang there's just like alright we're not gonna check your pocket we're not gonna check anybody in this room right now who's in near this dead guy y'all just walk out of the hangar bay I actually expected a more tragic ending for Rick I think his ending is gonna be inevitably tragic afterwards you know he's gonna be an enemy eventually of the Nazi regime and this and I think this from 1942 you know warden until 45 so a lot can happen over those few years especially acting as someone trying to work against the Nazi regime and just seeing the side redemptive quality was really great but somehow that ending man was just really really weird it's really weird and it's just like this is beginning of a beautiful friendship forget that part where I tried to kill you I helped you know alright that's how it's gonna happen and he's just like okay okay you know what this is iconic I just I guess I gotta just let this slide but besides that I really enjoyed Casablanca and obviously really had a great time and see that it is a masterful work of filmmaking and it is a film I really enjoyed and want to watch more times than what I have and see it multiple times again even though I have watched the heck out of this movie so with that ladies and gentlemen I'm going to give Casablanca a 9 out of 10 so have you seen Casa Blanca let me know in the comment section down below what do you think of this classic film do you love it do you hate it is there any other classic films you recommend I should watch and my journey of going through this film course this independent study course let me know in the comment section down below guys and anyways thank you so much for supporting the channel working on the video talking about we're gonna be doing next with the channel but until that happens I still got classes to go to stop projects to do and I'm still going to try to keep making videos as much as I possibly can and try to keep it to a regimen even though it's been hard no excuses just gotta get the work done just got to put the work in so with that ladies and gentleman thank you so much for all the support and do not forget that I've been Daniel and don't forget to get geeky you
