this guy he wrote and directed this film and it's something he wanted to make,0.070337184
for a very long time now this is a black and white foreign film set,0.01867237
in Mexico in a different language so a lot of people might have a hard,0.03866646
time getting into it because of that now this film was on various film festivals,0.028276958
where it won some of them and was very well received and now it was,0.024940396
picked up by Netflix and what's good I guess is that Netflix is going to,0.016581697
open up this film to a lot more people that otherwise wouldn't see it because,0.03451106
a lot of these foreign films don't really get seen by wider audiences so that,0.033322375
is pretty good Hurra lead actress in this film is yalitza apprec I and she,0.04507218
was really good as the maid Cleo in this film she had a very quiet,0.08210694
reserved miss to her performance but you can tell so much about just the expressions,0.02811066
on her face and the way she carries herself through these various scenes she was,0.07852692
really good now this movie is set in the 1970s in Mexico City and it,0.01977591
follows the life of this middle-class family and they're made for an entire year now,0.03752035
there's not much of an overall plot per se is more so just like you're,0.055784963
living which with this family and you're very immersed in their life for this time,0.10239837
period now I have to say this has got to be one of the most,0.03717645
overhyped films I've ever seen love reviews are calling this a richly textured masterpiece the,0.03702811
most exquisite and artistic film of the year the best picture of the year the,0.016965508
best film of the decade some people saying this movie brought them to tears people,0.03680328
saying that this is just like the greatest movie ever made so going into this,0.02664127
film my expectations were super super high and I when I came out of it,0.11108434
I felt honestly kind of sonot and i almost feel like I'm going to be,0.0912898
attacked or there's something wrong with me because I did not love this movie like,0.1334365
so many people did so that's where I'm a little bit at a crossroads with,0.016195226
this film and the overhype did not really help matters now I have to say,0.036069583
there still are a lot of positives of this film it is well directed there,0.0877191
are some beautiful shots in this some scenes that come to mind are this Ocean,0.072065994
Beach shot this tracking shot where they made is on this Beach and then all,0.16298862
of a sudden one of the kids is drowning so she goes and runs into,0.09621616
the ocean and the way this tracking shot just follows her from the beach over,0.12903433
the water into the ocean and then back again or sometimes she's the characters are,0.013769967
just moving through the streets of Mexico City and we have this tracking shot over,0.22877066
the streets beautiful stuff there there's this one scene where Cleo the maid is giving,0.045167964
birth and we're on her for such a really long time and I mean really,0.09302527
beautiful cinematography in this film there's another scene where they're in a movie theater and,0.03826203
it's like this really long shot of that and we see these characters in the,0.050385665
background just these background characters and they almost have their own little stories and it's,0.011946033
like things going on there that you can almost just watch this couple making out,0.06509221
in front of them a few rows ahead and they have their almost own little,0.022985421
story you know they're just in the background so stuff like that was really great,0.048261736
now on to some of the negatives for this film while it is very immersive,0.051948182
following this family and seeing their real life it is also just very mundane and,0.057644814
boring and there's really not much of a story here now this is a very,0.049564164
long movie two hours and 15 minutes but I think they only have about an,0.028604893
hour worth of story here and it just drags out for that long runtime because,0.04316643
the director loves to indulge himself with these long shots now this movie opens up,0.058083836
you have four minutes of just seeing this water on the floor the intro credits,0.05845767
are rolling apparently you know the maid is mopping but it's four minutes of just,0.032224823
watching water splash on the floor finally we pan up to the maid and then,0.033124816
we slowly watch her bring the mop down this hallway and then she puts it,0.12185832
in this little like storage closet or something and she goes inside this closet and,0.13872471
she shuts the door and then it is literally a 30-second shot of this doorway,0.21314746
and where she's maybe changing in there or something but it's literally 30 seconds of,0.033488005
the movie of just this doorway nothing else she finally comes out of that doorway,0.080986775
and then she goes into the house so we're talking to be the first six,0.032848764
minutes or so of the movie and we've done nothing finally she's walking through the,0.06322371
house and we see her clean a bit finally have some interactions with the kids,0.16414404
but a lot of the movie is just this these long drawn-out shots that go,0.09170155
on forever mind you it looked beautiful the some of these shots were very nice,0.17068346
but he's really stretching the time here and so much of the movie is just,0.01689899
that it's these super long shots done because they look beautiful but they have no,0.13900675
real merit to the overall story sometimes and they're what I like to call masturbatory,0.46345037
directing it's the director kind of indulging himself and saying oh this is going to,0.0627634
look beautiful and really taking his time to do these long shots but not adding,0.07185114
much to the overall story and it really really drags out the story at times,0.026891379
and makes it slow and very kind of boring now when I got to the,0.051808495
midway point of this movie I really wanted to bail I wanted to bail on,0.07460434
this movie but it was all of these positive reviews calling this the best film,0.037364695
of the decade that made me be like no I have to sit through this,0.027351687
movie and see it through to the end to see how good or bad this,0.04865087
movie really is so I watched the entire thing and I never really got over,0.033849865
that slow miss of the movie and these long scenes so while they look technically,0.0559772
beautiful there is not much here to this overall story and it can really drag,0.062472053
on at times overall while I from an intellectual perspective appreciated the artistic Ness of,0.029532824
this film it was too drawn-out and boring and suffered from a director masturbating to,0.60036886
his own work metaphorically speaking I did not love this movie I liked it and,0.06900482
I think it is worth watching to see some of these scenes but I did,0.04646574
not love it and it is not my favorite film of the year and it,0.03466804
is okay to not like this movie as well it is okay to love this,0.09256496
movie if you're super into it as well but for me I would give this,0.04406908
film a 7.5 out of 10 not too bad but not the greatest film of,0.021831993
