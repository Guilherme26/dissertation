it's retro nerd girl with a film review for you today,0.5368138
i'll be reviewing the movie the wizard of oz released in 1939. starring judy garland frank morgan and ray bolger directed by victor fleming the synopsis is a young farm girl in kansas is transported to the land of oz and receives help from unusual friends to get back home the story this film is an adaptation of the famous 1900s children's book the wonderful wizard of oz by l,0.08919566
frank baum,0.03461841
the author was inspired to write the story after a trip in 1890 where he witnessed a cyclone in aberdeen south dakota and around the same time his wife's niece dorothy had passed away the name for oz was chosen at a glance at his filing cabinet where he saw a through n and o through z the idea for the story closely resembles alice in wonderland written by lewis carroll about a young girl traveling to a strange fantasy land in 1902 a broadway musical inspired bomb to write 13 sequels to the book,0.090853915
two short films were made in 1910 the wonderful wizard of oz and the land of oz,0.081117205
then there was a feature film patchwork girl of oz in 1914 the wizard of oz in 1925,0.109728806
and its sequel the land of oz in 1932. the rights changed hands from samuel goldwyn to mgm in 1934,0.067472346
and although at the time the studio was looking into making a film with a few stars,0.076718986
it wasn't until 1937 that the rights were put to use as it was trying to replicate the success of disney's snow white and the seven dwarfs released that year in 1937. now speaking of disney disney also wanted to make the wizard of oz would later go on to make the return to oz which was released,0.030130502
many years later in 1985 the muppets wizard of oz released in 2005,0.09906563
and as the great powerful released in 2013.,0.010752891
in fact there was a short time that mgm and disney discussed possibly combining forces to make a film but that didn't quite work out,0.024567664
so can you believe that it took 14 writers along with the actors and directors to help write the script that's pretty incredible,0.04121712
we've seen so many cases where there are too many cooks in the kitchen that could sour the meal,0.10944518
but in this case it works,0.055752084
and perhaps it was because it was a collaborative effort by people who were vastly familiar with the book and wanted to do it justice the greatest inspiration came from the book but there were a few things about the book that the film couldn't do because it was a movie,0.030984638
and there was only a certain amount of time to tell the story for instance in the book dorothy encounters the field mice the hammerheads the dainty china country and the country of the quadlings just to name a few the characters were condensed to make the story more palatable which i thought was an excellent choice,0.088701025
it really makes the story a little more snappier getting to the point of the adventure,0.062691405
dorothy's slippers were originally silver in the book but the studio realized that the technicolor production would benefit from the slippers being bolder in color so that it stood out they chose red but by calling it ruby slippers it had more of a magical effect,0.046021797
another part of the story that had to be curtailed was the amount of violence that was permitted to be shown in 1939 for instance in the book the wizard commands the group to actually kill the wicked witch,0.6670426
and not just get her broomstick the film borrowed ideas from the wizard of oz version in 1925 by using the farmhands in kansas as symbolic characters,0.060891155
and oz,0.06842529
and this is actually a way that it helped to tell the story better i rather liked most of the differences in the film and it's basically you know really well put together until about the end where there's a few things that kind of fall apart for me,0.044291705
actually since now watching it as an adult the dialogue is very dated but appropriate for this fun light-hearted story somehow it's been cherished decades after decades making it timeless in a way the pacing in an hour and 42 minutes it's pretty good no complaints for me it always gets a bit murky once the quartet assembles and especially slows down after the group meets the wizard for the first time but generally i don't have much to complain about the flow of the film the challenge the challenge in this story seems to be obviously the main wicked witch of the west and her real world counterpart miss elmira gulch and i agree that she is a challenge but i also feel as if this challenge is part of a bigger problem for our protagonists coming of age at the start of the film elmira has an order to take dorothy's dog toto because he keeps terrorizing her and chasing her cat he even bit her elmira is not just mad at dorothy because she's mean she has had enough,0.1697016
and as a kid watching this film,0.1500529
i never noticed that elmira was actually sounding off real complaints about dorothy and her lack of responsibility towards toto,0.18822151
and that was because i was completely distracted by her mean approach,0.09286491
i really feel bad about that because technically elmira is in the right here so much so that dorothy's aunt and couldn't really stop elmira from taking toto away,0.11257644
well let's get into it a little deeper after watching and reading many reviews about this film a lot of people,0.08192664
think that dorothy wants to leave kansas because the grass is greener out there but that's not true because she likes it in kansas,0.14858992
but she's completely out of place no one listens to her and she seems to be in everyone's way,0.17891178
it's to the point that any m actually says find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble,0.11415979
and that is when she sings the iconic song somewhere over the rainbow longing to find a place where dreams really do come true,0.074694365
and all this happens before elmira even enters the film so ultimately dorothy runs away from home to save toto from mrs,0.06430659
gulch when she learns that her aunt and uncle will be heartbroken,0.17901647
it is then that love brings her home to face her problems,0.24964675
and she has had a big change of heart right at the beginning of the film now if you notice the cyclone happens right after dorothy is on her way back home symbolizing her internal shift turning her perception of the world upside down after yearning for a world without any trouble dorothy finds herself in a whole lot more trouble once she arrives on oz the grass is not always greener and running away from one's problems can cause more of them,0.053707074
these are the lessons that dorothy is learning,0.05820522
but let's get back to the obvious challenge of the wicked witch of the west the wicked witch after hearing that dorothy killed her sister is irate,0.794439
and i would say that would be a very natural response anyone would be traumatized by this and angry when the wicked witch tries to take her sister's ruby slipper which are rightfully hers to decide what to do with possibly a sentimental value,0.43084848
they're actually taken away and put on her sister's killer's,0.61227196
feet wow that,0.06010287
that's really messed up,0.12586859
there's been a terrible injustice,0.11217941
that has been done to her,0.097750366
i think that you know when i was a kid i i was so distracted by the physical,0.15459733
representation of what the film says is good or wicked,0.23532832
and i did not see how wrong our protagonists are,0.07480397
but one great difference in this film,0.07730064
and the book is the depth that they give the wicked witch,0.66973615
and as a villain she is very impressive,0.31089434
and one of the most iconic villains of pop culture now the empathy one thing that we get from this film is that we get incredible likeable characters as much as dorothy may be irresponsible with toto,0.15614888
oh she's just so adorable and incredibly likable,0.31958282
you really instantly just take her side you just you just want her to find her rainbow right her character,0.27813986
arc,0.05575628
actually happens in the beginning of the film when she chooses to go back to the farm and face her problems but the lesson isn't over from her experience,0.10092577
she is having sort of a revelation within,0.07836078
she seems to have an actual physical,0.26660657
look of shock throughout the entire film as we are witnessing dorothy's internal awe-inspiring change and most of all dorothy represents the innocence in us all,0.044756994
and at one point another in our lives when we decide to be better human beings than we once were,0.1749857
and i think of the friends that dorothy encounters in oz are really symbolic representations are the things that dorothy needs in order to face reality like logic love or otherwise compassion for others,0.07329651
and most of all courage to do the right thing,0.05733874
and once over these things are already in her ability,0.11179823
the scarecrow is a man made out of straw,0.4123577
and the first friend that she meets he is stuck,0.12698425
upon a pole as dorothy has been stuck in her way of thinking i believe that the scarecrow who seeks a brain was to show how important critical thinking is using logic and common sense can help a person deal,0.3042243
with many daily problems the real world version of the scarecrow hunk tells dorothy that she should use her head about mrs gulch and not walk past her house on the way home,0.21547547
so toto wouldn't get in trouble and really that makes a whole lot of sense the tin man is an extremely mild-mannered and consider it tin woodman abandoned in the forest,0.1893756
he is the symbol of compassion as he desires a physical representation of that in a heart,0.05989533
he is the compassion that dorothy needs to be considerate of other people dorothy didn't really take in consideration that she might be causing elmira some distress over her cat and her property the cowardly lion is probably one of the most sympathetic characters of all time,0.27308625
but he's full of comedic moments you either feel sorry for him or despise him but either way his reaction to problems is a lot like dorothy's when she decides to run away from the farm instead of facing them the cowardly lion is pretty cowardly,0.5519848
and hardly gets a chance to show that,0.062369227
he has any courage at all,0.09170171
but there is a scene in which it's time to save dorothy from the wicked witch and the scarecrow tells him that he has to be the one to lead them sort of like your mental skills as a person near your logic,0.6972931
telling yourself,0.07199487
hey you've got to do this one thing,0.10237175
and in response the lion says he'll do it for dorothy,0.052340224
so when pushed against the wall courage kicks in when the wizard of oz gives the cowardly lion a badge of honor,0.4425009
at the end of the film he tells him that he has the wisdom to know when to face danger or to run away,0.0857311
this is a very valuable attribute that dorothy needs when she goes back home to kansas the friends that dorothy meet are seeking things that they already have inside them just as dorothy already has all of these attributes inside of her,0.09931747
and now all she has to do is recognize them and use them,0.08352563
now the technical aspects it actually took five directors to make this film,0.0733684
with victor fleming taking the main credit for the final product during the filming there were several replaced actors and changes in the look of the characters seeing some of the pictures really make you wonder how the film would have been seeing these iconic characters and their potential alternative costumes it just proves how very important,0.03741324
it is to get the costuming just right,0.054245092
because it is one of the most outstanding results that make the film,0.05586071
so captivating the work done for the costumes and makeup really hold up over time,0.08104144
and it's truly remarkable as there is so much emphasis on getting things truly right,0.059509184
in many scenes dorothy's hair appears to be at different lengths due to the costumed switches,0.0790944
and many of the scenes were re-shot several times,0.17990316
the witch was originally just to look like an appealing modern woman however to stick more closely to the book the filmmakers decided to make the witch look more sinister with exaggerated features,0.5562209
and i especially liked the idea of putting her hair back in a bun,0.48592052
the green makeup was a wonderful touch that was absolutely exquisitely done the prosthetics used for the wicked witch was actually also very well done for 1938 and nearly undetectable in some scenes the actors unfortunately had to suffer quite a bit for their costume work as well as some actors,0.40330896
we didn't even get to see on screen more,0.0599957
commonly known the tig man was originally to be played by buddy epson who was well into the production having recorded music and filled much of the tin man scenes until he fell ill due to an allergic reaction to the makeup that was used for the character real lion skin and fur was used to make the cowardly,0.31089434
lions costume to give it an authentic look which was heavy and extremely hot,0.24017172
so you can imagine that the combination of dead animals and sweat made that costume really stinky mgm recruited extra help from the studio mail room and courier service to become makeup artists each recruit was instructed in one area of prosthetic application for an assembly line process each morning one interesting thing that happened was that the wardrobe department accidentally chose a coat for professor marvel from a second hand store which turned out to have a label indicating that the coat had been made for the late al frank bomb,0.25162107
there are a lot of creative hacks on this film to pull off unique visual feats the horses in the mrl city palace were colored with jello crystals,0.15977089
so you can actually see the horses lick it off,0.59631324
in a few scenes,0.08723748
the famous surrender dorothy skywriting scene was done using a tank of water,0.07474464
and a tiny model of the witch very creative the tornado was a 35 foot long muslin stocking spun around the look is very impressive the shot of dorothy's house falling from the sky was a reverse shot of a miniature house being dropped onto a painting of the sky,0.2404254
i think that's completely genius,0.08211607
the sets gloriously bask in all of its colorful splendor exploring this fantasy world with great creativity,0.3710369
these were all decorated sound stages,0.07102723
but that's part of the charm it's almost as if we're flipping through the pages of the book and looking at those beautiful imaginative illustrations ey harburg and harold arlen were given 14 weeks to come up with the film's musical score,0.07780815
and it is truly a classic and you you absolutely know it,0.10889747
when you hear it and you can't help singing along to the songs,0.106552795
the song over the rainbow was nearly cut from the film can you believe that it won an oscar for best music original song,0.04881241
and this was judy garland's signature song until her passing it was also ranked number one by the american film institute in 2004 on the 100 greatest songs in america's films list as well as re-recorded by several musical artists performances to me the performances were fantastic because the actors are acting the way that they were instructed to,0.020921694
and this is a stylized form of acting of overacting actually specifically to appeal to the children of 1939,0.07077305
it's all a part of america's wholesome image at the time,0.090007626
now does the acting hold up yes and no we know it's corny,0.3533762
and it's actually part of the reason why the film is so entertaining endearing and dare i say magical it just wouldn't be as bewitching if it were acted differently it would probably be,0.078708746
i mean i would have to say it would probably be really boring,0.11926815
it wouldn't be as fun,0.1386813
and julie garland was wonderful as dorothy though she's not wearing a visually cumbersome costume,0.3589389
she actually suffered a lot for the role having to wear a very painful corset around her torso to look more like a pre-adolescent child,0.44692525
and the beautiful ruby,0.084870465
slippers,0.044256378
were rumored to be quite torturous to wear frank morgan was incredible playing the role of professor marvel the wizard of oz the gatekeeper the carriage driver and the guard he plays all of the parts very jolly and boisterous with a chameleon charm ray bulger played hulk and the scarecrow excellently putting his fabulous acrobatic dancing skills on show rey said later in interviews that the rubber prosthetic that he had to wear on his face that mimicked a woven pattern actually left lines on his face that took more than a year to vanish bert lahr as zeke and the cowardly lion was great having so much great delivery of his comedic dialogue uh he brings forth many of the most funniest and endearing moments of comedy in the film jack haley was fantastic as hickory,0.2652214
and the tin man he manipulated his voice while playing the tin man saying that he felt that the tone should be soft something like the way he would read a bedtime story to his son,0.14592095
it was a wonderful decision as you really get the sense of how compassionate and sensitive his character is in the film one of the biggest standouts in this is margaret hamilton playing mrs,0.06428692
gulch and the wicked witch of the west her iconic performance is the only way that you can put you can call it,0.6222293
it's just iconic was so thrilling and memorable that it's been copied quoted and obsessed about through the decades,0.06557364
margaret hamilton said that her approach to the character was that the wicked witch was a person who relished everything,0.5120319
she did,0.06153479
but who ultimately was a sad lonely figure a woman who lived in constant frustration and she never got what she wanted and you really get the sense of that from her performance the film was also very popular for the over 100 little people who would make up the citizens of munchkinland as a kid seeing them was a very magical experience,0.15612486
i mean i just wanted to live in munchkin land,0.2985188
because everything there was so happy and lively and you know their performance was such a big part of the nostalgic enchantment of the film and paved,0.04896462
the way for,0.04516635
so many actors of short stature,0.11508316
the best part of the film the whole thing i just love this movie so much and i find the the i find it so very amazing and fun,0.06957461
i i enjoy myself every time i and i specifically cry at the scene where dorothy is singing the song over the rainbow,0.1490597
i it's a guarantee every single time,0.06748973
the ending the ending wraps up pretty quickly,0.1347707
but it works for me mad tv spoofed the ending and asked the same question of many of the fans who wondered about the good witch glinda,0.30040562
why didn't she tell dorothy how to get home as soon as she put on those ruby slippers but i think that the biggest problem here is that that the good witch glinda is actually a combination of the good witch of the north and the good witch of the south and if they were two different characters i believe it would have made more sense as a storytelling piece,0.15146837
my wish list sadly,0.1060958
many of the wicked witch of the west's scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely because they were deemed too frightening for audiences,0.53490317
but i would have loved to have seen them,0.06452237
because those critics who say that the wicked witch is more bark than bite,0.64263266
i am hoping that those clips would have changed their minds,0.14871427
perhaps this was also part of the symbolism so and the wicked witch isn't really a very hard challenge for the group,0.50453657
so in a way the wicked witch really stands for a challenge that really seems like it's much bigger and harder to get over than it is nonetheless i would love to have seen those scenes where she's a little nastier and uh moreover it seems like the whole thing really wraps up really fast at the end it could have used about five more minutes of storytelling,0.5154597
my enjoyment i like so many other people grew up seeing the wizard of oz at least once or twice a year since i was a kid and it's really filled me with a great deal of wonder about dorothy and this land of oz i've read the books and i've read different adaptations i've seen so many different adaptations on film and it's just something that's still very the only word i could think of to describe this is magical,0.050925218
i think i may have used that word at least six or seven times,0.07050541
maybe eight more times in this video but it's truly the only word i could think of to really describe this movie it still has that same feeling for me,0.09889925
every time i watch this film it's still there,0.08682794
and that's what really makes it a classic the film wasn't a big hit at the box office,0.13238892
though uh when it came out 44 million people tuned in to see,0.0843222
its first television broadcast on november 3rd 1956 and aired every single year often on easter sunday on cbs for nearly 40 years according to the library of congress the wizard of oz is the most watched film ever,0.06443617
and this is one thing,0.06849396
most of us have in common with each other at least at one point or another most of us have seen this,0.07168025
there's no place like home is the last mantra that the film instills in to its viewers leaving many with the idea that dorothy learns not to venture out into the world but to love it right at home,0.043708023
i think that doesn't really make a lot of sense because it doesn't tie into her change of heart just before the cyclone takes her to us instead,0.05826193
and this is just my point of view,0.052576542
i believe that dorothy learns how to use her logic and how to love and to have courage in order to deal with her real life circumstances at home,0.1854488
and she needs not seek happiness anywhere else,0.12825283
if she can't have it at home,0.14695752
and i kind of really love that message because it's it's about being an individual,0.114334464
wherever you are bringing with you,0.08027226
the the upbringing that your family has taught you and bringing with you your standards and and your sense of self wherever you go,0.40317276
so no matter where you are you're always at home,0.30439407
my rating is a 9.5 well that sums up my review this is retro nerd girl signing off take care movie lovers,0.4602133
i'm off to my next review,0.09130273
do you,0.053953506
