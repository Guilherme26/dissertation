Lady Bird is one of those very few movies who well the perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes until that one guy gave it a thumbs down
"How could you? At least we still have petting, too"
Sounds fun
"My name's Tim, You catch and Ladybirds two beautiful directorial debut of Crater Gerweck, All kind of because she actually co-directed a film Nights and Weekends exactly ten years ago, which no one seems to mention any more"
"But since Lady Bird has her a movie and her movie alone, I guess that's okay, She wrote the script and also directed it, and it's one of the liveliest most charming first directed movies out there"
Admittedly the high point was almost overwhelming and I wish they could have seen it completely fresh
"It didn't blow me away, but I can't deny that I had a wonderful time with Kerouac's nostalgic and yet fresh take on the coming-of-age formula"
"Lady Bird has many autobiographical touches, and don't go excess That she was a very different teenager from the one depicted on screen"
"The film takes place from 22 to 23, when she herself, like the girl in the movie, graduated from St"
Francis Catholic High School in her hometown of Sacramento
"It's a comedic drama that covers this very important transition phase in a girl's young life, and it would describe it as the Age of Seventeen meets Rushmore, quirky and light, and yet very authentic and down-to-earth The TAT, Lady Bird refers to Saoirse Ronan character whose real name is actually Christine, but she wants to be called Lady Bird instead"
she's a high school senior from
"as she describes it, the wrong side of the tracks"
Her family is on the poorer side and her father is struggling to find a new job
"Lady Bird is a little rebellious, at least the way you think you are when you are 17, And she longs for adventure and sophistication"
Like most teenagers or human beings
"In general, she thinks she is destined for better, cooler things, and she can't really wait to get out of Sacramento to go to big places like New York"
"The movie moves at a very nice pace, always coming up with great little scenes and it's awakening those, a very important last month of school in short and yet wonderful 90 minutes of screen time"
Great Agaric seems to have a natural talent for filmmaking and it's simply a joy to watch Lady Bird unfold in front of your eyes going in
"I already have heard how great Saoirse Ronan is and it's true, but I didn't know about Laurie Metcalf as her mother, Marion, and the funny thing is that a sort of film at a press screening the morning of the Oscar nominees and announcement, and seeing her on the list for the best supporting actress made me really happy"
"I've known her ever since Roseanne, and she's incredible as Christine's loving mother, who has to deal with her daughter growing up and wanting to go far away"
"Their relationship is one of the best and deepest mother/daughter relationships and films, and the polar opposite from the one in I, Tanya, which was the other standout last year or this year, depending on when you've seen the movies"
"But even though we start with Lady Bird and her mother in the car, it's not so clear at the beginning that their relationship will turn out to be the emotional core of the film because Lady Bird beautifully shifts between different characters and surroundings"
"The theater class at school, hanging out at a friend's place, going to the supermarket where her brother and her brother's girlfriend work, and so on, Lady Bird is filled with good characters and wonderful performances, And Lucas Hatches might have one of the best agents in Hollywood"
"That guy just keeps popping up in great movies from the Grand Budapest Hotel to Manchester by the Sea, and now three billboards outside of Missouri, as well as Lady Bird"
"He placed the romantic interest, and the film succeeds in giving you that special magic that you feel with first laughs"
We're not drifting away too much into quirkiness
"Timothy Gemma Man also has a small role and in both Call me by your name, for which he got nominated as Best Actor in a leading role, and Lady Bird, He plays a young guy who comes too soon"
Lady Bird is a warm and heartfelt movie and it got so much praise that I'm afraid I can't really add that much to the conversation right now
"I don't think it brings something groundbreaking to the coming-of-age drama, but it is told in such a lovely fashion that it's almost impossible to leave the theatre with anything but joy in your heart, And it's emotional core, and the great characters helped a lot to make it more than just a light-hearted a feel-good movie"
"In German, I'd say Lady Bird Psyche was Fernet, a lovely mother, and create a girl, vaguest or Jenkins, a nadir Xuan's Mota, thought of opinion"
I give Lady Bird eight out of 10
It's more like 8
"2 but I don't do that what I'd really like us to be on Math Olympiad, But math isn't something you're very strong in that we know of yet"
"All right, is it like? always come below and let me know what do you think about Lady Bird, and also let me know what are some of your favorite Coming-of-age stories"
My next review will probably be another Coming-of-age story
