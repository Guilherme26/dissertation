what is going on guys welcome back to my channel and this is my review for the 2019 French film portrait of a lady on fire this movie was directed by Celine ski Amma and this is about a young painter who is commissioned to paint a portrait of a bride-to-be but the bride is reluctant she does not want to get married and so this painter must paint her in secret as she spends every single day with her walking on the beach and just being a friend and little does the bride-to-be know that she is being painted by someone she admires and respects this is a film that I've wanted to see for a while it's a movie that you know kind of was unjustly not nominated for the Academy Awards and I thought that was a little interesting so I wanted to see really what this movie was truly about and if this movie did deserve an Oscar nomination for Best International Feature and I gotta say that it deserved a Best International Feature nomination this is a movie that is beautiful number one the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking it is the first film to be conceived that I have seen in 8k all of the colors are so rich they're so clear I mean it looks unrealistic because it's so realistic and that's the thing that this movie truly has going for it is it has this beautiful way of almost painting every single scene knowing that this is a movie about a painter who has to paint this bride-to-be and this is a film that has a beautiful love story that is almost hopeful but yet hopeless and that's the thing that I think I I loved the most about this film is it tells it from a very real perspective these two women they fall in love but the problem is is that there's no way that this romance is ever going to last and because of certain obligations that one of them has to having to be married to a man that she doesn't even know or she hasn't even met and this this painter who kind of lives by herself and has to be almost independent and so it's a very secretive affair or relationship that these two women have and it's told from a very realistic perspective of how this actually would never happen in a true society back in the time period that this movie said him that's one thing that this movie has going for is that it is a very beautiful love story that truly shows the true strengths and the true weaknesses of a true romantic encounter in true romantic relationship and these women it's almost like they have to rush everything all at once because they only have so much time to spend with one another before they both have to part and go their separate ways and it's it's heartbreaking it's very heart wrenching and you feel for these two characters as they finally have that happiness that they've been longing for throughout the entirety of their lives now the thing about this movie to me also that I thought was very well done is the way that this movie paints the scene of the setting around these characters again the cinematography is almost painted on it's so gorgeous but to setting them itself on this island it just almost has an eeriness to it it's it's almost a little creepy but they never try to go for a hauntings and that's the thing that I really respect it for because this is a movie you could look at in certain scenes where you think oh are they gonna go like a little bit more of a paranormal route are they gonna go like a little bit more of this like creepy contingent route but they never do that they keep it very contained they know exactly what they're doing and it's a very different romantic film because it's it's a movie that almost essentially is it romantic and the fact that it is so romantic and I don't know if that makes a lot of sense but they don't ever truly romanticize these characters or make them out as their objects and that it's a very lustful relationship it's very much a loving relationship between these two characters the one thing that I will say is is not a negative but it's something that I was a little bit maybe dissatisfied with is the way that the movie wraps up because I thought that to me the way that they ended it made sense but to me I was a little dissatisfied in the way that this movie kind of wraps itself up because essentially these two characters after they have their romantic time together and they have this love for one another they go on their separate ways and essentially they don't ever really meet up again only in certain sir stances that I don't want to discuss because I don't want to rob you of any spoilers or any potential spoilers for this film and so the way that they kind of wrapped these characters up in the satisfaction of them kind of meeting again at the end of the film never happens and it never comes into fruition and so that is a little bit disappointing because you definitely want to see the conclusion between these two characters and the restitution as well between both of them as they both have this longing for one another and they do things that are beautiful that symbolize that both of them still love each other but they don't do it to the effect of bringing them together and that's the one thing that I think this movie could have done a little bit better of a job of doing but I get the fact that they want to be more realistic and they don't want it to be like essentially a formulaic romantic film but anyway guys this is a great movie I think that this is a fantastic international film that I think all of you can enjoy and I'm really happy that I was able to watch it as part of my foreign cinema review series
