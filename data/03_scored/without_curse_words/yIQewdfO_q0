cat dude and Sarah Connor anything is possible I guess you hey then movie chick,0.46825674
here and today reviewing the shape of water Guillermo del Toro is quite possibly one,0.07446778
of my all-time favorite directors his hauntingly beautiful and gothic designs and backdrops though relatable,0.13701434
and quirky characters the grand and fantastical spectacles each film exudes while still maintaining its,0.05163064
own individuality very much akin to Kubrick's filmography whether it's a straight-up horror movie a,0.13863604
coming-of-age story a comic book hero flick Bronte s ghost story or a beat-em-up kaiju,0.2572245
film I adore how del Toro is not afraid to let his freak flag fly,0.53490317
and how he isn't afraid to change it up with each film while they do,0.070226066
still carry very similar themes honestly if I were to nitpick any of his films,0.2636017
I real only have a short list and that would be crimson peak and Pacific,0.05237468
Rim and for the same reason the main actor playing central protagonist ends up giving,0.088196605
the weakest performance as well as being the most least interesting character amongst a very,0.1263274
colorful cast I have nothing against Charlie Hunnam but if you pitted him against eager,0.13919806
Salva I would pick Elba every time also Rinko Kikuchi had a way more intriguing,0.058667712
an emotional backstory and was the true underdog in the narrative and then you have,0.12427911
Mia Wasikowska I don't think I've ever seen the girl emo I don't blame her,0.29591772
for the Alice in Wonderland movies but she's got no excuse in films like Jane,0.24835853
Eyre and crimson peak when she's supposed to be clearly terrified or in love she,0.10541695
just looks like she's doped up on valium or popped a couple of xanies off-screen,0.18276729
I can't stand her acting and she really brought the film down for me but,0.17502153
you should still give it a watch for the gorgeous set design and Jessica Chastain,0.07339438
being amazing as per usual so the shape of water first sparked as an idea,0.0849077
that Deltora had at six years old when he first watched Creature from the Black,0.36587
Lagoon and wondered when actress Julie Adams would shack up with the creature unconventional romances,0.19157173
are nothing new for Del Toro but Hellboy didn't get me nearly as emotional as,0.08120232

duo form a bond inspiring Eliza to risk everything to try and break the creature,0.25796595
free but how long can she keep him safe before the obsessive entwisted Strickland uncovers,0.16803287
the truth Sally Hawkins as Eliza is probably the best performance I've seen this year,0.060209975
I'm sorry Franco but you come at a close second I've seen Sally Hawkins and,0.1487669
a few other projects including fingersmith though personally the handmaiden is a far superior adaptation,0.14348121
and you should check that out and said but I digress regardless she is superb,0.15141097
in this movie to be the only character without a voice takes a lot of,0.0840395
nuance and talent she's not simply some demure innocent sheltered girl she's a grown woman,0.40324992
who has been made to feel left out by society and that she is an,0.16205321
outcast and unworthy of love she is unabashedly a woman with relatable needs and desires,0.5154597
Sally Hawkins also learned sign language for this film and personally I feel she pulled,0.08267123
it off very well I mean I'm no expert of sign language I I've only,0.08754222
seen children of a lesser God but for me she was pretty damn convincing however,0.5867431
her characters only further enhanced by those around her so let's start with her gain,0.120733
a burn confidante Giles played by Richard Jenkins he is probably the one who got,0.13397309
me the most emotional in this film he's an older man who's a recovering alcoholic,0.53490317
who's trying to get his life back together but also rediscovering his new self as,0.28098506
a gay man in the 50s at first he purposefully closes himself off from the,0.31089434
world and will only live vicariously through his obsession of film and music it's something,0.14888383
I can heavily relate to back when I was in my early 20s I suffered,0.034312952
from depression I never left the house I became a complete shut-in and the only,0.2742967
thing that kept me going was my love of film it was sort of that,0.08539449
escapist fantasy that took away the pain that I was feeling Jenkins actually has a,0.09703191
scene in this film that got me the most upset and teary-eyed not only does,0.15105657
he have to face discrimination at one point but he watches other people who he,0.17331865
finds are just as much pain as he is he's through that taught to be,0.14940757
brave and selfless Brea's Eliza already having these qualities she learns self-worth Michael Shannon as,0.24792181
Richard Strickland creep me the out a strict religious man who's very prejudiced and only,0.37316886
knows the rules that he's been taught to live by get married have kids buy,0.101571016
house get an expensive car and a cushy job and yet he is very dissatisfied,0.24754918
and it really starts to mess with his mental state especially when he comes across,0.47142884
the creature and meeting Eliza I think Shannon is an enormous ly talented actor who,0.40114516
can play an eclectic variety of roles but I always feel he's at his best,0.06771661
when he plays a villain not just because of his unique look but because he,0.15357241
knows how to add layers to that kind of character and give them a really,0.058264542
great doctor hofstetler portrayed by Michael Stolberg it's also a very surprisingly layered character and,0.14142892
I feel very vital to the themes of this film especially for today's audience he,0.07189424
is a Russian spy pretending to be one of the scientists at this facility so,0.110462606
he can also study the creature for his country however he develops a strong conflict,0.17683129
between serving his own people and having this genuine admiration for the said creature I,0.14773059
was constantly on edge whenever he was on screen because I was never sure what,0.06253299
fate had in store for this character I was really surprised I felt any kind,0.11913615
of empathy for him at all like it's not usually the case in these type,0.14933278
of movies Octavia Spencer plays Zelda the best friend and co-worker of Eliza while she,0.11728899
doesn't get much to do for the central plot what seeing she does have she,0.101419576
knocks him right out of the park she gets the funniest lines but she also,0.15531228
gets some really great tense moments especially between her and Michael Shannon lastly we need,0.080738746
to talk about Del Toro's longtime partner in crime Doug Jones what can i really,0.09843715
say about his portrayal that i can't say about his other incarnations just like andy,0.2918835
serkis this man has made a living out of playing characters solely in elaborate prosthetics,0.2668871
and makeup and he's damn good at it his character just like Eliza is also,0.5154597
without a voice but his body language and facial expressions speak volumes he also exudes,0.15471162
a much more sexual energy about him and has a lot of romantic charisma with,0.45764497
sally hawkins it was handled in a very poetic and mature way but yeah I,0.11898233
can see people finding this a bit strange for me this isn't anything new I,0.15210894

with the TV show gargoyles at a much younger age god I was a rude,0.31089434
kid also for anyone who's familiar with del Toro's work this is a very Brady,0.07573
ture movie lots of tits and ass and some squeamish gore it's not as like,0.93250376
overblown as say Eli Roth's films are but he knows how to set up a,0.08300287
gore scene to make you just feel uncomfortable and stressed out to the point that,0.13519323
it sometimes is hard to watch I still can't watch the face slicing seen from,0.16189648
Pan's Labyrinth this is a film if I had to put it in the simplest,0.10985476
of terms is basically a gothic mashup of the Iron Giant and splash like a,0.18870059
really rated R in all seriousness this is definitely Gil Armel del Toro's best word,0.05853237
right up there with Pan's Labyrinth everything fits together there's not one stale performance in,0.098232165
the bunch the cinematography is creative as well as a set design music feels like,0.07557642
