us is written and directed by Jordan Peele and it's his follow up to get,0.053007647
out which was excellent and extremely surprising I love whenever someone takes a different career,0.14788114
path and you would expect like when Jim Carrey was like in Truman Show and,0.17087753
eternal sunshine back to back I was like this is not what I expected from,0.08741111
Ace Ventura and get out was definitely not what I expected from noise but I'm,0.09226937
glad that we got that because I loved his sketches on Comedy Central but to,0.070012815

movies give me all the horror I wanted I want them all right now just,0.44450215
let me have them all the good ones people need to make good horror people,0.55875134
need to watch good horror people need to support this genre and it's something I'm,0.15916042
very passionate about and hopefully one day I can contribute to myself and it's something,0.052585308
I'm really excited about and I got to say I am just so happy that,0.072009645
Jordan Peele is making movies like this this film was nlgger awesome get out was,0.15519963
so surprising and so different but also just so goddamn entertaining and he wasn't Oscar,0.71697843
for the screenplay and so coming off of that obviously there's some pressure to see,0.0366653
what you do and I'm happy that he didn't change himself you know like he,0.1058142
didn't become some pretentious version of what he already was doing so well us is,0.119086996
more of a pure horror film than get out was get out had a lot,0.391578
of social commentary it was very funny this film has both of those as well,0.06277671
but it has a lot more of the horror stuff there's a lot of blood,0.24806665
people creep around hallways holding fireplace pokers so it's definitely a horror movie it has,0.24028485
all the things that a genre fan would want out of a film like this,0.087411314
brutal kills lots of blood and incredible score I'm amazed this is only this composers,0.6364068
second score get out being his first for film anyway according to his IMDB it's,0.10606515
so good I want to buy it I want to listen to it I like,0.064475566
to listen to horror movie soundtracks if I'm writing horror it kind of puts me,0.15228458
in the mood gets me in that field you know what I mean and this,0.10353828
is definitely one of those that I would like to buy and listen to over,0.06346718
and over but it stands out because of the fact that the film can be,0.04187016
interpreted in so many different ways there are some aspects of the movie that are,0.05136382
very obvious that tell you what's happening but then there's a lot of it that,0.06329868
is ambiguous and it's definitely a film that on second viewing you're going to appreciate,0.088046946
more and I can't wait to see it again I'm gonna go see it again,0.09817787
this weekend with my friends because I want to look at it through a different,0.075771905
lens and I want to try to examine some of the imagery that peel's shows,0.082384706
in the film and and what he's going for because there's aspects to it that,0.03617879
are you can look at it I'm trying so hard not to spoil it and,0.13557103
I won't don't worry you can look at the film a certain way and accept,0.068631634
what it is the first time you watch it and it works in that way,0.06979786
but you can also view it from a from a certain lens and I really,0.0770194
love that I love movies that evolve when you watch it again and I am,0.078858435
so excited to do that because this film begs that it really wants you to,0.11185036
think about the film and to have a conversation because there's a lot of ways,0.08794384
you can view the movie it can be an allegory for duality it can be,0.066871785
an allegory for how we view other people you know what is our perception of,0.035681598
the enemy is the enemy within our own selves or is it someone else how,0.12915114
do we personify what we view as an enemy and this movie has a really,0.12425636
clever way of exploring those questions but like I said purely from just a filmmaking,0.12805359
standpoint the movies really well-rounded Lupita Nyong'o is incredible in the movie she is so,0.11542336
damn good in this film that the Oscars will just ignore her and she will,0.6364068
not receive a nomination that's how good she is in the film I say that,0.09320631
because Toni Collette was so good in hereditary the best performance I saw last year,0.05690377
and she did not receive a nomination but this this could break the trend of,0.0768646
the Academy historically ignoring horror films as a genre because it just I like it,0.15825044
might and really everyone in the film is terrific the family has to portray you,0.06319139
know the main characters as well as this doppelganger family and they're so different Winston,0.15208906
Duke also putting aside the fact that everyone plays a dual role his character has,0.061931796
to be scared while also being really goddamn funny throughout the whole film and he,0.6364068
pulls it off and that's another thing I loved about this movie is that the,0.13434651
way the comedy is interwoven throughout it often times and scary films a character will,0.087276444
pause to make a joke in the middle of a scene you're like really man,0.35303319
like you that wasn't funny like someone wrote that and made you say it'd be,0.19159901
better but in this film the comedy really worked because it felt like a family,0.08161044
dealing with this insane horrendous situation and then taking a breather and observing how purely,0.36250865
bizarre it is and just just having to acknowledge the humor in it and I,0.07307662
thought that it just worked perfectly I have really only one major issue with the,0.05521155
film and you know don't worry no spoilers there's an aspect to the movie that,0.07172273
I would have loved to have been more ambiguous but it kind of lets you,0.18743259
know and I just wish that it said no you guys figure that out for,0.07231496
the next 30 40 50 years and argue about it forever I wish that that,0.0567709
was how things happened during a certain sequence instead it's like no this is what,0.062160898
it is and I just I like ambiguity and I wish that it was a,0.04783303
little more ambiguous and really other than that I think this is a extremely well,0.06940365
made horror movie a great second film from Jordan Peele if he wants to continue,0.11981048
in the horror genre please do it needs you it really does if you want,0.15549807
to make other films great I want to see it I want to say anything,0.18412173
that guy does even if he makes a movie that maybe isn't as good as,0.17780466
these two that he's made already in in the future I guarantee it'll be interesting,0.078274496
I guarantee it'll be something that you'll want to see just because he made it,0.06834178
I'm gonna give us an a-minus I don't like comparing but just for the sake,0.15038475
of this video I will get out is probably the stronger film thematically but is,0.06488979
a better paced horror movie and it's just like this pure horror film almost from,0.23523879
start to finish and in that aspect i feel like i'll rewatch us many more,0.1491077
times plus i want to because it kind of begs you to do that so,0.19496237
I'm very excited for more people to see the movie and I'm just excited for,0.1172861
horror as a genre right now guys thank you so much as always for watching,0.19417797
