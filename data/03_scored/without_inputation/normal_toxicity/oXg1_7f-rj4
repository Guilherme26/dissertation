Angola that soundtrack the glitch out but I'm gonna have to keep it real and,0.21511222
say that y'all mighta overhyped us a little bit hey everyone is Sharonda from paperweights,0.14471856
and today i'm going to be reviewing a star is born which is a bradley,0.101777054
cooper directorial debut and also a star's bradley cooper and Lady gaga so basically this,0.1895729
is this is the 40 it's the 4th okay you know what I always complaining,0.110643715
about reboots remake this the fourth day I'm a star is born' okay yeah but,0.103010885
I have to say it was entertaining to watch I actually had the chance to,0.066916615
see the 1976 version which starburns first race in and this kind of falls along,0.1521404
the same lines what I did not do is I waited until it after I,0.09009075
saw a star is born in theaters first to not ruin any plot wise to,0.09844954
watch the 1976 version which is the most recent version before this that was remade,0.079131745
and so they kind of fall along the same lines there are subtle differences and,0.06957115
things that happen but the gist of the story is exactly the same and so,0.051856957
this film centers around Bradley Cooper who plays he's a famous musician called Jackson Maine,0.13313057
and he meets Allie who is played by Lady Gaga who was an aspiring singer,0.10532218
they happened to meet by chance in the neck fall madly in love and basically,0.15246248
he kind of helps catapult her career in to stardom and so then it kind,0.14839336
of just details as she's having this starting her career it kind of showcases their,0.13288519
love story which is Voki depressing as hell and also to kind of how their,0.3305794
relationship begins to like break down due to Jackson's alcohol and drug addiction and so,0.09646557
I have to say like you know first I was hearing everyone talk about this,0.10728148
when they were coming out of tip now it's like okay like I'm geeked about,0.14534582
this and it's like oh my gosh is movie is so good but let's see,0.10972905
Lady Gaga Oscar Oscar Oscar everybody's gonna get an Oscar nomination for this film so,0.1327462
I was absolutely actually excited to see this I've always loved Lady Gaga as a,0.08927513
singer always says she can say and baby the music in this movie is on,0.11032143
points like on point-to-point and Bradley Cooper okay I see you what you learn yellow,0.26632127
voice you can say a little bit of stuff you took lessons to voice lessons,0.08740194
learn how to sing to play guitar and I think that it actually pays off,0.14963254
and you can definitely tell it the chemistry between these two I think that helped,0.03778261
believe their relationship it helped make a better movie because they just look great together,0.07052172
but what I would have to say is that Bradley Bradley had me thinking that,0.10476212
he was like really an alcoholic in real life like he just been hiding this,0.4794013
whole time from all of us because the way that he was like moving talking,0.09550932
I say Bradley are you okay like did you really get drunk I'm scared for,0.320302
you okay so I thought that his performance is very convincing and I thought Lady,0.19349602
Gaga was great as well um even the cinematography there's a scene like when they,0.11000198
first meet in the beginning of the film and he kind of touches her face,0.19673772
and then how the camera shoots to like her eyes so you can kind of,0.649903
is almost like I could feel him touching my face I wish he was touching,0.7542231
my face but he wasn't touching my face but I thought that parts of this,0.4788822
movie was beautifully shot especially the performance scenes like it felt like I was watching,0.12918599
like one of those backs backstage you know how to do like behind the music,0.115038924
or behind the concert or something I felt like I was right there with them,0.0873573
and so I think that Bradley Cooper was very smart for choosing a star is,0.11382356
born I think they made this relevant to the times today I think that he,0.07961915
even upped the ante of things that happen in this film versus the 1976 version,0.07530356
but I think that Lady Gaga is just she's lovely to watch on screen was,0.13969073
she singing like you just feel everything I know that they both helped write the,0.094055064
songs they co-wrote the songs with one another and I was saying like if I,0.060076565
had to say some of the things that kind of let me down was I,0.1337551
almost feel as though I didn't read any reviews going into this movie but I,0.053735685
was just looking at social media reactions from people who I follow on my timeline,0.08177742
and I felt as though because they hyped it up so much that like my,0.102489434
bar was set to another level going into the movie which is why I kind,0.13483135
of felt like is this with the fuss like what was the fuss all about,0.10326881
like what was everyone having a damn heart attack over and it doesn't take away,0.6339807
this is a very good movie I think that anyone who goes to see this,0.1024017
movie I think that they will really enjoy it it's a love story it hits,0.087456845
hips on drug addiction or alcoholism even codependency on one another in a relationship and,0.1322429
I would have to say that this movie Islam there's only like two hundred fifteen,0.42705736
minutes and it felt like three hours at one point I was like y'all can,0.09794653
you hurry up and wrap this up because I'm starting to get a little bored,0.25665462
and I feel as though that I wanted to see a little bit more into,0.12297915
Ali's background through conversations you kind of learn about Jackson's demons it kind of what,0.33057547
has led him into this downward Aspire of drugs and alcohol but I wish they,0.2738903
kind of would have talked about it or showed it a little bit more and,0.08208031
I wanted to learn even more about Ali and I almost made me feel as,0.14831445
though I was watching a one-sided story kind of from his point of view on,0.055453487
how their relationship was instead of seeing like how she felt I felt like some,0.081099145
how they had to react to certain things in the film just wasn't really realistic,0.066240594
she almost just never worried she never expressed how she felt about me it was,0.18471165
always about Jackson and making sure that he was okay so I just kind of,0.0898299
wanted to see the other side internally like how does she really feel about where,0.067552984
the relationship was going especially as she's being catapulted into Fame and how she was,0.097072646
dealing with both of those at the same time but overall I would still say,0.06860798
pay to go see this film in theaters I'm not sure about how I feel,0.101240024
about saying that this is gonna be like oscar-nominated I think is gonna have a,0.052916363
lot of buzz and I have a lot of popularity especially with the music so,0.060670808
I would definitely tell you how to go ahead and go download the damn soundtrack,0.7918359
I already downloaded shallow because this song was hidden but I would have to wait,0.19090658
to see all the movies that are coming out during Oscar season to really say,0.053458817
like okay like they better get an Oscar nomination I just don't know right now,0.14669639
I'm on the fence but as always those are my thoughts on the star is,0.066471085
