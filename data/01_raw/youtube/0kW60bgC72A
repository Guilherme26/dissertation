oh my the liberties taken with the Marvel Thor mythology I was very surprised but I guess when you've made over 12 billion at the box office this Kevin Feige has done wow that's quite a that's quite a feat he's a Hollywood superhero you can do whatever you want and it does saddened me to some degree to see the comics become the cart rather than the horse when it comes to these characters but that said I did feel it many times while I was watching this movie from the very opening scene that I was reading not just a Thor comic but a very good Thor comic and while Warner Brothers is trying to learn Taika Waititi away as we speak for a live-action akira which I totally get by the way many times during the film when I didn't feel like I was reading a Thor comic well just really on the planets a car basically but for the four fleeting moments I was like a live-action Akira oh there it is again I mean he's kind of in some ways already done the groundwork for it but I would really like to see Tyco with TD stick with Thor as I think he'd do a fabulous job exploring the nine realms and all its fantastical elements like frost giants light and dark elves etc I already said oh my when I opened this review but if you're reading the current Jason Aaron run on thor ragnarok with rustled ottomans artwork shout out to wrestle daughter min the artist on my my own comic super via but I think Taika Waititi would do a fabulous job bringing that that very colorful fantasy stuff to the big screen which is kind of to some degree what he's done here now this is a non-spoiler review and I was again genuinely surprised a handful of times while watching the movie and I think that it was a mistake for Disney Marvel to release this film across the globe and what's essentially a two-week rollout that's such a slow rollout because I feel that without the surprises this film is going to seem weaker than it is and the surprises are too big too important too well I think that what's really without giving them away what's really a big deal about them is what they're going to impact there gonna have on the MCU going forward so there's no way that you're gonna be able to avoid them I mean good luck to you but it's just not gonna happen I mean I already went in as early as I did knowing some stuff particularly about the end credits sequences which you know really are known on and credit sequences and I would I wish that I had not known even that and it did lessen the impact for me so good luck to you and Marvel Marvel and Disney really shouldn't have put you in that position now why would thor ragnarok seem weaker without it surprises well that's because Taika Waititi is still growing as a filmmaker what have you correctly interpreted my emoji pre-review right when i got out of the theater and that's the thor ragnarok is a colorful funny party with good music it's like the first guardians of the galaxy and I'm very specific with that distinction the first over the second and I'll explain that in just a moment but the very first trailer for Thor Ragnarok which rocked the world made the movie seemed a little grander a little more epic a little more revolutionary than it actually is I mean when Kevin Feige said he was gonna take more cues from James Gunn I had no idea that meant he was basically gonna duplicate James Gunn and if Taika Waititi is indeed following in James Gunn's footsteps and that means there's a knock out emotional moment like with yondu and volume 2 on the horizon for him but it's not in this movie there is a difference by the way I want to clarify between James Gunn and Tycho with TT James Gunn is more lowbrow frat boy humor whereas Tycho with TD is more quirky highbrow humor which I prefer so that's why I like this I like this much better than the first guardians of the galaxy although that was a huge hit so I'd be curious to see how this one comes across now again this is a colorful party with good music and I wore this shirt by the way intentionally for this review because I feel this is this would fit in with the movie very well right it's a big bright loud pig shirt that's fun to wear but I would like to add to that description cuz the more I thought about it what I'd like to add to that is it is a colorful fun funny party with good music and good friends that's a really important distinction that is something I did not expect in the film that was a really pleasant surprise and that's the camaraderie I mean we're sixteen movies and a decade and at this point when it comes to the MCU Wow and the tremendous payoff there which I only notice with this movie Taika Waititi is the first to do something with it and that is the depth of the relationships that have developed between these characters the shorthand that has developed what they still don't know each about each other which is very telling and also their relationships with us all of those things seem very real in this movie for instance they're some of the quieter moments in the movie particularly when Thor and banner catch up really you know that was the closest this movie came to kind of like emotionally hitting me and the more I let it wash over me the more of an impact it kind of makes I think this you know I wonder how this movie would do with repeat viewing I want to see it again it could actually you know I think maybe I think it's just a fun as I said a fun party who doesn't want to spend more time at a party but these little moments do shine and I think that I wish that Captain America Civil War had had had a better grasp of this because that was supposed to be a whole newly about relationships these specific relationships but perhaps the problem there is that that will be focused on the - that's right - most self-involved members of the team Steve and Tony Steve is very self-centered and so seeing the Avengers not only as a team but as an experience through the eyes of Thor and Bruce that was fascinating and I'm telling you that yondu moment is coming for Taika Waititi if he could do that here you know what he did achieve now another reason that Taika Waititi has to stay is that I didn't get it off of anything the movie goes by very quickly at a very fast clip and it has a huge cast and so I could have used more time with each and every character in fact it really is two movies as many of us suspected I would have preferred that they had had an entire movie about hella and an entire movie about Planet Hulk it's Planet Hulk and I almost you know I felt I'm sure Hulk fans will feel feel it right here if you want to you're gonna have an emotional moment when you see Hulk you know perhaps his greatest storyline taken away from him and given to Thor and also stripped of a lot of the emotional heft and seriousness of that story but you know it still it was good you know I think considering the problems with the universal situation and a Hulk movie could only be distributed through them this is the best we're gonna do but and I would like both those movies to be directed by Tyco over TD so again because no spoilers here are my quick impressions of the top characters in the movie Chris Hemsworth as Thor I've always said when I especially you know right after the last Avengers movie I was like you know age of Ultron I say Whedon gets it he's the only one who gets it the strength of both Chris Hemsworth in Thor is comedy well Tycho would Tina gets it too and it makes such a difference I mean he's here the character is finally realized to a degree that allows him to stand shoulder to shoulder with cap and Tony cap and Iron Man the way they were supposed to in the very first Avengers movie Thor is always lagged behind boy did I have fun watching him fly with me on earth that was just a side note that was a great no saw some great moments but you know again you know truly realized on the silver screen finally a cate blanchett as hella it was such a joy to see a female character with not only so much raw power but who wasn't afraid or ashamed or hesitant even to use it it was so great if I was going and cost you this year for Halloween I totally go as hell up just the way she walked into a room and owned it just the way she forget face acting Kate Blanchet does I acting it's amazing I hope she's part of the MCU for a long long time Jeff Goldblum as the grand master one does Jeff Goldblum not improve a movie although even more impressive was that there were a couple of times here where he didn't just seem like space Jeff Goldblum but he actually blended in with the movie that was pretty neat Mark Ruffalo is the Hulk I'm sad to tell you that you've seen most of his role in the trailers and the clips that doesn't make it any less fun but I would have preferred more I mean he has actually pretty small role in the movie and I'm getting pretty tired of his almost relationships Banner you tease and then Tisa Thompson as Valkyrie she did as much as possible and makes quite an impression with what is a very underwritten role and as it's presented here quite frankly unnecessary some of you have asked me about that her her saying that Valkyrie is bisexual in the movie no she's not it was never hinted at once and I don't know why she would say that it just it distracted a little bit from her character actually to be honest with you because she kept waiting for that other shoe to drop and it never did so in some ways she didn't feel fully realized because Tisa Thompson put that out there I will talk about all of them and everyone else in the movie more in the spoiler review but finally the last thing I want to talk about here is the score which I just purchased it's so good by Mark Mothersbaugh it was one of my favorite things about the movie in fact that I can talk about in the non-spoiler review and it's the perfect fit for I wrote this down very specifically for a quirky offbeat sci-fi fantasy that wears it's hard on its sleeve downs me to buy the very large mug and laughs with a glimmer in its eye as it Pat's you heartily on the back while telling a good story that's what the score is like that's exactly what the new Thor is like and what his new movie is like and it's perfect I actually do feel that this movie could be captured in the in the glimmer and Chris Hemsworth's eye it's perfect so I highly recommend thor ragnarok just realize the stage at which this movie is in and also with the stage title with TD is in as a storyteller I'll get there but this is very very promising it is one of the most entertaining MCU films I've ever seen and I really I hope that Kevin Feige can hang on to Taika Waititi and that the Thor trilogy starts here this just seemed like a fresh start for the character and I would hate for this to be where he I mean if he has to go out on this note with in terms of his solo movies fine but I can't you know speaking of cap and Iron Man of the three of them no one deserves another movie more that I think Thor I was very very happy with it I want to see what Taika Waititi does next specifically with these characters so that's my non-spoiler review for Thor Ragnarok leave your own thoughts about the movie down below please don't put any spoilers please let's try and do our best even if Disney Marvel did not alright so again write those thoughts down
