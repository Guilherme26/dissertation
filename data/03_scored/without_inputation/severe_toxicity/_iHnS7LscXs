hey guys so I feel like I haven't filmed in like a million years just,0.02404639
plethora of reasons and I apologize this video is so late I actually saw this,0.06479687
movie really late I saw it like five or six days after it was even,0.021011155
released so but we're here now we're doing the review now I hope that you,0.04917836
will still be interested at this point hopefully you've seen the movie because most of,0.027419535
this video is going to be all about the spoilers and just the movie in,0.092958085
general and like the theories the just you know the details about the film because,0.011798362
it's really hard to review it without spoilers but there will be a chunk at,0.022941519
the beginning of this video where I do review it if you have yet to,0.04028951
see it whether or not I recommend it also I just wanna say today's makeup,0.040999923
is inspired by the movie so apparently all you have to do to look a,0.027251909
little bit more jarring is to remove your eyebrows so I'm rocking my natural eyebrows,0.4581027
today also another thing I got new glasses so you're gonna see me rocking some,0.05666367
glasses a lot more in videos and last thing I want to talk about before,0.0653197
we get into the review is you might have seen a bunch of other horror,0.09019823
creators talk about this and I'm really late to jump on this bandwagon but I,0.044872623
did really want to mention it because it's so exciting and I'm so pumped about,0.029735705
it it's currently an 80s horror documentary project that's being created right now and is,0.03884606
being funded on IndieGoGo I will have a link to it down below it's called,0.04904931
in search of darkness and it's backed by people like John Carpenter Elvira just back,0.03965625
to today painting hotter and a plethora of other horror icons in this community but,0.06334744
I'm so excited because we get a true thorough 80s horror documentary which i think,0.1318108
is one of the best decades for horror and arguably one of the most important,0.042128075
decades of horror today is actually the last day to back it I know I,0.052604053
apologize I'm so late on announcing this but hopefully you've seen other creators talk about,0.040684626
it and you've already backed it and gotten the perks but I will have a,0.033822592
link of course and I'm not sponsored to say that by the way it isn't,0.012041819
affiliate link though I do want to disclose that so now let's get into the,0.02846986
us review there is so much to unpack with this movie and I can tell,0.039625656
you right now I'm not going to cover every single detail every twist and every,0.05766344
sim aspect of symbolism in the spell there's just no way that I can get,0.028609548
into that so I'm gonna talk about my favorite things about the film and my,0.03246429
favorite kind of forms of symbolism and commentary and things like that so just gonna,0.044772845
go over the ones that I find the most interesting about the film but of,0.02004664
course there's going to be literally so many more things about this and there's so,0.022040196
many videos already made about all the things little easter eggs within this movie that,0.04241477
you can check out and also just do a google search and you there's tons,0.042748027
of articles about it so if you want more details definitely research a little bit,0.03297781
more but I'm gonna share with you my opinion about the film and my thoughts,0.03674408
actually went in with a little bit of a smaller expectation I tried to go,0.045202553
in with 0 because it's it was a little bit risky I it looked really,0.046254877
good right the trailer I think undeniably looked decent it definitely isn't really what the,0.019584337
movies about I'll tell you that but because get out created by Jordan Peele of,0.027933722
course was so well received in the horror community although some would argue it's not,0.03934295
a true horror film and you know there are a lot of people that didn't,0.055280752
actually like get out but I think in general it was well-received so I didn't,0.023585416
want to hype up this movie too much because although I was excited I was,0.05625591
worried it wasn't going to live up to the hype because we've only ever seen,0.05374085
get out from Jordan peels so we were like is he a one-hit wonder is,0.07064317
he gonna be able to like make a name for himself as a horror creator,0.072492376
so short answer does us live up to its hype and live up to get,0.02535281
out and the Jordan Peele name absolutely now after I saw the trailer of course,0.023695838
I was excited but I was worried because it looked kind of like I was,0.02414284
worried it was gonna be what you see is what you get and it was,0.02094996
gonna be kind of a basic home invasion film with a twist the fact that,0.10562717
they were like twins or like they looked just like them it's us you know,0.04510943
there's also nervous going in because the trailer portrays it kind of like a home,0.019476578
invasion film and that's actually one of my least favorite horror genres they're just not,0.10597107
that terrifying to me with a few exceptions such as hush really loved hush but,0.12202994
generally they're not my favorite kind of movies because I just don't they're kind of,0.07454314
boring to me is that weird to say and without giving anything away or giving,0.040570214
away spoilers just yet I do want to say that this isn't really a home,0.028633496
invasion film I would not consider a home invasion movie so don't go into it,0.073591925
expecting a home invasion movie of course because it is a Jordan Peele movie and,0.06335076
he has just you know declared that his running theme within his movies and his,0.03642213
work will be social commentary what is the social comp well I'll get into the,0.013714091
specific of what the social commentary isn't spoilers because I don't want to ruin it,0.042612996
if you haven't seen it yet but of course there is social commentary in this,0.009802146
film and I do think that this movie did a much better job than get,0.039816562
out in being a standalone true horror film I feel like anyone can go into,0.0761183
this and enjoy it simply as a movie and as a horror movie versus get,0.07838192
out where it was kind of like more in-your-face social commentary is very much more,0.023040632
literal although there was smaller pieces of symbolism throughout it of course this movie can,0.044200122
definitely stand on its own without having the viewer have to think too hard about,0.078879476
the social commentary while you're watching it of course I was doing that so I'm,0.016143342
trying to put together the pieces and figure out what he's talking about but you,0.024308471
can enjoy this film without having to think too much about it because it's not,0.048716053
right in your face fully it's just a really good horror movie in itself and,0.27596188
then you have the underlying social commentary aspect along with it so in my opinion,0.036521908
I feel like that was a really successful portrayal of what he was trying to,0.017286127
say this scares in the movie I think were so effective and my job was,0.032000653
just on the floor sometimes like I I wasn't truly terrified like I wasn't shaking,0.041093715
in my chair or anything I tend to not do that anyway with most horror,0.07710742
movies I feel like I'm a little bit more desensitized but it was truly terrifying,0.049467713
like there were moments that were horrific and scary at least to me as far,0.043630727
as criticism obviously I've been hyping it up a lot and I do have criticism,0.012792812
of this film obviously if you look too deep into things and specifics a lot,0.068305045
of the underlying symbolisms and things that he's trying to reach for sometimes they don't,0.013882383
make sense and they wouldn't be realistic in the real world granted it's not it's,0.029576726
a movie so I feel like we can kind of forgive some of the smaller,0.040592168
inconsistencies or imperfections within the movie because after all it is about the symbolism while,0.027283173
still maintaining the atmosphere of a horror movie so you have to be able to,0.047989007
kind of look past those smaller things that just don't make sense or don't really,0.017848207
add up I think it's a given for me to say that the acting was,0.0350299
OnPoint like amazing the visuals were great only had really one or two issues with,0.08927297
it and those I'll get into more in the spoiler section although I don't really,0.027394922
consider them too spoilery but there's two scenes that I feel like we could have,0.043717865
just deleted and it would have been better another thing I want to say is,0.021856604
that Jordan Peele has like a really good eye for detail and literally everything in,0.037787754
the film paid off in the end like everything you know had significance later on,0.020313378
any time we saw something happen or an item or something it had meaning later,0.052085876
on in the film and that's so satisfying as a viewer to have that kind,0.032897986
of payoff for everything that we're taking in it all comes back together I felt,0.08242158
that the explanation for the whole movie and the plot and everything is just enough,0.015798777
I feel like it might have been a little spoon fed to the viewer and,0.076790795
I usually hate that but in the moment it didn't feel like it but maybe,0.052024677
it's explained in a way that some people would find a little spoon fed because,0.030138806
the viewer vent is not left to come to their own conclusions about the film,0.022032212
and about the symbolism and commentary and everything like that but I think had we,0.019569037
not had the type of explanation that we did there's a certain scene where things,0.034129243
are like rounded out and like explained more in depth if we hadn't had that,0.016990786
I feel like there would be than those people that are like what is going,0.07504402
what is the reason for this why is that happening okay so with that general,0.038296618
review obviously I really enjoyed the film I really loved it and I'm actually going,0.031537686
to go see it again on my anniversary on Tuesday my boyfriend are gonna go,0.09761903
watch it again because we want to go in with knowing the whole film watching,0.01522938
it from the beginning again so I do recommend it I think it's amazing I'm,0.028836377
gonna get into spoilers now and pretty much the rest of the movie like the,0.04362873
whole movie the entire movie - and talk about my favorite pieces of commentary and,0.04925685
symbolism and little Easter eggs and things that I liked about it obviously like I,0.1452096
said it's not gonna be all of it I'm not gonna unpack all of that,0.062664956
stuff so yeah spoilers ahead talking about the whole rest of the movie the ending,0.06398335
the twist everything like that so you haven't seen it yet I do not recommend,0.033094883
continuing continuing to watch this video because it'll ruin it for you just go watch,0.13598083
it just go see it you need to see it in theatres and experience it,0.03669552
so the first thing I'm going to talk about is actually the social commentary part,0.012021199
of the film I think by now the social commentary aspect at the film is,0.0064669154
pretty obvious there are a bunch of other theories floating around my boyfriend and I,0.16205603
figured it out on the drive home and like piece together all the things that,0.02363331
reinforce the theory basically it's about the class system in America the issue of homelessness,0.064752966
the lower class middle class and upper class are all represented within the movie we,0.024740841
have the lower class of the untethered Underground we have the middle class of the,0.09843853
Wilsons the main family and then we have the upper class which is represented by,0.007990186
the Tyler family who seems to always have like similar things to the middle class,0.042899024
but like better you know also the title the movie us could quite literally mean,0.039628983
us also the charity that has talked about a lot in the film Hands Across,0.020289432
America is you know commentary on the charities and things that are ineffective in the,0.08925368
United States that are there for homelessness but Hands Across America was actually a real,0.068450056
charity that was attempted and failed pretty much a lot of the donations and things,0.035893973
didn't end up going to the homeless because they had a lot of overhead costs,0.013483273
and stuff so it ended up not being beneficial to the lower class or homelessness,0.15750085
in America I really loved that social commentary that's something that's definitely important and a,0.012214102
huge issue but I'm really happy he went this route with dealing with the lower-class,0.059295136
and representing them in the movie and using certain symbolism to show that they were,0.056472097
lower-class apparently the lower-class don't have eyebrows so but you know their appearance is a,0.038512804
whole part of them being the lower class in that thing look kind of more,0.09920017
sickly because the lower-class in America doesn't have the best access to health care let's,0.28284505
go ahead and talk about the big twist the reveal in the end that red,0.03833919
is actually the real Adelaide when she wandered off as a little girl at the,0.119592704
fair and she ran into her untethered down below was strangled the untethered actually switched,0.14660048
places with her and now they lived above ground and forced the real Adelaide to,0.04848856
live underground with the untether to me this is horrifying in so many ways like,0.11991465
I just could not stop thinking about the fact that this real human child grew,0.13498172
up for like what 20 30 years underground I don't know how old she is,0.07150591
but she has two kids grew up in this underground area that's totally uncomfortable they,0.03909617
ate raw rabbits they had to mimic the people that they were tethered to on,0.23337428
the ground I don't know above that for that long though she I mean that's,0.04881849
like a new kind of torture am i right and then when you learn that,0.32048512
and you think back to when she is like talking to who we think is,0.038625885
the real Adelaide and her voice which will get into her voice because I don't,0.0961656
know why they're serious about it it's obvious but we'll get into the voice but,0.014616081
she's like talking to her saying like well you got food I had a raw,0.13433783
rabbits and you got toys and I had to play with sharp shiny things and,0.054358806
it's just so in hindsight that twist to me seems so obvious anyone else I,0.052196294
don't know if anyone caught it I didn't catch it at all I don't know,0.032729696
why because looking back it's like oh obviously that happened like that of course that,0.027785387
would be a plot point in this story but I didn't catch it so was,0.013319638
it successful you tell me did you catch it before they revealed it Jordan Peele,0.05110074
embedded so many things into the movie that was supposed to lead us to this,0.03107605
revelation you know she only drinks water she's eating strawberries while her family is eating,0.05104686
chicken her friend offers her a rose a and she's like I'm good with water,0.11239941
she only drinks water Pepe what do you do and there's these little moments that,0.02913571
you back and realize that Jordan Peele was telling this to us all along there's,0.021559266
theories out there that people believe that Jason which is the boy is also had,0.026560118
also switched with his tethered and he and they have like evidence behind it I,0.115865014
just don't believe that theory if it is true it's definitely not as obvious as,0.020133113
red and Adelaide is I think it's been confirmed or anything but I just I,0.048364837
don't believe that theory personally so the next thing I want to talk about is,0.023477657
her voice and I wasn't really gonna get into this other than mentioning it was,0.10831252
fantastic and as soon as she started talking I got goose bumps like I got,0.08091959
chills because I was scared like I could not imagine that in real life and,0.068207264
I saw some discussion actually on Twitter of what causes her to talk like this,0.044672403
which I thought was obvious but some believe that they're not used to breathing the,0.07803336
air above ground but if that was the case then other people could talk there's,0.033068273
a reason why only red can talk and then some other people said that her,0.04118551
voice is like that because she was strangled as a child realistically the real tethered,0.33374822
people don't have a voice which is a symbol of the lower-class not having a,0.058681834
voice in America and that's you know done on purpose there's a reason why she,0.028960101
can talk it's because she's actually a real human that was switched with her tethered,0.08391358
long ago and she has not been able to use her boys or hasn't you,0.082247294
know no one else she's surrounded by uses their voice so she's not communicating like,0.050404955
you would in the real world also there's the fact that Lupita and the yong-go,0.07254094
mimicked her voice to create this like scary voice she mimicked dysphonia which is a,0.2887938
brain disorder that causes speech to become like that which tells me it's more accurate,0.12386984
that she had just not used her voice for so long instead of being strangled,0.35266605
because I feel like if it was about her being strangled she wouldn't have mimicked,0.18225765
a brain disorder okay now that I've raved about this movie for so long and,0.2226097
talked to old about about the theories can I talk today did you hear that,0.010737394
I'm gonna get into a couple things that I didn't like about the movie which,0.06229312
isn't a lot but I did find some things that I just didn't like about,0.01325844
it so to start the very first frame of the and the very last frame,0.02745213
of the movie I could have done completely without the first frame is actually text,0.03139733
explaining that there are miles of unused tunnels across America and now I feel like,0.02700313
this is added to explain to the viewer that this is happening all over America,0.03776048
and so we understand it not just California and Santa Cruz it is all over,0.06464853
the United States what if you figure out the deeper meaning of the social commentary,0.038917236
aspect of this movie though you understand that it's about all of America it's not,0.07409747
just California I think that's obvious please don't he's being so rambunctious right now when,0.08994746
I'm trying to film a video to me it's just obvious that it's nationwide because,0.041973088
homelessness is an issue nationwide so of course we don't need the tunnel common you,0.118682735
know comment to tell us though it's all over America I don't know why else,0.047202762
that thing would be there it was definitely very confusing that it started off that,0.016111413
way cuz I was like what do you what because then I was anticipating tunnels,0.06502436
did it come out and I'm like okay so it's not a home invasion like,0.09551505
I knew that right off of that because they put this text screen on there,0.034500416
and then on top of that when she goes to the mirror the house of,0.02458053
mirrors situation towards the end you realize oh the tunnels so I wasn't surprised when,0.04786728
she started going down on an escalator where I feel like that scene would have,0.092615515
been so much more powerful and terrifying had I not known it was about tunnels,0.03390574
at all so the very last scene of the film is actually a wide shot,0.038186863
showing the tethered people holding hands there's like a string of people along the mountains,0.117490724
and then he sees some helicopters it was really the helicopters that I didn't like,0.02406302
being there because I feel like it would have been much more of a jarring,0.020725127
image if it was just the tethered because then you don't really know the severity,0.036162045
of the situation but given that there are still people alive in the helicopters and,0.05180251
obviously like are trying to figure out situation to me it kind of takes away,0.056613114
the eeriness and the unsettling ness of the tether taking over because there are still,0.045668848
people alive which of course there are it's still early on it's not like all,0.100934304
of America's dead now and they're the last living family but I still wish we,0.32089883
didn't see the helicopters or even just the last scene although I really liked the,0.021982988
image of them going for like miles that looked like also I really liked the,0.032257415
fact that they killed their tethered by stabbing them with a pair of scissors and,0.66653764
the throat hence taking away their voice kind of in the voice box too you,0.24872527
know because they don't have a voice delete the scissors themselves our symbol because it's,0.05084797
two parts two halves that are symmetrical there's just so much there's so many details,0.032733023
little fine things like that that you can google and look up all of them,0.043734495
the ultimate question is is this better than get out now I hate asking that,0.08875545
because we don't need to compare them they are two individual separate films but we're,0.031361412
gonna compare it like you have to compare them it's his only two movies so,0.06527115
of course you want to know if he's getting better or if he's getting worse,0.06880992
so I'd love to hear what your thoughts are about if it's better then get,0.029910648
out my thoughts yes I think it is better because it can stand alone as,0.055639286
a horror movie and I do believe that us is more of a true horror,0.09181064
movie and get out as kind of more alert I would argue that it's better,0.07293938
than get out and it definitely shows that Jordan Peele is no one-hit wonder I,0.034364052
am so excited that he is coming into the horror community when he is and,0.09744342
doing these social commentary horror movies because I think it's something it's like a whole,0.07359658
new genre and I think it's something the horror community really needed because right now,0.039955586
all we seem to be focused on our remakes sequels and like making movies out,0.048602972
of things that are already done or like books you know like stories that aren't,0.017649317
original there aren't a lot of original horror movies coming out lately there's a handful,0.047126267
of course you could argue that there's a handful here and there but we are,0.019126026
in the era of remakes so to see these original ideas come forth and be,0.029771624
done really well I think is so exciting and I can't wait for Twilight Zone,0.057398695
and to see what he does with that so of course I want this to,0.029803554
be more of a conversation between you and I and you and all of you,0.10227664
together I want to hear your thoughts I know some people didn't like this film,0.08147302
which is hard to believe for me because I loved the movie so much -,0.040694606
the issues I had that that goes with any movie so I want to hear,0.029794905
your thoughts if you didn't like it especially I want to know what was it,0.06823454
about it that you just didn't like so leave all that down below I hope,0.24661879
