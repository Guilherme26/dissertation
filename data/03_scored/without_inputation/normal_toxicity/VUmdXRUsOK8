I love this film and so did audiences Hepburn's risky move paid off handsomely when the film went on to box-office glory and Hepburn became a Hollywood legend the 1940 variety review proclaimed Hepburn doesn't play in the Philadelphia Story she is the Philadelphia Story I told you earlier that Hepburn's character was based on a real-life socialite who was renowned for her extravagant parties well the studio apparently wanted to film on her family's 800 acre estate however when they scouted the mansion and the grounds they decided the average American would never believe that anyone lived in such opulence and opted for a toned down version besides being a box-office hit the comedy was also a critical darling earning six Academy Award nominations and taking home two Oscars one for Best Screenplay and the other for Jimmy Stewart's best actor according to lore Stewart didn't think he had a chance of winning and wasn't even planning on attending,0.06383372
