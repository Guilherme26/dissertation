howdy,0.05207274
so after a rough week and we're not even going to get into that I decided yesterday to go with my wife to see the movie arrival at the theater down in Syracuse,0.124460116
and I want to give basically a quick review about it,0.05955204
you know,0.07163658
it's not the movie I thought I was going to see when I saw the previews and saw that it was going to be aliens and such I thought wow this is going to be really cool because I love aliens,0.11179488
so we went we went to a matinee showing of it,0.076565206
and they don't have it in 3d or imax and initially I wondered why,0.0629576
and now I know why since I saw the movie anyway it stars Amy Adams and jeremy renner and Forest Whitaker and in essence aliens have come to visit earth and they're spread out over the earth in 12 different locations not in major cities,0.10284151
but in just 12 locations and we're trying to find out why and Forest Whitaker plays a captain I believe who goes in scouts Amy Adams character who happens to be a language expert to try to get her to come and help them figure out how to communicate with the aliens to find out why they're there,0.06586787
and that's basically in the entire movie in essence,0.10000687
they've got the same thing going on in all the other locations,0.0803206
so everyone is trying to find you know their own way of communicating,0.08086525
and she turns out to do the best job of it she's able to figure out that they use certain symbols that look like smoke to communicate and she's able to figure out what the words and meanings mean she takes some risks in order to get there,0.09410717
and of course that that was kind of cool to see and it was really neat,0.08740832
it was visually a very nice movie,0.075595215
I have to tell you that I'm not sure about everything else the aliens okay I'm just going to say the aliens will remind you of the hand character from The Addams Family,0.09082753
that's the best I got but still I like the movie and you know she does figure out the language and she figures out the meaning and she figures out why they there,0.050270446
and I've seen some other reviews where folks are saying okay I'm confused,0.055720605
I don't really understand everything that's going on,0.09653135
and I'm not going to tell you everything because I met those you know I'm not the guy who wants to really spoil it for everybody,0.15387861
but what I am going to tell you is that you have to pay attention to everything,0.14255917
that's being said in essence,0.088476345
think about time time for us basically says you're born you go through your life you age,0.31089434
and then a certain point you expire well quantum physics basically says that time is a constant there is no beginning there is no end in essence,0.14774361
time is always the same so the beginning middle and end of time is all happening at the exact same time,0.0632146
so that's a very important aspect to try to figure out in this movie,0.07122561
and once you kind of understand that then the rest of the movie starts to make sense with everything,0.089218445
that's going on whereas,0.04625855
she gained some insight,0.24439977
she gained some insight,0.24439985
there's something that the aliens are going to do that no one wants me,0.15443958
Oh some people might say well wait how did they know to do that well because of time I think and I don't want to give it away,0.092279635
so what i am gonna say is amy adams you know what that woman is a stunning woman itch,0.48675126
i have liked everything I've ever seen her in I have not seen everything she's ever done because I don't usually chase actors into movies I will you know if a movie seems to catch my attention then I'll go see it,0.093459465
but she's been solid and everything I've ever seen her in Jeremy Renner was a little bit different than what I expected,0.15473998
you know I'm used to him being kind of bold and kind of smug,0.47690433
and in this movie,0.0834065
he's supposed to be a dwell,0.105271615
he's supposed to be a genius guy,0.084130384
and he's got a little bit of smugness but he really plays a much secondary character and I have to say that for once they really let a woman run the movie and i love that forest whitaker's character was really interesting,0.121830285
because if it had benefit for the fact that we know what Forest Whitaker looks like when you hear his voice you're like okay,0.15183894
what's he trying to affect you know,0.08387237
what is that voice,0.072619446
it's not like that strong Forest Whitaker voice that were used to but it's still Forest Whitaker everyone in essence played their roles the way I would expect that we would do that in real life especially if you have aliens all around the world and you have different countries with different cultures deciding that maybe they have to do something different than what someone else might say,0.1042067
and if you're not communicating information with everybody you know things will start to happen or possibly happen,0.24220048
so like I said I thought that this movie was pretty cool,0.077085316
if you're looking for a lot of action this ain't it,0.07663791
and truthfully I will tell you if this movie hadn't looked like there would be some kind of action or something I might not have ever gone but I'm glad I did,0.1204278
so this is a rival,0.09992505
and I hope it does well it's still going up against dr.,0.10744544
Strangelove and trolls trolls yet anyway still going up against those movies I liked it,0.5631645
my wife thought it was okay someone else who went with us thought it was okay and one other person,0.10735738
he didn't like it because he said he likes more action,0.11679682
hey you know what movies don't appeal to everybody but still I think this movie deserves to be seen I hope you go see it,0.15523888
I think it's worth it,0.11234824
I'm not going to say that you're going to have as good a time as i had at captain america civil war but i thought the movie was pretty good there are some times there where the movie kind of slows down a little bit,0.1889593
but it's interesting in the fact that you probably needed some of that to get an understanding of some of what was going on,0.05492791
and there's a lot of flashbacks in the movie that if you remember what I said about time,0.05595932
you will understand how come,0.18386428
they're there so that's all I got,0.06409536
I hope you all go see this movie,0.2839675
I hope you enjoy the movie when you see it,0.120232
and I hope this doesn't look as odd as it looks to me filming it while sitting on my livingroom couch you take care,0.15376878
