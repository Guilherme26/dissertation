and the Beast meets et it starts a woman named Sally Hawkins as the main character of Eliza it also stars other great talent like Octavia Spencer and Michael Shannon and Doug Jones as the creature in this monster movie so like I said Sally Hawkins plays a woman named Eliza Eliza is mute she can't speak she can't talk,0.2908788
she works at this top-secret government facility with her friend Octavia Spencer as a cleaner and one day a mysterious creature is brought into the facility watched over by Michael Shan Lysa develops a connection with this creature,0.19173487
she gets close to it,0.12591948
she eventually starts falling in love with this creature,0.3147896
and then she finds out that the creatures life might be in danger,0.1543087
so she has to figure out a way to work with her friends to protect this creature and help it escape from its prison in this facility,0.21864268
and Michael Shannon,0.055525273
well he's not gonna be too happy about that one thing,0.14459927
I've always loved about llamo del Toro and his films is his ability to visually paint a picture,0.101232514
I mean this dude is one of the greatest visual storytellers that I've ever seen guys a master class at subtly and visually laying it out for you,0.16203418
it's like a road map with filled with all kinds of emotion all kinds of subtext and all kinds of layers and visually you just got to see it with your eyes,0.102877505
I mean the is poetry on screen and this movie is no different because this is not only one of the best looking and gorgeous looking films of the entire year made a film that has a lot of visual subtext and a lot of visual storytelling that will go unnoticed unless you're actually paying attention,0.052567035
it's not enough to say that this movie is eggs on a tip beautiful,0.25450858
I mean,0.07710842
duh of course,0.118946746
it is Guillermo,0.0658544
del,0.017837785
Toro always has a beautiful looking movie,0.098404475
I like what he did with the lighting,0.10156386
and the contrasts in this film somehow it's a little bit more of a grounded reality in this film,0.10568078
it takes place in the 1960s,0.07167579
so it's not as much of a fantastical epic as you're used to seeing from guillermo del toro but somehow in a grounded fantasy it's still somehow manages to pop visually I'm not entirely sure how he and the cinematographer did that for this film,0.075680576
but kudos to both of those guys Foreman says in this film are so goddamn good that,0.7301269
I don't think it's enough for me to get out of this review and not say that every single one of the main principle characters and actors in this film need to be nominated for something give a damn if it's a Golden Globe,0.53490317
I don't give a damn if it's an Oscar,0.6673727
I don't care,0.2042832
if someone just draws a picture of a golden statue and a piece of paper and hands it to them and says you were awesome,0.31089434
because guess what everybody in this movie was freaking awesome Sally Hawkins was mesmerizing as the main character of Eliza,0.38243186
she doesn't say anything in the movie,0.111454256
she can't talk obviously because she's mute but her facial reactions and her eyes tell everything they tell the entire story all I can really say about her performance in this movie is that she moves mountains emotionally without saying a single word everyone else was really great in the movie to Octavia Spencer I mean she just adds something to every movie that she's in she has some very funny parts,0.1930559
she has some very welcome levity and human though she brought some humor,0.30446684
there's also some very touching and heartfelt moments with her character too,0.09570956
and I would say that her character just like most of the other characters in this film are trying to find themselves in someone else,0.08203266
they're trying to find some part of themselves trying to find something that they've lost within themselves and they're trying to see it reflected in someone else her character represents that too Jones is great as this amphibian sea creature,0.16448513
monster whatever the hell this thing is prosthetics,0.55327624
and the design of the creature are very well done,0.11224501
and Doug Jones does a lot of miming and a lot of hand movements and a lot of eye twitches and I decided to describe,0.11718397
and all I can know is that Doug Jones was great in this movie Michael Shannon,0.06295317
oh my god to do is just,0.050808575
I hate him in this movie,0.67196125
Michael Sata does such a great job at playing a great villain,0.24054806
we have seen that in other films that he's done,0.10878675
but in this movie in particular he was such a slimeball,0.55219704
oh my god I absolutely hated,0.47780815
Michael Shannon in this movie I hated him,0.40870985
I just I despised him at a cellular level,0.5154597
he was awful,0.53004056
he was disgusting,0.6300709
he made me sick to my stomach,0.49060458
but I I just I couldn't turn away from the screen while he was on it even though this is a film that seems like,0.07198818
it has a simple issue story to it it's a romance between a monster and a girl who can't speak it seems kind of simple,0.40316695
but there are so many layers and themes and subtext interwoven throughout the narrative of the script and the screenplay that just make this movie pop on a more emotional level and on a more so Libra level than your typical Beauty meets,0.13880767
the Beast type of story,0.19323291
there are some very subtle references in ways that the film brings up and addresses things that are not only prevalent in our society today,0.027887309
but we're also prevalent during that era in the 1960s there are some heavy themes about prejudice about judging somebody who's different than you,0.06607775
subconscious prejudices that we have about people,0.09073592
even what we don't say anything,0.072922416
it also says a lot about people with disabilities and the way we take people like that for granted and the way that sometimes not saying things is sometimes the most powerful statement that a person can make a real issue,0.090888545
with this movie is that the movie does hit a lull sometime between the second act,0.09646977
and the third act there's a point in the movie where the story is going along and then something happens,0.05086659
and then the story just kind of stops for a little bit,0.07594715
and there's a little bit of a lull,0.084207535
there's not much going on from a story perspective,0.0624889
it's not that the story comes to a crashing halt,0.11932472
it's just kind of like a plane circling overhead it's just it's it's hovering,0.104501456
it's not really going anywhere,0.07527104
there's a little nitpick is that I wish we had found out a little bit more about age sapien look at him look at the fish thing in this movie and tell me that that doesn't seem like,0.12992813
it's a prequel or whatever the it's supposed to be for ape Sapien from the Hellboy movies come on,0.25469357
I mean it's it's so obvious plus it's played by the same guy who was Abe Sapien in the Hellboy movies maybe I'm reaching but I don't think I am the shape of water is one of the most touching beautiful visually ematic Lee awesome movies that I have seen in 2017 this movie touched me and it touched me everywhere it touched me in my brain,0.2651848
it touched me in my heart all that said I am going to give the shape of water,0.37780827
