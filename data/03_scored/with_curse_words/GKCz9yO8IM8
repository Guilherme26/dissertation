you know to be straight up with you I almost drove like an hour on,0.29509932
my way to go see this film because literally this film was showing and one,0.0818728
theater near me which was by our our way and I can't believe yesterday was,0.12281442
Christmas that's nlgger insane but yeah because the day after it was so busy movie,0.53490317
it was it's chaos I've barely got a chance to see the film but I,0.06760964
did the shape of water the new newest film from Guillermo del Toro yeah and,0.06073867
I gotta say I really enjoyed this film I really did I there's a couple,0.12225276
garage side I have with this film but other than that I really really liked,0.066445656
this film this movie is it's very darkly cute and it's just so nlgger bizarrely,0.26711592
weird and just so just randomly just violent as nlgger and just jarring you know,0.4411378
for example the main character here let me bring up a quick quick image here,0.05775409
the the main character here who was doo doo doo doo doo beautifully played by,0.116967864
Sally Hawkins I'm not I'm not very familiar with her work but she is incredible,0.09653602
in this role why this is probably one of the most impressive female performances that's,0.11896549
seen all year okay she plays a mute she I mean she does speak but,0.10663785
like she kind of really doesn't but we'll get to that but mostly she really,0.12635352
never speaks in this nlgger film and she conveys so much to her body language,0.3386384
in through sign language it's just impressive I thought she was just terrific I thought,0.07471025
the whole cast was fine I don't know I mean I guess she would definitely,0.1260155
be the stand performance her and Doug Jones listen Doug Jones but but like the,0.075142324
whole cast well I take that back Doug Jones her and Michael Shannon those are,0.08124169
definitely the stanza the standouts everyone else acting-wise was completely convincing and they were just,0.05687053
fine but yeah she was incredible and Michael by the way by the way talking,0.09981874
about the movie ban jarring right when it was show like her daily routine like,0.11609164
when the first shows her again by completely naked getting into the bathtub and like,0.5464606
like like most of her day is cleaning and masturbating and just kinda like this,0.9218867
mundane life you know I was like what the nlgger what Del Toro's just one,0.46248734
of the strangest like when Michael Shannon was just just nlgger the nlgger out of,0.47128317
his chick right and he was like going to be quiet like whoa whoa just,0.5474461
del toral he just he'll just go left in the car if the car was,0.1906737
the plot it'll just go left abruptly just out of nlgger nowhere you know that,0.3506253
one character was his name I think his real-life name is Michaels the old barge,0.14883135
Burt I I don't know I probably still want another say his last name correctly,0.09440499
before making the review but this guy right here he places scientists but he plays,0.14104885
like such a respectable just straight-up honest good nlgger person I think it's character name,0.46401772
is mr. Robert Hoffman or some nlgger but my god I I loved his character,0.18335603
he was just like just such a good man nlgger rightfully so cared for this,0.36679545
nlgger man played by Doug Jones who again Doug Jones good good God I mean,0.48884952
Hellboy Pan's Labyrinth like one day he needs to receive him and Andy Serkis should,0.10612558
receive some kind of Lifetime Achievement Award nlgger because honest to god he is just,0.30545333
exceptional as his creature like the the the the blend of practical effects and CGI,0.24136825
but mostly just practical effects on his body is incredible like and his body language,0.28948948
as his creature so convincing like you just utterly believe that he is just this,0.4033735
nlgger what they call amphibian man like he truly believe that he is his fish,0.3960914
man like a hundred and ten percent back at the end creature looks real real,0.27698016
as nlgger and it should because I was looking at some behind-the-scenes stuff and just,0.1894769
look at this thing like the amount of practical effects with this creature is just,0.18062823
mind-blowing it's insane but even when he blinks you know I'm just like is that,0.31089434
CGI did they find a way to do that practical is it like a you,0.14999287
know both worlds woven into each other like what the nlgger it's just masterful work,0.559131
when it comes to the creature design and the sets as well I mean cinematography,0.1008785
is gorgeous it's definitely one of the best looking films of the year but actually,0.08763725
paused on the Scimitar ephie my god the opening leagoo big here for a second,0.11752672
because the opening tracking shot this opening moment right here which was done in one,0.08746013
take for the record okay well we're sort of wandering through this underwater house I'll,0.08205245
be honest with you I'll be straight up with you I'm not even entirely sure,0.31089434
whether this was practical or CG I'm assuming that this this shot must be a,0.11182462
combination of practical and CGI but I really don't nlgger know this whole goddamn sequence,0.83582246
could be totally practically done it could be a hundred percent real fall I know,0.06631495
I don't know I'm gonna say just because of how dreamlike it looks is a,0.109176375
blend of CGI and practical effects but either way the opening first sequence that's done,0.05479184
in one take or underwater going to zone house or interior of this room is,0.078842066
extraordinary good god some of the best semi tog Rafi here and throughout the film,0.06960338
I've seen all year it's it's very very impressive and also actually nlgger it we're,0.2397986
gonna go big one more time here the set design is particularly fantastic as well,0.0988145
like in this the place where Octavia Spencer and right Sally Hawkins right you have,0.08396467
the place where they work at as cleaning the women is just utterly fantastic with,0.44137037
the sense like the room that houses the amphibian man the nlgger fish guy where's,0.3236747
that oh yeah there it is it is just the attention to detail is just,0.05805175
remarkable you know it looks like just an actual place but I could go work,0.07615702
at tomorrow like it's it's nlgger insane and I know that the film takes place,0.52322644
I think in like out in 1962 or something like that but yeah really incredible,0.080367945
sets Michael Shannon is goddamn fantastic in this film probably one of my favorite villains,0.66264206
of the year he's just like this nlgger perfectionist bigoted just darkly hilarious Vilnius guy,0.5876557
you know like there's one scene where he's nlgger in the bathroom taking a piss,0.76813334
and this one nlgger literally it's just like literally taking a piss on the stall,0.69699794
just like this talking to Octavia dispenser and Sally Hawkins you know saying I was,0.08377105
like what a nlgger bat if you if you're just just openly conversating when someone,0.7907591
taking a piss like that you are the man okay what the nlgger this man,0.796128
had his his fingers written ripped off tried to have them put back on and,0.3368544
then later like we're Moo them from their attendance out what the nlgger this man,0.47300598
is nlgger insane um he was just such a perfect villain he was so good,0.6882249
there's one sequence where just general he was like he was talking to like some,0.06379012
some head guy some general Michael Shannon he was just like well you know if,0.11346193
I failed once you know me for 13 years if I failed one time I,0.14751051
mean they really make me a failure you know what done for you and there's,0.2552892
just like a certain look that Michael Shannon gave the general before the general started,0.05061421
talking again and also Jesus Christ I've never even seen that kind of body language,0.15835695
from Michael Shannon like this man is truly an exceptional actor it's just his acting,0.23265427
it's very nuanced it's very subtle you know it could be easy for someone to,0.07882201
be like I don't understand why is acting so great it's the little details and,0.10744643
there's mannerisms that make him so good um another thing that really liked is there's,0.07878066
a lot of small moments they actually meant something and it wasn't just random for,0.050774988
example when he's just just going ham you know having sex was with his chick,0.8436315
right it would be easy to dismiss that seeing us like the nlgger was that,0.24200892
nlgger dealt or outside the leak some of his sexual fantasies and to the family,0.6360764
that was was just Brandon nlgger but no because later on the film when he's,0.16522972
talking to Sally Hawkins and he's like so uh you know I like some of,0.21904542
you meets you know do you squawk you wanna know squawkers yeah I like living,0.31586814
to be quiet you know you know there's there's that connection there you know or,0.068199165
what what else there's just so many like when what's-his-name is it Richard Jenkins I,0.06499538
think it's his name really great after yeah Richard drink is shout out to that,0.13898754
man fantastic act I've been on been in all kinds of nlgger right there's a,0.35123277
scene where he crashes his car into Michael Shannon's new Cadillac I think it was,0.085562155
Cadillac but he crashes his car into the Michael Shannon's new new new vehicle that,0.06340697
he just bought right and when I was first watching this I was like come,0.08627891
on movie the dumbest thing you'll make the character do some of that dumb but,0.90074134
that Carly crash into just so happen to be Michael Shannon's car that was like,0.15375802
oh oh nice hey you sneaky movie you love nlgger that that's interested interested I,0.5154597
just a little details well that's more like a whole list other ones that I,0.06850526
couldn't think of but that type of stuff was cool um I guess oh and,0.06801683
this scene right here has got to be one of the battleship it's gotta be,0.08529097
one of the best scene transitions I've seen in a movie all goddamn here I've,0.7093121
never seen no nlgger like this well she's like she's touching into the window and,0.37663004
like we zoom in crazily to these nlgger water droplets I'm talking like zoom zoomed,0.27892098
in right and the way that it the cross fades into the next scene is,0.045141265
just brilliant a lot of really cool visual techniques going on in this film oh,0.06259916
stop the stream but what else what else can't say this was a really fantastic,0.1650237
film um I guess let's talk about let's talk about the flaws really quick cuz,0.085185595
there's just two main ones that held me back from really really loving this film,0.12663321
am I can people see me oh you can good alright so number one uh,0.11246842
well this one might be a nitpick perhaps blood maybe I'll talk to sell to,0.15867642
be a nitpick but I really didn't buy the fact that like just on site,0.071497105
as soon as she first was in the presence of the creature like here and,0.23967205
also during where's the sequence where she's standing before the creature for her for her,0.15326868
for her very first time right here as well you mean to tell me that,0.08193373
this guy damn character was never afraid what time that she's in this creatures presence,0.9017749
she was she showed like no substantial acts of fear just as like the whole,0.15533501
time she was like like I know it's like 1962 and maybe she's a maybe,0.19719665
just as a weird person but like it's like anybody seeing this creature for the,0.2733201
first time should be under to some goddammit sense like if I'm saying that goddamn,0.8489485
thing like that for the first time I Billy hey family got some promise in,0.05097665
there oh hey man hey what's that hey y'all what's that wait raise my paycheck,0.1101813
what's that nlgger yeah I mean like I would be happy pissing myself with fear,0.6623948
all right I just thought those kind of ridiculous um but I guess my biggest,0.5605375
gripe in this film would be the relationship between her and the this fish man,0.24008669
like I just don't think that they completely nailed this relationship between the creature and,0.13478139
her for me personally it is sweet it is cute but I felt like you,0.2532178
know by the time we get to the third act more she's trying to break,0.09190295
the creature out I feel like by that time I should have been like like,0.14965084
oh my god I hope they stayed together I hope nothing happens to him oh,0.097823024
nothing happens to the fish man and that that never happened like during a sequence,0.076074585
where Michael Shannon is torturing the speech of this fish man Oh like I felt,0.31089434
bad but I wasn't really that bothered you know like when I was watching Peter,0.16618106
Jackson's King Kong and when King Kong is being shot at in the third act,0.2836446
I mean I was almost like I'm almost in tears every time I see that,0.06180225
sequence and King Kong because Peter Jackson is such a masterful job and making King,0.13180065
Kong's it's so incredibly sympathetic and just totally nail the chemistry and relationship between Cohn,0.097748466
and Naomi Watts you know so by time I'm saying King Kong being hurt like,0.15288444
it's literally torturous look at the screen I didn't get that when the fish guy,0.08974411
who's being tortured I don't think that they really nailed the relationship personally you know,0.15240341
like it's almost like by the time we get to the third act and when,0.057266515
we got there like I kind of knew we were in the third act fish,0.102907345
guy in her like this first weakest link in the third act like but God,0.24207492
she like literally like has sex I mean it's implied but she like has sex,0.78351516
with the fish guy you know saying in like I like it you know it's,0.13675131
sweet but I just wish I had a deeper connection you know to watching them,0.059571058
on screen I wish I had more of an emotional response to watching them on,0.09905258
screen I'm saying because special dance third act when Michael Shannon just straight up literally,0.15537053
shoots the fish guy and shoots her you know I'm saying it was shocking but,0.72687656
it was it was just surprising because it was shocking and it wasn't shocking because,0.055736154
I was like oh no I just saw two characters that I've grown to love,0.052084282
for two hours he's shot it wasn't like that it's just like god damn I,0.8520145
got bleep del Toro did that nlgger good you know so yeah and unfortunately that's,0.42877665
like a big cog in the machine to not really like that much in the,0.111383274
film you know the relationship between her and fish guys so that was only real,0.15304397
main negative I think the relationship between the two could have been more better executed,0.34826055
I suppose other than that I'm feeling like a 9 yeah I'm nlgger 9 9,0.25567895
10 I mean the film is gorgeous looking the acting is stellar across the boards,0.07344215
the music was lovely you know I thought the writing was very good there was,0.07264285
definitely strict attention paid to these characters because each character was very distinctive I just,0.06719225
wish I could have nailed the relationship more see ya feelin like a 9 9,0.4379491
10 forth it's it's definitely probably del Toro's best film in a long long time,0.07409174
because crimson peak was like yeah oh yeah I loved like the final like 10,0.12375924
15 minutes but everything else besides looking visually gorgeous was just laying yeah Pacific Rim,0.20792504
was it just pure meant for me you know um yeah yeah this is definitely,0.08283096
his best film this far bow would you think yeah would you think about this,0.092223495
this thing let me know your thoughts down below and that's it I'm out I,0.25461262
thought oh I'm not if we make sure to smash that like button comment subscribe,0.19645466
all that jazz I'm gonna be laying up prepare to get bombarded by reviews because,0.1548938
I'm literally off work until 2018 so there's a lot coming at you there's some,0.0876087
