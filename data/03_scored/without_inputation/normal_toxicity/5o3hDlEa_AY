Roma is Mexican director of fonczek Warren's new film which chronicles a year in the life of a middle-class family in Mexico City from 1970 to 1971 first the positive things about roma,0.006025102
Roma is epic it is a gigantic and majestic film and it has to be seen in the cinema,0.067578405
this thumb was shot on the digital equivalent of 70 millimeter film which is just incredibly wide and big and just epic and watching Roma was really an epic and awesome experience cinema graphically this film had some beautiful and captivating moments due to the epic scope of the shooting format some bits were really beautiful and captivating in terms of staging and Scimitar fee and direction they were really awesome,0.12772775
like this party scene in particular,0.06460198
and another scene in the fields where the camera is panning some shots were very very beautiful,0.18655042
but not old alfonso cuar√≥n shot this film himself and the cinematography at certain parts was really beautiful as i just mentioned but it's mainly panning shots or static shots and it's really no Lubezki cinematography,0.22230066
so the cinematography isn't particularly incredible or innovative as Lubezki would shoot but some bits were really powerful and really beautiful apart from the epic nature of the film itself the other best thing about this film is the sound work,0.21976222
there's this one scene that happens in the ocean where the audience is just fully captivated and taken over by the incredible sound work of the waves and of the sea which makes that moment such a real and visceral and scary experience really really amazing sound work,0.062032003
roma is not entirely an autobiographical film the film is based on Afonso Korins childhood memories of Mexico City in 1970 and 71 and Fonzo had every last detail reconstructed to as it actually was in those years,0.0018773217
however there is one moment,0.050011743
I think it's the hospital moment but I'm not quite sure that apparently is actually um a digital special effect it wasn't actually built so it was digitally reconstructed but everything else is apparently real and actually reconstructed too as it was at that time Romo isn't fully an autobiographical film because although there are scenes with supposedly young Alfonso Cuaron but no child in this family is actually called Alfonso,0.056888178
so we just have to assume that one of the children is Alfonso,0.102454
so there aren't many scenes with a young Alfonso however the film's plot is really about the indian Servant of Alfonso's family and most of the film is about her story so because Romo is mainly about the story of this Indian servant except for Cleo which is her name we don't really connect that well to the rest of the family,0.126914
and it's really only Cleo who I actually connected with the other characters I sort of observed them from a distance really so my main problem I had with Romo is that the film itself is not that interesting,0.084909685
I mean it does captivate you and you want to keep watching,0.17865472
but just the story is not the most interesting ever but some bits cinema too graphically or narrative Lee were really powerful especially at the end,0.08186528
it's really powerful but overall as a full product,0.061202664
it's not that interesting of a film to watch in my opinion,0.15371914
one of the biggest faults of Romo was that it was shot,0.19378397
digitally Romo which is all based on memories should have been shot on film to have that warmth and that vintage magic feel which the film completely needed and it being digital it just felt cold had it been shot on film Romo would have been a completely different and breathtakingly beautiful experience,0.07769936
the Russian critic Anton Dolan compared this film to amarcord and said that it's as good as a Marc Ord for me that is not so where Mr,0.10027964
cord is fully perfect and brilliant in every way in every shot in every scene,0.26481155
Roma is really not like that Roma is just a film that contains great moments,0.09535079
but overall is not that amazing,0.12407671
so Roma has no time our court or even no murmur of the heart and no the squid and the Whale however it is closer to Louis Malle's aurevoir Ellis on phone in terms of power those movies are quite similar,0.063561656
so in my personal opinion Roma is not Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece his masterpiece remains children of men which is just absolutely perfect in every way,0.2685186
and one of the greatest things that the cinema has ever given us,0.053340983
so overall Roma is a great and epic product and a really interesting time capsule of Mexico City in 1970 and 71,0.046028145
thank you for watching,0.03569597
and see you next Friday,0.10044152
