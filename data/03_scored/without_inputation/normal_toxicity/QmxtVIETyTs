according to the library of congress the wizard of oz is the most watched movie of all time,0.072850615
which makes sense because it's over 80 years old was one of the first movies to be released in color and presents a timeless story with iconic characters and songs,0.021757362
it reminds me of the animated features that would be released by walt disney which is a reasonable comparison because this was made as a direct response to walt disney's snow white in the seven dwarfs for something that had production troubles and a less than stellar box office performance,0.0811853
it's amazing that the wizard of oz has remained in the pop culture discussion,0.057254426
so as a person who constantly talks about movies it's about time i talk about this 1939 victor fleming classic that everybody has already referenced at this point you've always had the power to go back to kansas excuse me why didn't you tell her before because she wouldn't have believed me are you out of your mind,0.3272329
and i think i'll miss you most of all scarecrow,0.34600544
oh okay,0.066223346
it's kind of an odd thing to say yeah sort of a weird comment right in front of all of us kind of thought,0.22806478
this was a team effort,0.053613316
yeah dorothy is accompanied only by a batch of what can ultimately be called fully emasculated male figures a fragile impotent lion an effeminate scarecrow a fae tin man a brain a heart my own apartment and what was her sister a princess the wizard of oz and like i said at the beginning everyone has already watched and talked about this movie before every person has seen,0.5154597
this important cinematic triumph right,0.07744516
i feel like this makes an appearance in everybody's childhood but there's not too many who return to it with a new perspective as an adult my journey to oz has changed over time obviously i loved it as a kid it had its creepy moments,0.10993171
the unforgettable songs the memorable makeup i lived near the judy garland museum in grand rapids minnesota and visited it more than once one time the living munchkin actors were signing autographs and meeting people the ruby slippers would be given to the museum,0.13313526
every summer until they were mysteriously stolen they've since been found,0.23268452
but the fbi still hasn't released the full details of that story i vividly remember when scooby-doo came out in 2002 we were at the theater in grand rapids and a terrible tornado-like storm was rolling through reminiscent of the movie and just across the street,0.11247805
there was the judy garland house i really felt like we were going to be taken away to oz like a lot of viewers,0.12535796
i held on to my early memories,0.08650737
but never gave it another watch until we did a section on populism for a civics class in high school because it's been argued that the whole film is a populist allegory watching it again,0.06680516
it feels like things dragged a lot more than i remembered some of the effects felt pretty cheap and some things felt plain stupid like at one point the lion gets a second solo song number but the scarecrow and tin man only got one but what's that all about was it part of bert lars contract was he that impressive of a singer,0.5308444
well 80 years later it just leaves people puzzled the monkeys were dumb,0.7945937
the run time felt long and the whole charade felt like a huge plot hole,0.31089434
why didn't glenda just tell dorothy to use the shoe's magic to wish herself home all along,0.094469056
this was a kids movie for sure,0.10014886
and it was only intended for kids,0.08868478
i wasn't as cynical as a lot of teenagers become but my reaction to the wizard of oz was a low point for me,0.17381184
i have revisited it multiple times since if not yearly in fact it happens to be on my fiance's list of favorite films and our first date was catching a re-release of it in theaters,0.0670229
so i know this one very well from knowing that the actor who was going to play the tin man was replaced because he was allergic to the makeup to the gun the scarecrow is holding in one shot now in crystal clear high definition,0.31089434
and before you ask no i don't think an actor playing,0.1534627
a munchkin hung themself that was caught on camera,0.5876557
it's a crane a living bird on set,0.09533929
you can easily see it on anything,0.15472105
that's not a vhs from a technical standpoint,0.07821252
the wizard of oz is a marvel to look at,0.03818855
so many interesting techniques were done to bring this world to life but to push themselves even further they expanded the use of the technicolor process while making it an integral part of the story,0.07255087
the opening scenes take place in kansas in sepia tone a stylized looking black and white but in oz everything becomes color and to achieve this shot,0.004254216
they actually had a stunt double in a sepia tone dress in the house painted in brown and white and when she opens the door to us judy garland walks into frame as a fully realized color dorothy,0.001036063
it's moments like this that make you appreciate the work that they went to for what amounts to about 10 seconds of screen time especially when they have this silly edited cut only a few minutes later,0.53490317
they're gone,0.088747226
the makeup is still out of this world,0.13398564
i can't believe this is only 1939 because i somehow perfected the look of these characters so much it makes me wonder why even modern cinema can't make the fantasy designs look as good as they do here,0.06418581
the scarecrow makeup in particular looks almost like a potato sack you'd see in a real life scarecrow,0.5301596
i still can't comprehend how it was done,0.095259614
the story is classic,0.08811625
the traditional journey where out of this world personalities are met along the way it takes a simple idea and invests all of its worth into telling it well everyone has distinct charisma,0.07475032
this was at a time when hollywood was really into the waltz and tap dancing popcorn flicks which oz takes a lot of inspiration from yet with the backgrounds,0.05915544
and this set design things never feel dated even some of the cheesier effects have a charm to them that fit the tone of everything else,0.08647629
and even if it's noticeable,0.07222854
there's at least 10 other great special effects to follow it up with that will blow your mind this utilizes pyrotechnics miniatures forced perspective animatronics wires and so much more it transports you in a way that very few movies have been able to replicate the songs are good but i have a few comments the opening number has become a staple of american culture,0.10882266
but i probably prefer nearly every other cover of this song rather than the original judy garland is good don't get me wrong,0.0826711
but this is the only performance that feels of the time the munchkinland melody is rapid and bouncy hopping between different styles and vocals as a huge portion of the backstory is explained through song,0.0817867
it's the moment where the munchkins really get to shine and for becoming such big icons in their own right,0.16946642
you kind of forget that this is the only scene where they appear,0.20748286
if i only had a brain works for the different characters who replaced brain with heart or nerve but i'm not really a fan of king of the forest like i said just feels a bit overblown for an actor in a movie that wasn't really about showcasing the famous actors and their talents at the time we're off to see the wizard is of course the most addictive piece ever created and must be saying anytime you're with a group of friends walking in a horizontal lineup,0.17055601
the witch still freaks me out to this day,0.76806235
there's something about that extremely green skin and the voice that terrifies me more than any horror villain would finding out that margaret hamilton was a schoolteacher doesn't really help to improve things,0.13476406
think about it would you want this,0.07320028
actress disciplining you in the 1930s the wizard was really disturbing as a kid too even with the reveal of the true man behind the curtain,0.18728927
i still couldn't forget that floating alien looking head where did they even come up with that design surprisingly a lot of the humor still works today,0.105893955
and there's even a few things that only an older audience would notice like the fortune teller in kansas who's obviously duping dorothy into running back home you also notice that the kansas farmers look an awful lot like the actors who played the main characters in oz,0.10196474
there's things that just make you laugh,0.08117428
that may not be intentional like how matter-of-fact glenda is after the wicked,0.25462487
witch of the east is killed,0.6740637
she has such a bubbly personality,0.63321257
even though a murder just occurred when they get out of the poppy field this old timey boppity music starts up and the characters stop and start dancing along as if they can also hear it is,0.1509699
it's not just for the audience or does the music play for anyone who's entering the city of oz,0.05227064
it's not as funny when you realize that that snow in the background is actually asbestos and of course by far,0.07666752
the best part is that epic window jump,0.10665742
the lion does he runs down the longest hallway in existence breaks through the glass of the window and it fades to black we don't even see what happens or if he gets injured they just cut to the next scene,0.2441345
i'm kind of surprised this turned out as perfect as it did it had quite a few interesting production tidbits like the tin man actor who got replaced dorothy starting out with a blonde wig and margaret hamilton sustaining third-degree burns from a failed pyrotechnic stunt the craziest part is the number of directors,0.40313736
they went through they started out with norman tarag who did some of the test footage he was replaced by richard thorpe who only shot for nine days and shot,0.34182236
the only footage of buddy epson as the tin man he was replaced by george cuccor after mervyn leroy was unhappy with the footage but kukor left after only making a few creative choices at this point most of the finished shots had to be redone and victor fleming came in so kukor could go back to working on gun with the wind fleming is the final credited director but to my surprise,0.118648864
as of this writing i discovered yet another director came on after fleming left to replace kukor again on of all things gone with the wind king vidor only directed some of the kansas scenes,0.10319678
but in total the wizard of oz had four directors,0.054110143
they should make a movie just about the making of this movie regardless,0.10515378
this is a 5 out of 5 star movie if you ask me and the themes are effective,0.07111078
even today,0.03043293
i guess you can call it simplistic with its morals,0.15741521
but i think that's why they remain timeless,0.051788874
the gifts received at the end are not what the characters were specifically seeking,0.07550527
but they represent everything gained from the journey including knowledge kindness and courage,0.050426275
the gifts are only tokens possessed by the types of people,0.26272127
they aspire to be,0.05069222
but along the way they already achieved them,0.10406118
the idea of there being no place like home has become a comforting sentiment,0.110941604
i don't think it really means that a person should never go beyond the world they've grown up in dorothy already went on the journey even if it's considered a dream but after all the excitement,0.06048678
it's good to relax in a setting you're familiar with how do i recommend something that everyone's already seen,0.10300303
well if it's been a few years i say go watch it again,0.08703083
you might be surprised by just how good it still is and there might be a few things that you catch that i haven't even caught yet some of those smaller details,0.18527411
if you're a fan of cinema that uses special effects to tell its story,0.09337455
this is a must watch just like mary poppins blade,0.16929269
runner willy wonka movies that utilize a wide range of different special effects wizardry they have a huge debt to pay to the wizard itself special,0.052300643
