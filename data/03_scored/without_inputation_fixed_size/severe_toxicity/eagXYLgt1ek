once again I find myself wrestling with how I felt about a comic book film,0.094447434
a popular comic book film and if there's one thing the internet supports its gracious,0.023391848
differences of opinion so before anybody else loses their damn mind on my channel just,0.44322848
purely based on the title of the video let me just preface that thor ragnarok,0.08072136
is an earn it that's right I'm giving you my verdict on this film in,0.041915882
the first twenty seconds of this video just to calm everyone down I like the,0.12326917
movie but really just barely now if you're the kind of person that loved this,0.05903904
film unabashedly and can't stand to hear any criticism about it you should probably just,0.15702125
move on but if you're genuinely interested in hearing my thoughts on the film phase,0.029335264
three and the future of the MCU then please by all means join the conversation,0.03261462
now for those of you clicking on this video who know nothing about my channel,0.13402186
you're probably thinking to yourself this guy barely liked Thor Ragnarok must be a DC,0.15547536
fanboy right no if I could talk about DC for a second and I will,0.0504442
let's face it Man of Steel was okay Wonder Woman was good but the rest,0.13165182
of it was pretty much a hot mess but it's not about DC the fact,0.05957185
is Marvel fans in the past myself included seem to think that Marvel is infallible,0.028513761
but the problem is that neither DC nor Marvel seemingly want to admit that they,0.02832485
may have problems which will ultimately just lead to more problems DC seemingly can admit,0.07835464
that other than Wonder Woman totally their films have been a mess Suicide Squad is,0.14760226
a perfect example of how they just can't seem to find a good balance between,0.045326944
humor and the dark of grittiness they really want to go for it but Marvel,0.046987243
on the flip side needs to admit that at times their films are too light,0.025656799
too jovial to joke written and as a result none of them really feel like,0.05717985
there are any real consequences within the story and if you're the kind of person,0.041370433
who's blindly devoted to only one side of this if you say to yourself screw,0.20690271
Marvel I don't need their baby rainbow-colored or screw DC I don't need their dark,0.4418734
ideological dumpster fire I wish I were you I wish I had the kind of,0.30757523
misguided self righteousness and confidence typically only reserved for Nazis and Harvey Weinstein unnecessarily harsh,0.20895614
perhaps but it needs to be said and here's what I'm really good something I've,0.020056617
said before when DC and marvel truly compete when they are in fact equals we,0.011218322
as the audience went because they have to produce the best films available if there's,0.014207657
no real competition then they can shell out whatever they want because they know we're,0.026654573
gonna pay for it but right now Marvel seems to be getting a little overconfident,0.07266267
and that's because so far while DC is competing financially they're not necessarily competing critically,0.028058112
and you know what Marvel is showing their overconfidence because right now in my opinion,0.050305843
phase 3 is their weakest phase because so far with ant-man Doctor Strange guardians of,0.06840948
the galaxy 2 and now clora Ragnarok it's been their most comedic phase comedy in,0.037018135
a Marvel movie is obviously one of their stables and made me fall in love,0.099124335
with the MCU but is this a little too much in small doses humor can,0.044272628
add layers it can add interest it can change up the tone appropriately from the,0.017780358
very dark tone that a lot of comic book films are now going for however,0.074118756
that's in small doses and with Marvel films their jokes seem to be very obvious,0.08079919
at times even juvenile and humor is now starting to define their films in Thor,0.03771857
Ragnarok the humor is constant it's an incessant stream of characters trying to one-up one,0.029190918
another when it comes to your and you know what it's really starting to change,0.03576227
of iconic characters into something they're not this may have to do with the report,0.021185433
that much of the film was actually improvised but that actually caused a lot of,0.028259663
issues number one everyone on the team because let's face it most comic book films,0.10945464
feature a lot of characters not just one solo character but everyone on the team,0.010996816
is suddenly the same character here's what I mean by that when the Avengers got,0.016205205
together in 2012 yeah everybody told a joke or two but really there is only,0.024562571
one of them who was considered the funny one that goes to Tony Stark in,0.044935815
Phase two Marvel really followed the formula that Whedon set out in the Avengers the,0.039978202
fact that within the team there always has to be one wisecracking superhero the most,0.0233087
obvious being star-lord in guardians of the galaxy but in Phase three they amped that,0.038088415
up even more suddenly within every superhero film in every group there are three or,0.040973984
four funny ones guardians of the galaxy two is a perfect example star-lord is still,0.038935196
wisecracking but Rocket Raccoon this game even Drax the one who is the straight man,0.13390213
in the first film with a few dry jokes he's cracking wise about his own,0.02785523
feces thor ragnarok had that problem but made it exponentially worse because every character for,0.24854924
most of the time they are on screen they are trying to be funny it,0.0217688
was a huge shift in tone and character from the first two Thor films and,0.016163297
you know what it changed the characters of both Ford and Hulk even new characters,0.013356223
who could have easily balanced all the humor coming from two iconic Avengers were humorous,0.034368042
characters scourge was very silly compared to the original source material in the comic books,0.12633367
cork who's extremely serious in the very serious Planet Hulk storyline does nothing but joke,0.02984413
even hella the goddess of death loves to throw in a few quips you do,0.33835185
have to admit though Jeff Goldblum stole the show in previous Marvel films especially in,0.07771075
phase 1 & 2 there was a much better balance of humor drama and action,0.029332602
sure there were jokes in the previous films but they had other things to it,0.01745442
and with these characters constantly trying to be funny it makes me not take any,0.05850357
of them seriously you see you can have the characters tell jokes without dumb themselves,0.31923765
becoming jokes this film also did the same thing with epic Marvel storylines they wasted,0.07253761
them because they didn't take them seriously Planet Hulk was one of the best laid,0.059450787
out storylines in the Marvel comics it was one of the best stories for Hulk,0.026377857
period and you know what it was relegated it was nothing better than a side,0.047022495
story much like my favorite superhero Hulk who was nothing more than a sidekick all,0.10541232
I'm saying is Marvel just don't waste greatness and if I'm to be impartial which,0.054729316
a good critic should be I have to use part of the same criticism I,0.03670816
had for Batman V Superman the Planet Hulk story got pushed aside for one very,0.022753272
obvious reason because much like Batman V Superman marvel this time tried to do too,0.03522347
much the death of Odin the introduction of three new major characters a little of,0.07743536
the Ragnarok story a little Planet Hulk and even a Doctor Strange cameo the last,0.025719991
major that I had an issue with this film is the reason that I've already,0.03936091
mentioned and you know what it's one that has given the MCU a lot of,0.02677963
criticism and that is the fact that there just doesn't seem like there are any,0.01659367
consequences within this universe DC fans have really taken notice and once again I think,0.034224365
the thor ragnarok just made it worse a lot of people not just DC fans,0.07460633
have noticed that death in the MCU for the most part means next to nothing,0.30793545
Coulson Bucky Nick Fury all died to mean something to push our characters in a,0.32601237
much more important direction and they did only for those dead people to come back,0.22908077
almost immediately if you think about some of the deaths in thor ragnarok most notably,0.053134203
the Warriors 3 what did their deaths do they didn't inspire Thor it was almost,0.07148329
as if you didn't know that they died it was a terrible tribute to three,0.051157944
characters and in two previous Thor films were like his brothers in my opinion even,0.017717166
Owens death was kind of brushed aside which was too bad because that scene in,0.14357789
particular was some of the best writing in the film probably because it wasn't comedic,0.03008293
it was a character building moment but if you think about it once again any,0.02080362
time there could have been a great character building moment the breakup with Jane Thor's,0.015516739
relationship with hella his father's death nothing happened it didn't go anywhere and what's with,0.23147133
Loki standing in the middle of New York like he didn't try to destroy the,0.06545873
city five years ago and that really sums it up for me but you know,0.039705478
what the funniest part is within thor ragnarok there's actually a scene that personifies this,0.041270655
problem Thor says to Loki in the elevator at the end of the day brother,0.047017843
you will always be you and I will always be me you see Marvel is,0.054407366
interested in these characters changing slightly you can make Thor funnier you can make the,0.02423663
whole top but without real consequences without a proper balance in tone Marvel is showing,0.025630191
us that they're not really interested in these characters growing yes this film is entertaining,0.0447642
I hear it all the time about Marvel films but you know what at this,0.04942381
point that's not enough I was a little indifferent about Doctor Strange I was a,0.014938029
little indifferent about ant-man and you know what after Thor Ragnarok I think I'm out,0.065412164
of free passes basically what I'm saying Marvel is enough joking around as always let,0.049880125
