hello,0.05446308
everyone today i will be reviewing a night at the opera,0.1505139
so a night at the opera came out in 1935,0.09822007
and was directed by sam wood and this film is a comedy and stars the marx brothers this was actually the first marx brothers film to not star zeppo,0.06873423
so this film has the three main marx brothers in it who are groucho chico and harpo and this film is actually about these two opera stars rosa and rodolfo and they go aboard this ocean liner on the way to the united states of america,0.12190067
and in fact most this film is actually set on board this ocean liner,0.09491911
we also have this other opera star who's known as ricardo and he is in love with rosa,0.11291171
but obviously when all this is happening,0.07611286
we also have the marx brothers in the situation as well so groucho marx he plays this rich man who is um in love with this lady who's played by margaret dumont and margo dumont actually appears in quite a lot of the marx brothers films we also get chico marx who plays ricardo's manager and then we get harpo marks he plays rodolfo's dresser and since rodolfo is not a very nice guy poor harpo gets treated quite badly in this film so this was the first time i'd ever seen this film and it's actually only the second marx brothers film i've seen the other marx brothers film i've seen is duck soup,0.24218985
and when i'm comparing this to duck soup in all honesty this isn't quite as good as duck soup though it is a very funny film duck suit is very wacky and crazy,0.52632993
and the plot in that film is a bit ridiculous to be honest whereas the plot in this film is actually fairly realistic,0.53490317
and you can really see this happening as a proper story,0.060617406
even if the markzwares weren't in it but nevertheless the marx brothers do bring a lot of humor to this film and it's a very enjoyable watch,0.12809272
and there are loads of brilliant jokes scattered throughout this film particularly with groucho marx he has lots of witty one-liners as he does in all his films,0.19519962
he really is the vocal comedy aspect of the film in terms of actually tenon jokes obviously harpo marx is a mute,0.3577304
so a lot of his comedy is very physical with the way he is acting,0.24011727
and chico,0.058899015
marx is always there in the background or at the front um having a laugh and making a few jokes and being an excellent presence on screen,0.16335732
so all together,0.046744138
there are actually lots of funny bits throughout this film i think possibly my favorite scene in the film is when they're aboard the ocean liner and poor old groucho marx he is stuck in this tiny room and the room just has a bed and and a giant suitcase and that's about it and a tiny sink in the corner and all of a sudden it turns out that chico and harpo and also um,0.24203797
ricardo they have smuggled into a suitcase and then they all appear in the room so there's these four guys in this tiny little room all of a sudden someone knocks the door an engineer comes in then and then afterwards a manicure comes in and then some waiters come in to deliver the food and all of a sudden this room is really crowded,0.15174997
everyone is jumping on top of each other climbing everywhere,0.15164301
it's a really funny scene,0.104818955
and then margaret dumont's character knocks on the door,0.15294617
i open it,0.066096164
and everybody spills out onto the floor,0.14350076
and obviously it's it's a very physical joke so it's very funny as you watch it on screen and it's certainly one of the highlights of the film another brilliant scene is when this man is searching for chico and harpo because they're basically stowed away illegally and they're hiding,0.17568694
and he's looking around these rooms everywhere trying to find him and all of a sudden these characters they are having to move the beds out of the way and go outside on the balcony and come back in again,0.10681294
and just the way this whole sequence is arranged is really clever and it must have been really,0.078448325
well thought out you can certainly tell when you're watching a marx brothers films that a lot of the jokes are actually very intelligent,0.19167374
and are all just put in the exact right place,0.06188797
and they'll end up working together so well in in the context of the story,0.045584053
so like i said earlier the the story in this is actually fairly realistic and it's quite clever the way they manage to work,0.062235095
these jokes in and also create a very believable story with some excellent humor in it now as i did say i do prefer duck soup,0.09810887
and i think the jokes in duck soup tend to just stand out a bit more in my mind there are,0.20949276
so many funny jokes in duck soup in this film there are lots of funny jokes,0.1519096
there's just not quite as many big jokes or not um not quite as many memorable sequences as there are in duck suit from what i can remember watched it last night i enjoyed it quite a bit however it just didn't have that extra push that duck soup has,0.18160084
and although if i'm being honest although zeppo was in duck soup he didn't have a massive part in that film anyway,0.19132556
so perhaps this film wasn't necessarily missing zeppo and it certainly had lots of jokes in it,0.084444016
and this film also tries to do the um romantic subplot as well like a lot of the marx brothers films do but this film actually manages to work their romantic subplot um into the story very well and in fact there are actually quite a few scenes in this film that don't have the marx brothers in at all they just have rosa and ricardo and they're actually singing to each other,0.106907524
while one is on the boat and one is down below and these scenes are obviously opera which obviously comes from the title night at the opera in general,0.083178274
the marx brothers films do have musical elements to them,0.094918884
there's this excellent sequence on the ship when ricardo is singing,0.09802739
this song um kosikosa,0.1539316
and it's a very catchy song when everybody is singing along to it,0.09235736
so overall,0.06683016
i have to say a night of the opera a really good comedy um,0.1265082
one of the best classic comedies of all time really not as good as duck soup in my opinion however still very amusing and still a very good comedy,0.15503515
i always am surprised by how well the jokes and marx brothers film hold up nowadays bear in mind this film is 85 years old,0.0631881
so obviously some of it will seem dated obviously but actually a lot of the jokes they still made me laugh,0.102041125
and i had a very good time having said that it's probably not necessarily one of the films i would come back to straight away as a classic comedy for some reason doesn't quite stand out in my mind as much as ones like duck soup,0.20377165
nevertheless i do recommend it,0.06266911
and it's an excellent comedy,0.15756834
so i'm going to give a night of the opera a rating of 8 out of 10.,0.099078715
it's a fantastic comedy and well worth seeing so if you enjoy these old classic comedies this is definitely one that has to be watched,0.15886831
