he goes to see lots of different people who are either at the scene of,0.08765642
the crime or heard what happened and he finds out that different people seem to,0.10082863
have different accounts of what happened some people say a certain thing happens some people,0.08004554
say something else happens and it turns out that there might be a mysterious third,0.081695884
man who was involved in this crime and in fact we don't actually know whether,0.18405458
it was a murder or whether it was an accident or how many people were,0.29164988
involved or the circumstances and throughout this film we are following holly martin's as he,0.055044904
tries to discover the truth about what happens to harry lyme and how in fact,0.0744619
he died now we also get a supporting cast in this film um we get,0.17282392
trevor howard he plays a character called major callaway who is essentially trying to also,0.17027427
figure out what has happened to harry lyme and he believes that harry ryan was,0.08562651
involved in some suspicious activity himself which could have possibly led to his death and,0.3505818
we also get um alida valley who plays a character called anna schmidt who was,0.06994294
a woman who was at harry lam's funeral and he was very much in love,0.3373059
with harry line and then we also get this story developed this romance angle between,0.036928948
holly martens and anna schmidt as well although holly martens obviously really likes anna anna,0.1845393
still cannot stop thinking about harry and how much she misses him so this was,0.14280961
the first time i'd ever seen this film so going into it i didn't know,0.10210274
exactly what to expect i knew this film was very well regarded it's actually number,0.08356374
one on the british film institute's greatest british films of all time and it does,0.086317934
have a very british film to it although interestingly enough it's also listed on the,0.056481663
american foot um on the american film institute's list of 100 greatest american movies in,0.10428672
1998. really the only american links to it are that awesome wales is in it,0.055111766
and joseph cotton they're both american and also the producer was david o'sellsnick who was,0.10938617
american who produce many big hollywood films such as gone with the winds but really,0.08306244
the director carol reed is british and it does have a very british feel to,0.054466896
it so i quite like that and what i really like about this film is,0.0648009
the cinematography and in fact this film actually only won one oscar which was for,0.07906574
the cinematography because it's shot in gorgeous black and white and this this film is,0.08428029
filled with loads of fantastic lighting effects really dark shadows and some tilted camera angles,0.14592314
to give it a certain effect and it really is such a beautiful film to,0.06183054
look at this is one of the best looking black and white films i've ever,0.08369033
seen it's one of those films that i cannot picture it being in color because,0.14948161
if it was in color i really don't think it would work the right way,0.1424451
what is also great about this film is the setting so it was shot entirely,0.11047334
on location in vienna and remember this was 1949 so it was only a few,0.06879581
years after the end of world war ii and as such vienna looks a very,0.1702541
desolate place there's lots of places which have been bombed lots of buildings which look,0.31089434
very dilapidated and looks quite run down but when it's shot in this spectacular black,0.43865967
and white with all these lighting and dark shadows really gives it a mysterious effect,0.1868264
to it really adds to the tone of the film gives us a sense of,0.02658908
intrigue and mystery which i really appreciated another thing that i have to mention in,0.080562726
this film is the musical score so the score for this film was done by,0.06180225
anton carrass and he was completely new to the film going in this was a,0.29265457
completely original score so people didn't really know what to expect and the musical score,0.054472074
to this it's so memorable we always get this music playing throughout the film in,0.05006109
certain situations and after watching the film i had it stuck in my head for,0.13110876
quite a while because it's such so such a memorable piece of music and it's,0.07214685
very quirky and it's very unusual and it almost doesn't really go with the tone,0.059214264
of the film because the music in this film it's very sort of light-hearted almost,0.05378616
a bit silly and slapstick like sounding it's a real contrast to what is happening,0.60455513
in the film with obviously this murder and mystery angle that's going on for some,0.1874898
reason it just works perfectly when it almost shouldn't really and it's this music really,0.06075869
that gives the film a real modern feel to it it's the sort of thing,0.08280392
that they would do in lots of modern films now to just make it more,0.05897349
appealing make it more interesting and going back to watch a film like this in,0.10287393
1949 that was doing this is really fantastic to see and it really makes the,0.041456893
film seem very ahead of its time now in terms of the story which is,0.028316569
really i suppose the main element of the film this is what really gripped me,0.07347021
i really loved the characters and the film i loved the performances and just the,0.023076126
story itself the constant interaction between these characters the conversations that they're having is really,0.050456222
what makes the film so interesting i was so interested in the plot in this,0.06231046
film i really like the plot we're constantly following holly martin's throughout this film and,0.07974731
i really wanted to know what was happening as we unlock more and we understand,0.06907399
and we use the audience understand more about what is going on what has happened,0.0560526
to harry lime we really want to get a sense of understanding and this film,0.10538365
does a really good job of holding my attention really wanting me to keep watching,0.113704614
and make sure that i stay until the very end of the film so overall,0.08589811
i have to say the third man it's a brilliant fill noir and it's one,0.2044423
of the best british films of all time as i said british film institute called,0.08635402
it number one above films like the 39 steps and launch of arabia and i,0.14990874
