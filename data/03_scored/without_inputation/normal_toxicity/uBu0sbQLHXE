hey there's hope hi everyone my name is Chris and welcome to tread talks where,0.03894855
I walk on this treadmill to stay in shape while making videos for you fine,0.2999005
people I stepped into Wonder Woman the same way that many of you will hoping,0.15296784
that the character that we get a glimpse of in Batman V Superman could be,0.060579136
fleshed out into someone whose journey we want to follow and what they've done with,0.105238385
this film is more than meet that expectation the core premise of the movie is,0.08102808
thankfully focused and simple we follow a sheltered Princess Diana as she's drawn into the,0.18282458
conflict of the First World War and through that premise we see her journey and,0.16848956
discovering who she is what she's capable of and ultimately what role she'll choose to,0.17989697
play in the world and right up front I'll say that gal gadot is spot,0.0949881
on as Wonder Woman whatever concerns we may have had from the limited performance we,0.07602098
saw in Batman V Superman is quickly replaced by what we see here there's emotional,0.079649955
weight and range there's believable conviction and a general optimistic sincerity that's difficult to pull,0.037848298
off and yet she does so easily and that's on top of doing an admirable,0.08042675
job of selling the physicality of the character she takes things that could come off,0.14892903
as cheesy or silly and for the most part makes it convincing and beyond that,0.47169074
I think I'll nominate Chris Pine as one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood,0.03873473
today his relationship with Diana is one of the main reasons the movie works so,0.09003229
well their chemistry with each other quickly wins us over and as the movie progresses,0.06652898
we see him slip easily between humor and drama and he ends up serving as,0.15422955
the perfect counterpoint to her focused idealism and there's a moment in the movie where,0.055810202
the camera lingers on his face and you see the multitude of emotions that he's,0.4033778
experiencing all in a short span of time it's a wonderful moment amidst a great,0.07202479
supporting performance now as far as the story is concerned I really appreciated the level,0.05484649
of focus they kept throughout the film almost every character whether it's Diana's mother her,0.04198107
trainer Steve Trevor or Diana herself all their motivations are made clear without hitting us,0.15000625
over the head with it and I also thought it was great how the fish-out-of-water,0.1779071
elements were just played up for Laughs and humor instead we have a story where,0.07537622
Diana's understanding of humanity is intertwined with her discovery of who she is and the,0.15125678
decision about the role she'll play in the world and so by the end you,0.09939506
have some themes that come to a satisfying conclusion because we've been able to track,0.053433076
with it throughout the entire story to go along with that I also found the,0.02037294
tone and the mindset of the characters to be a refreshing departure from what seems,0.05903324
to have been established in the DC extended universe so far Diana herself has cast,0.12603396
as a determined and optimistic warrior someone that we want to root for and follow,0.08050809
because she fights for something that is nobler than vengeance or bitterness and the movie,0.1287786
also allows for moments of celebration and levity that are appropriate to the overall tone,0.08517848
of the film and thankfully the climax of the movie succeeds not so much on,0.06101647
the shoulders of computer-generated imagery but because of the relationships and the drama that we've,0.06808168
been following throughout it was believable and it manages to save the movie from what,0.051320687
would have otherwise been an average superhero movie climax of course there are a few,0.10881208
missteps but nothing that Sully's the overall experience of the movie the villains that you,0.31089434
see throughout the film for example they're pretty one-dimensional and shallow in fact there's a,0.06669648
scene where they're practically cackling to one another over the fiendishness of what they've just,0.17156813
done it's pretty difficult to take them seriously you'll also see some moments that go,0.10390304
a little bit too far into cheesiness territory but the performances are sincere enough that,0.087049276
I didn't mind and there are a couple of moments in the action where slow,0.06056978
motion was used a little bit too liberally for my taste but I did appreciate,0.19047862
the clarity and the impact that it added to most of those scenes and finally,0.030792585
although the movie flows very well the final act of the film is set into,0.050144494
motion by a character making an unnecessary revelation it's the kind of thing that I,0.0867646
faulted guardians of the galaxy 2 for and it's almost as if they couldn't find,0.061185822
a natural way to bring that about but in the end all of this pales,0.095314406
in comparison to how much the movie does right this is a movie that should,0.05623076
give some hope to the overall success of the DC extended universe it's a strong,0.052568845
and touching origin story that leaves you with a big old smile on your face,0.3559257
and that's why I give Wonder Woman three and a half out of 5 stars,0.1095656
okay so that was Wonder Woman now this was one of those rare instances where,0.1395998
I was able to see a film before its release so it's great to be,0.06993845
able to share my opinion while it still may have some impact so if you,0.07664949
go see this movie let me know if you liked it as much as I,0.15084581
did beyond that over the course of the next week or so I'll be travelling,0.05317151
so the next videos will come a couple of weeks from now one is going,0.09195881
to be on the fitness side where I did a ninja warrior type challenge so,0.059706863
you'll see how I stack up in my current shape and fitness and on the,0.22872381
other hand I'll be reviewing cars 3 when it comes out in the middle of,0.06621138
