[Music] hello and welcome to the five-minute film club singing in the rain is a 1952 musical comedy starring debbie reynolds donald o'connor and gene kelly who also choreographed and co-directed the film with stanley doanen set in a late 1920s hollywood it shows a time in motion picture history when silent films made the transition to the talkies kelly's don lockwood is the top silent star of his day accompanied by his starlet lena lamont played by gene hagen who i last reviewed in the asphalt jungle they attract a huge crowd to their latest romantic drama the royal rascal and at the premiere he tells a rather untruthful version of how he got to where he is now i also really like the flashback scenes over the top of don lockwood's less than genuine retelling of his early days and you know sets up his character nicely um he's a bit of a jerk at the film's after show party the head of the studio shows a test for talking pitcher and it is immediately pooh-poohed by his guests and they all laugh about the upcoming jazz singer truly warner brothers first talking pitcher because they predict it will bomb however it doesn't an rf rushes to change the next lamont lockwood film into a talkie however lamont is less than suitable for numerous reasons the first being that she can't seem to talk and act at the same time and number two well she sounds like this i'm so down-hearted theresa my father has me betrothed to the burundi landscape and i can't stand them lockwood and his best friend cosmo brown played by donald o'connor devise a plan to use background dancer singer kathy selden played by the wonderful debbie reynolds as a voice actor to dub over all of lena's lines and actually turn the film into a musical rf is won over with the idea and don and kathy also start a relationship much to lena's annoyance lena is also less than hot on the idea of being dubbed and feeling threatened by kathy battles with rf to make sure kathy always remains in the background which in turn put strain on don and kathy's burgeoning partnership singing in the rain was designed to be a jukebox musical of sorts featuring the back catalogue of songwriter arthur freed who was responsible for all of the big mgm musicals of the day as most of the songs he was famous for including singing in the rain were released in the early days of talking pictures screenwriter betty condon and partner adolf greene decided to pay homage to that with a story set within that time films about hollywood particularly the golden age of cinema can spawn some really great films and hollywood always loves a story involving themselves and audiences like the nostalgia it brings so singing in the rain is a perfect example of that there are many reasons to watch this film but primarily you're here for the musical numbers and they are fantastic what i really loved about sitting watching the film is the fact that they sneak up on you this doesn't start off as a big all-out musical film it starts off more as a comedy and then slowly as the film within the film that we're watching the dueling cavalier becomes the dancing cavalier so does singing in the rain become a musical with each musical number they get bigger in scale and scope until the broadway melody number towards the end which shows off gene kelly as the genius choreographer and performer he was gene kelly was a hard taskmaster in getting the film exactly right and debbie reynolds described him as tricky she wasn't a dancer and they clashed quite a bit during the filming until fred astaire found her crying reynolds under a piano and gave her some extra lessons and probably more importantly some support the good morning dance routine was filmed for 15 hours straight and reynolds left with bleeding feet kelly didn't take it easy on himself either he had a fever for three days after filming the main singing in the rain number that number is of course amazing and i found it really powerful like all of the song and dance numbers in the film they have such a great organic feel about them and kelly's voice in singing in the rain is so soft and gentle i think what makes it so emotional is that it shows don lockwood being vulnerable for the first time in the film and not hiding behind his star status he has fallen madly in love with kathy and so what better expression than to dance and sing in the rain singing in the rain is a must-watch for anyone that loves movies it is so full of fun and joy and i can't think of a better time to finally tick this film off of my list
