Not gonna lie to you guys
I knew nothing about this movie till a couple days ago
No Salamis movie coming out this weekend
"Alright, what's it about? It's totally"
It's about Dr
"Martin Luther King, Jr"
- pretty important biographical picture that I didn't know about 48 hours
Pryor's
"let's do this, Selma"
So Selma is a movie about Dr
Martin Luther King Jr
It's not about his entire life
I love how biographical pictures are kind of doing this
Now they know that people don't necessarily want to see from birth to death
That just gets kind of long-winded at times
"This is about a specific point in his life in his civil rights movement that was happening, Calling it his civil rights movements, kind of downplaying"
It's the civil rights movement and in that the town they're in it's crooked as tensions are high
"and here we are, the dude who plays Dr"
Martin Luther King Jr
"in this movie, This David, Oh yellow, I was like"
I don't know anything about this guy
"Well, I don't I know anything about this guy"
Where did he come from? This? A good thing about these gems
That kind of fly under the radar
Stay might just showcase someone who
That's absurdly great acting talent
"Oh my God, this was like watching Dr"
Martin Luther King Jr
"Like, right in front of you, He's actually the Doctor and Rise to the Planet of the Apes"
I didn't know that I am Db
Did enough
The movie was over
I was like I don't know what you're in
You
tell me what your red got
It was really cool
He's British
"Oh my God, he hid that accent well and gained an entirely new one"
But I love how this movie peels away the legend because at this point Dr
"Martin Luther King, Jr"
", hear about it"
He's Dr
"Martin Luther King, Jr"
He had all the answers
He had the movement
He never strayed from the course
He was like
"I know we're going to succeed March March, March, This is kind of how he's taught to everybody"
but it's not like that
"Behind that there's a guy who at a point and this whole thing was like, I don't know if we're gonna win"
I love seeing mamas like that
It's like Saving Private Ryan when Tom Hanks gets behind the rock where no one can see him and he breaks down
"You're like, Oh yeah, you gotta like, Stay the course as the leader but in the end you're a guy"
you're a human
You're a mortal man
"It's important for movies to show that when the legends are too big, normal people are like"
"Oh, I can't do something like that because he's him and I'm just me, but in the end Ii, he's just him"
He's just like you
It's important for movies to show that to us
A good job on this movie
Some of the in this movie is just hard to watch
You watch
You're like that happened
It's just a really dark time
It's one of those things
"Well, Yeah, there's laws and stuff in place"
but when you're in a town where the cards are just completely stacked against you and anyone who has your skin color
"Yeah, it gets really bad and I love the fight"
you know me
I love me my politics
"In my movies, I love the fact that it showed a political chess game happening in the movie Among movement"
Lbj was president at the time and his show that he had his reason for being like
"Yeah, Dr"
Martin Luther King Jr
Why don't you go ahead and lead the movement And Martin Luther King Jr
had his things that he had to do
"You know, there were politics involved"
"Knows like that's It's not just kind of like Alright, Everyone, let's March and it'll get it done"
"There were a lot of cogs in play and it just kind of gets lost through translation among the decades, so we're a couple of moments to say something tragic happens and it goes to this slow-mo shot"
"It's a really long slow-mo shot really long, and a long shot can be effective"
"But it when it's too long, you're like Alright, Still a slow-mo shot"
Then we're still here
We're still here
It gives you time during the slow-mo shot to think about the effect of what the shot would have been
if it wasn't a slo-mo shot
It actually would have been a little more real and possibly a little more effective if it felt a little more real
Thus it shouldn't have been a slo-mo shot
at least not that long
"In the end, Selma surprised me because like I said last week, I didn't know about this movie"
The acting was great
The one who plays Dr
Martin Luther King Jr
"in this movie, David, Oh yellow, keep your eye out for that guy"
"Oh my God, he's He's gonna get more work"
I just don't call on it now because I like calling the obvious
It's kind of like when that light turns green cars are gonna go
"It's that obvious to me to say, this dudes gonna get a lot more working"
You're gonna see him a lot more
"the well-acted movie, a well-directed movie, An effective movie"
Selma is definitely worth buying on Blu-ray Great movie
"Go say, If you see taking three over this, you get slapped by life"
So what happens? Don't give takin your money
"Don't let take and take you All right, So Selma, have you seen it? What did you think about it? Whatever you thought, Comment below, let me know"
"and as always, if you like what you've seen here and you wanna see more, click right here to see more"
