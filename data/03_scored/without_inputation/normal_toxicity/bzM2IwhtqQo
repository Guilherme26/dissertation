hila won't turn over my classic reviews,0.09859734
well fickle my auto favorite movies even we watch Bennett can review it and in this video I'm talking about the third man so the third man is a classic British film which often said to be one of the best British films some respectable sources even called it the very best footage film all I won't call it,0.13991086
my favourite British film,0.0399005
I'm not unhappy to see you cited as a and I think it's a pretty fair choice to be honest,0.23871356
the third man is definitely a masterpiece in a very iconic and classic film there's many things about it a memorable performances are amenable story,0.08523397
it has an iconic theme is it fun which is really important and very significant and I think it's a phone which just holds up I think to this day sinks a link with new film the third,0.08125715
one is a big coat too focused work,0.09169413
but it also has these fantastic sale is set in Vienna in the late 1940s would you own Vienna in Austria stood by the Allied powers and so this is a city which is clearly ruined by war or to fact we're in the film we see visuals of water on building,0.100509845
it's quite clear that they film the cars of Vienna that were still destroyed from World War two and I think that gives it a very unique atmosphere and mood that you don't get many per day,0.10511962
if you filmed their filmed in the aftermath of a war,0.2407379
well the apps why I stopped quite clearly present,0.098681785
because of this be enemies very much too dark and seedy city in this film it's a place of high cultures being reduced to this black market Haven,0.17601417
it's been reduced to a place of crime,0.21886408
in fact the whole mystery in the third money's assassinated by the fact that both the authorities and the criminals are secretive about hiding things,0.12753956
and the fact that no one's really open because everyone feels like they can't be because there's constant crossing over those boundaries its borders of limitations,0.10036422
people are constantly being taught in different directions between sides of the law who really runs Vienna is it the criminals is it,0.18768118
the authorities,0.06574541
in fact the authorities are quite ineffective in a lot of ways,0.3470579
five hundred years of peace just abuse a cuckoo clock is an interesting self idea the filth rose up and that's an interesting sort of metaphor for this,0.24062228
you kind of point out how ineffectual to flips a lot of this is becoming about how per guest comes to brutality in a way,0.38333857
so the certainly these whole see the aspect the obsolete characters the ones who seem most out of place in this city because they've lost their City to the forces outside their control of would-be crime I would be so from here but it just didn't be a little bit spoiler heavy cuz,0.1514775
it's difficult to talk about the third man without talking about the fact that has a fantastic twist midway through and that fantastic twist is revelation of the culture of it also wells how he liked being alive all the time and that twist is talk at a city where the light is suddenly shone on to have a lime producing him from the darkness,0.07268628
and we have this wonderful zoomin shot into Olson was this smiley face from that point on the film,0.17603944
but if he just cuts loose all a super first characters and plot FETs and the phone just becomes a story of how he and his friend Holly and his lover,0.11463247
and I think it's a very interesting and intricate the picture of how do you reconcile,0.10393371
if you learn your friend is a terrible person,0.7975896
in fact how do you comprehend your friendship or your love as another part of that is it's a very difficult scenario ahead around,0.0870565
and I think Harry Lime is an interesting enigma he's ruthless he cares only about number one,0.2570602
he's to touch her people miss interesting plot good would be detachment people,0.44281673
and so he quoted wise an individual why he can't be detached,0.16894022
but detachment in this case least to him being small before death and leads to him being also for people dying,0.24941516
and so that was perhaps the difference between him and Holly the main character,0.11276469
in fact Holly is a similar to having in fact in a way of Holy's a whole purpose in some ways to be a man a storyteller,0.10410987
so he writes cheap novels who's gone to this city of High Court I've found a stuff in a story,0.12656449
he's in the mystery,0.08348813
he's the hero to find the murderer and get the girl but how he has got the money,0.54314905
how he's got the girl but he's a mogul and Holly has some of that chomping morality of being a hero of his own story and the factory size of mobility is the key defining line between them when we get to that fantastic final sewer chase we see Holly finally realized who he is,0.23643862
and it ends,0.075472794
ambiguous normal,0.13592194
you don't really not quite how that friendship ends,0.19843097
we don't really know what happens in those final miles between them,0.10843733
and I think that's kinda significant because holding him,0.06667001
how are your great friends but to learn you're finished sir in model but also able to get what he wants he's such a turning point,0.09554208
it's such a fantastic moral conundrum for these characters who have got these broken histories and he's broken paths,0.14878641
and you've talked to the kind of clapping themselves the whole film would melancholic stove to its final shop,0.08999367
really where Holly is waiting for the girl and she abandons him,0.1552783
she snubbed him,0.12244672
she walked away their love,0.15366194
he's going to different directions it,0.09417709
ain't gonna happen to him,0.14934541
and I find that's kind of the purpose of this,0.06017491
he's done the right thing but he doesn't get what he wants and that's kind of mixed,0.11723407
it's a little bit more depressing in a way and a bit more interesting,0.35564432
it's not a film that has the normal happy,0.10798127
ending,0.17269279
even if the good guys win it's a fair one with a bit more edge to it,0.07812352
it doesn't just cop out with cheesiness the film that sticks to its guns you have to just say is help fantastically execute,0.19789554
the third one is so first of all the theme and the music is very iconic and memorable and it's used quite often in the film it's a little defensive,0.053797707
but I think it adds a real dramatic element to,0.084687434
so many Mormons,0.24173276
there's also the fantastic cinematography see this stark black or white which just creates this fantastic look and really build a living breathing city something Kabul Reid is known for he did it in his PV term Ottoman out and he almost did it later on in the musical Oliver,0.11286319
so Carol Reed is a master at producing create cities in his work and produce in a city with an underbelly,0.07853244
and the third man uses a lot of chango's doctor also interesting because they use so frequently in the film there often isn't people are talking to achieve reduce to emphasize just how shaky the world is just how seedy and full of lies it is,0.24041086
but also the feeling that it's just kind of that to be different the channels are that's not a lot,0.068172306
but what they really out of them is a sense of realism,0.2241822
you get the feeling that the world isn't constructed the world is real that the cameras has been thrown in amongst the action the cameras just a bit clumsily placed and it's just kind of something and I've been I produced a very interesting thing,0.10277642
I think this interesting looks because you have this very asymmetrical architecture created by the want Cameron,0.19720593
so I think it's fascinating,0.07508602
I think he's doing what donhad used to Django's,0.16748805
it feels like the film is a bit amateur,0.31153452
but at Leeds although delivered and I think that really comes across I think it's just a very well executed film in a very unique fashion,0.15163459
so the third one is they were executed,0.46771777
it's got great characters great fury ideas,0.12656164
that's a great saying it really is interesting in different,0.043442134
it holds up that's fantastic,0.07458574
actors fantastic story queer hold up to this day it's an exciting classic and very well deserve in the green as it came as it is,0.16783346
in fact the third man he's doing those films that is just a masterpiece,0.19583723
so the third man is fantastic,0.11095416
