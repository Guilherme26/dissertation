I'm kind of dressed up right not really nice no stuff as I would like,0.14647277
to be you because I was really trying to get specific items I kind of,0.017817609
find anywhere but I really need to do this movie review before is I completely,0.040646713
escape to my head this is just going to have to do it's not really,0.04084893
an outfit at all but the color kind of fits it I guess I don't,0.07874045
know maybe it doesn't but to me it does so that's what's important is that,0.016285691
in my heart I meant for it to match this movie the movie I am,0.056184735
discussing and reviewing today is Logan the new x-men movie that came out a little,0.06768244
while ago I didn't see it where he was actually in theaters which is really,0.01168129
sad because I work at the movie theatres and it was in theaters while I've,0.025330858
been working there but did I go see it no I didn't good job' but,0.02452266
I saw it on on-demand and decided to watch it with me Familia and you,0.09899729
have a really fun time I was super excited I love superhero movies I'm not,0.053261254
like super up-to-date on comics or anything like that so I don't pretend to be,0.043671302
like the super duper fans who like read the comics along with it and they,0.039571773
know exactly what comic is face office I'm not that but I do enjoy superhero,0.05710136
movies and I have people who have read the comics and they kind of catch,0.028570969
me up on the backstory of stuff that they don't live in the movies so,0.045692794
in the excellent franchise this was a very special movie because I believe in a,0.026110454
huge Ackman last movie is Wolverine it kind of makes sense that it would be,0.022389416
if you've seen it you know what I mean and then will be lived up,0.06337404
to the epicness like it should because Hugh Jackman is awesome and is there's an,0.045108765
awesome final last movie of Wolverine because he's done an excellent job with that role,0.046063304
so Hugh Jackman fabulous job if you couldn't tell by that I loved this movie,0.059321076
it was so good very intense it is definitely a darker take on the comics,0.05225217
marvel is usually very light and fun and has a little bit of humor in,0.017065287
it has dramatic moments but is known more for their lighter side and the more,0.013810542
action side and does have plenty of action trust me it has a lot of,0.024319114
action sequences in there but it also has a more soul and darker tone there,0.020638652
aren't a lot of funny moments really very very few there's very few in this,0.018313836
it's kind of like dark night a little bit you're not going in there to,0.28372335
have a happy-go-lucky time it was definitely a very intense movie it's at I can,0.01802049
definitely see people crying in this so bring tissues just in case and all the,0.07900187
characters are just so awesome you have a couple returning you have new ones a,0.016398108
lot of new ones for those of you who won sophistic it has an eight,0.23524158
point three out of ten on IMDB do you know how insane that is it,0.15333746
is on IMDB top 250 movies now you know how hard that is to do,0.07038441
oh my gosh that means that there is another movie out there that was on,0.05457965
that list that was 250 and it's up folks I'm sorry I'm so sorry to,0.023975214
that movie I'm pretty sure you are fantastic I have a lot of superhero movies,0.07825952
on that list a whole lot there's a couple there's blogan now big Avengers Dark,0.021521352
Knight I just know those three for sure that are on that list for those,0.014572178
of you who want to know the actors it starts of course Hugh Jackman as,0.028189152
Wolverine who else DA has Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier as you always is and,0.04147287
it also introduces a new actress Daphne King soon amazing job oh my gosh love,0.06486605
her so young she's so awesome has a lot of awesome other people in it,0.049004078
too I would HIGHLY highly highly recommend this again if you are looking for a,0.012232062
happier movie this is not the best route to go it's not going to make,0.034164496
you feel happy and warm and bubbly after you leave it's going to make you,0.12774985
feel kind of depressed I feel like super duper like bawling your eyes out half,0.2066852
an hour later but still depressed and potentially a couple tears well the plot of,0.04666729
the thurible if you see in the x-men movies it follows of course the Wolverine,0.041895263
on the story you had a couple standalone movies as well before this one this,0.04029616
one cuts to many many many years in the future when stuff has gone awry,0.021599844
I don't really want to spoil you too much you should really go into this,0.08643862
blind and not really what's happening but the main thing you should know is that,0.03413656
it is many many many many many years into the future so that's why things,0.021233993
seem really different it's not like this has happened a year or two from the,0.019989435
last movie is action drama sci fi has been born at a time it's not,0.05198277
bad or really at all so don't worry about that so if you like action,0.053047065
yes you'll love it if you don't like action well just watch it anyways for,0.057747252
the story because the story is amazing it's really all I can tell you without,0.025090061
completely spoiling you so I'm going to go ahead and jump into the spoilery section,0.32631356
okay thank you for joining me today non spoilery people go watch Logan and then,0.097897075
come back and we can talk about all the fields and everything on it together,0.03285741
have a good day goodbye I know it's not supposed but you know why I,0.024915785
made up one so I don't have the clause I really want a clause so,0.022911586
I went into this expecting it to be bad because I have been warned at,0.06419688
least of that that it is very dark and depressing compared to the other x-men,0.103199914
movies and that's totally fine you need those dark night moments especially in comic book,0.058013327
movies because those are so bright so deep if you're not expected to be as,0.07931118
depressing as it was I gotta say and the engine shocked me I got a,0.07290812
bit hit hope that says automatically at the beginning is just that this very curious,0.054127987
depressing town because the very opening scene is of course Wolverine is getting attacked by,0.12168803
these guys who are trying to steal his car which is a very dumb move,0.268128
and he's fighting them but just something seems off he's not healing as fast and,0.06661083
he seems to be hurting more than usual when the guys hit him for just,0.13986483
kind of wondering the whole time what exactly happened to the x-men and why isn't,0.012861325
he at the school teaching why is he a driver now and everything like that,0.019777905
it's really really confusing it was just so depressing because I was kind of excited,0.066025466
because I was really hoping that I would see some of the other x-men in,0.06123481
this movie but you basically find out right at the beginning that all the rest,0.03520418
of them are dead and it's really Wolverine and Charles Xavier and the creepy guy,0.28404793
who can hunt down mutants Calvin Calvin Gus's name Calvin and you find out there,0.086465225
hasn't either then mutant children in the 25 years or something like that and you're,0.14318876
just like what's going on what happened where's magneto and sore and Cyclops we just,0.05157568
goes back and but it's really there what if he cycle but he's dead again,0.15841548
oh gosh oh I was really sad and on top of that you find out,0.08075529
Professor X is having these seizures that basically can kill everybody so that's really fun,0.48269284
too I did find out information that was interesting because you know I have friends,0.02077435
who read the comics and everything and so I was actually informed that in the,0.017750425
comics I mean they hand shattered they never fully said it but it was Professor,0.114420235
X in one of the comments that actually kill are the x-men because he had,0.1754056
one of those seizures and the Wolverine could heal himself so he was okay but,0.03812234
the rest of them couldn't so they all ended up dying and I wasn't thinking,0.2916794
into that but I did hear that in the actual comics that Wolverine is the,0.019814491
one that kills them all I don't know if any of you guys have read,0.6391699
the comics but if you have you can talk about it below a little bit,0.05375881
because I'd like to know that in more detail because I'm not going to hunt,0.095778465
down those comics and figure out exactly what happened so it's that stuff I like,0.056923755
but like lip spoiler can't email people don't want to read about the comics themselves,0.03450241
and don't want to be spoiled for them and then you find out that there,0.031120617
are other mutant children out there you come across Laura who is played by Daphne,0.1298372
was amazing amazing Wolverine takes her in and promises to get her to this place,0.104507
called Eden but you're kind of wondering this whole time what is her power exactly,0.02669249
and I was like shocked when I found out that she basically is Wolverine junior,0.038066465
girl version and she's more enhanced in a way because she had claws coming out,0.21145655
of her feet Wolverine only has at hand she has them in her feet too,0.0524484
I was like wait a second did Wolverine have a kick I was really confused,0.046123832
I did not expect that to be her power out of everything so I was,0.036561154
freaking out and thinking it was awesome and she was awesome like those fight sequences,0.12769198
that she had especially at the beginning when they attack them in Mexico oh my,0.35557333
god that was so good almost time to watch her because she's just a little,0.067417696
little spunky thing and she's gonna grow little new it's really cool and I wish,0.30693346
I had those girls a little bit but I don't and then the whole time,0.23988754
I was like okay so she's gotta be boring kid healthy sorta miss but isn't,0.16670235
she's like a clone actually did not but I was ed said that he had,0.12327183
a kid and I was like this is gene great kid I'm gonna cut up,0.15091486
I have these psychic powers along with the claws like I was determined for life,0.047815397
to happen because if you don't know who she and gray is because you haven't,0.044788145
left me other x-men movies for some reason she's the main love interest for loking,0.12863255
he's with Cyclops technically and she never breaks up the Cyclops never will but Logan,0.0319215
has a crush on her and wants to be with her there's been a gap,0.32878324
since the last movie and this one and she was alive last time I saw,0.059831273
because they revs arrested her and everything does that mean that they had a kid,0.120572515
and he didn't know about and the kid got captured I was going down that,0.030417517
hole and I erupted that is not true family but I really wanted it to,0.067592636
be true which is bad because I love Cyclops at the same time I wanted,0.06175166
her to actually be Logan daughter that's why I just really wanted to actually be,0.059756108
looking sorry and Professor X didn't help because he's like that's your daughter Logan and,0.09318225
I'm like oh I'm right I'm right but no find out that you have all,0.029716413
of these young mutant kids that were in this facility and being tortured and basically,0.48694167
turned into weapons and then they escaped and are heading off to eat in logan,0.043420527
task now is to bring laura to eating and he has to bring professor x,0.10113652
with him which is scary in itself because his seizures and everything and i loved,0.1393726
how the movie didn't because i didn't know when they were going to happen but,0.030981593
he did it so well in moments where you were just not expecting it at,0.047230035
all like the main one was when they were in that hotel he has the,0.029513532
seizure all of a sudden and you see everybody's like frozen and the whole time,0.07010437
you're just watching Logan struggle to try and get to that hotel room so he,0.0574865
can stop professor eggs from killing everybody that's being probably tortured me out of all,0.5936239
the other scene you're just walking you move in and you're like can you move,0.10048397
just a little bit faster he couldn't move faster not like everybody's gonna die there's,0.31982592
gonna be a whole scene this is not okay and then the action sequence was,0.023929317
really cool because he comes in and he's like boom like that could have guys,0.078603424
and then they fall under dead and I was just like this is so cool,0.28609276
oh my gosh stop the seizure from happening please he just had a sense of,0.10029772
dread everywhere they went because when they hope that one family on the side of,0.037970014
the road I was kind of what Wolverine and I was like we should really,0.054092735
move on because I was gonna happen to the family the way this movie is,0.044739585
going and what do you know I was right though I did think for a,0.024674987
second that the kid was actually going to be another mutant you would see Laura's,0.082551286
like powers and then human be like oh my gosh look what I can do,0.15970194
and then he joins them or something like that I'm not sure but I do,0.04636796
not think all of them would survive I was clearly right I did not expect,0.078555524
to be their clone of Logan that is stronger and how he should be in,0.04636862
the sense and I was just terrified at that thing because asking was just plain,0.09156719
unstoppable it was it was scary okay you're not going to beat yourself I'm sorry,0.27571046
that other self is way stronger than you and then a shock came for me,0.19428284
at that moment though that thing that duplicate kills Professor X and I was so,0.23534037
mad I was like no we only have two people that are left in this,0.07634712
mutant world well three now but still I'll be original you're going to kill one,0.6348082
of those right now there is not okay and who is Professor X out of,0.048070163
all the people that you just killed I was so pissed and I was really,0.6240216
sad because he was dying and Logan was trying to save them but there was,0.049366605
nothing that Logan to do you know I'm like now it's just human Laura and,0.059430167
then Logan also knows that evening is actually a thing from the comics which was,0.008405926
frustrating I was like there's no such thing as hidden you gotta be kidding me,0.06594498
and I'm just panicking whew the whole entire time because I'm like they're gonna get,0.029041918
Laura and he's going to have to try down and this is not going to,0.029422402
be good ha is a better than that was me that was me during the,0.031144563
whole movie basically okay this was one comedic part for me was when Laura finally,0.017508963
speaks Logan Gibson because he's like you can't show off this whole entire time and,0.095397316
then she just goes on a rant in Spanish and I was laughing hysterically -,0.09226829
me / Laura you are awesome and kicking butt yes I loved it and then,0.66255265
also during all of the sudden happening you have this impending genome with Wolverine because,0.032811515
he's not healing well and that's really scary but you don't know exactly what is,0.026948584
going on with him and you don't know if they're going to make it but,0.051123355
of course they were able to get him to the Eden which was kind of,0.024757471
Eden but not really and the kids are the ones who end up nurturing him,0.03798132
back to health in a sense and you're just like yes okay everything's gonna be,0.17491603
okay Wolverines going to go let them protect them everything's going to be good and,0.057111338
there's going to be a whole new little mutants game but then the last sequence,0.051776566
came up and oh my gosh I was super intense and heartbreaking and intense again,0.08724615
Laureen who wakes up and realizes that that these kids are going to get captured,0.028139928
and so Wolverine takes the medicine all at once which he was not supposed to,0.029377835
do and you have this moment of old Wolverine where he's so strong and unstoppable,0.032656524
and it's this really nice battle sequence because you have him and then you have,0.0381403
Laura both kicking butt together and working together and I know she's not his daughter,0.47905737
in a sense but it was like father and daughter working together then the medicine,0.03388645
starts to wear off and let's do the Logan clothes Dylan is dead and he's,0.080120705
beating him to a pulp and got run oh my gosh thought run was so,0.46165198
pitiful at the end and I was just like this is so fast I paced,0.10737461
disintegrating basically back to where he was at the beginning but work is so painful,0.090521514
to watch and so emotional because you see him fighting and you have all the,0.048090782
other mutants coming together they're so young but they're fighting for Wolverine to protect him,0.09234346
and for each other and they come together and finally repeat that stupid Logan clones,0.5533539
but the real low game is so injured that they cannot do anything for him,0.070835404
and you just have this such emotional tender moment between him and Laura where she's,0.022116026
crying and not wanting him to go away because he is her guy in a,0.13862427
sense you just don't realize fully what's going to happen until it does because I,0.060892243
don't know about you but in superhero movies I don't expect my main character to,0.028967418
die and so I'm like he's going to be okay they're going to have one,0.5746634
of the mutants like heal him or something and he's going to be fine and,0.06391417
he's going to lead them to the border and everything's going to be fine but,0.053454157
it wasn't okay I cried I literally cried because Wolverine died he's going to be,0.22565182
resurrected or something because that's what they did in Superman so what you'll be doing,0.08825324
with Wolverine but no they ended with him dying and I was just sitting there,0.06337404
in silence for a good ten minutes afterwards and hearing my mom go like that,0.20420739
did that was funny that saw me out of it that that was funny she,0.06824651
literally was really upset that he died in that with it and I tried to,0.14184774
explain her it was hit the last movie but she was like that's not okay,0.07600389
that he died and she walked away pretty angry that night that that was how,0.13568749
it ended with him suck all of them it's more than just him dying by,0.7295027
himself because a Wolverine has been a central figure of the x-men franchise for such,0.06266895
a long time and so that in itself is really hurtful but also knowing that,0.024179425
he was the last original x-men and the last original guys and this the stars,0.036756054
these whole new mutants which is cool and giving white to future x-men possibilities and,0.27761602
new mutants and everything but it's still so sad that all of the originals are,0.07452319
dead now ah I'm going to miss them and the thing about that character is,0.09595407
that it's such an iconic character there's not really anybody else I feel like that,0.019377464
can take Hugh Jackman's place as Wolverine I don't they are going to because I,0.056606464
know they're doing younger versions of some of the x-men people now like Cyclops and,0.09952943
Jean Grey Sansa Stark is Jean Grey people I don't know if they're actually going,0.050258614
to do a younger Wolverine look out of all the characters Hugh Jackman has been,0.03452037
the central figure of that and he's done so much with Wolverine and you've come,0.03623455
to his close but I'm guessing they're going to fill that gap basically between that,0.04983822
time and go back and refer a very and fill in some other time places,0.06398335
that they can because we're doing younger versions of everybody I will say I was,0.029264754
really sad that Wolverine died and that broke my heart but it was still a,0.07413339
really good send-off makes me want to go back to the beginning of x-men and,0.24687617
see everything he's done the best thank you Hugh Jackman from being an awesome awesome,0.029074512
Wolverine that is really all I have to say about this movie it was so,0.0387689
incredible very emotional intense has little cute moments has very very depressing moments but it's,0.077119395
still so good and a great send-off to Wolverine and what Hugh Jackman has done,0.06867689
with that character thank you so much for watching this if you have any other,0.016762627
book or movie recommendations you can leave them in the comments below and I'll write,0.03860726
them down check them out and make sure I do review on them for you,0.1362968
thank you so much for everything have a wonderful day evening night afternoon whatever time,0.037308156
of the day you are watching this end don't forget to be awesome and watch,0.051426012
Wolverine and if you have Wolverine claws oh my gosh show me them because I,0.141736
want some like to put on the hip that'd be so much fun alright have,0.096415706
