this is a movie that really makes me appreciate directors like Spike Lee people who won't crumble on a devastating horrors that are happening under the current administration but who are brave and also provocative enough to create something that pushes back this is black lensman Knights of the Ku Klux Klan that's us [Music] sailes Fonda my name's Jimmy cage and in his newest film filmmaker Spike Lee tells one hell of a true story or as they put it this joint is based upon some for real for real shi'ite black Landsman tells a story of Ron's Tara worth the first african-american police officer and detective in a Colorado Springs Police Department who successfully infiltrated the local Ku Klux Klan this sounds totally bonkers and I still remember that I thought this would be a comedy when I first heard about the project some time ago and it does indeed feature a lot of humor but at its heart it's a very frightening and heavy crime drama the actual events that it's based on took place in 1979 but a fool moved him back seven years to 1972 to incorporate the then trendy blaxploitation movies as well as the re-election campaign of President Nixon which supposedly was supported by the Klan and I think it's quite important to mention because I haven't seen a movie in a long time that blurred the lines between art and real life as much and as fascinating as this film does right from the beginning it confronts the audience with images and sounds of DW Griffith's 1915 air Post The Birth of a Nation and movie debt is held in high regards when it comes to its groundbreaking influential new storytelling techniques but it's also one of the most notorious ones in film history because of its racist overtones and the glorification of the Ku Klux Klan which was a major reason for the real Klan to gain power again black Landsman begins where the white supremacist using material to forward his agenda and is played by Alec Baldwin right now Baldwin is probably the most prominent Donald Trump impersonator in the entertainment industry and a connection to the current president is an association that's very easy to make and is always political to a certain degree and from Spike Lee who made such powerful films like do the right thing or Malcolm X I wouldn't expect any less than a direct comment and of course criticism of Trump's presidency I don't want to take away the ending of the film and I heard before that some people think it's immensely powerful while other argue it's too much and not sorry I can only speak for myself but I found it to be perfect and bald and incredibly heart-wrenching but most importantly important and necessary maybe not absolutely necessary for the film but necessary for our times right now and it goes without saying that a whole film and the themes of race and bigotry couldn't be more timely and as applies not just to the USA but a humanity on a global level the film comes back to birth of a nation at a very crucial moment later on alongside a small but important role played by the legendary Harry Belafonte who was an early supporter of the civil rights movement the film also like ascent features some blaxploitation references like for example the movie shaft it also makes several rather obvious allusions to Trump like for example his whole make America great again stick the casting of John David washing and lead alone is quite special too because he's the son of Denzel Washington with whom Spike Lee worked for terms in the past most notably probably for Malcolm X it's also very nice to see Topher Grace back in the 70s he portrays David Duke who at the time was the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and yes that's really the official term and it has also true that a real ronster birth did indeed spoke with Luke over the phone who of course assumed that he was talking to a white guy it's also fact that ster was infiltrated the Klan with the help of a white surrogate in reality they were actually two people and to the state there's not much known about them in the film it's a Jewish detective Flip Zimmerman played by Adam driver by making him Jewish and of course playing a lot with the clans hatred for Jews the film adds another layer we have one person who is considered to be a lesser human being by the stupid races of the Klan and they can easily recognize him because of his appearance alone and then we have one person who is almost s hated by them but their twisted minds have no chance to spot him just by looks there are many tense moments arising from that and the film is short and directed in a way that's really seductive for one Spike Lee really succeeds in creating a feeling for the 70s it was shot on home on location and another key players the score by Terence Blanchard sometimes haunting and brooding sometimes very cool and lean back I'm not a big expert on Spike Lee but from what I've seen he often uses rather recognizable but also often quite powerful techniques to emphasize certain aspects in an early sequence where we together with one stare worth experience a speech by Stokely Carmichael aka Kwame ture Lee highlights certain phases in the audience to show the effect on those people and probably also to underline they're coming together and maybe the intimacy and empowering they felt in that moment there are also a few instances where Lee shows a certain brief action for example hanging up the phone from two different perspectives in quick succession over all black Landsman is taught in a playful fashion and even though the narrative fits a bit and even at times it never ever lost my interest which can be attributed to the fascinating story the great performances and Lee's Direction not everything is coming together perfectly the relationship to lower Harriers character Patrice Tomas who is the president of the Black Student Union for example feels a bit under written and there are also some story progressions that didn't seem off that logical to me while watching I thought it was fine because I didn't know what was actually true and what was exaggerated or added for the film version but now in that respect I guess some elements could have been handled better because what a basic story about a black guy who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan is what happened pretty much everything else including most characters and also the whole finale is fiction and that's not a bad thing after all this is art and it takes something from reality to create something that shines a light back on it and I think it's a very bright light maybe the comparison is a bit far-fetched but it's the first thing that came to my mind and I don't think it's that bad I know that Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino aren't really on good terms but away Lee created something extraordinary basing his film on this true story Tarantino did his own version of world war two with inglorious basterds and I think both films are very entertaining and thought-provoking and empowering at the same time so in German I'd say Spike Lee's matte black Landsman village taka finger loom tetsaiga Mesa Vista ganas I encounter Astra wish aunt
