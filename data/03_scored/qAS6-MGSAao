now the Irishman is supposed to be Netflix's movie right it's three and a half,0.088622525
hours long it has a hundred and sixty million dollar budget it has fancy new,0.13245259
D aging VFX front and center in a year where that's all the rage right,0.14975666
some of Hollywood's most legendary talent and a sophisticated debut at the New York Film,0.059942383
Festival in fact they even had the press screening at Alice Tully Hall where the,0.020060658
film will debut this evening and they hardly ever do that for press they cram,0.09084756
us into the wall to read so that was that was real nice and because,0.06262984
I think they wanted everyone including the critics to feel that this is a movie,0.055393584
Scorsese lobbied hard but failed to get it a theatrical wide release but the theater,0.15288366
owners still really hate Netflix because they won't do at least like a two-month window,0.31137785
before digital release I think this is only gonna be like two weeks right theaters,0.09279251
before you can watch it on streaming but Netflix is rumored to have actually bought,0.077710755
the Paris theater here in New York City a prestige venue for this very movie,0.054709215
but ironically I think this is actually better suited for streaming and I think that's,0.11979846
actually the case with Romo as well both are a long slog like wow like,0.12220926
remember how a lot of you wrote me and said like I had a hard,0.1819433
time getting through Romo Grace and I felt at the end it was worth it,0.06534065
some of you agreed with me some of you didn't some of you never made,0.15532589
it to the end of Romo and I think it's a similar situation with the,0.09340239
Irishman now I think that because this is an English it's in color right and,0.08646267
it has Hollywood actors with the more commercial storytelling and performances it'll probably be better,0.05576792
received by audiences overall than Romo was right I think more people will get to,0.07723664
the end of this movie now as for award season I don't know I think,0.08933579
that its strongest bet is a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Joe Pesci who is,0.06701246
wonderfully understated here I was really impressed with his work it's in stark contrast to,0.08327927
his other iconic Scorsese performance in good which he already want an Oscar for so,0.09263832
I don't know if he's gonna win an Oscar here again for the same director,0.13135523
but I'm very maybe because it's such a different role he could and also Pesci,0.09072624
was uh nominated for Scorsese's Raging Bull so there's a very not only is there,0.12966819
are good awards history there voters love that kind of stuff but it's a very,0.05227806
good actor director collaboration indeed Scorsese actually looks after a number of actors but this,0.060150072
you know maybe this being just so different than Pesci's iconic persona right it was,0.0850957
funny in fact to sometimes watch them cuz it's so long and someone sometimes it's,0.11474931
not that good we're gonna talk about that sometimes it's very good but in some,0.100078516
of the slower moments I was like it's so funny that's Harry from home alone,0.05878806
hilarious he's Joe Pesci favorite character in the movie he's so adorable well they you,0.12847735
know but it towards the end when he was like a grandpa's I was this,0.1553585
one to go the whole movie I wanted to scope and give him a hug,0.068287514
he was so awesome and he had like a cool look he actually had glasses,0.0897472
a little bit like my new glasses maybe that maybe that's why I felt a,0.105360046
kinship with him alright so obviously the big question is how successful is the D,0.10018846
aging VFX right which is supposedly responsible for the sky-high budget although I think a,0.056114126
lot of people got paid big time here talk about the mob to do it,0.11556401
this on Netflix although you know nobody else really wanted to foot the budget right,0.15960923
I believe that was the that was a situation although seeing the movie I wouldn't,0.043341115
paid one hundred and sixty million dollars for this either as speaking of the aging,0.0911788
as I said in my trailer reaction for this movie I find it ironic that,0.07852446
if this technology existed back in the 1970s DeNiro never would have gotten his big,0.09807264
breakout role as young Vito Corleone Marlon Brando just would have played the role himself,0.079158306
although I don't know Marlon Brando would have gone along with this he'd be like,0.1564841
no thank you especially maybe after he saw how it turned out when they showed,0.09208451
him the test he'd be like it doesn't even work I don't really think that,0.12421313
it does in some shots it does but then it's weird cuz the very next,0.31089434
shot you're like did you turn off the D aging and they're like it's just,0.7093121
not as clean some shots what do you want from us so De Niro and,0.23966229
Pesci here play the younger versions of themselves and they cover quite a long their,0.10310069
lives acting-wise I think they do that very well but technology wise well the face,0.13984472
D aging is again somewhat effective all Scorsese accomplishes is putting young faces on older,0.14926875
bodies both in how they look and how they move I don't know if you,0.16472833
saw the reason I didn't notice it as much in Captain Marvel but the recent,0.06033156
honest trailer for that pointed out that Sam Jackson even types like like an older,0.16417086
gentleman despite the D aging on his face but here you really notice it particularly,0.31089434
the first D H seen they have De Niro and Pesci working on a truck,0.1514574
engine and in the close-ups there their hands are noticeably the hands of you know,0.112432234
guys who are as old as of Pesci and De Niro actually are so that,0.41035786
was it was just it was just jarring and you're like I don't know if,0.15416074
this was worth it I mean they could have just dyed their hair black as,0.44591773
I think they did to some degree and it would have been the same thing,0.07737083
but thankfully De Niro Pesci and mr. Al Pacino are legendary for being their own,0.11787381
best special effects and what keeps this movie interesting throughout are their incredible performances not,0.07141192
just incredible but it's interesting to see all three of them play roles that are,0.05228471
so different than how we are famous for knowing them right so De Niro is,0.048220493
differential right a soldier instead of a general and the army analogy to the mob,0.10748245
is used I think very effectively subtly but I think effectively the movies very subtle,0.07404234
in many regards I wonder how much people will actually pick up about what it's,0.07490411
saying I picked up a lot and I still found it kind of boring in,0.15289007
places all right so Pesci is calm collected and a respected leader I know and,0.055551108
Pacino is totally out of control but also a total lovable softie ah he was,0.13444918
so sweet but by the way his supposedly emphasis on supposedly Midwestern accent was all,0.05441758
over the place sometimes it decided to show up to say sometimes it didn't I'd,0.051681112
be like just forget it al you can't do it consistently so forget it I,0.07580093
guess there's I forget the accents forget the D aging technology this is just a,0.04795922
very good play which is I think is also good way to sit smallest good,0.08947149
streaming show that's a good way to describe it I also appreciated the history of,0.061001554
the mob Hoffa and the Kennedys you know that's not very rarely delved into and,0.11790313
as the movie continually points out many people today don't even know who Jimmy Hoffa,0.13949713
is and I think cuz they're focusing on how uh instead of perhaps the Kennedys,0.110380016
part of the story that's very much in the background and not until like the,0.056766182
second half for the last third of the last hour or so or the movie,0.060518537
I don't know how riveted it will be for people who aren't into history but,0.11895075
I like history so I thought that stuff was cool I also like the subtle,0.07718502
revelation again sometimes the movie might be too subtle for its own good but I,0.056767963
like this connection that banks back in the day couldn't get involved in gambling so,0.06472392
they couldn't invest in casinos and such fare so that left that left an opening,0.05578601
for the mob but today of course banks and all businesses are involved in all,0.07249946
kinds of shady dealings with often government involvement so there's no business left for the,0.07147221
mob and as I said that's really interesting when you think about it so I,0.11654458
liked that takeaway there also as is usually the case with this type of movie,0.08617792
plenty of little and big life lessons to learn and some scenes sprinkled throughout as,0.07618653
I said the movie has some serious laws but there are scenes here and there,0.044041604
with almost Tarantino level dialogue and shoot again far not throughout not consistent but there,0.2256458
were a lot of scenes where people in the audience was laughing very hard myself,0.16558632
included very good De Niro and Pesci also shine showing their characters towards the end,0.09404001
of their lives the passage of time physically mentally and this is a zinger emotionally,0.24342711
I was pretty blown away the final few scenes are incredibly moving really I mean,0.23203237
I've told you before you want to open your movie strong and you want to,0.1494518
end your movie strong I think the movie did kind of open strong open strong,0.11755049
but it ended I'm sure that it ended very strong and I think that'll help,0.060629144
how people remember it again if you get you'll get to the end of a,0.07290758
Scorsese movie it might take you a few days but you'll get there and I,0.15203655
thought that the ending was so moving that I think it could end up getting,0.08455819
De Niro and acting nomination as well I don't know about a win the passage,0.123240635
of time was very convincing and he does have some really strong emotional scenes like,0.05631996
really like a gift to an actor even though I thought at the beginning he,0.0716183
was hamming it up a little bit so I don't think he's a strong contender,0.1893268
but I think he's in the mix but speaking of senior citizens the movie is,0.058673125
set up like you're visiting grandpa the senior at the Senior Center and boy to,0.08781437
see you have a story to tell you which is an excellent framing device it's,0.093353026
a it's really a very clever framing device and it's very well set up but,0.09557806
you know what's not so great choosing to have the pacing and the energy of,0.079168916
a story that grandpa tells you I mean as I said the movie is super,0.17108569
slow and feels super long and I actually almost dozed off I got very little,0.1286115
sleep last night but still if it had been a really good movie I would,0.1289175
have paid attention but I was like really fighting to stay awake towards the end,0.07509804
of the second hour whoa I mean it really was like spending a few hours,0.082016505
at your grandparents house because if again the pacing the energy the sex the actors,0.527427
it was it was it was office a little surreal in that regard and also,0.06406057
speaking of The Godfather Part two again that's also three plus hours I recently watched,0.055508982
it for the Labor Day weekend went down to Little Italy had some dinner then,0.15094653
watched The Godfather Part two which has a lot of scene and seems a little,0.054418895
italy fabulous evening and I was riveted to that movie the entire time never lost,0.1998633
a step loved it and while this is a very long movie oddly Scorsese has,0.077712744
made it a very small movie in scope the cinematography the locations none of it,0.07095527
warrants the big screen in fact this could easily be a four episode streaming series,0.04391393
on Netflix which is what it basically is also well it's a different story the,0.026543707
movie is so similar to The Godfather films the first two and Goodfellas etc with,0.07278244
the same actors but that also keeps them it keeps it from feeling fresh and,0.060595676
new the movie is very funny again as I said and has some surprisingly fun,0.07147392
turns from Steven Graham who we all know plays a very good mobster but also,0.2927783
Ray Romano was used incredibly well here I love gray Romano here and there are,0.060442325
some cameos really great cameos sprinkled throughout a lot of times like oh look who,0.121236674
it is oh look look I love that person awesome now obviously in a movie,0.11688735
like this the women's roles aren't great although Goodfellas of course had a pretty strong,0.29122618
female role and I guess uh Diane Keaton was so annoying and the Godfather movies,0.5154597
it's a little bit hard to include her as well but here I thought Katherine,0.24050571
Narducci as Pesci's wife made an impression and it was nice to see dascha Polanco,0.15216324
from orange is the new black even if it was just for one scene she,0.2402063
stood out though good for her she made the most of it so I definitely,0.11246381
watch the Irishman I just stream it and as I said you might might want,0.122070275
to make it a two-night event you might be like no grace I want to,0.24037626
power through it I'm gonna watch this whole thing in one night cuz it's a,0.09890748
Scorsese movie damn it but I bet you you fall asleep and you'll have to,0.8516939
watch it the next night unless you start it like speaking of senior citizens you,0.096582785
start it like a four o'clock maybe then you could do it maybe you'd be,0.15453878
a good after Sunday afternoon movie which is how I recommended you watch Romo by,0.06768415
the way I watched Romo myself on a rainy Sunday I was like let's try,0.2859392
this again because the credits were so long I'd finished my dinner one evening trying,0.10594019
to watch it and I was like forget this so I went back on a,0.057646185
rainy afternoon and I watched the whole thing all the way through and ice again,0.06687348
again as I said I felt it was worth it and I would describe the,0.08157408
Irishman the same way for both the positive and the negative so that's my review,0.11570339
of the Irishman very curious tear your thoughts down below be sure to hit that,0.31089434
