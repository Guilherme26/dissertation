Roma the 2018 film directed by Alfonso Koran who directed movies such as children of men as well as the film gravity,0.04610801
now this is a real passion project for this guy he wrote and directed this film and it's something he wanted to make for a very long time,0.12109426
now this is a black and white foreign film set in Mexico in a different language,0.050129037
so a lot of people might have a hard time getting into it,0.10660232
because of that now this film was on various film festivals where it won some of them,0.07483665
and was very well received,0.05165707
and now it was picked up by Netflix and what's good,0.06312238
I guess is that Netflix is going to open up this film to a lot more people that otherwise wouldn't see it because a lot of these foreign films don't really get seen by wider audiences,0.09133544
so that is pretty good Hurra lead actress in this film is yalitza apprec I and she was really good as the maid Cleo in this film she had a very quiet,0.113320015
reserved miss to her performance but you can tell so much about just the expressions on her face,0.16130862
and the way she carries herself through these various scenes,0.13026975
she was really good,0.09261683
now this movie is set in the 1970s in Mexico City,0.056162722
and it follows the life of this middle-class family and they're made for an entire year,0.09277413
now,0.03121897
there's not much of an overall plot per se is more,0.07988952
so just like you're living which with this family and you're very immersed in their life for this time period,0.23811851
now I have to say this has got to be one of the most overhyped films I've ever seen love reviews are calling this a richly textured masterpiece the most exquisite and artistic film of the year the best picture of the year the best film of the decade,0.052139137
some people saying this movie brought them to tears people saying that this is just like the greatest movie ever made so going into this film,0.11488343
my expectations were super super high,0.06972116
and I when I came out of it I felt honestly kind of sonot and i almost feel like I'm going to be attacked or there's something wrong with me because I did not love this movie like so many people did,0.2545073
so that's where I'm a little bit at a crossroads with this film and the overhype did not really help matters,0.05988892
now I have to say there still are a lot of positives of this film it is well directed,0.17269585
there are some beautiful shots in this some scenes that come to mind are this Ocean Beach shot,0.17814548
this tracking shot where they made is on this Beach,0.15386726
and then all of a sudden one of the kids is drowning,0.34658694
so she goes and runs into the ocean,0.2409469
and the way this tracking shot just follows her from the beach over the water into the ocean and then back again or sometimes she's the characters are just moving through the streets of Mexico City,0.09047864
and we have this tracking shot over the streets beautiful stuff,0.4032544
there there's this one scene where Cleo the maid is giving birth and we're on her for such a really long time,0.15364723
and I mean really beautiful cinematography in this film there's another scene where they're in a movie theater and it's like this really long shot of that and we see these characters in the background just these background characters and they almost have their own little stories and it's like things going on there that you can almost just watch this couple making out in front of them a few rows ahead and they have their almost own little story,0.075830996
you know they're just in the background so stuff like that was really great,0.11627657
now on to some of the negatives for this film while it is very immersive following this family and seeing their real life,0.10019973
it is also just very mundane and boring and there's really not much of a story here,0.15375969
now this is a very long movie two hours and 15 minutes,0.10995219
but I think they only have about an hour worth of story here and it just drags out for that long runtime because the director loves to indulge himself with these long shots,0.12598856
now this movie opens up you have four minutes of just seeing this water on the floor,0.1336866
the intro credits are rolling apparently you know the maid is mopping but it's four minutes of just watching water splash on the floor,0.0840546
finally we pan up to the maid,0.09552772
and then we slowly watch her bring the mop down this hallway,0.20853654
and then she puts it in this little like storage closet or something,0.18523227
and she goes inside this closet and she shuts the door and then it is literally a 30-second shot of this doorway and where she's maybe changing in there or something but it's literally 30 seconds of the movie of just this doorway nothing else,0.2629069
she finally comes out of that doorway and then she goes into the house so we're talking to be the first six minutes or so of the movie and we've done nothing finally she's walking through the house and we see her clean a bit finally have some interactions with the kids,0.18368681
but a lot of the movie is just this,0.0717227
these long drawn-out shots that go on forever mind you it looked beautiful,0.35707298
the some of these shots were very nice,0.19574764
but he's really stretching the time here and so much of the movie is just that,0.07052571
it's these super long shots done because they look beautiful but they have no real merit to the overall story sometimes and they're what I like to call masturbatory directing,0.72476536
it's the director kind of indulging himself and saying oh this is going to look beautiful and really taking his time to do these long shots but not adding much to the overall story and it really really drags out the story at times and makes it slow and very kind of boring,0.21007836
now when I got to the midway point of this movie I really wanted to bail I wanted to bail on this movie but it was all of these positive reviews calling this the best film of the decade that made me be like,0.06592823
no,0.06626663
I have to sit through this movie and see it through to the end to see how good or bad this movie really is,0.13024397
so I watched the entire thing and I never really got over that slow,0.13088533
miss of the movie and these long scenes,0.09505764
so while they look technically beautiful,0.08793826
there is not much here to this overall story and it can really drag on at times overall,0.09176248
while I from an intellectual perspective appreciated the artistic Ness of this film it was too drawn-out and boring and suffered from a director masturbating to his own work metaphorically speaking I did not love this movie I liked it,0.7957228
and I think it is worth watching to see some of these scenes but I did not love it and it is not my favorite film of the year and it is okay to not like this movie as well it is okay to love this movie if you're super into it as well but for me I would give this film a 7.5 out of 10 not too bad but not the greatest film of the decade [Applause],0.0784132
