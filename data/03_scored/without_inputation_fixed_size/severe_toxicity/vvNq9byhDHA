there has been a crime I paid to see one movie but discovered another the,0.04632206
old switcharoo mr. Ron Johnson continues to subvert expectations indeed who gets the most screen,0.02634593
time why this little later right here back of the poster before the plot thickens,0.03524276
this must be how this low-budget movie could afford all these actors who actually have,0.05203665
very little screen time she also appears very little in the trailer a trailer for,0.022538418
whoever cut it should be paid most handsomely yes that voice is fun to do,0.23472461
I see you Daniel Craig I wish she done it more everyone has so little,0.031750545
screen time and clinic take a quick place the detective anyway how did I like,0.0570089
the movie we actually got well it's hard for me to tell because I really,0.032736346
couldn't get over my disappointment and not getting the all-star ensemble murder mystery I had,0.08372933
been promised from the trailers I didn't live other trailer started out but I thought,0.031318177
the last couple of trailers were amazing and they've been playing it so often I've,0.025334185
seen it in front of so many movies and every time it played I'd be,0.026187615
like I can't wait to see this movie so they whipped me up into a,0.059039705
frenzy and then and typical Rian Johnson you know but playbook then he switched it,0.034000862
on me wasn't what I wanted speaking of being blindsided blindsided this film's strong political,0.08283
commentary was also a surprise and it must be why Lionsgate is trying to float,0.019198531
it in as an awards contender it's been on the festival circuit I'm gonna invite,0.06264167
you to award screenings and I've been like not knives out really now that I've,0.07785043
seen it I get it and I also suspect that's why it's getting such overwhelmingly,0.03246362
strong reviews now I don't mind political films at all in fact I quite enjoy,0.03882943
them but again I did not appreciate the bait-and-switch and also this movie is very,0.02698384
aggressive and I'd say somewhat mean-spirited in its commentary I mean I kind of liked,0.16213253
what some of what it was saying I'm still not totally sure by the way,0.037664693
what it is saying but I thought it's like you don't have to insult me,0.052600063
while you're making your point Ryan right I mean after what happened with how he,0.021075679
dealt with the Star Wars fans who are unhappy with the last Jedi you would,0.035928566
think he would have learned his lesson but instead he seems to have doubled down,0.053047065
you know how he tweets about Star Wars well that's how he deals with this,0.015380376
situation as well and I even like the last Jedi but he made so many,0.01944864
people upset and I don't like I don't think he handled himself very well and,0.05183909
in that in that situation and I don't like how he's handling himself here to,0.022426002
be honest with you now speaking of Star Wars yes Johnson really does continue to,0.015875937
love to subvert expectations but not just with the trailer but the mystery and the,0.02664127
movie itself don't worry no spoilers but I wouldn't even call this a murder mystery,0.10087377
to be honest with you and I discovered that I would say halfway through it,0.05135883
when the movie wants you to and I was really disappointed in that revelation I,0.04264027
was like it's not even a murder mystery are you kidding me I'd say it's,0.15921636
more of a political thriller well thriller with like political straw very strong not at,0.050716925
all hidden undertones and Johnson's choices and twists I'd say are a little too clever,0.031171836
so much so that I had not only found them disappointing but I think they,0.06663344
stuck a lot of energy out of the film you're like I don't even know,0.100728095
what this is anymore in fact it's one the film which starts out very strong,0.025923537
by the way so when you start watching this movie you'll be like Oh grace,0.08824858
Iran but then you'll be like Moomin God but when it switches for my ensemble,0.12868044
and turns more into a film about honored to are mrs. Marta that's when it,0.02707497
slows down considerably and loses its energy and it's really unfair to de Armas by,0.062456753
the way I've been a fan of her since war dogs she was so good,0.22518535
in that movie I thought she really stood out and what's usually a typical girlfriend,0.042252466
role and I thought she did a great job Blade Runner 2049 movie I had,0.028780501
problems with but I thought she was very good the acting was not one of,0.053939078
the problems with that movie some of you really liked Blade Runner 2049 some of,0.064087115
you really liked this movie so I'll be curious to hear your thoughts about it,0.043522302
down below but anyway I think Ana de Armas is very talented and very likable,0.15321174
but here she plays a character with so little agency well it's the type of,0.022486534
female character we're trying to get away from you know in entertainment you know like,0.059492696
I don't want to give too much away but I found it frustrating the type,0.030835252
of woman she was playing also to make her the face of such harsh commentary,0.16173674
I mean it's not it's not doing her any favors I would say strikingly similar,0.076325834
when think about it - how ryan johnson hung poor kelly marie melt tell him,0.12361174
a reet ran out to dry in the last Jedi I mean she's already looking,0.056824643
better with JJ Abrams the stewardship you know I think telling Miri Tran you know,0.06725938
also didn't handle the situation as well as she could have although it was new,0.020483665
to her I think she was unexpected I think think it's understandable and she already,0.10568571
looked so much better here I said in my commentary in the last Jedi the,0.03096962
Kelly Marie Tran was given very poor lines she was given very unfortunate you know,0.088964984
hairstyle and costume design and she was made the face of something that was very,0.06638067
aggressively trying to change what Star Wars lives and that was you know it was,0.019788548
unfortunate and I feel come bad because I think Anand Armas is like in the,0.051250406
same situation here now as for the rest of the cast they're clearly all having,0.02771155
a great time right and for the little for the little time that they're on,0.025787175
screen and Johnson has assembled such a strong group of personalities here who are all,0.016092788
very talented actors that they're limited scenes can't help but be enjoyable but I will,0.072907455
say that you've seen most of their best moments in the trailer in the trailers,0.024964342
a Frank Oz though he shows up briefly and is a delight but he's like,0.027849244
he's got two scenes and like a handful of wines but the production design they,0.024842614
that team also deserves a shout out because they do I think maybe even the,0.10580677
best work here the costume design - it's a beautiful stunning and really you know,0.04053829
a film with so much dimension I guess I would say the thrombi of State,0.1213428
and the thrombi family are really they're an amazing amazingly well realized murder mystery setting,0.3133461
and cast of characters I mean one point Lee Keith Stanfield has a great line,0.010718104
when he says it's like a living clue board and it really is it's so,0.020888763
cool and it's unfortunate that it never lives up to that but it's still even,0.039589737
the promise of that throughout the film is enjoyable to watch you're like any minute,0.031537022
now it never happens but I was still coldest it was still a cool place,0.03369421
to be are so so yes this is a political thriller and murder mystery clothing,0.24654154
only but that clothing again makes the film somewhat enjoyable throughout I still maintained by,0.015140245
the way that this is a fun movie to see for the Thanksgiving holiday even,0.025723318
with its problems it's still it's still so Thanksgiving you and so much about like,0.04428327
family fighting that I think it's a fun choice but if you don't see it,0.060992684
during the Thanksgiving holiday or if you're in a country where they don't have Thanksgiving,0.019696089
I don't necessarily know if it's worth paying to see it in theaters when there,0.015056432
are so many other great choices out there go see Ford versus Ferrari ah the,0.011642044
good parts though here are good enough good enough that I would not I would,0.07058131
not skip it all together you should see it at some point but I'm telling,0.036768027
