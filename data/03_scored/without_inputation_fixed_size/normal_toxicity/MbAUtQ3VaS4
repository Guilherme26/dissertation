what's up everybody and welcome back to another movie review I'm chase Lee in the,0.05507428
movie I want to take a look at right now is the fair well now,0.057348292
this one comes from a 24 and it is written and directed by Lulu Wang,0.06827615
and this one stars Aquafina yes that Aquafina from crazy rich Asians and she stars,0.60171854
as Billie and her and her and her family live in the United States and,0.1526416
her dad gets a call from his aunt his mother's sister and she says hey,0.2866864
your mother's got stage 4 cancer she's not gonna last long just letting you know,0.76878536
and so this really kind of puts him into you know like a downward spiral,0.24164526
a little bit he's like well we gotta go we gotta go see her and,0.18805282
so you know going from the u.s. to China is not a cheap flight and,0.26585045
so they they spend a lot of money to go over there rightfully so it's,0.061474286
you know one of the family members getting sick but they what they do is,0.19335653
they staged a wedding from for Billy's cousin and they that's how they bring everyone,0.10475422
together from all over the world to go to this wedding so they could basically,0.086230576
be around her grandmother you know before she passes and just spend as much time,0.25707003
with her as possible before the day eventually comes and you know we've all been,0.09017853
there we've it's it's not it's not fun but spending as much time as you,0.12259079
can with loved one before they go he's very important and that's what they do,0.078125104
here they just do it in a very funny way and so you know going,0.068223126
into this I heard a lot about this movie from Sundance this is where I,0.0798852
heard the most pop from and I I was like oh wow with the farewell,0.081661716
aquafina drama well what is this I have to see this pronto so you know,0.18472232
from Sundance until now which is like seven months you know I've been hearing nothing,0.09086207
but great things and I solved the trailer to it and I was like this,0.060725532
looks like a really great movie like just a a solid straightforward good movie so,0.08835476
I walked out of the movie and I hate a 24 because every time when,0.18335445
I see a good movie I have to reorganize my top 10 list yet again,0.06374513
it gets a little annoying you know for first firstworldproblems indeed do not feel sorry,0.30662143
for me no this is a wonderful film it is absolutely touching it's heartbreaking it's,0.14916997
funny poignant it's just it's a really well-balanced movie and it's it's so straightforward so,0.06322254
simple its bare-bones type of filmmaking but it resonates with not only like me but,0.15244614
I think it'll resonate with like everyone else that watches this movie it's it's just,0.081042185
it's a wholesome movie that everyone can go and join everyone can appreciate with that,0.0733082
being said it is a 24 first-ever pg-rated film I know kind of weird right,0.10467012
if you saw midsummer like that's borderline nc-17 is just really funny to go from,0.117725834
that one to this one and this one is a film that while everyone can,0.08132261
enjoy it which is fantastic I love movies like that that was just pure crowd-pleasers,0.13619694
that um everyone can kind of a kind of grasp onto it and so what,0.15055145
I really appreciated about Lulu Wang's kind of writing and directing is that she doesn't,0.11598354
have to make a flashy movie she doesn't have to make something and hold our,0.188508
attention for every three seconds with like an explosion or like a fast cut or,0.15119325
anything absurd like that it is such a straightforward story and it's really just down,0.19154435
to its simplicity that makes it so beautiful you have a film that opens up,0.08262358
with Billie and her parents they hear about the news and then they're Amelie in,0.15182741
China and from that point on all we do is just see the interactions between,0.14582756
each family member and then the movie ends it is one of the it's probably,0.071905605
the simplest movie I've seen all year the reason why resonates so well is because,0.08750901
she knows that it's a simple story and you have to elevate it with great,0.1171028
writing and great characters to start with the writing the writing is sharp it's it's,0.05206728
on point in the the comedy work she never would think a movie about death,0.17925173
there would be as much comedy either as there is but listen there's a lot,0.095776334
of goofy families out there and I appreciate that this family has enough personality to,0.6054875
wear even in its darkest times in this movie people can still be a little,0.13630816
lighter in the next scene and just enjoy each other's company and that's where the,0.031882904
comedy comes from it feels very realistic doesn't even feel like I'm watching actors those,0.10569444
look I'm watching there's a real family go through this real struggle and Aquafina is,0.070540816
you know you know kind of sharp comedic timing does work in some scenes because,0.07656329
it once again it shows that she has personality and the whole family has personality,0.16866167
as well that they're able to kind of bounce off of her her improv and,0.35172948
her jokes and everyone else's you know might crack a joke whatever it's just it,0.24046569
felt so natural and so organic and then while it while it is you know,0.0733766
got a lot of heart and a lot of humor to it it does have,0.055231728
a lot of somberness it does have a lot of subtlety and a lot of,0.114042826
nuance in its storytelling its character development and acting with its characters this isn't a,0.055969197
movie that like feels like it was made under a Hollywood microscope where we have,0.07180644
to write every single character you know crying in hysteria because their grandmother is just,0.16691686
it's going what Lulu does fantastically and balances so well is that she she captures,0.14686768
what it is like in the final moments of someone that's about to pass everyone,0.09627346
in this movie breaks down at different moments no one breaks down at the same,0.06453223
moment and that's what I love about it at first you know Billie is like,0.085344575
kind of hesitant to go because like her grandmother's about to die but as the,0.366307
movie coming keeps going she has her moments where she breaks her cousin has his,0.16844006
moment when he breaks at the most unfortunate situation which can apply to the comedy,0.09893582
area her dad has a nice moment her uncle has a nice moment and Anton,0.1823788
cause it's just everyone has their moment to shine and they are they're all kind,0.088836476
of coping with it in there either own speed and that's where I found once,0.07543605
again very realistic about it very very grounded and just kind of honest to how,0.066701196
humans react to this stuff and just once again there's nuance to the way they,0.07357525
are written it they're the times that they kind of kind of break down or,0.14173046
unexpected I I don't really know well like how the movie is gonna kind of,0.10897853
treat these characters how they're gonna kind of weaving out their emotions and that's what,0.10011181
is kind of so beautiful about it is because everyone's human in this movie everyone,0.35754564
feels like a real human just kind of coping with this thing in different ways,0.29849285
and I really love the kind of grieving process that each of these family members,0.040786956
kind of go through and on top of all that their connection is wonderful once,0.13794778
again it feels like a real family uncles aunts cousins the parents the grandparents grandparents,0.084739275
siblings it's just like everyone was bouncing bouncing off of each other so well that,0.19149616
once again goes back to Lulu lanes direction and what I was saying with the,0.053987205
writing is that balance it's all about balance ping-pong hanging back and forth showing what,0.10347243
she excuse-me needs to show excuse me I don't know what that was showing what,0.23995179
she needs to show and doing it in such a meaningful manner nothing ever feels,0.114915185
wasted this is such an airtight movie and is well edited you know for its,0.15399842
hour-and-a-half runtime it's a short movie but short sweet into the point and that is,0.09405678
the best way to describe it going to the nuance of the acting this is,0.05686667
it's really funny when I saw last year aquafina and crazy rich Asians I was,0.58816546
like alright she's got some like Melissa McCarthy vibes she's she's an interesting supporting character,0.13605532
and she's got so much personality it's so bubbly and inviting you she's the type,0.4698859
of person that you want to go hang out with I have a drink with,0.35734776
and discuss life with she does a complete 180 in this movie and I absolutely,0.1539965
love it her her subtlety in her her emotional stakes in this movie are so,0.31710002
high she picks the right moments to explode her character with where you know she's,0.36489764
talking with her mom and she's she's had enough in what she has to yell,0.45041838
at her you know um one scene where she's talking in English to one of,0.13549249
the doctors in the hospital and her grandmother can't hear but you can tell that,0.14612573
her eyes are like tearing up because she's hearing like the the news in an,0.26037204
honest way because the doctor is keeping everything hidden from her I I didn't look,0.08585251
into it I don't know if that's a cultural thing in China where if people,0.24196018
are dying if they ever struck with an illness and they only have like a,0.25925088
few months to live or something I don't know if it is culture to keep,0.12592812
them in the dark like that and just let them die peacefully you know I'm,0.7194416
not opposed to it I think that's fantastic and it kind of keeps them less,0.078719996
paranoid and just kind of lets them go peacefully I guess yeah you know I,0.60475713
I see no issue with it but if that's a cultural thing please let me,0.076620184
know down below but um yeah it's just uh they they keep up this lie,0.2990802
you know pretty well and it just takes a lot of it takes a lot,0.088808
of toll on these these actors and these actresses and everyone is just it's so,0.18139407
somber and so kind of beautiful and poetic with their performances I really enjoyed and,0.11068013
Aquafina is fantastic everything you've heard about her and this movie is very warranted she,0.10081172
is outstanding a couple couple things and I'll go and wrap this up the second,0.06379916
thing is speaking of the cultural thing it doesn't matter if you're from China if,0.15012605
you're from Japan Taiwan any Asian territory any European territory American territory whatever everyone can,0.14878318
enjoy this you don't have to be Chinese to enjoy this film this is a,0.15619552
film about family it's about love it's about compassion it's about the grieving process it,0.06422336
is once again a human thing everyone that is a human being can enjoy this,0.13738623
movie it is a universally made movie that's what I love about it everyone can,0.06952532
watch this movie and be like I've been there I've done that so yeah I,0.11262154
mean you know I adds a grandmother that passed last year and so I kind,0.17244764
of did everything that was done in this movie like I lied to myself about,0.17196243
it I'm sure everyone else lied to themselves about it and you know when the,0.15280728
day came it hit you or maybe a hit you a day later they day,0.5547613
or two later you know it's just it's it's interesting how people people cope with,0.059481937
it and just watch this movie brought brought a lot of those memories back and,0.05852286
it's it's you know death is uh it's inevitable but it's a it's an interesting,0.4185294
process that's all I'll say and the last thing I want to say before I,0.06852636
wrap this up is that Lulu Wang while making a simplistic story did not skimp,0.15021123
on the visual aesthetic of the film the one thing I really appreciate about the,0.0661582
cinematography is not only is it clean it's you know it's clear it's it's just,0.094354324
really nice cinematography excuse me she plays with the framing a little bit if you,0.2517837
are making a movie you know typically if you have a shot like this you,0.28043023
want to have about that much Headroom between your head in the top of the,0.31248242
frame if you want to make it a shot interesting if you have them over,0.29703754
here and like the third right there or excuse me right right there like there's,0.08999696
a third there's a third and there's a third you can have their faces right,0.10175178
there you could have you know extreme close-ups and see like their face there's many,0.20175731
ways you can frame a scene and she could have easily made this visually boring,0.18166536
but what I love about it it's just it's just subtle things like this small,0.104996964
little things matter folks she has most of her her characters like this we're like,0.15675107
the top of their head is hitting the halfway point in the frame and so,0.24617457
it's mainly just like their head in like a little bit of their their chest,0.46336803
area in the bottom half of the frame and so I was thinking myself like,0.14203936
why is she doing this and I came up to the conclusion that I think,0.08104663
she did it this way because the situation that this family is going through with,0.091003865
you know the grandmother experiencing this and them experiencing the the grief and the inevitability,0.10673164
of her death is that the situation weighs on them so if the situation is,0.15940215
weighing on them it's just kind of like pushing them down a little bit and,0.33412462
like their bodies are sinking with it and that's that's how I interpret it it,0.116692394
could be something completely different she could be like I just did it cuz it,0.07081165
looked good what you does it adds a little bit of uniqueness to the film,0.073217995
but that's what I got him is that the situation is weighing on them so,0.07037749
much that's actually pushing them down in the frame once again just adding a nice,0.13687237
little extra layer to the film guys this is a wonderful film it's a it's,0.104496114
an honest film about family and about death it's a funny film it's wholeheartedly just,0.1690255
fantastic I have nothing bad to say about this movie it is a straightforward movie,0.10788529
it's airtight everything about it works for me I love the farewell quite a bit,0.105371706
I know my fiancee did too so I'm going to give the farewell an A,0.061851177
it deserves an A I have no issues with it it's gonna make the top,0.31462586
ten eventually I just need to figure out that list but thank you a 24,0.040769015
for three great ones in a row you can stop now cuz it's getting ridiculous,0.5876557
no keep coming yeah so if you've seen the farewell please comment down below and,0.11025004
let me know but until that until that let me know anything else down below,0.18691868
and that will do it for this review guys I'm chase Lee and tune in,0.062173575
