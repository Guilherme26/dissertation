premiering the song video hi i hope you enjoyed watching this with me and feel free to comment like live chat whilst watching because i'm going to be watching it with you so i'll probably respond to

to edit so please check it out if you haven't because i love descendants too so um yeah anyway let's get into this video this is all about inside out i'm not going to waste more of your time let's go [Music] wow i love the animation that looks really cool that looks really cool like little fuzz balls i don't know what the texture is it's interesting and there she was oh that's so sweet that's the cutest thing wow okay that looks so cool and i'm also loving the score it's like so emotional and sweet i mean of course this books are wow i love the animation just riley and me forever for 33 seconds i'm sadness oh hello i i'm joy so can i just if you could i love how her first two emotions were joy and sadness and like with joy come stannis i like that [Music] and that's it we love our girl and she's got great friends and a great house things couldn't be better after all riley's 11 now what could happen okay not what i had in mind how do you guys know know about this move have you not like paying attention san francisco california tell me how i just found out that san francisco is in california i feel dumb for not knowing that is that common knowledge because i did not know that here's our new house that is so small that is so disappointing of a house i would hate that let's go get our stopper in the moving van all right goodbye well guess what the moving van won't be here until thursday you're kidding everything seems to be going wrong and joy is just trying to hold on like crazy see you sweetie dad just left us oh he doesn't love us anymore that's sad i should drive right joy what are you doing uh i love this i'm only a few minutes in and i'm loving like the symbolism what the heck is that it's broccoli on pizza that's it i'm done congratulations san francisco you've ruined pizza okay i'm loving the lions and now you crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life's problems okay you know what love and sadness relatability right now oh come on it could be worse yeah joy we could be lying on the dirty floor in a bag i guess all i really want to say is thank you huh you know through all this confusion you've stayed well you've stayed our happy girl your dad's under a lot okay that is so not a good thing to tell your daughter smiling it would be a big help that is no for him right no oh that's that's upsetting me to my core yeah sure honestly guys i'm kind of relating a bit too much like i'm feeling a bit too much relating a bit too much to sadness and like after some i've gone through i just know that you cannot say that to someone because it just it's going to hurt them a lot more trying forcing themselves to be happy trying to put a smile on their face it's just it's so not good and it's so straining on that person their body and mind and i i hate that i'm actually really connected to what this movie is trying to do with joy being really pushy she honestly seems like the villain of this movie so far okay i really like that song that like gentle music it's i don't know why it's making me emotional like i'm preparing my body for what's gonna come you know i'm gonna make sure that tomorrow is another great day i promise today wasn't even a good day how can you make sure tomorrow's a good day that's my thing did you see that look they're judging us [Music] but everything's different now okay this is so sad and so hard to watch okay i don't know imagine being the king of guys that's a core memory [Music] joy is legit the villain of this movie like what the hell you're not in headquarters without you riley can't be happy honestly i feel like you're describing depression she has no identity and no hap like no way feeling happy because joy's gone her core personalities and everything is just gone that is they have to be describing like depression or something there uh-oh she's looking at us uh what did she say oh oh sorry sir no one was listening is it garbage night uh we left the toilet seat up what what is it woman what he's making that stupid face again i could strangle him right now signal him again ah so riley how was school for this we gave up that brazilian helicopter pilot well what i want to know more about that that's it go to your room now foot is down the foot is down good job gentlemen that could have been a disaster well that was a disaster oh my gosh this mom is legit like not in this relationship right now she's not here for it okay that actually hurts it's like she's losing a part of herself part for personality damn i'm relating to this way too much it's actually hurting ugh that's sad why is this movie just sad without even trying i mean it's probably trying if you want to walk the long way go for it but riley needs to be happy i'm not missing that train bing bong knows what he's doing he's part dolphin they're very smart joy's a narcissist i just realized that she's like riley needs me like i know she needs to be happy like but like you know what i mean she thinks a lot too much about herself that is my favorite oh it's so soft oh let me try hey what's the big idea you better fix that wall or else you're invincible he just murdered somebody okay i like bing bong that's wow yeah i stashed it in there for safekeeping and now i'm all set to take riley to the moon he is destroying everything like all around him i would have sworn sparkle pony mount was right here hey what's going on well yeah i i don't know princess dream world oh the stuffed animal hall of fame oh oh they're tearing down her old imaginations okay because it's old and she's growing up okay that's sad ah this whole movie is just showing about growing up and like all the changes as we can see in her mind her imagination being forgotten her memories being thrown away just a lot of things changing oh gosh why does that make me so emotional once we flew back in time we had breakfast twice that day see i love how sadness is comforting sadness is like there's a use for her we were best friends if you can't understand that pain yeah i can't connect with people no these facts and opinions look so similar ah don't worry about it happens all the time that's hilarious actually that that yeah how about we wake her up sadness that's ridiculous how could we possibly how about we wake her up great idea jordan thanks come on yeah narcissist joy is a narcissist we're gonna make her so happy she'll wake up with exhilaration we'll excite her awake and that's never that's not possible if you're happy in a dream you want to stay dreaming you just don't want to wake up like i just wanted to sleep for 10 hours like i was not tired anymore but i felt my dream made me feel happy so i stayed sleeping that is terrifying that's really all you care about your friend is being locked up this looks so cool i really like the way subconscious looks you know for a fact there's like some badass thoughts down there in the subconscious it's broccoli is black looking that terrifying i never hated this i actually usually always liked it candy wrappers why is he in a clown jail with like balloons that's hilarious oh because there's a crowd okay are kind of scary i mean i've never had an encounter with clowns i wouldn't know i mean yeah i think like some clouds are scary like i feel like people who make like some kinds of scary because they got a way to be scary but i'm i don't know i have not i've not like had a personal bad experience with the clown that you are making so much noise can you not [Music] okay that's that is concerning okay that is creepy did you say birthday this time is freaking me out i promise okay can you please stop no that's not [Music] it was a dream this is ridiculous we can't even get a good night's sleep anymore time to take action stupid mom and dad if they had moved us none of this would have happened i'm like anger's character i like that he's taking control and he's representing what would actually happen like the feelings and emotions that would you'd feel in this situation stop you're hurting riley no no no i did it again if you get in here these core memories will get sad i'm sorry riley needs to be happy joy is really pissing me off like she's really the villain here leaving sadness behind and stuff like that only focusing on herself and wanting to feel happy oh my god this is pixar did such a good analogy with this okay that has given me some avengers memories that that okay that scared me and it's like your subconscious fear oh okay okay this is making me sad wow she used to stick her tongue out when she was coloring it's feeling like someone died and it's like just her memories but it's like feeling like a part of her diary basically heard that she died and it's actually sad i don't like that three tears came now oh my eyes burned now two tears came out bedtime i hate it seeing those things fade away it just makes me sad it was the day the prairie dogs lost the big playoff thing marley missed the winning challenge [Music] this is a great thing about how happiness can only come once you like sadness after sadness and like events like or it's just like it's yin yang they both have to come together it balances out which is true all the time though if you're sad someone will come and help you but that's not it's not always the case and that sucks that really does okay gosh this is giving me way too much infinity vibes i'm not this one i'm not liking it's giving me a lot of experiments oh [Music] that's so heartbreaking take her to the moon for me okay [Music] why don't you fade away like that just so not fair that is so not it's so not okay this is shady as hell i feel worried for you just let me go riley's better off without me coming oh my god why is that why is this movie just hitting different like santa's being like let me go joey's better off without me because you know when you're like sad or like depressed you're just like you just wanted to go away you just want the sadness go away you want you want to be happy it's legit this is this is the embodiment of that we can't make riley feel anything oh that is that's terrible she is fully honestly she is fully committed to the whole she's like the deepest sad she's depressed depressed ah poor rally like feeling that at such a young age [Music] i don't think you printed enough boyfriends [Music] that's okay i love that i love the dedication design for her yep loving that and we don't support dying for something oh i wish joy was here kind of dumb but i'm just saying in this movie's house well what would you do if you're so smart i tell you but you're too dumb to understand what of course your tiny brain is confused i love i like disgust like i like her personality she seems like that sassy friend i think you're really kind of like mean i don't know like could be bullying others but like she's not really like that and she's not like a boy for you you know what i mean [Music] riley oh we were worried sick where have you been it's so late okay i'm i'm liking this so far the like ending and so i don't know i just feel like pixar's gonna come out and just hit you but but okay wow okay this is something a lot harder than i thought it would this is not okay i know you don't want me to but i miss home i miss minnesota you need me to be happy but i want my old friends and my hockey team i want to go home please don't be mad i'm so glad she's talking to her parents oh i'm glad that she's talking and they're being nice gosh why does pixar do this to us in that song we heard in the beginning that like soft instrumental oh it's going back again hey i'm liking this new view friendship island's expanded glad they finally opened that friendly argument section i like tragic vampire romance island fashion island oh everyone shut up boyband island hope that's just a phase say what you want i think it's all beautiful i love that there you go i love that expanded console is up she's um maturing and going through so more emotions expanded consoles guys what's puberty yeah oh it's probably not important sorry okay i love that i love that okay um wow tears came out of me with that one okay that was something that was something i felt and dealt with with a lot of tears um i really like inside out i really like what it teaches you and like what it tells and like for people i don't know like i i can like emotionally connect to it and pixar is just really great at doing that um i'm sorry if i wasn't like as energetic and like funny and silly as i would be during this commentary just like this movie i connect to it a little bit too much and like i didn't i honestly did not know what to say sometimes and like i didn't know what joke jokes to make or anything it was like i was just like watching absorbing and i didn't want to like talk too much like preaching this so that's why i was kind of like that um and it's like late in the afternoon it's like what it's one and so i am um i'm a little bit tired but i'm not like that tired but yeah i am um yeah i think more people show attention in inside out it's it's a really good movie and like as someone who's like been the press before that was like complete that was such a good way to represent it like forcing happiness on top of yourself like being like i need to be happy and hating sadness like hating sadness so much thinking it's so like useless and it's like why why do i feel sad just like yeah and all the anger the fear to discuss that comes with that like towards sadness and towards just everything that doesn't make you happy it's just like so it's so true and i really like that and i really like like at the end they like accept sadness and realize that sadness has like you need it in your emotions you need to feel sadness like to feel empathy like with helping bing bong like i mean my sense of empathy has grown but also because of sadness the thing the things like i took for granted before things i loved i loved even more like i loved tv before but now i love tv even more not being able to feel the happiness that it once gave me and then regaining that happiness i'm never gonna let that go and just like it just like yeah i am not the same person i was a year ago but i like this person i am now i like the videos i'm making on youtube that makes me happy like all the people i'm connecting with with you so that makes me happy i like continuing watching tv and trying and um applying for college to be director applying for college is so hard and stressful so wish me luck with that but yeah that's what i like inside out and i'm sorry this wasn't my like giddy up happy video and like you're probably not gonna like it but like i'm glad i watched it and said these things in front of the camera because at least i said it in front of people instead of just thinking it so people know how i feel whoever does watch this but i'm yeah anyway stop talking about myself that was a good movie and like anyone who's feeling sad i should probably watch that and get some a good cry out of it and just like enjoy how much you can relate to it and how much it shows that there are people out there that who understand you and understand that feeling because that is that is good to show um yeah anyway um veering away from that topic um like
