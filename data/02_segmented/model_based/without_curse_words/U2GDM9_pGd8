"Hey, everybody today, I'm going to be talking about a parasite"
"This film was co-written and directed by Bong Joon-ho He's the director that's gained a lot of momentum in terms of his international success and acclaim, I would say within the last 10 years or so, he's a nod to her"
That's quite appreciated in the Us
and Paris
That really is my first exposure to this director
I went in knowing almost nothing about the movie and I think that that is the best way to experience it if you haven't seen the film
I actually recommend that you stop watching this review
"Go watch it and then come back and see what I have to say, because I just think that you're gonna get a lot more out of it"
I think the strength of this film is how it surprises you when it surprises you
It's never really jarring in the traditional sense
"You know, it's not kind of jolting you back and forth your emotions"
"Everything feels very seamless and in terms of the transitions it feels like it's more kind of sliding and curving its way around this plot, rather than taking really kind of angular corners"
"It's very meticulous, very controlled"
"You never know where it's gonna go tonally or in terms of the plot, And that is quite refreshing"
I often talk about movies like this
It's a common theme in the movies that we see
It's where you know
"we're talking about a director who is making a movie that is pulling from all of these very distinct, very different genres from the past, and sort of passing them together where you as an audience member, and certainly the director feels very aware of the influences where the story itself becomes more"
"I mean, as I said conscious, it's It's more about how the culture has shaped the point of view of this writer of this director, this particular story, and while this does have a lot of that in it, it's not that kind of movie"
"At the same time, this is a film that wants to swerve in and out of these different lanes"
"These these each Lane being a different genre, but it's doing it in a way that is very stealthy and it's almost almost invisible"
"At times, the film is dabbling in all kinds of things"
"At first, It seems to be more kind of like a, like a black comedy satire"
"It has a lot of slapstick comedy, but then it starts to beer more into the horror thriller genre, but ultimately it is a movie that is about"
"It's a social commentary on class struggle, but all of this is a homogenous blend that seems to have all the flavors of all of these ideas"
"But it's all at once and it's all one concoction, and there's not a moment where you don't feel that the film is completely in control of every every beat, every little thing that it is saying"
"every hair is perfectly in place, And there was just one moment"
I can't even give you the context For the moment
I don't remember where it happened
I just remember seeing this image
"It was very quick, but you could see kind of an image of Alfred Hitchcock and I think some other people that might have influenced him, And that's like the one time where it really feels conscious as if to say yes, I am pulling from all of these different influencers these different tours and their genres, but it is so brief it it's so quick You miss it, and of course I'm going to pay attention to that, especially being who I am"
"I'm gonna notice all of the different ways that the story is being constructed, but overall I found it to be much more palatable for me, and, and something more interesting because the effect of it was so subtle and so sophisticated"
"It's a very slow boil in terms of how it escalates to the climax, and I think having all of that beneath the service, having all of these these genres and the ideas behind it be almost invisible"
It really makes the film more layered
"It gives it a lot more complexity, more dimension because it allows us to explore everything so much more keenly"
You know we're exploring
"We're aware of all of these different facets in terms of the emotions on the human spectrum, and we're seeing it through all of these genres which they sort of define the world"
"They define what the world is about, in all kinds of different ways, all kinds of different points of view, and it's exploring what life is about and how we experience it"
When the film began
"I saw this, of course, more as slapstick comedy, because there's a lot more humor in it than I was expecting and it is"
"Yeah, so it's like it's like a black comedy about class struggle and how it is shifted in the modern age is very satirical"
Talking about even in just the first scene how they're just living for that that Wi-Fi signal that they're trying to get from other neighbors Because they don't
They don't have any where you know
The idea of pressing send on a text message that could be really bad for you Is it seems like to these people it's almost like a clear bomb going off
It's almost the same thing
Pressing sin can change your whole life
"How the DIY culture is changing everything, breaking the walls down on how things can be done and who does things? I mean, we have the ability now to be able to be able to take different jobs just by googling how to do them, and are watching Youtube videos on how to do things, And that changes everything, because you don't have to have a formal education or anything like that, but pretty early on I'd say, especially when they start going to the actual house where the film really takes place, you start to get watts of the of those thriller and horror vibes, but that all comes to fruition more in the third act, where everything shifts into a more off-kilter more eccentric idea of what horror is, as well as the comedy where the brutality it becomes the focus"
It's the poor working secretly underground and they are literally below the upper class
What the movie seems to be saying is that you always have to break a few eggs to make an omelet
"In this sort of society, one person's gain is always going to be another person's loss"
"Unfortunately, this movie did remind me of Jordan peels us a lot"
"That's of course, a movie that came out in the United States and it was earlier this year, but there are so many similarities because then it is also a film that is a commentary on on socio politics, and it is also filtered through this genre-bending lens"
"that is, it's kind of part pastiche"
It's part comedy
It's part horror
It is part satire as well
"That's a movie that I did not get around to reviewing, but I did like it quite a bit"
"However, I have to say that this film it takes it a lot further"
It takes a lot of these ideas much further
And it's it's more focused
"It's more cohesive morally as well as as plot wise, and it's just more skillfully or skillful in terms of how it's able to manipulate the audience into feeling all of these things"
All of these emotions that shift all over the spectrum
He'll has a great quote that I love to recite a lot because I think it's a great philosophy for him
But you know he was talking about his career change
"People couldn't believe that he went to, you know, from like sketch comedy to all of these these auteur horror films, But he said he doesn't think that it's really that that jarring of a difference"
He does not think that comedy is really that different from horror
"The the line between them is actually very thin, and I think that parasite also embodies that idea, and I think that somebody like Jordan Peele would really appreciate something like Parasite"
It's the idea of how sometimes life and its ideas are just too complex to be contained within one genre
"Life, even when it is very tragic, is also at the same time full of a lot of awkward things and funny things"
It's all kinds of different genres that constantly run into one another
"I actually think that this movie Parasite could more so be compared to a movie like Takashi Amie Case, The audition, or I should say, audition"
I'm sorry
"I always say the Um, which I feel like"
"If you haven't seen that movie and you are interested, don't watch any more of this review because I feel like I've already given you too much information"
"Or just with that that sentence, Don't even look at the cover of the movie"
"You know if you can get somebody to press play for you before you watch it, Because the less you know, the better It is very similar to this film and it is also one of my favorite movies of all time"
"But for those of you who have seen it, I'm sure you, you know what I mean"
"How it subtly builds from something that's very quiet, contemplative, very sweet and romantic, and almost like"
it's a like an a zoo film
And then it just twists and twists and twist into this so realistic horror piece
And for me that that is one of the crowning achievements of being able to do that sort of thing
But I admire that film and I admire Parasite as well
"I would say, though that something like audition is more elevated, More sophisticated For me, There were a few times in Parasite where I thought that there were some kind of iffy lines"
"but when I say all of that, I am very much nitpicking"
"Another reason, I think that the movie does have that emotional weight because it is a very tragic film is because all of the characters are so nuanced and so dimensional"
"You don't see the upper-class characters as villains necessarily, and you don't see the poor culprits as the villains"
either
"of course, the Kim family is the one that we follow them where we're going on their journey from beginning to end, but we do also root for the the upper-class family, and I think part of that is is the performance by the actress who plays the the rich mother"
"I I liked a lot of the performances in this movie, but hers, in particular, I really liked with a character like her"
"She does need to be that that that emotional center she requires the ability to embody that innocence, and that that gullibility, and just that that natural comedic ignorance that that rich people tend to have, there is something kind of endearing about it and you're sort of drawn to it because she's just just like anybody else"
"She's just living her life and she's doing what she believes is best for her family, and in the same way the Kim family is doing what is best for them"
"Of course, the stakes are much higher for them, but but it's the same sort of thing"
"but by the time you get to the third act of the movie, I think each of the main players could be seen at some points as very sympathetic, and at other times as as villains"
"How the plot develops and how those character motivations develop is to me the overall strength, and what I said does give it that emotional art, because as I said, this is a technical achievement, but also one that really does resonate with you emotionally"
"and I think overall, this movie is a total knockout"
"I think I advise everyone to see it if you can, because it is"
"It's worth every minute of your time, and that's my review"
