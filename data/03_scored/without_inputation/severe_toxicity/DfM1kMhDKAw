hearing a lot about Dunkirk around the office and most of my colleagues keep focusing,0.04380567
on the structure of the story the limited dialogue and the large ensemble of characters,0.015062419
so normally I do like to walk into a movie with a completely open mind,0.07666973
or at least as open as humanly possible but in this case one of the,0.023575438
big questions I wanted to answer for myself at least was is this the best,0.028797131
way to tell this story now I think I'm leaning towards a no on that,0.028251015
right now but that doesn't mean I didn't like it in fact I really do,0.012079735
admire Christopher Nolan's approach and I think it served the movie well in some respects,0.033467386
but before I get too deep into my review a very brief synopsis for you,0.07314958
the movie is based on the real Dunkirk evacuation during world war ii and it's,0.064480245
divided into three parts so the mole is about a young soldier trying to get,0.04773092
off the beach the sea follows a civilian boat going to rescue stranded soldiers and,0.0239067
then third one is the air which features tom hardy as a fighter pilot first,0.011272202
off the obvious here on the technical front Dunkirk is fantastic the visuals are stunning,0.05692575
what it took to block all those extras is truly mind-blowing the sound design is,0.0588468
incredible and the way Hans Zimmer score is woven in is also something else there,0.01707859
are moments when it pairs perfectly with the gunfire or jet engines and then all,0.022779213
of a sudden it'll be in stark contrast to all that and there are a,0.017651979
number of moments when both approaches drastically enhanced certain beats of the story performances are,0.013444027
also spot-on throughout you believe every single person every single second beyond Whitehead does a,0.03328047
lot with very little dialogue as the main soldier featured in that first part the,0.022811143
mole and Harry Styles proves he's actually a totally capable actually a really talented actor,0.090619296
in that portion too Hardy is excellent in the air and so is Jack Loudoun,0.03206518
who plays another pilot in that part and then with a seat three leaves really,0.015089691
bring a lot to their characters you've got Mark Rylance our strong sense of common,0.03549952
determination to him berry Kyojin is George a really young kid just trying to lend,0.036313705
a hand and then tonglen Carney as Rylands his son who fits in right in,0.0721405
the middle of the two of them and he really brings the group together especially,0.030599114
when they start to navigate the situation with Killian burpies character really breaking it all,0.2968375
down now maybe I should give the movie even more credit than I was planning,0.03588067
to because every single segment is pretty moving and memorable and the ways they come,0.017424485
together aren't really in a haha see what I did there kind of way the,0.03247493
fact that they all connect actually feels organic and the way they come together also,0.012543368
winds up enhancing the atmosphere no one visuals very clearly show you how dangerous the,0.033735454
situation is then you got the score and sound design which make it even more,0.011835612
intense but that nonlinear narrative format actually further highlights the chaos Dunkirk is missing the,0.030039027
emotional beat of a traditional war film but in exchange for overwhelming atmosphere there's a,0.050344422
real chaos to the movie that makes the evacuation truly truly frightening this isn't a,0.027831284
scenario where the hero can save the day and then sail off into the sunset,0.076450884
someone's survival is just a total crapshoot you could see it in one of the,0.29979333
very first scenes when the beach is being bombed we're focused on one soldier on,0.033568494
the ground and we see the bombs dropping all around him so it's one two,0.18335521
three and then it stops right before he gets to him and it's so intense,0.055210907
I'm giving Dunkirk four out of five duties on the Dewey Decimal scale you may,0.076005876
not catch every single name or understand every single line of dialogue but Dunkirk will,0.016751984
make sure that you remember how treacherous this incident was while also highlighting the difference,0.063856296
just a little selflessness can make and that combination is pretty damn powerful so that's,0.14182779
