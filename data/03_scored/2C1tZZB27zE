hello everybody I am Tiffany here with Bella and flareon once again to bring you,0.11542313
another movie review I'm super excited for this it is award season time guys the,0.10609868
Oscars are coming up soon the SAG Awards the Golden Globes have already happened a,0.07209861
bunch of nominated movies are out right now that I really have wanted to see,0.108576894
so just warning you you are going to get a lot of nominated movies these,0.24797302
next couple of weeks because well that's what I've been watching so I can keep,0.05885268
up and all my nominated movies the movie I am reviewing today is one of,0.05716804
those nominated movies and the movie I am talking about is Luther needy bird it,0.1310557
has an amazing cast it has Saoirse Ronan who was in Brooklyn and she's been,0.14249443
around for a while like ever since she was a little kid she was in,0.26229575
Atonement did you know that she was briney in atonement he's also Laurie Metcalf in,0.15473989
this movie Lucas hedges who was in three billboards as well and Manchester by the,0.16295956
sea he is just killing it right now so good for you Lucas hedges it's,0.8564192
also directed by credit Gerwig I'm sorry if I pronounced any of those names wrong,0.1114056
it overall just has an amazing cast and amazing team behind it and I believe,0.058849048
chronically directed wrote it produced it she did everything basically so good for you Greta,0.09231702
Gerwig you are amazing I was super excited to see it everybody's been raving about,0.39661247
this kind of calling it the new Mean Girls a little bit too with watching,0.47197628
you now I can see that aspect to it I over all really enjoyed it,0.15865017
it definitely isn't my favorite movie of the nominated movies but it's still super good,0.074951254
and definitely deserves to be nominated it's a really fast paced movie it's only an,0.087185316
hour and 34 minutes people that is pretty short so if you're not looking for,0.24091259
a movie that is time consuming or the epic length of Titanic or Lord of,0.11758022
the Rings then this is the movie for you because it's the complete opposite of,0.15551385
that it definitely is a mixture of drama and comedy it is on the lighter,0.11018875
side in my opinion it has its very serious moments but there weren't any moments,0.098801516
in it for me that made me cry insanely or just burst out into tears,0.37155506
and meet issues or anything like that overall it's still really good and it definitely,0.13456067
does give you the feels it just doesn't bring you to Fault in Our Stars,0.08423141
level you get me as you can see I'm wearing pink because well her hair,0.15186964
is pink in here and I think her cast is pink so I figured pink,0.11656807
would work pretty well for this movie review for those of you who want statistics,0.25488335
this has an eight points zero on IMDB that is mind-blowing amazingness alright that means,0.1578022
it deserves to be nominated and it does it deserves this rating it's super duper,0.19352879
duper duper super duper good for those of you who want a synopsis and have,0.21037608
no idea what Lady Bird is about it follows this girl named Christine who nicknames,0.23973317
herself Lady Bird as she travels through her senior year of high school and is,0.15707561
about to go off to college and it's a coming-of-age story has a little bit,0.15251152
of Mean Girls esque feel at one point in time and overall it's about her,0.4031997
growing up and becoming an adult and experiencing stuff in life that she has an,0.16358435
experience before in her past I definitely believe this movie appeals to the young adult,0.1396545
crowd people that are 17 18 19 my age just because it is that coming-of-age,0.27065638
story and it is going through that senior year of high school and just being,0.032690004
19 years old right now and watching this movie I definitely related a lot to,0.048489623
it and empathize with her law on certain things just because she goes through some,0.12008825
typical high school stuff she goes through different changes she deals with her family dynamic,0.11222712
again and it's that moment in time where you're about to move on to your,0.082239084
life and become an adult and go off to college and live your life I,0.3725559
just really appreciated it especially at my age right now and I definitely want to,0.042472478
watch it when it wait older and to see a different perspective that I get,0.068594836
on it I definitely recommend this movie for people to watch I think it's really,0.12724647
really great and I think oh absolutely enjoy it so sure Ronan did an amazing,0.14985076
job and if you watched the Golden Globes I believe she won the Golden Globe,0.06126644
for Best Actress Laurie Metcalf got nominated I think that'd be the only thing that,0.061137203
I had an issue with this sometimes it seems with a little bit too fast,0.16505732
and there were moments in grey that I wish they had just kind of stopped,0.1438905
and let's sit there for a little bit for the audience but other than that,0.06904106
it's overall really really great movie that's really all I can tell you without spoiling,0.31089434
you so I suggest you go now non spoilery people go watch this movie and,0.41587612
then come back and we can talk about all the feels together alright good blue,0.072678864
get it bird lady bird overall like I said I really did enjoy this movie,0.18652064
Saoirse Ronan I felt like did an absolutely great job her character was just super,0.11129728
fun interesting seeing the dynamic of her going to a Catholic school and also growing,0.06721466
up and being a senior and dealing with the very strict environment the relationship between,0.04994175
her and her mom was absolutely interesting and I think Laura madcap did an absolutely,0.45550674
amazing job because while she was tough and strict on her daughter and it irritated,0.24105568
me I felt ladybirds irritation you also felt the love from her and you do,0.18792965
get in a way she's trying to push Lady Bird to be her best self,0.18798165
but she doesn't always do it in the best way you don't have to be,0.16296464
that hard on your daughter she's doing the best she can and probably your attitude,0.4013702
is what's causing her to rebell even more I do like that Lady Bird even,0.2802056
acknowledges in it that her mom does love her and cares a lot it was,0.48497364
just a very interesting dynamic because you can see Lady Bert's irritation with her mom,0.36479798
but then you also get that Lady Bird understands her mother's love and I thought,0.16980293
that was really cool that it wasn't just this contentious relationship I both understand each,0.055190142
other and they have their really sweet moments one of the best moments between them,0.07462275
is when Lady Bird is very hurt by her boyfriend Kyle because kayo lied and,0.31089434
said he was a virgin when he wasn't and I mom picks her up and,0.52598643
Lady Bird gets in the car and she's crying her eyes out and you're feeling,0.30552518
for her and her mom just hugs her and goes do you want to go,0.28376818
to our favorite thing and Lady Bird says yes and then they just go to,0.0676605
different houses and look at different designs that was just a really sweet moment and,0.025987796
it gives you insight into their relationship without you having to go through the whole,0.15060614
backstory of her from being a kid to now I love ladybirds dad he was,0.31089434
super kind super caring and you could see all the effort he put in he,0.030814826
was definitely a character who wasn't in it as much as I thought he was,0.09217441
going to be but he still made a really good impact which I really really,0.07423203
loved baby birds dating life though I just felt bad for her she falls in,0.31089434
love with Danny first and first of all Danny I'm gonna kill you it's just,0.90567
wrong to do to a girl I get it you're trying to hide it and,0.36541852
I felt bad because he in a school where that is really not allowed so,0.240976
I understand hiding it but the fact is that he didn't let ladybird know and,0.077840224
she believes that he was truly in love with her and he wasn't he was,0.18769774
just using her and he felt bad for him because you can see he's a,0.24023937
genuinely good guy I just was like why would you just not tell her I,0.120223865
mean I understand in one way but you don't need to lead her on like,0.14891031
that you can say hey I don't really think we should date that's what you,0.16107191
can do you don't have to explain why if you really don't want to I,0.13760804
did feel really bad for him and again there was the sweet moment where he,0.1051678
does visit her and he's freaking out because she saw him kissing another guy and,0.5579684
he's saying please don't tell and she just hugs him and goes I'm not gonna,0.16652006
tell and he breaks down in her arms so that was really sweet and that,0.23783384
was one thing about Danny is he did mess up really bad but you can,0.18265586
see he genuinely I think cares about ladybird as a friend more so and he,0.31089434
was just scared he didn't handle it right no he overall was just scared and,0.11205034
was looking for a way to make sure it wasn't really ever found out Kyle,0.0688217
on the other hand I did not like as soon as he was saying to,0.14046963
ladybird oh yeah I haven't done it with anybody either I just went liar you're,0.7039967
a liar it was very obvious I'm sorry that there's no way he hadn't been,0.5154597
with somebody like that before oh it sucks it sucks because at that moment it's,0.83881795
just taken away from you because you think you're sharing this moment with someone and,0.18245535
then he's saying oh yeah I've done it before heaven he's denying that he ever,0.0874196
said that he hadn't done it before and I just wanted to rewind the movie,0.07595464
somehow and play it back for Kyle and say there you said it right there,0.06288863
right there right there right there I loved ladybirds best friend Julie she was super,0.14586633
super sweet and kind and she reminds me a couple of my other friends too,0.11294815
I just loved her she was probably my favorite character actually just because she was,0.08614698
so genuinely kind and sweet and you could tell she meant well I mean Lady,0.196565
Bird made her rubella a little bit but overall she was a goody girl of,0.34067756
this whole entire movie I did have issue in a part of the movie where,0.089558505
it goes mean girl just because I felt like that flip was insanely fast and,0.4033955
that sometimes happens throughout the yes that seems didn't linger long enough for to have,0.04204513
the super emotional impact that it did and I just felt like that transition from,0.05220517
Lady Bird abandoning Julie and going to Jannah was just SuperDuper quick because all you,0.16727504
see is her have one conversation with Kyle then all of a sudden she's talking,0.135073
to Jenna and completely ignoring Julie I felt like there should have maybe been one,0.1517711
more scene or so I kind of connected it a little bit more because while,0.11280998
you get the sense that Kyle is popular they don't really connect him to Jenna,0.09812515
completely I mean you understand that once she starts talking to Jenna but still it,0.11587694
wasn't like he said he was best friends with Jenna or anything before unless he,0.13711073
maybe said it in the scene when they talked that they did I'm sorry I,0.052962583
don't remember that though I feel like they should have had one more scene where,0.053048845
maybe she sees Kyle hanging out with Jenna or something and then lady 4 decides,0.27407828
oh you know I'm gonna get it with Jenna so I can go see Kyle,0.09716412
I just see how quickly she turned away from Julie that was frustrating but also,0.103116095
again I felt like that happened too quickly because again if you're going for that,0.0800135
Mean Girls vibe you don't completely go against your friend like that automatically all of,0.4928736
a sudden she's needs truly one time then they're not talking anymore and I'm thinking,0.33538884
why why because Julie's amazing you need to go for Julie over Julie right right,0.08586429
Donna Lauria and go for Julie you knew it wasn't gonna work out with Jenna,0.051381364
Jenna was just annoying she was the most annoying character actually she ties with Kyle,0.5195402
her and Kyle we're just look look what you can tell you not a good,0.26110044
friend where she finally realizes where Lady Bird lives a good friend would have said,0.09050407
I don't like that you lied to me but you don't need to be ashamed,0.31089434
of where you live instead Jenna just goes I don't like this honesty we're totally,0.28279072
never ends I think I hit that right on the mark what do you guys,0.34313196
think after that her and Jenna just kind of fall off the map which I,0.439317
was quite happy about because I don't like Jenna and my other favorite moments is,0.06627855
when she does go get Julie and brings her to prom it was funny because,0.1715835
the ones we got to looking at them dancing thinking were you guys doing but,0.08628131
in the end it ended up being just this really sweet moment and going to,0.05601766
prom with your best friend is the best thing ever I'm just saying you don't,0.10627188
need a date to go to prom you can go with your best friend overall,0.104523644
though felt like it was a great movie but again I did have a little,0.077644624
bit of trouble with the quick editing just because it left some of the characters,0.12627606
a little bit underdeveloped I felt like for example Miguel and his girlfriend Shelley Shelley,0.42888203
seemed like a really interesting character and you have one moment with her and Lady,0.18119435
Bird when they're smoking and she's talking about ladybirds mom and how she really admires,0.31089434
her and that's really the only time you completely get to know Shelley and Miguel,0.092162564
you get to kind of know here and there but not fully and again his,0.14799608
moment is really when he's about to go get the job that his dad actually,0.07911723
interviewed for as well overall those were just two characters I felt like since everything,0.119462796
moved so fast you really didn't get to sit with them and understand them a,0.10348282
little bit more the only thing I really actually didn't like sadly was the ending,0.10161851
there's a super fast paced movie yeah the tragic moment where the mom doesn't get,0.1003885
out of the car to say goodbye to her daughter who's flying to New York,0.17963529
what the heck and she runs out of the car and tries to say goodbye,0.53490317
but misses her and she's breaking down in the father's arms and you feel for,0.118521616
her but then I'm saying it's your fault because you didn't get out of the,0.21068735
car the first time and you've been a jerk to her about this even though,0.8060606
she got it even though you thought she wasn't gonna get in so she proved,0.24203798
you wrong in that you should just own up to it and eventually just prohibit,0.2551568
her but what it does is cut you her in New York and basically what,0.18588732
it shows us her goes to this party get drunk make out the dude throw,0.36230853
up the dude brings her to the hospital and then she gets out of the,0.17566055
hospital find her way back to church even though after going to the Catholic school,0.24769062
it seemed like she really wanted to stay away from religion and then she calls,0.2686512
her mom and leaves a message and says I love you and it was a,0.24176814
very sweet moment do not get me wrong I loved that she said I love,0.19619693
you to her mom I think that is a great way to end it but,0.5154597
it didn't feel complete after that I was waiting for more the movie to show,0.058996215
her being successful in college or that her mom listened to the voice message you,0.15340108
see her mom's reaction to it I was waiting for something and then all of,0.40328264
a sudden she says I love you and then the screen goes black and the,0.08069068
credits start rolling and I was sitting there going that's it so I don't really,0.057717606
know how to feel about the ending I feel like I wanted to happen was,0.0664336
seeing her really thrive for being College and show that she's alright when her mom,0.28100228
really didn't think she was going to be I guess then had this moment where,0.061864473
she really does miss her and get through that call or just something maybe if,0.08925555
they had added a scene at the end where they showed the mom reacting to,0.07761114
the voicemail and you know the mom got the voicemail maybe I would have felt,0.23421258
more complete about it all I'm not sure there's just something missing at the end,0.06619012
for me and maybe you disagree with me and think it was the most perfect,0.15103172
ending ever and I feel like it could have been a perfect ending I do,0.24264061
like how she said I love you to her mom at the end but there,0.24097799
was just something else needed I felt like and I'm not sure what it is,0.05270388
and it's killing me and I don't know what it is and maybe everybody else,0.5510107
thinks it's a perfect ending and I'm just crazy what do you guys think of,0.30775043
the ending for those of you who have seen it do you agree with me,0.19406414
do you think it was a little bit short or do you think that it,0.086748034
was a great ending overall that is really all I have to say about this,0.10749699
movie though I thought it was overall pretty good there were little problems here and,0.14277002
there but I just absolutely enjoyed it still overall thank you so much for joining,0.106176995
