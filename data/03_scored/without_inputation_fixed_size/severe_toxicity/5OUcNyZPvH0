of course the two fall in love and throughout the course of the movie we,0.036698848
see her star on the rise while his star is on the demise and we,0.15876736
see how their relationship is affected by the fact that these two people are at,0.016054872
different points in their careers and also by the fact that Bradley Cooper's character is,0.008868894
dealing with a very serious addiction to drugs and alcohol it's also important to note,0.03184367
too that the stars board is actually a remake of a star is born this,0.013148685

Mason and the third iteration of a stars born came out in 1976 starring of,0.023339964
course Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson as an all movie reviews on this channel I'm,0.072938055
going to be talking about the pros and then the cons and then I'm going,0.099423006
to be giving my overall rating so let's just get into this also before I,0.077664845
begin I just want to put it up right now this is a movie review,0.045789246
filled with spoilers so if you haven't watched the movie yet maybe put this video,0.17917453
on pause so my first part of this movie is that it was beautifully and,0.041900583
intimately directed and shot by utilizing a lot of close-up shots and also this handheld,0.24860197
shakiness the movie felt as if you were watching a concert documentary it felt so,0.047718946
intimate and raw and as if you were experiencing everything with these characters from the,0.020518254
moment that Bradley Cooper's character like rushes into the car and we see the flashing,0.048047546
lights of the paparazzi shining through the window - Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's characters,0.020963928
performing in the desert it just felt like we were experiencing all of this with,0.06508822
them and the shots of the desert were so beautiful job well done - cinematographer,0.17518543
of this movie his name is Matthew Allah batik I personally hate the desert so,0.31939587
the fact that after watching this movie I was like dang I want to like,0.05071094
get on the back of the motorcycle or just go ah just kidding but the,0.064808846
fact that he was able to make the desert just look like this fantasy sweeping,0.09994251
place and additionally I just thought that Bradley Cooper as director was able to get,0.020836879
really great performances obviously out of himself but also out of Lady Gaga so kudos,0.08889714
to Bradley Cooper because this was his directorial debut alright so my second part of,0.03035499
this movie are the performances and I usually just like lump all of this together,0.040414564
but I feel like Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper each deserve their own talking points,0.07320346
so my second part of this movie is Lady gaga in this movie I just,0.12172595
felt you did such a great job and granted some people are gonna say well,0.064118385
it's not such a far reach for a singer to portray a singer but here's,0.027752127
the thing in the first hour of this movie Lady Gaga is playing this person,0.1107411
named Ali and Ali is someone who isn't famous in that first hour when she's,0.030680265
trying to make sense of Jack's world I just thought she was doing such a,0.035013936
great job because in real life she is the Bradley Cooper character I just found,0.031241015
it fascinating for her to be playing someone on the other side of it all,0.049264167
and she did such a believable job in doing that one of my favorite scenes,0.06506028
in this movie and it was actually the scene that really like moved to me,0.04198373
to the point where I was crying and I usually don't cry at scenes like,0.036656275
this but it was when Allie went on stage with Jack for the first time,0.030482706
and she is singing her song and she's kind of like oh my god I,0.034950078
can't believe this is happening to me and she does this thing where she buries,0.05123577
her face in her hands because she's just so overwhelmed by what is happening to,0.08238366
her and I found that so moving there's something about watching a person realizing their,0.02687076
dreams and real time and the overwhelmingness of that emotion and situation just really overpowering,0.014896123
that person and the way that Lady gaga acted in that scene was just so,0.14466147
sincere and genuine and you know of course because we're ready talking about Lady Gaga,0.027853236
I have to give kudos to her singing in this entire movie a lot of,0.081560165
these songs are very emotional and you could really hear the raw emotion in the,0.018855961
way that she was singing the song so yeah I just thought Lady Gaga did,0.053195402
a great job in this movie all right my third part of this movie is,0.039519224
Bradley Cooper oh my god whoo Bradley Cooper wow wow wow wow his character Jack,0.02707497
he's so likeable and endearing and from what I've heard about the other past iterations,0.07137953
of a stars born apparently that character isn't really likable or endearing and he comes,0.018625807
off as a bit of an ass but in this movie that character Jack he's,0.58258545
someone that over the course of the movie you really grow to care for and,0.039306365
have great empathy for and compassion for the fact that he is such a likeable,0.15147495
and endearing character is kind of what makes what happens to him at the end,0.029349232
of the movie really really depressing and what I loved about the way Bradley Cooper,0.072857566
portrayed Jack is you can really the progression of the addiction and how it really,0.019765932
begins to take its toll on Jack in the scenes when Jack is just drunk,0.09928997
off his mind and when Jack is actually like cognizant and present the give away,0.088601135
in his state of being was always by his eyes and additionally the moment when,0.038447615
Jack makes a decision of ok I'm going to commit suicide you can see a,0.6331723
switch go off mentally in his character and again it's all seen through here in,0.10275757
his eyes and for me personally I interpreted that moment to be when Ali's manager,0.048744656
goes to talk to Jack and then jack is laying down in bed with Ali,0.32360137
you actually don't really even see Ali for a good portion of the scene when,0.026943263
they're lying in bed it's all a close-up on Jack's face and on his eyes,0.26660758
so yeah Bradley Cooper use those eyes all right my fourth Pro to this movie,0.07123318
was the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady gaga oh my god Wow you really,0.07203939
fall in love with these two characters as a couple and the fact that you,0.07215912
really get to see these two characters me and fall in love is just very,0.027577184
like Oh moving and it has you in your feelings especially in that first half,0.02959535
of the movie you can really see that there is such a genuine care and,0.030717516
affection that these two characters have for one another which is what makes the second,0.011918095
hour of this movie so devastating to watch because in the first hour it's Jack,0.078196995
and Ali in their own desert world playing the music traveling from show to show,0.032045886
just loving and being with one another and then the second hour of the movie,0.022617575
once Ali's star begins to rise and her own career starts to take off and,0.02780002
Jack's addiction just keeps getting worse and worse and worse you see how a lot,0.08687697
of things start to tear these two people apart and they don't really get to,0.11848318
share as many intimate moments as they did in the first hour of the movie,0.02212534
but despite all of that in the moments when they do get to be together,0.027020425
and one another there is such a great intimacy and bond that these two characters,0.0630807
share my favorite parts about watching this couples love story in the movie was like,0.028914867
the details the way that Jack looks at Ali and how he is so enamored,0.031829704
with the shape of her note was in the scene when they are riding on,0.04070392
the motorcycle together and he's like touching her boob you're just like oh my god,0.6271416
all right my fifth pro to this movie is the portrayal of what it looks,0.030735476
like to be in a relationship with an addict I personally think that in a,0.08560847
lot of movies and television shows this kind of story tends to be romanticized but,0.013712096
in this particular movie it just showed how painful it is for the people involved,0.05339296
in that relationship the most prominent scene that showed how difficult it is to be,0.012445586
in a relationship with an addict was the whole Grammy sequence when Ally is just,0.029484265
trying so hard to keep some level of dignity for her and her husband and,0.054849047
she is thanking her husband while Jack is just wandering around the stage and then,0.10924444
when he pees himself and Ally covers him with her dress it's just so oh,0.21387118
my god that scene was so hard to watch it was so heartbreaking I think,0.09460109
it also just goes to show how much Ally as a person loves her husband,0.03809706
her character easily could have been angry at Jack right then and there like thrown,0.06732324
him under the bus and left him but she was someone who was still trying,0.04251122
to cover him up like literally cover him up during that scene a couple scenes,0.049322035
later when Jack is apologizing for Ally about what happened at the Grammys like that,0.03279222
is so hard to watch because there's such a level of vulnerability and raw honesty,0.039720777
that has to take place in those types of scenes so I felt like that,0.05239585
was a really great moment in the story as well you really see Jack battling,0.01925108
with the ups and downs that come with addiction and there are some days where,0.02176481
he is fine and there's other days where he really really relies heavily on the,0.024502704
alcohol or the drugs to keep him going alright my sixth part of this movie,0.033970263
is the way that they handled Jack's suicide it's really interesting too because when Jack's,0.35655352
character is introduced to us and he's in the car there's a moment where he,0.013887704
looks out the window and up in a billboard and then he kind of looks,0.047118284
back and in the background you see like this poster I think it might have,0.04413693
been from some sort of Trevor campaign like it gets better sort of thing but,0.015530042
it was like a rainbow poster and there were multiple nooses on the poster and,0.02009054
I thought that was an interesting way of foreshadowing what Jack was eventually going to,0.018638445
do at the end of the movie I felt like the way that they handled,0.047808077
Jack's suicide was handled in a very sensitive manner which I appreciate it I liked,0.5487303
that we didn't see how in fact he did it just the way that they,0.023158368
showed Jack getting things taken care of for the final time making sure that the,0.02510004
dog had food putting his cowboy hat down for the final time and I just,0.09468557
thought that was such a really great subtle way of showing what was going to,0.018627137
happen because we've seen his character in a cowboy hat for like a majority of,0.03382193
the movie so for him to finally put that cowboy hat down for the final,0.11642843
time was really effectively done and then just a far-away shot of the dog sitting,0.23493631
and waiting in front of the garage and just these red and blue lights blinking,0.062229924
that was pretty much all we needed to see in terms of Jack's suicide so,0.41227236
I like that you know I'm like 13 reasons why he that showed shot-for-shot how,0.22857866
she did it I like how that was just handled in a very sensitive way,0.04551253
all right my seven for this movie speaking of the dog is the dog oh,0.055809572
my god I just thought that dog is so cute I believe that's Bradley Cooper's,0.056034405
dog actually in real life and his name is Charlie and the scenes with Bradley,0.087476306
Cooper and the dogs specifically playing in the backyard like had we dying so yeah,0.20744883
shout out to the dog and my final part of this movie is the title,0.08515216
card I thought the title card was so stunning and I loved how as the,0.021121576
title card was revealing itself Lady Gaga was singing somewhere over the rainbow which is,0.076905206
obviously an homage to Judy Garland who of course was in Stars born which is,0.03604364
great the minute I saw that title card I was like Bradley Cooper and Lady,0.074691474
Gaga are not around so great title card all right so my first con of,0.03598577
this movie is the pacing and a link so in terms of pacing I felt,0.053700276
like the beginning of the movie everything was happening so fast which I guess in,0.030431487
a way makes sense because it's a bit of a whirlwind about Lady Gaga's characters,0.06604608
being swept into the world of jacks entertainment music singing business world so I could,0.0728436
kind of excuse that but then by the second hour I did feel like there,0.021555277
were moments when if dragged and that kind of perfectly segues into the length of,0.03737068
this film in terms of it being like two hours and 15 minutes I believe,0.02836609
that is really really long even though I enjoy watching this film I felt you,0.05256414
could have easily cut out 30 minutes from this film so it wouldn't drag as,0.04538548
much as it did all right so my second cons this movie is I didn't,0.018616494
necessarily buy into Ali now suddenly be a star the thing is it's like they,0.016514514
had the right steps to show that suddenly Ali gets approached by the manager and,0.021196742
now she has backup dancers now she has a brand new wig there's her billboard,0.08107857
and she's now performing at Saturday Night Live and now she won the Best New,0.020135773
Artist Grammy like they had all of those steps but in spite of all of,0.08636013
that I still didn't necessarily buy into the fact that now this person Ali is,0.010942271
like a huge megastar I don't know if it's because Ali was still very much,0.074171305
isolated from her fame in terms of who was always her and Jack just living,0.099572
in that house together and he never really saw like paparazzi following her around or,0.049012728
he never saw a new social circle trying to get into Ali's camp I don't,0.022731321
know who was missing those elements but when her narrative art started to take this,0.03184234
turn of Ali is now becoming a star and now she's a big superstar it,0.04179149
was like really her all right - my third con - this movie is in,0.06045455
spite of the title this movie being called a star sport I definitely felt like,0.030672284
it had more of a focus towards of Bradley Cooper's character which I was like,0.012603899
it's a little bit misleading and for me like that really started again to take,0.088447474
place more so in the second hour versus the first hour because in the first,0.036605056
hour I felt like it was very much equal parts her story in his story,0.03599109
and I did feel a little bit there was more of a focus on her,0.045375504
in the first hour but then again kind of like what I was saying earlier,0.047670387
when her narrative art became now her stars on the rise I felt like the,0.014473731
focus wasn't on her as much as I would have liked it to have been,0.07312364
or maybe it was really because Bradley Cooper's story was just being told more convincingly,0.012101021
and it was more interesting for me personally to watch when I was listening to,0.030706208
a review of the Barbra Streisand version of the stars for Barbra Streisand she directed,0.0443152
that and I heard like there was more of a focus on her character versus,0.023269454
her male counterpart in that and again that make sense because the movies called stars,0.07662051
porn so focusing on Barbara not to say Bradley Cooper since he's the one that,0.3107104
directed it was being selfish or anything like that I don't think that's what what's,0.03438467
happening but maybe unconsciously the narrative focus became more about his character potentially because he,0.01563248
was the one directing it because for me I personally felt that Bradley Cooper's narrative,0.017215617
arc in the second hour was more the crux of the story and it was,0.010481299
really like the heart of this story and if anything I felt like Lady Gaga's,0.043642033
character ally in that second hour especially in that last half-hour was serving more of,0.014931377
a purpose in Bradley's narrative art alright my fourth con to this movie is personally,0.037119243
I felt a bit shortchanged in terms of a particular scene that I wish would,0.04722471
have gotten and that is I wish we would have seen or gotten hints of,0.012955117
Ali's reaction upon first finding out that Jack had committed suicide the movie got us,0.119292706
emotionally invested in these two as a couple we saw the first moment when they,0.019450635
meet each other for the very first time we saw the story of them falling,0.044694353
in love with one another and we just saw all the nitty-gritty details of that,0.049887445
relationship the ups and the downs and for me Jack's suicide and her finding out,0.6135913
for the very first time what had happened to him is an essential part of,0.015855318
this couples story for me personally I felt like we were robbed of that and,0.034098644
we deserve to see that moment it would have definitely been devastating and hard to,0.14168744
watch but I still think in terms of telling the story of this couple that,0.017077925
is a very important element of their story I wish we would have gotten that,0.010561786
scene even if it wasn't necessarily we see like the whole conversation of them telling,0.015822724
Ali this is what happened like if they would have just showed police officers coming,0.064460285
into Ali's dressing room Ali being confused and then right as the cameras about to,0.016572386
enter the room the door shuts like that's all we need we I just wanted,0.100305706
some insinuation okay Ali is about to find out right now what has happened to,0.0460786
Jack all right this is the scariest con that I have honestly I'm a little,0.040729858
nervous to say this because I don't want the Lady Gaga fans to attack me,0.26347128
no offense to her I think she's a phenomenal very talented artist but I will,0.055487625
say quick disclaimer I'm a really really huge Whitney Houston fan like I love Whitney,0.031282257
Houston prior to watching this movie I did hear that there was a song that,0.043586824
was gonna be performed at the very end of this movie by Lady gaga and,0.16036381
this was supposed to be like Lady Gaga's I will always love you I'm referring,0.051834434
to I'll never love again as the song started I thought it was really pretty,0.04998855
but then there's something that happens in the song where it's suddenly I'm not a,0.014477722
music for digger he thinks I don't know how to articulate this in the correct,0.10608282
technical form but this song suddenly starts sounding very very similar to a ballad that,0.04238417
would have come out of the 90s I think what for me hurts me the,0.06282859
most is this song did it sound like any of the other songs that we,0.034188446
had listened to throughout the duration of this movie again I'm a huge Whitney stand,0.057990044
and in my personal opinion I just feel like this song sounds like it's trying,0.03803254
so hard to be liked and I've always loved you at the end of the,0.058570087
movie just my personal opinion but what I will say you know which song I,0.020661935
really really loved and I wish was actually in the movie and wasn't just an,0.046888795
credits song is that Alright it sounds like it's in the same family as the,0.026906678
other songs we heard throughout this entire movie I wish is that all right would,0.020701846
have played a larger role in the actual movie itself but yeah in my personal,0.039697494
opinion as a Whitney Stan I'll never love again is just not I will always,0.047615174
love you alright so my overall rating for this movie I am going to give,0.067205496
it a solid solid a - I know a lot of people attend - I,0.038646504
roll whenever there is a new Hollywood movie about the entertainment business or show business,0.022869678
and how difficult it is for these entertainers trying to achieve their dreams and while,0.065195315
those kinds of stories may be oversold to the general public and why definitely isn't,0.013087488
the most original story considering that this is the fourth time that this movie has,0.022668794
been remade what sets this movie apart is the performances of Bradley Cooper and Lady,0.101875536
gaga and how real these characters felt and how much you genuinely as an audience,0.078550205
member grew to have a lot of compassion and empathy for these characters as you,0.06488866
saw them struggling to navigate show business this movie does a really great job with,0.023010032
just showing the general pitfalls that one may face when working in the entertainment industry,0.04318372
whether it's addiction issues or trying to stay true to who you are and what,0.044721626
you have to say as an artist and alright that's about it for this video,0.11280184
