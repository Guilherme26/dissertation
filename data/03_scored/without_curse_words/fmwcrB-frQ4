a phone system man once again and welcome back to another review and this is,0.050979353
thanks to a nice guy named Cody Lane 618 who had sent me in this,0.09732028
film rear window which this was actually nice to see because I had seen a,0.16310227
lot of films that took notice from rear window and all out of those films,0.14994793
I enjoyed because I enjoyed disturbia which was sort of rear window for teenagers mimic,0.25930667
3 which I did like maybe 3 it was a lot better than amendment 2,0.054939166
I like number 3 because I like there was a rear window type of story,0.138126
but using the mimic storyline I love road games with Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee,0.04445857
Curtis that was pretty much a rear window but in a moving vehicle in Australia,0.1512368
loved road games abominable that was a film with a guy played by Matt McCoy,0.19216748
was in a wheelchair out in the I'm this cab in the woods and you,0.23627672
dealing with a Bigfoot type of creature and I mean it's called abominable and they,0.4398901
had a real window stuff to it I just I loved that motif no I,0.080152415
have not seen the remake with Christopher Reeve maybe one day down the road but,0.06530394
I thought were windowed they did a good job I thought it was nice to,0.09226889
see the original after seeing all the tapes on it now I just say I,0.08897943
enjoyed this film I liked this film I can easily say this is one of,0.08940487
my favorite outfit Hitchcock films this and the birds I would say the bird is,0.06440361
them along and this is a close number - I thought Jimmy Stewart did a,0.05836039
great job in this role Grace Kelly was beautiful and actually a pretty decent actress,0.07637145
but I always say Grace Kelly send the scenes that the way hitch got shot,0.24003874
her and you know her coming to camera may look just absolutely beautiful if someone,0.19309832
asked what's what's a if you name what's the most beautiful woman you've seen on,0.18727924
screen I might have to say Grace Kelly in this movie cuz she was absolutely,0.13704155
gorgeous absolutely gorgeous in this movie and what's nice is Ashley has a pretty good,0.15437283
documentary real window ethics remembering and restoring the Hitchcock classic as well as a few,0.1503888
other features part of this collection I mean the story I mean when professional photographer,0.06617543
JB Jeff Jeffries James Stewart is confined to a wheelchair with a broken laid he,0.34902215
becomes obsessed with watching the private dramas of his neighbor's play out across the courtyard,0.08080036
and that's not actually interesting way hitched I doing that without words you just see,0.18416551
him sleeping he has a broken leg in a wheelchair and then going to a,0.4591183
pitcher he took up a racetrack and looks like a car coming towards them and,0.3783896
then other pictures so you get the eye and a broken camera to get the,0.11302993
idea that doesn't have to explain you did piece it together yourself and also a,0.09286029
picture of this woman on this magazine which is Grace Kelly which he probably took,0.1786957
that picture and of course you have this thing where Jimmy Stewart what's to keep,0.06850185
doing his job and Grace Kelly's like well you know what how'd you know you,0.08282918
should work at the fashion magazine that I'm at and I'm thinking Jimmy Stewart it's,0.066565
creased look at look at this girl look how this girl looks just say yes,0.43985075
and do whatever the hell she wants but that's like what do you do why,0.4031442
do you say no Jimmy Stewart it's Grace Kelly it's I'll be like yes ma'am,0.07929353
as long as you sit on my face I will photograph you for magazines her,0.69542736
forever but I know dirty 30 but I mean and like him watching the people,0.38653925
even sight there's this woman who's very lonely and they had this other woman who,0.40326762
seems very I know if you will call sexual you know she I would say,0.5876557
she's I wouldn't say settled more of like you know as a dancer and revealing,0.24240455
and clothing that's much as you can back to 1954 yeah this couple have this,0.074502714
dog up above you have this newlyweds who pull the shade down and you can,0.2849999
guess what they're probably doing and you have this sort of guy who seems like,0.16971502
he has a dominating wife and the guys actually played by Raymond Burr and went,0.07286762
cream and burr holy like the guy from the American version of Godzilla can the,0.15388533
monsters it's called and Godzilla 1985 that Raymond Burr is the villain in this movie,0.24199465
my holy the guy from the American version of the original Godzilla and the American,0.07532559
version of Godzilla 1985 from Gaza Latino the monsters and Godzilla 1985 the brain member,0.5876557
that remembers the villain in this I never realized that before I pop this disc,0.20593797
in I'm like that guy sounds familiar window oh that's Raymond Burr and he also,0.13871613
have like a guy playing a piano who I think the guy playing the piano,0.15395391
is the guy who created the the Chipmunks Dave Seville like the guy who became,0.14920364
the character de Sevilla he traded the chip month I believe dr. Brown I believe,0.053858045
the guy playing the piano is that guy I could be wrong I could be,0.15611112
wrong hey Chuck will quick rod Bagdasarian Ross not wrong Ross Bagdasarian he was betting,0.10545106
on by the stage name David Seville he was the trader of Alvin and the,0.06468967
Chipmunks so yeah the creator of elder and the Chipmunks is the guy playing the,0.07245085
piano in this which I thought Ian kind of pretty interesting fun to see I,0.09963515
think that's actually where Hitchcock has his cameo is during one of those scenes I'm,0.09704307
with the the guy playing the piano the songwriter it pretty much another one I,0.10596305
hadn't mentioned I was on my films that are like rear window the original Fright,0.24253178
Night love the original Fright Night the beginning part that has a bit of a,0.10333339
rear window Lisa first third of the movie has a little bit of a real,0.14483415
window vibe to it but then he hears this glass break and someone says don't,0.085776515
and pretty much throughout he keeps seeing this neighbor doing weird things like going out,0.12905839
late at night and carrying the suitcase and then the woman's not there and then,0.1885872
you know it's like he's he's dating in the dardan and the dog keeps barking,0.28814605
at the Raymond burse character and later on the dog is found dead with his,0.24042995
neck broken I'm he asks you know this guy who's a cop who I thought,0.47304517
he did good job to 1 del Korie I thought the acting was good throughout,0.07629751
I think everyone did their job well he has some little bit of fun back,0.15189186
and forth between him and Jimmy Sorrento course he doesn't believe Jimmy Stewart I thought,0.116056725
Jimmy Stewart did a great job you know just try and get someone to believe,0.094958454
him and then Grace Kelly starts to believe him and she starts helping out I,0.06624763
like that idea as well because it's not Grace Kelly being an a Dean oh,0.15285662
yeah oh you for this like they won't say cos it's the 50s but you're,0.17032607
full of know he they don't do that I thought it was nice that she,0.20600127
started to believe in her maybe I first uh you know saw a bridge a,0.1435866
gap between them but I thought that was it was the same vision you know,0.108524606
he was a beautiful girl good actress but also she wasn't a nagging she was,0.2757442
so helping him out and also sort of the show that she can be a,0.08885989
little bit adventurous as well I pretty much I like pretty much the entire film,0.20830052
is from Jimmy Stewart's home well you don't really ever step out of Jimmy Stewart's,0.07822869
home which I thought was interesting and the way it was filmed I mean for,0.06639472
I understand how was it that Jimmy Stewart's place was the floor of the studio,0.084189914
and then all the stuff here was like they took it out and used the,0.07773814
basement be like think of Jimmy Stewart's place here and then the studio here's the,0.060542807
basement so they clean up the basement they used all that and build like this,0.069184676
entire neighborhood inside a studio and it mates so the Hitchcock can have some really,0.09419117
cool shots the way it's all filmed in the way that Jimmy Stewart's right there,0.093925595
and he can actually see everything there I thought the movie kept going at a,0.046300683
good pace I always I don't know if I say always but usually with this,0.06922085
kind of plot it just keeps me interested yeah I don't know that makes me,0.11394852
a voyeur I just like watching people but I just like the idea of a,0.07241954
character being stuck in one place for some reason either Chazz he's in a wheelchair,0.27437618
or you know he's a truck driver and you know that's his job or mm,0.17160504
III like the guy is very sick almost like a boy in the bubble type,0.73431253
of shape so he can't leave I always like the oh of course Jimmy Stewart,0.090899184
his leg is broken the fact that they're stuck in this one place and this,0.18902785
whole world is enveloping and coming up in front of them and in a way,0.1543321
they can't go anywhere they just just using these pieces here to soar you as,0.24118821
the viewer are in the same spot as your main protagonist what does that mean,0.06619453
what did that part mean hmm that's what they're doing I wonder what they're doing,0.06336654
yeah I mean think about it have if you there are times where I've been,0.09378347
once a while when I go on a long trip where you look at someone,0.18267663
driving a car you go I wonder what they're doing wonder what their life is,0.09239685
I wonder you know what's going on where they're going where they've been you know,0.07714476
that sort of curiosity I think it's that curiosity where you know you're trapped in,0.1501638
one place and you're seeing this world and it's also a mystery like what's going,0.115541734
on what's that what's that I don't know what it is it's that I thought,0.098361015
it was a great idea that I'm you know a lot of people a lot,0.10055893
of films took from rear window and I think it's a great I wanna say,0.16634065
genre but it's a gimmick it's a great gimmick the idea the one person being,0.09049401
stuck in a place or and they're in this one thing and they're watching from,0.122029595
the outside and they're observing from the outside and then because usually what happens is,0.04462287
that outside all Sun comes into where they're at right now and it's sort of,0.05247903
it's you're on the outside and then it just leaps into their life and also,0.17962255
because of course by the end they gotta be in danger and what you think,0.15318428
is safe it's not safe anymore but the final confrontation between Jimmy Stewart and Raymond,0.06919526
Burr would udn interesting stuff that Hitchcock does like Jim Easter uses the flash is,0.05303957
there when the flashes of blinds again the screen goes like this red and then,0.11454009
it dissipates Talent if you were blinded which I did Lou entrances to fight that,0.13191006
ideas Ellen you almost have at least for me you're trying to like Jimmy Stewart,0.15038629
your trial does that girl use the dancer and okay that's what's wrong with that,0.24134846
girl all that girl's lonely and all know she might commit suicide on you well,0.8398932
you're almost like Jimmy Stewart's shoes and seeing you know what getting pulled in to,0.12838405
see what these people are doing that now also this it's almost like you're trying,0.078695625
to solve the mystery with Jimmy Stewart I think that's another thing when you're kind,0.07589904
of with the proton is tagging is because you're seeing what they're seeing in a,0.10587486
way you're hearing what they're hearing for the most part I mean once a while,0.09942438
hitch God does something where like we the audience see about Jimmy Stewart see it,0.07837295
but it's always from within the inside of that room that Jimmy Stewart's in idea,0.0933861
I think that is this for the most part you're on the same page as,0.07459485
your lead character so in a way you know what they know from Adam for,0.13077593
the majority you know as much as they know and you're trying to solve as,0.05803065
much as they're trying to solve and trying to piece together well may miss this,0.051406562
and this I mean to again the a lot of moves I enjoy enjoyed disturbia,0.10793274
road games Fright Night the original Fright Night I can't think of one that did,0.053006873
this and I didn't write now that I think about it cuz the freighting I,0.064586714
remade didn't even attempt that which f you don't remake it why don't you just,0.28226745
do it from the whole film be like rear window but with a vampire hell,0.3745398
if you don't remake Fright Night the beginning / a friend was rear window why,0.12354763
you just had the whole movie like that but then if you want to do,0.1162499
a foot in disturbia which once while I seem like they wanted you I think,0.17969896
I swear I heard one of them mention in the making of whatever the hell,0.4328655
it was I don't know why you just go that route then they what I,0.15328558
know they tried well they up with the reman I don't think they even attempted,0.10551957
in the remake of Fright Night there's a lot of reasons why laugh film sucks,0.85530174
but even the woman who sort of once awhile comes by Jimmy Stewart the sort,0.15403883
help him with physical therapy I thought Thelma Ritter I believe is her name I,0.11061757
thought she she was pretty funny at times I when jamester was trying to eat,0.15365994
and she's describing I bet he killed her in the bathroom no Jimmy she was,0.69542736
trying to eat yeah you know in the he's clean like just the way she's,0.082458444
describing and jimster who's trying to eat and all son loses appetite because of it,0.26552072
and I thought Jimmy Stewart dude great James Stewart Jimmy Stewart I was saying this,0.047496133
is of the I haven't seen tons of stuff with Jimmy Stewart well the stuff,0.056489546
I've seen I was definitely say this is my favorite role of his it's just,0.081403196
the idea the idea works the way he should kind of filmed it the way,0.10920275
it was all shot in studio in the way of looks is well done Bri,0.13337594
still is beautiful play her reveal where his shots are pushed as a camera on,0.25250676
her and just one of those like looks like an angel type of Lord's Grace,0.116866514
Kelly and again she's knob Hey our beautiful girl you just say a hot girl,0.5876557
who can add great take that Megan Fox why people call you hot but you,0.5313144
can't add for this is a girl who's hot and cannot her name is Grace,0.41530275
Kelly so there you don't it can happen it's not impossible to have of course,0.11083319
that's if you think Megan Fox lesbian if not well then she's such both ways,0.7986592
well three ways and you know the third way of suckin but Michael Bay's dduk,0.80840594
but which I remember one time Michael Bay wanted to remake the birds now I,0.031099826
mentioned Michael Bay and talking about Hitchcock hopefully they'll never happen just that but yeah,0.075197205
I know there was a remake of this that Christopher Reeve had done something I,0.070735596
checked out one day down the road anytime soon but one day down the road,0.08391414
but what can I say about rear-window it's a film that's darn into classic this,0.50970304
I can understand not vertical Virgo I'm sorry everything I say in that review I,0.12118279
mean I do not like vertigo at all rear window I can believe as a,0.25266975
class and I never got bored I was always interested I liked the characters I,0.07926484
thought the acting was really good I thought I liked the the idea which started,0.069279596
from there is I don't know if there were films before this I did that,0.07136114
but there are I don't know about but I thought was well filmed I thought,0.06779669
hit shot do a job directing it get me interested involved it was pretty decently,0.31089434
suspenseful I mean his dad knows how to do that Grace Kelly's beautiful and she's,0.24251427
also not a bad actress at all Jimmy Stewart did a great job remember overall,0.11780138
trying to think if I miss him anything else screenplay by John Michael Hayes dude,0.15235542
good job with that based on the short story by Cornell Woolrich very well done,0.08242339
movie really nothing I can say bad about this film I really enjoyed rear window,0.27091318
it was nice to see the original way it was done you know I saw,0.07399589
all those films that had taken notes from this nice to finally see the original,0.10053342
and I was not disappointed so Lane 6:18 Cody thank you very much I'm glad,0.10994259
