true story I was super excited that you guys - dude thank you for watching,0.04552916
I'm very appreciative this is my first film movie review of the wonderful fantastic film,0.015097008
us anyway what are you talking about yes us which is written and directed and,0.020925347
produced by the amazing Jordan Peele this is his second film on his first was,0.042082842
get out if you have not seen that I highly recommend checking that out this,0.072013445
film runs about two hours and one minute for me I felt that going into,0.026701137
it I was like that's a half an hour too long like it should be,0.038919896
a clean hour and a half but watching it twice I felt that it is,0.013130725
a perfect amount of time and this story doesn't flounder at all it's very straightforward,0.030581819
everything's needed and it's a nice good two hours of your time um so tell,0.045795232
you a little bit about what the film is without giving these for e-alerts even,0.08297235
though I would love to really discuss that there is a twist and all of,0.044209436
the other things that go along with that I really just want people to go,0.036746074
in there with an open mind and so yeah this story starts off with this,0.016738681
beautiful dark-skinned african-american family going to taking a vacation trip to Santa Cruz which is,0.6314279
so cool to see like a black people on of each like can we just,0.441134
meet us about that they taking this vacation with their family and they meet their,0.02059342
doppelganger family that looks just like them and that is when things go awry and,0.07176201
the wonderful cast is Lupita Nyong'o wants to do shoddy right to Joseph and Evan,0.17122225
Alex I'm looking at my notes guys just to make sure I got everything right,0.045714747
they also meet up with their friends played by Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidegger I,0.013623626
pronounced sorry about pronouncing his blessing wrong I just want to say before I really,0.06607934
get started to review this film is that this is my first movie review and,0.020655949
the reason why I decided to do this was because as a child I used,0.045789246
to watch Roger Ebert's reviews or he would do the thumbs-up or thumbs-down and I,0.030946339
was the nerdy kid who like loved that I was obsessed with it like I,0.3211005
just really liked watching what these two men had to say about movies and it's,0.05465548
funny because I never perceive myself as being able to critique movies I mean I,0.045144018
did go to film school and but like who am I to discuss movies but,0.031433918
I'm like I want to be a part of the conversation and I think it's,0.028813094
super important I'm very passionate about filmmaking in films and I just really want films,0.017905414
to be attainable and digestible for audiences I feel like sometimes there can be a,0.021159492
loftiness even the fact that I'm calling them films in that movie it's really annoying,0.059306443
to me but um films and don't have to be scary and the honest trip,0.035711713
is like we can learn from ourselves about them and we can learn about the,0.027733501
world through films and they're just a super powerful tool that is used in our,0.027054349
society and it can be enjoyable they can be escapism and they can be dreadful,0.20767166
and they can be really bad sometimes you're like why did I waste an hour,0.060382046
and a half but what can I learn from that you know um so without,0.026151694
further ado that is why I started this and I'm so excited to talk about,0.035040542
movies with you guys and hear what you guys think about the movies that are,0.02564815
coming out overall score for the film is four scissors out of four scissors and,0.021141531
that's because the cinematography the editing the actors performances the script the score which is,0.01860186
the music that is playing along with the film was all just a beautiful weeping,0.04087088
I would say of a classic horror film um I going into it I knew,0.07285091
it was a horror film because Jordan Peele had tweeted being like this is a,0.04398394
horror film and I was like okay like this is not get out you know,0.1169466
and which was I would argue is a social thriller and I was ready for,0.07755908
that as a second film to get out it stands on its own as a,0.029444354
film it tells an interesting story that I haven't seen and it doesn't in a,0.025855688
like it's not he doesn't do it in a showy way you know some directors,0.045585036
are just he's not at that point as his career where there there like I,0.029888697
have to have the shot because I get to do it but he's still at,0.09617159
the point where it's like does this serve the story and of course that may,0.027664987
happen later in his career and that's okay like I think all directors have to,0.047277927
kind of take that path but right now he's being super authentic to what he,0.031541012
wants to say as a filmmaker and you can see it in the film like,0.018997645
it's it's very obvious the monologues he also wrote the script so the monologues lupita,0.035508834
that's a couple monologues in the film and they're just so beautifully written and so,0.014177059
beautifully performed and that is a Lupita's bringing her a-game in this but be the,0.035311274
director like you can't you can't deny that he like put his work into it,0.080093436
as well and his vision so it's super exciting to see you guys I mean,0.036247853
I was scared out of my mind when the movie ended I like turned on,0.07310102
all the lights when I came home and and did not sleep so well but,0.048012957
as a film it's people the second rating that I'll give that I think is,0.047691673
really important for movies is honest performance so I'm going to give that forces its,0.025207799
out of force is yours what another really good skill the performances I think are,0.05281026
honest for me and honest performance is when I see an actor give and what,0.022621565
I mean by that is my boss Catherine describes it in a really cool way,0.03316805
it worked like I have a ball and I'm gonna throw it at you and,0.35415688
it's just pass and that's what acting is it's just passing the ball and you,0.06451151
can see what actors do that really well when they're giving and you can see,0.020965923
when they're not doing it well this film Lupita Nyong'o oh praise be the heavens,0.13087888
that's my song of worship church but no but in all seriousness she gave like,0.053651717
um I was talking to my sister about this and she was just at this,0.09627802
place where she did her work like she went so dark and I would I,0.09799486
would argue that it was a place of pain that she went to and I,0.11689339
don't know where she called that from but you clearly see that on the screen,0.03544963
and it's haunting like it's one of the most haunting performances I've ever seen her,0.06582923
actors and from her personally was a beautiful performance so good job and the kids,0.030691573
were also really amazing kid actors can be difficult to work with and kid actors,0.023053935
who both have to play themselves and their counterparts the doppelganger is so the fact,0.022751942
that they did that in such a beautiful way also applies to Jordan because he,0.046147116
got that out of them but also cause the kids because they were giving in,0.045799226
their performances the only thing that I will say the twins that play like Elizabeth,0.07879699
Lucis mas has her family and she has two twins they were the only people,0.03734474
that I noticed were a little not with it and then this third thing I'll,0.042738713
score this film on is diversity in front of and behind the camera what that's,0.06519731
a category we're gonna score on that yes we is yes we is I would,0.030991571
give it for it for what is this a perfect film I have a Guinness,0.032841448
and the reason I'm going to do that is because in front of the camera,0.056083627
our cast is completely african-american black whatever you want to call yourself that is a,0.4172937
huge deal not only that I think Jordan is a beautiful job of casting dark-skinned,0.46734396
um african-american people and that's super important because many times light-skinned actors are favored and,0.3181291
so to see a dark-skinned family like I said on the screen not talking about,0.51640904
slavery was a beautiful beautiful thing thank you Charlie so yes diversity in front of,0.31520522
was amazing another thing I want to say as diversity behind the cameras I think,0.073405676
that just if not it's just as important and Michael Abel's also apologized to them,0.018819375
pronouncing your last name wrong the composer was african-american which is amazing the score is,0.18712215
one of the most beautiful scores and haunting sports I've ever heard I mean it,0.03374144
just if you don't like or just listen to the soundtrack like it's that good,0.062405534
Jordan of course counts for all of the above line basically and that's really what,0.025716664
I'm doing here for the diversity also you guys forget on the camera I don't,0.038896613
know how diverse their costume department was ordered you know I could go a tiny,0.050484776
pre-pro and really dig into it and that's maybe what I'll do in future but,0.06892633
right now I'm just gonna stick with the above-the-line who was diverse about there and,0.034302857
then also in front of the camera um so pretty good on diversity standards so,0.03449975
my overall review again for four I will say that you should I would highly,0.09587957
recommend doing Roger Ebert to thumbs-up to go see this film it is a horror,0.11394796
film it scary so if you're not down with that do not see it but,0.03985381
I also don't like I'm not huge on horn but I knew that this was,0.03818154
important for me to see this film and I kind of just had to get,0.04069527
over it and build a bridge and get over uhm and go see it I,0.09057672
will say without giving spoilers the film deals with really interesting topics of privilege of,0.017558852
the Forgotten of judgment and honestly dealing with this dialogue that I think we're having,0.036450732
in our country of us versus them and it's something that he does in such,0.09636915
a it's such an interesting and intricate and not heavy-handed way get out was super,0.035744973
clear it was like this is America and this is what we're dealing with and,0.04183207
this was like this is America but let's let's do what that and a more,0.038791515
you had to chew through it like you had a really munch on this it,0.14787498
wasn't so clear I think I mean it was clear for me but you know,0.053000502
everyone's gonna perceive it differently of what he's talking about and I love that like,0.025318885
seeing in a second time I was like oh this clue oh this clue as,0.031212412
a filmmaker that's like I mean that's gold to be able to see it I'm,0.025370104
filming a second time and like look at how he did this shot and look,0.13743493
at what that t-shirt says in the background and looking what that kid said on,0.042499248
the beach like everything he just like dropping it and it's just beautiful to munch,0.15646915
on and I'm still honestly munching on this movie it's a weird word to use,0.06625828
to describe a film but it's satisfied Jordan what he's doing is giving african-americans a,0.18973498
space to be in the horror genre which i think is really amazing and very,0.06719352
cool because I never saw my myself reflected in horror and not until get out,0.062231258
I was like oh this is a drummer that's exciting and cool and that I,0.028423296
could be a part of and honestly I'm just excited to see what he does,0.03434942
next so goes to the movie thank you guys so much for watching thanks for,0.015295233
watching based on a true story remember that your story is important so go out,0.014415195
