nearly two years since the last Pixar film and five years since the last great,0.029804884
and memorable one and when they announced that they weren't gonna be releasing a film,0.03382193
in 2014 in order to restructure their company it got a lot of people wondering,0.026923308
what's next for Pixar have they run out of new ideas are they just gonna,0.061865404
resort to prequels and sequels or they're gonna try to reinvigorate themselves and come up,0.039320335
with new concepts and ideas what would be the fate of Pixar so when they,0.05426302
announced that their next film was going to be an original story called inside out,0.037611477
I'm not gonna deny it I thought that sound like a very intriguing concept and,0.049018048
it just had so much promise to it not only did have a star-studded cast,0.04231566
but it also was being directed and co-written by Pete docter one of the heads,0.07567861
of Pixar Animation Studios and without a doubt the funniest director they have there with,0.03947333
such hits as Monsters Inc and the very touching up and with all those elements,0.14289077
put together what you got is a winning combination in a return to form for,0.03812633
Pixar now for those of you who actually sat through the entirety of my top,0.05120983
10 favorite Pixar films sorry for the length not only do I applaud you but,0.039107475
you might also recall that I said in that video that Monsters Inc was without,0.08690358
a doubt the funniest Pixar film I've ever seen right we'll move over monsters Inc,0.06041597
because there's a new sheriff in town and that is inside out inside out has,0.05078145
now replaced monsters Inc as the funniest Pixar film I have ever seen and it's,0.08645857
so coincidental because it's from the same guy that made monsters inc this film had,0.17359097
my best friend Steven and I in stitches we were laughing hysterically throughout we almost,0.03436871
teared up and how funny these scenes were and there were a lot of clever,0.039453372
and witty jokes throughout the film there's this one joke in particular that is without,0.022062812
a doubt the most clever joke I ever heard in a film and not to,0.033344325
give away the punch line of the joke but it has to do with deja,0.054463908
vu that joke was just a stroke of genius with most of that hilarity being,0.08633618
attributed to the characters in the film particularly the five emotions just the way they,0.0060964082
would react to the everyday situations that Riley would get into and the interactions among,0.031417955
themselves priceless pure comedic gold and speaking of gold whoever was the casting director for,0.02182002
this film they did a perfect job at picking who should voice the five emotions,0.057915546
I mean seriously any boy is joy perfect Phyllis from the office has sadness perfect,0.037983317
Mindy calling has disgust perfect Lewis Black has anger holy crap give that person a,0.6258578
raise that is without doubt the best call anybody could make for anger and he,0.036756717
was just enjoying every second of it and every Louis black is immune Emerson it,0.1301618
just was missing a rat that's all I was missing the only emotion that I,0.1801743
was kind of so-so about was Bill Hader as fear not to say that he,0.05302046
didn't do a great job he did a fantastic job it's just I felt like,0.051024243
he wasn't really the person that I would say yeah he personifies fear I never,0.09158115
really see that I could see somebody else doing it but again he did really,0.019327575
good he did a solid job as fear and I really enjoyed the pairing of,0.055721767
joy sadness complete opposites having to work together get back to headquarters it freakin writes,0.29634768
itself but they actually do end up growing a rather strong bond through this experience,0.027039716
with joy really growing as a character and realizing that joy cannot be the only,0.045623615
emotion that this girl has to feel they all have to work together as a,0.0973004
team so that she has a great mix of emotions now the concept and story,0.032997765
the concept itself is intriguing really unique and overall creative something that has been missing,0.011535615
from Pixar in the last five years and I'm just so glad that it's finally,0.026720427
back the idea of these emotions personified in your mind that regulate your emotional output,0.076069735
is just a refreshing idea and the story is not just solid but extremely relatable,0.018724255
especially for people particularly kids who have to move from place to place because their,0.15615386
parents jobs demanded of them and have to leave behind everything they knew and love,0.08677121
ask anybody who's ever gone through this and they'll tell you that it is such,0.04656618
an emotional experience to have to leave behind everything you knew love and have to,0.070051156
get acclimated to a new area I have went through that many at times and,0.08861577
I really related to Riley's dilemma in the film and one of the final most,0.010020327
emotional scenes in the film really resonated with me as it was something that I,0.033590443
also experienced and finally the animation Wow I went in Reverse with this review but,0.012921858
the animation once again is solid but it's Pixar you kind of come to expect,0.06363679
that but I really like the look and design of the emotions they are just,0.014695902
on freaking planet they look so freakin fuzzy as if they were designed to become,0.4942096
toys not so some of their Pixar not so simple Who am I kidding I'm,0.06175831
probably gonna buy them all anyway now though my experience with this film is mostly,0.05426834
positive I do have a few slight issues with the film the first one is,0.016670832
the pacing of the film was a bit slow in some places particularly the long,0.0484267
term memory sections I mean it just felt like it would drag on for free,0.0496972
and ever and ever which makes sense there in the long-term memory which is like,0.01457617
this huge maze like place but it also ended up becoming really repetitive with them,0.078879476
being so close yet so far were being so close and it's just so far,0.03114922
policy the biggest fault I found with this movie was with this character Bing bong,0.03643876
now keep in mind I'm not saying that he's a terrible character as I said,0.109891
this character seemed like he would work better in small doses like if he was,0.14549363
in the film for about five to ten minutes and then went on his merry,0.039650265
way that would have been perfect but this character overstays his welcome and stays with,0.03370685
the group for most of the journey and as the film went on the character,0.009373102
went from being whimsical innocent and playful to just overbearing and annoying like we just,0.15297894
have to keep dealing with this character leave him already but to be fair to,0.017526258
the character he does have some really good emotional scenes in the film but they,0.010382852
would have had a bigger impact had he not lingered around for so long but,0.058455672
you know what even with those small issues this is a great film and a,0.021943742
true return to form for Pixar animation studio and I'm just so glad that they're,0.01857725
back and I'm glad that they chose this film to be their comeback film because,0.03768199
I'm gonna give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars I think that it is,0.018661061
