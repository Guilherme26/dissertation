in many ways Star Wars the last Jedi is the perfect Star Wars movie not just from a fan's perspective but also from Disney's because it becomes crystal clear that this franchise is never going anywhere literally so much happens and yet nothing happens there are so many deaths and yet nobody dies basically at the end of the movie you realize for as much fun as you had watching it although I don't know if everybody's gonna have that experience we'll get to that but even I who loved every minute of it well almost every minute of it but still I even had to realize that we were at the exact same place that we were when the movie started and that's unfortunate or is it if these movies keep making so much money I mean to be honest I predict that casual fans will fall away because of the episodic nature that's taking over get it episode 8 of infinity episodes but there are so many Star Wars fans from hardcore to casual that I think it will continue to do very healthy business anyway I mean I'll keep watching them if they're this good so on that note what exactly did I love about the movie alright so it's a long list yay first the movie is very much a Saturday morning cartoon like it took me a couple of moments to understand the tone I was like what are you doing you're crazy like general Hux this is a non-spoiler review so I can't give anything away but let's just say the movie starts with general Hux and at first I was like this is horrible but then I realized what they were doing and I was like this is fabulous accepting what the franchise is but they're turning the episodes into not the spin-off movies but the episodes once you accept that it's a lot of fun right so next up boy is this movie funny it's surprisingly funny remember in the force awakens when the stormtroopers were walking down the hall and they saw that kylo Ren was throwing a temper tantrum and they turned around and walked way more of that but just so much more of that and I loved it like Undercover Boss kind of humor to some degree and by that I mean not just clever but almost in some ways self-aware what you I loved I don't know how all Star Wars fans or other people are gonna feel about it but it was perfect for me but also by extension there's a very strong focus on average joes that populate this world and I love me some average Joe moments they're my favorite thing and more than anything they make me feel like I could be a part of this world so I thought that was great it's like there are no small parts in Star Wars I thought that was fabulous there are also a couple of great battle sequences in the movie and will some people find battle sequences boring I am NOT one of those people like if you loved the big battle secret sequence at the end of rogue one then you will love this movie because this is definitely an extension of that I mean I could watch x-wing formations all day long I would love to pilot an x-wing now next there are also some stunning visual moments here and one in particular that was heightened by an audience members response in fact it instantly became one of my best movie going experiences of all time and I will tell you about it in the spoiler review I wish that this person could be in every one screening to say what she did at that moment because it would make the movie better for everybody it was great alright then next although I have to say for the most part you could hear a pin drop in the theater people were paying rapt attention but also I really enjoyed the practical effects which made the porks and some other characters that we can't talk about have the quaint cozy factor that so many characters did in the original trilogy I mean you knew they were puppets but I know that was great and I and I love porks by the way I went in hating porks but now I hope that they never ever go away and by the way I would like to say that of all the merch that I've seen so far the copious pork merch none of it has captured the fabulous essence of the porks so I hope they keep working on it because I'd like to buy something with a poor guy on it now but I haven't seen anything that would again captures the spirit of the porks from the movie they're so funny now what did I what did I not like personally right wasn't anything that I didn't like about the movie or a Myka saying only other people are gonna have problems no I'm afraid I had some problems Jim as I said nothing really happens so it's difficult for me I know some people who aren't really into Star Wars and they didn't like the force awakens and that that bro Guan was a little boring I know right how could you find although the beginning rogue one once you've seen it a couple times you start to understand where people are coming from but anyway it's hard for me to recommend this movie to them cuz I'm like I think you might be bored but I don't see how you could miss it either but also the pacing is off like two thirds in even I was like dude I love what you're doing here but it's taking you way too long and then on that note I think it was a mistake I don't want to give too much away but I think it was a mistake I'll just say this for the rebels to basically be parked for most of the movie and the rebels come across is pretty incompetent by the way like wow they got a really step up their game they're starting to embarrass themselves however I would like to add though that I'm amazed that self-sacrifice and war has become such a big part of Star Wars after rogue one and now the last Jedi that is such a complex adult sophisticated concept and it's crazy that family-friendly Star Wars from Disney would become the franchise that best embodies that and promotes that I mean it makes her some of the most emotional emotional gut punches of the movie I mean they work their earned they're not cheating they really I was amazed by them in fact however it does seem that that's the rebels only strategy and considering the real world history of that from kamikaze Flyers to what's happening across the globe today like ripped from the headlines I would just be really careful about romanticizing that Star Wars you have your moments you didn't cheat you earn them but let's maybe move in a different direction okay especially because they keep doing it again and again and again as for the characters though I think the Kathleen Kennedy you know she's really been championing women in Star Wars and trying to really push them in the mythology right and she's been a little heavy-handed about it but I can say with the last Jedi that she finally found a balance in the force between female and male characters and a lot of that has to do with Rey and kylo Ren I liked them both a lot here and we have so much to talk about in this boiler review I loved it okay there's also Luke and Leia acting as a balance there's also Finn and Rose just really good equal gender representation men speaking of representation po by the way he has a lot of great moments here they really up to screen time and the character of benefits because of it however there was some question as to whether or not he was a member of the LGBT community I mean even Oscar Isaac seemed to be hinting at that but I can tell you in this movie that they have completely shut that down and stepped away from it and I think to some degree have even I think hinted of going in the other direction that's gone also for those looking to Finn for representation he continues to be a clownish character I liked john boyega's performance here he had some nice moments but boy do I wish that Finn had more dignity and they continue to really push this the space janitor angle you know for comedic effect tonight it is helpful but still he's supposed to you know represent something for a lot of people and it's unfortunate the movie though has some excellent villains I love them from the seriously menacing Snoke huge Snoke fan to the comedic ly sniveling general Hux again once I got general hooks I loved general hooks both Andy Serkis and Donald Gleeson damo Gleeson I always mispronounce his name but they are both huge assets to the movie but needs you del Toro and Gwendoline Christie though not so much finally while the battle sequences again are very well thought-out and visually striking they desperately need to hire a better fight choreographer because the lightsaber battles are unforgivably weak like wow so in conclusion I feel this is a don't miss for Star Wars fans and cinephiles because even though the sum is a bit satisfying the individual parts are just too good to miss also even if you're not into Star Wars you know what I say roll the dice because again there was so much here that was great there's so much that was so funny I just said go in anyway and prepare to be a bit bored you know what the more I think about it this reminds me a lot of Lord of the Rings you know everyone can share their moment when they dozed off and a Lord of the Rings movie or a hobbit movie right and speaking of The Hobbit this franchise that franchise ultimately became too boring to continue at least on the silver screen and that's something Kathleen Kennedy should keep in mind if you don't have some reinvention and you get too steeped in mythology even if you have a ton of like oh moments and this movie has them you know it's ultimately just not enough to continue boy with all the average Joe moments I'm like I really want that Disney streaming Star Wars series as well but anyway we can't talk about too much because this is my non-spoiler review of the last Jedi and I will definitely be seeing it again in theaters and I think that's a pretty high vote of confidence so now you can go see it for yourself and then join me for the spoiler review because if you're into this movie there is so much to talk about and until then of course you can always check out some other videos right now [Music]
