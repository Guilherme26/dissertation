hello everybody and welcome back to my channel if you're new here hi i'm mia tiffany and today we are going to be watching the highly recommended highly anticipated film casablanca and y'all,0.09037867
i am so excited to watch this film okay so casablanca was released in 1942 directed by michael curtis starring humphrey bogart as rick blaine ingrid bergman as ilsa lund and paul henried as victor laszlo with other notable performances by claude raines who we saw actually in mr smith goes to washington sydney greenstreet who we saw in christmas in connecticut and s z caskel who we've also seen in christmas in connecticut,0.19438972
so i'm excited to see all of them in this film so before we get into a little bit more of the film background,0.07810809
i kind of wanted to add in some historical background because there was a lot going on around this film,0.09992765
so if you want to stay and listen to the historical background please do so or if you want to skip right on to the film reaction you can do that too but without further ado let us get into some historical background okay so during the time of the film's release the world was at war,0.10255527
and because of that hollywood kind of shifted into more moral boosting and patriotic themes,0.11562374
and as we know casablanca is no stranger to these themes,0.15201613
in fact it was originally supposed to come out in 1943 however they pushed it to 1942 in order to align it with the allied forces successful invasion of north africa,0.16720752
now this invasion uh served as the first step in sort of weakening the axis powers hold on southern europe,0.12785871
and then in the very next year in january of 1943 the city of casablanca served as the location for the casablanca conference which was attended by fdr and winston churchill so not only did all of these events increase the popularity of the film also show the us's support for the allied forces,0.037578464
i also wanted to take a moment to shout out grouchy marks for adding,0.19970003
some of this information in the comments,0.06001634
thank you so much,0.046055414
also i really appreciated and loved your story about how your grandparents went to go see this film and all of the excitement in the movies so thank you again grouchy marks for sharing that with all of us,0.16595994
okay,0.050967902
so a quick synopsis of this film it says a cynical expatriate american cafe owner struggles to decide whether or not to help his former lover and her fugitive husband escape the nazis in french morocco some interesting things that i found about this film,0.31584388
so first of all this film was actually based off of an unproduced play called everybody comes to ricks written by murray burnett and joan allison,0.15503599
now they actually ended up selling the rights to warner bros for 20 000 which at the time was actually a record-breaking sum everybody who worked on this film did not anticipate the success that it would have it actually became the fourth highest grossing film in 1943 taking home,0.06496791
a whopping 10 million 462 500 in the domestic box office,0.11747939
it also was nominated for eight oscars three of which it won for writing directing,0.0674527
and then the big ticket one which is outstanding motion picture,0.037063256
yeah,0.040847696
so this film is very popular and had a lot of success and i'm so so so excited and so glad to be sharing this moment of my first time watching this with all of you i cannot wait to watch this film but before we do y'all already know the deal,0.10024706
if you haven't already please subscribe to my channel and hit that bell notification to stay in the loop alright everyone it is time the moment we've all been waiting for please get your drinks and your snacks,0.19042711
and let us get in to casablanca [Applause] also by the way i have all fruits,0.13175493
i have bananas and oranges because i am trying to be healthy,0.12100705
but i wish i had ice cream to all officers two german couriers carrying important official documents murdered and trained from iran murderer and possible accomplices headed for casablanca,0.41418254
okay i just want to explain really quick,0.0496556
so in the beginning they were saying that um to in order to escape,0.07686117
the nazis reign in europe,0.44199434
a lot of refugees traveled from paris down to casablanca and they're waiting to be able to go to lisbon and then to the new world which i'm assuming is america,0.11777323
so i just wanted to explain that because i feel like that might have gotten a little lost,0.13081828
it might get lost in the editing too so everyone is trying to leave casablanca to go to lisbon to go to america perhaps tomorrow will be on the plane,0.0826756
i kind of i feel for these people because they're essentially just sitting ducks you know waiting to be able to have enough money to go to to basically run to freedom like i just think about the time that they lived in and how much like stress and uproar and fear that was probably circulating around during the war,0.26881063
it's just really it's surreal like you don't think about it when you're comfortable in in 2021 just thinking about what happened in the past,0.10263117
but i just imagine what it must have been like for real,0.06761168
people who were trying to escape to freedom like that must have been really hard,0.09757817
there's claude rain unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca thank you captain it's very good to be here,0.13237004
majestrous are my aide lieutenant cassell so the actor who plays major heinrich strausser he was actually born in berlin,0.14922749
and he was publicly known to be anti-nazi,0.4680476
but the only way that he was going to play,0.06700218
this role of heinrich,0.1614957
strausser is if the as if the character was quote a villain with no redeeming qualities like he wanted to make sure that this character didn't have any sort of goodness in him,0.10312297
i guess which i thought was really interesting like that was his only um his only like i'll only play the role if xyz thank you,0.08831589
thank you and bring the 15 000 franks in cash remember in cash,0.058030557
gosh everyone is really trying to to get out i think they also suspect that or they they feel like,0.10259957
it's only a matter of time because at the time again the nazis were were storming all these different countries,0.45501256
so i i wonder if they thought that it's only a matter of time before the nazis come to casablanca,0.40309644
so i think that's why everyone just wants to get out as quickly as possible,0.09441036
oh humphrey bogart i love humphrey bogart and i say that honestly that he was actually the first male um love interest that i saw in the classic film the first classic film that i ever watched was sabrina with audrey hepburn and humphrey bogart and that began my love affair with classic films i absolutely love humphrey bogart letters of transit so are those are those the transit papers that the two germans had did,0.124023534
he must have gotten a hold of them,0.0778609
oh my goodness,0.06770506
so that makes him like a poi,0.24165186
what else,0.063992314
i'm noticing about this film is,0.08288703
there's a lot more motion in the camera,0.056179404
i can see that there's a lot more movement in the camera and the cinematography is is moving and and moving through rick's cafe and i also wonder if that's because of citizen king because i do remember reading that a lot of cinematography after that film was really inspired by that film again i i read it somewhere i i don't know if i'm 100 true,0.038757987
so if i'm wrong please correct me,0.11582354
but yeah i'm just noticing there's a lot more movement with the camera and a lot more pannings and and moving around as if you know we're kind of walking around with the characters and i really loved seeing that because usually the camera is very stationary,0.111996934
so it kind of has more of a modern feel to it which i really appreciate who's got nothing we got nothing how much,0.11098592
i don't know,0.1465787
why like i don't know why i get so excited to see actors that i've seen in previous films that we've watched on this channel because it's like duh actors they're in multiple projects,0.09052404
it's like seeing tom cruise and you know just another film but for some reason for me it's like oh my gosh like i know i know sydney greenstreet or i know claude rains like i've seen his work before,0.10263427
and it's just so exciting to be able to say that i know their work,0.0842557
but then also to see them you know in different characters in these old films,0.17183441
i i don't know i just get super excited if you guys have do you guys get excited like that,0.45705557
i don't know let me know in the comment box,0.099690385
if you do now i'm officially putting that song in my spotify playlist that was a lot of fun,0.14555879
yeah but i was stuck because he won i love you oh shut up so the actress that plays yvonne actually outlived all of the other cast members i don't believe she died until 2016. she died in 2016.,0.35481513
yeah that is what a life but how cool would it have been to to tell people,0.112467006
oh yeah i was actually a cast member in casablanca like that would be,0.27381817
so cool,0.03968372
i don't know who were you last night,0.2873082
that's so long ago i don't remember will i see you tonight,0.095698014
i never make plans that far ahead,0.13536969
i really love how humphrey bogart is playing into his cynicism it you really feel it from his character,0.44904524
and for some reason i just feel like it it,0.09402114
i don't know it just makes his character more which he's supposed to be cynical,0.33098844
but the way that he's playing it,0.08472875
it's like it's so believable,0.09850495
like he's he's a really good actor really good actor you would like to be on it every single time,0.25155494
there's a plane that goes through or a plane that takes off,0.09011898
it's very consistent the way that everybody reacts to it,0.06402037
you can tell that they're all just,0.06859665
they're just wishing that they were on that plane,0.09556003
but more so it's almost as if it's like a symbol of freedom which makes more sense because flying when you think of flying anything freedom but i just love the consistency of of how everyone reacts to a plane taking off,0.09222274
it's just goes to show how much care was taken into this screenplay absolutely there is a man arrived in casablanca on his way to america he will offer a fortune to anyone who'll furnish him with an exit visa what's his name victor laszlo no matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or i should say too why too,0.24126634
he's traveling with a lady,0.14991538
how convenient that there were two german couriers who were murdered for their exit visas,0.4289534
and now there are two people who need said exit visas to escape the nazis,0.44982603
i mean it most likely was done,0.055956777
intentionally are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans and their beloved paris not particularly my beloved paris,0.3525302
can you imagine us in london when you get there ask me so watching this,0.053570975
i feel like,0.03647269
i don't know,0.1465787
i didn't i didn't read this anymore,0.10432408
but this is just a hunch have you guys ever seen quentin tarantino's and glorious bastards,0.89674276
well this scene reminds me of the scene when they're like in the pub or like in the the bar and there's like tensions are heightened because michael fassbender's character is like a you know he's like a double agent,0.20169273
they're all sitting around the table,0.079472825
it really reminds me of this scene,0.10945112
so i don't know if this scene was influenced or that scene was influenced by this scene or if it was just kind of a coincidence which i don't feel like there are coincidences in in hollywood but i don't know it just it really reminds me of that scene oh and if you guys know if quentin tarantino really did get inspiration from this scene please let me know in the comment box,0.07971984
i would love to know that piece of information how about new york,0.13600302
well there are certain sections of new york major that i wouldn't advise you to try to invade uh-huh who do you think will win the war with the slightest idea i really appreciated that when he asked him who do you think will win the war and he's like i haven't the slightest idea that he didn't push,0.11942335
well it first of all,0.051345706
it's not even in his character to push which side would win,0.11550259
but i appreciate that they didn't make that into,0.05019867
uh oh we think americans are gonna win or we think the germans are gonna win like they made it very neutral which obviously fit for bogart's character,0.34726906
but i think that that that just had a little bit more of a innuendo in there like at the time they didn't know who was going to win the war,0.13103874
and there was a lot of fear that was like circled around who's going to win and what's gonna happen afterward,0.10818716
but i appreciate that they left that ambiguous because i feel like if they were to push it you know into the more patriotic side and say the americans are you know like the allied forces are gonna win,0.15975307
then i feel like it would have been a little bit too um like it wouldn't have it wouldn't have been realistic just obviously for the time that it came out i'm just really happy that they left that ambiguous so that it's not you know giving people false hope if the allied forces didn't win,0.14910978
oh so that's victor laszlo,0.10865176
thank you,0.039406788
but i hardly think then perhaps for the lady the ring is quite unique,0.13712539
oh yes,0.05304181
i'm very interested i love the spy elements of this movie too like there is a lot of like it almost feels like,0.06699164
i don't know if that's right like espionage,0.14622906
i don't know if that's the right word,0.09428225
but there's a lot of like spy elements in this film that the two german couriers for the transit papers got in play as time goes by sing it sam you,0.0746359
must remember this a kiss is just a key,0.10294099
wow what a beautiful the music in this movie kudos to max steiner,0.09319471
i i don't believe he's alive anymore but kudos to him for for using this music,0.27348092
and he's like why are you playing,0.087950915
this song bro,0.11439888
did you see that longing stare,0.15370649
i want to know the history there of all the gin joints and all the towns in all the world she walks into mine so under all that cynicism and under all that that he puts up there really truly is a sentimental man,0.45852366
i mean you can see it,0.091656305
and the way he's acting like the way that,0.09182321
he is almost longing for her like dang,0.31089434
i love flashbacks,0.06257968
so they had a love of a love affair,0.13739543
and penalty,0.17226334
we said no questions is looking at you kid,0.19192027
oh it's like the line,0.07424802
well one of the lines,0.062457647
but still why there is no other man in my life,0.15447088
that's easy that was,0.054815657
he's dead,0.6364068
i'm sorry for asking nothing kills a beautiful love story like war wednesday thursday at the latest they'll be in paris,0.24246038
they'll find out your record,0.068953186
it won't be safe for you here,0.13429898
i'm on a blacklist already i will say it is interesting to hear other accents like we on this channel,0.24469708
we've heard the british accent in the 1930s but ingrid bergman is from sweden and so to hear her accent on top of the like the 1930s way that they used to talk is very interesting,0.12077779
because it sounds very different than what a swedish accent sounds like,0.15713648
now this sort of takes a sting out of being occupied,0.26496273
does it mr,0.056173738
richard you said it he's looking at you kid,0.15405929
i didn't know,0.086647935
he said it multiple times in the movie i thought it was just honestly,0.082094274
i thought it was just that one time at the end like that one scene that they always show where they're like in the rain,0.051991902
but i guess he says it multiple times i love that though or is it my heart pounding,0.12783828
so this may ruin some parts of this movie for you,0.3563214
and i apologize in advance,0.14911798
so ingrid bergman was two or three inches taller than humphrey bogart which means that whenever they whenever they did scenes together,0.31781185
they had humphrey either stand on the platform or they tied like boxes like platforms to his shoes to make him seem taller than ingrid,0.17396271
and then ingrid would would be acting barefoot,0.31089434
and so that i just think it's funny because during the romantic scenes you want to be like,0.14684291
oh it's so romantic,0.1071442
and then you think to yourself but he's standing on a platform at that point no no no no we must leave,0.15101036
yes of course we the train for my saili's,0.05428867
at five o'clock,0.09733024
i'll pick you up at your hotel at 4 30. christmas if it were the last time,0.17318812
so another random piece of movie fact so this scene,0.15198526
well this flashback scene was one of the first scenes that they shot in the production schedule and humphrey bogart was like he's like i don't want to shoot these scenes because i'm not like all about that romance life or something like that,0.5154597
he said something like that,0.07667339
and michael curtis was like you know what we just got to get it,0.075331934
we got to get it grab it,0.09940859
and we'll move on to the other stuff,0.07717848
so i just thought that was interesting a little interesting fun fact to note,0.05459418
yeah but now everyone is fleeing from paris gosh the just i could just imagine like the chaos and the pandemonium but then also there's that aspect of like there's a sadness like you're leaving some people had to leave you know their homes and the place where they grew up for a land that they a foreign land to them,0.094264805
so it's just like,0.058902282
i said i think in the last in the last video these films really give you insight into kind of how life was lived during the time and there's just there's a there's a sadness that i feel for these people that were uprooted out of their lives because of this war like it's it's just,0.1856169
it's really sad,0.06680286
it says richard i cannot go with you or ever see you again,0.19387938
you must not ask why just believe that i love you go my darling and god bless you ilsa,0.16396777
oh so she left him,0.10290537
she was acting real shady in the last scene and that's what broke his heart,0.16561164
i wonder if that's where his cynicism comes from because he doesn't seem very cynical in this flashback,0.50989926
he seems like a sentimentalist,0.31502315
so this must have made him cynical and there she is oh no this spells trouble,0.3519862
oh god i feel bad for both of them it kind of has elements of brief encounter where they weren't trying to fall in love,0.11973883
they were just two people who happened to meet,0.15309282
in paris who fell in love and yeah and that sucks sometimes life just sucks,0.8606264
can i tell you a story,0.06736177
it's about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in oslo,0.31089434
she met a man about whom she had heard her whole life everything she knew or whatever became was because of him but the feeling she supposed was love,0.17270233
she's not talking about rick,0.2906332
i think she's talking about victor when she was talking about meeting,0.110819474
a man after coming from oslo,0.2413493
oh tell me who was it you left me for was it laszlo or were there others in between,0.14909741
aren't you,0.13259394
the kind to tell wow he's just talking out of anger and and pain don't let it get to you,0.24159256
or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow on one condition,0.21584705
you know the leader of the underground movement in paris in prague you'll furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your visa in the morning laszlo is literally telling this this um heinrich that like yeah i'm i'm the leader of the like he they all,0.17911667
know that he's a leader of the resistance and but there's no like guns being drawn,0.24103762
there's no you know no violent things happening,0.11928105
and it's just interesting to see the production code,0.04827267
and and the role that it plays in this in the storytelling because i feel like if this was a film that were to come out in 2021 or you know in the 2000s there would be a lot more violence there'd be a lot more like struggle,0.1483367
because like i said i was watching and i'm like why isn't why isn't heinrich like doing anything like physically like,0.12925759
why,0.05168617
isn't,0.045089502
he like you know like shooting guns or like you know holding him down or restraining him or or on the flip side like why,0.30627
why does everyone know the um laszlo secret like wouldn't that be more secretive,0.15198328
but no and i i suspect,0.109151036
it's because of the production code,0.057015933
so it's just interesting to see its influence did you run out on me because you couldn't take it,0.17415498
because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time no you say victor lasler is my husband and was even when i knew you in paris oh oh my god so she was married when they were in love in paris what also doesn't that violate the haze code because oh i guess it doesn't because she because she thought that her husband was dead have you heard about senior gotti in the letters of transit yes something those letters were not found in a guardian when they arrested him you know where they are not for sure i'll venture to guess that a god he left those letters with messier,0.14423229
oh so now they know that rick has the papers,0.08177009
oh that's lovely god,0.06972813
i love the boldness of lazlo,0.14974909
he's so bold and i absolutely love him,0.35795733
i love his character,0.046453472
i really love him and everyone stands out to sing the french,0.1705016
the french national anthem,0.14472507
i have goosebumps that's awesome more than anything,0.14508326
now i need rick to give him the transit papers,0.046615105
yes but no intention of selling them,0.06814724
when i was in a concentration camp where you lonely in paris he knows he has to know,0.1717091
why would he ask that and she's there how did she get in there all right,0.07325534
oh she has a gun pointed at him,0.36218923
no i want those letters go ahead and shoot he'll be doing me a favor,0.82190806
she's not gonna shoot you,0.8354827
she loves you their their romance and their chemistry is very you,0.15166986
can you can tell that,0.055032607
there's a lot of chemistry between their characters,0.080147386
but i also read that behind the scenes they weren't as romantic with each other but it's just it's interesting because their chemistry is so good i knew it it's romantic,0.08667581
so that scene was only allowed because of an editing difference because of the dissolve that we just saw they used a dissolve instead of a fade out because at the time a fade out suggested that two people were taking things a step further if you know what i mean if you're catching my wind,0.097276725
so instead of a fade out they decided to do a dissolve into the next scene,0.18435666
and so that's why this scene or this storyline was like or this scene alone was allowed,0.095975585
why weren't you honest with me,0.13629092
why did you keep your marriage,0.15148278
a secret,0.060734782
it wasn't my secret,0.102271006
richard victor wanted it that way what about now,0.06889446
now i don't know i know that i'll never have the strength to leave you again,0.31089434
so she's planning on staying with him in casablanca,0.24126108
and that makes sense because when she was trying to explain it to him that night,0.104357526
when he was drunk,0.24058579
she was saying that she mistook her uh fascination with with laszlo's work as love,0.32925072
she just really loved what he was about,0.13560994
and so she thought that that was love,0.103701256
and so that's why she married him,0.10691264
then she finds out that she's actually in love with rick and everything kind of comes crashing down when they're trying to escape,0.15906946
and then she realizes that laszlo is still alive like that is that is good storytelling,0.19291207
wow i know a good deal more about you than you suspect,0.31865826
i know for instance that you're in love with a woman,0.1950335
it's perhaps a strange circumstance,0.0917507
we both should be in love with the same woman,0.2201987
the first evening,0.046763133
