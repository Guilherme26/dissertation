[Music] hey guys so I'm gonna do something different for my channel I am going to do some movie reviews now that's pretty common for most people to do me not so much I'm not very good at movie reviews but I want to try my hand at movie reviews picked up this copy of 101 horror movies to see before you die by Stephen Jay Schneider so it's a pretty big book here of 101 horror movies to see before you die and it does movies by decades beginning in the 1910s it goes 1910s 20s 30s 40s all the way up to present time and I was looking through the book and I'm like wow there's a lot of movies I haven't seen that I probably should see you know some that I probably won't watch but for the most part I'm gonna watch all the movies in here and I want to try to do movie reviews watch this quick opening scene from the movie what movie god I can't even remember what movie I'm reviewing the cabinet of dr. Caligari Caligari it's from Germany so I'm gonna butcher all the names but watch this opening scene boom [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so the cabinet is directed by robert wiene produced by rudolf mine art and Eric Palmer probably like I said but during those names it was released in 1920 and Germany a quick plot synopsis for you a guy named Francis is sitting on a bench like you just saw talking to another man about how the spirits have driven him away from his home and as he is talking you saw the woman she like appears to be in a trance kinda like a zombie she walks by then he begins telling the old man next to him about his story so it's basically a flash back up point of view so Francis and his friend Alan have plans to go to the fair and dr. Caligari is trying to get a permit from the town clerk to present his it's like a long word for a sleepwalker that I can't pronounce it starts with an S I don't know we'll just call the sleepwalker I don't know his name is Caesar so the clerk makes fun of him or whatever buddy and ends up giving him the permit later the clerk is found stabbed to death the next day Francis is ill and decided to go to the fair to see dr. Caligari and Caesar so I guess one of the things about Caesar is you know he's a sleepwalker but he can actually like tell the future or whatever so Ellen asked him how long he has to live and Caesar tells him until dawn and what do you know Ellen ends up stabbed to death just like the clerk so Francis is all upset devastated and decides to investigate with the help of his friend Jane and her father so Caesar ends up kidnapping Jane I'm like giving you the rush through story so Jane gets kidnapped and gets followed by an angry mob from the town which makes him decide to just you know drop her and leave her he randomly collapses and dies so during all of the confusion dr. Caligari escapes and francis follows him and watches him enter the entrance into the entrance of an insane asylum he finds out that dr. Caligari is the director of the insane asylum and with the help of a staff he studies up on their records reads the guy's diary and while he's sleeping so it turns out that the doctor is obsessed with 28th century story of man who used a sleepwalker named Caesar to commit murders in Italian towns the director he experiments on a guy in the asylum who becomes his version of Caesar so they call the police and he becomes an inmate of his own asylum then we return to prison time and we find out that not everything is as it seems and that Francis's story is not what it appears to be one thing I really loved about this movie is the the background so the effects the cinematography it's actually you know it's a super old movie sorry I'm all like this super old movie but like the backgrounds were weird and creepy lines jagged edges the buildings buildings on the streets were like just jagged edges with narrow windy paths super dark and creepy it almost reminded me of an old old Tim Burton movie in some kind of way it made it super creepy I really liked it because it was so old it's kind of hard to follow the movie to follow the plot basically because it's a silent movie so eh they don't speak be you occasionally get a shot of it'll be like a caption so you read what they're saying or whatever and because they can't speak of course silent movie actors had to exaggerate their words their acting which I love about old movies I really do also I love the music because you know again no words so they use Jacobs over here falling asleep you probably are too sorry not sorry the music plays a big role in setting the tone of the movie so if something exciting happens you get loud music if something scary happens you get creepy music they had to pick music to match the mood of the situation in the and I love that I really do like I said I did have a hard time following the movie completely but the story of the movie is fantastic it's super unique creepy really creepy actually I mean honestly I'd never heard of that movie till I open this book so I would totally watch a remake of that movie and I think you guys would love it too you might even love the original I actually do recommend this have you seen this movie what did you think do you like it you think it was creepy what did you think of the buildings pretty cool huh are there any movies from the 1910s that you loved I'm curious because I still have a few more from that decade to watch so look forward to doing those reviews watch him wait for them just pop up on my channel because they'll be there soon thanks for watching everyone leave a comment down below hit like hit subscribe and give me a shout thanks for watching I love you guys have a great day bye adios
