[Applause] it is time to talk about a big one it's the latest installment in,0.026672535
the DCE you wonder woman this one's a pretty big deal for the Studio One,0.062689565
because Batman or Superman and Suicide Squad didn't exactly live up to expectations and then,0.14298788
too because it is a thousand time we get a female at superhero movie that,0.07076556
being said I was really hoping director patty Jenkins would just completely knock it out,0.09904917
of the park with this one it isn't perfect Wonder Woman is still a fantastic,0.04142298
film for a number of reasons the movie takes place way before the events of,0.02555835
Batman for Superman during World War one Diana is living a fairly quiet life hidden,0.084502935
away on the island of samos Karen until Steve Trevor's plane crashes in that area,0.11802752
after hearing about the war and all the evil taking place in the world beyond,0.14842641
that mascara from Steve Diana decides it is time to leave home and do what,0.039340958
she can to save the world alright so let's kick things off with some things,0.27424055
that work really well and there's really no better place to start than with gal,0.046167735
gadot performance the times of doubting her acting chops are over she is just so,0.03970082
great and perfectly cast as Wonder Woman she sold strong and confident and bbs and,0.050482783
now here we go back to a time when Diana is first learning what she's,0.024789399
capable of and what the world is like and the dot does a great job,0.027642371
playing in that range you believer is a fish out of water and the same,0.03292127
is true when she's a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield another great,0.07403494
bit of casting it's Chris Pine brass is because he became a familiar name via,0.026245486
a big franchise with 2009 Star Trek but this guy really deserves even more credit,0.06043925
than he gets he is just one heck of an actor who always brings more,0.16416533
to the roles he gets than what's on the page originally and Wonder Woman is,0.025732629
no different not only does he have great chemistry with gadot but he also has,0.027970307
great chemistry with everyone around him and for particular supporting characters that's the main reason,0.013774623
they make an impression Samus Kara is also a big highlight of the film it,0.022700056
is just so refreshing to see some frightful visuals and some really strong and majestic,0.03307426
female heroes particularly Robin Wright the lifestyle and history of Emma Skye are also super,0.033584457
interesting and appealing and it's the location of one of the best fight sequences in,0.0423416
the entire film only downside to all this is that I wish more of wonder,0.028144585
women to play here but there's still some funds we had beyond the mascara because,0.09665052
another big win and Wonder Woman is the humor it speaks to give a performance,0.05108477
her chemistry with pine the two of them just really play off each other so,0.08399274
so well when it comes to all those jokes about Stan and not understanding the,0.016759967
basics of human life and life in London that quality of Diana also comes into,0.09900926
play in a really interesting way with war she basically processes everything as good versus,0.09965582
bad if innocence are in need of help you help them it's as simple as,0.04339658
that and it is a really inspiring and refreshing thought process that we don't get,0.028047469
to see too often it's a really powerful component of the film alright so before,0.022986086
moving over to the negatives I think it is important to reiterate a movie can,0.060611535
have fuzz and still be great so that being said want to Wonder Woman's flaws,0.08371602
is pacing particularly in the second half it's long and it does start to feel,0.0394873
like it after we leave some mascara the color palette is a little bit dark,0.12816826
and dreary and some of the quieter conversation driven moments aren't really as engrossing as,0.028491145
they need to be and it's tough to talk villain without getting into spoilers but,0.020488322
I will say that while Wonder Woman has an excellent concept for the villainy featured,0.09657735
in the film just isn't executed as well as we could have been but again,0.04822781
flaws aside this is the movie we needed Wonder Woman is getting a three and,0.051894967
a half on the Dewey Decimal scale because it's got a fantastic lead performance an,0.060487144
ensemble that has so much chemistry and perhaps more important than anything because Wonder Woman,0.063819714
is oozing with heart and positivity you get to root so hard to leave for,0.035245422
the Niro you get to feel inspired and then you get to leave with a,0.036610376
whole lot of hope for what's to come in the DC EU I can't wait,0.074006334
to see what the studio's do with this character moving forward and I can't wait,0.013199904
