I'm not gonna lie it was really hard to get myself to watch Romo i,0.08028833
sat down right after it came out on Netflix to try and watch it for,0.07071701
lunch and I finished my lunch before the credits ended the credits are very slow,0.035326574
without much reward so I was like this is taking too long it's a it's,0.04246599
a little bit too slow of a burn I'd say for the first half of,0.25357178
the movie the final thing that really got me to check it out though was,0.022806486
it's you know it's it's a warrants situation that it's just winning award after award,0.019427354
after award it has momentum and I imagine more and more people would be like,0.024676982
okay I gotta watch it right or maybe you'll be just on the edge like,0.050456174
I was and Here I am to give you that last push to tell you,0.03630772
that you should indeed watch it but it's gonna be tough you know you got,0.026272094
to know that going in because even once I started Romo it was hard to,0.045836475
finish it I took in fact several breaks but did the movies credit I did,0.036809266
watch it in a single day because the story did hook me and you know,0.048231136
what it wasn't even so much the story as I wanted to see what korone,0.037429217
was doing he's he's all over this and in more ways than just the usual,0.034882896
you know being the director in the filmmakers situations you're about to find out but,0.023487635
you know he seemed in control even if I felt I didn't love what he,0.032949205
was doing so out of respect for him as an artist I was like well,0.09268935
let me see what you've got and I also wanted to see more of his,0.02809004
outstanding black-and-white cinematography cinematography made all the more impressive because quarren has never shot a,0.067826115
movie before he's a double in the cinematography before but Wow clearly you know just,0.055379864
being around such wonderful cinematographers throughout his career has really rubbed off on the guy,0.05929713
so good it's so good cinematography is amazing and on that note Rolla is an,0.03358379
intensely personal film for korone so much so that I would wager that watching Roma,0.06288314
is only half of the experience that he's put together here you need to know,0.034886222
her owns personal story behind the film the extraordinary almost unbelievable efforts that he went,0.01597505
through to recreate his childhood how and why he chose his cast especially his lead,0.14565726
actress and on top of all that the history of Mexico at the time not,0.08011738
just politically but also economically as well as race relations and I can imagine Alfonso,0.1787435
Cuaron talking to awards voters and explaining all of that what an awards campaign I,0.031020839
imagine it is captivating because I had a great time reading about it during the,0.023233535
movie and afterwards because I was like because I was like how is this autobiographical,0.04233162
I'd heard I'd heard a little bit about that you know the movie just wasn't,0.03525673
answering these questions for me so I had to go and find out although korone,0.046214297
has all my movies do during awards season is going to Awards voters and has,0.013979499
I am sure an amazing presentation and that's why it's doing so well during awards,0.020581447
season a lot of awards of voters know stuff that you do not and most,0.06101131
people who watch this movie will not know but I'm going to fix that for,0.053995617
you I have links down below to two articles that I feel do the trick,0.07908368
and you can either read them before or after you watch the movie it's up,0.026720427
to you what kind of experience you want to have I highly recommend you read,0.08654372
them before you watch the movie I think you'll have a much better time and,0.079463504
be able to get through it in one sitting perhaps even enthusiastically so but either,0.020643309
way again this is more of a package situation than just a movie now I,0.020725127
personally feel that a film should stand on its own and I do think the,0.037752498
core own could have done a better job hinting at the bigger picture in the,0.019859724
film in itself I don't think it needs to have all this additional reading material,0.040907465
I think that you know lots of historical films have been able to allude to,0.023279432
the bigger picture within the context of the film I think his strokes and Roma,0.015965737
are too broad perhaps because he's too close to the material it actually happened to,0.03244766
him and his loved ones so he automatically knows what he's looking at and also,0.035033226
he can fill in the blanks whereas we who have no attachment to this material,0.054515127
cannot do that this is why filmmaking is supposed to be a team effort so,0.0083567025
somebody can catch these things and be like quarrel and you're too close to the,0.035587326
material no one else is going to get this and it's why producers never do,0.023168346
directors any favors is interesting to have this conversation after talking about M night Shyamalan,0.090836145
on movie math yesterday uh you know producers don't do their directors any favors by,0.05347478
giving them total creative freedom that said though role is still hasn't awful lot going,0.035470918
for it and you know what I wasn't being like what else is going on,0.03689707
your Corona and furiously researching the movie you know during breaks I did appreciate it,0.0818402
from the perspective of what I do know going into the film and that's the,0.018333126
history of cinema and the feminist movement now on that first point the history of,0.045461312
cinema it is brilliant and impressive both from a creative perspective and a business standpoint,0.012164214
I mean it's so savvy when it comes to awards season I can't believe it,0.026160343
but korone has mimicked very very well French New Wave cinema and famous Italian black-and-white,0.00418334
films like Federico Fellini's eighth-and-a-half again it's all down to the black and white cinematography,0.03462813
absolutely stunning in fact I'm still thinking about it that's what stuck with me the,0.065465376
most about the movie 1960s Mexico depicted so sharply so cleanly and so vibrant Lee,0.022771232
that it just seems so alive I would also say on a side note that,0.043231614
I thought that cuar√≥n had an interesting directing style and it was a little absurdist,0.13034141
as well which I think not only you know points to these two these uh,0.065863825
you know movements in film French New Wave cinema and Italian black-and-white cinema but there,0.00015857145
is a tad voice Anderson in there too some like just really you know ironic,0.035657834
moments that really just got you you know I don't want to give any of,0.019132677
them away but that either also kind of kept me hooked and there were more,0.032260742
of those as the film went along but also movies even factored in to Roma's,0.016904978
story itself as the characters go to the movies frequently although a lot of times,0.015049115
not to actually watch the movie and in doing so they showcase some of the,0.036952946
truly beautiful movie houses that were the norm in the mid twentieth century there's one,0.017543554
in particular with the way the light from the projector lights up this movie theater,0.046662632
and there and you know there are characters that were with her in the back,0.016159972
so you can see the whole thing it's just gorgeous I loved it so much,0.048547097
and there's even a clip in the film from the 1960 movie maroon which the,0.028270304
characters go to see which instantly brought him up bring Stu mind when I was,0.04580854
watching it Coronas gravity and sure enough again I took a break I was like,0.033378914
why is this in here let me go look this is one of the problems,0.047573935
just watching movie on Netflix cuz you can do this you know you can't do,0.029917965
it in a theater although again as I said it did add to my enjoyment,0.035229456
of the film this is almost reviewed like a pop up movie where you can,0.017447101
go click on stuff while you're watching it because sure enough it turns out the,0.09972633
marooned was one of her own childhood favorite films that actually inspired him to make,0.09154523
the 2013 oscar-winning movie and interestingly marooned won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects back,0.03878686
in 1969 as did gravity so many years later but chrome didn't just include marooned,0.0670698
as an homage but also in the movie in roma we see two separate children,0.048128698
at separate times one middle-class on one very poor and that's reflected in their environments,0.052834205
and their astronaut costumes you know adrift and I think that that's a metaphor for,0.08172912
how it drifted along we all feel so often in life and how it means,0.039630312
so much when someone finally another human who is able to make connection with us,0.12242971
in the vast blackness darkness I think that you know the cold darkness of space,0.27882895
or also you could argue life so I liked that element the film also touches,0.03453168
on how fate decides so much for us just by birth such as race and,0.14558741
economic status and how especially in the late 1960s all over the world but here,0.020086551
in Mexico that those elements define one's life and inescapable ways as for the feminism,0.08533774
bit the ending of this film reminded me an awful lot of the ending of,0.056530632
big little lies even down to the beach and it's interesting to see Hollywood transition,0.11564417
from these stories of female survival to ones of female empowerment equally important and I'd,0.076798774
also like to point out that this fiercely feminist film is written and directed by,0.075613424
a man proving that gender lines or any lines really should not be drawn too,0.08512156
harshly in Hollywood as it continues as over to diversify Hollywood continues to diversify in,0.03249289
front of him behind the camera and the stories that it's telling what I mean,0.041158903
by that as I think it would be dangerous to start saying who can tell,0.06918708
what stories I think what's important is just to get the stories out there as,0.014825613
long as there's diversity in other films and in other ways I don't think that,0.030445455
we want to you know divide ourselves up all right because you have been denied,0.09977222
this film now also I wonder how people react will react to the fact that,0.029730383
it does not seem to start out as a feminist film whatsoever but sure turns,0.21364436
into one all right finally do I think that we Roman deserves all the awards,0.094870485
that it's getting I think it deserves to be nominated for sure and the more,0.03352792
I think about the more I think about Roma and the more I explore it,0.029681824
both actually research researching it and just you know again mulling it over the more,0.051591642
it does impress me but again I personally feel that a film should stand on,0.034964047
its own and korone is way too close to the material roma is an impressive,0.022106048
intriguing film but it's not perfect film and in fact it has many many flaws,0.0491451
obviously so still if you read the articles I've put down below in the video,0.19960564
description I do believe that it is worth your time especially since for most of,0.01928434
you you can watch it for free as part of your Netflix subscription I see,0.022941519
just a lazy afternoon that's when I started it as the perfect time and you,0.11372512
should just force yourself to keep watching trust me it's gonna pick up it's gonna,0.4035626
and again if you read these articles I think you'll enjoy it more and by,0.030015081
the end I think that you will agree that it was time well spent especially,0.03020333
if you're cinephile or if you're interested in any of the elements that I mentioned,0.20652555
here so that's my review of Roma I'm curious to hear your own thoughts down,0.05438741
below have you seen it if not why not what's it gonna take to get,0.01762138
you to watch it and also it please no spoilers and the second half of,0.06811281
the movie in particular there are some very good surprises and that does a lot,0.015744232
to help to help the second act so don't ruin that for anyone they're gonna,0.04154338
need it if they're gonna get through the movie alright so again that's my review,0.049909394
of share those thoughts down below and of course as always you can check out,0.0371984
