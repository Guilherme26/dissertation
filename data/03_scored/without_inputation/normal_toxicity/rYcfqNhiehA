my name's Tim you catch and ladybirds two beautiful directorial debut of crater gerweck all kind of because she actually co-directed a film nights and weekends exactly ten years ago which no one seems to mention any more,0.15463607
but since Lady Bird has her a movie and her movie alone I guess that's okay,0.17040312
she wrote the script and also directed it and it's one of the liveliest most charming first directed movies out there admittedly the high point was almost overwhelming,0.04647812
and I wish they could have seen it completely fresh,0.03442826
it didn't blow me away but I can't deny that I had a wonderful time with Kerouac's nostalgic and yet fresh take,0.10244783
on the coming-of-age formula Lady Bird has many autobiographical touches and don't go excess that she was a very different teenager from the one depicted on screen the film takes place from 22 to 23 when she herself like the girl in the movie graduated from st.,0.0950662
Francis,0.030291568
Catholic High School in her hometown of Sacramento,0.21039048
it's a comedic drama that covers this very important transition phase in a girl's young life and it would describe it as the age of seventeen meets rushmore quirky and light and yet very authentic and down-to-earth,0.15075709
the TAT Lady Bird refers to Saoirse Ronan character whose real name is actually Christine but she wants to be called Lady Bird instead she's a high school senior from as she describes it the wrong side of the tracks her family is on the poorer side,0.15931533
and her father is struggling to find a new job Lady Bird is a little rebellious at least the way you think you are when you are 17 and she longs for adventure and sophistication like most teenagers or human beings in general she thinks she is destined for better cooler things and she can't really wait to get out of Sacramento to go to big places like New York the movie moves at a very nice pace,0.11519466
always coming up with great little scenes,0.09857033
and it's awakening those a very important last month of school in short and yet wonderful 90 minutes of screen time great agaric seems to have a natural talent for filmmaking,0.098358005
and it's simply a joy to watch Lady Bird unfold in front of your eyes going in I already have heard how great Saoirse Ronan is and it's true but I didn't know about Laurie Metcalf as her mother Marion,0.4033149
and the funny thing is that a sort of film at a press screening the morning of the Oscar nominees and announcement and seeing her on the list for the best supporting actress made me really happy,0.0727579
I've known her ever since Roseanne and she's incredible as Christine's loving mother who has to deal with her daughter growing up and wanting to go far away their relationship is one of the best and deepest mother/daughter relationships and films and the polar opposite from the one in I Tanya which was the other standout last year or this year depending on when you've seen the movies but even though we start with Lady Bird and her mother in the car,0.07909383
it's not so clear at the beginning that their relationship,0.086096756
will turn out to be the emotional core of the film because Lady Bird beautifully shifts between different characters and surroundings the theater class at school hanging out at a friend's place going to the supermarket where her brother and her brother's girlfriend work,0.09523099
and so on Lady Bird is filled with good characters and wonderful performances and Lucas,0.0867717
hatches might have one of the best agents in Hollywood that guy just keeps popping up in great movies from the grand Budapest hotel to Manchester by the sea and now three billboards outside of Missouri as well as Lady Bird he placed the romantic interest and the film succeeds in giving you that special magic that you feel with first laughs we're not drifting away too much into quirkiness Timothy Gemma man also has a small role,0.124715015
and in both call me by your name for which he got nominated as Best Actor in a leading role and Lady Bird,0.12570369
he plays a young guy who comes too soon Lady Bird is a warm and heartfelt movie and it got so much praise that I'm afraid I can't really add that much to the conversation right,0.16913053
now I don't think it brings something groundbreaking to the coming-of-age drama but it is told in such a lovely fashion that it's almost impossible to leave the theatre with anything,0.091389604
but joy in your heart and it's emotional core and the great characters helped a lot to make it more than just a light-hearted,0.060133606
a feel-good movie in German,0.32632488
