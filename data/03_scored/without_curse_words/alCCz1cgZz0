all the way across the board the performances are mesmerizing and why I say they're,0.06721033
mesmerizing is just how what I love about these films from the 70s is that,0.09459019
these movies are so free from vanity or star type of acting like it's really,0.19173281
just actors up there living and breathing the characters these are real people James Caan,0.25504526
is Sonny Al Pacino is Michael Marlon Brando is the Godfather you know what I,0.09266332
mean they are these people in this movie when tired Shire is giving into it,0.1699156
with her with her abusive husband that woman is losing her mind for real that,0.5182741
ain't no acting that is the real deal in this petition like I will say,0.099338554
when I get into the business professionally and I become a fully working professional actor,0.07691068
and do films this is the type of level I'm talking about like I'm talking,0.120470606
about getting up there living it for real in front of the camera I ain't,0.0863625
talking about no you know I'm gonna hey I'm gonna come to the store see,0.15642944
you later type of acting no or no or Bill Russell Miami by season 2,0.19638266
style acting when you say the words on the paper no no I'm talking about,0.11205547
living and breathing the characters in that moment where I'm feeling it we're in it,0.076615185
we are in the moment great great great stuff there's there's so many anything is,0.0444258
I had never seen the film but now I see where all the movies all,0.049926907
the gangster movies have stolen from this film you know that the famous quote I'm,0.35343805
gonna give him an offer I can't refuse in a you know Marlon Brando would,0.14324066
you come to me come for now one thing I will say about Marlon Brando,0.33018962
when I was in acting classes back in the beginning of my college career one,0.05266917
of my acting teachers moves like a Broadway guy from New York kind of thing,0.115581155
um his opinion of marlon brando was not the greatest because he was an actor,0.22997734
or stage actor he didn't feel Marlon Brando was as exceptional as everybody else thought,0.12295503
he would he also had a couple knocks on Kevin Costner where he said he,0.11155163
did they Kevin customer was a good actor I'm not getting it all that but,0.068026796
I'm just giving you guys opinions of like people who are tourists stage actors versus,0.15106566
you know people who are like actually stars character actors or whatever you get different,0.09291875
opinions I also remember digressive also back I think was 2002 or 2001 a filmed,0.059092678
Antwone Fisher in Cleveland I went up for extra work on that movie I never,0.10196232
got a call back which is fine 19 to 20 men but either way I,0.111741506
knew a woman who worked on that movie and she was an actress local stage,0.15480424
actress in the Cleveland area and I know that she had some scene - Denzel,0.13043517
all I know is direct quote from her life this ain't me this is her,0.15264164
she said well we was just making him look good take it as you may,0.14927354
I don't know if that's being bitter or whatever that's what the person said so,0.1510359
you have different opinions upon you know people who are stage actors and how they,0.113544054
feel about movie stars and their acting hey look my opinion is somebody who loves,0.07955458
to act and loves to perform and loves films I can only go off how,0.1504725
I feel and what I see and what I get from the actual performer you,0.08407017
know I would be a part of all this you know this person is bad,0.52993375
and that person is bad although we all have our opinions but whatever but anyway,0.2424786
back to the Godfather this does exist the kind of acting you see in this,0.100946255
movie you just you just don't see anymore you just go it's just pretty much,0.1619801
non-existent unless you watch like some movie some independent David Lynch movie streamed on online,0.109585516
or something like that that's the only time you get to see this kind of,0.103127815
acting the cinematography and this thing also stolen years later with that very kind of,0.17714962
I saw the net that Joaquin Phoenix movie we own the night words it's very,0.053785466
kind of muted kind of brown kind of tones and kind of a brown kind,0.3473601
of look she almost and hit my car because I asked him know how to,0.34740236
drive hi sorry oh um but he's very muted kind of brown kind of colors,0.46736926
or gritty kind of look you also saw that movie the yard with Mark Wahlberg,0.10275278
walking for you to remember I think it's the same director but I really love,0.055839807
the cinematography but I and I see how all the gangster kind of movies have,0.28198147
stolen from this movie and of course again I love how the camera scenes take,0.31089434
their time that's the difference with the 70s movies the scenes take the time with,0.04715286
the when the camera sits there you feel like you're in the room with them,0.12340337
observing real people it's not like now we're like cut cut to close-up angle you,0.46217138
know there's a little bit of that in there but it doesn't feel so choppy,0.092457786
it doesn't feel like the movie is forcing you to pay attention to certain things,0.07138062
that they want you to see the movie really just feels like it's sitting there,0.078297846
in the room and you as the viewer make the choice of who your eyes,0.14298664
who you're going to look at you might be looking at everybody your eyes could,0.13289274
be drawn to certain people in the room 70s movies give you the option of,0.09700364
picking who you're going to observe in this room of people while you're watching observing,0.11075516
what's happening in front of you are they just on beneath and scenes take they,0.15268701
take their time they say no rush we don't have to be rushed we take,0.09250229
our time take our time now yes all these movies this the deer hunter taxi,0.096790574
driver tons of movies from this air that are very very long I think the,0.070687056
big difference being is just everything that I just stated with an observer real life,0.12455398
does not go as quickly as we want it to when we apply for that,0.07861463
branding job you'll get that callback when we want to it could be six or,0.10746404
seven it could be months before we get a callback it could be months before,0.07151589
we get approved for our house whatever this is real time that's how it goes,0.05267644
you know it's not like this new filmmaking where hey I applied for a job,0.12852877
and I get the job tomorrow no no no this is happening I'm with them,0.08025826
as this happens when I went out I'm with Al Pacino over in Sicily and,0.09149592
I'm just observing all of this and I do love that scene where his wife,0.2503262
in Sicily just gets blown up that was the funniest thing where I love how,0.24042265
he's like he's like hey man what you doing I thought she's supposed to be,0.20214383
helping out my wife in the car he's like where you going this guy back,0.3336153
I mean my man took off in the car was like boom that was the,0.11167785
best I love that see it was the best it never has a firebombing been,0.23772104
so funny in the movie I'm sorry I loved that scene but this is just,0.083654314
great now um a criticism criticism I Marlon Brando okay I understand that this is,0.08775741
an iconic performance I get that and I do get a little butthurt when people,0.43989655
talk about movies that I grew up with and I love I did not grow,0.058565762
up with The Godfather this film came out way before I was born but I,0.056777544
knew of it my entire life Marlon Brando's performance to me is slightly excuse me,0.16759379
slightly hammy slightly slightly I'm not knocking it but it only seems to get hammy,0.11659878
when he kind of I think there's like a scene where like the guy who,0.17191471
is the singer is talking about how he can't get this role in the movie,0.06302096
and he wants them to do some pool for him so he could get him,0.15383542
a job in the movie and he goes like we're crying he kind of made,0.18345207
fun of them there those kind of moments where he kind of go over exerts,0.16467117
I kind of feel he's hammy but when he really just Marlon Brenda just chills,0.19324706
and acts he just goes like oh I think he's very good I really like,0.11862947
the scene oh that's his real life son but where he scares the kid with,0.16166785
the teeth before he has a heart attack I really like that team I really,0.2870686
like a lot of things between him and James Caan and I think there's the,0.112737834
one in particular that sets off the war between the different families but we're the,0.07891943
guys like Caleb wants you to get in on this drug trade with me and,0.43836808
you know Marlon Brando's like I'm going to no you do what you do I'm,0.34768817
not really feeling that James Collin kind of jumps in I really like that scene,0.1026549
I thought there was a really good dynamic of highlight the father is kind of,0.06855171
more like you chill you don't be disrespectful you know you don't let another man,0.24083105
know what you're thinking you just chill be like no I'm good you do what,0.15420185
you do I do what I do and James Caan is just kind of like,0.104310215
nah man I'm not feeling this dude at all but I like how you got,0.16247942
that little dynamic there you can really see that that character of James Caan Sonny,0.08946505
was like stolen from a lot of movies you know the you know the Joe,0.2417902
Pesci is old dog for menace to society jeremy renner in the town that style,0.37994674
character of the off the handle family of friend member has been just stolen a,0.26488578
million gangster movies but um this is just a great movie and I also love,0.27656916
how they show that the women in this world to quote John bender from The,0.5229126
Breakfast Club need to shut up and go fix me a turkey potpie stay in,0.5369882
your place you know it's crazy man I love out of the city the movie,0.49886918
with Diane Keaton and Al Pacino and one thing about Pacino in this movie is,0.07335875
he starts out just kind of like an observer of his family's activities but he'll,0.06994402
want no part of it and has he and as he grows in the family,0.07803549
and becomes you know become the new Godfather I love how you can see how,0.12317511
that infects him you know he's kind of more starry-eyed and naive at the beginning,0.49227828
of the movie and by the end he's just like the rest of them you,0.20217088
know and he's just as cold and calculating like the rest of them but you,0.2411093
have to be in this business but I love how when Diane Keaton comes to,0.052153926
him goes that's not true what you did to such and such my man looks,0.23366788
right in her face and lies and goes no and she goes I need you,0.605031
but the thing I love about the scene is that's the lie of when these,0.27263394
women are with men were part of organized crime they don't want to believe that,0.4033518
the person they love is the fly they don't want to believe that the person,0.1123044
they love is organized crime so he tells it which she wants to hear no,0.25603747
but they both knows BS fantastic scene thumbs up the video subscribe to the channel,0.11378951
