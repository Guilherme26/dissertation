of like ancestry and culture and kind of learning about that i know this movie,0.033055637
has such high praises so many people have said what an amazing movie this is,0.025606245
anyways that's really all i have to say about this i'm so excited to watch,0.065724134
so let's get into it oh i love this intro already i can already tell,0.08928228
this is going to be such a beautifully designed and animated movie the papa he,0.0436733
was a musician he and his family would sing and dance and one day he,0.032691114
left with his guitar and never returned they always gotta hit us with a sad,0.11013712
story in the beginning she didn't have time to cry over that walkway musician oh,0.028437266
okay after banishing all music from her life she found a way to provide for,0.12929441
her daughter oh you're a twig nico have some more no gracias i asked if,0.33333263

family apart until 1942 when he was crushed by come on what did the la,0.10435135
cruz always say seizure moment oh that's like his little mentor yeah i don't blame,0.042031623
him for being terrified to tell them that he likes music if that's how they,0.035339877

together look how beautiful that is coming home no mama it's okay oh this is,0.086509794
really cool because i don't know a lot about the day of the dead and,0.217535
what the traditions are so i think that this is really cool that disney did,0.027454125
a movie representing a different culture and different traditions this music is so beautiful i'm,0.05360449
gonna play mariachi plaza if it kills me nothing we've all decided it's time joined,0.26321316
us in the workshop i'm sure he'll be thrilled to do that carrying on the,0.059079617
family's tradition i also don't trust that dog underneath there i feel like he's gonna,0.12375077
mess something up oh my god i knew it he was so close i knew,0.0625266
it i'm gonna be a musician what is all this you keep secrets from your,0.117273204
own family it's all that i mean yeah you guys react very poorly to anything,0.08048656
regarding music you said my family would guide me well de la cruz is my,0.066456504
family he's got a point oh god is she gonna break his guitar or something,0.2879942

i oh is this his family yeah see i love that i hope he adopts,0.068884425
the dog at the end and he becomes part of the family i'm pretty sure,0.06830305
i saw something like that shot in the trailer and i thought it was so,0.26746956
cool looking look at all of that oh your photos are in your son have,0.04686219
a great listen yes what about the worker they don't get to see their family,0.052184988

i do if no one put up my photo i know that sounds so depressing,0.060843017
you starve from the dead but i wasn't stealing the guitar it was my great,0.49641934
great grandfather's yeah don't say that in front of her you know she's the reason,0.027314436
why the whole family hates music i give you my blessing to go home to,0.22041126
put my photo back on the ofrenda and to never play music again what she,0.042785943
can't do that here we go mariachi plus here i come two seconds and you,0.1186528

cruz he and i go way back i can get your front proceeds to his,0.058727734
sunrise spectacular show this is de la cruz no one's ever put up my picture,0.085402265
but you can change that this is okay so he's not de la cruz well,0.08662554
this is great because he needed a friend so now he has one one hiccup,0.17905879
the la cruz is a tough guy to get to and i need to cross,0.08988028
that bridge soon like yeah he definitely doesn't know de la cruz right he's just,0.25379944
lying about that hey you said you have real tickets that that was a lie,0.056936394
i apologize for that at least he's honest and feels remorse or maybe he only,0.039859135
feels remorse when he gets caught that's probably it actually and they go to drink,0.03339754
from the milk of their mother who is a cactus but also me and her,0.06945316
milk is not him this is quite an elaborate piece ernesto doesn't do rehearsals he's,0.077528484
too busy hosting the fancy party at the top of his tower i know where,0.06769108
we have to go i don't want to see your stupid face actor come on,0.62169373

bring back my van or my mini fridge oh just yeah he has a bad,0.1380123
track record you okay i'm fading it i can feel it oh cause no one,0.06443102
remembers him why am i getting emotional oh yeah i'm with the dog on this,0.097517915
one when there's no one left in the living world who remembers you you disappear,0.26447958
from this world oh that is so heartbreaking that was actually a question i had,0.027654344
in the beginning where it's like obviously families are honoring those in their family that,0.029437037
they love that have passed on but eventually if people stop having children in your,0.12197206
family everyone's gonna forget about you at some point if generations don't pass on these,0.04522384
stories and these people that's really sad is ernesto de la cruz going to be,0.08580603
really rude or not appreciative of miguel i don't know i'm just stressed about he,0.06737113
idolizes him so much when he actually meets him i feel like people are always,0.04656618
so disappointed when they meet their idols okay even the dog is disappointed i'm nervous,0.13298617
for him you got this let's go hector's great don't go crazy he's a natural,0.22318575
i love their friendship oh my gosh this is one of the most wholesome and,0.04753868
pure friendships i think i've seen in a movie in a very long time why,0.05109608
do you have to ruin everything run away from his family they just want to,0.12461883
send him back to the line of the living room you said that was your,0.10007156
only family the only person who could send you home i do have another family,0.04029749
i could have taken my photo back this whole time okay this friendship crumbled a,0.03960171
lot faster than i thought it would keep your dumb photos stay away from me,0.35766748
now music's the only thing that makes me happy it's very selfish of the family,0.07993312
to be like you can't like music because one person that was mean to us,0.0573681
and screwed us over was a musician if my family was like this oh my,0.2585074
gosh i would be the same way as miguel i wanted to put down roots,0.28752667
he wanted to play for the world what's more selfish than leaving your family to,0.17225063
go do pursue music do pursue to go pursue music is to then ban every,0.078733794
single other person in your family from liking listening to playing music all right the,0.046115186
moment of truth is coming i'm so nervous for him this is like jay gatsby's,0.04787992
parties this is a lot he really had it there are you all right nino,0.027644368
my boy with a talent like yours how could i not listen okay he seems,0.24258375

team but you died and i knew something was gonna go wrong he couldn't be,0.33430898
