alone and i was like so that's why she said he was dead because she,0.2543825
really didn't think he was because he was in the concentration camp of course i'd,0.046361305
be careful so he's probably gonna die tonight is she gonna go see rick i,0.43885192
would talk about a late night booty call richard i had to see it was,0.11700048
richard again we're back in paris he is so sheisty i love it fighting for,0.075036705
anything anymore except myself i'm the only cause i'm interested in that's what heartbreak will,0.06502037

get the the transit papers and then he's gonna leave elsa like and it just,0.02584305
all magically works out like that oh wait i forgot that laszlo doesn't know that,0.06661349
elsa's there if we stop breathing we'll die we stop fighting our enemies the world,0.43132922

with the same woman oh so he does know we use the letters to take,0.10563848
her away from casablanca do you love her that much yes i love her that,0.086237065
much wow i didn't expect that from laszlo you're not very subtle but you are,0.09788709
effective i i get the point i respect that you get something really big something,0.043354675
that would chuck them in a concentration camp for years quite a feather in your,0.32298487
cap wouldn't it oh would you really do that to him though but you were,0.058137715
never interested in anyone she isn't just any woman i see he was in love,0.10979189

that he's stealing his wife not so fast louie nobody's gonna be arrested not for,0.2919784
a while what i didn't see this coming under the circumstances i will sit down,0.06452082
good idea gun is pointed right at your heart that is my least vulnerable spot,0.22023499
i wasn't ready for this plot twist i had no idea airport huh this is,0.030684257
captain reynolds speaking there were two letters of trash and he called the german sheriff,0.3561287

way so they could go to america and continue to fight the good fight and,0.15650508
now rick's getting a little all inclusive vacation to lay under the radar for a,0.017094554
while to lay low and he gets to keep his bar sam stays employed carl,0.062381588
