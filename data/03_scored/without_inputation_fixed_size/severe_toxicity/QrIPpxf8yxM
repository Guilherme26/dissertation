silence your cell phones now sympathy marchers i'm very aware of that mr hoover what,0.10346001
i do know is he's non-violent what i need to know right now what's martin,0.09163769
luther king about to do next what's going on youtube welcome back to the movie,0.09674032
experience and yes i know i said that the movie experience uh is only on,0.032876037
the weekends we gotta catch up on the new movies every weekend but this time,0.034042105
it is a very historical day this is martin luther king jr holiday and today,0.0344013
we are going to review some of the martial kingdom movies and i'm doing one,0.098294854
of my favorite movies hands down uh i thought this is one of the best,0.061952543
uh interpretations of martin king jr story and that is selma summer is directed by,0.014356659
avery duvernay who is famously known for directing uh some of the great stuff like,0.03647069
we see a documentary netflix called 13 that was a a great documentary as well,0.031068068
i know she did a wrinkle in time and a lot of things people weren't,0.024347717
wearing today movie like that but uh someone when it first came out this is,0.04046445
this put every dude on the mat because it was between either her elite daniels,0.065888435
doing this movie and leave dance to at the time took note to do the,0.042905677
butler now don't get wrong i do enjoy the butler and i think i the,0.06601083
butler i will be reviewing for black history month as well but when it comes,0.2894734
to some i think ava junior was the perfect one to to capture this so,0.040259574
this is the story of martin king during 1965 during the uh when he's trying,0.022376113
to go for the voting rights uh act we get to vote right next in,0.020475017
1965 but we would go for uh african-americans right to vote down in selma alabama,0.41073716
so we're only taking place in this one section of water king side martin king,0.031826377
has a very hefty life obviously and one day i know people would like to,0.05609028
see a whole movie of a brainstem but there are some so many events in,0.07475267
martin king's life that weren't just a detailed one movie type thing for instance boycott,0.08629361
starring jeffrey white was the hbo when we got back in 2001 they had just,0.06326429
to focus on the montgomery bus boycott and i was thinking like one thing you,0.06629619
can do with it with monitor king if you can't make a full movie and,0.022195848
like because it's going to be a long movie i think it needs to be,0.049136452
like and kind of like an mcu kind of series and thing where different sections,0.0518504
of his events of his life that they can take a movie to focus on,0.05157302
that like the boycott uh birmingham and then you know nobel peace prize and then,0.11098323
selma to chicago vietnam like there's so many things you could do to stick it,0.06079978
all up in there i was wondering somebody may do that but uh this is,0.02265682
starring dave royello as the role of martin luther king and uh we making her,0.028189817
return to uh at the cinema because she played coretta scott king in uh boycott,0.113757044
she comes back to play correct scott king again as a karma eldrigo i know,0.06724807
i pronounced that her name wrong always do and this was a a movie written,0.122760974
by paul webb and also produced by oprah winfrey so let's get on into some,0.020293422
i'm gonna get into the good i'm gonna get to the bed and i'm gonna,0.41856265
get into well the sport this movie came out it's old right now and i,0.09220776
did not have a youtube channel around when this movie was out so i i,0.10258396
just it came out late 2014 went into movie theaters in january 2015 and then,0.014848894
my youtube channel didn't start until may of 2015 so i never got around to,0.031698663
reviewing it so now i get it going so now start off with the good,0.07856817
starting off david o'yellow and captures the spirit of martin luther king jr there have,0.043059997
been a lot of people that played dr martin luther king i like paul winfield,0.028730612
the ministers even though i think the ministers was terrible i do like uh jeffrey,0.0854608
white and boycott but he represents more than young king this uh the real world,0.16641432
represents a lot of the season martin luther king jr and i i enjoyed that,0.06911857
him and um what we just seen in my range black bottom uh coleman domingo,0.1286658
who plays ralph abernathy those two really capture the essence of martin king and rob,0.10520478
that nothing in their friendship everybody does a great job that because since i am,0.05630713
into this era history and i just study it she brings out characters and first,0.027115546
of all this was cast wonderfully everybody that plays the part of their characters looks,0.014250894
like their character would back in 1965. and a lot of times with these big,0.017848874
cell rice movies you get the big names you get the monster kings you get,0.27384242
the ralph albinos you get to andrew young's but there's a lot of people that,0.1392482
played a part in this that you do not necessarily get and she went out,0.024792725
and she is uh teaching the audience of all these other uh heroes in the,0.03678133
civil rights movement and young heroes and older heroes people that doesn't know about such,0.035607945
as common plays of the reverend james bevel who's not really mentioned in a lot,0.041341163
of movies but he's just documentaries a lot of people don't watch america sometimes they,0.08238366
think they're boring uh tessa thompson plays diane nash he does a great job as,0.08422489
dying nashes also they bring in at john lewis now john lewis obviously we know,0.08743839
about john lewis a lot of people know more more about the royal jungle especially,0.06940593
after this past year and of course you know a lot of people really love,0.026015997
know john those but they don't but they bring she brings john williams in here,0.048796542
hosea williams comes to my jimmy lee jackson played by the keith stanfield who did,0.03917998
a great job as well fred gray and all and all these other people even,0.13180748
uh james orange these are all sclc members that play an important part of what,0.19655246
happened down in some alabama and going on into that so i i like how,0.13489458
she takes time to introduce us to a lot of new characters also while still,0.047595885
putting the spotlight on on the main players but also putting the spotlight on number,0.057259675
two and show that they they had a significant role in this uh plot and,0.07103496
one thing i liked about the movie also is that it wasn't just okay this,0.03733809
this place is a problem we're going to march uh we're going to piss the,0.2647102
white folks off we're going to get our rights to vote and that's what that's,0.35341555
what's going to be no evidence humanizes these things because you got to understand that,0.098420575
in this time there's a lot going on and every time just like the whole,0.025992716
town is against you you are a mark in that town you coming in there,0.081905395
into their eyes to stir up trouble so you're already a marked man to be,0.14624062
dead she shows the uh the human side of martin king in this movie where,0.4061276
he's not a martyr he's not the saint that a lot of people put him,0.12369622
up to be and because you know he was nonviolent that that king has flaws,0.05918538
like every human being on this earth has flaws okay and you know some are,0.1001587
greater than others you know say and even even with him doing so much good,0.044508766
he had flaws and he he was scared a lot of times and it's going,0.059019748
into it we look like a history like wait they took care of their problem,0.06645517
to 68 but it king's eyes he was supposed to be dead that day so,0.14687455
she brings a lot of uh human aspects to it even when uh it comes,0.11783196
to the fbi and you know being under the letter to correct his house about,0.0735008
him cheating on her like that was a very tough scene that she did put,0.17582667
in the movie it was also the scene where malcolm x comes to selma and,0.016831808
then he didn't like michael mix coming to someone's turn of all the shuttle trouble,0.028778505
of all the good they have done down south because he was all up in,0.07768081
the north and they don't usually put that or talk about that when they talk,0.029435707
about selma when it comes to that kind of moves like that or even small,0.024982302
kind of documentary so those those things as somebody who watched me i appreciate that,0.038045842
i grabbed on today and i loved all of it and it wasn't that you,0.2142909
know black folks all unified at that time they showed that the slick didn't like,0.45997632
sclc coming down and getting up in their business they felt as though that they,0.15697803
they could do a job at an sclc but the people wanted scf martin kenny,0.18463303
come down that's why you know uh james farmer and john lewis it was clashing,0.068717465
his i like seeing it it it it shows you know reality everybody's not just,0.10076667
like because we're black we all go get we're going to get along and go,0.35501373
out there and do this that's the same thing what's going on in this country,0.044771515
right now just because everybody's black and you feel it was like okay well you,0.3679627
can actually different people with black lives matter means and you'll get 13 different answers,0.6378343
okay so there's always so many different ways to try to handle things but you,0.04868479
know they're going to be a difference of opinion and she put and she put,0.04190657
that in there and i think that was um that was really good uh tim,0.028010217
roth comes uh comes here as joe uh george wallace i think he did a,0.17678718
great job as that like he made me really hate him so that that that,0.20676103
was his uh his job in here and he got a lot of a lot,0.035099745
out of name after that you play smaller roles but they are bigger actors that,0.013561764
are playing a part oprah winfrey cooper good junior just named this name a few,0.014387922
so they were uh really really good in the movie now i could go i,0.072614774
really can go on all day about this movie what i would not now stop,0.07528017
and talk about how many days i like let's get into some of the things,0.07416066
about the bad that you know that probably you know could have been done better,0.024190068
so when it comes to the bed some of the things i like that there,0.092064746
was these slow motion shots that even do when they use to the point i,0.08900357
was just like i understand it's trying to capture the moment in the impact and,0.011963327
i think it just went on just a little bit too long i'm not i'm,0.12096431
afraid look i watch that sniper stuff okay so i i'm a fan of slow,0.3293637
motion stuff but there were times i was just like just uh pick it up,0.03763609
just a little bit it comes like just a little bit too long but you,0.1558645
know see it doesn't doesn't hurt the movie by no means at all and it's,0.02042912
a personal thing of mine it's just like um every time we do a period,0.052868795
piece movie where we talk about one certain thing we we get all the details,0.031928815
leading up to it but then when we get to the end like like the,0.025406688
victory march we kind of rushed through the end and i'm like i would have,0.11893483
liked to see you know whenever it makes it the end and then him he,0.06377714
said make it into the it did the march from summit to montgomery that he,0.049743764
did the speech at the montgomery capitol but i would like to them see the,0.04620831
voter you know have them signed and then johnson signed the voter rights act and,0.022693405
you know um how some of the people that came down there to help them,0.0443152
out i mean they did talk about a lot of people they know a lot,0.06261573
of the people that came down to help like james reid you know the white,0.30274022
uh pastor that came down who was killed so they do go in today and,0.29688653
like these are nitpicks of mine because of how into the history i am but,0.08901421
those certain things i probably couldn't you know enjoy enjoy a little bit more but,0.08379385
guys uh but then uh there really is no spoilers i'm gonna say if people,0.13467641
say this movie's about five years old and there's really no sports it's really going,0.020162381
by the history of it so there's really no experience of sports i'm not i'm,0.021404944
gonna cut that part out uh i'm just gonna tell you right now that you,0.23848112
i recommend you guys go out there and check out some i can really go,0.1004414
on and on about this all one day this is one of the best monitor,0.033779357
king movies they ever made i i really think that when it comes to his,0.035279345
life when it comes to a a period piece for each part of his life,0.1109054
as a movie that would be good like a whole kind of anthology type thing,0.08417766
using same actors i'm cool it kind of like an mcu type thing as opposed,0.053375002
to making one long movie because there are a lot of points that's going to,0.03030244
be left out everybody needs to be in there such as the michael makes movie,0.022074785
i love the malcolm x movie and uh like i said macabre is a little,0.03157161
bit more easier to do because of what happened in his life but there was,0.082760155
still portions of the michael mix movie that they left out and i'm just like,0.03156496
because it was already over in a three-hour territory i'm just like see it it,0.056129526
could have been done you know like that that whole one night in miami they,0.023751047
took that whole part out you know saying him and catches clay thing i was,0.025799148
i kind of want to see that but i'm telling you guys right now i'm,0.03755228
going to give selma a complete nerdgasm i recommend you guys go out there ron,0.40338218
king day check out some if you guys have not seen some already you're going,0.045767296
to see certain things check out boycott king was the mainstream that came out 1978,0.045068186
and me personally it's it's so badly written it really is paul winfield systems do,0.047089014
a great job but it's so badly written and the story's all over the place,0.032543443
especially for people who know the story i'm gonna say you can go watch if,0.040890835
you want to they they play it every year on tv one or bt or,0.018185455
so you go check it out but if you guys see some you guys into,0.036913037
