he goes to see lots of different people who are either at the scene of,0.040868882

have different accounts of what happened some people say a certain thing happens some people,0.028257666
say something else happens and it turns out that there might be a mysterious third,0.02944901
man who was involved in this crime and in fact we don't actually know whether,0.087935284
it was a murder or whether it was an accident or how many people were,0.2068801
involved or the circumstances and throughout this film we are following holly martin's as he,0.014266859
tries to discover the truth about what happens to harry lyme and how in fact,0.028739925
he died now we also get a supporting cast in this film um we get,0.0924725
trevor howard he plays a character called major callaway who is essentially trying to also,0.063769825
figure out what has happened to harry lyme and he believes that harry ryan was,0.03142926
involved in some suspicious activity himself which could have possibly led to his death and,0.23571211
we also get um alida valley who plays a character called anna schmidt who was,0.024096943
a woman who was at harry lam's funeral and he was very much in love,0.22830643
with harry line and then we also get this story developed this romance angle between,0.014024067
holly martens and anna schmidt as well although holly martens obviously really likes anna anna,0.11665924
still cannot stop thinking about harry and how much she misses him so this was,0.046267513
the first time i'd ever seen this film so going into it i didn't know,0.061061863
exactly what to expect i knew this film was very well regarded it's actually number,0.04515599
one on the british film institute's greatest british films of all time and it does,0.05699892
have a very british film to it although interestingly enough it's also listed on the,0.02361402
american foot um on the american film institute's list of 100 greatest american movies in,0.054745946
1998. really the only american links to it are that awesome wales is in it,0.022975443
and joseph cotton they're both american and also the producer was david o'sellsnick who was,0.052179664
american who produce many big hollywood films such as gone with the winds but really,0.03623455
the director carol reed is british and it does have a very british feel to,0.020379897
it so i quite like that and what i really like about this film is,0.024617117
the cinematography and in fact this film actually only won one oscar which was for,0.034322146
the cinematography because it's shot in gorgeous black and white and this this film is,0.02721998
filled with loads of fantastic lighting effects really dark shadows and some tilted camera angles,0.08694682
to give it a certain effect and it really is such a beautiful film to,0.021972347
look at this is one of the best looking black and white films i've ever,0.029560762
seen it's one of those films that i cannot picture it being in color because,0.07198484
if it was in color i really don't think it would work the right way,0.088692926
what is also great about this film is the setting so it was shot entirely,0.06658023
on location in vienna and remember this was 1949 so it was only a few,0.03694297
years after the end of world war ii and as such vienna looks a very,0.1135229
desolate place there's lots of places which have been bombed lots of buildings which look,0.27232608
very dilapidated and looks quite run down but when it's shot in this spectacular black,0.33929923
and white with all these lighting and dark shadows really gives it a mysterious effect,0.11261493
to it really adds to the tone of the film gives us a sense of,0.008932752
intrigue and mystery which i really appreciated another thing that i have to mention in,0.039021667
this film is the musical score so the score for this film was done by,0.023255486
anton carrass and he was completely new to the film going in this was a,0.17360628
completely original score so people didn't really know what to expect and the musical score,0.018393658
to this it's so memorable we always get this music playing throughout the film in,0.01811162
certain situations and after watching the film i had it stuck in my head for,0.08286525
quite a while because it's such so such a memorable piece of music and it's,0.033599757
very quirky and it's very unusual and it almost doesn't really go with the tone,0.017263511
of the film because the music in this film it's very sort of light-hearted almost,0.019854402
a bit silly and slapstick like sounding it's a real contrast to what is happening,0.3922197
in the film with obviously this murder and mystery angle that's going on for some,0.08803173
reason it just works perfectly when it almost shouldn't really and it's this music really,0.024486741
that gives the film a real modern feel to it it's the sort of thing,0.037461814
that they would do in lots of modern films now to just make it more,0.027820641
appealing make it more interesting and going back to watch a film like this in,0.06004879
1949 that was doing this is really fantastic to see and it really makes the,0.016094783
film seem very ahead of its time now in terms of the story which is,0.0099092405
really i suppose the main element of the film this is what really gripped me,0.030559868
i really loved the characters and the film i loved the performances and just the,0.013016979
story itself the constant interaction between these characters the conversations that they're having is really,0.014214309
what makes the film so interesting i was so interested in the plot in this,0.021629777
film i really like the plot we're constantly following holly martin's throughout this film and,0.034014832
i really wanted to know what was happening as we unlock more and we understand,0.02910245
and we use the audience understand more about what is going on what has happened,0.020956611
to harry lime we really want to get a sense of understanding and this film,0.0475154
does a really good job of holding my attention really wanting me to keep watching,0.044648457
and make sure that i stay until the very end of the film so overall,0.043697245
