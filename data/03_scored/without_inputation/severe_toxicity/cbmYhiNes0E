hey everyone I'm Mariana and I am back with another review talking about one of,0.026248813
my most anticipated films of the year featuring one of the most amazing ensemble casts,0.034511723
of the year knives out this is the fifth film written and directed by Rian,0.07319215
Johnson and it is a murder mystery a modern take on that classic whodunit detective,0.20121339
story here a family patriarch is found dead after his 85th birthday celebration and while,0.23307309
the death is considered to be a suicide things may not be as simple as,0.2937469
they seem so a private detective Benoit Blanc is here to investigate this entire family,0.06865427
I had a lot of fun watching this film it was incredibly entertaining and actually,0.04482606
funnier than I expected it to be there were some parts of knives out that,0.13042322
I thought were absolutely hilarious of course there are also a lot of twists and,0.02986874
turns to the story a lot of clues to keep you guessing some more obvious,0.017887453
than others I love a good mystery that revolves around family secrets and lies which,0.024862569
is pretty much the core of this film and you know people are lying here,0.0817065
not just because you can tell by the kind of family this is and the,0.024389623
kind of film that this is but also because the movie will often show you,0.023848165
the real events in a flashback and then cut back to the person in question,0.11294353
talking to the detective and telling him something a bit different which is a lot,0.040852252
of fun to watch I will say that the trailers show way too much and,0.027335722
I'm going to be very careful with the footage and the photos that I include,0.03761946
in this review not to spoil anything for you because I am so glad that,0.03086186
I wasn't really paying too much attention to the first trailer when I was watching,0.025108688
it and then decided to just avoid the rest of the trailers because now that,0.029513532
I watched all of them after seeing the film I can see how much they,0.03895914
included from the second half of the movie including some very crucial bits of information,0.026184954
basically if you did see the trailers I suggest you try to forget them as,0.040815003
much as possible back to the actual film though let's talk about that cast because,0.020102516
all of these actors are great unfortunately with a cast this large you are bound,0.0685066
to have people who are underused which definitely happened in this film but there were,0.014046683
some amazing standout performances that were really fun to watch we have Toni Collette and,0.023660582
Jamie Lee Curtis who are both absolutely hilarious and very memorable even though they don't,0.04277929
have huge roles Toni Collette especially her performance is just the right amount of exaggerated,0.06754541
and I guarantee you're going to remember her character after seeing this film Michael Shannon,0.017977918
always has an intense presence on screen and knives out is no exception I am,0.07192498
yet to see him in a role where he doesn't stand out no matter if,0.08486812
it's big or small Chris Evans of course is wonderful he is one of the,0.023772998
grandsons and he is kind of a spoiled playboy which is a lot of fun,0.15261109
to watch he has some great scenes in there Ana de Armas whom you may,0.063614175
remember from Blade Runner 2049 has one of the bigger roles and she is the,0.011737831
nicest person in this cast of characters she really does well plane this genuinely caring,0.052472346
and kind human being and of course Daniel Craig as the detective is as good,0.05037768
as you would expect this is an excellent role for him although I will say,0.041552026
that his accent here really threw me off he has a very heavy over-the-top southern,0.08784282
accent in the film and I get that perhaps this was meant to be over-the-top,0.015972389
for a comedic purpose but it just really took me out almost every scene it,0.03682723
just felt like he was putting on an accent here which of course he was,0.034475803
because this is not what Daniel Craig sounds like in real life but he has,0.037508376
done a southern accent before in Logan lucky which I thought was great I thought,0.04947769
he did a really good job in that film here though it just it seemed,0.014924061
off to and it seemed like it was work for him also since I am,0.027289825
getting into some of my issues with the film I have to say that some,0.042157345
of the writing was a little too cheesy both the dialogue and some of the,0.022437975
actions that characters took even though I get that this is a very comedic mystery,0.027441487
and it's meant to be crowd pleasing and fun some of it was just a,0.06304943
little too ridiculous and to go along with that there are a lot of attempts,0.31559962
in this film to be hashtag relevant through dialogue which I thought were really out,0.061000668
of place in this story in particular I just did not think this was necessary,0.040387955
at all here I don't have an issue with that as a thing of its,0.02403242
own but in this story this could have been such a timeless murder mystery especially,0.0878834
with the set up and this gorgeous atmospheric house and the overall production design and,0.04796373
this snake nest of a family and all of this brought together this is such,0.15161997
a classic murder mystery set up but then they have these buzzword jokes about snowflakes,0.16637573
and all trite roles and politics and Instagram influencers which I just don't think this,0.04019439
story needed basically what I'm trying to say here is that there were these small,0.025734626
things that kept this movie from being even better this could have been a really,0.014916078
fantastic film it could have been one of my favorites of the year like top,0.039732084
five material however these small things kind of add it up and instead of having,0.026453024
a fantastic film it ended up being really great I would still absolutely recommend you,0.047114957
go see it it is so much fun to watch especially figure with other people,0.08685303
