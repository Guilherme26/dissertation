what's up guys my name is Aaron at the same i'm going to be reviewing,0.034532342
mood light this is a john movie that's directed by barry chickens and the stars,0.04704511
a bunch of people the basic story is telling about this young man Shire own,0.055446383
and it tells his story kind of in three chapters him as a boy and,0.045524504
was a teenager and then him as a man and is talking about like how,0.04451542
how people treat him in the black culture because he's kind of different honestly about,0.32138053
that and how those actions and how those choices that some people made around him,0.021703612
kind of shaped the person that he became I was looking forward to this for,0.11254508
a reason I heard this was like an amazing movie like I've been hearing buzz,0.07118862
about this movie for months so I wanted to give us a try like usually,0.02468563
whatever movies have like this type of hype this kind of rare whenever they actually,0.056393605
kind of meet my expectations you know the last time that actually happened was probably,0.016354205
mad max fury road they'll probably the last time I was like yeah the buzz,0.11001406
for this movie was definitely appreciated but yeah this one I feel like it's going,0.026901357
to go up along with like Mad Max fury road as like a masterpiece movie,0.044198126
I feel like the story again it kind of shows how this boy goes from,0.028766531
childhood into adulthood it kinda reminds me of movie boyhood but I feel like this,0.039722107
is actually a little bit more emotionally involved because you really do care for the,0.071821876
kid because of how strong of a writing is it tells you the story in,0.024401598
three different chapters if it has three different actors playing shine room I feel like,0.02871132
that would kind of be the breaking point for the movie if the actors were,0.03876491
great portraying him and I felt like the actors were really good kind of showcasing,0.040977973
his transformation and I'm like that they did showing in three different chapters because you,0.059303116
kind of have to guess what happened in between those chapters that they're showing you,0.03225276
to kind of see the emotional baggage and the stuff that Shiro and had to,0.022477886
carry and stuff it kind of like forced you to think about it it's kind,0.10590056
of heartbreaking and you know it just makes you kind of think about Tyrone the,0.03884606
writing is pretty simple it's not like a lot of big words or anything like,0.079413615
that but it's pretty effective to me you really do get a sense of caring,0.052300066
for the characters you get a caring for the situation that shy road is put,0.017908074
in and like I like that the writing feels really authentic black culture it doesn't,0.25654987
feel like people are like a pro ready that makes sense i think that the,0.02059076
writers in the director has stuff did a really good job making this feel like,0.015613191
a relatable situation for everybody i do like the messages of the movie to basically,0.031543672
about like masculinity and the black culture and sexuality and black culture things are kind,0.2827013
of touching the black people basically if you're like different from everybody else like kind,0.51804173
of looked down upon a black culture and kind of ostracized and this movie like,0.54443604
really captures the essence of that a fella they did like a really beautiful job,0.13116157
doing that I don't know I just never seen this type of movie done with,0.031234363
black keep when I thought that was really cool like the themes weren't beating you,0.45357004
over the head it was pretty subtle with the way that they did it was,0.042937603
pretty much with the writing the characters that were in the movie I thought that,0.015736915
that really told message is really well and that was a really cool aspect of,0.018120933
it and one of the performances were just like amazing all over there are no,0.040039398
weak points in this at all the three actors that are playing Shiro I've really,0.027593814
felt like that's where the strength of the movie relies on you have to nail,0.08450693
these characters really well and I feel like those actors did a really good job,0.047047775
kind of portraying like the mannerisms that shy Rome carries just the way that he,0.02958737
carries his body his facial expressions I felt like that was really well done just,0.18186253
like no emotional baggage that this character has I feel like that was properly shown,0.03257737
really well these actors I'm just the way that they interacted and stuff like that,0.06848465
in a way that they talked I felt like it was really a parent know,0.036824565
this was the same person that's actually kind of scared because you know it's not,0.046346005
really the same person but the actors just do such a really good job like,0.033688225
making it feel like it is that I felt like that was really cool and,0.036480665
the same thing goes for the actors that plays Kevin chevrons friend Andre Hollen key,0.021491418
was in American Horror Story roanoke I feel like he did a pretty good job,0.046625383
how showcasing that character and doing a really good job with that I'd like no,0.050467484
Amy Harris as shy Ron's like drug addicted mom I felt like she was pretty,0.31547818
good you could see that she had like this kind of inner turmoil about like,0.04339791

I can really see her being really good and when Ruby's she wanted to give,0.059677616
that a try but Mahalo Ali the dude that was Captain mouth and Luke Cage,0.10313739
I thought that he was probably like the best of the supporting characters he plays,0.012393037
this like Street dude who kind of takes in Shiro and he kind of sees,0.14330184
that he's like an outsider and he kind of you know gives him advice on,0.05927518
how to act he's just kind of there for him and he provides kind of,0.08487677
like a safe haven with janelle monae's character and i felt like he was just,0.033310402
really great you could see the humanity kind of just coming off of his body,0.36189723
just his face of the way that he you know just acted around him and,0.13155603
then he has a really heartbreaking scene with shower on that was just like really,0.037695292
