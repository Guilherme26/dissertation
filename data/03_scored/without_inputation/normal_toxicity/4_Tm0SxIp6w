so you have a wonder woman sequel for me,0.4054802
yes sir,0.049303908
i do,0.05164125
so we're gonna start the movie with diana,0.07955803
as a kid back in themyscira,0.18613526
okay okay and what's she up to well she's competing in the amazon version of that tv show wipeout and she tries to use a shortcut to win and learns that cheating is wrong sure okay,0.14597337
that's a nice quick message to start the movie off it's gonna take a full 11 minutes,0.11518479
oh my god so then we're going to jump forward to the 1980s which is when this movie takes place okay okay,0.10288018
so like 30 40 years ago oh i don't enjoy that,0.10172539
that's a true thing,0.06654576
so anyway diana is still super heartbroken about steve trevor dying in the first movie he's all she can think about really after all that time,0.16279015
yeah,0.040847696
well i mean you gotta understand this was a really good guy,0.116151854
she knew for a couple of days seven decades ago,0.12123551
well yeah i guess so so anyway diane is working in washington dc at the smithsonian and she has a new co-worker named barbara what's her deal,0.07710519
oh she's a freaking,0.7360383
nerd sir,0.5876557
she can't even walk in heels oh embarrassing disgusting and pathetic,0.9018015
i bet nobody likes her yeah,0.3522668
and so there's this artifact called the dream stone and that's what this movie's going to focus on,0.059258033
oh what's this thing dude,0.11497397
oh this thing's freaking nuts it grants wishes but it takes something in return a very magical stone,0.5768754
and this phony business guy max lord he gets his hand on it and he wishes to become the dreamstone,0.3854259
oh so he turns to stone you would think so the way that was phrased but no now he can grant people's wishes when they touch him and he can take something in return do barbara and diana get wishes in before,0.15025388
he does that they do barbara wishes to be more like diana,0.10581938
so she gets some nice clothes and some super strength and now she can walk in heels now that's impressive,0.20426555
am i right,0.059329823
yeah she's not pathetic anymore also she removes her glasses which as you know makes people automatically more attractive,0.605039
that's just good character development is what that is and so diana's gonna wish for steve trevor to come back to life,0.1140828
and this way we could get chris pine back in the movie oh people like chris pine,0.21826132
so what does he just appear out of thin air actually no his consciousness goes into this random guy's body,0.286247
so everybody sees this random guy but we see chris pine okay is this because the stone can't make things just magically show up no it absolutely can a giant wall is going to appear out of nowhere,0.1381695
so are some nukes,0.24022055
i mean the thing is magic,0.0936693
why are we doing this weird body control thing with steve,0.2669514
i don't know what happens to this guy's consciousness while steve's controlling his body who's to say you are,0.47817856
yeah what if this guy has a job and a family he has to get to the implications are insane where is his consciousness is he dead,0.46644044
oh well here's the thing sir i'm gonna need you to get all the way off my back about this body control thing get off of it oh that felt vaguely threatening so i'm gonna get off your back about that great,0.38143116
and so then steve and diana obviously they get intimate,0.19291481
because you know they love each other they do that using a stranger's body,0.1809921
that's got that's got to be crossing a line,0.059557
that's not okay,0.07129188
yeah,0.040847696
well we're going to have them do it anyway and i find it strange that you immediately got back on my back about that i mean,0.23800966
it's actually a really easy fix just have steve trevor show up as himself,0.15514678
no,0.06626663
so then that max lord guy makes himself super rich and he goes to egypt to take some guy's oil and make himself even richer,0.112321176
okay so steve and diana they gotta get over there,0.086148776
you know how are they gonna do that,0.069419935
well the thing is they can't just take a commercial flight,0.063902155
because steve doesn't have a passport,0.1270548
no i mean the guy he's possessing probably has one,0.12294927
yeah,0.040847696
well they don't check for that they head to the smithsonian and steal one of the jets from over there,0.26372826
they have operational jets at the museum,0.06479695
they do yeah fully fuel jets just lying around,0.18733099
so they take one of those because steve was a pilot okay he was a pilot in world war one these are those those are different planes,0.22962737
well,0.039254032
i mean a plane is a plane,0.07024913
that's i mean okay,0.08506112
yeah that sentence is not technically wrong,0.07585843
so there you go but okay sir,0.069149934
a plane is a plane,0.051129162
are you implying that a plane's not a plane because a plane is a plane,0.08640134
i mean that's just such a vague general statement a plane is a plane okay so then they're being chased because of the jet theft and so wonder woman goes ahead and makes it invisible and that's how she gets her invisible jet what how well turns out that's a thing,0.18988949
she can do,0.068621494
so she does the thing that she can do,0.09858958
well thank god,0.07645191
she has that ability we never once mentioned,0.24053892
a reference it works out great,0.10552958
so they go to egypt and they have a big chase scene with max lord oh very exciting,0.09764473
but he freaking gets away and he goes around causing a bunch more chaos then he goes to see the president of the united states what for well he gets the president to wish for more nukes,0.5488211
and then he sees this technology just lying around in the oval office,0.39391482
and it's exactly what he needs,0.07451839
what do you mean what's this device that lets him take over everybody's screen around the world,0.097225256
so technically through like satellite waves,0.12164937
he is you know he's touching them,0.31089434
how i don't worry about it,0.11169116
okay it won't,0.0690132
so then there's gonna be this fight in the white house and barbara she's turning evil,0.45158345
so she gets in on that too okay and steve manages to grab max lord oh and so he wishes for everything to go back to normal,0.20708932
oh yeah no that would have been smart instead,0.16040693
he pushes him around a bit also a decent strategy,0.08294644
yeah so then max lord escapes and he heads off to the satellite island to do his broadcast wow wow wow and steve and diana find out that everybody needs to renounce their wishes or else civilization's gonna end,0.31089434
so they have this big emotional goodbye,0.15379879
oh very sad very sad,0.14565289
but then she starts to fly and lasso some lightning bolts,0.11945443
so that's pretty cool that's that's not bad,0.08923171
oh sure yeah that may as well happen,0.06122363
so then diana's gonna have to fight barbara who by the way is a cat,0.25094745
now what yeah she's a cat,0.38838306
now she's part cheetah,0.23011059
what are you talking about,0.07210274
well see max lord was like,0.066868074
hey anything else you want,0.1503265
and she's like yes,0.11936952
actually i would like to be an apex predator,0.4845121
please so she could have just as easily been turned into a killer whale,0.43410313
yeah i guess there was a chance,0.044468924
she could have turned into a you know orca whale but that would have made for a less interesting fight scene,0.32805273
oh i wholeheartedly,0.07272756
disagree,0.117302604
anyway so then we're gonna have a barely visible fight scene and barbara's gonna get electrocuted,0.31028584
oh so she dies oh no she gets a little sleepy which is what happens,0.34796447
when cats get electrocuted,0.19545923
that's not,0.0632968
no,0.06626663
i don't think that's accurate,0.07624602
well,0.039254032
that's what my dad told me,0.0725514
when my childhood cat chewed through his extension cord that your cat died i think no sir,0.5418357
he went to sleep then he went to live on a farm and i never saw him again i mean okay,0.24088651
so what happens next oh well max is granting wishes to everybody in the world through their screens,0.13470362
most of the world doesn't speak english,0.14190571
okay,0.050967902
yeah i'll keep that in mind for trivia night,0.16490887
i guess that's interesting anyway,0.07033223
it's gonna be complete chaos,0.1509032
oh it is,0.052889027
yep people are killing each other with wishes,0.67115706
one guy gets a farm outside his apartment,0.15292034
people can wish for anything,0.2416896
really,0.0339359
yeah it's gonna be nuts statistically speaking wouldn't at least one person wish for the guy that just showed up on their tv to die or for the world to end,0.39331645
wouldn't at least one person wish for world peace,0.10494654
what happens with that paradox,0.1063151
well i mean that's got that's like a one in a million kind of wish right,0.09766255
there are billions of people in the world you're just full of fun trivia tonight,0.16617249
so anyway,0.060613755
diana has to lasso this guy,0.18667658
but her lasso can't get through this mysterious wind around him,0.1349844
oh wow it's gonna be tough for her to defeat him if she can't reach him actually it's gonna be super easy barely an inconvenience,0.1754757
oh really yeah see she gets her lasso around his ankle and then she can talk to everybody through him,0.23977566
i thought she couldn't get through with that thing,0.17367314
oh yeah no she couldn't,0.18711384
but then she could but how unclear well okay then,0.076282226
so then she tells everybody to renounce their wishes because nothing good comes from lying and everybody does it everybody does it including max lord who suddenly cares about his son that he's been actively ignoring the whole movie and so what about like what if someone with a terminal illness wished to be cured,0.2610149
oh well they would have they would have to renounce that because that's that's not the truth,0.076496966
uh what if a blind person wished to be able to see that's uh that's that's a shortcut,0.28472167
uh to being able to see,0.10370678
so that's that's wrong,0.09170404
what if somebody wished to be able to feed their starving child,0.42921346
yeah,0.040847696
okay,0.050967902
this moment only works if everybody wishes for something selfish or violent,0.25863162
so we're gonna have to pretend like,0.07861392
that's the case okay,0.07782999
oh pretending is tight,0.24328235
okay,0.050967906
let's do it,0.061189085
okay,0.050967902
thank god,0.053215954
so then max lord is gonna go reunite with his son who just kind of comes running out of the woods for no reason how did max lord get back from the island if he renounced all his wishes unclear and what happens with barbara well she's not a cat anymore,0.0863558
and she's she's chilling,0.24866053
i imagine okay anyway then diana's gonna have a little flirty moment with the guy who steve was controlling it's gonna be very sweet,0.15836804
he's already seen that guy naked,0.5499723
yeah just a real sweet moment it's gonna be christmas,0.09884699
too,0.030334655
yeah,0.040847696
i don't know if it being christmas makes it better,0.09387202
and then she looks at a balloon and we're all done,0.09037034
so what do you think i mean i feel like using a strange man's,0.15416555
body is just so deeply strange and raises so many messed up questions right right right,0.09886823
well maybe nobody will think of how weird it is,0.11834458
well,0.039254032
yeah i guess that is a possibility okay,0.06345122
let's do it,0.06118907
