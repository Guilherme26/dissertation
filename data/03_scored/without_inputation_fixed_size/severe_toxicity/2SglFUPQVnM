men in the middle of World War two who had every second are in danger,0.18450332
of being eliminated by the Germans and it's about how these men got off of,0.22665045
those shores the civilians that got in their own personal boats to travel there to,0.029113758
help them and the stories of these men trying to do everything they possibly can,0.030362973
to survive naturally I was excited for this movie I think most people who love,0.041998364
movies are because it's directed by Christopher Nolan and so obviously you're instantly thinking to,0.05345815
yourself okay at the very least this is going to be a magnificent spectacle and,0.06776957
Dunkirk utilizes real boats real planes real locations humongous amounts of extras to immerse you,0.06667867
in this moment to make you feel so completely taken over by it and it,0.017976588
works this movie is thrilling imagine Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor say what you want about,0.016394781
that movie it's not good but cut out the first like 90 minutes and the,0.06615251
film just starts with the attack on Pearl Harbor and the rest of the movie,0.03817489
is the attack and that's the whole film from the opening shot of Dunkirk you,0.2542811
are in it we're introduced to a few characters very quickly and then you are,0.02312644
instantaneously in this battle and it never lets up there's never a dull moment there's,0.058641925
never a scene where characters sit around a campfire and say who do you got,0.0272559
at home wait for you yeah my wife's pregnant I got a kid in school,0.1671347
well actually the school ain't there anymore cuz the Nazis blew it up Oh boohoo,0.2879623
there's never a moment like that you don't get those moments that you're so used,0.027321087
to seeing in war films and sometimes that can be a hindrance on the film,0.04692538
as well because my one major issue with this movie which doesn't detract from it,0.03055255
too much is that I didn't feel a specific connection with any one character like,0.014765081
I wanted to root for them or I connected with them emotionally in fact I,0.12879352
suppose who you might view as the audience character the one young person that you're,0.012392371
introduced to in the opening scene barely speaks a word for the first half of,0.03631903
the movie this movie is about the event it's about this evacuation of all of,0.035574023
these men it's about being in the middle of a horrific situation my buddy who,0.22258575
I saw the movie with Craig said it best he said when you are in,0.03510307
a situation like this you don't go hey my name is Ben no that's cool,0.02566345
my name is Kevin you know what do you like oh I don't know there's,0.027607117
bombs all over the place right now and I was just hoping we could have,0.46869168
a nice conversation this movie is in the moment and the way Noland Helms all,0.032521494
of these battle sequences it's what film was invented for everything on the screen looks,0.027770752
completely authentic there's never a moment that feels wasted there's not a scene that feels,0.040694606
misplaced and although it's very simplistic in its characterization its storytelling isn't and I don't,0.0643951
want to get into why because I feel that that would be spoiler territory but,0.035815485
there's a moment in this film where I saw a character in the nighttime and,0.025388064
I went wait a second I like the film is about an hour and 46,0.019910943
minutes which is very short for Noland and when I found that out I was,0.041323204
surprised by it but since the film begins in the battle and ends in the,0.015748888
battle and it's just a battle it's one gigantic sequence told in a very interesting,0.030985584
way and the runtime I think is perfect because if it had gone on any,0.08005818
longer I think would have outstayed its welcome if it was any shorter there wouldn't,0.03415585
have been enough impact the impact of this movie emotionally doesn't come from you going,0.032751646
I hope that that person makes it out of this situation so he can get,0.07219238
home to his family it comes from seeing this spectacle some might not like that,0.04988611
it is about the spectacle the aerial dogfights sequences with Tom Hardy whose eyeballs act,0.061403766
very well in this film that poor guy is always gonna wear a mask I,0.18243793
think and everything he's gonna have something over his face those dogfights are so riveting,0.1531459
and so white-knuckled because they look authentic the planes don't blow up in theatrical ways,0.27198663
the gunfire does not look like movie gunfire everything about it just feels so scarily,0.058915317
real that despite the fact that the characters aren't really given much set up and,0.009351817
this movie is 100% about this moment I was riveted from seeing one because I,0.05104952
felt like I was there Hans Zimmer's score once again something he does with Nolan,0.044811428
movies it's not so much melodical as it is almost sound design and I am,0.03220154
still playing these noises in my head and I will be purchasing the soundtrack and,0.12112263
I can't wait to hear it again if you go into Dunkirk expecting a one,0.037315473
two three four five straightforward narrative with characters with emotional arcs and big moments where,0.012591261
they explode with incredible dialogue you're not going to get that this movie as I,0.21252218
said is very simplistic but it's also highly realistic people die in war and sometimes,0.1548787
people die alone terrified having no idea what's going on and does that person get,0.29896182
an amazing arc or is someone there to tell them everything's going to be okay,0.07052809
not always and this film doesn't shy away from showing that yes there's not too,0.023700492
much blood it's pg-13 there are no limbs flying around there's no intense gruesome imagery,0.18244524
but it's the psychological impact on all of the characters involved with this movie that,0.051554393
make it so frightening because you're witnessing characters who are so horrified by what they're,0.041242052
seeing or by what they feel could happen to them they are all desperately clawing,0.07329193
to get out and the ones who are trying to go in to help you,0.019942205
also feel for them the whole film captures this event so beautifully that it's tough,0.020239543
to really pinpoint any magnificently huge flaws beyond the fact that the characters are lacking,0.022457264
I'm gonna give Dunkirk an a excellent war films like Saving Private Ryan are about,0.06914651
characters in a horrible situation they're about seeing these people react to war Dunkirk is,0.03806846
just about war and how horrific aliy terrifying it can be when you're stuck in,0.06987155
