talking about spider-man into the spider verse and I'm gonna tell you why I loved,0.04794511
it and why I think it's one of the best feature links spider-man movies we've,0.037580214
ever gotten so stick around now unlike the spider-man films of the past this one,0.05071959
focuses on Miles Morales another normal kid that much like Peter Parker gets a spider,0.12734741
bite that transforms him into the very same hero that he knows from the comics,0.11564417
Morales has a lot of trouble coming to terms with his abilities and he absolutely,0.073397696
thinks he's alone until other versions of the hero from different dimensions including the famous,0.03491017
Peter Parker arrived in to his world and they're gonna need more alice's helps you,0.026756346
stop a threat to not only the dimension that morales knows his home but the,0.052929327

part his live adaptations other than Rama's first two films and the most recent homecoming,0.038367126
just haven't really connected to me that much spider-man was one of the few comics,0.029971179
I was able to get my hands on and read as a kid and unlike,0.15924563
other heroes the webslinger can very easily bring back that childhood nostalgia Morales was a,0.01926771
version of the story unfamiliar to me but regardless I felt like a kid again,0.04049638
watching this movie because it just captured that Spiderman atmosphere that I remember growing up,0.026614662
I thought it was an awesome blend of modern and retro it was pulled off,0.059879165
from a combination of elements but I think first and foremost the animation style was,0.0155925695
fantastic and it was perfectly selected for this story it has like a London Street,0.02174951
Art vibe to it that I thought complemented the overall mood of the film very,0.02343442
effectively but it also has a blend of like pencil art and watercolor that make,0.020147081
it look like just storyboards pulled from the comic book pages itself it wasn't as,0.061763633
vibrant as you would expect from today's animated films but it still had plenty of,0.031384695
rich depth to it that I found to be more than immersive enough but to,0.026659895
me is equally impressive as the artistic appeal was I think the writing of both,0.017833574
the storyline itself and the dialogue was also excellent it was down-to-earth and blended with,0.021668358
just enough self-awareness historical away it was a - with some nice meta it created,0.047089014
an appealing range of personalities and character types that really grabbed on to me to,0.02258631
make me invest into this storyline the humor was very sharp it was witty and,0.04223251
I went in expecting a superhero adventure and not only did I get a great,0.05695901
one but I also got a great comedy as well I think the cast of,0.03591526
voice talent was fantastic from top to bottom they all brought life and emotion and,0.11950756
warmth to the characters by providing a ton of charisma through their vocal work I,0.022585645
think this added with some already great dialog combined with a simplistic but very warm,0.077704094
art design just pumped a ton of life and charisma into this film to create,0.14094976
characters I genuinely cared about in a story that maintained my intrigue because of its,0.04433715
freshness I don't always get pulled into animated films despite thoroughly enjoying them but this,0.03149445
was the first one that I can remember in many years that completely consumed me,0.026508233
and made me feel like a kid again I appreciated how this movie explored the,0.08488608
world of spider-man in a very fun creative way that peeled back layers to the,0.07314692
universe I had never been able to experience before it created a blend of characters,0.026222205
that had me wanting to see more of them which is definitely a positive for,0.06165787
an animated film that's hovering at just under two hours and I know what's gonna,0.041802134
sound like it's cliche and a little bit exaggerated but this was an animated movie,0.057350803
that truly felt like it was pulled from the pages of a comic book I,0.066167146
loved how this film embraced new avenues in the spider-man universe it introduces the world,0.044509433
to Miles Morales and it creates a backdrop and a personality for him that I,0.084755704
think can connect to people as strongly as Peter Parker has over the years in,0.015055101
my opinion and I love the doors that this opens to exploring new characters in,0.025328863
this multiverse and while this doesn't really directly set up any sequels it definitely lays,0.034854293
the groundwork to many more stories that can be told but I do wish ahead,0.009714342
maybe focused a little bit more on Morales the first half of the film lets,0.05175794
us really get to know him I enjoyed what was there and I just really,0.0135005675
wanted to see a lot more of that and as things continue in the plot,0.037772454
begins to evolve the focus begins to shift to a lot of the other moving,0.02883172
pieces and while I did enjoy where the story goes and how it comes back,0.025259683
to Morales I just honestly wanted to see more of him but that's not to,0.04121611
say that this wasn't an entertaining story because it absolutely as I loved it the,0.038208812
action sequences were amazing and adrenaline pumping the musical score was fantastic as well it,0.04189127
heightened every scene like it needed to and it only added to just the overall,0.11493376
mood and atmosphere of the story the attempts at humor were very effective the cast,0.016546443
pumped a ton of life into the film with their voiceovers and the hype for,0.060940135
this film being extremely high is warranted and to me spider-man into the spider-verse is,0.055445716
gonna get 95% on the entertainment meter I went into this one hoping for a,0.025872318
