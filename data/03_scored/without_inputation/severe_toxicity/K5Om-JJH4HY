putting up like the budget is 20 million did you put up to 20 million,0.04091877
oh you put up a fraction of that and then the other studios absorb some,0.03614275
of the calls too I always wondered that anyway that's neither here nor there that's,0.011811001
a different conversation yeah Jordan Peele man and Jordan Peele has everybody excited yeah he's,0.074513204
the new it director right now and his warranted get out was fantastic everybody loved,0.09028604
it it was a game-changer you know the follower wheel a yes follow up let's,0.022023566
go an original idea in the original concept and since I'm doing the review late,0.030231932
it made 71 million dollars over the weekend which is the note to Hollywood people,0.022692075
want original stuff you don't have to remake everything you know say you don't have,0.03625118
this you'll have to give a sequel to every movie that made a little money,0.07434691
man original concepts can work as well that's not a shot to Halloween you know,0.095926136
I wanted to see Michael Myers again he was disappointed but still I respected him,0.02863682
coming back in the conjuring movies I would like to see another one but I'm,0.046264853
just saying like you know the original concept can work this this movie I don't,0.027852569
want to give too much away this is very like anything can spoil this movie,0.05145528
so it's gonna be a weird review but it's about a family that comes across,0.029774286
their doppelgangers and like the doppelgangers are you know they're not here on good terms,0.08857386
so it's like you know you're chilling with your family and then you see these,0.077469945
people that look exactly like you but they told you no saying you were out,0.04500566
here looking fresh to devil your doppelganger looking raggedy and look like he got ruffled,0.2387084
up in a coffee machine and then he just standing there looking at you and,0.030776717
it's like yo man this is creepy it's creepy man and that's what it's all,0.11588231
about how does this family survive the encounter with their you know raggedy doppelgangers or,0.051390093
in the movie they called the tether that's essentially what the movies about without giving,0.019800521
too much away it stars Lupita Nyong'o I don't know if I said her name,0.065515935
right she's an Academy Award winner she was in Star Wars she did voice work,0.021431552
for and she was also one of the stars and black panther and also her,0.0019643253
co-star that plays her husband in this play about Winston Dukes he was also a,0.04056689
scene stealer in black pants and it's funny those two met in college and acting,0.29070455
workshop so it's dope that they got to work together again on the professional to,0.06423412
making that money it was just dope to see from an acting standpoint us is,0.050731562
dope one of the takeaways from this movie is Lupita's acting skills it was just,0.1095604
incredible to see her play two different versions of herself and it's funny like when,0.0329685
you watch the movie the effects were so seamless on that you don't even notice,0.04214537
it you don't even realize it's the same people interacting with one of them like,0.043638043
I legit forgot no that's the same people you know say remembering Back to the,0.025975421
Future to when it was a big deal well they always bit-bit but you could,0.08189608
kind of see the special effects at work haci you know like when he threw,0.037377335
the the Almanac to the other side of the car you saw how fake the,0.08478231
Almanac looked on the tall silver but now you know they stepped it up a,0.023111805
little bit and in us is seamless and you know it was probably probably easier,0.06872345
because you know a lot of those scenes were darker so you can hide the,0.15672326
special effects within the dark scene but it was still dope but the acting though,0.060930155
Oh Lupita's act it was like two completely different people was the same person so,0.02334994
a lot of you know a lot of people compared to Toni Collette you know,0.03539043
performance in the red interior last year which I feel like she should have got,0.02300205
an Oscar nomination for I don't know why she didn't I started watching the favorite,0.035556063
with the lady that won Best Actress and I was like I turned it off,0.038407702
but did something like the the time period in the wardrobe with a favorite the,0.033966273
corsets and the big ridiculous hair and the women walking around like this just this,0.42790508
is some castles and just shooting ducks die anyway that's neither here nor there her,0.41346955
performance was fired another takeaway from this movie man Jordan Peele it's just a shout,0.14409275
out to you know people that started in comedy like rooted in comedy improv comedy,0.09035389
sketches I just like to see that it just shows the versatility of funny people,0.040156472
like from the mind of Jordan Peele which many were introduced to him by a,0.018911837
sketch show like MADtv can't feel and now he's wish there was like creepy moving,0.16989589
this like yo the transition is dope now he's about to do the twilight zone,0.13574336
and it just goes to show that you know put your ideas forward man you,0.075799674
know don't worry about like nah nobody's gonna get it just do it just do,0.03983652
it and I hope he pops off is one of the major directors in the,0.07020548
game like you know like when tan Tito - the the n-word every five scenes,0.0832617
you know st. Quentin no st. you see it too much you write it too,0.05785834
much I should say so my review I can't really nitpick as if I mean,0.044839364
if I nitpick I'm a spoiler so I really need to do a spoiler review,0.044931825
for this movie but I'm not gonna do it but I enjoyed it like they,0.049459066
were creepy moments there were tense moments the acting really drew you in and then,0.07130569
this move this movie's gonna be polarizing a lot of people not gonna feel it,0.07131633
so if he was gonna feel it the people can get the underlying messages which,0.023455705
may or may not be there like this is a movie where you can kind,0.06300353
of interpret yourself and normally I'm not a fan of that but I went in,0.031783804
knowing that I went in knowing like it's probably gonna be some deeper level stuff,0.023419786
did we get a piece together ourselves so I was like all right okay I,0.052868795
was along for it I feel like it's a lot of Easter eggs within the,0.052981213
movie that will make you watch it again which is genius in itself so I,0.03698022
cared enough to watch it again you know what I mean so that's a plus,0.050059725
I'm like go for the acting man just go for the acting the creep factor,0.14686789

if you guys see movie yoni doing something that's alright man movies movies that have,0.037875555
like dual double characters of doppelgangers or whatever it's not that many movies that come,0.036022354
