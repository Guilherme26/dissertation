now i've googled how to pronounce that i apologize if it's wrong,0.15131035
the author drew on inspiration from her own life and feelings of jealousy towards her new husband's ex-fiancee,0.19584714
now rebecca is about a young woman who marries an aristocratic and diversely handsome widower maxim de winter,0.16329606

dewinter believes she pales in comparison to the first my suggestion didn't seem to go at all well sorry oh but you don't understand it's that,0.10804881
i well i'm not the sort of person men marry,0.24003151
i don't know what you mean i don't belong in your sort of world for one thing,0.3320345
well what is my sort of word well mandolin,0.110948905
you know what i mean rebecca was alfred hitchcock's first hollywood film after many years of success back in his home of the uk it was produced by david o,0.15053856
selznick who was fresh off and riding high from the success of gone with the wind which was released the year before now speaking of gone with the wind vivian lee who was newly married to lawrence olivier was determined to play the role of the second mrs,0.09448402
dewinter mainly so she could act opposite,0.17774758
lawrence olivier now the director and the producers weren't so convinced she was right for the role not because she's not a great actress,0.15298755
i mean she just won the best actor award at actress award academy awards but they believed that her personality was too strong for the meek and mild and sister winter,0.09052218
so luckily for us though the audition tape with laurent olivier still exists,0.14983775
we don't know sir,0.14974868
because danvers is very distressed about it find out who broke it and make them be more careful in the future,0.10249586
yes samus,0.24102998

danvers,0.12952426
that's what i've got,0.06826755
oh no,0.06270428
no,0.06626663
please max and will you tell her and let me go upstairs in charlotte chandler's book,0.15400334
it's only a movie which was a biography dedicated to alfred hitchcock olivier is quoted as saying when they called to say someone named joan fontaine had been given the role opposite me i can't say i was thrilled,0.19580026
i'd certainly never heard of her when i met her what i noticed was how young and skinny she was i didn't really understand what my character maxim dewinter could see in her as i understood max better i decided that she was just what he wanted someone exactly the opposite of rebecca,0.11414727
he had enough of rebecca,0.102154575
he was looking for docile even wilted at david o'sale's next insistence and still quite rare in hollywood today the movie faithfully adapts the plot of the book,0.085171245
there are a few minor or quite major plot differences that had to kind of be enforced,0.08222709
because because of the hollywood production code which was in place at the time mainly,0.065083966
now this is a spoiler,0.078553475
if you haven't seen the movie you read the book stop watching,0.103494845
but in the book maxim does shoot and kill rebecca,0.5211471
but according to the code the killing of a spouse had to be punished which in the book and film it is not so her death is declared a suicide and it's kept that way interestingly there are undertones and hints to a romantic relationship between rebecca and mrs,0.2423474
danvers which of course thanks to the code could not be fully explored,0.10800076
but hitchcock in his genius way found a way to subtly hint at it,0.58865607
when mrs,0.061795913
danvers is showing the new mrs,0.14980777
de winter rebecca's negligee,0.15006222
he proves that just the thought,0.06082232
and the implication of nudity can be just as powerful as nudity itself did you ever see anything,0.26278183
so delicate look you can see my hand rebecca was released in april 1940 to critical and commercial acclaim the new york times called it an altogether brilliant film haunting suspenseful handsome,0.14864603
and handsomely played it was nominated for 11 academy awards,0.05553965
and won two including one for best picture which was alfred hitchcock's only best picture academy award i am such a massive lawrence olivier fan that's painfully obvious to anybody that knows me uh so anything with,0.24514353
so larry involved i'm guaranteed to love,0.076035045
but there was something special about rebecca,0.072581686
i am yeah,0.06962599
i i can see it becoming one of my favorite films it was different watching it now as opposed to when i was 17 watching as an adult with a lot more respect for the craft and filmmaking and um and more life experience,0.11432796
i guess i just i really i really enjoyed it um,0.08614812
but the standout for me was joan fontaine her beauty and talent was perfectly captured by alfred hitchcock that in times it literally took my breath the way i had to kind of sit back and go whoa that was something else,0.31089434
i can see why it won best picture it truly deserved it this film rightfully,0.100457676
so made joan fontana star and the following year she won the academy award for best actress for another hitchcock directed film suspicion which is another film i've yet to see,0.099229515
so i must watch it i'm shocked and angry that i hadn't seen it um,0.10610442
i get to read the book,0.039283704
so i would love to know if you've read it what your thoughts are in comparison to the movie and if you've seen the new film it's not out in australia yet i cannot wait to see it,0.12092322
and compare the two i'm such a massive lily james fan,0.23164904
