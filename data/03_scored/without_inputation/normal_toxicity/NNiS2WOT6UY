so last week the Irishman the latest film from Martin Scorsese dropped on Netflix with the holidays and my birthday it took me a few days to find a block of time where I could watch the entire thing but I finally completed the irishman challenge so let's talk about it,0.07763076
the Irishman tells the epic story of Frank Sheeran's time is a mafia hitman spanning multiple decades,0.3352967
so prior to this films released,0.1299797
there's been a lot of talk about,0.060238652
what is true cinema,0.07022564
the MCU all sparked by comments from Martin Scorsese but now we have the movie itself and we can evaluate it on its own terms,0.06472973
so before I give my thoughts on it go,0.09851275
and tell me what did you think down below in the comment section did you love,0.18292902
it is it,0.053881146
one of the best of the year is this true cinema,0.047027588
we a little bit disappointed was it too long all of that fun stuff,0.19091927
let me know your take also let me know if you happen to have been able to see it in the theater,0.12133855
only got a limited theatrical release for a Scorsese film this is the kind of film,0.114443205
you really do kind of want to see in the theater,0.15496562
let me know if you were able to do that down below in the comment section with that said let's get started talking about the good,0.18181111
in the first thing you have to talk about with this movie is of course the fantastic performances from our three leads,0.08614579
you've got three Hollywood icons essentially returning to the genre that puts them on the map as Hollywood icons in the case of Joe Pesci,0.0949898
he's essentially been retired for something like 20 years and has been telling people no for decades,0.10288964
and finally this is the movie that he decided to return for Martin Scorsese for this specific project and he absolutely brings his a-game and you kind of remind you how good he really is like in my household,0.11327256
I've got two kids,0.15952945
I got three kids under the age of 10 and so we watch home alone all the time and then I watch the Lethal Weapon movies all the time,0.24818923
that's what I see a lot more of than some of his more gangster kind of an actual award-winning stuff and kind of just remind you how excellent of an actor he really is in the big stuff in the subtle moment he can do it all,0.31089434
but he's been out of the spotlight for a very long time,0.10610952
the other two kind of leads here with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino,0.045703344
these are guys that of course,0.08896535
we know their a-game is the best there is but for whatever reason a lot of the roles that they've gotten over the last 20 years have been a little bit questioned,0.07392934
allah some times,0.18024337
they've been comedic stuff that you just seems a little bit embarrassing,0.53583044
why are they doing some of this stuff,0.06229583
he wondering like did they lose it a little bit if they kind of lost theirs no no no they just didn't happen to get the right roles as soon as they're working with Scorsese again I mean they are just kind of fantastic in convincing you that they are like turning into these people,0.10929791
it's very like with you know Al Pacino is showing up in Adam Sandler copies and stuff like they kind of forget in some of the other stuff,0.10526474
he's even kind of done over the last 20 years it just seems like he's doing his Pacino isms whereas here it gets back into acting and transforming into the jimmy hoffa in this film and you buy him as the charismatic leader guy that's rallying,0.18076667
all these people that behind-the-scenes really believes he's doing the right thing,0.15613721
even though he's very much doing evil things and through some of the stuff that he's doing the pride all of it because also Robert Robert DeNiro as well here similar types of situation of some of the stuff he's done recently like kind of questionable,0.10938082
and then you see him here as this guy that left World War Q with a little bit of an emptiness in his soul that allows him to do just kind of awful things and just kind of shrug it off and keep on going,0.35621136
and as you go throughout the movie and you just kind of see the sadness of his existence as it continues,0.24584207
forward,0.033463847
and he just plays that while never kind of surrendering the coldness of never surrendering the pride,0.10065275
but you just seeing the toll that it takes upon him,0.07878415
also it's a movie that's a return to kind of these classic prestige underground crime mafia type films that you know over the decade gates,0.19884843
there's been many of these that have been created,0.06195481
but over the last decade it's a genre that's kind of gone away a little bit until you have this legendary director returning to one of his genres that we haven't seen much of lately and doing a classic version of one of these massive stories of underground crime spanning large amounts of time huge cast complex plots true drama layered on top of each other there's just neat to see that again,0.08504929
it's also a movie that for its very long run time which we will talk about that later in this,0.080973625
it's actually a very quickly,0.0832367
paced movie it's not long because the scenes just drag out and there's these extended amounts of dialogue and monologues and open,0.108456604
it's not like that it actually jumps around at a very brisk pace between different plot lines different time periods different characters,0.076794095
there's a lot of different pieces and it touches on them in a way that you're constantly feel the forward motion and movement inside of it and so it's it's it's long in a very strange kind of way because it's just not like most movies like this which was a very pleasant surprises,0.105239235
I've been scared of the runtime going into it,0.14142653
it's also a film that gets very emotional as you move into the third act,0.10009679
the first two acts set up these characters their relationships the dynamics between all of them and then you start moving into the final hour and some little tragedy hard choices you start to see the toll that it's taking on them and you see their full lives play out and where the choices that they've made lead them at the end of their lives,0.048184514
and it really packs an emotional punch as you see all of this play out the way that it's handled really nicely done inside of that third act,0.2567762
with that said let's move on to the mixed aspects of the film the big thing here is with a movie of this scope and size with,0.046446737
so many plot lines and characters,0.0686934
and seeing these characters at different points of time in their life and it's kind of jumping around a little bit certain things work entirely clear as we're watching it,0.076912165
my wife said there's a whole lot being implied here,0.10272865
that's not clearly stated and to some extent,0.10501508
that's a good thing,0.060171902
you don't want the director to treat you like you're an idiot,0.96973
and over explain everything but because it's so big cuz,0.10146198
there's so much going on at times there we were having conversations while watching the movie to make sure we weren't confusing which character was which and you know and Anna Paquin shows up at one point,0.036697324
I'm like is that his daughter to his daughter right which one is it they trying to piece together who is what because there's just so much to take in in process and it implies a lot it doesn't spell it out and that can make things at confusing at times I think it could have done a little bit more to give a couple more details to make it clear exactly when things were happening how things things tie together,0.06254988
but at the same time I mean I appreciated that you didn't think I was an idiot,0.8355208
now maybe I am a little bit of an idiot,0.9133475
now that's why I mean he spelled out a little bit more but it's kind of is on that right on that line of did I need a little bit more was it good that it made me think a little bit and pay attention I'm not entirely sure from there,0.065557875
let's move on to the fat,0.33338848
and the big thing here is a little bit what I kind of implied a little bit earlier,0.31089434
but I found the payoff of the third act to be a lot more engrossing than the set up of the first two acts,0.08049304
now there was a lot of things inside of the first two acts that were great in scenes that I loved in the general vibe of it I think worked but there's just so much there and so much to take in that I think it kind of felt kept me at arm's dinks lengths distance at times because I'm just trying to sort through all the information all the characters are lead,0.056554623
the Robert DeNiro character is intentionally kind of cold-hearted,0.07347302
and so you don't initially have a big emotional connection to him because he is this hit man,0.14893529
that's just okay with what he's doing,0.1003342
and because all of that it made the third act really stand out and connect with me and resonate with me a lot more than what came before hand,0.10225352
but by comparison during that third act,0.041878767
I like felt the dread of where things were headed,0.11279104
I was scared of certain things the choices that might be made at certain points in time and felt the loneliness of these characters,0.084763184
and I didn't feel that in the first two acts I wasn't sure what I was supposed to feel at certain points in time I just kind of like interested in the narrative and then other times I was like okay what am I even supposed to be paying attention to here,0.05410857
and so that third act when it focused a lot more and we understood the relationships,0.09771025
that's when the move you really found,0.087474495
its stride for me,0.10221182
and I'd say this is but a lot of discussion on Twitter as to people posting like hey if you want to watch it,0.10358784
in four chunks,0.083556585
here's how you should break it down into four episodes and people like thrashing them like this is meant to be watched one sitting I don't maybe I shouldn't say this but I mean I think that there's a lot of merit to the idea of watching this as four different episodes like if they actually intentionally cut it that way and you retweet they absolutely the piece is just a little bit to make for 50 minute episodes out of this that were clearly focused in each piece I think that would have worked really well I also think the movie if you trimmed it down to about 2 hours 45 minutes I think it would had a lot more clarity inside of it and had a lot more punch from beginning to end as is I think it was just a little bit too big at least for a film that you're watching at home,0.15117879
that's a different experience like if I was in the theater,0.050763275
I think I would have experienced this from very differently than watching at home with all the distractions the things that happened dogs walking in kids waking up the things that happen,0.13056318
when you're in your home versus the escapism of a theatre changes the experience,0.064629704
and this as a one sit-down movie for three and a half hours it was a bit rough for me even though there's so many great things inside,0.107133344
it real quick before I give you my final thoughts on this,0.10775571
one be sure to share your thoughts down below in the comment section,0.15035546
I know a lot of people are loving this movie,0.09611091
they think it's a masterpiece,0.08880153
and so I think I've imagined we have a bit of a lively discussion between the two crafts that people have thought,0.08356515
it was fantastic,0.09903128
and the people that thought it was a little bit too long and dragged out just be respectful,0.24059516
let's share our opinions the Irishman is a very good film with fantastic performances but that I did think was a little bit too long even though it did move at a nice brisk pace,0.08034749
it's an a-minus overall,0.1875179
it's a 7.5 the entertainment scale,0.03352703
and I guess I'd say it's a must watch for cinema fans be sure to tell me what you thought down below in the comment section,0.10711198

I don't even know what it is,0.12300881
