year list I was almost finished then Roma happened what does it flick fans and,0.08116473
welcome back to my channel today I'm reviewing the brand new Netflix movie Roma I,0.057111073
feel like I'm one of the last people on YouTube to review this because so,0.115760185
many people have seen it but it's finally on Netflix it's a movie that I,0.060568392
wanted to watch in theaters it's not in a theater near me yet but it,0.102691315
will be next week and I will absolutely be watching this again in a theater,0.058472387
but first we have to talk about it premiering on Netflix if you guys don't,0.08245899
know how my reviews work I like to talk about the good the bad and,0.1164366
then give you my score this is a non-spoiler review later on today I'm reviewing,0.13378587
the brand new episode of Titans I'm watching season 8 I believe of Voltron and,0.063667916
I have a review for the mule tomorrow is Aquaman but before we can get,0.15307318
into all of those things we are talking in Romo my goodness let's get into,0.10254345
this so Romo is a story that chronicles a year in the life of a,0.07651016
middle class family in Mexico City in the early 1970s now when I first watched,0.053187046
this trailer I didn't know that was the premise I didn't know this was something,0.05583919
that was based in more realism I thought it could be potentially this alternate world,0.087033875
with these wars that are going on in the background cuz I watched that first,0.15075636
trailer I'm like this could be trippy this could be like children of men the,0.34733525
other movie that Alfonso Kuran directed a movie that I just watched a few months,0.082234636
ago and my goodness does that thing still hold up it's a fantastic film he's,0.16677901
a fantastic director so I knew the directing and the technical aspects would be well,0.025138583
done and they weren't just well done I let's get into this this may be,0.088734195
one of the most beautiful and emotionally satisfying not satisfying in the way that you,0.28467682
think just from a visual and audible standpoint movie I have seen all year and,0.02426016
in a long time Romo is just a triumph in terms of filmmaking the way,0.07960217
that the camera follows these characters it puts you in the moment the way that,0.059385937
the camera pans from left to right right to let the unique style the shot,0.26616406
selection the use of wides I love a good wide shot especially when we're talking,0.31089434
about action scenes this is not the film for that but what roma does is,0.07207125
it uses these wide shots and it doesn't necessarily focus on the character that we're,0.086315885
supposed to be looking for the film allows us to find that character it allows,0.030321937
us to focus on first of all what we want to focus on but second,0.059629492
of all you slowly start to realize what the film wants you to look at,0.118319385
and I love how he does that scene after scene after scene and every single,0.068548694
time I'm looking at one of these scenes whether it's a wide shot or a,0.17925009
tracking shot or a pan I'm sitting there thinking this is just some of the,0.15143813
best cinematography that I've ever seen now I believe if this movie was in color,0.086710304
I don't know if it would have worked as well it would have been beautiful,0.1240888
it would have been a technical masterpiece that it is right now I just think,0.047832143
the use of black and white a very gray thoroughly color corrected black and white,0.02339686
a beautiful and that was an incredible artistic choice I love that he went for,0.05225727
that and it just allowed me to see even more beauty in these scenes than,0.11608315
I would have seen if it was corrected with actual color now I'll get into,0.081688486
the first hour in my negatives it's not necessarily a negative it's just the one,0.10706996
thing towards the film where I was like I don't know if I love this,0.062013652
I don't know if I see what people are talking about because so many people,0.14947176
are calling this movie a masterpiece and they're like oh my gosh Roma I saw,0.15340398
the trailer I was intrigued I couldn't wait to watch this film but throughout the,0.06081164
first hour I sat there thinking what is the point of all this I saw,0.087177925
the beauty in it and I saw the technological masterpiece that everyone's talking about but,0.07958012
I didn't really feel that connection that I was supposed to feel for some of,0.04381043
these characters and especially our lead here who is absolutely fantastic she should be nominated,0.11565635
for every award and even though I didn't get emotionally connected to her at the,0.09046231
beginning I slowly started to realize what the hype was all about and I hope,0.064954795
you guys feel the same way I hope you continue to get locked in throughout,0.47419494
the story and then by the last 3045 minutes you are completely hooked by the,0.1071365
emotional aspects and just the way that this story goes it's not predictable it takes,0.05586879
directions that you don't anticipate I expected certain really epic things to happen in this,0.10076093
movie and I did not get that I got a real story with real characters,0.060131907
a real family things going on in the background but the focus always remains on,0.047185186
our lead and Cleo was a beautiful character and I loved every aspect of her,0.100230016
story especially once you get into that last 30 minutes at the hour and 30,0.044914242
minute mark is really when the movie went full gut punch and I lost it,0.3580677
I absolutely lost it watching this film I'm sitting on my couch this is the,0.14966023
first time all year I've truly gotten emotional and maybe it's just that story element,0.042421322
I'm not going to spoil what it is maybe that just resonated with me I,0.13482426
won't spoil anything about it but because I have a lot of friends going through,0.080472074
that portion of their lives and to see that happen with this character that I,0.14793637
have had an hour and a half to just kind of sit there and grow,0.08835956
attached to and to see everything that she's went through that the families went through,0.082264826
that she's went through with the family and then that happens and you are left,0.1284454
with this emotional hole inside of your stomach and it's like I said the first,0.6028856
time I've sat there and truly had tears in my eyes all year and it,0.10848905
was just an incredible incredibly sad but an incredible filmgoing experience but it wasn't just,0.15410407
that it's the beginning even the first hour when I was like okay can we,0.062122174
pick it up just a little bit I was still sitting there just feeling something,0.07787959
this odd strange feeling that I've not felt in a long time I was getting,0.09616453
emotional over the film making not even the story not even where it was headed,0.079791814
just how beautifully made this film was was getting me emotional and then the gut,0.1648742
punch happens within the plot that got me emotional and then that final scene where,0.26333338
the family is on vacation that's all I'm going to say my goodness I mean,0.09224814
there's nothing I can say that can really put that experience into words you guys,0.072209224
just have to watch it and experience it for yourself and it all comes down,0.13496915
to how you feel about what's going on on screen when they're at the beach,0.089871325
towards the end I related to that because my family and I that's some of,0.04392446
the best memories that I have is me and my family walking on the beach,0.08811384
on our family vacations and you can just feel the water brush up against your,0.086836286
feet when you're walking on the beach you feel the heat of the Sun and,0.071511246
that captured that perfectly you could see the Sun radiating even though the films in,0.08864539
black and white you could feel it you could get attached to it you were,0.14946789
attached to the family at the time and all of that playing with what has,0.03891682
happened to me in my lifetime the back story if you will it was just,0.07442905
way too much for me personally but in the best way possible it really hit,0.1552845
me hard towards the end and Roma is just a spectacle in all aspects and,0.19479747
don't put words in my mouth I'm not saying the first hour is bad it's,0.18071198
not bad it's beautiful it's good and even the story is well done it's just,0.067122295
the pacing was a little slower than I anticipated I thought it would move a,0.08799429
bit faster especially with koron behind the lens but it clearly did its job getting,0.08036424
me invested in this character and then once that third act hits or even the,0.10603364
second half of the film that's when I really started to realize why people are,0.067002796
saying this movie is a masterpiece and I think I agree with them I think,0.10061203
Roma is an absolute masterpiece everything that happens is just so realistic there are even,0.09350536
mistakes that the characters make and Kuran just probably said you know what we're gonna,0.06909633
leave that in because it captures the moment it captures what would actually happen and,0.0699754
it made it so much better than it could have been then we have all,0.08405155
of the stuff happening in the background whether you're talking about the riots or the,0.105428725
war or even the family aspect those things come to a head and when they,0.31476176
do it's beautiful but the focus always remains on clay it's always told from her,0.07554295
point of view the camera just kind of sits back and watches this it becomes,0.09594955
detached from this reality and allows us to look in it feels like a documentary,0.08937776
at times because everyone while they're unknown actors we don't know any of these at,0.11214655
what you guys might but I didn't know any of these actors they're still so,0.07875484
good there are award-worthy this cast was incredible the kids were wonderful the emotion was,0.10655665
just constantly in your face but not in your face to where it was annoying,0.6702436
it was in your face because you can't help but to get emotional watching everyone,0.28265485
go through these tragedies and then the beauty inside of it and finding things to,0.09866514
make you happy at a time of either loss or sadness there are beautiful themes,0.10966164
within here so many layers to this movie that's why I said before I can,0.060482673
actually settle on whether or not it belongs in my top 10 top 5 top,0.07924916
3 I have to see the film again because while I do truly believe it's,0.035814755
the best made film of the year I don't necessarily know if it's my favorite,0.051536184
I don't know if it has that rewatch ability but regardless that takes nothing away,0.1095551
from how well-made I think the film is because once again I think this is,0.059551965
the most well-made movie of 2018 Netflix congratulations you did it and anyone who tells,0.07583537
me oh this is a Netflix movie they're not going to get nominated for an,0.07454414
Oscar because it's a film of string on the streaming platen if you think this,0.1282397
doesn't deserve to get nominated because it's on Netflix just get out you don't belong,0.22993302
in this industry you don't deserve to have a place in film criticism you don't,0.14869131
even belong on YouTube go home shave your head stick in the toilet and flush,0.6177608
it just keep flushing it until the water just keeps filling up and then you,0.121453196
remove your head and you're like wow it does deserve to get nominated for an,0.69542736
Oscar nothing I said made sense but I'm angry I've just been seeing people online,0.09260293
that are saying oh this doesn't deserve to get nominated because it's on Netflix to,0.10786354
piss off anyway let's talk about the negatives to Romo I really don't have very,0.60137373
many because the filmmaking was almost perfect from a technical aspect it's all just some,0.06065821
of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen the cinematography I'm a big cinematography guy,0.15456742
so I love all of that where are the negatives Austin get into the negatives,0.05697828
the only thing I have to say about this movie that really bothered me is,0.12577412
the first hour was very slow now I do usually complain about movies being slow,0.12726922
it's usually my big critique but I think the reason that it bothers me so,0.0865805
much right now is because I was so in love with the second hour of,0.07486283
the film and I was so in with these characters I just didn't feel that,0.06160074
way about the first half I still think it's beautiful I still think it's amazing,0.108772084
I just wanted to be a little bit more onboard and less Hospital and I,0.13349707
thought it was going to be and also I'll say this this does not apply,0.068795726
to me but for someone who is watching this movie that doesn't love like the,0.100649774
artsy fartsy aspects of a film they don't enjoy artistic elements and they're not really,0.23265609
into the super realistic style movies if you don't like following a family on a,0.085741326
journey if you're in it for say action or something that you think is going,0.09468042
to happen towards the end that's like oh my gosh it's the most mind-blowing moment,0.31478593
of 2018 I don't know if you're going to love Romo I don't know if,0.14872736
you're going to appreciate it as much as I do and that's okay you don't,0.1527208
have to appreciate it like I do you can have a completely different opinion for,0.043914378
me I then Roma did everything that I needed it to do and more it's,0.12636909
so bit of the fact that it's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen,0.110597715
in the last decade is an incredible incredible feat and that's one of the reasons,0.06606962
why I love it so much all of those things being said that one minor,0.0835814
critique is keeping Roma away from a perfect score for me and I did not,0.07998913
anticipate giving this movie this high of a score twenty five minutes into the movie,0.108336106
but when that thing was over and I was wiping the water out of my,0.14588045
I'm not afraid to tell you guys that listen I don't get super emotional during,0.16469306
movies a lot of the time I get emotional but I don't show it I,0.07550097
showed it this time I was sitting on my couch thankfully by myself just sitting,0.13574997
there with tears coming out of my eyes because it was so so beautiful Roma,0.2487795
is a feat it's monumental and that is why I'm going to give this movie,0.07624616
as close to perfect as I ever thought a 98% the highest score I've ever,0.067936674
given a movie on Netflix one of the highest scores I have given all year,0.050047565
Roma is absolutely incredible and while it may not be my favorite of the year,0.080070876
it's absolutely the best and most well-made movie of 2018 thank you guys so much,0.06250664
for watching this video thank you for watching my channel still have a lot coming,0.06877664
out later today I'm actually going to watch the mule right now here in about,0.24841043
ten minutes and then I have a video of Titan's coming out but tomorrow is,0.07038514
what you guys really care about that is Aquaman Saturday probably around 10:00 or 11:00,0.08495069
p.m. be on the lookout for that Eastern Standard Time you guys are the absolute,0.10341339
