acting like a wanker bit of an intro no big deal he's a short synopsis of Mad Max fury road in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken to rebels just might be able to restore order max a man of action and a few words and furiosa a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland so let's get right to the [ __ ] [ __ ] everyone's arguing about there's been a bunch of articles and conversations online with dudes having a [ __ ] meltdown because they believe furiosa Shelley's the Ron's character is the protagonist conversely there's been a bunch of articles and conversations online with Sheila's going max is in the main character anyone with either of these perspectives is not paying attention and is likely already entering the cinema with their own gender baggage and disgruntlement put your egos in the [ __ ] trashcan [ __ ] cuz both perspectives are wrong this is a dual protagonists story a type of storytelling that i believe is as hard to execute as an ensemble movie Max and furiosa need one another I need you here to any blokes out there go oh oh but that's gets told what to do occasionally he doesn't get to come up with all the plans it's not a real man again you're not paying attention the whole emotionally-charged plot together modern Joe's wives out of the Citadel would have gone to [ __ ] without max he's also responsible for the third act plan to [ __ ] an overthrown revolutionize the Citadel so don't undermine him with your [ __ ] oh but furiosa's bored dialog big [ __ ] deal buddy art imitates life Sheila's [ __ ] talk Maxie old boy is still an archetypical 80s action hero he's [ __ ] he's a man of few words he's a lion wolf at heart he's highly skilled with physical prowess he's an emotional wasteland like the setting of the film and he's got a haunted broken man past no one's taken that [ __ ] away from you Tom Hardy also kicks the roll in the dick he's sensational his interpretation of the mad in Max is deranged mentally ill and herein lies where max needs furiosa furiosa is brilliant because yes she's tough and she can fight like a man but you know that's a rip off you've got to be tough as nails to survive in this post-apocalyptic world it would be illogical if you were not she's brilliant because her emotions and humanity are in check and that's what max needs because he's a [ __ ] scattered with the wind so the building blocks of trust are perfectly placed and they grow together throughout the film dual protagonists quit bitching and getting in your [ __ ] skulls it's brilliant hardly any critics ever talk about what a film is about what a writer and/or director we're trying to say and it's a massive disservice to proper artists with this film everyone is [ __ ] themselves over the action effects and stunts fair enough they're excellent done here's what it was about [ __ ] power equality survival trust maturity and independence power is visually represented in the cars a hundred and thirty cars were made for this film the main antagonist immortan joe his car looks like a egocentric thrown on wheels because he is power he thinks of himself as a God in a dystopian world where you would be lucky to have one of anything he is a bloke that is as two or three or in the case of his wives five of everything he is the greedy [ __ ] that controls the resources so he is power but by the end we hope that thing too will arise which is equality now don't get along or with your gender [ __ ] again it's equality between the human race the rich and the poor the powerful and the powerless the only way to ensure the survival of the human species in this world is with equality Fein three survival survival is still crucial for a mad mad story and no one is depriving anyone of this Mad Max mentions in the beginning of the film and if you don't see it from that point on again you are not paying attention there are four main resources you need in this world for survival guzzoline blood become a bloody blood bag water and mother's milk yes fellas you grew up sucking on titties with Adam you'd be gone as I guess if I want to be mushy I could say there's a fifth which is your interaction with humans relationships and stuff like that if you know if you don't have human action a human interaction you end up down a bit nutty like poor old max maturity and independence now this is fun these things are located in the wives of immortan joe and also in the character of knox played by nicholas hoult aka that kid from the movie about a boy all them years ago the wives have been sheltered they've been shut away only to be used as breeders by a Morton Joe so he can soon have a son that will take over being [ __ ] of Australia so the wives don't know [ __ ] they have to learn how to do stuff on the run furiosa has got to help them by yelling at him whether it's fixing the war rig or loaning a [ __ ] gun and these tough old ducks that are once lived in the green lands they're gonna help the Sheila's you are a bit as well Nux has also lived a life quiet sheltered by immortan joe so like the wives they got to learn to be their own women max has to learn to become his own man so their character journeys and things go hand in hand and I'm just stoked the B characters had some substance to be honest I also find it fascinating I guess there's a little theme in here somewhere too that George Miller the director was a doctor before he made Mad Max and the inspiration for Mad Max was because he dealt with a lot of [ __ ] road trauma accidents and he wanted to make a film rooted in Australia's car culture so knucks is the representation of that this young ram heads trying to impress the older blokes like a Morton Joe trying to prove himself through reckless behavior overall I love a good suspenseful chase film and I think the challenge is always to have the characters grow and develop on the move I think this film succeeded big-time in in accomplishing that it ticks a lot of boxes I think the last chase filled my life was probably apocalyptic directed by Mel Gibson how's that for synchronicity anyway I hope you've enjoyed this review I
