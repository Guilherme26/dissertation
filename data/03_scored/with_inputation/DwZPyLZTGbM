so this is probably the most hyped movie this year when it comes to the,0.07603132
award season but from the first moment I heard about it it seemed boring to,0.08036534
me that was pretty much my initial reaction to it oh this looks boring and,0.15498103
that's just me being honest here and it doesn't really matter to me how much,0.07651057
hype or praise the movie gets if it doesn't appeal to me on a gut,0.15081789
level I'm not gonna be that excited to watch it that being said there's still,0.09564215
a pretty good chance I like it when I do sit down and watch it,0.23831096
and I fully expected to be proven wrong here I expected to end up liking,0.10016659
it well you can probably tell where this is going yeah I didn't like it,0.073123544
and I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it about five minutes into it because,0.09169214
the title sequence sets the tone for this thing pretty much perfectly if you like,0.08184445
the title sequence you'll love this movie and I definitely didn't I mean during the,0.06448345
first scene after the titles I just went oh for sake because at that point,0.065505676
I knew exactly what I was in for and I just had no interest so,0.06255889
what's the deal here it's a black-and-white movie by Alfonso Cuaron said in Mexico in,0.19514887
the 70s the same guy who made children of men and gravity the first one,0.15355605
is great the other one visually stunning but story-wise kind of meh but this one's,0.052098274
a bit different this one is about a maid who lives with this wealthier family,0.081380196
and she seems kinda like a part of the family actually they treat her very,0.09054967
well and the kids well her and it's almost as much about the family itself,0.06815951
as it is about her except the stories told entirely through her and the movie,0.079089224
follows her and I mean I have nothing against the core story here or the,0.07971095
characters or how its shot or any of that Quarren knows what he's doing it's,0.31368503
more about the pacing and how it's put together and presented this thing moves at,0.049951643
a glacial pace and the thing is there's nothing complex going on here it's a,0.07529622
very straightforward story this is a 90-minute movie if I ever saw one but it's,0.045404762
actually 2 hours 15 minutes I mean I could tell you everything important that happens,0.10397229
in this movie in about two sentences now I'm obviously not gonna do that there's,0.072236665
some new ones there but it's essentially a movie about changes challenges and moving on,0.047411315
and my main issue was that I just didn't care about anything that was going,0.09194608
on not necessarily because the stuff itself wasn't compelling but because of the way it,0.063286774
was presented the presentation board the living out of me and I love dramas I,0.106384255
don't mind a swell movie and I don't mind long movies either but the pacing,0.098191775
needs to be good and it needs to be either really interesting or really entertaining,0.09151612
and this just wasn't I mean I just reviewed the house that Jack built which,0.060836375
is longer than this and it's a slow burn too but I liked it because,0.11217454
for the most of it it was either interesting or entertaining and to me this,0.08185089
wasn't however that last act the last 45 minutes or so I didn't hate I,0.086978756
actually kind of liked it at least I liked some aspects of it because it,0.0889589
felt like an actual movie it had some momentum it moved forward things happened I,0.10253404
even got a bit invested in what was going on unfortunately the first hour and,0.10221505
a half didn't have that and I can't remember being so utterly bored by a,0.05845299
movie in a long time and in the interest of being completely transparent here I,0.07821048
seriously considered shutting it off and I told myself no one knows you're gonna review,0.15409765
this no one cares just shut it off and this misery now but I stuck,0.5669901
with it and well I don't know if it was worth it but at least,0.11136088
it got better so there's that and now I'm sitting here trying not to be,0.08034576
too harsh because this thing obviously struck a chord with people but the bottom line,0.1776211
is I thought this thing was incredibly boring for most of the runtime and that's,0.21919201
just the truth and that's just my opinion so take that for what it's worth,0.10917083
but it also means I don't see how I could possibly recommend it so maybe,0.095026374
