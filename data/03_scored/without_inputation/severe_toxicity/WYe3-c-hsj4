what's up guys it's will back again today's review is the newest Pixar film Coco,0.0685964
Coco directed by Lee Unkrich the director of Toy Story 3 takes place in Mexico,0.039316345
and primarily follows a young boy named Miguel who has a passion for music despite,0.042851795
the fact that his family forbids him from playing it an attempt to follow his,0.01702737
passion but Gael goes the search of his great-great-grandfather's guitar so he can use it,0.04652361
to enter a talent show however once Miguel locates the guitar he ends up in,0.02737896
a mysterious world known as the land of the dead Miguel joined by his dog,0.16864601
Dante and his travel companion Hector goes in search of his great-great-grandfather and Nestor de,0.034198422
la Cruz so that he can meet him and return Miguel back to the land,0.20113623
of the living and the rest of the film has spent watching Miguel attempt to,0.009063792
navigate his way through the land of the dead well he also attempts we figure,0.08407921
out the truth of his family and his love for music okay so Coco was,0.05884281
a film that was almost certainly expected to be great because Pixar very rarely misses,0.036969576
the mark there's a few times where the work hasn't been great most particularly in,0.03369022
the Cars franchise which everyone knows about but generally Pixar is expected to be the,0.015307872
leader of the cinema animation industry and the bar has already set pretty high for,0.03122106
most of their movies it sound like I was really blown away by the trailers,0.060268965
for Coco I was definitely looking forward to seeing it but it wasn't like on,0.030237254
my most anticipated list of the year or anything honestly though it probably should have,0.011584173
been because this is one of the best films of the year thus far and,0.020783663
easily the best animated film of the year thus far best that I've seen at,0.021508712
least I think this movie offers what a lot of other Pixar films the past,0.03763609
offer it's something for everyone I think you can take your kid to this movie,0.06976579
and they'll certainly have a great time with it you could take your significant other,0.021559266
to this movie and they'll have a good time with it how you could even,0.051016923
take your grandma to this movie and she'd enjoy it too I think it balances,0.22750092
all the things you'd expect to see out of a great animated film and turns,0.07094383
all that into a really really well-rounded experience I think this is what Pixar does,0.070226766
better than almost every one of their competitors I think a decent amount of adults,0.031537022
are hesitant to go out and see an animated film because the primary target audience,0.03364366
is generally kids and while that's still the case with Pixar films films like Coco,0.03815427
will still get a lot of adults in the theatre because they offer really rich,0.025106026
and emotional stories that carry adult themes as well I'll just let you know ahead,0.015955094
of time the Coco is a very emotional film I mean I know the ending,0.08296237
especially almost got me teary-eyed and usually pretty resilient with that kind of stuff I,0.065301076
do know for certain that plenty of people in the feeder with me were crying,0.11751866
because the lady next to me was and I noticed several others were as well,0.07071368
but it's not like it's gut-wrenchingly sad it's sort of a happy sadness it's more,0.027125524
emblematic of excellent storytelling than anything else this is very much a journey that you,0.06966136
go on with Miguel and his companions and by the end of it the characters,0.09263547
grow so much which is exactly what you're looking for out of this kind of,0.041420322
film I think Coco separates itself from the recent pack of animated films because does,0.039774656
not just feel good kid content it's actually a lot more than that and this,0.027593149
story will resonate with people a lot longer than any generic animated film would but,0.028056115
this isn't to say there isn't feel-good kid stuff too there definitely is but it's,0.020603398
executed really well and never feels like it excludes the older audiences I think the,0.3046272
way Coco approaches its humor specifically is actually really impressive because it doesn't necessarily favor,0.013553782
one demographic over another it's kid driven first and foremost yes but there's definitely something,0.02653484
here for everyone in the comedy department as well as other departments I found this,0.029364532
film to have a ton of heart but I also found it to be very,0.016815178
clever comedic Lee as well not a lot of kid films balance the two so,0.039893724
proficiently but Coco is yet another Pixar film that pulls it off honest I think,0.049207624
Coco is one of their best films to date because of how well this movie,0.036953613
is balanced but from a technical perspective I think Coco really pushes the batteries of,0.01608148
the genre some of the animation and this film is breathtakingly good and I really,0.019086115
do love how each Pixar film looks better and better I mean this movie is,0.059773404
so colorful and so beautiful to look at that it's almost worth going to see,0.03439997
just for that I think the land of the Dead is honestly one of the,0.2254988
most beautiful things I've seen in a film this year this is just insane animation,0.09867201
and considering Coco is at least partially about music that's one of the big themes,0.0243404
of the movie I think you'd be really upset if the music in Coco sucked,0.46839273
but it doesn't it's actually pretty damn awesome actually do you want to give kudos,0.10926306
to Michael Giacchino for creating an amazing soundtrack year the music and Coco is so,0.01874155
versatile because there's moments where it's soothing and moments where it's exciting and energizing I,0.02000806
think that it's really really great and this is probably another category where Coco ranks,0.019863049
among the best of the year before we wrap up I just want to say,0.042529847
that the ending of this film is so great it not only makes the whole,0.04392673
journey feel worth it but it provides such a satisfying closure to the story of,0.019219816
these characters it's really heartwarming stuff and hit me in the fields way harder than,0.15394278
I expected - and that's how you know you're watching a great film I think,0.021591196
ultimately Coco is a movie that excels at basically everything you'd hope it would and,0.11411026
because of that I really do feel you should go out and see this one,0.09975293
whether you're a big fan of animated films or not I thought it had a,0.04907858
beautiful story about family and excellent balance of comedy and drama amazing visuals and some,0.021096298
awesome music and as expected honestly there's nothing bad I can say about this movie,0.027346365
I'm gonna give Coco a ten out of ten and recommend you go out and,0.111357726
catch this one in theatres you won't regret it so did you guys see Coco,0.041105025
yet what did you think of it and if not let me know why not,0.033985563
and also let me know your favorite Pixar movie I'm gonna go with Toy Story,0.03678665
3 but there's so many good options that's all for now that this is willfox,0.037269574
