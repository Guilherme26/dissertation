a few weeks ago I had the pleasure of seeing one of my most anticipated,0.025031526
films of the year ladybird ladybird is a film about a high school girl named,0.03510174
ladybird played by Saoirse Ronan and about her relationship with her mother played by Laurie,0.18485454
Metcalf and how it's affected when ladybird meets boys when she's moving after college and,0.078854196
a bunch of other small things I'm gonna cut to the chase and say that,0.17712776
I really really liked this movie it's really rare to see a dramedy that balances,0.080368154
comedy and drama so flawlessly this movie blends the two together in an almost invisible,0.040550925
way the movie is hilarious and sad but not a depressing way it's more of,0.051751953
a it gets you to understand the emotions that the characters are getting across while,0.013583715
at the same time making you laugh again the humor is super clever and very,0.025978083
consistent usually in comedies it'll be really funny and then it'll get really dramatic and,0.029909318
then it'll go back to being funny and it would be some really good parts,0.15099137
and some really bad parts but this movie is hilarious all the way through I,0.059397575
don't want to spoil anything but there are some extremely clever and unpredictable cuts throughout,0.029079834
this thing that are super sad but also hilarious which is kind of confusing at,0.025216447
times but it ends up working really well it's super interesting because throughout the film,0.018944431
I'm trying to figure out if I'm just a jerk for laughing at certain things,0.41904363
or if it's actually supposed to be that funny as for the drama it works,0.024571884
insanely well the film does a great job at making you actually feel for these,0.039354924
characters and not like they're just people on a screen it makes you feel like,0.03445984
you're in that world and that these people have feelings and it's that aspect of,0.04326554
the film that makes it super convincing as for the actual plot it's actually a,0.016703427
pretty cliche idea it's really just about a girl that's going off to college and,0.077191904
sort of her relationship with her mother and swear the troubles that come with that,0.11117148
but it's done in such an interesting and unique way that honestly I've never seen,0.028654115
before I almost got a bit of a Napoleon Dynamite vibe coming from it because,0.056341056
it's able to get this high school story across in a very interesting and non,0.06007872
cliche way I mean it was able to take a scene where one student gets,0.05139076
an A and the other gets a C and it made it convincing for once,0.091237254
usually those scenes I'm just kind of like yeah okay but this one I actually,0.03505784
felt for the characters I owe a lot of this to Greta Gerwig the director,0.0303204
who by the way is very at her job considering this is her directorial debut,0.038066465
and she did a pretty much perfect job I mean throughout the entire film the,0.05254352
direction is on point I mean there's not a single flaw with what she did,0.056325756
the whole thing is super exciting and fresh there's an adult and for the acting,0.033251867
I mean Saoirse Ronan Laurie McAfee locust hedges the whole cast did a really fantastic,0.1459945
job probably one of my highlights is Laurie McCaffrey gave a phenomenal performance as the,0.04171899
mother I mean every time she was on the screen I was completely drawn into,0.0447775
the film and on top of that I want to give a shout out to,0.044228725
beanie Feldstein I've never heard of her prior to this I looked her up and,0.11974437
she really hasn't had that much experience before this film and she was by far,0.032394443
the funniest part of the movie I felt like I connected to her and I,0.047603868
thought that she was hilarious I mean it was she was just a great character,0.032963175
overall in reality every character felt so much like they belong in this world each,0.06021309
one felt so important and vital to the story which is so rare like I,0.0332053
said earlier to a film about high school that is also a dramedy I mean,0.12353125
it all just felt really natural in terms of cinematography this film is just beautiful,0.039378207
there's nothing incredibly striking or out-of-this-world about it but it works really well with the,0.052817576
story and doesn't make you feel you know distracted or like it's anything more than,0.014900113
what it is the whole aesthetic of the film is just very pleasing it's very,0.035128348
dark red kind of golden I don't know despite all of what I've said I,0.099077776
do understand that there are probably going to be some people that don't like this,0.03364898
movie for one their major plot points in this film that are addressed within the,0.0268069
matter of seconds now that's usually done for the sake of humor and it actually,0.019138664
works very well but I can see why some people might not like that very,0.04998323
much I know a lot of people like a big buildup in a super dramatic,0.15818399
climax but this film isn't like that if anything this film makes fun of dramatic,0.071974866
movies well at the same time being a dramatic film very well on top of,0.056887835
that there are a few parts of the film that don't come full circle necessarily,0.028634826
if you want to avoid spoilers I suggest skipping to this part of the video,0.05632243
I mean for one near the end of the film we figure out that lady's,0.061568066
father is depressed we figure out that the drama teacher is seeking help and there's,0.026161008
a scene where lady's father runs into her brother while applying for the same job,0.111756176
I mean for that last one I don't think necessarily needed an end it kind,0.051830444
of spoke for itself but for the others it would have been nice to learn,0.043614097
a little bit more about these characters and where this would have gone but again,0.0270916
as is I thought that the film worked incredibly well without it I thought I'd,0.0076356432
kind of fit with the overall story that you know it's life is kind of,0.04628747
unpredictable and there are loose ends and you don't know what's gonna happen next and,0.062427483
you know it's it works besides that this film is absolutely amazing it's stunning the,0.040606137
writing is great it's hilarious it's sad it's basically everything you would want in a,0.042639602
dramedy to be honest it might be my favorite film of the year if not,0.028407998
