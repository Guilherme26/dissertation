you know I had a dream that one day someone would actually make a film,0.09077428
about Martin Luther King jr. and handle it in a very truthful accurate and respectful,0.043125853
manner and it looks like that dream has come true hey guys the black corner,0.25037047
guy today I'm here to review the film Selma now the film Selma takes place,0.026068548
in a very tumultuous time in US history where segregation was alive and well in,0.07013364
the south and it follows the demonstrations and peaceful protests by Martin Luther King jr.,0.04628747
and how he got it all together none of my knowledge and I could be,0.038361806
wrong about this but I don't think there has ever been a theatrical film made,0.029307326
about Martin Luther King jr. sure there's been a lot of TV movies TV specials,0.06985958
documentaries and miniseries about the man but never a full-on theatrical film about Martin Luther,0.062500656
King and it could be because with all of his contributions to the world and,0.021488093
countless of good things he has done to sum it all up in a two-hour,0.0453316
long movie I just wouldn't do the man any justice so I guess nobody wanted,0.04393937
to attack that but seeing Selma I think they really picked a very monumental time,0.19753426
in Maher Luther King's life to show on the big screen and what I really,0.12586871
appreciate about this film is that it does it takes place after all the things,0.050959054
that we really remember Maher Luther King 4 it takes place after his speech at,0.05967562
Washington DC it takes place after he won his Nobel Peace Prize it takes place,0.04970319
after all the major events that we've come to know about Martin Luther King and,0.02613174
it's like the events afterwards this takes place I believe in 1965 in Selma Alabama,0.020668587
and I really praised the movie for doing that they easily could have been like,0.029027283
this is the life of Martin Luther King we're gonna go through all of it,0.05894525
and we're gonna end on like the big speech though they actually address one key,0.049063947
moment in Maher Luther King's life basically they pulled a Lincoln with this movie we're,0.07581697
focused on one major event in the man's life and really showed it to us,0.0833841
and in my honest and humble opinion I believe that this was the perfect time,0.036480002
for a film like Selma to be released especially after all the events that have,0.020294754
occurred in the last few years because people need to be reminded of the struggle,0.031109309
of the trials and tribulations that the people face back in the 1950s and 60s,0.041172206
they need to be reminded of the people that sacrifice their lives to give us,0.26187953
the rights that we have today and people need to be inspired to make a,0.016678149
change and needless to say I thought that someone was a great and fantastic film,0.063881576
and one that I truly respect in the fact that it doesn't really follow the,0.017520938
same trend as other films that talk about the civil rights movement before it I,0.0411609
mean yes they do shine a light on the civil rights movement and they do,0.041210122
show it as a justification to it and I found that so intriguing I was,0.033821262
hoping that this film could stand out amongst the other civil rights type films and,0.0646013
I think that it truly does and it stands out for many reasons the biggest,0.04225047
one being its portrayal of the man that was Martin Luther King jr. they do,0.04118418
not put this guy on a pedestal they do not treat him as a God,0.27022147
among men as I've seen in TV specials and heard in documentaries they show dr.,0.028526401
King for what he truly was he was a man he had faults he had,0.107924715
a lot of faults that were addressed in the film he had doubts there was,0.0190329
a scene where he's in the jail cell he's talking to one of the people,0.14392911
that I can guessing is his friend and he's talking about you know is what,0.013383495
we're doing really going to help is it really going to change you know we,0.026121762
could get a man to sit down in a dining table but he can't pay,0.20530628
for the burger at the diner he had hesitations this was same where he's standing,0.030676274
on the bridge he's wondering whether I should push forward or if he should just,0.12640153
turn back he was a man and I loved how the film humanized dr. King,0.11781467
they in put him on a pedestal that is the most perfect representation of King,0.05380737
I've seen in a movie thus far and that is all attributed to the excellent,0.022722673
performance done by this guy I cannot pronounce his last name and I would hate,0.23435658
to butcher it so I'll put his name right here but I'm gonna call him,0.41041544
David oh this guy he did such a phenomenal job portraying dr. Martin Luther King,0.050550632
now at first scared because his voice didn't really capture the voice that was Martin,0.031339463
Luther King Jr's voice I've heard Martin Luther King's voice so many times I could,0.030148784
tell it from a mile away but when I heard his voice didn't really sound,0.021901837
like him and I was a little scared and hesitant to really see him as,0.06790461
Martin Luther King but as the film continued I just got sucked into his performance,0.5597236
especially when he is preaching to the crowd I felt the presence of Martin Luther,0.022233099
King right there I could feel it radiating out of him I hope he gets,0.10434603
nominated I don't know if he'll win but if he gets nominated I'm gonna be,0.049959283
so happy because his performance is truly Oscar worthy one of the best performances I've,0.02309584
seen of the year though riding in the film was excellent and I loved how,0.01170058
they addressed all the struggles all the pressure and all the conflict that dr. King,0.025920875
had to face during the Selma protest you would think that a film called Selma,0.047884576
would only focus on the town of Selma and what Martin Luther King jr. did,0.035918586
in that town but no the film also addresses what he was dealing with meeting,0.013695466
with the president in Washington DC and trying to push the Voting Rights Act it,0.0220229
shows his marital struggle to keep his marriage alive because there's a lot of issues,0.2002848
going on right there I love that the film addressed this because I've heard about,0.019741986
for years but I always thought no one would ever see that port in film,0.029208213
and they did they addressed it in this film to actually put it on screen,0.055506915
and gave it so much attention and focus I love that now although I felt,0.054157257
like the film's representation of the march and the brutality by the police was done,0.23271546
very well and unfiltered I felt like they kind of withheld on showing a little,0.08050252
bit more of the gruesomeness of that scene I felt like it was probably more,0.15475763
gruesome and more damaging than what we actually saw but for the scene that were,0.16683072
there they were brutal and they were really hard to watch it was just gut-wrenching,0.07540921
to think that people would actually do like this and it did happen and the,0.040322766
sad part is it continues to happen I was like the fact that they gave,0.032407083
dr. King a sense of humor I mean there are some scenes where he's talking,0.024788069
to his buddies and it just feels like a natural conversation and they're just joking,0.040567555
around I wish the more scenes like that but of course it's all about the,0.024092287
events that are going down the struggles that he's facing but it would have been,0.021076344
nice to see more downtime that dr. King had with his friends I mean those,0.112702064
scenes were really well done it really captures the normal life that dr. King sort,0.03128292
of lived now and again I guess the last thing I want to talk about,0.031949434
and praise about this film was the acting I already praised David OHS performance of,0.044731606
dr. King but everybody else also did a really good job and there's just so,0.012490818
many notable performances like I thought Tom Wilkinson did a really good job at portraying,0.03909218
lyndon b johnson i felt like he captured him perfectly overall guys i love this,0.0939552
film this film really touched me it really spoke to me this is probably one,0.098292194
of the best films about the civil rights movement i probably have ever seen it,0.042737383
if i had seen it in 2014 it definitely would have been in my top,0.040345382
ten of the year and it would have been number one that's how great it,0.019709392
was all the performances were solid they were genuine everything about this film I just,0.02701843
felt like clicked and I could not take my eyes off the screen I was,0.073633835
in trans by the story at the events that were occurring on screen and the,0.008624772
performances that each and every actor and actress in this film gave it is an,0.025255028
amazing and phenomenal film and I really hope that you guys go and check it,0.06740971
out because it is getting the highest grade it could ever get on this channel,0.051505834
that's the 5 out of 5 but it's not an epic masterpiece it's just a,0.017421825
masterpiece it's an excellent work of film and I just loved it and in recommending,0.022667464
films that are very similar to summer you guys should definitely check out Malcolm X,0.027178738
starring Denzel Washington as the militant leader he does a really good job at conveying,0.040845603
and capturing the man that was Malcolm X in fact he earned an Academy Award,0.02366923
nomination for his portrayal that's how good it was I would also recommend that you,0.06350974
check out Lincoln which also has a very similar set up and then it takes,0.012143592
place in a very crucial moment in this very important person's life but anyway I,0.06350442
would truly love to know what you guys thought about this film if you have,0.07581963
seen it did you love it as much as I did did you feel like,0.029598678
it was a mask Peace in an excellent film or did it just not live,0.13283318
up to what you were hoping and he felt like it was emotionally manipulative and,0.079265945
totally bias and let me know who is your favorite social activists somebody that fights,0.071466
injustice in the world comment below let me know and I know I took this,0.044554
review a little bit more seriously but the film called for a series of you,0.05216902
