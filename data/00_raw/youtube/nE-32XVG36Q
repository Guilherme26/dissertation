hina a Monken over my classic reviews but people like all-time favorite movies give it a V watch and then come with you it and this video I'm talking about Seven Samurai which is the really classic 1950s film that established and creates so many tropes that it is now pretty much a cornerstone of cinema it's a firm which is input so many it's affirmative you'll be made at least twice in America it's a film which is a big deal and it's a film which was really really matters for the history and fabric of cinema it's a film whose story is very simple it's just a village full of farmers who were going to be attacked by bandits in a few weeks so the higher summer samurai to protect the village from the ban this pretty simple story and although the film was three and a half hours long it's all those mer films that he's never born it doesn't feel like freeing our powers at all it's a very very interesting film that it's just so just watchable you can dissect Amazon graphic artistic lenses who it's experimental does it really seven son right is a story best film it is not this deep earth house movie it's not this experimental movies not a thong style it's a film of a simple story a story based film and I think of all the films that are just stories there isn't one better craft to December sunrise late in history sever time I might be the best crafted movie of all time I'm not saying that there wasn't films I prefer more but a more flawed I'm not even saying that there isn't better mid movies because there is but I think that better movies that exist of like art movies I think something is just a story and I think even at me was it a better made don't tell their stories well after the Sun right Samsung might tell its story perfectly and everything aware it is fantastic he made the editing cuts on action at perfect moments the camerawork is dynamic he's roaming it's moving the action is sometimes slow sometimes fast naturalistic controlled everything is so perfectly aligned the story is so well developed that hope does God feel really good arcs it's really really well put together the other questions I can levy on it are best if we just knit picks and really really mine and it picks at that so let's just move where for now let's look at one of the things that's so great about is just the characters the characters here are iconic like absolutely iconic I think there's no question here that some of them have gone down in legend the leaves I'm like kambei is this a jade humble dignified samurai who has seen a lot of death he's take a fight in and throughout the course of the movie he would sit more fight in and I think he kind of is the Sun even the glue the whole summer summer together he's the character who we always respect and we respect the fact that he sees this lost not was a good thing even if it's for a noble purpose but really this damn character in some way is kikuchiyo who is one of the first characters ever put to cinema and he is one of the best actors want the best arc in cinema the couch it's a fantastic character he starts off the movie being kind of a laughable fake samurai he's not excited by the others he's a triangle among the circles he's not the some way that they respect he's someone who's just a fake his swords oversized his papers a wrong he's a liar and his lover born is ridiculous and everyone makes a mockery of him who thought the film they learned to respect it by the end of the film he has reached the level of Bentley penis I might accepted as of summer like they expected or something like he gets the same treatment as a song like he is a samurai despite the fact that he starts off to be such a laughable fake and there's two moments that define him that ever I mean with best moments in the film at one point kikuchiyo holds a crying child while a house behind him burns and I think he at that point he realizes how far he's come from what he started and I said really keep one for him on the sudden who he is and what how he's changed and I think they have a really great point for the future it's a speech midway through the film well he bakes a samurai for their snobbery towards a farmers or for their I can give at the farmers and I think it's the best moment in a film thought of so many fantastic moments it's not my her Cuchillo really reveals who he is like not just in the literal sense in a very much he reveals how he feels he the facade has gone and he perfected something right for the society they leave it for the responsibility in the oppression that goes on the front of samurai just looking down all those lower than them and for the idea that the son might have sought wonderful and I think coochie is kind of revelation here that he doesn't find all of them expecting this I'm right he's really kind of interesting because that's something he seems to want to be and it's such a fantastic moment the bricks apart the fell I think it's a moment well look the violet world around them we see the clarity this is a phone with a bandit sort of bad guys but there's a point to myth about how the bandits and the Sun might both leave the cycles of violence that oppressed the peasants it's not just the pundits who have long in this world and so kikuchiyo lay in that bear in such a brutal honest fashion the bricks the heart the other characters is such a fantastic moment in a film that really has so many others but isn't really count if I were to fill about groups individual don't do you mean much to this family to feel about a group dynamic so for example the titular taro something I must be aren't really developed or define but what is define is how everyone function doing a group we know how the team works even if we don't know how individuals work and I think what's really important is sometimes I feel about groups we're curious how I die max his film he has the groups of characters that move and they even moved he ever unify all split apart and separate and coach always all of our movement I mean they're film exploring natural movement main wind but he constantly muses clouds and he constantly uses groups it's about group mentality it's not about individuals in this film so it's a film where we have peasant versus some my versus bandits everyone is a separate group never one is expected to for those world you want to be a Bundy or a farmer or peasant over some way or wife you know meant to be anything else and so this is a film where everyone goes into predefined roles in the society as soon as we see this quite okay we see it wouldn't character who fixed time I will defile his daughter who's a farmer and sir he gave me her not kind of emphasizes an ugly truth to society when defined in a way it shows the follows a feudalism that follows of classifies of privilege it shows how bad they can be and so Seven Samurai really is a film about the group mentality it's about how people work a collectivist that it's not about individuality and that's kind of something that makes it a bit different to films of just like a singular action hero the other thing is that this is also a hair of those two very traditional hair and narrative the the seven song right don't necessarily strike whose heroes in heavenly but what they have is a moral character they're fighting to protect one village it's a very small scale story just seven song with a woman village it's almost gotten difficult in a way I think because if I was a judge I caught your consciousness it has become a myth really the story that Seven Samurai you've saved a village for no reward and great cost because almost in Heroes is that they're more character says that even though there is no cost and their glory to this they will fight to the death then they do fight to quite literally a bad end for a lot of them fill all of these variations on this idea the actions are always seen and when it is seen there's often a lot associated with it fighting isn't always novel and fighting does lead to death if item does lead to suffering and as much as the fighting here is justified because you've got to see if the peasants and the bandits there's certainly a task Forte what keys interesting I fixed I'm saying right it's just a master view like obviously everyone on planet earth who's seen this film thinks is a masterpiece all they should do at least because it's so obviously is it among films it is just perfectly put together it's a story which is really what Paul is never once boring it's fantastically develop the characters are so likable and if they aren't like people they're interesting the story is simple which we call a mythos become an active everyone knows it it's inspired counts of us I mean America did the Magnificent Seven we make it's absolutely groundbreaking it's absolutely astonishing it's a film which holds up time and time again I watch it pretty much annually and every single time I love it it's a feminist just it's magnificent and I don't know what else it is to possibly say well Severus I'm like you don't want to love words like perfect around because in all honesty nothing is ever truly perfect but summer sign right you suppose it gets about as close to perfection as you can get given what it is it does it pretty much perfectly so yeah it my favorite a lot I know you know I'm not saying it is but there's very few that are objectively better put together I think there's Seven Samurai and it's just fantastic so yeah so something like obviously a classic I looked at your
