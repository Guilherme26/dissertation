one last time [Music] hey guys the last critic guy into Dana March third is a very very monumental day why you may ask what for two major reasons first this video you're watching right now is my 1,000th video yes thank you thank you thank you so much I never thought I would ever reach this milestone but hey here we are and thank you guys for sticking with me for 1,000 videos it must have been really painful and the second reason is I am reviewing the last film to star Hugh Jackman as Wolverine called Logan now Logan begins many years into the future where the mutant population has dwindled due to no new mutant births and possible mutant hunting we've all much older and weaker Wolverine who works as a limo driver in order to make some money to care for a sick and senile Xavier to a series of circumstances he encounters a young girl who is like him in many ways and now must protect her from an evil organization that wants to experiment on her and bring her to a safe haven up north slicing enemies along the way now i mentioned earlier this ends the file film 2 stars Hugh Jackman as the titular and iconic character Logan aka Wolverine it's also the final appearance of passive Stewart as Professor Xavier as he too stated that he's going to be retiring from the role after this film so Logan is basically an end of an arrow type film as we have seen these two portrayed these characters for close to 20 years and now it's all come to an end so there was no way that I was missing out on seeing Logan I grew up with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and I will be there for his last film and I was super excited the trailers are freaking awesome it's freakin rated R which got me really excited so we could see some really intense who are some a gritty action from Wolverine the type of action we've always wanted to see so I could not wait to see Logan and after watching the film what did I think about it well let's get into it shall we first thing worth mentioning about Logan was its action this is without a doubt the most gruesome action I have ever seen in a Wolverine film and it's exactly the kind of action we all have been waiting to see in a Wolverine film you guys remember that one spectacular action sequence in Xmen apocalypse we're Wolverine is mowing down guys left to right we'll take that one scene from x-men apocalypse and extend it by two hours that's the sort of high-octane action you get to witness in Logan it's exhilarating bloody and also fun to watch with so many awesome and gratifying kills I mean you got head piercings limbs flying everywhere blood spewing all over the place it's just over-the-top action goodness the acting is tremendous especially Hugh Jackman as Logan aka Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier no surprise there this was honestly the most challenging and riveting performance I've seen Hugh Jackman give as the character Logan / Wolverine and he has to portray a much older weaker and vulnerable Logan while still maintaining the reluctant hero persona as well as a sinister ferocity and in my opinion he pulled it off perfectly and I expect no less it was a near-perfect swan song for a character that has been his for 17 years and I will miss him dearly after this film Patrick Stewart's also try something new with his portrayal of Charles Xavier a more new approach to the character it says of the smart reasonable and collected professor figure that we have known in love for many years TC now mentally unstable and crass it was quite jarring to see to say the least I mean the once great Professor X brought down to a doddering old fool my heart did break but it made for one of the most memorable and emotional heart-wrenching performances in the entire film that is just neck-and-neck with Hugh Jackman's performance and a little girl that plays Laura was pretty good too a feisty little one she is you do not want to get on her bad side ever and it to go without saying that the actors as well as the characters that they play has convincing and dynamic chemistry with Logan and Charles being the strongest no surprise there I mean these two have been in almost every single x-men film together the story here is solid and engaging for the most part many high points many low points I enjoyed the journey aspects of the story there's a lot of great emotional things a lot of kick-ass action scenes it's a well told well structured and enthralling story and it had a very Western vibe to it throughout the entire film which makes sense given what type of story is and also a very very very fitting ending for a story like this and lastly all the technical aspects ranging from cinematography visual effects sounds and all that jazz were well done so it seems as though Logan was the perfect send-off for Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine character now we can ride triumphantly to the sunset right right right well actually I do have a couple issues with the film Logan and I feel like many of you have your Wolverine claws shooting out of your fists like what how could you find anything wrong this movie this movie's an edge of masterpiece Tony when you're talking about your nonsubscribers just like this video all you're a terrible person calm down listen to what I have to say and remember that overall I love this film it's a really really really enjoyable film but it is not without its flaws my biggest problem with this film was that there was way too much downside that ruins the overall flow of the pacing now look I completely understand that these downside moments are meant to give the audience some time with the characters as well as a break from the action scenes but some of these Delta moments stretch on for far too long like the first act with Logan Charles in this one mutant named Caliban living together in an abandoned smelting plant others just don't really add much to the characters that they really explore or develop these characters in these outside moments like a hotel scene with Charles Logan and Laura and then others were completely ineffectual and superfluous to the entire story like that entire segment were Logan Charles and Laura spend the night at farming families house what was the point of having that effect that entire scene felt eerily similar to the scene and x-men origins Wolverine hoovering say that mom potheads farming house and they end up buying the dust a multitude of these scenes could have easily been trimmed or completely removed they didn't need to be in the film the main antagonists work really that memorable nor were they all that threatening not to mention that they're just the same recycled evil corporation experimenting on mutants that we have seen of by the time and other x-men / wolverine films [Music] but I will give some credit to that one villain who constantly wore shades in the film and had that metal hand he has a flair of coolness to look that made him pretty interesting but as the film went on he was just relegated to mere henchman status boom and the last major problem I found with Logan was I wish they gave us more bonding moments between Logan and Laura and sure the film does give us a handful that were serviceable but not in the truly drive home that they built a strong deep and powerful connection throughout the entire film it was lacking to say the least now the next few points are just mere nitpicks they're not cons against the film they don't detract from the film but they did personally irritate me throughout one of the biggest ones is I wanted more explanation as to what happened to the other x-men now it's heavily implied that Charles had something to do with it but never explicitly told to us and I personally believe that at this point it would be nice to kind of get an explicit explanation as to what happened to all of our favorite x-men where are they are they still around it they could have explained a little bit more of that another significant and this is risk coming for me was the constant cussing throughout the film now far be it for me to complain that a film has too much cussing in it I mean I cuss way more than I should in my own videos and look I don't have a problem with excessive cursing in a film in fact I prefer it and thoroughly enjoy it as long as it comes off natural the problem here in Logan is that many of these scenes are laced with profanity come off as super force like they just have to throw in a and a kid here because they got an R rating which I'm grateful for I'm thankful that you finally gave us a or rated Wolverine film as they gave us some of the best action we've ever seen a Wolverine film but just because you're all rated doesn't mean that you have to cut every three to five seconds I mean as long as you do it now and again that's perfectly fine in fact it would be more effective also hearing Patrick Stewart's version of Charles Xavier cursing so much was just so weird and unsettling now Logan I understand as he's always been a character that's known to fly off the hinges you know go off the handle but with Xavier I always saw him as a man of intelligence integrity and elegance who wouldn't stoop to using such a vulgar and petty speech so to hear him cursing so much in this film I didn't know how to feel I was kind of taken aback like oh not not not wrong Xavier does all the characters that should never cut in my presence it's Charles Xavier I don't like seeing Charles cussing so much and look I understand that it fits the type of character that he is in this film as he is losing his mind he is senile so of course he's more prone to these petty outbursts but that doesn't mean it changes how I feel about it I still can't see Charles Xavier cursing but overall guys despite a few problems I still found Logan to be a super film that I thoroughly enjoyed watching from beginning to end it is my second favorite Wolverine film after the Wolverine and I thought it was an excellent send-off to an iconic character and an iconic role portrayed by Hugh Jackman and he will sorely be missed but I am very thankful that for his last film as Wolverine he made it one hell of a film that I highly recommend that you all go see in fact I'll even need to tell you guys to go see it because you already have seen it or bored to see it regardless of what I think but as always guys I'm not the end-all be-all appear when it comes to Logan I would love to know what you guys saw about the show as well did you absolutely adore it is it your favorite Wolverine film
