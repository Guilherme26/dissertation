she plays this very young my innocent girl who falls in love with this Laurence Olivier's character and they have a very quick marriage,0.11956807
and then before you know it she swept away to this crazy big castle that he lives in with a bunch of spooky people that work there,0.46875995
and as the film kind of progresses,0.07981233
you see that Laurence Olivier's character is haunted and tormented by the memory of his wife Rebecca under creepy and mysterious circumstances,0.31089434
I don't went on with this one,0.096689224
I don't really want to dig very far at all into it,0.13062215
I'll always say is you'll see an amazing transformation in Joanne Fontaine's character and she starts to become more wary my paranoia to what's going on with Laurence Olivier was there a murder involved,0.24564542
and so on you got to really follow the story,0.059821904
how it unfolds,0.0576016
I don't want to drop too many bombs or secrets or anything if you haven't seen it watch it without reading anything about it because it's a really cool mystery that if you don't know anything about the story who was who it's just really neat events of this film wonderful,0.126962
and again Joan,0.0341306
Fontaine was amazing,0.06612176
I'll prove my ignorance here I've never seen her at anything before but I absolutely loved her in this film and I actually got to see her in another film recently,0.24108203
I'll do that review soon for Alfred Hitchcock's suspicion another really good film but uh the film is great it's in this really lush black and white the castle they live in is like uber-creepy,0.16307113
and the I thought was really neat is the head maid woman who works there her name was Judith Anderson I'm watching her I'm like wow this is creepy old actress,0.41947642
I know her from somewhere,0.10392817
and then I had to do a little research,0.055453822
she was the Vulcan High Priestess from Star Trek 3 you know remember when mr.,0.047601108
Spock,0.034960046
he has to get his brain back from McCoy,0.6047827
and then they do the Vulcan ritual where you know - over over nerdy here anyhow she was the Vulcan High Priestess in that film and like I,0.25621137
mentioned in my previous,0.060867622
review I love it when I can kind of bridge a really old film with a semi old film from like the 1980s so it's kind of my little skip board of like I'm getting back to the 1940s to review films but I can kind of tie it in every,0.12115572
now and then like Hume Cronyn or this Judith Anderson woman from Hades you,0.2817744
know and that's the era I grew up in and watching films it's like wow that's really,0.07660489
cool so she was in that what was a little,0.08118768
bizarre,0.084268495
I just wanted to make a mention of this is Laurence Olivier know he does a great job,0.06025136
and what I love about this actor is he he sounds like Wesley from The Princess Bride Carrie Carrie use I'm sure if I'm saying /name right his character,0.08160977
he just kind of has that posh English voice,0.088764176
well if you listen to lawns Olivia in this film it reminded me a lot of Wesley from Princess Bride there's another little bridge to the 1980s and I thought that was great but what is weird is and I know they did this a lot in the older films he's clearly a lot older than Joan Fontaine,0.15260532
but he kind of adds to the creepiness of that by making comments like you can't be too careful with children referring to his wife or don't be such a little idiot,0.9427899
I guess I mean that's not something,0.05882995
I would say to my wife I guess another thing I wanted to mention too was the actor George Sanders who was in this film was he was kind of the untrustworthy character,0.20014417
he was the voice of the share come,0.07860311
shall Sher Khan from Jungle Book,0.046290796
I said read Shara Shere Khan and you can tell like his voice,0.101886064
he stopped that sinister voice it's really cool but it's like not a tiger obviously it's you know a human actor and he does a really great job in the film so that's Rebecca the film is about the mystery of who is Rebecca,0.15273076
what was her importance and why is everybody seems so haunted by her and is she actually haunting the mansion,0.14935553
I mean there's so many great questions you can you get to resolve watching I'm gonna leave it at that,0.09487114
and since this has been a generally goofy review to begin with I'm gonna end it with Kermit Kermit,0.46838033
what were your thoughts about Rebecca,0.06870139
I know you should really take the time to get to know someone first before you get married,0.09729275
why is that correct,0.04270249
