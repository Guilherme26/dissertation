[Music] either guys how are you so before we dive into the review I first want to say this Thank You Pixar I was so tired of those talking cars and Larry the Cable Guy as a tow truck please no more of that all right let's talk about Disney Pixar's inside out so what is this movie all about it features a young girl named Riley and we get an inside look into her mind at the characters of anger disgust sadness and fear who make up her emotions by the way on a quick side note if my anger emotion actually had to become a real person like a character I think it would be a mix of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho JK Simmons from whiplash and this guy right here Lois bloom from Nightcrawler steady hands now going into the movie inside out I didn't know much about this movie I knew it was about emotions as directed by the same guy who directed up and monsters inc and that's all I knew and that's all I needed to know plus she slapped Pixar on there I'm probably gonna go see that animated movie unless you have Pixar then you have a whole bunch of cars underneath that I'm not gonna go see that movie one of the biggest themes in this movie is growing up and letting go and that's sometimes tough to do I mean look at me look what I'm doing right now I'm 28 years old I'm sitting in a room I call the foot cave I have a whole bunch of movies over there I have oversized Star Wars toys I say it's pretty safe to say I haven't quite let go of my childhood yet but you know what I at least I don't play our dinger turtles in the bathtub anymore yes I do now I could dive deeper into the plot of this film but you know what I don't think it's necessary just know this there's more to this movie than the trailers are letting you know and that's always a good thing and my biggest fear before watching this movie was that it was going to be somewhat repetitive you have this young girl she's angry she's sad it's like okay I get it by the hour and a half mark of the movie but you know what I was very surprised at the way that they structured this movie I mean yeah you do get those things but it's a very layered movie there's almost two different universes and both of them are just as enjoyable as one another this movie also has a lot of comedy it's a Pixar movie you will laugh but the most important thing that this movie has is an impactful drama element that's kind of intertwined with nostalgia and what I'm talking about is this movie will give you those feels yeah I almost teared up in the theater well you know what I looked around before I did it and said I'm still a man everybody and if a tear did trickle down my cheek I would have said I get some sour patch dust in my eyeball I actually had to do that one time but let's talk more about that nostalgic vibe that this movie gives you this is one of those movies and I love movies like this that make you think about your entire life and if you're a little bit older you're an adult I'm 28 years old this movie really takes you back to your childhood memories it makes you remember things and when a movie about emotions can make you feel emotions well I'd say that movie did its job I really like the nostalgic vibes that this movie is throwing out I like movies that make you think about your own life and I'd say that's probably the most beneficial thing that this movie has going for it if you're a little bit older and you go see the movie it will make you feel emotions and if you're a younger kid and you go see the movie you're gonna be entertained it's funny it's energetic the visuals look great so yeah there's something for everybody in this movie now let's talk about some of the other main characters in the film Riley's emotions you have anger you have a sadness you have disgust you have fear and you have joy and these are essentially the characters or emotions that make Riley do everything that she does in the movie and throughout this movie you get a lot of comical bits between these characters is doing random things at first I really hated the character of sadness okay just one of the elbow would draw up on top of her but you know what after thinking about it I was like she's sadness you're not supposed to like sadness it's depressing you hate it so in that regard sadness as a character did her job so here are my final flicking thoughts on the movie inside out overall this movie has way more going for it than I expected it to it's deeper than I thought it would be and actually had emotions and feelings and things actually went into my heart pulled on it and said John we want you to cry and I said not today and you know what I'll be honest with you if I watch this movie all alone I probably would cry just a little bit I would get a little bit of watery eye it does remind you of certain things that happen in your childhood and it also has a lot of other little tidbits that I think a lot of people all deal with but no one talks about for example you know when you watch like a bubble gum commercial and that theme song gets stuck in your head all day long or you remember ten years later this movie deals with things like that I'm going to give the movie inside out that's my joy face now there's my angry face uppercut and a this is a solid movie that does its job a movie about emotions that makes you feel emotions okay guys that's my review for the movie inside out and by the way before I go if you haven't already make sure you check out my last video where I did an entire foot cave tour video that's right I show you every detail every nook
