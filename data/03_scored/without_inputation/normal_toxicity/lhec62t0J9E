I'm not gonna lie,0.15176593
it was really hard to get myself to watch Romo i sat down right after it came out on Netflix to try and watch it for lunch and I finished my lunch before the credits ended the credits are very slow without much reward,0.09152419
so I was like this is taking too long,0.09042019
it's a it's a little bit too slow of a burn I'd say for the first half of the movie the final thing that really got me to check it out,0.23427866
though was it's you know it's it's a warrants situation that it's just winning award after award after award it has momentum,0.0629962
and I imagine more and more people would be like okay,0.11681903
I gotta watch it right or maybe you'll be just on the edge like I was and Here I am to give you that last push to tell you that you should indeed watch it but it's gonna be tough,0.088726364
you know you got to know that going in because even once I started Romo it was hard to finish it I took in fact several breaks but did the movies credit,0.08797521
I did watch it in a single day,0.08548043
because the story did hook me and you know what it wasn't even so much,0.14588177
the story as I wanted to see what korone was doing he's he's all over this,0.06712548
and in more ways than just the usual you know being the director in the filmmakers situations you're about to find out but you know he seemed in control even if I felt I didn't love what he was doing so out of respect for him as an artist,0.08789296
I was like,0.039237767
well let me see what you've got and I also wanted to see more of his outstanding black-and-white cinematography cinematography made all the more impressive because quarren has never shot a movie before he's a double in the cinematography before,0.28673086
but Wow clearly you know just being around such wonderful cinematographers throughout his career has really rubbed off on the guy so good it's so good cinematography is amazing,0.14029299
and on that note Rolla is an intensely personal film for korone so much so that I would wager that watching Roma is only half of the experience that he's put together here,0.10166737
you need to know her owns personal story behind the film the extraordinary almost unbelievable efforts that he went through to recreate his childhood how and why he chose his cast especially his lead actress and on top of all that the history of Mexico at the time not just politically but also economically as well as race relations and I can imagine Alfonso Cuaron talking to awards voters and explaining all of that what an awards campaign I imagine it is captivating because I had a great time reading about it during the movie and afterwards because I was like because I was like how is this autobiographical I'd heard I'd heard a little bit about that you know the movie just wasn't answering these questions for me,0.06269317
so I had to go and find out although korone has all my movies do during awards season is going to Awards voters and has I am sure an amazing presentation,0.04318086
and that's why it's doing so well during awards season a lot of awards of voters know stuff that you do not,0.08675586
and most people who watch this movie will not know but I'm going to fix that for you I have links down below to two articles that I feel do the trick and you can either read them before or after you watch the movie it's up to you,0.08026096
what kind of experience,0.055696364
you want to have I highly recommend you read them before you watch the movie I think you'll have a much better time and be able to get through it in one sitting perhaps even enthusiastically so but either way again this is more of a package situation than just a movie,0.07843326
now I personally feel that a film should stand on its own,0.08311848
and I do think the core own could have done a better job hinting at the bigger picture in the film in itself,0.06521981
I don't think it needs to have all this additional reading material,0.08777631
I think that you know lots of historical films have been able to allude to the bigger picture within the context of the film,0.05195256
I think his strokes and Roma are too broad perhaps because he's too close to the material it actually happened to him and his loved ones,0.1415466
so he automatically knows what he's looking at and also he can fill in the blanks whereas we who have no attachment to this material cannot do that this is why filmmaking is supposed to be a team effort,0.08128633
so somebody can catch these things and be like quarrel and you're too close to the material no one else is going to get this,0.10273076
and it's why producers never do directors any,0.10856872
favors is interesting to have this conversation after talking about M night Shyamalan on movie math yesterday uh you know producers don't do their directors,0.15903717
any favors by giving them total creative freedom that said though role is still hasn't awful lot going for it,0.09537113
and you know what I wasn't being like,0.12271497
what else is going on your Corona and furiously researching the movie you know during breaks,0.18039542
I did appreciate it from the perspective of what I do know going into the film and that's the history of cinema and the feminist movement,0.15291949
now on that first point the history of cinema it is brilliant and impressive both from a creative perspective and a business standpoint,0.029006986
I mean it's so savvy when it comes to awards season,0.081346706
I can't believe it but korone has mimicked very very well French New Wave cinema and famous Italian black-and-white films like Federico Fellini's eighth-and-a-half again it's all down to the black and white cinematography absolutely stunning in fact I'm still thinking about it that's what stuck with me,0.16586316
the most about the movie 1960s Mexico depicted,0.06982838
so sharply so cleanly and so vibrant Lee that it just seems so alive,0.0974986
I would also say on a side note that I thought that cuar√≥n had an interesting directing style and it was a little absurdist as well which I think not only you know points to these two these uh you know movements in film French New Wave cinema and Italian black-and-white cinema but there is a tad voice Anderson in there too some like just really you know ironic moments that really just got you you know I don't want to give any of them away,0.14072338
but that either also kind of kept me hooked and there were more of those as the film went along but also movies even factored in to Roma's story itself as the characters go to the movies frequently although a lot of times not to actually watch the movie and in doing so they showcase,0.051560465
some of the truly beautiful movie houses that were the norm in the mid twentieth century,0.03504751
there's one in particular with the way the light from the projector lights up this movie theater and there,0.059399232
and you know there are characters that were with her in the back,0.052083854
so you can see the whole thing,0.060769882
it's just gorgeous,0.10740807
I loved it so much,0.08093199
and there's even a clip in the film from the 1960 movie maroon which the characters go to see which instantly brought him up bring Stu mind when I was watching it Coronas gravity and sure enough again I took a break,0.07489097
I was like why is this in here,0.06880396
let me go look this is one of the problems just watching movie on Netflix cuz,0.10364044
you can do this,0.102107264
you know you can't do it in a theater,0.13760759
although again as I said it did add to my enjoyment of the film this is almost reviewed like a pop up movie where you can go click on stuff while you're watching it,0.080006965
because sure enough it turns out the marooned was one of her own childhood favorite films that actually inspired him to make the 2013 oscar-winning movie and interestingly marooned won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects back in 1969 as did gravity so many years later but chrome didn't just include marooned as an homage but also in the movie in roma we see two separate children at separate times one middle-class on one very poor and that's reflected in their environments and their astronaut costumes you know adrift and I think that that's a metaphor for how it drifted along we all feel so often in life and how it means so much when someone finally another human who is able to make connection with us in the vast blackness darkness,0.14914928
I think that you know the cold darkness of space or also you could argue life,0.18599868
so I liked that element the film also touches on how fate decides so much for us,0.06654736
just by birth such as race and economic status and how especially in the late 1960s all over the world,0.092408195
but here in Mexico that those elements define one's life and inescapable ways as for the feminism bit the ending of this film reminded me an awful lot of the ending of big little lies even down to the beach and it's interesting to see Hollywood transition from these stories of female survival to ones of female empowerment equally important and I'd also like to point out that this fiercely feminist film is written and directed by a man proving that gender lines or any lines really should not be drawn too harshly in Hollywood as it continues,0.2544643
as over to diversify Hollywood continues to diversify in front of him behind the camera and the stories that it's telling what I mean by that as I think it would be dangerous to start saying who can tell what stories,0.1006998
I think what's important is just to get the stories out there as long as there's diversity in other films and in other ways,0.08749397
I don't think that we want to you know divide ourselves up all right,0.07779212
because you have been denied this film now also I wonder how people react will react to the fact that it does not seem to start out as a feminist film whatsoever,0.2397809
but sure turns into one all right,0.101257876
finally do I think that we Roman deserves all the awards that it's getting,0.122820206
I think it deserves to be nominated for sure,0.09924069
and the more I think about the more I think about Roma and the more I explore it both actually research researching it and just you know again mulling it over the more it does impress me,0.08670111
but again I personally feel that a film should stand on its own,0.076529324
and korone is way too close to the material roma is an impressive intriguing film but it's not perfect film,0.06790655
and in fact it has many many flaws,0.10729681
obviously,0.06617626
so still if you read the articles I've put down below in the video description I do believe that it is worth your time especially since for most of you you can watch it for free as part of your Netflix subscription,0.14961796
I see just a lazy afternoon,0.24033108
that's when I started it as the perfect time,0.05610075
and you should just force yourself to keep watching trust me it's gonna pick up it's gonna and again,0.5154597
if you read these articles I think you'll enjoy it more and by the end I think that you will agree that it was time well spent especially if you're cinephile or if you're interested in any of the elements that I mentioned here so that's my review of Roma,0.2792022
I'm curious to hear your own thoughts down below have you seen it,0.24132729
if not why not what's it gonna take to get you to watch it and also it please no spoilers and the second half of the movie in particular there are some very good surprises,0.056552958
and that does a lot to help to help,0.036432296
the second act,0.08096029
so don't ruin that for anyone they're gonna need it,0.112858765
if they're gonna get through the movie alright,0.080735765
so again,0.050375227
