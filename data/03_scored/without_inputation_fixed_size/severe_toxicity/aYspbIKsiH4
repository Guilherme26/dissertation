South Korean film but what it's about okay it's like this like I know the,0.051364817
director bong joon-ho I saw him say the best way to go into this movie,0.05985389
is cold so I'm gonna give you a non spoiler warning basically I'm gonna do,0.068978876
that first act setup that I do in any review where it's kind of like,0.012466872
oh here's kind of what the movies about all right cut off before we start,0.099845394
getting into spoilers and here's what I think about the movie so out of respect,0.061662525
for him and his work and the fact that he would want you to go,0.028553674
into the movie cold not knowing anything I'm gonna let you know alright I'm gonna,0.04548127
kind of let you know where the movie heads if you don't want to even,0.1711471
know that long story short you should see parasites great but the movies about this,0.2852278
family living in poverty and the son gets the opportunity to be an English tutor,0.04943778
for this rich family's daughter and then he's like hey I know someone who could,0.07846773
be an art instructor for your son and then he kind of weasels his sister,0.28211677
into it the whole family just kind of weasels their way into this rich family's,0.23185979
house and of course the rich family doesn't know they're all related so it's this,0.055107806
whole they're hustlers it's a scheme going on and that kept the movie really engaging,0.11274929
even intense when there wasn't necessarily an intense moment but it's always on your mind,0.021303836
like are you guys but the movie is definitely about classism and the rich versus,0.043422524
the poor and the way this movie breaks it down and portrays it's pretty genius,0.07500744
I mean that's not even all there is in the movie I mean it's about,0.04254315
social class social status this side versus that side yes but it's not even limited,0.0317113
to just that to the point not to sound redundant but it's a movie about,0.018841991
human beings how we treat each other versus how we view each other how we,0.25506026
don't even think it's well here but it does it in a way that's fun,0.043238267
so it's weirdness out loud but the movie is actually quite fun in its execution,0.24023181
it's funny it's whimsical it's fun but also turns up the drama it's relevant it's,0.034983337
actually dark thought-provoking this movie has a scene that goes from fun to very intense,0.05742065
to pretty dark and tragic not every filmmaker can pull that off without having conflicting,0.08538364
tone there's a scene with a storm that wonderfully illustrates like how the two families,0.040397935
deal with it and what it means to them and it just it puts it,0.034252968
all into perspective for it's a kid this is actually a true story I was,0.020928673
young I was no older than 11 or 12 and remember this girl she was,0.11584971
younger she was in the single digits probably eight or nine so she's younger than,0.025785845
me this is in church and we were all all these kids were pumps cuz,0.09750395
we were like yeah there might not be any school tomorrow there's gonna be snow,0.037944734
yeah no school and snow we're gonna play in the snow is gonna be fun,0.018439556
but I remember her saying it's easy to say that but what about all the,0.013520523
poor and homeless people and they're gonna freeze and that's it's easy to see it,0.12052728
your way but what about how they experience it true story and this is the,0.0098068025
90s you know what's in social media around it it was like this kid just,0.02473685
goes to church anyhow there's a part in this movie that kind of illustrates the,0.07647683
same thing with weather and it just took me right back to that that time,0.04043984
when I was a kid that a younger kid taught me that lesson that parasite,0.25354874
sillas wild world and it's one of the impressive things about this movie more than,0.060801778
a few times I've seen a movie have a message but it's like the movie,0.01825796
relies on its message to carry the entire thing so it's like off the message,0.07263739
doesn't hit you it's what do you have now what do you have for a,0.038065135
movie what do you have for a film what do you have for entertainment but,0.03213768
this movie if you want to see the message and you definitely it's there I,0.044731606
mean at a point you you can't not see it anymore but the movie itself,0.04278794
message aside is remarkably entertaining it's like a dark drama comedy it's a dark dramedy,0.13062212
more movies fail at that then succeed at that and parasites one of the ones,0.36696848
that does succeed in that and astronomy we call that the Goldilocks zone God give,0.069783755
props to Kang ho song I believe that's how you pronounce his name might be,0.07410013
a couple of mispronunciations in here but that dude everyone in the movie does a,0.03632435
great job I thought they were all fantastic but when I think of the cast,0.05288742
like he's the one who stands out he was amazing I'm actually really shocked he,0.02475481
wasn't nominated for an Oscar but dude just crushes it I thought it was great,0.04409968
it's definitely one of those movies you need to do a second pass like after,0.034378022
you watch it you should probably watch it again because when you start realizing how,0.039418116
the movies addressing what it's addressing and how it's breaking it down cool to go,0.057362113
back and watch the movie again and see how it does it from the beginning,0.022580324
up until the point you actually kind of it gripped you with an implication does,0.07303982
that mean I watch this movie twice but yep there's no real rush to get,0.03879817
my review out so yeah I watched it twice I was glad I watched it,0.06548334
twice I appreciated it more the second time cuz in the end I thought parasite,0.23080322
was great I'm not one of those people's like Oscars are the end-all be-all but,0.15446429
if you're working in that industry they kind of are for you and your career,0.016598327
so I know everybody's touched on it but seeing the look on bong Joon Ho's,0.0514626
face when he won the Oscar for I believe it was Best Screenplay there's smile,0.021017808
on his face puts a smile on my face the spectrum of people after they,0.2588918
watched parasite it's like it's the movie of the decade or it was great whether,0.20364797
or not it's the film of the decade film of the year or just a,0.013174627
great movie that's a different conversation most agree it's a solid move it's great it's,0.025817107
well-made it's engaging it's well acted there's definitely worth watching definitely worth buying on blu-ray,0.034374695
right so parasite have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you,0.27800003
thought comment below let me know and as always if you liked what you've seen,0.035853397
