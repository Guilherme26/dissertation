hello everyone welcome back to my channel,0.0952346
so what today's video is going to be a little kind of do I want to call it a review,0.14899333
I don't know if I would consider it,0.15098488
I guess,0.05009925
it's a review right,0.068052106
I don't know is it a review,0.11606194
you don't even know were talking about it,0.15513414
okay,0.05096789
well let's hold a review because I guess it's kind of a review um,0.06565923
what I'm trying to say is I'm going to be talking today to you guys about the movie 8th grade,0.15448758
no I have here,0.07644394
my boner my bo burnham shirt Boop can you see it from my who do you okay,0.88189316
are you okay okay coffee,0.027820624
okay,0.050967902
okay,0.050967902
so this is from when I went to go see a bow during his meet copy show which was incredible,0.06224715
I am a huge fan of Bo Burnham,0.079818085
I have been for several years,0.03475132
now I absolutely love o Burnham,0.107219316
if you know me you know that because he is love him,0.09615612
I watch him constant,0.13052417
and i rewatch his same specials over an over Doria like his songs like his you know comedy songs are saved in my playlist of music that I listened to because because I love him I am a huge fan of comedy in general and I grew up like with comedy,0.08139096
I mean I absolutely love it,0.08295148
I love it if I have to say I love Seattle comedian I could sit here and name every single Xena comedian that has touched my life in one way or another,0.16586532
but bo burnham is just absolutely credible and that's everything I'm gonna say about that,0.1058906
so yes maybe I'm a little biased but I don't think,0.083975054
so what I'm trying to say is since oh what I'm trying to say is that laburnum so much when I found out that he had a movie coming out which is the movie eighth grade I knew that,0.0883655
I liked how to see it as soon as it opened because I was very excited and I'm he hasn't come out with like believe many projects within the last couple years so make happy premiered on Netflix on June 3rd of 2016,0.11716946
and I saw it in 2015 twice,0.07272052
and then of course when it came on Netflix I watched it like every day,0.06926759
but after that it wasn't really much more that you heard from him,0.07751813
so when this movie came out,0.108599745
I was very like,0.049896706
I wasn't wasting any time I was first in line to go see it,0.09573089
and I knew as soon as I saw it that I would have to make a video about it,0.072825655
and I knew that I hadn't talked about it because it was comedic in senses of course it had a funny touch to it,0.07366034
but it was it's a movie that everyone should see let's just say that it was a movie but absolutely everyone needs to see and parents need to have their children see this movie I mean it is it needs to be watched,0.081810735
it needs to be talked about it needs to be out there for everyone to see it because it talks about real-life stuff,0.108417235
I mean it really does like it's called eighth grade for a reason it talks about 8th grade it focuses on a young girl who's in raid and she was going through real-life eighth-grade struggles,0.18966104
I don't know about you guys,0.19329154
but 8th grade wasn't my prime time,0.16524608
eighth grade was not necessarily my ear um,0.1057663
I went to a Catholic school my whole life and my school actually closed down in the 6th grade so for a 7th and 8th grade I had to go to a different Catholic school,0.18926896
I had to remake friends I had to graduate with people that I didn't know for very long,0.08234896
I was the only person going to my high school,0.1009899
so I had to make these friends and then say goodbye to them all right away,0.09330928
eighth grader like wasn't the best and also aside from that like eighth grade was not the best in my personal life,0.22549555
I mean it was the year I lost my father to a heart attack so like that was really tough on that end of the spectrum but just in a very you know in a relatable way eighth grade was just not great,0.1211147
I mean it wasn't great for anybody,0.24127693
I don't even know like trying to think about it,0.15099315
I don't think eighth grade was really that also more like that memorable or fun for really anybody um,0.10697539
but when you're in eighth grade it seems like your whole world,0.24454549
I mean when you're living that day today as a 13 14 year old kid,0.2513787
I mean that's all you know that that that's what you wake up and you know you're going to school and you're going to see the Mean Girls and you're gonna see the hot kid that you like and you're going to have maybe not one friend that like kind of understands you but you also don't really know if you guys are actually great friends because you know maybe there was a rumor going around or maybe something happened or whatever,0.32317826
I mean an eighth grade such trivial stuff happens,0.122634254
I mean we all know that,0.06605482
but this movie just focused on those real life experiences,0.12017726
and it really talked about what actually goes on and it just it really showed what it is actually like but aside from that I need it,0.08178737
don't get me wrong,0.11416276
it made me really a very awful awkward terrible moment that I had as a 14 year old in,0.34171098
eighth grade getting ready to go to high school,0.13325214
it was terrible but it also just kind of gives you hope as an adult even just knowing that tough times don't last you know as much as it focuses on all these bad things,0.18949369
there's that silver lining of the fact that good things like good things are possible,0.03807565
and good things will happen and 8th grade isn't the end-all be-all,0.12366877
and I think that goes for every every stagnant point that we have in our life when we feel like we come to you know a halt and if we have a hiatus of positivity if it seems like nothing good is happening and we're at a standstill we have to know we have to know him to understand that those moments,0.0870709
aren't our ending I mean they're not the finalization of our lives,0.1315864
it's just a tough time and we get through it,0.09670179
and we learn from Anna we grow from it,0.10832341
and we go on to the next moment,0.05005305
and that's how it works,0.051505588
but when you're young eighth grade seems like such a big year because it's the last year before you go into high school,0.1488964
and I mean people are finally you're starting to come into their bodies and and and we're learning all these new things and we're having all these new experiences,0.18372974
and it's it's a crazy time and it's an exciting time in a scary time and an awful time and it's just took everything all at once are wrapped up in tied to the bow and that's what 8th grade hands to us,0.277087
but like I said looking back on it as a 21 year old,0.1649951
now I realize that III wasn't everything but when you're in eighth grade it is everything to you,0.18411015
I mean it's all that you're living,0.2409122
it's what your day-to-day is and it's not always great,0.13074897
and I don't think it's a bad thing to say that because it's not and that movie touches on every single one of those emotions I laughed I cried I cringed a lot a lot,0.115039244
but in good ways,0.09286576
I cringed because it was just so relatable and so truthful and so authentic it wasn't a try-hard movie it wasn't trying to relate to younger kids,0.07714664
it was just so genuine,0.041265637
I mean it was what every single person that has gone to eighth grade has felt like and lived through and and been in and it was just it was authentic and that that is what drew me in and as much as I love Bo Burnham,0.08949323
you know this was in a movie about Boober about bo burnham,0.2731675
this wasn't this wasn't watching him on stage and a t-shirt and jeans for an hour telling those jokes I mean so it wasn't the fact that Bob Arnold made this movie that made me love it,0.11363278
it was how authentic it was that really drew me in and allowed me to appreciate it so much more than I would have if it was a movie that was just trying too hard sorry clip had to come out,0.09726454
but it was really you know mater's uh-huh but when I found out that the movie was rated R um,0.076413035
I was I was just kind of really shocked and frustrated because this is a movie like I said that touches that touches on all those bad things,0.14893298
and it doesn't hide,0.059094112
the fact that those bad things happen,0.15107238
and that III isn't a glory here,0.1327654
but it gives hope on how to get through that and how to understand that better things to come,0.09747785
and but there is always going to be positivity that leads after something negative has happen and that is important for kids that are actually in eighth grade to see and to know and to understand we shouldn't be taught those things years after it happens it should be rated R for people who have already made it past that tough point who already understand that,0.052068558
and yeah it's a friendly reminder like I mentioned earlier to adults to always be aware and always to understand that good things do come and that negativity doesn't last forever but it's very important and kind of almost made for,0.05136174
eighth graders to understand that you are going through,0.1110627
these tough times,0.072050296
you are living these sometimes terrible situations that seem like your whole life that seem like this is everything that's ever going to happen for you um and and and it's important for them to kind of see this because when you're when you're at that age or when you're in those experiences and living those moments sometimes you feel like you're the only person going through that bad moment,0.15368062
you feel like you're the only person that suffering negative,0.35526794
we are going through a rough times,0.07777665
and you don't understand all the time that other people,0.19176537
and most other people are actually going through those same times as well and you know we're at a point where everyone's trying to impress other people are trying to live up to society's standards and that's a whole other topic,0.04861515
oh of course it all ties back together,0.07300189
but you know it when we're going through that we don't want to admit to these bad things,0.13572042
we don't want to allow other people to see us weak or to make other people think that we don't have our lives together,0.18372622
and I mean at 14 years old like doesn't even really have their life together at 21 years old do I have my life together we don't need it,0.12230114
we don't need that,0.08356852
but like I'm saying it's hard,0.09305923
and it's difficult sometimes at that agent at any age really but especially when you're at that age because that's when everyone's really trying to fit in,0.080829665
I mean middle school is really the beginning of that in many cases and it started younger and younger every day but it Grange is kind of the culmination of all of that but you know it's tough to admit that and since nobody is really getting the courage to admit that it's it's you know people are kids are ignorant to the fact that other kids are going harlot,0.55138415
so you seem alone in that feeling but this movie really touches based on the fact that so many other kids are going through it majority of these kids are going through it,0.10540189
and that's why it's incredibly frustrating to a viewer like myself who appreciates them to be so so much to know that it was raining hard because the kids that really need to see it that really need to have this understanding and this mindset from a young age that they can get past it more easily and that they can be aware that at all times and not have to learn,0.07134159
in seven years later they need to see this movie to know those things and to learn those lessons because not everyone is is teaching them that not everyone is talking to them about that and a movie like this shows it from an eighth graders perspective it shows it from a fourteen year olds point of view so that's what they need to see,0.048600923
and the fact that it was written or it's just it's just it's just it's frustrating,0.10417766
and I don't even have words for because it's just incredibly it's just it's just so frustrating,0.17508414
that's like the only where they could come to my mind right,0.09434097
now even describe it because it just bothers me a lot so parents I encourage you to show this movie to your children teachers I encourage you to recommend this movie if you can't show it in the classroom I recommend that you guys you know tell your students about this movie allow them to be aware of it because it is a great film it's it has a great message,0.085389085
it's wonderful for young people to see and I think it's very important and beneficial and crucial for these young kids to see because it touches base on,0.101364605
so many things that they need to be aware of,0.047999877
and if nobody's telling them about it then they're not going to have the ability to see,0.09671845
and I think it's really important that they do,0.051368147
so yes all in all I guess I'm just trying to say is I think April was wonderfully executed,0.19386744
I think it touched base on real life either in experiences,0.13483462
in such a beautiful way cringe-worthy way yes comedic way at times heart-wrenching yes of course,0.15333043
I mean all these things but it was so real it was so relatable it was so authentic and so genuine and I absolutely loved every single second of it even the second thought I was cringing because I know that that's how eighth grade really was,0.07775928
and this movie just it just did it it just completely completely did it and I could not be more thankful for everyone who was involved we of course will burn them for for making the movie and and and just you know of course executing the movie but to everyone who had a part in it it just,0.24764751
thank you,0.039406788
thank you for your time,0.057409495
thank you for your energy,0.051184032
thank you for being a part of spreading the message,0.07705605
and like I said parents teachers adults who are in the lives of children you know in eighth grade or younger or in high school whatever it might be whoever whoever you have in your life that might be going through this type of moment,0.225437
I encourage you to really share this with them because it could really really be life-changing,0.15499043
and I just recommend this movie to everyone oh thank you,0.09688904
thank you,0.039406788
thank you,0.039406788
thank you,0.039406788
so much for everything,0.064864755
you've ever done,0.11971574
I mean I could make a whole other video on just the positivity that you've brought into my life before this movie ever,0.28760824
even came out,0.062169623
I mean I'm talking three years ago four years ago you helped me through a really rough time in my life incredibly rough time in my life you were there for me without even knowing that you are of course but your your comedy and your words and just the way that you talk about life and just everything everything that you have done and your professional career and just it's just really helped me,0.15922329
it's gotten me through some of the toughest times of my life,0.09798222
I truly credit you with saving my life and I know that's a statement and that's a it's very very intense words,0.07674152
but it's truth,0.03059147
and I you know I love you for it,0.052241094
and I could not be more thankful for them like,0.08435818
I said this is could be me being biased but it's not maybe who highest it's really the truth,0.074060686
