today based on a recommendation of a former student alfred Bowden I watched portrait of,0.043962717
a lady on fire from 2019 Cecile how do you say her name Celine Scorsese,0.24475515
that's the level of filmmaking we have going on here Celine Shyama I'm sure I,0.120308146
brutalized the pronunciation of that anyway this movie is on an isolated island in a,0.1002325
Brittany at the end of that's like off the coast of France or and like,0.0844138
yeah at the end of the 18th century so when it's the 18th century what,0.061379988
are we in now we're in the 21st century so the 18th cent so I,0.036870822
was like the late 1700s I always get confused by that because I'm dumb anyway,0.61570084
a female painter is obliged to paint a wedding portrait of a young woman that,0.13528152
young woman's sister has recently died and the mother is also once the painter essentially,0.14230621
to keep an eye on her we need to name these characters because it's all,0.090053506
women and I'll just end up saying she she sent up saying she she she,0.40807185
so are the painter that comes is oh my god no me mmm Mariano yeah,0.12546694
yeah yeah and and that's that's Maryanne and then Adele hey Nell yeah yeah yeah,0.11708219
these are all French people is Eloise Eloise who is the woman to be a,0.23309304
painted yeah those are the two characters that we really need to know about except,0.055636365
there's another there's a hot woman who works in the house named Sophie and that's,0.35580865
played by Liana dorami nlgger me dude I don't know how to read any of,0.361873
these names it's my fault I know anyway I'll learn them eventually okay so this,0.31089434
is a lesbian movie that's when I said that I was gonna watch it my,0.6364068
roommates girlfriend was like oh that's a real lesbian movie and I was like yeah,0.73955685
okay yeah no she wasn't saying like in a negative way but I was like,0.18547401
yeah I kind of get that feeling anyway it's about a cat so many things,0.085766934
look at all these notes I took took like serial killer level notes here so,0.32733798
what makes it fascinating is that the young woman kalenna or no Heloise sorry Eloise,0.1554492
whatever she she doesn't to sit for the painting because basically the completion of the,0.11603387
painting means it's that that she must be Wed to this guy in Milan she,0.23972854
doesn't want to do it she's never even met him she never been to Milan,0.13686007
she's never done anything really she's just been in the in like a nunnery or,0.30601737
coven coven covenant she was in a coven of witches yeah so she she only,0.4436827
knows like like she knows nothing basically she and she's very resilient against this idea,0.15509437
of marriage and being married off and not having her freedom and you know at,0.13425705
least there are books and like church music at the coven so you know she,0.08274127
and then and then our painter Marianne she's like free you know she doesn't she,0.10882899
her father was a painter and she'll take over his business and she's could paint,0.26539654
her portrait artist you know and so she does have freedoms and slowly marianne falls,0.13165721
in love with Eloise and maybe she returns to love I won't spoil it everything,0.15520877
I say will be like I won't say anything after like the first hour of,0.05609735
it you know so there won't be too many spoilers so since since Eloise refuses,0.099043
to sit for the painting Marianne has basically been brought in under false pretenses to,0.11216121
be like oh she's gonna just watch after you and take you on walks and,0.15418203
stuff she's gonna be like you're a chaperone and your guardian and just like a,0.43245208
friend until the wedding when in actuality it's obviously like you know so you know,0.15308683
that like I don't know what I thought was so good I can't even read,0.16478026
my handwriting I just feel like I should just straight-up read it like instead of,0.12230819
trying to read it quickly so it's basically perfect writing because they don't need to,0.0684033
say anything and within like a two minutes of the movie I knew kind of,0.12775014
almost everything that was gonna happen but in a and I know I've said that,0.05161286
before as a negative but this and like it's like in the best way like,0.1428635
because a lot of movies they tell you what they're gonna the movies gonna be,0.07513421
about and then while it's being about that they're telling you look if look what,0.054340906
I'm being about and then at the end it goes look what I was just,0.057741567
about look what you just saw and tells you all about what you just saw,0.17840305
like everything is handed to you whereas these the best type of movies you go,0.07027685
oh oh yeah all right here we go there's here we go this is obviously,0.119324274
going to be a love story and it's obviously a tragic love story because not,0.061661728
nobody's happy and just the nlgger music and the way people are acting and the,0.43794113
the color of the sky you can just tell the filmmakers all I can go,0.08830704
and then we know the time period and know that you know society's inversion to,0.11631442
various forms of sexuality other than biblical makes people upset so you just kind of,0.419788
know that and then and then any relationship that's starts on a lie or a,0.12567937
deception is gonna eventually come to the head so we know all that stuff and,0.35828155
it's like oh my god I can kind of like even predict the feeling I'm,0.092207134
gonna have when this movie ends but different than like a nlgger Transformers movie where,0.31089434
you're like okay this and this and the cubes gotta go here and then obviously,0.15538153
that's gonna happen and this person said I don't like eating hot dogs and at,0.36466917
the end they're gonna have to like eat a hot dog so the bomb doesn't,0.19215998
go off because it'll be a hot dog between him and the bottom line right,0.45012087
push it with his nose you know so it's not that it basically starts and,0.29085526
goes this is what the movie is gonna be about just by like setting up,0.077814825
the vibe and then it doesn't say look it's about that it just is it,0.058751963
just unfolds which is which is what the big difference is and since our protagonists,0.058229297
like needs to remember her subjects face for later the audience becomes fixated on all,0.0988904
the little details it's like a genius writing device you know and make sense within,0.07936274
the story and within the way it's shot and it's movie where you kind of,0.17864977
like I just said he kind of know where everything is gonna go before it,0.08587011
happens but magically it like works anyway and you know that it's a tragic love,0.088086724
story forbidden that there's like suicide in the backdrop and like there's always a storm,0.31351167
kind of coming that kind of feeling and some films suffer from this in a,0.15297884
bad way and they forecast everything that's gonna happen and I just think that this,0.12509698
is the much better way I mean it just kind of was redundant and how,0.090772934
I said that but yeah once it like you just let it unfold and you,0.12090074
just burgeoning friendship it's like gets you interested in its it is two hours and,0.08527837
it is slowly paced but it should be there's a you know it should I,0.1143965
didn't feel like that I mean maybe Kylie out in a few minutes but probably,0.05541677
not I don't know it seemed all there to me seemed like it was the,0.06999805
right length I don't know like basically so I wrote this note down and then,0.08109141
like a second later they stay like confirmed what I said like they set it,0.094313316
up so that they don't have to say anything and you just get it it's,0.12977685
like music like it's just like if someone might not be able to describe but,0.110597946
within the first like five seconds of an Elliot Smith song even a little kid,0.13108937
can go oh it's like a sad song right like it you can just tell,0.1503593
it's not and within you know three notes of a Chuck Berry song you know,0.123212695
oh it's gonna be like a rock and roll like jumping around kind of song,0.15267602
you know and and sometimes it's hard to describe that especially the intricacies of music,0.09842558
and so the second I said that they the character asks oh you know it,0.04365577
says something about music and I was like oh my god my ears pricked up,0.43017638
I was like that she's like well you know you get to I'm gonna go,0.11806427
to church listen to music and although you never heard an orchestra before have you,0.15962705
and she's like no and and then she goes what's what's orchestra music sound like,0.15361093
and she goes it's not easy to relate music and it's like wow and then,0.06656624
later that's a thing like where it's like impossible to relate like your love for,0.06982514
somebody in words and then in the film then goes on to showing like through,0.07374831
actions how it's pretty amazing it's pretty amazing it's not really three acts it's like,0.09378347
a midpoint that's what I feel like or maybe it's five acts you know it's,0.058584236
either like I don't know because at the midpoint it like reak the movie kind,0.17353855
of restarts not not literally but we get like kind of a fresh I don't,0.0707553
know I don't want to spoil anything but that makes it sound like there's some,0.08429946
Shama Lani and twist like at out one our 100 the alien comes down and,0.15142927
transport them all to Planet lady on fire now it's it's great it's amazing and,0.4033455
it says it's like this feminist beacon type movie without pounding it you know like,0.5537724
into the ground or even have it like saying it you know but at one,0.09852252
point you realize oh look this this image right here is showing like a functioning,0.15447535
family of all women you know like two women and then like a younger woman,0.55470175
like that's kind of representative of a child like they're doing everything fine like there's,0.13886768
complete harmony here there's baby there's basically no men in the whole movie and the,0.21071336
ones that are in there are like I'm here to eat okay boy you know,0.18813168
great so it's all it's almost like how women are treated in almost every other,0.31089434
movie it's just like we need you to be there you know I don't know,0.12258023
so it's great I would see it I was expecting it to be more graphic,0.09296162
you know because my most recent French lesbians extravaganza movie was probably you said French,0.36378634
I think blue is the warmest color and that is like 30 minutes of that,0.07862524
is like hardcore pornography I think I think that movie is actually beautiful and not,0.69542736
that way guys but it is when I movie ended I was like kind of,0.08437169
kind of like know what it must be like to be a teenage lesbians like,0.6364068
going through like making the decision or coming coming to light anyway yeah everybody in,0.09528264
this movie the cast is amazing the writing is amazing directions amazing it's just top-notch,0.10994462
in every way and I really like that that like the biggest like element of,0.06174946
it that I like is that how you end up having to study the characters,0.10330171
in the way a painter would have to and how all the characters are like,0.039293308
fully represented and they're not just there to serve the story like they have a,0.052765094
life outside of the movie and within the I don't know whatever just nlgger watch,0.28595626
it's on Hulu you bastards it's not as long it's not like brutal yet like,0.8856221
I we've talked about this a lot but like once the pacing I understand this,0.07762853
once a movie gets over a certain like or if it's just not paced -,0.085779324
it's something you're used to then you start going this is boring and that's that,0.13791975
makes sense that's by design because you're used to all right I don't want to,0.106096715
nlgger talk about this anymore all right let's see what happens if I push this,0.5154597
button we get in sound I'm I'm like I'm afraid of doing something in anyway,0.10152623
[Applause] okay I probably should put a camera somewhere where you can see what I'm,0.14875187
doing I don't even know what I'm doing yet that's new set up is it's,0.11149027
