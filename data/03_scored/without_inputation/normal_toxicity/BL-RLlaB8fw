hey oh hey what's up Bradley just want to take another look at you all,0.18354963
right Wow I really need to shave hey guys Carsten rehnquist year if you've been,0.07108381
to any movie in the last few months you've probably seen the trailer for a,0.033210475
little movie called a star is born this film was been getting a lot of,0.09240397
buzz and it stars Lady gaga and Bradley Cooper who I believe also directed it,0.280691
it's a remake of the original 1977 film and it's been getting a lot of,0.06598166
buzz like I just said so of course I had to see it now based,0.12491276
on the trailer and the poster this really didn't seem like my type of thing,0.06237253
it seemed more like a film for people that live in the suburbs who also,0.11167612
have Waller above their leather couches that says live laugh love and thing is this,0.10412385
movie is not at all like that it's not at all what it was promoted,0.09383304
as in my opinion it seems like a story that's all about this woman's rise,0.3063173
to fame but at least to me it was more about this old country stars,0.09454712
battle with addiction and alcoholism it's actually a pretty heavy film that deals with some,0.08999066
very dense subject matter and I feel like it tackled these subjects incredibly well my,0.16261312
thing with a star is born' is that it's essentially a few different movies these,0.09428442
characters go through different stages of their lives and careers and with each stage comes,0.070324466
a different movie to me and while some of these stages felt very consistent and,0.06122447
good others didn't making the whole film in general feel a little messy I guess,0.06900983
I should address the first stage the the coming-up era which in my opinion was,0.05900928
done the absolute best I think this section of the film is almost flawless it's,0.054164596
amazing there's really nothing to not enjoy about it I loved the acting I loved,0.15350544
the writing the pacing the cinematography all of it felt so fragile and careful and,0.08961595
I loved how it was done it was some of the most enjoyable and smoothest,0.10100928
filmmaking I've seen all year but then as Ally our main character started to get,0.035090547
bigger and her relationship with Jack seemed to get a bit more complicated similar to,0.10065035
the characters the film got really out of control whereas in the first section the,0.050308745
film really had a clear grasp on what these characters wanted and who they were,0.14956634
throughout the remainder of the film they seemed to lose that grasp as each character,0.11525749
seemed to separate further from each other it felt like they took a lot of,0.055619515
time to craft those first 30 minutes and then seemed to rush the rest of,0.08073382
the film to me the heart of this was the editing I felt like the,0.07283314
editing was super awkward and rushed it's very clear that there were scenes that they,0.24806117
really wanted to hold on and focus on but due to time constraints they probably,0.033188086
had to cut them down the movie is already 2 hours and 13 minutes as,0.2994645
is so it would not surprise me if they wanted to cut this thing down,0.3435724
for the sake of selling more tickets this film at one point would spend like,0.054144964
20 seconds on a certain location and then move on to the next and repeat,0.071560875
that over and over again but it wasn't like a montage that's just how the,0.08197645
film went it made a very smooth and kind of calm drama feel way more,0.060180217
chaotic and fast-paced than it needed to be a clear example of this is when,0.099313155
Jack proposes to Ali out of nowhere it was like the weirdest edit I saw,0.10004948
this year it was just so fast and awkward and uncomfortable the whole audience was,0.08173272
just like wait what my last major flaw with the film it would be how,0.09394484
many different times it ended you think it's over and then it's not and then,0.12551354
it keeps going and then they build it up into the ending and then you're,0.14859852
like oh this is not the ending and then it repeats that over and over,0.08597719
and over again the issue here is that on paper this isn't actually that bad,0.08068418
of an ending it actually kind of makes sense it was just pasted and edited,0.091924034
so awkwardly to make you feel like it was coming to an end when in,0.078655705
reality you still have like 20 minutes left I will say the film did have,0.084346496
a lot going for it though the clear highlight that a lot of people are,0.06283011
talking about is the acting everybody is talking about how amazing Lady Gaga is and,0.15226607
yeah they're right she killed it especially for someone who has limited to no acting,0.5252574
experience but in my opinion I think Bradley Cooper did just as good if not,0.10368909
better he destroyed this performance I mean I mean like maybe the best of the,0.18091175
year he totally became this character in a really dark way that left me at,0.06470305
the edge of my seat also that sweet southern accent I mean oh I hear,0.0818057
a lot of people complaining about the cinematography of the film and to be honest,0.07434998
I kind of disagree a lot of the shots are very claustrophobic there are either,0.11781373
mediums or close-ups and I think this really enhances the feel that this film is,0.14467305
going for it's really not a controlled environment that these characters are living in and,0.051499162
while the tight editing didn't do much for me this claustrophobic cinematography really worked and,0.1163891
of course I can't really talk about this film without mentioning the music specifically shallow,0.12386199
which is basically already won the Oscar for Best Original Song it was great it,0.036777552
gave me goosebumps I listened to it on the way home not much to say,0.2413015
that hasn't already been said overall a star is born was basically built to win,0.05179543
Oscars but I can't really complain I think it'll deserve every nomination and or win,0.14197028
that it gets read Lee Cooper will get a Best Actor nomination Lady Gaga will,0.058190804
get a Best Actress nomination and as we all know shallow would you know yada,0.10291935
yada yada but to be honest I'm not too upset about it I think it,0.13711974
definitely deserves these it's a powerful film that definitely deserves the hype it's been getting,0.14867757
even though it's a little messy and overstays its welcome just a tad I'm gonna,0.23994851
give a star is born' a 3.5 out of 5 thank you all so much,0.051467083
