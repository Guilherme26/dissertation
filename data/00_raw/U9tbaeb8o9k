whoo you got another hit on your hands so me you got another hit on your hands I would like to say to all the fans which I'm going to play a game boss ah of spider-man which frond again that I think the overwhelming majority of you are going to love this movie there was plenty of fanservice in this movie there is fourth wall breaking there are cameos made there are plenty of Easter eggs and callbacks it was a great movie I had a very good time as a spider-man fan it was heartwarming it was there was plenty of action plenty of jokes and planning a web slinging and that it's sad moments to definitely uh tugged at the heartstrings a little bit there so if you don't know there's a movie called spider-man into the spider verse and it's all about no no no it's all about Miles Morales and him running into Peter Parker and several other spider people from the spider verse and they have to foil the kingpins plans with some things that have caused the problem and predicament that they're actually in there you have our movie and first of all I'd like to say that I did love the animation the animation reminded me of claymation you guys understand or know what claymation is it's from my date I remember in the days of 80s and watching Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer stuff like that I don't know if they were all clay but I know they were stop-motion but it's the name given to kind of like you know the stop-motion clay figures and stuff like that in the children's films when I was little I remember it hearing that name and it reminded me of that in that it was it was fluid but choppy at the same time if you've seen the trailers you already understand what the animation looks like you know what I mean there's something's almost like there's a frame missing like it's like if the animation frame was like if the frames animation like five there's like one missing all the time or something I don't know one than one one even miss event one didn't miss and I don't know I understand how they got it to look like that but I liked it I saw it in 3d and I must say I didn't need to see it in 3d because I couldn't tell that much no sort of 3d movies you go see in 3d you're like wow I can really yeah I don't need to see this is 3d but the kind of collector I am and I do blot by this little blue ray I will get it in 3d I gotta say that movie was a little slow in the beginning but it definitely picked up and I enjoyed the story of Miles Morales I am old-school spider-man fan I know of miles but I don't know miles and I really never cared for the character of Miles Morales until now I did like the way the movie portrayed him his relationship with his father his mother his uncle and I liked the way they brought the other spider people including Peter Parker into his universe and was it was interesting how that was done and I was thrown off by something that happens in the beginning because I was saying wait a minute I'll say oh yeah wait a minute that was a different color so you guys all know what I'm talking about when you do see the film I like the dynamic between him and Peter miles learning to be spider-man I like to dynamic between all all of the spider people whether it was spider-gwen or you know Peter porker or Spider noir or it there were several spider people in there so I'm telling you the movie was good the pink the King pig pink in the kingpin was rather badass and bigger than I thought he was gonna be like some reason I didn't realize he was in the movie I don't know why but I think he was shown in the trailers but I just never guy no he was big but they'd really go for super-sized him in this several other villains you will find out art in this movie and will make an appearance and I don't know what else to say man it was badass it was badass I had a good time other than it being a little slow in beginning I had time love the animation love the voice-acting voice acting was great the story was good I liked it a lot and I was surprised several times in the movie I was saying twice twice at the most I'm thinking twice two maybe three I think it was twice no three times there are three moments that kind of shocked me I was like wow no but you guys are going to absolutely enjoy this I'm going to give spider-man into the spider-verse I 4.5 out of 5 Woo's so make sure you go check it out let me know what y'all think and if you enjoy the Model T review me she hit the like button subscribe and share two million subscribers woo you may now subscribe
