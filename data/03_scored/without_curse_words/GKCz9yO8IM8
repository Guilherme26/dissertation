you know to be straight up with you I almost drove like an hour on,0.29509932
my way to go see this film because literally this film was showing and one,0.08187293
theater near me which was by our our way and I can't believe yesterday was,0.12281442
Christmas that's insane but yeah because the day after it was so busy movie it,0.2397646
was it's chaos I've barely got a chance to see the film but I did,0.06301872
the shape of water the new newest film from Guillermo del Toro yeah and I,0.06591997
gotta say I really enjoyed this film I really did I there's a couple garage,0.14910375
side I have with this film but other than that I really really liked this,0.05500278
film this movie is it's very darkly cute and it's just so bizarrely weird and,0.12903054
just so just randomly just violent as and just jarring you know for example the,0.20816171
main character here let me bring up a quick quick image here the the main,0.050555702
character here who was doo doo doo doo doo beautifully played by Sally Hawkins I'm,0.15019178
not I'm not very familiar with her work but she is incredible in this role,0.08410892
why this is probably one of the most impressive female performances that's seen all year,0.085321635
okay she plays a mute she I mean she does speak but like she kind,0.25745943
of really doesn't but we'll get to that but mostly she really never speaks in,0.11216565
this film and she conveys so much to her body language in through sign language,0.4032139
it's just impressive I thought she was just terrific I thought the whole cast was,0.07199836
fine I don't know I mean I guess she would definitely be the stand performance,0.1674538
her and Doug Jones listen Doug Jones but but like the whole cast well I,0.076987565
take that back Doug Jones her and Michael Shannon those are definitely the stanza the,0.074458346
standouts everyone else acting-wise was completely convincing and they were just fine but yeah she,0.08057806
was incredible and Michael by the way by the way talking about the movie ban,0.09200174
jarring right when it was show like her daily routine like when the first shows,0.1233808
her again by completely naked getting into the bathtub and like like like most of,0.6645826
her day is cleaning and masturbating and just kinda like this mundane life you know,0.93236464
I was like what the what Del Toro's just one of the strangest like when,0.16446859
Michael Shannon was just just the out of his chick right and he was like,0.41235948
going to be quiet like whoa whoa just del toral he just he'll just go,0.4663276
left in the car if the car was the plot it'll just go left abruptly,0.087722555
just out of nowhere you know that one character was his name I think his,0.09405794
real-life name is Michaels the old barge Burt I I don't know I probably still,0.0957443
want another say his last name correctly before making the review but this guy right,0.14914319
here he places scientists but he plays like such a respectable just straight-up honest good,0.13614807
person I think it's character name is mr. Robert Hoffman or some but my god,0.08363104
I I loved his character he was just like just such a good man rightfully,0.0806368
so cared for this man played by Doug Jones who again Doug Jones good good,0.08235061
God I mean Hellboy Pan's Labyrinth like one day he needs to receive him and,0.17140031
Andy Serkis should receive some kind of Lifetime Achievement Award because honest to god he,0.09128889
is just exceptional as his creature like the the the the blend of practical effects,0.23980106
and CGI but mostly just practical effects on his body is incredible like and his,0.28747845
body language as his creature so convincing like you just utterly believe that he is,0.44606352
just this what they call amphibian man like he truly believe that he is his,0.17954487
fish man like a hundred and ten percent back at the end creature looks real,0.24031322
real as and it should because I was looking at some behind-the-scenes stuff and just,0.07395238
look at this thing like the amount of practical effects with this creature is just,0.18062823
mind-blowing it's insane but even when he blinks you know I'm just like is that,0.31089434
CGI did they find a way to do that practical is it like a you,0.14999287
know both worlds woven into each other like what the it's just masterful work when,0.1436271
it comes to the creature design and the sets as well I mean cinematography is,0.08120287
gorgeous it's definitely one of the best looking films of the year but actually paused,0.077994615
on the Scimitar ephie my god the opening leagoo big here for a second because,0.11512065
the opening tracking shot this opening moment right here which was done in one take,0.08016268
for the record okay well we're sort of wandering through this underwater house I'll be,0.07323577
honest with you I'll be straight up with you I'm not even entirely sure whether,0.31089434
this was practical or CG I'm assuming that this this shot must be a combination,0.13142814
of practical and CGI but I really don't know this whole goddamn sequence could be,0.7962894
totally practically done it could be a hundred percent real fall I know I don't,0.062033128
know I'm gonna say just because of how dreamlike it looks is a blend of,0.09276697
CGI and practical effects but either way the opening first sequence that's done in one,0.056491632
take or underwater going to zone house or interior of this room is extraordinary good,0.10935471
god some of the best semi tog Rafi here and throughout the film I've seen,0.06398096
all year it's it's very very impressive and also actually it we're gonna go big,0.053451784
one more time here the set design is particularly fantastic as well like in this,0.09445716
the place where Octavia Spencer and right Sally Hawkins right you have the place where,0.07504501
they work at as cleaning the women is just utterly fantastic with the sense like,0.46703288
the room that houses the amphibian man the fish guy where's that oh yeah there,0.15304902
it is it is just the attention to detail is just remarkable you know it,0.04315947
looks like just an actual place but I could go work at tomorrow like it's,0.097594894
it's insane and I know that the film takes place I think in like out,0.17861922
in 1962 or something like that but yeah really incredible sets Michael Shannon is goddamn,0.794439
fantastic in this film probably one of my favorite villains of the year he's just,0.12712505
like this perfectionist bigoted just darkly hilarious Vilnius guy you know like there's one scene,0.42985737
where he's in the bathroom taking a piss and this one literally it's just like,0.46422404
literally taking a piss on the stall just like this talking to Octavia dispenser and,0.5646513
Sally Hawkins you know saying I was like what a bat if you if you're,0.34573585
just just openly conversating when someone taking a piss like that you are the man,0.6364068
okay what the this man had his his fingers written ripped off tried to have,0.40323597
them put back on and then later like we're Moo them from their attendance out,0.13012426
what the this man is insane um he was just such a perfect villain he,0.5436064
was so good there's one sequence where just general he was like he was talking,0.06830382
to like some some head guy some general Michael Shannon he was just like well,0.15184416
you know if I failed once you know me for 13 years if I failed,0.17205334
one time I mean they really make me a failure you know what done for,0.18088105
you and there's just like a certain look that Michael Shannon gave the general before,0.10602365
the general started talking again and also Jesus Christ I've never even seen that kind,0.1517922
of body language from Michael Shannon like this man is truly an exceptional actor it's,0.24012844
just his acting it's very nuanced it's very subtle you know it could be easy,0.08526193
for someone to be like I don't understand why is acting so great it's the,0.12924606
little details and there's mannerisms that make him so good um another thing that really,0.07364969
liked is there's a lot of small moments they actually meant something and it wasn't,0.055487882
just random for example when he's just just going ham you know having sex was,0.614251
with his chick right it would be easy to dismiss that seeing us like the,0.27338502
was that dealt or outside the leak some of his sexual fantasies and to the,0.6017574
family that was was just Brandon but no because later on the film when he's,0.089816414
talking to Sally Hawkins and he's like so uh you know I like some of,0.21904542
you meets you know do you squawk you wanna know squawkers yeah I like living,0.31586814
to be quiet you know you know there's there's that connection there you know or,0.068199165
what what else there's just so many like when what's-his-name is it Richard Jenkins I,0.06499538
think it's his name really great after yeah Richard drink is shout out to that,0.13898754
man fantastic act I've been on been in all kinds of right there's a scene,0.16409546
where he crashes his car into Michael Shannon's new Cadillac I think it was Cadillac,0.09037618
but he crashes his car into the Michael Shannon's new new new vehicle that he,0.077490784
just bought right and when I was first watching this I was like come on,0.096307896
movie the dumbest thing you'll make the character do some of that dumb but that,0.9017539
Carly crash into just so happen to be Michael Shannon's car that was like oh,0.16344886
oh nice hey you sneaky movie you love that that's interested interested I just a,0.15415587
little details well that's more like a whole list other ones that I couldn't think,0.07531995
of but that type of stuff was cool um I guess oh and this scene,0.121781126
right here has got to be one of the battleship it's gotta be one of,0.052692592
the best scene transitions I've seen in a movie all goddamn here I've never seen,0.7450969
no like this well she's like she's touching into the window and like we zoom,0.3202961
in crazily to these water droplets I'm talking like zoom zoomed in right and the,0.104432166
way that it the cross fades into the next scene is just brilliant a lot,0.055471726
of really cool visual techniques going on in this film oh stop the stream but,0.10184395
what else what else can't say this was a really fantastic film um I guess,0.09442751
let's talk about let's talk about the flaws really quick cuz there's just two main,0.07544308
ones that held me back from really really loving this film am I can people,0.16896991
see me oh you can good alright so number one uh well this one might,0.095276065
be a nitpick perhaps blood maybe I'll talk to sell to be a nitpick but,0.15185142
I really didn't buy the fact that like just on site as soon as she,0.0911332
first was in the presence of the creature like here and also during where's the,0.15395175
sequence where she's standing before the creature for her for her for her very first,0.15930636
time right here as well you mean to tell me that this guy damn character,0.8711175
was never afraid what time that she's in this creatures presence she was she showed,0.2980372
like no substantial acts of fear just as like the whole time she was like,0.105901875
like I know it's like 1962 and maybe she's a maybe just as a weird,0.25677568
person but like it's like anybody seeing this creature for the first time should be,0.30327997
under to some goddammit sense like if I'm saying that goddamn thing like that for,0.7994053
the first time I Billy hey family got some promise in there oh hey man,0.1160532
hey what's that hey y'all what's that wait raise my paycheck what's that yeah I,0.07422275
mean like I would be happy pissing myself with fear all right I just thought,0.55802023
those kind of ridiculous um but I guess my biggest gripe in this film would,0.6620637
be the relationship between her and the this fish man like I just don't think,0.26554403
that they completely nailed this relationship between the creature and her for me personally it,0.2165906
is sweet it is cute but I felt like you know by the time we,0.11388469
get to the third act more she's trying to break the creature out I feel,0.25053197
like by that time I should have been like like oh my god I hope,0.079704516
they stayed together I hope nothing happens to him oh nothing happens to the fish,0.1431683
man and that that never happened like during a sequence where Michael Shannon is torturing,0.25487214
the speech of this fish man Oh like I felt bad but I wasn't really,0.17690325
that bothered you know like when I was watching Peter Jackson's King Kong and when,0.09582618
King Kong is being shot at in the third act I mean I was almost,0.35656276
like I'm almost in tears every time I see that sequence and King Kong because,0.05952932
Peter Jackson is such a masterful job and making King Kong's it's so incredibly sympathetic,0.28167108
and just totally nail the chemistry and relationship between Cohn and Naomi Watts you know,0.056939866
so by time I'm saying King Kong being hurt like it's literally torturous look at,0.19287044
the screen I didn't get that when the fish guy who's being tortured I don't,0.23967656
think that they really nailed the relationship personally you know like it's almost like by,0.083342806
the time we get to the third act and when we got there like I,0.052951455
kind of knew we were in the third act fish guy in her like this,0.1654238
first weakest link in the third act like but God she like literally like has,0.1783207
sex I mean it's implied but she like has sex with the fish guy you,0.77924967
know saying in like I like it you know it's sweet but I just wish,0.08046016
I had a deeper connection you know to watching them on screen I wish I,0.09746207
had more of an emotional response to watching them on screen I'm saying because special,0.10782516
dance third act when Michael Shannon just straight up literally shoots the fish guy and,0.41411355
shoots her you know I'm saying it was shocking but it was it was just,0.74112785
surprising because it was shocking and it wasn't shocking because I was like oh no,0.07864674
I just saw two characters that I've grown to love for two hours he's shot,0.26151094
it wasn't like that it's just like god damn I got bleep del Toro did,0.794439
that good you know so yeah and unfortunately that's like a big cog in the,0.15441166
machine to not really like that much in the film you know the relationship between,0.08860466
her and fish guys so that was only real main negative I think the relationship,0.2832632
between the two could have been more better executed I suppose other than that I'm,0.19083895
feeling like a 9 yeah I'm 9 9 10 I mean the film is gorgeous,0.09612859
looking the acting is stellar across the boards the music was lovely you know I,0.069562264
thought the writing was very good there was definitely strict attention paid to these characters,0.08059435
because each character was very distinctive I just wish I could have nailed the relationship,0.11543767
more see ya feelin like a 9 9 10 forth it's it's definitely probably del,0.1384602
Toro's best film in a long long time because crimson peak was like yeah oh,0.07906479
yeah I loved like the final like 10 15 minutes but everything else besides looking,0.100163646
visually gorgeous was just laying yeah Pacific Rim was it just pure meant for me,0.19050092
you know um yeah yeah this is definitely his best film this far bow would,0.07656432
you think yeah would you think about this this thing let me know your thoughts,0.1003627
down below and that's it I'm out I thought oh I'm not if we make,0.099304274
sure to smash that like button comment subscribe all that jazz I'm gonna be laying,0.2974292
up prepare to get bombarded by reviews because I'm literally off work until 2018 so,0.0821776
there's a lot coming at you there's some top-ten lists coming at you so get,0.14682145
