John Krasinski delivered with that said let's talk about the good and the best thing,0.040447824
about this movie is that it just manages to build this sense of tension throughout,0.03132882
the entire movie right from the very beginning of the film it just screeched this,0.038317904
atmosphere where you know anything could happen that creates a sound and it could go,0.04083363
horribly wrong and right from the get-go it establishes the stakes the world around us,0.09814651
and the rules for how we need to function it establishes right out of the,0.041403692
gate this means the whole rest of the movie we have this sense of tension,0.031233033
and deep emotion from beginning to end and the reason this works is the premise,0.02660136
is very simple and straightforward there's creatures that attacks sound so if humans make noise,0.08260184
they will die very simple setup and it's the story that only is talking about,0.22291301

to tell a story about civilizations and decline it's a simple story about a family,0.01944731
trying to survive in this very simple premise and what that means is that we,0.015824053
notice all the details throughout the story because we're not being distress did buy all,0.025130639
the dialogue sorts of things well you notice all the details throughout the film in,0.018255966
order to show you a small detail a toy something at the house something making,0.0888692
that could potentially make some noise and instantly you feel all the tension because you,0.068669565
see everything that can go wrong with that in with that and with that doubt,0.035402402
the whole movie and as it goes through things Kaczynski will just linger for just,0.025070107
a second too long on something and by too long I mean so you're you,0.0744713
know you're supposed to notice it too long in the right sense and so you,0.032983795
see it and you can just get this lingering sense of Doom surrounding the smallest,0.043312103
details about this house about the family about the little choices that they make and,0.009887955
it just builds this incredible sense of tension and the way it's crafted as a,0.0437611
movie is that it starts out kind of slow as we're building the world what,0.0320705
does their life look like what's the dynamics of the family what have they gone,0.034113944
through what are the hurts and pains of being in this scenario and then it,0.06030688
gets going and once it gets going it just does not let up for the,0.039476655
entire life second half of the movie it just is so tense and you can,0.05037702
just see all the things that could potentially go wrong with the scenario they're going,0.032001983
in it's a movie this is so wonderfully crafted to take full advantage of every,0.042247143
scenario that would happen with the world that they built that the scenario that these,0.047681693
characters are and and the acting thread is just great the use of sound is,0.010415445
wonderful the use of music is great and the thing that I knew going into,0.03331373
it that it was going to have some great thrills to it because I'd heard,0.03837245
that from everyone they didn't seen it what I didn't realize going into it is,0.012053127
the level of emotional depth that it would be able to pull out of this,0.024726871
situation it find the little details the the right dynamics they're just the whole movie,0.017379252
there's this deep sense of emotion throughout the whole thing and that's what made this,0.011311448
movie so satisfying as you went through this journey and that has so little dialogue,0.053438857
but you feel so much without it needing to be set that's what that's great,0.03326384
filmmaking and that's a great example of what you can do with cinema where it's,0.019225802
a visual storytelling format and this is a movie that uses the visuals so wonderfully,0.015894564
and it's almost a perfect movie but not quite there's some problems with the movie,0.04425001
so move on to the bag is very few issues here and I can't go,0.029436372
too many details into it because it the two problems with it would be some,0.050716262
of the stuff where they go to the resolution where they try to tie everything,0.039760686
up and give you a satisfactory conclusion comes off a little bit contrived a little,0.061592013
bit like it's a movie that knows it needs to kind of come to a,0.105327174
satisfying conclusion and so the logic has to cheat a little bit with what they,0.08769715
show you with the amount of kind of backstory the amount of time that's passed,0.046087913
in this world it feels a little bit like it doesn't think she did a,0.06434455
little bit That's not me that's what I can't don't want to say too much,0.056128196
about it that's all I'll say cut about that one and then the second problem,0.04636596
time somewhat directly to that in the last ten minutes once again because they wanted,0.026695816
to have that nice satisfactory conclusion it feels a little bit out of step with,0.04581519
some of what happens in the final ten minutes what I wanted to say too,0.039905697
much if you've seen the movie you probably know what I'm talking about feels a,0.025216447
little bit out of step but these are very minor criticisms of the movie ah,0.06886846
here's what I'll say this is a movie that is within inches of fully accomplishing,0.030722838
its ambitions it's a movie that was trying to be one thing and it's this,0.04407374
close to being a perfect version of that they just had to cheat just a,0.10517351
little bit to get it get it there I'm gonna give this one an A,0.043830946
and an honor to tamp entertainment level I would give this one a 9 out,0.04333206
of 10 it delivered absolutely the experience I wanted I had a blast with this,0.04133052
movie it's it's not a movie that's trying to be the greatest of all time,0.053649057
