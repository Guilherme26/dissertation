Park family guy Django Unchained that was nice anyway black Klansmen tells the true story,0.3260186
of Ron stallworth and the movie played by John David Washington the first black officer,0.002090483
in the Colorado Springs Police Department assigned to the undercover division he decides to just,0.039278183
cold call up the Klan to open an investigation and infiltrate their organization posing as,0.16326295
a white man on the phone duh and using the fellow officer named Flip played,0.35199976
by Adam driver for their face-to-face encounters how do you propose to make this investigation,0.15204653
well establish contact over the phone we'll need a white officer to play me when,0.15328008
they meet face to face and for the white race Ron oh how are you,0.59673226
so there becomes a combined Ron stall work can you do that with the right,0.104044095
white man we can do anything this movie isn't really a comedy like at all,0.54377776
but that is an objectively hilarious line also kind of funny that this is the,0.091195844
second movie I saw this year where a black dude masquerades as a white dude,0.53490317
on the phone as a means to an end as always we'll be getting that,0.03798531
out to you right away and yeah even though black clansmen is title and premise,0.24258007
is reminiscent of a classic Chappelle's Show sketch and it started life as a Jordan,0.109976016
Peele project before get out took off and Jordan Peele became a way more in-demand,0.09139589
director and it seems on its face to be exactly the kind of thing he,0.22328962
Neal would have done on their comedy sketch show the movie is a pretty straight,0.18844311
drama it doesn't really treat the KKK as a punchline well a little bit because,0.15533337
he kind of have to but also not really like here's a clip from the,0.15196186
trailer you're a Jewish that hatred doesn't that piss you off you're taking this June,0.77056044
lie-detector test I get the sense that you're kind of supposed to laugh at that,0.33704752
and yeah it's funny that that guy thinks that there's a distinction between lie detectors,0.22356606
and Jula detectors but in the actual movie that's a really intense scene put that,0.046901375
strap on your arm put it on your arm I've listened to a few interviews,0.45128953
with the railroad stallworth and you should too there are plenty out there and he,0.05995351
said that while he his co-worker certainly did think of the kk k-- were morons,0.9156528
and they laughed about them behind their backs you know like Janis Ian visibie Regina,0.17086472
George he also never lost sight of what they represented that they're a hate group,0.4349598
they're dangerous they're gun nuts and extremely well armed and they're organized Imperial tax to,0.31861523
become a member ten dollars for the year fifteen dollar Chapter three robes and hoods,0.065512784
are not included that's extra and I think the movie really captures that tone well,0.049866077
it walks a tonal tightrope between the absurdity of the premise and the severity of,0.40320793
the reality Spike Lee has said that his biggest challenge was getting the tone right,0.14868367
and that was the most important thing to get the movie to work the other,0.069599904
thing he had to do to get the movie to work was and his words,0.10298324
connect the past with the present and I think that part might have been easier,0.07019832
than nailing down the tone maybe if this movie had been made five or ten,0.19300699
years ago balancing the drama and comedy would be the easy part and connecting it,0.086118706
to the present would be the hard part but here we are and Spike Lee,0.05783401
is not just juggling tone but also different themes and story elements ron has a,0.04099307
blossoming romance with the president of the Black Student Union named Patrice played by Laura,0.018742133
Harrier which is complicated by her lived experience of black people and police being ODS,0.40310207
and by Ron's duality of being both black and police this is also a buddy,0.08636196
cop movie of sorts a very unique brand of one it's also an undercover behind,0.1021877
enemy lines story and every time flip is around Klan members it's very very tense,0.26592857
say what rap did that peckerwood had a gun in my face he was away,0.53490317
from pulling the trigger and he didn't but he could have and as mentioned this,0.19592808
is also explicitly a movie about someone breaking the color barrier and Ron must always,0.11572278
keep a cool head and be better than anyone else around him to get by,0.19138865
and sometimes that's a struggle and while the movie doesn't explicitly connect this dot it,0.054764017
dances around the possibility that Colorado Springs PD only hired a black officer in order,0.09563516
to infiltrate the black organizations of the area like Patrice's Black Student Union to keep,0.31089434
an eye on them to make sure they weren't planning any violent attacks which is,0.17524043
kind of how Ron got the idea to run the same game on the KKK,0.15251169
pared down the movies largely about counterterrorism and along those lines apparently took some creative,0.109137595
liberties with the third act climax both to underscore the terrorism angle but also so,0.12500796
they could have a third act climax it's fine if not a little convenient the,0.14928453
KKK is planning an attack Wars at Commons and to circle back they kind of,0.3231761
market it as a comedy and they list comedy is one of its genre z',0.085972466
and there's a prologue with some stunt casting that's played more for laughs and the,0.103866965
rest of the movie but overall it's a movie that you wish was funnier but,0.0927975
it's kind of too real to really laugh at and it has a super powerful,0.072410114
ending that quashes any doubts you might have had about how much you're intended to,0.11392947
laugh at this I saw this in a large crowded theater and I know the,0.092404515
phrase you could hear a pin drop is cliche but I can't think of another,0.10131182
movie going experience where that many people were that quiet as the credits started to,0.11535445
roll the ending really shocks you into silence it's crazy powerful stuff the opening shot,0.40329245
of black Klansmen is the famous crane shot from Gone with the Wind that poignant,0.13984144
Lee ends with a waving Confederate flag there's a scene in the movie where Klan,0.101981774
members have a watch party of DW Griffith's Birth of a Nation movie whose heroic,0.17514557
portrayal of the Klan is largely credited with the group's resurgence in the 20th century,0.07260829
and the movie that David Duke actually did use as a KKK recruiting tool in,0.18554576
the 70s not unlike how this movie portrays it and there are a few clips,0.07410318
and references to some blaxploitation movies as those were really the only black movies made,0.283915
during this time period by including all these historic cinematic references and their portrayals of,0.058525335
race Spike Lee is making a clear point about the power of movies and in,0.14877747
particular how they can be used for good or for ill to shape culture and,0.10465598
societal norms and in black Klansmen particularly in its closing moments Spike Lee wields that,0.0018355858
