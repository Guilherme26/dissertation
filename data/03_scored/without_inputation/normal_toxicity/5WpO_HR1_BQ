you're gonna be glad you did as you know by now from the title we're,0.08647986
talking about spider-man into the spider verse and I'm gonna tell you why I loved,0.15067726
it and why I think it's one of the best feature links spider-man movies we've,0.089746036
ever gotten so stick around now unlike the spider-man films of the past this one,0.12323955
focuses on Miles Morales another normal kid that much like Peter Parker gets a spider,0.2597565
bite that transforms him into the very same hero that he knows from the comics,0.18141073
Morales has a lot of trouble coming to terms with his abilities and he absolutely,0.18194252
thinks he's alone until other versions of the hero from different dimensions including the famous,0.08408427
Peter Parker arrived in to his world and they're gonna need more alice's helps you,0.07495396
stop a threat to not only the dimension that morales knows his home but the,0.12387255
entire multiverse growing up spider-man was one of my favorite heroes but for the most,0.097107634
part his live adaptations other than Rama's first two films and the most recent homecoming,0.095222525
just haven't really connected to me that much spider-man was one of the few comics,0.099541076
I was able to get my hands on and read as a kid and unlike,0.32145327
other heroes the webslinger can very easily bring back that childhood nostalgia Morales was a,0.06302791
version of the story unfamiliar to me but regardless I felt like a kid again,0.08995834
watching this movie because it just captured that Spiderman atmosphere that I remember growing up,0.06684852
I thought it was an awesome blend of modern and retro it was pulled off,0.10672177
from a combination of elements but I think first and foremost the animation style was,0.044941824
fantastic and it was perfectly selected for this story it has like a London Street,0.04947051
Art vibe to it that I thought complemented the overall mood of the film very,0.062919006
effectively but it also has a blend of like pencil art and watercolor that make,0.066551395
it look like just storyboards pulled from the comic book pages itself it wasn't as,0.12234696
vibrant as you would expect from today's animated films but it still had plenty of,0.090490036
rich depth to it that I found to be more than immersive enough but to,0.08143291
me is equally impressive as the artistic appeal was I think the writing of both,0.05209719
the storyline itself and the dialogue was also excellent it was down-to-earth and blended with,0.05168869
just enough self-awareness historical away it was a - with some nice meta it created,0.103669524
an appealing range of personalities and character types that really grabbed on to me to,0.079275794
make me invest into this storyline the humor was very sharp it was witty and,0.08129276
I went in expecting a superhero adventure and not only did I get a great,0.0986018
one but I also got a great comedy as well I think the cast of,0.097752504
voice talent was fantastic from top to bottom they all brought life and emotion and,0.23122853
warmth to the characters by providing a ton of charisma through their vocal work I,0.055832
think this added with some already great dialog combined with a simplistic but very warm,0.16438296
art design just pumped a ton of life and charisma into this film to create,0.1878834
characters I genuinely cared about in a story that maintained my intrigue because of its,0.093942374
freshness I don't always get pulled into animated films despite thoroughly enjoying them but this,0.08091785
was the first one that I can remember in many years that completely consumed me,0.07574452
and made me feel like a kid again I appreciated how this movie explored the,0.15382607
world of spider-man in a very fun creative way that peeled back layers to the,0.15684299
universe I had never been able to experience before it created a blend of characters,0.08280618
that had me wanting to see more of them which is definitely a positive for,0.12019583
an animated film that's hovering at just under two hours and I know what's gonna,0.09703718
sound like it's cliche and a little bit exaggerated but this was an animated movie,0.14424664
that truly felt like it was pulled from the pages of a comic book I,0.14879133
loved how this film embraced new avenues in the spider-man universe it introduces the world,0.104558736
to Miles Morales and it creates a backdrop and a personality for him that I,0.15732348
think can connect to people as strongly as Peter Parker has over the years in,0.046459492
my opinion and I love the doors that this opens to exploring new characters in,0.05697882
this multiverse and while this doesn't really directly set up any sequels it definitely lays,0.08952756
the groundwork to many more stories that can be told but I do wish ahead,0.020719329
maybe focused a little bit more on Morales the first half of the film lets,0.10561341
us really get to know him I enjoyed what was there and I just really,0.037167832
wanted to see a lot more of that and as things continue in the plot,0.082986854
begins to evolve the focus begins to shift to a lot of the other moving,0.07713572
pieces and while I did enjoy where the story goes and how it comes back,0.059430227
to Morales I just honestly wanted to see more of him but that's not to,0.10156068
say that this wasn't an entertaining story because it absolutely as I loved it the,0.08701696
action sequences were amazing and adrenaline pumping the musical score was fantastic as well it,0.06693068
heightened every scene like it needed to and it only added to just the overall,0.17731251
mood and atmosphere of the story the attempts at humor were very effective the cast,0.050575953
pumped a ton of life into the film with their voiceovers and the hype for,0.09079135
this film being extremely high is warranted and to me spider-man into the spider-verse is,0.1517351
gonna get 95% on the entertainment meter I went into this one hoping for a,0.060130596
good spider-man movie and I walked out knowing I had just seen not only a,0.07187523
great movie but honestly my pick for the best animated movie of the year if,0.059405956
