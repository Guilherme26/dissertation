so those of you who have been following my Twitter,0.2420351
my tumblr my youtube channel may know I isn't looking forward to this movie for a long long time,0.066266306
I'm a huge fan of Wonder Woman as a character as a superhero,0.08758937
and when I saw the first couple trailers for this film I was pumped nervous but pumped,0.09377281
but after the positive review started coming I was so excited to get into the theater,0.075976774
today I went at 11 o'clock the very first showing it was a packed theater and for once for once I left out of a DC EU movie with a huge ass smile on my face,0.88824683
so those of you who may not know my history with the BC EU films unfortunately they are pretty similar to a lot of other people's feelings,0.1750426
I'm not a big fan of Man of Steel,0.10818342
I'm not a big fan of Batman V Superman and quite frankly,0.12389294
I can almost say I despised Suicide,0.37223455
Squad,0.038612
I did not like that movie very much,0.10096863
and so I was nervous,0.055058587
I was very nervous going into Wonder Woman but the minute it opened and I saw that beautiful first shot of Paris loop which I've actually been to it was,0.15678903
so cool seeing her you know walk down to the museum,0.2664982
because I'm like I've been there I've been when they filmed that part sorry little fangirl moment,0.0618376
but this whole movie was gorgeous the cinematography in this movie was beautiful Samus cura,0.110580266
I think they I think Sammis Kira the oceans and everything were in Italy,0.06523005
if I'm not mistaken but samus Kira was gorgeous absolutely beautiful,0.25286466
I kind of wished the the color palette in this movie would have kind of been at the height that Dennis,0.06082225
Carroll is but I can understand when you're dealing with a horror film especially if you're going into Europe during World War 1,0.31884152
it's going to be a little bit grim,0.4413893
but this movie was gorgeous,0.15428235
so the cinematographer great job patty,0.086098544
Jenkins,0.061716076
let me just say your direction in this cell was marvellous there were so many things in this movie that just worked,0.0996237
so well a lot of the problems of the other DC movies is,0.1016301
they don't know if they want to be dark or comedic this movie had an incredible balance there were,0.06358249
so many funny lines but at the same time they knew when to back away from that they knew when to get emotional they knew when to get dark or to get powerful or to get angry,0.11116951
and it was a perfect balance for when they did those things,0.06287249
a lot of the comedic aspects in this movie come from Chris Pine and let me just brag on Chris Pine for a bit guys I already love Chris Pine,0.14990795
I think he is one of the most underrated actors working in Hollywood I do not think he gets enough credit,0.116574004
he is phenomenal in this movie he is brilliant,0.14848945
I may say so is gal gadot or gadot I'm not quite sure how she pronounces her last name I'm so sorry I was a little worried about her don't get me wrong,0.14079455
I was one of those skeptical people around like,0.07801127
she hasn't done much outside of this,0.14790854
but let me see and she was wonderful,0.087481886
she captured that innocence that fish-out-of-water story so well her reactions to things you know having Chris Pine there to bounce off her Christine and gal had incredible chemistry their romance in this movie works so well and I got sucked in I normally don't get sucked into romances dealing with superhero movies very often,0.3967202
but this man who it got me and there are so many beautiful lines that the writers of this also congratulations because there are so many gorgeous lines specifically at the end which of course I'm not going to spoil but the ending is also wonderful they do,0.09501317
they do link it back to two Batman V Superman,0.09446086
so it is linked,0.05806855
but what I like is it's linked very slowly,0.0858797
you know there isn't a huge chunk of this movie that they go okay,0.113697425
we have to link it somehow we have to connect it to to do Batman and Superman and flash and the Justice League,0.046225302
no it's very small the connection is very small which I respect because I'm not here,0.077026956
you know to see AAA Batman Wonder Woman combination I'm here for Wonder Woman so they had a very small connection to Batman and Batman V Superman towards the end but that was that was about it which I appreciated,0.15169822
if I can say one thing the villain of the film was a little underwhelming again,0.31089434
I'm not going to give the spoilers but if I had to pick it would be the villain,0.13588159
the villain was very underwhelming,0.2822068
I don't think the villain was very well developed,0.12184928
I don't know,0.1431935
I don't know if it was because they were trying to do a fake out saying or if they were trying to you know put more emphasis on World War 1 which they do,0.120905235
but then in the third act when the villain comes out it's just kind of like okay,0.12678628
also I would say the movies are a little bit too long,0.14975311
I know two and a half hours nowadays and seem like too long,0.120411344
but there definitely were a couple of scenes specifically in London that I could say could have cut out but other than that like I said before this movie is gorgeous beautifully,0.10329635
written,0.057434026
beautifully directed beautifully acted,0.11494854
and I will not be surprised if we get an announcement like Wonder Woman two coming out in like a year because they need to jump on this if it has it already made eleven million dollars its opening day day,0.16030107
actually I don't even think it was the opening day,0.11402539
I think 101 made eleven million dollars,0.10117498
its preview night which is way more than they assumed,0.095749505
and you know it has incredible incredible ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and everybody is praised in the movie which it deserves,0.24053338
Oh God I I really wish I would make a spoiler review for this movie but I'm not going to I know a lot of other people have a lot of other movie reviewers have made much better spoiler reviews than I could do,0.07175881
but this movie is wonderful,0.0863843
