let's me black and bollocks be honest how many people are wearing this thing in the thumbnails of their videos and/or doing this well screw it I'm gonna do it too I'm gonna take,0.6884801
this thing to have an imprint in my head right now,0.33510244
so Wonder Woman is directed by patty Jenkins stars gal gadot this is a fourth DC film in the DC Cinematic Universe I believe it's the first live-action Wonder Woman movie a lot is riding on Wonder Woman for a lot of people in Wonder Woman we meet Wonder Woman aka Diana Prince he's an Amazon she loosens,0.11206617
the mascara which is an island of all warrior women should they have some authors lot of a warriors in a pilot named Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine crashes his plane on this island of all women first man Diane has ever seen he's a pilot from World War one and he tells tale of this huge war that's happening to Diane is like I'll go with you to your world and help stop this war,0.26526988
so now we have our Wonder Woman movie really the first half of this movie doesn't have all the crazy kick-ass,0.8265714
we you saw in the trailer,0.069931954
it really is her climatized to our world she enters our world she enters London,0.22055109
she really is a fish out of water which allows for a lot of comedy and I really feel that they got the comedy right in this movement kind of reminded me is in the vein of Crocodile Dundee how this person from this other land comes to what we know as normal and it is completely abnormal to them by normal,0.3145146
I mean it takes place in World War one so not a lot of people living today know that world as normal but there is a lot in that world that we still do know and relate to in our world,0.1290982
but Diana is completely bafflingly weird and talking about the comedy Chris Pine really adds a lot to that Chris Pine was great in this movie,0.15038355
he's just the perfect person to cast,0.17111221
you saw that in the trailer where she was like I was conceived by Zeus and he's like,0.1357069
well,0.039254032
that's me that timing that he has completely plays in this movie in plays wow I feel like Chris Pine even though he's been james t kirk is a completely underrated talent with great timing and delivery a gal gadot just wonder woman credit where credit's due when i heard she was a Wonder Woman I was like they got a model to be Wonder Woman okay what she put in the time she's all downes she's got biceps like she kicked,0.22594894
my ass,0.9572173
let's face it,0.18501487
she could have kicked,0.46650988
my ass when she was G before,0.94672936
she worked out for Wonder Woman but ask for Wonder Woman she completely played well didn't play perfectly like for example Chris Pine you look at him,0.08433981
there are very few people I could pick to play Steve Trevor as well as Chris Pine did / what they were going for I feel,0.037343603
like there are a few women out there who could have played Wonder Woman couple of the moments where she has to bring out the she brings out the emotion doesn't stick all of the,0.15258604
landing she's being honest however she did,0.15240103
play,0.05691247
well I didn't walk out of the movie going well she ruined it,0.18985902
I thought she was good but she really does shine in the action sequences,0.18762882
I don't know where the stunt person placed into this the Wonder Woman is kicking ashore like,0.23914021
yeah,0.040847696
this is pretty exotic that scene where she goes out in the battlefield,0.17360207
she's just taken all the fire with her shield that scene is as cool as you want it to be that happens about halfway through the movie when that scene happens on the movie moves just like alright,0.2323146
the fish-out-of-water thing,0.10440996
the funnies the camaraderie,0.15913896
it's gone time to move forward with the mission and it is some exciting stuff when the slow-mo starts happy there's a lot of slow-mo and the action sequences at first she's like yeah like matrix style,0.08178254
then later on you're like they use a lot of slow-mo for these action sequences,0.20193385
so really when an action sequence is going down,0.06098786
and there's no slow-mo,0.16085961
and it's just moving really fast to me that's more exciting but we'll really lock me into this movie was the humanity that Wonder Woman shows and really that is credit for patty Jenkins the director and gal gadot the actors yeah she's super and she can go toe to toe with Superman any day,0.18865113
but in the end she is a human being she feels pain,0.24050768
she feels lost,0.25930429
she feels pressure,0.10682776
and when she lets it all out,0.114793055
she can rage clear a room the movie although it has solid kick-ass hurry when it goes down is not an action centric movie it's actually a very personal story about Diana,0.5526205
it's a coming-of-age story,0.08589639
she doesn't really know all of her powers,0.24201597
so she's learning it as she goes along so they make Diana's strong in this movie without browbeating EULA,0.27127758
it's not like oh man bad Wonder Woman good because it's not really what it should be Wonder Woman is a strong character because she exhibits strength not because the men around her exhibit weakness,0.2418664
I thought that was a really important thing,0.061596777
there are a couple of great moments of heart,0.06285865
there is a scene where Steve Trevor and Diana are talking about humanity,0.055094194
it is probably my favorite scene in the movie she's such good dialogue,0.09329994
I'm not gonna tell you what it just really hit me guys in the end,0.39099443
I completely enjoyed Wonder Woman there are some problems with pacing,0.19282086
in the first part of the movie it is another big end fight that happens DC movies men they love their big n fights,0.17667478
I felt like by the end of the ending it came across it's a little cheap,0.1788535
but the movie as a whole has a lot of good payoff,0.06765128
there is a lot of pressure on this movie for a lot of people,0.09767383
there are people who want wonder woman to represent strong women,0.3263776
I totally get that,0.067708015
there are people who want Wonder Woman to save the DC Cinematic Universe for them,0.092634246
I totally get that,0.06770799
and there are some people who just want to enjoy a good movie I totally get that,0.06683946
and I think if you're any of those people you'll walk out a Wonder Woman like yeah it paid off Wonder Woman was fun,0.4459255
it was exciting Chris Pine was great,0.06489252
I think the director patty Jenkins really crushed I think they really utilized the fact that Wonder Woman takes place so far before the Justice League and all that stuff's going down you had the freedom to just break off and be its own movie,0.1547739
if you haven't seen any movies in the DC Cinematic Universe you could watch Wonder Woman and not be lost,0.17907162
there's one scene at the beginning that kind of ties it in a little bit but you don't need it though I feel like I kind of hamstrung myself on this one with the Suicide Squad which you remember my rating for Suicide Squad,0.1945274
yep there it is,0.038316533
yeah people on the internet loved their writings and this is better than Suicide Squad,0.40042213
so I will say Wonder Woman is worth watching and worth buying on blu-ray alright guys,0.26062098
