well Martin Luther King jr. finally get his turn in the Hollywood spotlight you're watching,0.10575187
beyond the trailers review of Selma you March those people into rural Alabama it's gotta,0.06797973
be open season have a word there are 70 million people watching these picks that,0.060654808
are going around the world and otherwise come to self I heard about the attack,0.16274117
of innocent people I couldn't just stand by looks like an army out there Malcolm,0.18399031
X has a movie Nelson Mandela has a movie Gandhi has a movie William Wallace,0.10273685
has a movie countless movies have been made about people who face similar insurmountable odds,0.15208824
yet still managed to change the world driven by a desire to see their people,0.18958054
no longer suffer so where is the Martin Luther King jr. movie why is Hollywood,0.15298392
ignored one of the most important historical figures in the 20th century who has been,0.12083685
honored in countless ways everywhere else including a national holiday well the sad reason is,0.05608429
that Luther's descendants have the rights to his speeches under a tight lockdown and licensed,0.4743313
those rights exclusively in 2009 to DreamWorks and Warner Brothers who are currently just sitting,0.056182995
on them after Oliver Stone decided not to direct an MLK jr. film after all,0.071919054
yes the Kings have a dream of getting paid so well they haven't come out,0.11606884
against Selma they haven't supported it either and the filmmakers here were forced to alter,0.07942539
every single line the Martin Luther King jr. spoke in public or else be sued,0.1020927
but well the Martin Luther King jr. estate has powerful sway over his legacy there,0.050375912
are powerful forces at work behind Selma Oprah Winfrey is a producer on the film,0.06025921
and a co-star which lends considerable credibility to the project and on top of that,0.060748413
Selma is also being produced by the team behind 12 years of slave Brad Pitt's,0.12554249
Plan B shingle headed up by Dede Gardner and Jeremy kleiner after dominating at last,0.07391234
year's Oscars the 12-years team clearly has some strong awards connections which has alright resulted,0.04062933
in numerous Golden Globe nominations for Salma including the first ever nomination for a black,0.076006465
female director Ava Duvernay as Martin Luther King jr. still opening doors for his people,0.29007673
Selma is also relevant today because of the nationwide protests over the deaths of Michael,0.10021322
Brown and Eric garner where there is a struggle between nonviolent and violent protesters Oprah,0.1880752
has already told the morning talk shows that she hoped Selma will inspire protesters to,0.067180425
lean more towards non-violence and to realize that strong leadership and a clear message are,0.11560199
vital to getting results then there's David Roy yellow the UK actor who American audiences,0.09172932
are certainly familiar with but probably still can't name check will this be a star-making,0.026076766
turn or go largely unrecognized on interest elbows mandela having now seen Salma I can,0.07203067
say that it's not only one of the top ten films of the year but,0.06332952
one of the top films in recent memory it really does deserve to have the,0.06343727
kind of Oscar nominations that Birdman boyhood and the grand Budapest hotel are enjoying and,0.076745816
it's truly tragic even more so that David O yellow and especially Ava Duvernay are,0.08011688
not nominated for their work is the Academy racist because of that well that's a,0.3312182
really difficult and potentially loaded question but I think the bigger culprit is the marketing,0.055417545
campaign for the film yes once again publicity kills another movie but there's a lot,0.18526714
more at stake this time than just entertainment value and when I say publicity I,0.0831181
mean the awards campaign but also the marketing for the general public because let's face,0.080453046
it seeing Selma based on the advertising material seems like a chore it seems like,0.13872105
a TV movie as I stated in my trailer review the poster is just the,0.07909553
back of Martin Luther King Junior's head I mean how uninspiring is that who says,0.40524554
that's the movie I want to see right now that's that's so totally a rental,0.0869409
and this is so not totally a rental type of movie and I don't understand,0.095565535
why a Hollywood Society and pretending particularly education system refuse to define Martin Luther King,0.113612965
and when you see this movie you see how horrible that is and how this,0.4335877
is a man who's been robbed of his legacy I mean forget the Oscar nominations,0.24659792
for the film the much bigger crime is that we do not remember what happened,0.08240271
here now this is a film that works on two levels and the first one,0.061861534
I want to discuss is its emotional qualities I haven't had this kind of an,0.106460206
emotional reaction to a movie since The Passion of the Christ and I recently detailed,0.1104461
what a strong emotional reaction I had to that film now The Passion of the,0.06728894
Christ still had had the bigger reaction and someone isn't quite at that level but,0.10303651
it's darn close and Ava Duvernay does an incredibly impressive job of not just humanizing,0.62984425
dr. King but his followers that's one thing that makes this movie truly special then,0.08811356
it's not just oh it was all Martin Luther King jr. it shows that only,0.16184705
and how his support team helped him but the people who risk their lives to,0.09744509
follow him and March with him and it shows the bravery of a non-violent movement,0.14916918
it's just it's incredible to watch and there are similarities to you know Jesus Christ's,0.09026397
sacrifice and he also turned the other cheek it's just incredibly powerful Oprah Winfrey has,0.13192344
an amazing scene with trying to register to vote it's just brilliantly done and then,0.09924615
the story of Jimmie Lee Jackson and his family will move you beyond words I,0.055598956
think everybody should know that man's name and the fact that they don't just once,0.09592463
again underlines how little attention is being paid to the civil rights movement and that,0.110194005
these memories are not being carried forward now I said this worked on two levels,0.07664223
so on one there's the emotional situation that you know hits you right out of,0.15075077
the gate I don't want to give it away but the movie made me jump,0.114522435
in one of its opening sequences it just rips your heart out fittingly you know,0.1600403
it's not sensationalized it's very real actually incredibly well grounded but then it's also an,0.078601755
amazing political film it reminds me a little bit of Lincoln where it shows the,0.08428864
backroom politicking and of course the movie shows what a brave person Martin Luther King,0.15152766
jr. was and what a great speaker he was but I've never before seen or,0.10020029
even seen and hinted that he was a great political tactician which he clearly was,0.07980947
and I can't believe that after having gone through the education system of this country,0.08020602
and you know being plugged into the media and celebrating a bunch of Martin Luther,0.13701124
King days no one has been able to explain to me until this film why,0.08533108
voting was so crucial to the civil rights movement and it's done eloquently here beautiful,0.12652972
and they really show the genius and why hundred years after the Civil War Martin,0.09216291
Luther King was finally able to find a way to crack this blockade that had,0.1770544
been put up by discrimination I mean it's just really really impeached of politicking and,0.17900416
it also underscores the importance of getting involved in your community and trying to work,0.099375665
within the system instead of just railing against it as I think sometimes people tend,0.09961795
to do and they're always unsuccessful and this movie shows that you're only going to,0.29076186
succeed if you wrestle with the Beast I know also LBJ a lot of people,0.41387358
have criticized this film for I'm not a good depiction of our former president I,0.09342752
think that's not true I think it's a very favorable depiction of LBJ as a,0.12948853
man of his times dealing with a very difficult situation and he had to make,0.101405546
the hard choices that again reflected the era that he lived in and the different,0.059229877
two different constituents that he deal with there's a great moment in the film where,0.027239446
LBJ points out that is an activist Martin Luther King jr. has only one cause,0.14467604
where he has a ton of causes that he has to deal with and I,0.10477043
think the film was in fact quite sympathetic to LBJ supposition and the way that,0.04986051
he and art Luther King jr. kind of do the dance politics is brilliant to,0.12727904
behold I also want to point out that I think that the reason that it,0.07729196
says that LBJ comes to the decision to do what he does in the end,0.07171137
obviously you know some people I could see would be like well that's not very,0.10633658
nice because you know he has a conversation with George Wallace and I don't want,0.15230386
to give anything away basically you know and she doesn't do it because it's the,0.095280245
right thing he does it because he doesn't want to be on the wrong side,0.10494981
of history but hey you know what that's a very realistic reason to be motivated,0.060494732
to do something and I actually found it quite refreshing to see such stark realism,0.1814212
in the depict of our leadership and you know I saw someone say oh this,0.082297206
is just gonna say Martin Luther King jr. was the saint I think this movie,0.10898972
was very respectful of him but it does acknowledge his flaws particularly a very big,0.10786302
one that he has within his family which you know I think another movie maybe,0.0807117
wouldn't have gone there but this one does and I think it's just it's impressive,0.08835072
across the board and I would say Ava Duvernay David Olo very talented here but,0.08823851
the real talent here is Duvernay and I think that she has the strongest voice,0.32379943
of all the creative voice and all the female directors working right now and if,0.15186784
she can avoid going too girly with future projects and she just continues to make,0.12639311
movies that are not gender specific like Selma I think she could go all the,0.19390462
way where's Kathryn Bigelow you know kind of fainted away after winning her Oscar and,0.17496344
you know hasn't really continued to work and been a you know someone who contributes,0.12490921
to the creative community of filmmaking I think do marinate you know she didn't get,0.0858825
a nomination here but I'm very excited to see what she does next so I,0.1227264
really recommend that you see this movie and I can see why you know people,0.16387199
maybe don't want to see it because again the marketing is so bad and also,0.23884174
this is a hard thing to take and people just forgotten about civil rights in,0.12761845
general I again I think it's appalling that I have learned so much from this,0.17007491
movie that I should have known beforehand and I can understand that it's a difficult,0.055841662
conversation to have and then it's people maybe just want to forget that this ever,0.059787095
happened that it was so soon it was just 50 years ago basically but you,0.06600662
know what you don't have to remember it all the time and we've made progress,0.09155528
and in some ways we haven't but if this movie really shows and underlines that,0.110062815
you know when you should remember all of this and you should honor not just,0.08041696
Martin Luther King jr. but his followers on Martin Luther King jr. Day and this,0.13092692
is a film that I don't even go so far as to say should be,0.121010505
played every year on Martin Luther King jr. Day just as they play the Ten,0.05992816
Commandments on Easter it's that powerful and I think it's that important so definitely go,0.10249809
and see it and I hope hopefully David oil particularly Ava Duvernay will get their,0.12455225
due on the next go-around so thank you so much for tuning in thank you,0.108787894
