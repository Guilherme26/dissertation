out I first want to talk about a very sensitive subject racism because in one,0.2896982
way or another this one we does deal with racism and I want to give,0.37839887
you my quick thoughts on the subject in life people are people there's a lot,0.14926518
of cool people that you meet along the way that come in every shape in,0.18948984
color and there's a lot of heads that you meet along the way that come,0.15095958
in every shape and color and to wrap up my thoughts my motto is people,0.11958239
are like Sour Patch Kids they come in every color but no matter what they're,0.18211202
all delicious did I just compare sour patch kids to racism at six o'clock in,0.4763088
the morning let's talk about the movie get out a black guy meets his white,0.6255598
girlfriend's creepy and mysterious family the movie get out as a horror mystery thriller so,0.3149805
spent with a heavy dose of comedy and going into this movie I had no,0.107171886
idea how heavy-handed this movie was with a comedy throughout and at times it is,0.119899124
very subtle and I appreciate very subtle comedy because in my opinion that makes things,0.13687645
even funnier letting the film get out there's very intense serious situations where one of,0.04506134
the characters just makes an offhanded comment that's funny that relates and makes sense during,0.057710107
the situation but you as an audience laugh at it because it adds a certain,0.13480487
level of levity and I liked that about this movie but as far as comedy,0.21049006
goes the main characters best friend named rod is pretty much the main comedic relief,0.05807525
of the movie and there's three or four scenes where he references crazy white people,0.6468722
kidnapping them eating their heads and using them as sex slaves and I was like,0.8606264
yeah I that's funny so like I said before the main plot of this movie,0.0906269
is a white girlfriend takes her black boyfriend home to meet her white parents and,0.35132548
everyone in this family is very eccentric very weird and creepy and you just get,0.37282687
this vibe that something bad is looming it's a very suspenseful film I was really,0.13167815
on the edge of my seat at times wondering what's going to happen how's this,0.07825799
all going to turn out and along the way you're laughing at the sad tires,0.1877766
and the stereotypes that the movie is making fun of when it comes to the,0.05267667
writing of this film I thought the most clever thing it did was you'd expect,0.17638054
all these white old crusty people to be racist no one comes across truly racist,0.74448884
in this film yes they do stereotype things but no one really makes a ray,0.07541286
this remark the white family in the film actually goes so far as to say,0.25980777
that black people are genetically gifted and they're almost envious of that and when it,0.66658723
came to that approach I was actually surprised by that because I was expecting a,0.055654917
very cliched we're old white people we don't like black people and I thought by,0.67491055
flipping things around and making them envious of them for certain reasons which I can't,0.31089434
spoil I was like yeah that's pretty clever I like that two thumbs up and,0.15993744
I guess when it comes down to I'm just glad there's something slightly original still,0.08315089
left in Hollywood and this movie is a breath of fresh air it blends a,0.06783913
lot of different elements together to give you something unique and something that you haven't,0.097771265
quite seen before but still giving you the things that you want to see in,0.086838886
a film especially a horror film the thriller aspect the suspense with the sad tire,0.11732893
in the comedy it's all these great things blended together to make an entertaining movie,0.103644535
is it perfect no so let's talk about that for the first three forces movie,0.07489722
I was really on the edge of my seat I was buying into the hype,0.04907178
the suspense the build-up I enjoyed the characters in the story and I was really,0.032300614
getting hyped for the climax of the movie and maybe it's because I've seen one,0.11033719
too many movies in my life but just judging by the trailers of this movie,0.06103324
I essentially guessed how the movie would end and it's not like I guess every,0.091118135
single detail of the ending of the film but the general outcome just watching the,0.04576672
trailers I could watch those and be like yeah it's probably going to go this,0.081568606
direction and it does and is that necessarily a bad thing no but I was,0.067858145
just hoping that the movie might have a twist to where you couldn't guess just,0.081336446
watching the trailer like I said the first three fourths of the movie are very,0.06643391
clever I really enjoyed the build up but once you get the payoff to everything,0.09092048
I thought it came across a little bit silly it sort of has this made-for-tv,0.41668102
sci-fi channel vibe going on I thought I got a little bit too convoluted for,0.28697217
its own good and I almost feel like the movie took too much of a,0.060916297
physical approach to the ending of the film I thought if it was more of,0.05197808
a psychological approach with everything being inside of your head I thought that would have,0.36195496
been a little bit more interesting and believable as far as action goes I thought,0.10139493
the main actor who played Chris the main character of the film did a great,0.047313448
job with playing this very subtle down-to-earth guy who is just he felt like a,0.19373018
dude in this weird situation and I couldn't help but think hey if I was,0.14375426
just this guy in this situation that's probably the same kind of things I would,0.088558786
be doing too now my final flicking thoughts of the movie get out at times,0.1052905
this is a funny comedy satire film at other times it's a very creepy thriller,0.2710318
suspense aurifil and the biggest praise I can get this move is it blends all,0.083897434
those different genres together to give you something new and original and it's also entertaining,0.08634122
but as far as the overall writing and directing go I liked it this movie's,0.08170006
self-aware at times I like the Kombi aspect of it but one of my favorite,0.099161945
things about this movie is throughout this movie there's so many little intricate details that,0.057117645
characters and sayings and events that happen that don't make any sense until the final,0.1039813
conclusion of the film and I absolutely love when a movie gives you a payoff,0.09941047
like that to where all these little minor plot details finally add up into something,0.109745674
bigger and this is by far the best horror film I've seen on the theatres,0.1240402
of 2017 yeah so I'm going to give get out and the more I think,0.15110146
