born in all the massive amounts of praise it's been getting recently it has been,0.079776816
blowing up it has been called like one of the best films of all time,0.18771935
I kid you not there have been reviews out there that have been hyping this,0.110795215
movie up to the high heavens and when I went to go see this at,0.059785396
TIFF I wasn't sure if he was gonna live up to all of that hype,0.13347442
I was really nervous that he was gonna let me down a little bit and,0.31089434
just be very standard and after seeing it at if I can't believe I'm saying,0.058785666
this but this is a film that absolutely lives up to the hype this is,0.06533524
an incredible directorial debut from Bradley Cooper and features phenomenal performances not only from Cooper,0.033901174
but Lady gaga as well not to mention it also has one of the best,0.31089434
original soundtracks of the year with some of the catchiest tunes that are gonna be,0.058077104
stuck in your head for days even weeks after you've seen the film hell I'm,0.50622624
still singing them in the shower and I don't even have the soundtrack yet but,0.20110813
aside from all of that the focus really should be on Bradley Cooper because this,0.071889065
is one of the most impressive directorial debuts I have ever seen Cooper feels very,0.05915614
at home in the director's chair crafting a very raw and emotional story that is,0.059224855
going to bring tears to many people's eyes it's very evident that through the time,0.2130872
he spent working with all these a list directors he clearly picked up from them,0.094973385
he was able to implement the knowledge he had attained into this picture the film,0.10665216
is not only very genuine but it's an incredible realistic look at relation chips and,0.048143532
to people who may be in the same profession vying for the spotlight and how,0.092593275
that can affect a relationship but more than that I think what are the most,0.060157105
impressive things about Cooper's direction here is how he decides to shoot it how it's,0.3775202
blocked how these concert sequences really come to life I'm not kidding when I say,0.30704945
that this is some of the best concert cinematography I have ever seen it really,0.06256128
feels as though you are part of the audience in there when Jackson is playing,0.064521946
his Tunes and even from the very beginning when you start hearing the hypnotic kick,0.24248512
of the drum as Jackson enters the stage everything comes alive the sound feels visceral,0.1689222
it sounds like you're at an actual concert and it adds more authenticity to what's,0.09084092
going on and on top of that adds to the rawness and emotions that are,0.078006186
felt especially when the duo is performing together on stage but what I think I,0.08216069
like most about Cooper's direction in the way he stages these sequences is that even,0.059672315
when there's a million other things going on when there's hundreds of adoring fans in,0.04642094
the crowd when there's other people in a room when you have all of this,0.10015453
external noise the focus remains on Jackson and Ally he's able to block out all,0.101552315
of that and have your attention locked on the two artists in some of the,0.15555078
intimate moments that they share while they're on stage that is not an easy task,0.081553474
and I think coming from a first-time director it's even more impressive that Cooper was,0.047251023
able to pull it off as well as he did I think what helps immerse,0.08100097
you even more into the film is when you have such catchy original songs that,0.0878638
also provides some great emotion as well I think by far my favorite sequence in,0.04510108
the film and you see this in the trailer is when Jackson invites Ali on,0.048289444
to the stage for the first time and she belts out this beautiful song that,0.09185201
is probably my favorite in the entire film it's not only a great moment because,0.09885375
of how it's staged but it's the emotion that is going on at that time,0.058087926
and how the song personifies this this is her jump into the spotlight and you,0.3198712
can feel the energy between the two on stage which is infectious I can honestly,0.05066708
say that without the two of them actually performing on stage I don't know if,0.08982429
these sequences would have conveyed as well as they did touch on the emotional aspects,0.07225135
of this story because this is a film that by the time it ends it,0.07899564
has knocked you on your ass it has affected you internally I know I started,0.9480856
tearing up at the very and that's because of how invested you get in this,0.084628776
relationship how invested you get in the characters because in a lot of these scenarios,0.051537577
I feel like we can envision ourselves in the shoes of these characters we love,0.033073906
someone but they're struggling through a lot yet at the same time you're trying to,0.05779266
do what's best for you and your career and some of this emotional baggage may,0.0811915
bleed into your work environment it's this visceral and relatable relationship between Jackson and Ally,0.27875483
that elevate this film to being more than just your typical love story about an,0.108668834
aging star going downwards and an upcoming star going upwards it really is more than,0.060618635
that because the focus of this film and the heart of this film is the,0.059439115
relationship and the thing that sells the film even more so than Cooper's direction our,0.034141243
incredible performances you truthfully are looking at two of the best performances of the year,0.06048051
Lady gaga a first-time actress completely knocked my socks off this is one of the,0.35847673
best acting debuts I have ever seen she had such nuance and poise it felt,0.1296011
like she had been acting for years and it also helps that she stripped down,0.15146442
in such a raw manner that we haven't seen from her before and watching her,0.14935926
transformation into this pop star such a great commentary on artists who are emerging and,0.10800217
blowing up in order to achieve this certain level of fame it seems like Ally,0.31089434
has to sell out a little bit and that struggle between her and Jackson over,0.15507054
that fact I think is a great commentary on how people can change as a,0.07561761
result of Fame and speaking of Cooper we have to touch on Bradley Cooper's performance,0.114983976
next because it's not only the best performance of the film it's probably Cooper's best,0.066677235
performance ever this is an actor who's completely recognizable and when you're watching this film,0.13372298
you're seeing Bradley Cooper's face but you're not seeing Bradley Cooper his performance is completely,0.2676446
transformative he really gets into the voice and mindset of Jackson main and the demons,0.4953461
that he struggles with along the way feel so real that it's surprising that Cooper,0.05731034
himself isn't struggling with these issues not once when I was watching this film did,0.09127827
I look out and see Bradley Cooper I saw Jackson mane and that's a testament,0.10233678
to how of a performance Cooper delivers here because when you look at a guy,0.10583931
like that and you can look at the posters and clearly see Bradley Cooper but,0.036743596
you watch the film and Cooper is nowhere to be seen that means you're giving,0.05846891
probably one of the best performances of the year but aside from Cooper's performance I,0.03497385
just find his character to be the most fascinating the most sympathetic yet you hate,0.2424937
him at certain moments and the struggle he goes through with his substance abuse and,0.13317007
the relationship with Allie I think is both heartbreaking and touching at the same time,0.12774713
I was a mess watching this film by the holy nlgger and that's just a,0.2514273
testament to how great 20:18 a star is born is it affects you in a,0.08629384
way that when you leave the theater you're still thinking about it I know I'm,0.14886951
still thinking about it I'm still humming the tunes I'm still picturing the moments between,0.08425482
the two lovers and it's just something beautiful that doesn't come around that often this,0.1963603
film is sure to get a bunch of accolades come award season Best Picture Best,0.048771955
Actor Best Actress Best Director Best Original Song for crying out loud now whether or,0.07564088
not it wins all those remains to be seen but you can expect a large,0.08088691
number of nominations for a star is born and I can honestly say it is,0.02606594
well deserved and for all those reasons and the reasons I've mentioned throughout my review,0.089952245
I'm ultimately going to be giving a star is born supercharged seriously this is a,0.090735964
film I cannot wait to see again I cannot wait for you all to witness,0.13697584
this on the big screen it's going to amass a huge fan base and people,0.1501596
are really going to be championing this film come award season but anyways I want,0.0737426
