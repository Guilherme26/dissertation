there's nothing that says i love you more than giving your boyfriend an old-fashioned on the beach it's true love in its purest form moonlight released in 2016 and is directed by barry jenkins who has also directed such films like medicine for melancholy and if beale street could talk and this film is starring travante rhodes andre holland janelle monae ashton sanders jerrell jerome naomi harris and mahershala ali moonlight follows a young african-american man who grapples with his identity and sexuality while experiencing the everyday struggles of childhood adolescence and the begrudging adulthood and this film is the recipient of three academy awards including best picture officially best supporting actor and best adapted screenplay which i'm gonna be honest i gotta call [ __ ] on that adapted screenplay thing because this is based on a play that was never published i i believe it the work has to be published in order for it to be adapted and fall under that category so if anything this should have won best original screenplay in my opinion and then films like arrival or fences should have won for best adaptive screenplay that year just my opinion this is also the movie that was part of the big like once in a lifetime controversy at the oscars where the best picture winner was announced as la la land and then for like two minutes it was the best picture until it wasn't and they realized like oh no it's actually moonlight we had the wrong card we read off the wrong card i remember when it happened too and when all of it happened and they said la la land i was super happy because that was my pick for best picture that year but there was i remember having this gut feeling like something was gonna happen or something something like this was gonna happen and then all of a sudden here it was did they ever announce who was fired over that i mean that's that's something that's like okay someone's gonna be fired over this it's nothing against you as a person but this was a humongous mistake someone needs to lose their job over this oh whatever though i'm not going to look it up instead i'm going to talk about this movie which is a beautiful look at a very difficult time in a very difficult subject for a lot of people especially of a younger age now i have my own baggage i am a straight white male so that's the experience that's the privilege that i have so looking at this film that just examines the black experience and especially someone of the black experience coming up confused about their sexual identity i can only pull so much from my own baggage so take that for whatever you will hey it's a white boy talking about moonlight you can find it credible if you want or you can pass over this review it's definitely your prerogative but i'm just laying it out there for you i remember watching this the first time and i was kind of lukewarm on it there were things about the film that i absolutely loved and i thought were perfect they were beautiful they were heart-wrenching and there were some aspects of the film where i was like this what the storytelling device just doesn't really make sense here and watching it a second time for this review i still feel the same way the story structure or the storytelling device that this film implements is this is three different separate chapters in chiron's life the first chapter deals when he was very very young as a kid chapter two deals with when he was a teenager and chapter three deals with when he is an adult which sounds good on paper i think but in execution it just felt like you hit a wall between each chapter in particular the first two chapters this is when shiron is figuring out himself and figuring out where he wants to go with his life and then when the screen pops up he's aged 10 years and i go no no no i was i was liking what was happening with the kid i was liking what was happening with mahershala ali i want to see that connection more so in terms of satisfying the audience in the term of storytelling the plot structure here it doesn't make sense why would you do this it's terrible there's a part of me for like the first like five or ten minutes of the next chapter that's just so angered inside because i was being i was being groomed for what was happening in the one part of his life and i wanted to see it and then nope it happened and now we're over here in this chapter of his life it almost felt a little pretentious like oh yes this is my storytelling device it's so unique to this film come on that's that's not cool but i have a sense that i'm definitely in the minority with that viewpoint on this film because this film is paled by many people by many publications as one of the best films in the last decade do i agree with that sentiment no it's good it's just not one of the best that i've seen sorry well let me talk about the things that i love about this film jerrell jerome who plays the adolescent version of chiron is magnificent oh my god i felt it felt so hard for this kid this poor adolescent teenager who is hiding just this what to himself feels like this dark secret inside he doesn't want to let that out because if he lets that out he's going to be bullied and beaten to an inch of his life and just the obvious depression and sadness just with his facial reactions alone he doesn't have that many lines and it makes sense because he's a quiet teenager he is struggling with his sexuality and how that has implications on the culture that he is in there have been articles and there have been interviews of the directors saying that the the black culture the black adolescent culture when you are a man you're supposed to promote masculinity and to do that you need to promote toughness and you need to show up your muscles and show aggression that makes you manly that makes you tough and to some degree that's kind of how my adolescence was too if you had any feminine or homosexual tendencies as a young boy as a teenager you were made fun of and picked on it definitely happened to me a few times growing up and it happened to a couple other people in my school growing up as well needs to say i connected with this character so much and i felt so bad for him he barely has any lines he just he tells the emotion he tells the story with his physicality and with his facial expressions this actor is exceptional i want to see him go on to do many other things he he was great here and heck even when we get to young chiron this little kid has the same tendencies he's seen as an outcast and he's constantly bullied on by kids at school and i'll be honest the first time that i watch this movie i didn't watch any trailers i didn't read anything about it i just watched it and it took me a while to realize like oh no this is about a kid who's discovering their sexuality for the very first time and asking themselves questions am i gay am i straight what what do i find attractive how would i know what i find attractive and that's where mahershala ali's character comes in one hershali of course won the best supporting actor in this role and he absolutely deserved it but it's annoying because he's barely in this movie he's only in the first chapter you have such a great supporting character i wanted to see where that relationship was going and then we go to chapter two and he is oh again that's the storytelling here and i hate it because it leaves the characters to tell us about things that happen or maybe ambiguously tell us things that may have happened to certain characters that we don't see again anymore i hate it i hate the storytelling here i can't get over it i love the child actor mahershan ali is fantastic in his role as one janelle monae who plays his wife is a stellar actor i've loved everything that i've seen her in and she's such a kind-hearted warm spirited character that i i want to reach through the screen and give her a hug and say thank you for helping this kid out because this kid is being bullied he is such a what seems to be a terrible life thank you for helping him and then we get to naomi harris's character who plays chiron's mother and she plays a character that you just love to hate i hate this mother so much she's one of the worst mothers in all of cinema putting my foot down on that and kudos goes to naomi harris she is a brilliant actress and she does an amazing job here what she does and the way she portrays this drug addict of a mother who doesn't give two shits about her kid just is looking for that next score to make herself feel good the way she portrays her is so brilliantly done it was such a tight race with her and viola davis for best supporting actress that year at the academy awards i would have given it to viola davis too but god damn it naomi harris is a close second it's a character that you just love to hate there's nothing redeeming about her at all and she tries to make her son and sequentially the audience feel bad for her in the final chapter when you see that she's in rehab and she's trying to make herself better and have a better life you just see what she did to shyron in the first two chapters that you go no you don't deserve forgiveness you were a terrible mother no mother should ever do that to a child i just hated her so much she was that damn good so good where i think this film falls short other than the storytelling device is our final two lead actors in the final chapter of chiron's life andre holland and trevontae rhodes they play the adult versions of the adolescent versions of their characters and when they were teenagers they did have a kind of hidden sexual relationship and here they are as adults and they're trying to rekindle that spark because they hadn't seen each other in almost 10 years and personally i felt no sexual or romantic tension between the two in particular on chiron's part this this kid your former friend from high school he's the only one that's ever touched you or lit that flame in you in a sexual or desired manner and here you are as an adult you are on your own fruition and you're seeing him for the very first time i do not feel any type of sexual or romantic tension between you and kevin i just don't as an audience member it's absent for me needless to say i think this film is it's a good two-thirds of a film but then when we get to that final chapter just kind of halts and all the energy at least that was supposed to be happening throughout the entire movie i think we just come to an abrupt wall we never keep going after that the cinematography here is beautiful the use of colors the use of water throughout chiron's entire life is exceptional i love the little details and the layers upon layers that everything that you see in each shot is telling you as an audience member but again the final chapter and the way that the story is told it just why would you ever do that as a storyteller you stop the energy you stop the pacing abruptly and it takes a while to get that going again and then when you get it going again all of a sudden we're stopping and we're fast forwarding another 10 years in this kid's life i don't want to do that i want to see the transition i want to see the progression of this character as opposed to being told hey here he is and hey here he is again here he is again as an adult there you go give me the oscar again there are great things about this film but there are also things that i i hate about this movie and i know i'm in the minority with that but this is my personal opinion this is my channel this is my review if you disagree that's totally fine actually i welcome you to tell me why you disagree with me if you do i'm gonna give moonlight three out of five blu-rays not exactly what i had in mind but not bad all right guys now comes my favorite part of my videos where i pick which movie i'm gonna be watching next the next one comes as a screener that i received through gingernutsuphore.com a great website where you can go to see reviews and talks about everything that is horror video games films tv shows anything horror head over there if you want to check them out it's really really cool website you got a lot of great people on there but they gave me the screener for a film called anti-life and it looks like bruce willis is here and i'm fairly certain that this is like a direct dvd movie for bruce willis which is what he's been loving to do in the last decade because it's a nice little steady income for him but we'll see if he
