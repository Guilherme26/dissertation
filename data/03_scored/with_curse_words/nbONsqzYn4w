welcome I hope you like what you hear we're gonna be talking about a fun,0.09281353
comedy today called book smart it's the directorial debut of Olivia Wilde two stars Kaitlyn,0.15272553
Dever and beanie Feldstein the story follows two high school friends that have spent the,0.0424879
last four years relentlessly hitting the books while others were going to parties and seemingly,0.18315826
working much less than they were in realizing that they could have potentially missed out,0.08047906
on some of the fun that their peers have been having over the last four,0.09126054
years the two of them tried to catch up on all of it by having,0.11155849
one wild and memorable night of partying on the eve of their graduation no I'm,0.15122415
not gonna lie to you from what the trailer showed me of this one I've,0.17664702
appeared to be another rather formulaic high school comedy with some strong emotional undertones to,0.11106971
it it did look like it has some potential though because the trailers made me,0.091022424
laugh and despite being many many years out of high school I was actually interested,0.08327242
in what this cast could deliver and much more so what Olivia Wilde could pull,0.10100928
off from behind the camera and I think much to my delight this film delivered,0.08580657
much more than a simple teenage story of growth into the adult world that was,0.07863373
a heartwarming coming-of-age story but it also just blended in a charming sense of humor,0.076394595
with everything with some sincere emotional arcs and a great musical score that routinely was,0.031069577
able to pump a lot of energy into the atmosphere of the narrative on top,0.08857042
of all that it was a successful female buddy comedy that I thought thrived from,0.18944463
the performances of devaron Feldstein the script was extremely well written but it was the,0.06409342
delivery of the material and the chemistry between these actresses that I thought created genuine,0.09068105
characters I felt were just impossible not to connect with they captured that pure friendship,0.08803613
with ease and it resulted in some effective laughs that had me thinking back to,0.081694104
my high school days I was able to just really see myself inside of these,0.11447309
characters within a few minutes of their screen time their routine and going to school,0.07758417
was much different than my best friend and what we had the music may have,0.02307479
been different as well but the dynamic we had it was very much our own,0.050183836
like it was for these two girls and it had me completely invested in just,0.119539976
the authenticity of everything the script weaves solid arcs for both characters individually but it,0.034304056
also showed a strong focus on the growth of their friendship overall which is this,0.06799364
what really had me completely engaged in where this story is gonna take not only,0.08603251
them but their friendship I mean this film honestly does have a collection of scenes,0.1539301
that felt very familiar to a lot of other movies in the genre yet I,0.030725116
have to say with devaron Feldstein creating such extremely likeable characters it was still very,0.08943055
much intriguing to see them progress through these scenes regardless I think the writing was,0.098071545
really able to just hit all the emotional beats with near perfect timing when it,0.19998118
needed to be lighting comical about the situations and the dialogue delivered and when it,0.042286977
needed to be serious and more dramatic the turn felt very natural and smooth as,0.13245341
the story arcs in the various character and relationship dynamics took over and everything complemented,0.020037675
each other very well I thought it was also able to feel very comfortable and,0.079339735
capable in a realistically crass high school setting without ever losing its sincerity there certainly,0.15440762
are some crude situations and some jokes that earn this movie it's our rating however,0.04801275
they never felt placed in to simply be raunchy for Raji's sake I mean things,0.118621096
are gonna get vulgar and stories centering around teenagers because at that age we often,0.15503223
were I mean unless I went to the wrong high school sex parties drugs and,0.60454935
alcohol are all things that many teenagers are exposed to and this story really captured,0.03564868
those elements with that realistic approach that kept it from just simply feeling like shock,0.097690545
value humor it really complimented that comedic tone by exploring other social elements that teenagers,0.10468305
must go through which gave everything much more heart I think Olivia Wilde's direction was,0.12426737
skillful in her debut it's clear to me that she understood the tone and the,0.12996152
intention of this story about she did a great job of manoeuvring the characters to,0.0941171
capture the right emotion and level of intensity during many different scenes I really thought,0.06443862
she let the performances shine by just holding the frame of the shop or longer,0.10584941
periods during the more emotionally driven scenes and then as the night progresses in the,0.06828357
level of craziness elevates I think Wilde really infused it with a vibrant and crisp,0.36317715
artistic style and overall what she did was subtle but she accomplished things behind the,0.11335994
lens that just blended smoothly with the tone of the story when the narrative was,0.038476273
calm camera techniques felt much more simplistic and then as drugs and alcohol and action,0.24310969
makes its way in the story I thought wild was really able to switch up,0.063831314
the techniques and the angles to just show a skillful eye in creating her vision,0.08554264
for this story another strong positive for me with this one was the supporting cast,0.06047162
I thought there were a variety of side characters throughout the storylines who just continually,0.045670334
keep things feeling fresh in terms of personality types and angles of humor and jason,0.10165205
sudeikis lisa kudrow and Will Forte all provide some charm in small doses with a,0.15077554
collection of younger characters as well like Skylar ghazan doe Billie lourd and Noah Gavin,0.14053288
all bringing some life to some otherwise routine character types that I thought were all,0.10178098
able at different times to provide some laughs everything in this movie to me just,0.1157584
felt right nothing really took over the focus of being on these two friends and,0.06144646
all the other elements felt like just perfect side dishes to everything it's very heartwarming,0.07099902
without feeling sappy and it's because nothing just felt overly forced so overall I really,0.18106344
enjoyed this movie and I'm surprisingly enough gonna have to give book-smart 90% on the,0.11790573
entertainment meter drawbacks in this movie would be minor like I said I haven't been,0.08288149
to high school in a long time so I couldn't tell you how realistic or,0.14901997
unrealistic some of the character types in this movie were but for the needs of,0.053528458
the story I thought they all worked for providing a variety of different personalities I,0.036119625
mean the movie does follow some genre tropes the progression of the plotline is one,0.058154322
that you can sort of forecast and some of the humor does not hit with,0.06268364
the intended impact but I don't think any comedy is gonna go out there and,0.1022588
deliver a perfect string of laughs so in this instance I think much much more,0.19136775
of the humor work than what didn't so when all that was paired with the,0.04305419
more dramatic elements of the story the result was honestly just an endearing coming-of-age movie,0.10353372
with two lead characters that felt very genuine and down-to-earth that can make this genre,0.04304989
film appeal to a mass audience thank you guys so much for watching this video,0.09286884
