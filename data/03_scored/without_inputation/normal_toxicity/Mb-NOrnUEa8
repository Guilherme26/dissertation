the Irishman is directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Robert DeNiro Joe Pesci and Al Pacino and follows the life of Frank Sheeran a truck driver who may or may not have had some involvement with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa,0.07822758
I was really excited for this movie purely and simply because it is directed by Martin Scorsese,0.080762364
now I don't have to explain myself on that one because the guy is a genius when it comes to filmmaking and throughout his entire career,0.15531543
he's never made at least in my personal opinion,0.22203985
he is yet to make a single bad film,0.36353165
every movie,0.07963364
he's made has been good if not great and the best thing about his career is that even though some of his movies may be structurally or stylistically a little bit similar every movie he makes is pretty much completely different from the last for example Hugo is completely different to silence the wolf of Wall Street is completely different to Goodfellas,0.14220275
and the Irishman is another one of those movies in his career,0.090469934
it feels very familiar yet has enough different things going on that it kind of stands as its own unique thing,0.04772978
that he is yet to pull off in his career,0.16100393
and I've got to say the Irishman is yet another great film to add to his filmography because I enjoyed every single minute of this movie and that's saying something especially considering how long dismay V is but I'll get onto that in a little bit first up,0.0927103
I have to talk about the performances everyone in this movie brings their a game and that's saying something considering you have pretty much,0.06183365
a shitload of a-listers in this film you've got Robert De Niro playing Frank Sheeran,0.7423299
and he's really really good in this movie he does a lot he conveys a lot of emotion in this movie just through his facial expression or the way he looks because usually nowadays in film you're used to someone kind of telling you how they feel whereas in this movie there's a lot of just distant or blank expressions that are left open for interpretation,0.090052396
in terms of how he is feeling,0.068113394
and there are a lotta scenes where you're just solely relying on the look that Robert De Niro is giving on his face to pretty much explain how he is feeling in said scenes,0.14707191
and I think it works really well here that,0.05198425
and also the fact that any scene that he is in with Joe Pesci who plays Russell is absolutely brilliant,0.097827
and it's really nice to see Joe Pesci in a movie like this again because he is / as far as I'm aware he came out of retirement just to be in this,0.099700525
movie and I haven't seen him in a film since well Homeline - all the good,0.062011383
old Goodfellas and it's really nice to see him doing what he does best again because I've kind of missed him being,0.11269242
in films but no Joe Pesci brings his a-game to this film and he really is so good in this movie that he's one of those characters where if you're on his good side you he's a really,0.14024176
likable character but then if you get just ever so slightly on his,0.1216882
bad side,0.16841146
he could completely your life up and that switch between the two is really noticeable in this movie,0.10532198
and I loved everything,0.057397906
he did with that performance,0.07495994
Al Pacino is also really great in this movie as he plays Jimmy Hoffa,0.06869668
and I thought he was fantastic in almost every single scene he was in and I'm quite surprised to find out that this is his first collaboration with Scorsese you would think over the many years both of them have been working you would have thought at some point,0.07844273
they would have worked together,0.06918724
but apparently this is the first time they have worked on a project together and it shows because they really do work so well together when put in the right project and Al Pacino makes every moment last in this film,0.06449466
especially the moments where he's able to kind of go full-on and really over exaggerate certain things and just go really over-the-top in his performance and I love it when he does that in movies if you've seen heat you'll know exactly what I'm on about she got great ass and you got your hair all the way up,0.7700217
but yeah he was fantastic in this movie and also a lot of the supporting cast were great as well,0.08686837
and as an avid follower of Martin Scorsese's projects throughout the years,0.06878127
it's really nice to see a lot of actors from his TV,0.10998202
oriented projects such as Broadwalk Empire or vinyl,0.09961361
it's nice to see a lot of those actors crop up in this movie such as Ray Romano Bobby Cannavale and of course Steven Graham Steven Graham is one of the most underrated actors working today I'm just saying every performance I see of him is like better than the last one I'm not saying something considering that every performance,0.10823837
he gives is absolutely fantastic,0.11767606
but yeah he really does deliver in this movie and everyone delivers,0.11267707
I suppose my only nitpick when it comes to performances or screen time in that sense is the Anna Paquin who plays an older version of Robert Nero's daughter doesn't get that much screen time and I wouldn't really care that much if it wasn't such an integral arc in the emotional personality of Robert De Niro's character is such an important emotional arc for his character,0.057629462
yet you don't really see much of her character therefore that arc kind of feels a little bit a little bit empty in my opinion,0.35137954
I do think the point of it is conveyed by the end of the film but I just would have liked one or two more scenes with her character just to fully to make that arc fully realized in its best form,0.03511998
oh and in regards to the de-aging stuff that they do for the actors,0.08867449
yeah it's a little bit noticeable at first,0.15270036
but after a couple of things you just kind of get used to it and it's actually really bloody impressive,0.4517569
there's a lot of shots where Joe Pesci looks like a young Joe Pesci or De Niro looks like really De Niro,0.2399676
and it's just really impressive especially with some of the scenes and how they play out,0.06288041
and how technically intricate they are especially in regards to how well they're shot,0.16066569
the fact that they're able to make that D aging thing look as convincing as it is amongst,0.07686641
these intricate looking like long takes is really impressive,0.07842484
now,0.03121897
the one thing that people are talking about the most about this movie is the runtime is three and a half hours long and yes that can seem very daunting at first but I've got to be honest even though there are times in the film where you can kind of feel that three hour runtime kick in I was thoroughly fascinated and engaged throughout the entire thing and that's also even more saying something considering that a lot of the movie is just people talking,0.10289565
yes,0.036876976
you do have scenes of violence,0.54900974
and you know some really tense scenes especially towards the end,0.087556526
but the majority of the movie is just people sitting down and talking to each other or just a lot of montages explaining how certain things got from point A to point B and it's pretty much Scorsese doing what he did in Goodfellas but a lot more refined and restrained to the point where it feels more polished than Goodfellas in a sense if you've seen the movie you kind of know I mean but it kind of feels a lot more you know focused and restrained than Goodfellas water was,0.09189472
and I really did appreciate that about this movie which kept me engaged throughout,0.07250814
it's three and a half hour long runtime also is entertaining as the Mafia related stuff is in this movie I actually found one of the more interesting and more powerful moments to come actually right,0.09783255
at the end of the movie when you see Frank as an old man,0.22226375
I don't say anything else,0.087175824
if you haven't seen the film but I just thought it really really worked for me and the emotional resonance of that scene specifically the one of the last shots of the film really hits home and kind of ends up delivering a completely different theme and message then maybe what was conveyed at the start of the movie because at the start of the film you kind of think okay,0.06342485
I'm kind of going into my regular,0.20009117
Scorsese cliches here,0.11009073
but then by the end of the film school says he delivers you a completely new message and it really does hit,0.090547495
if you know exactly what you're looking for in the end,0.071187444
the Irishman is a thoroughly entertaining movie that can feel a tad slow at times,0.15472355
but never completely drags the movie down because of it but no it is a thoroughly entertaining movie with fantastic performances,0.07470189
I suppose if I had to nitpick in the movie I would say that the passage of time in certain bits towards the start of the film is a little unclear because you're kind it will kind of cut from one scene to another and you're not sure whether you're still in the same time period or whether they've jumped forwards or backwards in time it gets a little bit clearer the more the movie goes on to come because it kind of sticks in a certain time period of Frank's life for a long period of time and then will then cut to the next and then cut to the next but in those first few scenes it's a little bit unclear because it just bounces back and forth all the time and you're a little bit unsure how old he's supposed to be or how far or how early in these people's lives,0.15733044
we are currently in because there's no indication of it,0.050062213
and it just kind of feels a little unclear at first but like I said it does get a lot clearer,0.07553796
the more the movie goes on and apart from that though I will happily give the Irishman an 8.5 out of 10,0.11007339
this is definitely proof that Scorsese still knows what he's doing and he's just a master of his craft at this point,0.11986873
he's yet to make a bad movie and the Irishman is proof that he can still make fantastic films so guys that was my review for the Irishman,0.2751747
I hope you enjoyed it,0.18590634
