so the modern horror genre actually kicked off with medical living-dead which featured a black,0.37472665
lead but then the genre quickly switched to white female leads so I find it,0.37765843
absolutely fascinating that Jordan Peele has taken inspiration from some of those female centric horror,0.47886112
films that comment on misogyny I mean I guess in some degree they all kind,0.24187946
of comment on misogyny but still you know Rosemary's Baby The Stepford Wives they took,0.2103948
it to the next level and Peele has said that those were direct inspirations for,0.07158352
making get out so he built on those took the horror genre full circle with,0.14978619
a commentary on race relations it's pretty impressive like like is the thesis statement you're,0.21280335
just blown away as that you can see where all the critics all the media,0.19475378
rocking a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes it was really well positioned to go into,0.15350205
the weekend but like many thesis statements while it's easy to wow well not easy,0.0476631
but it's easier to Wow right out of the gate it's harder to bring it,0.06998545
on home you know that pesky third act and I think that's what really trips,0.11128348
peel up I think that it's weak and doesn't work and holds back the film,0.11141969
from being a classic on the level of Rosemary's Baby or Stepford Wives but still,0.11042267
overall very positive development for the horror genre how different ethnicities are represented in film,0.15744638
and everyone involved with this production so on that note oh we just said that,0.07763551
I am absolutely thrilled for peel and its cast their talent is being recognized not,0.08596014
just by you know black audiences but this movie has crossover appeal my theatre when,0.31089434
I went on Saturday night I was traveling in Los Angeles for the Oscars Dolby,0.043062493
flew me out there to go behind the scenes that's why I'm late reviewing this,0.109461315
but my theatre was 5050 in terms of the demographics that attended and that's reflected,0.037040606
actually in polling for the film it was it because you're taking also Asian viewers,0.15415138
and Latino viewers in to account it was about like mid-30s for both african-american and,0.17175934
Caucasian audiences so that's spectacular especially because you're talking about a film with a black,0.4462721
unknown lead you know it's not Denzel it's not Will Smith and also a first-time,0.057662882
director in the genre who also happens to be black to have that kind of,0.11505629
crossover appeal it's been very difficult in Hollywood to achieve that so that right there,0.077422045
you know is something that Peele can be proud of and he has definitely has,0.046831533
something to say I think the intellectual approach helped him and you also clearly loves,0.081596196
the genre but everybody was listening and that's just so spectacular and I think that,0.05480073
well again this won't become a horror classic and we'll discuss the ending at the,0.12550345
end of this review in the spoiler section but I think this will serve as,0.07457707
a launchpad particularly for Peale and his star Daniel kuya I want to make sure,0.16424175
I pronounce his name correctly now I want to start off with Pele as a,0.22445205
director he's been stuck in Keith's shadow for quite some time I felt bad for,0.15715617
him but I do think the key is the superior on-camera talent there's just there's,0.120725356
an energy there but the seat pealed breakout a Keith shadow by going behind the,0.056024462
camera I think it just shows you how important is to be able to think,0.1025498
outside the box and a willingness to adjust your dream you know I still in,0.064492576
the same industry still doing what he loves and he has now had a resounding,0.08673537
success and I think that while he lets himself as a rope down as a,0.35241055
writer at the end of the movie and quite frankly if he had a better,0.100161046
producer sorry Jason Blum the producer would have you know pointed this out to him,0.08917408
and it's amazing fix the end would have been a very easy fix which makes,0.08141313
it all the more frustrating but his skills as a director are very impressive from,0.13631453
the very first scene this camerawork to his use of music to his ability to,0.08936578
make a movie that was made for under five million dollars look like it was,0.071812004
made for six time that six times that proves the appeal is a very talented,0.07845237
director he also makes some really unique creative choices throughout the film which elevate it,0.023008063
and I would say he's the most ambitious director that Jason Blum has discovered you,0.09197668
know a new director since James Wan and Scott Derrickson and that's not bad company,0.1092308
to be it I'd be very curious to see what Pele does next when you,0.091127925
know what his next gig is if he stays in his own lane or if,0.063566886
he swallowed up by a franchise also to be fair key & peele sketches role,0.14363247
is very ambitious ly directed so even more kudos to peel for obviously paying attention,0.12725057
and learning on the job I would also say the peel is up there with,0.050914966
Kenya bears from blackish on ABC as a voice that presents black characters as fully,0.046571
three-dimensional characters and not stereotypes caricatures or having the burden of representing their entire community,0.06307576
also credit belongs to Daniel Kuya the star of the film who gives a wonderfully,0.032998282
understated performance and you know with an American accent no less he's from the UK,0.17076336
he got his big start on Black Mirror over there that show came here to,0.10043536
Netflix but you know some of his best moments came with just a look he's,0.06370764
a really talented actor I think his body language is excellent and just even just,0.15055525
what he can say with his eyes speaking of that Pele does do some good,0.14103228
writing with the tragic backstory to begin Scalia's character and I thought that kahl√∫a did,0.05915266
a fabulous job bringing that guilt and grief to life you know like Pele set,0.13964385
him up but kouya knocked it out of the park I also want to give,0.14829297
a shout out specifically to Betty Gabriel she said she stood out to me in,0.22032
the purge election year last year but to see her here playing such a different,0.12142407
character shows what amazing range she has and I hope she gets more work as,0.0584812
well the whole film is very well cast though and no often they say good,0.07270012
directing a lot of it is just good casting right like if you know and,0.08540866
that's you know people talk about us Tarantino right like if you can't if you,0.1797832
cast well 90% of your work is done and Pele I think this is an,0.09438992
excellent example of that for instance he did a very good job using the personas,0.06936346
that Allison Williams and Catherine Keener have already established through their other work and that,0.05085599
was that made both of them very effective here I also thought you know there,0.070332274
was some comedic relief from the best friend although here the best friend and the,0.031113764
lead both happened to be played by black actors and that's very progressive in Hall,0.37105876
unfortunately but larell Howry was the funny best friend and he did a great job,0.11517126
I also he was huge just enough you know to lighten the mood just when,0.05808777
it was needed but not too cheap in the film and also that dog quite,0.173554
a ball now for the ending so we're going into spoiler territory so this is,0.11014847
a warning and if you're going to bail out here if you haven't seen the,0.14112793
movie and I would like just to say that get out is worth seeing now,0.14995617
should you see it in the theater while if you're a horror fan or a,0.30529818
cinephile or you're interested in the evolution of how different ethnicities are portrayed in Hollywood,0.394208
or you just like to be part of big events in this film has definitely,0.07351566
become like a moment in pop culture and you should totally see it in the,0.11084906
theater but if none of those things matter to you then you can wait to,0.07952678
stream it all right so last warning we're going to talk about the ending okay,0.17943043
alright so as I said the ending was weak and could have been easily fixed,0.14158383
so a good twist is one where once you know it you can look back,0.06573617
at the earlier part of the film and see the clues just ask em nice,0.019953301
Xiaolan which is you know career-defining twist the sixth sense and interestingly enough he's also,0.10424563
been working with jason blum recently but when you saw this when you'll learn the,0.07144006
twist in the sixth sense and you look back at the rest of the movie,0.09292547
suddenly saw things with new perspectives they made sense etc but here when it was,0.043571103
revealed that Walter and Georgina were actually the armitage grandparents you couldn't look back at,0.075379856
the earlier part of the movie and be like oh yeah that's who they were,0.078355215
acting like grandparents they were the servants of the house the whole time or they,0.085941106
were like not there that was awful weird like as grandpa Armitage was the leader,0.19287744
of this entire movement why would he be satisfied going from that to this chopping,0.1492507
wood and you know you know not really being a part of his family anymore,0.117700666
right they had a late night running which I guess was kind of a nod,0.13822475
to his racing past and I thought that was interesting that he was beaten out,0.08266199
by Jesse Owens to go to the Olympics and that started this whole train of,0.08629267
thought but what was he racing for to what end you know the people who,0.055406414
underwent this procedure never left the community they never did anything with their new bodies,0.11626715
so I don't understand the selling point of oh we're going to take a white,0.5555351
brain and put it in a black body and the thinking here from this evil,0.53490317
group was that both were the superior the white mine in the black body and,0.11315494
create an ultimate individual but I've never saw a shred of the original person inside,0.24250808
there like you saw the the the tragic black soul you know struggling to get,0.32578143
out but I never saw the white person that had been inserted in there I,0.5876557
never saw that person you know it was always just like some unreal zombie like,0.40335375
mode that they went into I didn't I would have been much more interesting like,0.03856895
for instance that guy was kidnapped at the beginning of the movie and when he,0.11752903
showed up at the party he I've had quirks and interests and genuinely acted like,0.08770263
the guy you know that woman's original husband but no it was just he was,0.15513322
like a zombie and so I can't look back at any mom in the movie,0.45138544
and be like I see it in a whole new light you know instead I,0.06695743
go well now it doesn't make sense now you cut them well what about Walters,0.23056297
comments about Rose when he says all she's such an attractive young woman to me,0.18367128
I felt and still feel that that was attributable to his black man's romances rose,0.3293011
but he still you know I mean obviously if you could see from in the,0.080037944
movie that was a great moment when he shot her but you know there you,0.4525975
know I think maybe he you know I thought maybe he was saying it like,0.066701345
what it was spite like she was so beautiful and she lured me to my,0.40312454
doom and I did like that twist I did like that Rose was a honey,0.24168798
trap and I thought it was very funny when she was looking up top and,0.13232353
c-double-a candidates at the end of the movie although again why bother you know if,0.09697125
they weren't going to do anything with these bodies it made no sense you know,0.15194267
the whole superior genetic argument like oh you'd be a great fighter you know if,0.1873406
the brother was saying to Daniel who use character at the dinner table but they,0.053717986
never did anything like that so you I would think they would just be getting,0.26975018
younger bodies you know who cares about the ethnicity look for people who wouldn't be,0.272294
missed and that would make more sense to me in this in the way it,0.0586647
was set up by you know Pele and since it's his script he could set,0.10414573
it up any way he wants so if PL effects this problem and then you,0.14985853
could see that the souls of the people who've taken over the bodies as well,0.16463676
I think this would be a horror classic that would last you know stand the,0.17985696
test of time but instead it's not going to however he was so close to,0.05746601
a horror classic I'm confident that appeal will get there very soon and we'll be,0.10677319
seeing a lot more of Kuya and you know maybe it'll even give a boost,0.10317069
to some of the other people involved in the film I hope Buddy Gabriel but,0.046921242
maybe even Allison Williams might see some some reward for this as well so what,0.06312214
do you think what do you think of the whole movie what did you think,0.088881254
of a twist what do you think of the twist now that I've brought up,0.075615756
my problems with it and what do you think of Peele going forward and also,0.0931236
what he's done for the horror genre and his commentary as well I thought clearly,0.17707458
a very intelligent film it just didn't stick the landing okay write your thoughts down,0.16378744
