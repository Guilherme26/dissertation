and while there may seem to be a lot of them,0.087417416
it's really hard to find a good one that really stands out from the pack too often they turn to these teen soap movies with cheesy dialogue and generic characters you won't find that though here in a book smart sirs beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever as Molly and Amy two high school seniors who have spent their whole high school stuck in the books really trying to prepare them academically,0.09951705
but on this final day of school,0.10283021
they decided to go to a big party to show and prove that they are both smart and fun it also shares Mason Gooding and Skylar Kazan Doe,0.0647489
so this marks Olivia Wilde's directorial debut and she only has the voice and vision to make book-smart a relatable and realistic teen story it was written by Emily Halpern and Sara Hoskins Susanna fobel and Katy Silberman and it really reminded me of Dazed and Confused and Lady Bird with its wholly original characters they've written fantastic banter with Molly and Amy really creating the rapport the inside jokes and the references that feel authentic for these two strong-willed feminist characters with big personalities beanie Feldstein and kaitlyn dever have fantastic chemistry together there's no question the friendship throughout the movie and the supporting cast is just as strong with Billie lourd as the wild and crazy classmate who continuously pops up when you least expect it,0.20185706
and then you have Jason Sudeikis Will Forte and Lisa Cujo are all memorable as the adults in the movie,0.07195317
so like any,0.066104636
good teen movie it's filled with fantastic music,0.084705666
and the soundtrack has the likes of Liz o anis Alanis Morissette themed karaoke scene it's a very deliberate soundtrack as the musical really drives whole scenes and then smaller moments,0.06530167
but then the antithesis is also true as Olivia,0.15440468
Wilde knows that the silence is the key to some of the film's more emotional moments,0.08950162
book-smart is that reminder of the masks that we all wore in high school trying to fit in and trying to create that image that we wanted to others to see in us the beauty in this movie is when we see those masks come off the vulnerability come through with both Amy and Molly as a director it's clear that Olivia Wilde knew the movie that she wanted to make while allowing her cast to really play with these characters to make them as authentic as possible,0.12678008
I'm really excited to see what other stores she has to tell with her next movies I'm giving a book a smart four out of five ticket stubs,0.13008755
