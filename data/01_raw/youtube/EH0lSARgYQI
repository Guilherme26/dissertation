[Music] what does the flick fans and welcome back to my channel I just watched the brand new Spike Lee directed movie black clansmen a movie I've been looking forward to for a long time if you guys don't know how my reviews work I like to talk about the good the bad and then give you my score and I have reviewed a bunch of movies over the last three days they're mag crazy rich Asians and the package please go check those out but right now we're talking about this movie let's get into it and keep this review shorter than usual so black clansmen let's start with the cast because this cast is so dynamic and good and Denzel Washington's son give such a great performance something I never knew could come from well not the family in general because we know Denzel but his son just does such a good job in his chemistry with Adam driver every time the guy pops up in a movie I get excited to see it and he's one of the reasons that this thing drew me in so much he was great their dynamics were great the relationships that most of the characters had were really good and somebody else who surprised me Topher Grace really good and the guy who was from I Tania last year I can't remember his name but oh my goodness he comes out of nowhere and his character was hilarious he gave a good performance now I definitely need to hit on this a lot of people are going to see this movie as heavy-handed whether you agree or disagree with a message there is definitely a message there and it's definitely coming across on the screen but going into this movie seeing the trailer you kind of know that that's coming you can see the social cues in there and if you walk in end up getting really offended at it and not like the movie for those reasons I think you're missing other points of the film because yes some people will not like the message not necessarily the message because I think if you're human you should like the message that we should all love each other and be together I just think that's the truth but maybe spike directs that message towards certain people who are watching this movie and I'm not necessarily a big fan of that fact because I don't like when you're calling people out let's keep the film in focus but I like what they did with the message and I think the ending some people aren't going to be on board for it and while I think it was a little bit too heavy and it it didn't go to the point to where it offended me and I like the fact that that was in there because I think we all need that as human beings right now let's move away from that right now and talk about how good the movie was the filmmaking here was brilliant I think it might be Spike Lee's maybe his best movie in a long long time it's not necessarily my favorite because movies like Malcolm X they're just so good but this movie is up there I will say it's 100% his best in a few years the way that he interject humor into this story yet keeping it serious I always talk about tone and how in a lot of movies it's very inconsistent but here even though the tones tend to shift it does it in a way that flows so good and it doesn't mess up the pacing of the movie the pacing here is oh my gosh I love it there's one point where the film slows down other than that I was engaged from beginning to end I had to use the bathroom really bad and I always know how to test a movie if I have to use the bathroom and I don't want to leave I'm locked in and having a good time and I'm emotionally connected and I didn't really want to leave even though I had to hurry what a pee to myself I didn't really notice any technical aspects that I didn't like I thought the Senate ography was good I liked the shot selection the compositions the color everything about it was just cool to look at now it starts off there were a few here and there that kind of bothered me but overall I thought it looked good it sounded good I liked a story I liked the plot I like to wear it when I'm not going to spoil anything about that but there's some pretty high tension when people start to figure certain things out and by the end of the story you're really rooting for these characters in terms of negatives like I said it did slow down in parts there's one scene towards the end all I will say is initiation that scene lasted a little too long for me it cut back and forth and back and forth between the blacks and the whites and I'm just like ok they didn't cut the fat a little bit because I think this is going on a bit too long I think the movie could have been like 140 135 as opposed to pushing two hours but you know what that's just a minor complaint well there were some shots in there especially at the beginning of just like landscapes a couple that were thrown in and I was like all right I'm not really feeling these shots in particular let's get back to the story and what's kind of serving the purpose here and yes I did say a bit heavy-handed towards the end I'm not saying it was in your face because I don't like what movies do that it usually takes it down a couple notches what I feel about the heavy-handedness is not going to take this movie down and whether I agree or disagree that doesn't matter I just don't like when you call people out that exist today in real life some people are going to dig that and whether you're for him or anti him that doesn't matter when it comes to reviewing this movie if it was anyone unless you know like Hitler some even call him out as much as you want but I just don't like what movies do with that whether it's democratic or republican that always strikes me and rubs me the wrong way and as we get into my score none of those negatives really took the movie that far down it is definitely one of the better films I have seen this year and I was so emotionally hooked and it's weird because these usually aren't the movies that I kind of latch on to but this one in particular I thought was super well done and I really enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would I'm going to get black Klansmen and 87 percent this was a cool film it's got a good groove a good job good pacing everything about it is just straight-up cool and I think if you go and watch it you will get something out of it if not really enjoyed thank you guys so much for watching this video you know my channel for more stuff like a QA and a special
