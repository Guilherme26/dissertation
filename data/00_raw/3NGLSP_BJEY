you know it's nice to see a movie that brings us out of that January feeling that Oscar season it's still going okay so Selma Selma is a movie that chronicles the events of dr. Martin Luther King jr. how he worked the civil rights movement you know the nonviolent acts he adopted from Gandhi so he can help give African Americans rights such as the right to vote I felt like a history teacher saying that felt badass I don't know why did I have like no coat on and that's the whole point of the movie so MLK and his followers can get desegregated from southern law of Selma so they can vote now going into this movie I thought it was just gonna base it off Martin Luther King Jr's life and the struggles he had a face although I did show the second part it didn't really show a whole lot of his life there's usually movies such as Jay Edgar do that and usually turns into quite a mess he actually sets you up right from the get-go and it focuses on the much bigger picture with a great amount of focus Selma was actually a pretty damn good movie the acting in this movie was just phenomenal David oh yeah I had lo Lloyd Lloyd I can't pronounce his name his portrayal of Martin Luther King was extremely spot-on for some scenes I thought I was actually watching Martin Luther King jr. he got so into character I can imagine when the Oscars come around he's gonna get nominated for Best Actor I mean it's his movie they showed him in his glorifying moments but what I love most about his portrayals that they covered parts of his life that not too many people know about because throughout the whole movie I was like are they gonna cover that because not only does it affect his character but it also affects the civil rights movement in itself and they did cover it I'm not gonna tell you what it is but I was just another way for people to go against him so he can fail his mission he just showed that this legendary historical figure is vulnerable and I thought it was a great balance of character I mean even some of the supporting casts was really great like the woman who plays Coretta Scott King yeah I don't know where her name is either I feel really bad because they all have parts of where they stand out as their own character and I thought it was really cool being translated to scream and a part of that had to do with the extremely well-written script and the dialogue going on between the characters you know the movie Lincoln with Daniel day-lewis yeah we all know the dude owned that role those scenes were he's talking to someone and he's telling stories about his or something like that as he's speaking you're like yeah cool and you're taking something from his words same thing with a guy who plays Martin Luther King jr. he's given his speeches and you're just really inspired by that I'm serious I had a big fat dumb smile on my face during love scenes and when I got to the scenes of the civil rights movement holy  that was extremely hard to watch this movie is rated pg-13 so they couldn't fully capture the brutality of the situation so it was just enough to get to a point where it was horrifying since these activists got the kicked out of them just sucks what they had to go through so they can be equal to everybody imagine like that being televised like in this movie they wouldn't allow it of course bill would still be awful to watch it got emotional for some scenes and for a movie I gotta give it props now some parts in the movie like when it comes to the timeline I thought was just done okay cuz they get to certain moments of the movie where you feel it's important to MLK's mission and his cause but then all of a sudden it just cuts away and they don't handle that situation anymore I wish I would know more about that but I know it's a movie and there's only so much they can cover cuz I am a huge fan of history and it's always fun to know these little facts so summer was a great historical movie that was well directed and had a well-written script David what's his face from rise of the plan of the apes I hope he gets nominated for Best Actor and some of the supporting cast to some scenes were executed really good and some not so great I wish they would cover more on some parts but I'm not gonna hold it entirely because of that so I say Selma is worth the full price in theaters because it is a silver screen gem have you guys seen Selma what did you think about it whatever your thoughts are leave a comment below and a quick reminder my room is going through huge home improvements so I'm not gonna be on here for a couple of days like my video on the new Avengers age of Ultron trailer that might be coming late because my room is just being torn to  hopefully I'll be back to review black hat American sniper and so on so you know I can keep up because playing catch up really sucks but I'll still be on Twitter I'll still be on Facebook in which you can find in the description below but in the meantime I have to get going [Music] you [Music]
