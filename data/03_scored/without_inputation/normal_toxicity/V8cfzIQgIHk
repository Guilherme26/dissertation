opinion but like all forms of,0.0700023
media there are those that slip under the radar and don't get the recognition that they,0.06360532
deserve and one of those films in my opinion is the British film the war the third man directed by Sir Carol read and written by the famous novelist Graham Greene released in 1949 the film stars Joseph Cotten famous for his role in Citizen,0.10287429
Kane,
and the Hitchcock classic shadow of a doubt the stunning alida valli who would later appear in the italian horror classic Suspiria Trevor Howard and Orson Welles the film was also one of the last movies produced by the legendary David Selznick famous for producing Gone with the Wind first,0.0044628726
what is this movie about the plot involves an out-of-work pulp novelist Holly Martin's played by Joseph Cotten who arrives in post Second World War of Vienna to visit his ex school friend Harry Lime who unbeknownst to Martin had become a morally corrupt black-market drug dealer and racketeer as soon as he arrives however he learns that lime has recently died a mysterious traffic accident,0.07191405
he is told by police and lines associates that his death was an accident,0.18185388
but Martin becomes suspicious and sets out to prove that Harry Lime was actually murdered,0.33131582
when told by police chief major Calloway played by Trevor Howard about limes involvement with the black market Martin at first is skeptical but eventually learns the shocking and devastating truth of limes criminal history and to make things more complicated,0.028385743
he begins to fall in love with limes former lover played by Aleta Valley bird man now what makes this gym,0.102300346
so damn special well let's start with the acting Joseph Cotten gives a terrific performance,0.6663733
and as the naive hits strong-minded Polly Marcus who is unaware of how much danger he's getting himself into,0.35653657
what makes this character so engaging is his determination and stubbornness which acts as both a strength and a weakness also I just love how this guy talks he is such a smartass and always has a witty comeback to anyone he encounters particularly major Calloway you've been blundering around with the worst bunch of racketeers in Vienna your precious Harry's friends,0.5876557
and now you're wanted for murder but out drunk and disorderly,0.53761953
- I have what's the matter with your hand,0.12269358
Martin,0.04632812
I'm only a little fool I'm an amateur at it you're a professional alida valli and Trevor Howard both give memorable supporting performances in fact almost every character is unforgettable from Harry limes three dhruv's - the porter - sergeant Payne played by Bernard Lee who would become famous for playing em in the James Bond movies then of course there's Orson Welles playing the cynical Harry Lime this guy pretty much steals the show his charming demeanor disguise an inhuman monster within in my opinion Harry Lime became the architect for future immoral and corrupt villains with an unsympathetic attitude towards mankind and this speech perfectly sums up,0.6930448
Harry Lime if you ever seen any of your victims you know I haven't feel comfortable on these sort of things victims they melodramatic,0.23864354

this would be one of Orson Welles defining performances up there with Charles Foster Kane,0.038126152
and he would appear on many greatest characters and villains list including the AFIS top 50 villains the look of the film is outstanding the setting of the gloomy bombed ruins of Vienna almost becomes another character within the film itself,0.090045795
this is a movie where the location is just as noteworthy as the story and characters,0.05892751
according to reports Selznick wanted to shoot the entire film in a studio but director Carol Reed refused shooting nearly everything on the location unconventional,0.24052866
at the time however this is all highlighted by the imaginative and stunning cinematography the film is renowned for popularizing,0.03289087
the use of the Dutch angle which helps represents both Holly's role and the overall tone of the movie with the tilted angles suggesting a world out of joint and bizarre and lighting and intense shadows give the movie a unique and unforgettable visual style,0.06881952
finally there's the musical score composed by then-unknown Anton currents played entirely on the zither the story goes that Kel Reed hurt Karis playing at a production party and insisted that he record a few songs for the film midway through production Reed realized he wanted to use Kara's music for the entire film,0.06077167
and later flew Karis out to London to record the score for six weeks the rest as they say is history the main theme also known as the Harry Lime theme we're going to top many musical charts around the world and will go down as one of the greatest film scores of all time,0.043124758
now the making of the movie is just as interesting as the film itself most infamously is Orson Welles as difficulty onset reports have documented that Welles invaded production assistants and assistant directors while travelling in Europe when he was supposed to be on set resulting in reed having to film around the absent Welles using body doubles for establishing shops such as these Reid himself also stood in for Welles for one of the more famous shots of the film dumpling for Welles,0.059154373
his hands when they reached through the sewer grate two weeks after Welles was supposed to report to set he finally arrived things didn't go off too smoothly as Welles refused to film various shots in the famous kinetic scene in the sewers of the enemy resulting in duplicate sets having to be built in sound stages back to London,0.07729424
there are also rumors that Orson Welles wrote and directed all of the scenes however everyone involved including Welles himself denied these claims Welles did however improvise lime complaining about his stomach problems the same old indigestion honey he's the only thing as it helped these tablets for the last can't get him anywhere in Europe Damon,0.10658928
and the famous cuckoo clock line different pieces are gloomy after all,0.23250124
it's not that awful,0.2425888
now what the fella said Natalie for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare terror murder bloodshed,0.5385303
but they produced Michelangelo Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance in Switzerland they had brotherly love had 500 years of democracy and peace and what did that produce the cuckoo clock so long holiday,0.11778194
the shoot wasn't an easy task either as Reid had three separate film units working,0.12874274
throughout the shoot and Reid insisted of directing each one resulting in 20 hour work days and two hours of sleep per day Reid would later become dependent on the drug speed just to get through the shoot one final bit of trivia is the dispute over the ending of the film writer Graham,0.1594304
Greene had wanted a happy ending or Holly and Anna get together which contrasted with Greene who is known for his bleak depressing stories David Selznick on the other hand going against type as well demanded that Anna ignore Holly after the funeral,0.1456078
though reiden Selznick never got along unset Reid agreed with Selznick to which Greene eventually said was the right move I could go on about the detailed and complex story the behind-the-scenes drama the music performances the characters but really if you are a fan of film noir murder mysteries thrillers or hell,0.20552477
if you're a fan of film in general this is a must-see,0.057034753
it's truly one of the greats,0.046753064
