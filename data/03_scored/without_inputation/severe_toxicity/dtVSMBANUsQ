what is up guys we are back talking a brand new movie called the shape,0.046928708
of water this is one of my most anticipated movies for the award season due,0.019132677
to the fact that this movie is directed by del Toro this is one my,0.04653159
favorite visionary directors from pat slam Brent to Hellboy to crimson peak I actually did,0.106986806
enjoy pick a crimson peak I thought it was different and shaved water here is,0.019551743
different and I would like to say that I think this is del Toro is,0.018764166
best film to date I think every single film the guys directed beforehand has led,0.07717993
up to this moment and he's taking every strength and skill from those films and,0.068199284
pushed it into this movie and then any cons are negatives he's had those other,0.056923755
films he's whisked away and put into this brand new fairy tale that del Toro's,0.077148
dreamed up and it really is just immaculate how creative this film is but also,0.047445554
how beautiful the movie is itself that was a lot of love because this film,0.06368136
every single minute of this film made me fall more in love with it from,0.10016668
the characters written and performed by the actors in here or even from the mythology,0.021727558
brought into here with the fairytale aspect of this fish creature that we see because,0.0674137
I find this film to be a kind of a reference to Creature from the,0.06366473
Black Lagoon mixed it with a different type of fairy tale that's oddly gruesome and,0.028012214
weird at the same time but that's what del Toro does best and I think,0.050587215
that's what this film does amazingly well and the fact that creature from Black Lagoon,0.09704298
is probably my favorite horror monster it this kind of gave me a little bit,0.12623788
more love for this character it's fish creature played by Doug Jones who if you,0.029977167
guys don't know Doug Jones's look him up the guy is a really good actor,0.09639642
and I don't think he gets enough credit where it's due and him playing this,0.015125611
fish creature who really just has no dialogue he you believe in the emotion he,0.047386352
hits in them you believe in the character development that goes with this fish creature,0.09682147
and it's so greatly looked at I mean I have to really praise editorial I,0.0353299
mean that's was really more about prosthetics and makeup and stuff but the process is,0.026518876
to makeup really work on this character and I'm curious to see how much CGI,0.02829159
was actually used for the character because the makeup it looks so realistic like I,0.018441552
would have believed that this thing is something real that they found out that they,0.022708705
found in the real world I loved the look of the character he film really,0.019181902
works because of Sally Hawkins performance in here in Richard Jenkins performance because Sally Hawkins,0.027224636
plays a mute girl in here who really just works this facility this government facility,0.08340073
with Octavia Spencer who offed a via Spencer is also fantastic in here giving a,0.057372756
lot of the great comedic elements to this movie day this film is weirdly oddly,0.06298158
which it is a weird oddly movie but it also has weird oddly humor placed,0.024439512
into it which you would think all does not ruin the theme of the film,0.094547875
and the pacing no it actually enhances it which was weird because like I said,0.031110639
this is del Toro it has those weird kooky vibes to it but it works,0.08696544
for this dramatic undertone for the film because of course this film is overall a,0.028958105
fairy tale it's a weird gruesome fairy tale but it works but going back to,0.124595545
the performances Sally Hawkins I think this might be my second or third favorite performance,0.038581315
maybe it's tied up there with number one I don't know she is so good,0.05173732
in here and there's one scene in pretty with her character that I don't want,0.041158237
to get into but the way this scene was shot the way she performed in,0.11420272
that scene and the way del Toro had the camera whisking around in the scene,0.21661639
was amazing it's something that hasn't been in the trailer it's something that really is,0.015224058
an old throwback to older films the scene that is so different from this year,0.030088251
in genre that it really I think for some people could pull them out of,0.052067917
the movie but for me and enhance the role and enhance that moment in the,0.02227301
movie and I really fell in love with that scene I don't want to get,0.058907334
in the spoiler so I'm just gonna say that I think if you've seen the,0.029272072
movie you probably know what I'm talking about it's towards the later half of the,0.06669131
film cores Michael Shannon is also in the film and I mean Michael Shannon's great,0.016167289
when this is they do not a good actor he gives a good performance in,0.08055308
here not one of his best I would say I don't think it's reward worthy,0.05947274
but I think really Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins are fantastic in here Richard Jenkins,0.045719404
again one of the actors in here who brings a lot of Lebanese character developments,0.032041896
to him and I love where his character ends up going and I think he's,0.040918108
just a great friend to the character of Sally Hawkins I don't think I've even,0.027990263
talked about how this film was shocked the cinematography for the so I thought Blade,0.025568994
Runner was the most beautiful film of this year but I think this is like,0.018616494
right under that film I think this film is beautifully shot I think del Toro,0.09774209
is way of using the camera and moving it around especially with the underwater scenes,0.035488214
per se or even even the other amazing beautiful imagery you see in this film,0.075596794
this film is just beautiful it's like a portrait and I love saying that because,0.044019192
this is what this film really feels like it feels like paintings and drawings thrown,0.050541982
onto the big screen and I really just every second of this film made me,0.028899569
fall more and more in love with this film from the kooky weird themes of,0.09564609
the film to the great fairy tale aspect as well that totally meshed together well,0.04840475
because it's Del Toro's movie you totally know this is a del Toro movie from,0.04842138
acting from the actors and actresses in here being phenomenal from the creature really working,0.050715595
not feeling cheesy but really you can believe in this relationship between all the characters,0.024293836
in this creature from everything just working in general from that aspect humor really not,0.032602645
giving away the undertone of the drama of the scenes and that humor actually really,0.030155435
enhancing the movie the CGI is a beautiful the film's shot amazingly and I think,0.067256056
I have to talk about the score III think my favorite score from this year,0.01544623
is probably this one it's right up there with Blade Runner but these two are,0.014371293
my pawn my favorite scores from this year and I absolutely adored the score in,0.026389832
this film it really just goes back to the old classic movies they kind of,0.101445824
remind me of a little bit of Fallout as well but I love the score,0.039565124
of this movie and I just fell in love with the score I think the,0.07018153
scores will really make me fall in love with the film and just again the,0.045773946
word is enhanced every aspect of this some enhanced more and more of a reason,0.022056824
to why you should love this film and del Toro overall he's made a near,0.093770936
masterpiece here I think like again I said I think this is my favorite del,0.03469465
Toro film I think it's his best well-made film I will say I have one,0.07164227
con to the film and that con is I felt like the movies pacing at,0.021910485
times was slow it was a little slow at times and to build up and,0.053088307
then sometimes it would ramp it really fast and that was the one thing that,0.020410495
I don't think enhanced her meshed with the film at all but that's really just,0.04234293
a small con in the way of such an amazing film I can't wait to,0.061139025
see the shape of water again I really recommend you guys go check out the,0.043818306
shape of water so with all that said I'm gonna give the shape of water,0.025525758
and a - what we thinking I was gonna give this a perfect score um,0.047381695
I don't I think that con really did bother me especially more on thinking because,0.0446132
when I walk I was like you know on a a plus I loved it,0.06123082
then the more I thought about it I was like you know that pacing really,0.026645262
did kind of bother me at times but really I think Deltora took all the,0.1278483
strengths amped it up to 15 and made an amazing film here guys I think,0.03971745
