how everybody and welcome back to another Friday Friday Friday reviews Friday Friday Friday film review and today I'm really exciting so we were talking about a movie that is new with in cinemas while it came out in the UK at the weekend and I went to see it on Wednesday and it is inside out so i'm sure most of you probably already seen it inside out and then set out is definitely something i have been really excited about i'm waiting for for quite a long time since i saw the first trailer or like maybe teaser trailer and the picture which was kind of just up brain with a little things inside you from that poster that came out probably last year or so anyways I've been really excited about it I've seen the trailer which I know kind of goes against my thing I it just was everywhere that trailer I've recently I turned on it was a trailer beginning I think the trailer was when I want to see drastic world anyway so just you know I seen the trailer but why do say about inside out is they didn't give too much away with the trail I was definitely very surprised it was definitely different than I expected it to be and I really really enjoyed it and now something great I think about pixar which this is what I was I've been thinking about so sort last night and then today I've kind of been just kind of thing about our thoughts and I'm glad that I didn't do the review straight after I watched movies I definitely have more thoughts now into the next day and I think with Disney let you know frozen big here at six to mention recent ones and we get I leave a Disney movie feeling great and fun and like had a fun time I leave a Pixar movie my mostly not necessarily probably not with the monsters University at was a little bit different I think maybe but most Pixar movies i leave the Pixar movie and I really have a lot to think about that I think that's definitely one of those movies there's a scene in this movie that is just really really stuck with me I mean I wrote in a min a day but it really struck me and I can't wait to watch the movie again when it comes on blu-ray so yeah I'm definitely all for this movie I liked that I had a lot of thing for efforts but any nice get on to what the movies about so basically we have a little girl called Riley she's 11 in this movie I knew she was mom and dad she's only child and basically they move from I think Minnesota to San Francisco I think it's Minnesota than before I didn't move to San Francisco and obviously you know she's got to leave friends behind and she's got to go to a new school and she's got to leave her hockey team behind which he loves and all this stuff and she's kind of it's basically I've got the outside situation and then most of the story goes on with inside her head I'm sure you probably all know this I mean who doesn't know what inside-out us about yet but anyway we have the emotions inside the head which we have joy sadness disgust anger and fear is there any more joy sadness disgust anger and fear I think it's fat if ya know I said yeah and my favorite emotion was definitely sadness and I was really happy about how much she was actually in this movie at first I already had two felt like she was my favorite before was in the movie I was all excited for the movie I decided her like I played the little app on my phone which is actually really cool he hadn't played inside our app I'd recommend it's fun and yeah played the app and I've like sadness and I loved her in this movie chef that didn't disappoint me i think my second favorite character was probably joy she's kind of our main character because basically you know inside this headquarters where all these emotions are droids kind of in charge she's kind of wanting to keep Riley happy obviously you know and the others kind just bit in every now and then I'm see a joy I really liked as well now we also have a few moments but not very many I think maybe I would have personally likes her to be a few more of these moments cuz i found i'm really funny but I think maybe kids wouldn't as much but basically it's a few times when we get to inside the mom and dad's head and I thought that was hilarious i love that i loved the mom dad's heads I went inside there's I thought that was really funny those scenes definitely made me laugh the first half of the movie I definitely got a lot of laughs and I found it funny and it was relatable and it was cute and it was just it was funny discussed definitely made me laugh a lot at one point and I was just laughing I haven't really laughed too much like that in a movie before oh well not before but you know recently and it was so funny I'm so cute and then the second half of the movie definitely what I don't want to say sad it was kind of sad but not in a bad way not sad about it was just kind of that kind of heart hurting Lee sad but happy kind of thing I'm and it was surprising the way that it ended was definitely interesting I like the message obviously I can't give I don't wanna give too much wags if you have this in maybe I definitely think you should just go and see it and be surprising loved it but if you have seen you probably know all the things i'm talking about it if you need to explain it but um yeah there was things that happened i didn't expect you i could say we have kind of our main characters of joy and sadness they're kind of the main main 2 i'd say and and the relationship between the two of them was really really interesting I really loved it and I especially loved sad this his story that progress throughout the whole film I thought it's fantastic I loved it I loved the concept of it and the idea and the kind of message behind the whole story and then we also have another character called Bing bong and at first I was like being I'm not really gonna tell you who being wrong is you probably see a picture of him I thought what what is Bing bong Sao looked him off like what is this and yeah he's actually really really awesome and he's at first I kind of Italy was a warm to Bing bong and then once I'm warm to Bing bong I just loved being what I think he's probably he's a tie joy and Bing bong and my second favorite character I just loved them and I don't know there's so much thought kind of ending part in his situation after you've seen the movie he's definitely been known I've been thinking about the most since finishing a movie and I loved him he was great I'm see it all the carrots fantastic all the kind of iconic spent I don't say worlds because that's not quite what I mean but they they kind of go through a lot of places in the mind and its really interested for example you know the talk about long-term memory and the subconscious and deja vu and all these little cool online things like really cool which little kids might not get but definitely older people older kids will and like adults and you know stuff like that they will get fat and it's really cool how they've done that and it's just really quick I loved the memories and the core memories and it was just really really interested I mean I'm sure you could there's to be super unique I think that's what I love about it most it's just so original I've never really seen anything like it before and it was kind of felt like so much thought was put into everything in the movie and each character and I just loved it honestly I really really really enjoyed it can't wait to watch it again there's so much that can be said about it I'm sure we have probably heard somebody else say about it all you should definitely go and see it yourself I definitely would give it five stars I really really really enjoy it's a great Pixar movie I thought we can always rely on picsart and bring out our fantastic movie so yes definitely go see inside out you haven't already can't wait just I just AM all inside outness now I just kind of want it I don't know I just love all the characters I want to watch it again it was great it was lovely it was sad it was heartwarming it was funny it made me laugh and it's just all the stuff and see I looked inside out let me know down below what you think about inside up have you seen it who was your favorite character I definitely like to know that actually my favorite sadness my second favorite Sarge oi'm Bing bong and I realized off to all them it's not any character said I didn't like it wasn't really any bad like it wasn't really any villainous characters which was really really interesting because oftentimes this is the bad guy is the good guys it wasn't really like that we've definitely kind of had a deeper meaning to i think this movie which I really really liked yes if you guys have seen in set up let me know the Carlos thumbs up if you enjoyed this video this Friday
