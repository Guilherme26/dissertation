hi friends I'm back again I was going to do my Broadway and breakdown number 13 but I saw a movie today and felt I need to do a review about it so I saw a movie eighth grade day and warning and spoilers ahead for this video I will spoil it and the movie is radar so I will be talking about some sense of material so if you're not comfortable and don't want to be spoiled please turn it off now okay continuing on so um I did not know much about it going in I just started hearing about it like a week ago it came out everyone's like so good so real everyone needs to see this Oscar buzz and I really like real films like that kind of genre thing I like realistic endings it feels really important to me that's one of the reasons for everyone like hated la-la-land I loved it because ending was real the only like real movie I really don't like was boyhood but that's a whole nother discussion another day but like okay I like this so I went in this morning I saw a morning show so there's only one other person in the theatre I will say this person did walk out halfway through I'll talk about that scene in a minute but so it's about thirty I was a she's 13 not 13 year-old Kayla it's her last week of eighth grade she's very awkward doesn't have a lot doesn't have I wouldn't say have any friends and people say she's quiet and she's like I'm not quite I'm talking to and she's voted most quiet in her class that upset her and she opens her time capsule from sixth grade and she thought she was gonna be popular and obviously she's not just very episode that I did like a little Broadway stuff they had like she had a little Hamilton poster in her time capsule was a sign bring it on playbill so I love those little Broadway tidbits anyway so she's invited foursome cuz like her dad's friends with like another mom so like the parent thing she's basically she invites his party and the girl doesn't water there so she goes anyway and by the way her she lives her single dad nor Dodge struggling to relate with her with all of this social median stuff like there's a really awkward real dinner scene where she's not Instagram the whole time and he's just like what so anyway she's not the party um she has an anxiety breakdown in the bathroom it's very uncomfortable for her finally she gets out there she was out there and her one piece and everyone's wearing bikinis and she just feels awkward like but she gets in there sits outside the pool and then um the girl whose party is her cousin comes over and is nice towards that's nice or something and then she goes inside she's sitting in the corner on her phone and the guy she likes comes over and he's like mention slide that going to the rooms of course she goes in there and she tries she does karaoke it's great and I'm proud of her oh and she also makes YouTube videos on her webcam so gotcha girl so she's doing her videos and a happy comp and stuff but you know she's not and then she has because she's after last week eighth grade so she gets gone this field trip to her new high school and she is a mentor there and the girl is so nice to her and gets her and it's nice and then Kayla on a whim just decided to call her and ask her for advice and the girl Livia's like oh yeah come hang at me my friends at the mall so he was excited she's hanging out front of the mall she's never done that her dad drops her off they're having a good time but it's weird because she's 13 and 8th grade and they're seniors it's not like sorry about that but so it's kind of like why are they hanging out with her like I gets a nice thing but still weird and then her dad comes by and obviously it's she's like why you stalking me and she's like sleeve I'll get a ride home so everything's going fine so the girl Olivia her friend who's a guy friend and then Kate lives in the back seat so he's driving them home and he's like let me drop Kayla first and she's like and well they sick drop Kayla offers and then he's like no you live right here so he drops Olivia off so thirteen-year-old girl alone in the car with a high school senior it's not good obviously tracer pressure her and hooking up and it's not good it's sad luckily he just doesn't hit the rape side so that's good luckily she is home safely it's sad yeah and then she's trying to and then next day she's trying to impress her crush turns out he broke up with his last girlfriend because she didn't send news it's like but anyway and then so she's like she hints that she is dirty picture and that she doesn't send he's intrigued as a whole thing so this is a scene where the guy walked out the theater because the guy she likes mentions so then she goes and Google's it and the guy caught that theater anyway said luckily nothing happens always good always swell and then she decides to be friends with the cousin that she met at the party he messaged her on Instagram and he talked and it's nice and he gets them a 20-pack chicken nugget the share with every sauce and it's really cute it's nice she's making strides in the right direction and then with the help of her dad she burns her sixth-grade time capsules she burns her time capsule and the thing that made me sad is why to burn that side brigid odd playful those were worth a lot about you anyway so she burns it she's like I'm bringing my hopes and dreams are you sad to have me his daughter he's like no I'm proud of you it's a nice thing and then she decides to make a time capsule first off to open in four years when she graduated high school it's nice and you can see so I'm like because it's like a hopeful ending but it's not ending and I like those because the thing is and one way or together either my all-time favorite from Breakfast at Tiffany's has a crystal clear nice wrap it up in a bow ending whereas other films like la-la-land the ending is real and hits you so I really like the ending of eighth grade I think it's a really good movie I think it's important to see um I think like a lot of people who like the romantic comedies in life or like the blockbusters will not like it's not a mainstream film not a lot of dialogue not la characters it's very much in the mind of her so if you like realistic films are are okay being inside the mind of thirteen-year-old girl then definitely it's great but yeah so overall I think 8th grades are good film I can definitely see it getting a word but I don't see it winning though because I think a lot of things will beat it it's gonna be a heavy season between stars Boren and all the other good stuff so definitely but it creates a good film I highly recommend it so go ahead and watch it and now hopefully I will be posting the Broadway breakdown 13 next I am working at leakycon next two days so that'll be fun I'm talent handler for Dan Fogelman so that's exciting so I'll be doing that and then I'll be posting my Broadway breakdown videos so thanks guys hope you enjoyed the video
