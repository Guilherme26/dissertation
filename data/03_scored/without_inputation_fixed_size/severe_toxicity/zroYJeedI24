bit later towards the end of the year so let's get into the film so,0.052370574
mouse Morales who is voiced by shameik Moore who you know from dope and Shaolin,0.20381826
fantastic from the get down so essentially he voices Miles Morales who is his young,0.07045559
teen he's a so um Latino and so basically he's going through a tough time,0.123804644
because he's feeling caught in between two different worlds as his Paris wants him to,0.03205387
go to this really bougie boarding school and so after just trying to rebell in,0.08008079
for a night he gets caught up with to a little song something and I'm,0.04323361
not gonna give it away cuz I'm gonna get the plot away to you guys,0.0763112
in case you don't know what is going on with this movie but essentially Myles,0.044997014
has to save the world okay because some stuff got messed up and not only,0.05386391
do we have Myles who is spider-man okay we have 15 million different spider people,0.060221072
running around because there's different timelines that have been impacted and all these different spire,0.01930363
people come together to defeat this evil threat it's okay and that's all I'm gonna,0.18744941
say so let's go ahead and get into what I liked about this film first,0.051189207
and foremost can we get on this soundtrack because when the music started playing there,0.015418292
was a certain song that was clear I was like oh so yeah really going,0.034062058

I'm definitely buffing this soundtrack when it comes out and I need to check it,0.037618797
out yes I can go ahead and start buffing this on the way to work,0.057000253
tomorrow but I love the music for this film I'm also to the animation what,0.031699993
I love about animated films and why this makes the most perfect spider-man movie the,0.08907341
bed spider-man movie out of all the spider-man movies it's just that there's no limit,0.08705924
to what you can do with animation as far as what spider-man can and cannot,0.047661074
do and so I have to say the animation is so top-notch that you truly,0.03173059
feel like you're watching a comic book literally I felt like I was going through,0.064699754
frame by frame by frame of reading a comic book and I was just like,0.03169334
wow you guys did a very great job hood says even from where Mouse is,0.015277938
talking to himself you see the little the boxes that you would see if you,0.042266432
were reading the comic to hear his inner thoughts and I just thought it was,0.03233391
so great even with the noises you see just how they perfectly drew this film,0.042457342
and turning into this animated film it was so beautifully well done it as I,0.07951006
said in my intro this movie has already been nominated for a Golden Globe I,0.06896158
truly believe that it has what it takes to take best animated films for the,0.02761776
Golden Globes and to also earn an Oscar nomination and to actually win in that,0.013185935
category also - I didn't know all these people was in this you had should,0.026735727
make more who was playing Miles Morales then you had we had Jake Johnson who,0.025835732
was playing Peter B Parker you had zoe kravitz in this you had Chris Pine,0.022992073
in this Oscar Isaac Liev Schreiber I was just like dang how much are these,0.0680862
people to be in this movie because yeah I was just jamming yeah so John's,0.05797142
gonna come for everybody's thoughts what everybody's voicing these characters in this film and I,0.046195675
love that the focus still remains on miles I have to say that was a,0.015689686
little weird because I was just like yeah kind of changing it up a little,0.058159668
bit especially with throwing so many different characters from different you know from different Spider,0.084393844
versus into the mix I really felt that for a moment I was worried that,0.03301905
the attention was gonna be taken away from Miles but I'm happy to say that,0.024738844
it wasn't we got to see a lot of his interactions with his family on,0.060388032
personal things that he was going through with his family betraying relationships with his father,0.08595503
and then also to relationships between him and his uncle who was voiced by my,0.06211751
Hershel I'll eat another I was like wow that you hair Brian Harry tyrita was,0.12495674
voicing his father I was just like y'all did that but to see the relationship,0.04222719
from the bottom between a black a young black man in his black father and,0.13592495
also to with the Latino aspect I thought it was so amazing to watch and,0.07194161
one of my favorite scenes of this movie is this scene where Merrill's is kind,0.041233405
of walking from school from home to his new school and kind of this code-switching,0.047035802
thing that he goes through and he's going through kind of like talking in slang,0.08540093
with his friends and then also to going through I'm him speaking Spanish as well,0.021285877
and so I thought that was so freaking cool I mean I also had a,0.08265904
chance to interview more at the Lennon red carpet premiere which I want to be,0.046600107
posting an interview after this video he actually I'm learning Spanish from The Voice coaches,0.03149445
and it was really important to make sure that they brought in Miles his culture,0.025787175
I'm from being afro Latino and I thought it was great to see on screen,0.30272612
I really loved this movie yah I'm not gonna give too much away about this,0.04609257

different ones and I was like that was cute you guys did a really great,0.05698096
job with that so much of a great job but I was just like why,0.032301985
couldn't you put this effort this energy into all the other spider-man movies that you,0.056687616
