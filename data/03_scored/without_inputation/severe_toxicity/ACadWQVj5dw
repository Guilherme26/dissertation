end of the 18th century a female painter is obligated to paint a wedding portrait,0.04001279
of a young woman simple premise right but I was looking and I was like,0.048678804
I see so many amazing different scores and reviews cinema scores I think right now,0.013235159
currently out of 93 rating so I was like what is it about this story,0.030003773
what is it about this film that has elevated people's response like this and I,0.035560053
will tell you this is one of the best films I've seen all year this,0.024616452
probably is one of the best foreign films I've seen in the past three years,0.02302267
to be quite honest with you now break it down and tell you why so,0.058480952
breaking out from the cinematography what they were able to do with a lot of,0.031128598
the shots we're just mind melting because it opens up on the the ocean you,0.10480899
have Mary and is going to the island and kind of going with her painting,0.017902087
materials and try to do everything she need to do and the first thing that,0.019155294
happens she has to go over for some unseen reason but the camera never leaves,0.054997385
the atmosphere what I mean by that is mary-louise again is an artist and they,0.03098492
take so much careful detail to the way she paints the way she draws the,0.027761439
way that the characters interact they are very personal istic there's an amazing moment by,0.026417103
a campfire that there's this Harmonist ik like noise is happening where people are singing,0.11345439
people are dancing but the way that this actually shot is just so it pulls,0.1494182
you in on so many different levels but at the same time there's an elegance,0.055338625
behind it because a big part of this film is the love story is the,0.03481305
the essence of art and the beauty behind like painting and drawing and just the,0.018285898
art form in general and it goes from different ranges of that it can go,0.013788592
from at a certain point there was a moment where hey Louise and Mary Andy,0.011415216
are going at a piano and Mary Louise starts to play this interesting tune and,0.018434234
like you're just immersed into that now one of the biggest key points about this,0.074477956
is the sound the score there is technically no rhythmic score throughout the film it's,0.028301569
very silent film but their attention to detail whether it's the waves whether it is,0.012200133
the the paint Brussels hitting against the canvas whether it is like the interaction like,0.04912714
the human touch whether it's like this unseemly moment where it feels very uncomfortable and,0.050176132
like you hear like the scratching of like a chair or like something going on,0.053059705
in the background or like at a campfire you hear the popping of the the,0.023530206
wood or the materials or the the leaves this crackling the sound design is perfect,0.02729049
because it lays the atmosphere for everything that's actually happening what other film kind of,0.024837958
did something similar to that which was a lighthouse where their atmosphere was one of,0.022751942
the biggest catalyst for the film but there's there's technically not a real big score,0.0245945
throughout this it's just the sound design is just perfect now let's go to the,0.015711637
platform of the actual actresses and the people that were played in it fit with,0.029355885
this so within this of course you have Adele Hansel know me Marlin with the,0.020146417
main two leads but you also have apologize for I'm not even gonna try to,0.014611424
name her her last name but Luna plays a role of Sophie and Valeria garli,0.021939753
no plays a role of like Humpty's who is hey Louise's mother and really that's,0.06311994
it there is no other cast there's really not any male characters that are primary,0.052622013
leaves or secondary leads the only time you actually see male figures in this film,0.06792323
are they're going and carrying luggage or their the background or people are talking about,0.019042877
what their connection is with this now again this is a very this is a,0.013517862
French film English subtitles but there was never a moment that I have missed the,0.02703639
step there was never a moment I felt like I had to pause because that,0.023914017
was going to class it's very paced very well matter of fact I would say,0.074318305
its pace perfectly because the the tension builds with the relationships that are had because,0.020076573
when Mary Louise when not Mary Louise when Mary Ann gets there like she's kind,0.07428771
of like put in the situation where like okay nobody's helping me to get here,0.092547
I need to get where I need to go but she's very independent she's very,0.038183536
you know passionate and the actress that plays the role of Mary Ann is so,0.013768637
perfect because she comes across very crass and yet passionate and very artsy but yet,0.04036135
standoffish but then she like consistently kind of drinks wine consistently you know smokes her,0.11940578
pipe and so you know she's kind of like trying to think trying to process,0.02830955
trying to get into her own headspace but keeping people to a distance where the,0.043697245
other side of that the parallel to that is hey Louise who really just doesn't,0.018824697
want her face to be painted I'm not gonna say the reasons why but she,0.13012987
doesn't want to be painted she kind of like wants to be on her own,0.027784055
and she's had tragedies before her life that's platformed her to the way in the,0.085287854
direction she goes now then they are connected together and these actresses are so amazing,0.03211706
because the thing about it is yes they can act there's in their scenes and,0.027520644
the moments just by themselves they can act very well but when they are together,0.019737994
like it is some of the most amazing imagery of art and compassion and empathy,0.054622885
and stress and worry and concern and empathy that are stretched through all different levels,0.039762683
in the short amount of time in the gap of this film and I was,0.03208713
like there's so many different raw emotions that are so efficiently done that I was,0.06963475
I was captivated I'm gonna be very honest I was very much so captivated and,0.041484844
then they interact with the younger person who Sophie who kind of like you know,0.039630312
taking care of the place and kind of not undertake it but she has her,0.101900816
own store she has her own atmosphere that's going on but there's never a moment,0.02667453
where you feel like all this so dreary and so drought that's one of the,0.037691303
things about favor up that towards the the third half of the film I was,0.045374837
kind of mean isn't the present man is is rough there are moments of levity,0.07175934
not just comedy but just like natural progression of characters like they come to really,0.0168205
come into their own come into who they're meant to be who they are to,0.09593278
each other and this all different ranges of emotions that are effortlessly effortless effort Leslie,0.012693699
done and displays through the screenplay because the screenplay I think plays the most part,0.023276106
of it I'm not sure how much of this was improv but it felt like,0.026923973
the script was just tight and I mean I have to give credit where credit's,0.013748015
due when it comes to the directing for this one because the movie knew exactly,0.018323814
what it needed to be it didn't try to reach it didn't try to go,0.017304752
super natural we didn't try to go too artsy it was the perfect blend of,0.02705701
every one of those different dimensions of genre and again Celine Saima I give her,0.052638642
a lot of credit because this right here to me should be and would be,0.032435685
in my personal opinion up for Best Picture nomination not just best foreign film I've,0.027893146
not seen parasite I've heard great accolades about that I've also not seen what was,0.050075024
the other film was a farewell I haven't seen that but this film right here,0.014644683
to me could be a contender for best picked and for me I give this,0.053505376
nothing less than a ten out of ten I know I didn't go too much,0.066022806
into the story I think that the the mood and the movie in himself it,0.040037405
immerses you enough that you are gonna make this story in and out what you,0.043552235
feel it's gonna be and what you feel behind it and by the end of,0.053998943
it you know I was in tears I was laughing I was taking it back,0.050323803
with every single moment and I think that the the the cast were amazing the,0.023230208
sound design was excellent the cinematography was immaculately beautiful and the essence behind art form,0.02904591
mix with camaraderie friendship love is the spread throughout this entire film and they just,0.0350605
glistens perfectly it is the perfect painting I think that's the best way of kind,0.074524514
