and you guys should go check out their channel it's really cool and they have,0.07200946
some really cool videos and thank you so much for the request i was actually,0.018613169
planning on rewatching this movie anyway and this was at a perfect time and if,0.09460708
any of you guys have any requests or any type of video you guys want,0.09448268
to see on my channel make sure to leave them down in the comments in,0.15300886
any of my videos because i'm always checking and looking for new ideas but yeah,0.049652632
let's talk about the shape of water this is actually a movie that i saw,0.033540554
once i finished watching the 2018 oscars i always watch them and every time a,0.03021131
movie gets a lot of praise i'm really interested in seeing what it was about,0.03628843
especially when at that time i hadn't really watched as many movies as i do,0.02341513
now i didn't really know what the shape of water was when i first saw,0.020782333
it and to be honest i didn't like it that much the first viewing i,0.03879883
remember i saw it that same year 2018 i think i was like a sophomore,0.030839244
in high school i can't remember i didn't really like it as much and i,0.024578536
didn't understand its praise everybody was talking about it and i didn't like it but,0.041241385
i recently saw pan's labyrinth which is also a movie directed by guillermo del toro,0.05501002
and he has amazing movies you can tell he's very passionate about what he does,0.022126669
and he's amazing at production design and color and direction but for me the story,0.020177016
wasn't working the first time i saw it and i'm really really happy to say,0.053686973
that that has changed because i really really liked this movie i can't talk about,0.03435075
this movie enough without mentioning the production design it is so amazing and this movie,0.06668599
is very blue and greenish but it has some hints of that like mint green,0.024042398
from the 60s and 50s and it is just a very beautiful color palette especially,0.012653789
for this movie a lot of this movie is in the dark since sally hawkins,0.10980652
care is a cleaning lady working at night most of it has to do at,0.10447507
night so there's a lot of really dark beautiful scenes that make it possible to,0.049250197
have really beautiful lighting and i think guillermo dodo used that to his advantage it,0.18092197
was so beautiful there are so many beautiful scenes with alleyways and it's just like,0.050724246
a beautiful looking film even this movie had a really bad plot which i used,0.06107051
to think when i first saw it i have always loved the production design and,0.024733523
it is such a beautiful looking movie also something that i love about this movie,0.053127553
is that every single scene doesn't feel out of place everything feels like it flows,0.03465873
correctly it's not one of those movies where there is a random scene of violence,0.1124779
or there's a random scene of this and that like it feels like another director,0.031198444
did it all of this you could tell that it's the same director because it,0.037131883
has a very similar style and i think that's really important when a director has,0.009643167
a specific style because it makes the movie that much better the acting of this,0.025800478
movie is great michael shannon is really scary in this movie and they they have,0.034654737
this guy ripping his own fingers off so he is clearly very menacing and every,0.33067617
single time he came on the screen i wanted to punch him in the face,0.8416842
so he's a very evil character and his acting was great he's always really good,0.20673375
as well in everything that he does and you have octavia spencer she's kind of,0.052109156
like her friend at work and is always trying to help her and i really,0.02848915
liked her addition to the story and she's also always really great there's richard jenkins,0.014391913
and he's like really really nice he's like one of the like the sweetest characters,0.030898446
in the movie and i also really liked his performance can't believe i forgot to,0.030108873
mention the creature dude he also did really good but the one that shines for,0.06205498
me the most in this movie is sally hawkins and she's playing a mute lady,0.13923557
and she doesn't say many words actually she doesn't speak at all in this movie,0.033641662
and she her performance just says so much and that's so amazing because once you,0.04612184
take away something like speaking which is a way of people you know talking about,0.070115015
their emotions it really really allows the movie to be way more interesting because it,0.03586271
shows there's different ways of communicating that don't have to be with your voice and,0.019674137
this is just a very beautiful movie with very like outstanding acting and i just,0.034929458
loved her performance she did so good and everything about her like she portrayed so,0.026876746
many emotions in a movie without ever saying one word and i think that says,0.044935152
a lot about her performance and i'm so happy that at least she got an,0.03182571
oscar nomination because she very well deserved it and her character is obviously the essence,0.0870752
of the story and i really like what they did with her especially that feeling,0.030775387
of not feeling fulfilled with your life and feeling like something's missing that's a very,0.04530366
relevant theme in life in general and obviously in this movie and i definitely really,0.067436315
like what they did with that and i also really enjoyed with the screenplay which,0.030287141
is fantastic how they were able to take something that our main character is feeling,0.019356845
but apply to mostly all the characters actually that's not that i think of it,0.020730449
all of the main characters in the story like every single person in this feels,0.025353475
like they have to fill in some type of like void in the movie and,0.10558859
they feel incomplete and i think what the movie has to say about that is,0.020556835
very interesting as well as human connection as well as just connection and that it,0.11583575
doesn't just have to be human connections and the connection extends from just human to,0.031561635
human and i i thought that the messages of this movie were very beautiful and,0.108144894
i'm really really happy that i rewatched it because when i first saw this when,0.054859027
i was younger i didn't really it didn't click for me i was like okay,0.0478134
this is just weird a weird looking alien dude with a girl i didn't understand,0.24952039
it but it is so much more than than their connection which is of course,0.026135065
very relevant in the movie it and it's not just a love story it's a,0.025499815
lot more than that and this movie has a lot of layers and that's why,0.015269956
i also think it is so amazing and it's it's just really awesome i ca,0.07222631
i don't even know how many other words to say about this because it's just,0.048382796
you have to watch it and see because i think the messages portrayed in this,0.030016411
movie are very important and relevant to a lot of people and i think it's,0.03694829
kind of ironic that such a strange looking movie with a strange plot that can,0.053310476
not happen is very relevant and realistic to a lot of people which i think,0.1037753
that's what makes a movie that much better than other movies honestly the one negative,0.030666297
that i would have with this movie is that some scenes do make me feel,0.058265433
weird and uncomfortable but that's just a personal preference i'm not going to take too,0.030822614
much away from the movie i mean that's what he wanted to do i think,0.04832559
this movie was very bold and what it was trying to do which i really,0.04924155
admire in a filmmaker and in a movie when movies are don't play it safe,0.026965879
and this movie definitely didn't play it safe but just like that's like the one,0.014522955
thing that's kind of weird sometimes i'm like you know but it's just like i,0.055669885
still really enjoy this movie and i'm going to give this movie an a one,0.10374803
of the most original movies i've ever seen he never fails to make an original,0.030933036
movie and his style really really shines and i'm pumped i just want to see,0.06658089
all his movies now which maybe maybe i should do that you know since i,0.047186133
finished watching all the christopher nolan movies maybe i should watch all of his and,0.28534034
make that a series i think that that would be very fun thank you guys,0.039343618
so much for watching and if you guys have seen the shape of water let,0.03406871
me know down below what you thought this movie was actually available on fx i,0.11993594
it was for free i mean i have it with my television so it just,0.04740631
came with that so if you guys have that all you have to do is,0.032819495
go on fx and stretch up the shape of water or if you guys have,0.18811992
already seen it please make sure to let me know what you thought i would,0.036789976
love to hear it and thank you again to trailer recuts for leaving this suggestion,0.061107762
i loved rewatching it and i'm very happy that i did because i love changing,0.03648865
opinions about movies and i think that should be very normalized in the film community,0.022445956
you could hate a movie and then suddenly love it so yeah i really liked,0.13579857
this movie and it was a really fun watch thank you guys again for watching,0.03091707
