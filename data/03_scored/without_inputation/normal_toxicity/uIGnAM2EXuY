hello,0.054463096
everyone it is I here to bless you all with some horror content on this fine morning afternoon evening or place this time in the void that you may be watching this video,0.31089434
now we have recently had Jordan peels latest entry into the genre released two outstanding feedback from fans,0.05352757
and critics alike with a scoring big for its beautiful visuals and dark central message hidden away in the subtext of course,0.08690368
this is all very unsurprising given his fantastic,0.11708893
first work of get out since us pretty much doubles down on the unique vision and socio-political commentary style that was built up there to cement it as Jordan peels,0.06984909
think whilst both are brilliant movies us does venture away from the solid clear narrative of get out by offering up a far more complicated and nuanced look at an impossibly broad issue in America meaning that it might not hit quite the lofty heights of the first film in the process it is still great and is miles ahead of many Hollywood horrors we've become used to but that doesn't mean it's not without a few issues opening up to far more questions and in answers by the end of the film but let's get to it,0.050627127
they're nice looking for you guys,0.06836168
this is a spoiler free review meaning,0.08574401
you can watch before or after the movie in relative peace that you'll still get a great and surprising experience,0.14891428
overall isn't that nice to give,0.105118245
the briefest impression of the plot then we follow adelaide wilson mother to sora and jason and wife to gabe as the foregone Holliday de Santa Cruz to get some relaxation in with another family the Tyler's however when strange coincidences start mounting up Adelaide is haunted by a memory from her past one that culminates in being terrorized by a monstrous group of doppelgangers named as the ted-ed,0.19001904
oh it's very spooky,0.27964032
let's start with a look at the tone of us then which V is wildly between horror and comedy on a knife-edge of bizarre character work truthfully I believe the horrible vocalizations of the doppelgangers to be some of the most chilling horror work since that horrible noise from The Grudge,0.16312037
but there is plenty that would argue that it is straight-up hilarious he'll definitely manages to portray what it's like to be in a situation,0.14786987
so surreal that it's laughable but maintains our sinister knowing that builds read underneath the surface hora as a whole is terrifying and serious yes,0.2558182
but the nature of the genre is for reaction,0.0913065
which is why it lends itself so well to humor Pele recognizes this and uses it to his advantage which some may not like but it's effective in establishing the psychotic underbelly to these characters which wouldn't be half as scary,0.19853413
otherwise Pele has had to do this as he also tried stoned,0.40504727
some well-worn ground of the genre in beginning with a fat home-invasion trope incorporating what we've seen a thousand times before but reimagining it as something new there's points where else loses its tension and has to work hard to pull us back in because of this but when it gets back on track,0.16187619
it is absolutely nail-biting to see whilst a tone might wobble occasionally Lupita Nyong'o as Adelaide never does if there's any one reason to watch us it is absolutely yong-go who undoubtedly gives one of the strongest performances of the year so far majul performance,0.08720108
in fact as Adelaide and her tethered equivalent rate,0.1022219
the tricky nature of the movie's premise requires Nyong'o to make a lot of complex choices,0.05146351
whilst also juggling the duality of her two characters and she knocks it out of the park as both the wide eyed shell-shocked Adelaide and the obscenely creepy red Nyong'o is absolutely captivating owning the screen at all times and easily propping the movie up even when the script sometimes falters the early Oscar talk surrounding her performance isn't unfounded as Nyong'o once again confirms herself to be an extraordinary talent and the film would be a much tougher sell without her presence in it,0.16625218
and of course Winston Duke as Gabe also puts in an absolutely solid portrayal of himself and the tether to bringing them much-needed humour in full force with his dad shenanigans child actors,0.1454123
Shahar,0.017492844
deride joseph on Evan Alex are a little rough around the edges in comparison though you can hardly blame them when they're up against these two forces of nature,0.19231458
as their movie parents to be honest,0.16112489
but there is moments when it can be a little distracting to not be sold entirely on their terror as their tethered counterparts though they are fantastic,0.15625703
they're very good I'll hand that to them,0.09068093
I also have to shout out the tireless - with Elizabeth,0.24601154
moss and Tim Heidecker Heidecker especially fantastic in their supporting,0.07294228
roles every movie needs more hair slick moments and you'll know what I mean when you see,0.10746944
it now we want more negative aspects of the movie easily the biggest issue or at,0.073433794
least its most divisive aspect is born from the script while undeniably detailed unambitious it doesn't feel,0.17475185
remotely it has watertight as his oscar-winning script forget,0.15288763
out the starters character a narrative logic is rather inconsistent right leaving a whole load of questions about the actuality of what happens since it's sacrifice to make the subtext stronger peel arguably gives away his big conceit a little too early,0.08687931
whilst the later section of the movie flatly over explains,0.079288185
details which would have been so much better left ambiguous us isn't a badly written movie by any means but it does ultimately feel like a less coherent jumble of intriguing yet half-baked ideas that don't really add up to a satisfying whole at least on the surface us is a movie that works far better when looking at its underlying allegory which I will leave for you to discover and to Josh to explain in our ending video whereas previously peel has very successfully married the two without sacrificing anything in the process it is still a great watch which I want to emphasize but it's definitely not a perfect one as a whole construction moving on to peels direction though us feels decidedly ambitious visually with punchy shot selections and an abundance of images which stick firmly in your head,0.17577204
he cleverly uses visuals to hide P clues about the nature of the pot which are sure to make subsequent viewings extremely rewarding needless to say Pele makes pretty much,0.09704363
every shot of us either stylish or information dense showing considerable growth as a filmmaker in the process knowing how deviously pele constructed his previous film,0.09404694
it is undeniably fun scanning every frame of this movie and paying extra attention to every morsel of dialogue singing out hints for what might be unfolding especially when it looks this good with attention lavished over colour schemes and angles that mean you could watch this whole thing in silence and still come away feeling overwhelmed,0.074964866
though you really wouldn't want to do that however as the absolute pinnacle of this movie's technical prowess comes in its a depth use of music,0.091708384
for starters that rap classic I got five on it is never one you'd imagined ahead of the horror movie yet they managed,0.15386802
it here later on retreated to other such pop remixes that work to incredibly measure effect too but it is the score that is the real star of the show employing nerve rattling string work and accounting for much of the film's mood that haunting chant will stick with you long,0.06832208
after the credits have rolled on Adelaide's quite seriously,0.092608236
I cannot get across how good the music work is in this film aspirants similarities to get out which we've got to address first is a film which invites a wealth of interpretation from the viewer and regardless of peels own intent when penning the script audiences are naturally going to walk away with their own conclusions,0.07277515
thankfully Pele keeps the precise nature of his message ambiguous this time beyond declaring pre-release that he was majorly concerned with the notion of we're our own worst enemy,0.19436501
again the great strength of us is in challenging,0.050663766
the viewer to make sense of its more ambiguous and mysterious central themes compared to get out which laid out with comparative obviousness though one can argue also greater effectiveness,0.08041215
in either case the film should be commended for giving viewers a plenty to ponder combined with its breathtaking visuals and spine-tingling use of music deft humor and brilliant acting as well as a whole load of genre thrills that show a brand-new side to horror we've not experienced before despite the similar situations and us is a landmark movie for horror despite the flaws that lie in its heart,0.10029309
if you don't like a dose of non realistic humor in dark situations and cannot past a plot hole or two for a tapestry of big and small messages under the surface,0.11253543
you won't like this movie it should be noted from me then us comes highly recommended,0.16128667
if you go in with an open mind and reward you with a wealth of opportunities to enjoy it's beautifully rendered world as well as dig deep into a dark real issue in the American underbelly that Peale puts on screen put simply just go and watch it,0.13736168
it is worth your time and money peelers define himself as the next well Jordan peeled as he's unlike anything,0.099269725
we've seen in the genre before,0.052674193
so there is my review of the movie a solid seven and a half out of ten all rounded up a four out of five stars,0.07551882
but what do you think,0.061720062
