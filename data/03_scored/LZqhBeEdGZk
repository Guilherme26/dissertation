"we are and thank you guys for sticking with me for 1,000 videos it must",0.15887035
have been really painful and the second reason is I am reviewing the last film,0.11200169

now i mentioned earlier this ends the file film 2 stars Hugh Jackman as the,0.05560104
titular and iconic character Logan aka Wolverine it's also the final appearance of passive Stewart,0.11598435
as Professor Xavier as he too stated that he's going to be retiring from the,0.09149955
role after this film so Logan is basically an end of an arrow type film,0.11327735
as we have seen these two portrayed these characters for close to 20 years and,0.05834176
now it's all come to an end so there was no way that I was,0.06741687
missing out on seeing Logan I grew up with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and I,0.09833233
will be there for his last film and I was super excited the trailers are,0.06777033
freaking awesome it's freakin rated R which got me really excited so we could see,0.5474845
some really intense who are some a gritty action from Wolverine the type of action,0.09454945
we've always wanted to see so I could not wait to see Logan and after,0.04939637
watching the film what did I think about it well let's get into it shall,0.10765767
we first thing worth mentioning about Logan was its action this is without a doubt,0.09791107
the most gruesome action I have ever seen in a Wolverine film and it's exactly,0.18037458
the kind of action we all have been waiting to see in a Wolverine film,0.14892665
you guys remember that one spectacular action sequence in Xmen apocalypse we're Wolverine is mowing,0.06528399
down guys left to right we'll take that one scene from x-men apocalypse and extend,0.16371554
it by two hours that's the sort of high-octane action you get to witness in,0.08207477
Logan it's exhilarating bloody and also fun to watch with so many awesome and gratifying,0.55427724
kills I mean you got head piercings limbs flying everywhere blood spewing all over the,0.73552686
place it's just over-the-top action goodness the acting is tremendous especially Hugh Jackman as Logan,0.07969384
aka Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier no surprise there this was honestly the,0.12194168
most challenging and riveting performance I've seen Hugh Jackman give as the character Logan /,0.031323437
Wolverine and he has to portray a much older weaker and vulnerable Logan while still,0.12615865
maintaining the reluctant hero persona as well as a sinister ferocity and in my opinion,0.31826586
he pulled it off perfectly and I expect no less it was a near-perfect swan,0.15044014
song for a character that has been his for 17 years and I will miss,0.053806335
him dearly after this film Patrick Stewart's also try something new with his portrayal of,0.14945866
Charles Xavier a more new approach to the character it says of the smart reasonable,0.07021695
and collected professor figure that we have known in love for many years TC now,0.038152277
mentally unstable and crass it was quite jarring to see to say the least I,0.4279948
mean the once great Professor X brought down to a doddering old fool my heart,0.7150256
did break but it made for one of the most memorable and emotional heart-wrenching performances,0.057962243
in the entire film that is just neck-and-neck with Hugh Jackman's performance and a little,0.099492304
girl that plays Laura was pretty good too a feisty little one she is you,0.20170066
do not want to get on her bad side ever and it to go without,0.14927638
saying that the actors as well as the characters that they play has convincing and,0.053411435
dynamic chemistry with Logan and Charles being the strongest no surprise there I mean these,0.07965488
two have been in almost every single x-men film together the story here is solid,0.07593424
and engaging for the most part many high points many low points I enjoyed the,0.08138991
journey aspects of the story there's a lot of great emotional things a lot of,0.013579538
kick-ass action scenes it's a well told well structured and enthralling story and it had,0.6594111
a very Western vibe to it throughout the entire film which makes sense given what,0.043268904
type of story is and also a very very very fitting ending for a story,0.07416702
like this and lastly all the technical aspects ranging from cinematography visual effects sounds and,0.053555127
all that jazz were well done so it seems as though Logan was the perfect,0.08281234
send-off for Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine character now we can ride triumphantly to the,0.106409185
sunset right right right well actually I do have a couple issues with the film,0.07777779
Logan and I feel like many of you have your Wolverine claws shooting out of,0.43989044
your fists like what how could you find anything wrong this movie this movie's an,0.43546873
edge of masterpiece Tony when you're talking about your nonsubscribers just like this video all,0.24174607
you're a terrible person calm down listen to what I have to say and remember,0.7703148
that overall I love this film it's a really really really enjoyable film but it,0.11210736
is not without its flaws my biggest problem with this film was that there was,0.07284528
way too much downside that ruins the overall flow of the pacing now look I,0.1495418
completely understand that these downside moments are meant to give the audience some time with,0.07377738
the characters as well as a break from the action scenes but some of these,0.06679054
Delta moments stretch on for far too long like the first act with Logan Charles,0.041814998
in this one mutant named Caliban living together in an abandoned smelting plant others just,0.12567091
don't really add much to the characters that they really explore or develop these characters,0.093807295
in these outside moments like a hotel scene with Charles Logan and Laura and then,0.078403965
others were completely ineffectual and superfluous to the entire story like that entire segment were,0.16511461
Logan Charles and Laura spend the night at farming families house what was the point,0.04795121
of having that effect that entire scene felt eerily similar to the scene and x-men,0.12294775
origins Wolverine hoovering say that mom potheads farming house and they end up buying the,0.2312102
dust a multitude of these scenes could have easily been trimmed or completely removed they,0.12870698
didn't need to be in the film the main antagonists work really that memorable nor,0.05399818
were they all that threatening not to mention that they're just the same recycled evil,0.2413494
corporation experimenting on mutants that we have seen of by the time and other x-men,0.18345188
/ wolverine films but I will give some credit to that one villain who constantly,0.17856322
wore shades in the film and had that metal hand he has a flair of,0.0074796523
coolness to look that made him pretty interesting but as the film went on he,0.07665661
was just relegated to mere henchman status boom and the last major problem I found,0.10718452
with Logan was I wish they gave us more bonding moments between Logan and Laura,0.038367435
and sure the film does give us a handful that were serviceable but not in,0.055655457
the truly drive home that they built a strong deep and powerful connection throughout the,0.027506057
entire film it was lacking to say the least now the next few points are,0.10634137
just mere nitpicks they're not cons against the film they don't detract from the film,0.14240451
but they did personally irritate me throughout one of the biggest ones is I wanted,0.23814356
more explanation as to what happened to the other x-men now it's heavily implied that,0.07078251
Charles had something to do with it but never explicitly told to us and I,0.05363667
personally believe that at this point it would be nice to kind of get an,0.066580534
explicit explanation as to what happened to all of our favorite x-men where are they,0.07819884
are they still around it they could have explained a little bit more of that,0.07696333
another significant and this is risk coming for me was the constant cussing throughout the,0.26661375
film now far be it for me to complain that a film has too much,0.104153
cussing in it I mean I cuss way more than I should in my own,0.4766672
videos and look I don't have a problem with excessive cursing in a film in,0.48656905
fact I prefer it and thoroughly enjoy it as long as it comes off natural,0.143074
the problem here in Logan is that many of these scenes are laced with profanity,0.13606524
come off as super force like they just have to throw in a and a,0.34065324
kid here because they got an R rating which I'm grateful for I'm thankful that,0.123155266
you finally gave us a or rated Wolverine film as they gave us some of,0.09923842
the best action we've ever seen a Wolverine film but just because you're all rated,0.07817214
doesn't mean that you have to cut every three to five seconds I mean as,0.1401284
long as you do it now and again that's perfectly fine in fact it would,0.07493077
be more effective also hearing Patrick Stewart's version of Charles Xavier cursing so much was,0.34114602
just so weird and unsettling now Logan I understand as he's always been a character,0.14159912
that's known to fly off the hinges you know go off the handle but with,0.083166644
Xavier I always saw him as a man of intelligence integrity and elegance who wouldn't,0.40000862
stoop to using such a vulgar and petty speech so to hear him cursing so,0.69542736
much in this film I didn't know how to feel I was kind of taken,0.10887666
aback like oh not not not wrong Xavier does all the characters that should never,0.08673838
cut in my presence it's Charles Xavier I don't like seeing Charles cussing so much,0.5724433
and look I understand that it fits the type of character that he is in,0.07996612
this film as he is losing his mind he is senile so of course he's,0.53490317
more prone to these petty outbursts but that doesn't mean it changes how I feel,0.18366218
about it I still can't see Charles Xavier cursing but overall guys despite a few,0.40845922
problems I still found Logan to be a super film that I thoroughly enjoyed watching,0.115791984
from beginning to end it is my second favorite Wolverine film after the Wolverine and,0.057927385
I thought it was an excellent send-off to an iconic character and an iconic role,0.16182016
portrayed by Hugh Jackman and he will sorely be missed but I am very thankful,0.082644664
that for his last film as Wolverine he made it one hell of a film,0.24501023
that I highly recommend that you all go see in fact I'll even need to,0.098707676
tell you guys to go see it because you already have seen it or bored,0.10182975
to see it regardless of what I think but as always guys I'm not the,0.069995575
