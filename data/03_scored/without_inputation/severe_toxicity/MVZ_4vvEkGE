hey everyone welcome back to my channel I'm Stef Koza and I have not posted,0.027975628
a video in a while so hello hi still alive it's summer it's time for,0.11220584
vacations and traveling and not sitting in this room all the time but summertime also,0.028860323
means an incredible amount of summer blockbusters so here we are about to review one,0.021190755
Mission Impossible fallout let's go so this is one of those movies where you see,0.036701508
the trailer and you're like do we need another Mission Impossible movie not really but,0.039243173
after seeing it I feel like I needed it I had so much fun watching,0.031060085
Mission Impossible fall out what I feel like the first thing that needs to be,0.030207984
addressed here is Tom Cruise 56 years old six the Mission Impossible film really action-packed,0.02821576
like heavy load of like stunts and practical effects and like difficult for a 56,0.06041131
year old man to be doing so a lot of people were like can he,0.10133474
still do this like is this is this gonna be okay or is this gonna,0.10590788
be like some weird crickety old frail man trying to like embrace his younger self,0.1191743
that he just can't find anymore but if you told me that this man was,0.03896712
56 years old I would not believe you just what he is just as incredible,0.05392045
if not more incredible then he's always been in all the Mission Impossible films I,0.044850674
don't really like Tom Cruise like nobody really likes Tom Cruise like let's be real,0.08318388
he's kind of a prick sorry Tom but I am so impressed by him like,0.3044508
he does 99% of his own stunts he wants them all to be practical he,0.09869529
doesn't like green screen so he will literally be hanging off the helicopter doing some,0.15951902
ridiculous stunts just because he wants to because he cares about the movie and he's,0.27464238
like this is what it has to be like I just I have to do,0.023751047
this sorry and it's so cool and it really shows in the movies you can,0.03743853
tell like this was a real stunt this this happened in real life and I,0.06470574
really do appreciate the hell out of that because not a lot of people do,0.19430014
that especially in this day and age he's badass enough at 56 years old to,0.2623627
be hanging off helicopters and climbing rocks and skydiving I can't even do that now,0.5530055
25 so mission impossible fallout is directed by the same drew after that did the,0.026286062
previous Mission Impossible movie this is like a direct sequel to the events that happened,0.04402651
there it's like the same characters the same villain so they're very closely related and,0.030162752
this movie is also very much like pretty much what you would expect we know,0.048610955
the format the formula of a Mission Impossible movie at this point there's some exposition,0.018282572
it's like okay now we get it and then once you get it it's just,0.06114102
a whirlwind of action sequences and just ridiculous like there's hardly any lines in like,0.22983392
the second and third acts it's just ridiculous amounts of incredible action but that's what,0.17742842
we signed up for when we go see Mission Impossible well you know that's what,0.026150364
we're getting into I would describe this movie like a roller coaster kind of ebbs,0.08648585
and flows there are lots of like really high intensity moments and then really low,0.016847106
kind of boring exposition moments but like the overarching plot of the movie like the,0.0439713
whole experience it's kind of like when you're going up a rollercoaster hill and it's,0.05451712
like the really big hill and you're just like slowly like working your way up,0.06370264
and it's just like and you have like this anticipation building but it's really slow,0.062378928
and you're just kind of looking around and you're like oh I can see my,0.05973216
car from here and then you finally get to the top and she's like and,0.030903768
that's the rest of the first act up the hill rest of the movie crazy,0.115374774
rollercoaster and it's really fun like I did not expect to have that much fun,0.043361325
in this movie I had so much fun like I'd have to point out this,0.05205195
is a three hour movie this movie was three hours long there was not one,0.04256244
moment where I realized it was three hours long like I walked out of the,0.024855252
theater and I said holy it's 11 o'clock how did this happen but it was,0.06482414
like really it was just so fun and so exciting and so many new things,0.041975085
kept happening as I cool ooh ooh what and it was just very exciting I,0.020792311
will say the villains villain villains were not super interesting I think some of that,0.05866321
has to do with the fact that the villain why does my microphone always die,0.23035014
every time every time hey whilst I never make a video without her microphone dying,0.37010154
halfway through we'll never know anyways what was I talking about what was I saying,0.04653625
villains I think the villain in this movie is Lane who was established in the,0.04740764
previous movie so there wasn't really any like we don't need to know much more,0.030726163
about him we kind of already know but that made it a little bit boring,0.12273636
because like he doesn't really say much of anything throughout the entire movie he's just,0.055227537
sort of there he's just kind of a problem and it's just more about them,0.07265535
solving this mission and solving this problem that he has created but he's not really,0.02977761
doing anything after he's created the problem if that makes sense so the the real,0.027145479
villain of this movie is just like the mission that they're trying to solve and,0.036560487
then there are obviously like some people who get in the way and like try,0.04119416
and stop them from solving this mission because you have to have a million car,0.046049997
chases and fight scenes and all that good stuff but I don't think any of,0.04722272
it is like strongly motivated by anything and that was one flaw that the movie,0.02915234
had was just kind of like face value it's a mission they need to solve,0.053189415
it save the people run from the bad guys very top-level average action movie stuff,0.08173378
but like I said this movie does have some incredible plot twists that I never,0.027402906
would have thought of there were so many things that happened that I did not,0.015238692
see coming at all and every time they happened I was just like oh like,0.046632033
everyone in the theater just starts screaming they're just like what's happening like really well-written,0.066097304
ideas and concepts and there's a lot of like sticky situations that they get into,0.077787906
and you're like I literally could not even think of a way to get out,0.096647196
of this like the writing is surprisingly impressive I think the dialogue is not very,0.029085156
good there are a lot of like kind of cheesy moments but I think that's,0.048892327
sort of part of the charm of Mission Impossible is it's like it's a shitty,0.5548485
action movie that's actually not that shitty it's like one of those blockbusters that's like,0.6059859
a pretty good blockbuster like I would definitely watch it again it was really fun,0.03427292
Ethan Hunt is still a really believable character even with Tom Cruise being 56 years,0.015327827
old like he really convinces you that he can do all of these things you,0.06518201
just kind of love him like I started the movie and I was a guy,0.06376517
I forgot how much I hate Tom Cruise but then I got like halfway through,0.16919744
the movie knows like I love you you're so great you're such a good character,0.026848143
it's just so cool and I mean there are a lot of moments in this,0.046755094
movie where you're like that would never happen that's just ridiculous like it's a little,0.24739759
bit believable like everything kind of like you could defend it with physics it's just,0.13009262
kind of like in an anomaly situation but like it could happen it's just very,0.057656787
unlikely that all of these things happen to this guy and like he was okay,0.16479592
but that's kind of the excitement of it's kind of funny like whenever something like,0.030289803
that happened like everyone in my theater would just laugh like you know it's not,0.05072491
a moment in the movie where you're supposed to laugh but it's just so ridiculous,0.25166845
that you can't help it and it was just made it kind of more fun,0.04440633
some people might consider that a flaw I consider it a charm I think Henry,0.060909536
cavils character was a little bit he had some good moments but in general not,0.03387514
super interesting probably could have done without him I mean he was crucial to a,0.030535255
few plot points so I get it I don't know I wasn't really blown away,0.05265727
by his presence I think Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames really stole the show I,0.12569377
love the two of them together Rebecca Ferguson was also a super badass I just,0.17269698
love to see a girl kicking ass just as hard as the rest of the,0.7992296
cast like yours are so invigorating to watch her work but yeah in general I,0.24606061
thoroughly enjoyed this movie way more than I thought I would it's a three hour,0.062486023
movie that doesn't feel like three hours and I would say mission impossible fallout is,0.011599473
the best action movie this year so far but that's just because we don't have,0.016690789
John wick yet zing I'm so excited okay yes mission impossible fallout I'm gonna give,0.06741237
it a four a four out of five surprisingly good really just came out of,0.04081966
left field I wasn't even excited to see it I was like I have to,0.034450527
go see Mission Impossible but I loved it I had so much fun if you're,0.05137546
