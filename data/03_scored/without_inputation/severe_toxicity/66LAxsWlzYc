hey everyone its Rihanna and welcome back to another video so today I am so,0.057668097
excited to be talking about giving mo de Torres new film the shape of water,0.058782943
which I was highly anticipating Gilliam auditorium is one of my favorite directors working today,0.014950003
he brings such new fresh creative ideas at to the film industry and they always,0.011479074
bring the original stories which is why I love him Gilliam Editora has never once,0.07763691
let me down as a director so let's see if the shape of water is,0.024693612
as good as his previous films once upon a time during the cold war a,0.07204271
mute woman named Eliza played by Sally Hawkins works in a scientific experimental facility and,0.089126624
one night they get a new asset in the facility and Eliza goes to investigate,0.017627366
and finds a c-like creature who is also very human-like in a pool tank now,0.1437994
Eliza finds a unique connection between her and the sea like creature the fact that,0.047456197
she can't speak in the fact that he can't speak gives her the much-needed communication,0.05108677
that she is craved for her whole life she's always felt alone as a human,0.14446858
and they start to form a friendship now the first thing that struck me about,0.06423546
the shape of water was at the world that Gilliam auditory sets his film in,0.0262089
obviously it's set during the Cold War there is tension between the Russians and the,0.078130476
Americans and it's a very fantastical world obviously we have a scene like creature living,0.34429687
in it and obviously in the real world we would not see that but also,0.034244318
the use of colors and music and just overall the whimsical atmosphere of the film,0.015388358
it definitely makes it otherworldly but also very much set in our time which is,0.014137813
what I've always loved about Gilliam Otara him setting fantastical stories in the real world,0.032702424
it's not such a complicated world that he has to build around it but it,0.046043348
is very very effective it's a very dark story but it's also filled with bright,0.05324396
colors and whimsical music the world is obviously helped out by the production's line and,0.037780434
at the cinematography and overall the aesthetic of this film is just beautiful the deep,0.0455112
greens and blues that used in this film are just gorgeous it is very pleasing,0.085892506
to look at I would expect nothing less from giving a model tour Oh since,0.030394236
he makes nothing but beautiful films so let's get down to the characters of the,0.12220488
film our main character is in woman named Eliza Sally Hawkins gives a fantastic performance,0.045934256
here she's strong and powerful and emotional just by using her actions obviously she can,0.043403234
use her voice in her acting which I found phenomenal I could really sympathize with,0.098395295
and relate to the character of a live out which just is incredible I really,0.011520316
am rooting for her in next year's Oscars because obviously she's mute there's a lot,0.054162577
of use of sign language in this film which I really really like it's very,0.047346443
rare to see the use of sign language in such a big production of filmic,0.072795704
but I thought it was really really effective considering her and this creature could communicate,0.061303325
through sign language Michael Shannon plays the bad guy mr. Strickland who is incredibly scary,0.10824733
he's very disturbing and creepy but if anyone can pull that off it's Michael Shannon,0.08548807
he has one of those very creepy faces so we have a powerful performance and,0.11504351
a scary performance but we also have some married comedic performances here especially from a,0.020769695
Tobias Spencer who plays the character of Zelda who is Eliza's work colleague she had,0.013388816
some of the best lines that she was just hilarious it's very reminiscent of her,0.074132055
role in the help her characters are very similar and another comedic performance was of,0.0072957342
Richard Jenkins as Eliza's neighbor Giles I thought he was great in the film I,0.02719936
really loved his character all of these characters were so well fleshed out that I,0.03500662
just think the writing for them is incredible and obviously as this sealant creature we,0.03709064
have Gilliam Editora alumni Doug Jones who always gives a fantastic performance even if he,0.032236796
is under a latex costume him and Sally Hawkins have this really strange connection and,0.05424839
they really bring it to the characters it's just fantastic I think the film looking,0.022432653
so beautiful wasn't enough the creatures line is something sent from the heavens above it,0.10583804
looks so real and realistic it is in competition with things like the Apes in,0.1330241
the Planet of the Apes trilogy I really do think Hollywood need to learn a,0.12623988
thing or two from Guillermo de Torres creature design because when he did the big-budget,0.047629144
blockbuster film Pacific Rim the design of the kaiju sand the jaegers were incredible and,0.04210679
let's just face it things like transformers pirates the Caribbean anything that involves a big,0.102314554
huge monster thing needs to step up the game if they want to compete with,0.11135108
Guillermo de Toro with any other Gillian motor Tori films this story is one the,0.040241614
bazaar it's quite light-hearted compared to his other films especially Pan's Labyrinth which I think,0.059347685
there's definitely a similarity between the two because it is set in the real world,0.04266887
in a real time but the shape of water just has something very whimsical about,0.019261723
it I keep using that word but it is very very true because the film,0.03018936
is light-hearted and funny but also incredibly dark I think the film kind of struggled,0.049595427
with its tone considering there are so many genres here we have fantasy comedy kind,0.051249076
of thriller horror elements in here at the end of the film somehow Gilliam auditoria,0.04662139
has worked his director magic and weave them together perfectly Gilliam auditorio I just am,0.015548668
so in or of him he is such a fantastic director he can do no,0.057729293
wrong in my eyes the shape of water is another fantastic film by him I,0.055141065
can't wait to see what he does next I seriously think this is Guillermo de,0.041318547
Torres best film it's since Pan's Labyrinth and I cannot wait to see it again,0.047852647
although I will not be seeing again till February next year because that's when it's,0.025741277
officially released in the UK oh that makes it sound like I illegally watched it,0.09209135
which I absolutely didn't I saw it at the BFI London Film Festival and people,0.028119974
clapped after and usually I would never clap after a film but I had to,0.020736435
clap for this it's definitely a cinematic experience Gillian wonder toy fans are going to,0.07624468
