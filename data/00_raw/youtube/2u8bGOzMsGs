not only one but two of them y'all go hand shot this video really quick and I'm gonna come back with the rest of the review look at this present that I got from the movie theater they were so happy about my premiere and how everything turned out my Black Panther meet-and-greet that they contacted Marvel and asked them to let me keep these shades as presents these things are 60 by 80 they are huge the boys are holding them for me right now on the couch flip them over flip them over like tell me this isn't dope oh my gosh look at that look at claw I can't wait to put these up when I do my review oh my god Thank You Marvel this is like the best gift Marvel could have gave me like I'm so happy right now tell me I'm the only one bouncing in the theater tell me how I'm doing this too and they got started early yes oh my god this movie was the bomb first of all before we get started has anybody seen dam Tyler Perry okay it's Tyler Perry all right cuz rumor has it his asses in the damn lab with a pen and a pad right and Madea Goes to Wakanda I know Tyler Perry is sick right now because when I tell you Marvel's Black Panther has broken just crazy records and I'm just so proud of not only the cast the people behind the scenes ryan coogler for writing and directing this I mean it's just so much to talk about y'all honey let's go ahead and get started okay not only did Black Panther break records they made 218 million dollars over the weekend that was just in the United States they made over 300 million globally and on top of those numbers this is also one of the largest openers for a black director so once again kudos to Ryan Coogler he did his thing he was just a young man from Oakland who had a damn dream and you know many people would have crumbled under the pressure of having to direct such a major film especially being that all eyes were on him the fact that he was able to write and direct this I can't do nothing but just give him props all I can say that I'm really really proud of Ryan Coogler like I said for not only writing and directing you know watching this film not only as a Marvel fan but as somebody who's involved behind the scenes in the industry who's into camera and you know who wants to get into directing who wants to get into shooting more films and stuff like that I'm just really really proud of him and what he brought to the forefront the hashtag Black Panther is one of the most tweeted movies ever okay they broke all types of records online people were hash tagging Black Panther soul it will kind of forever they created so many hashtags that they have literally broken Twitter and just to go through and see all the pictures of people posting at their different events and the outfits I saw folks going into the movie theaters with drums down in Atlanta I mean folks were showing out for this movie like you just felt like almost like a global connection with so many people with people of all races ethnicities not only was this movie well casted but I love the fact that it bought so many different black people together globally you had people who were full African raised on the continent Africa you had people who were full African but there were raised here in America you also had a lot of African Americans in the cast you also had some Caribbeans in the cast you also have black people who are from London who are part of the cast so this was definitely a global casting everybody could see themselves in each and every character and their backstories so I really love that about the overall casting even now let's start with Wakanda so we were all excited to go to Wakanda and to check it out and to see how it turned out and I just thought that the whole futuristic feel of it was just really really dope so I have to give props to the production design on Bleacher her and her team they really worked hard to bring Wakanda to life it definitely gave you a afro-futurist paradise you know I'm saying a lot of people are really excited to just see it and this is probably one of the best Marvel Worlds I've ever seen come on to screen the way that they had it mixed with some of the African culture and the waterfall scene and then you had the spaceships who had the technology because after all kinda is the most you know technologically advanced place on the planet so they definitely woven lot of that into it I mean the people who did like the animation the CG I just a lot of the stuff that was just going on to make what kinda in the background what it was was just crazy it was just amazing to watch it and when we watched it in 3d I don't know if you guys caught it in 3d it felt like you were literally in there walking around like things were just coming at you it was insane so I have to give them props on how they brought what kind of to life I mean literally to take you know what was written by Stanley in a comic book and then have it for like you know future generations to see this and to like literally walk through Wakanda and be right there next to Charla and everybody else it was amazing so I definitely had to give them props for their hard work their team did the damn thing with bringing what kind of to the screen there was a lot of black excellence in this film I mean there was a lot of comedic relief as well so I thought it was gonna be more serious but I love the fact that they threw in some of that humor that modern-day humor when Sheree looked at childless sandals and she was like what are those when I tell you the entire audience was cracking up you know I love that they had some comic relief I love the handshape because that's something that me and my siblings do you know I'm saying I just love the fact that even though he's a prince and you know she's like you know the princes sister they were just at the end of the day siblings who had love for each other you know they just had a genuine connection and I just love that like I said before the waterfalls seemed to me was off the chain the dancing and the shaking and everything else like I felt like you know that was part of my culture I felt like I was like at a Nigerian gathering so I love how they makes part of African culture along with African American culture in there and the references even the fact that the back story was set in Oakland to me was just really really cool as well and to see like you know the african-american kids out there playing basketball like it was just like everything just flowed together really well it was a lot of black excellence in this film you also got a feel of the pan-africanism that was running through the film which was directly from ryan coogler that's why i'm so glad that they had a black african-american director who could kind of insert that into the film and i don't think that that would have been inserted had it been anybody else so i definitely love the fact that you know that he put that in there and you felt that and then you also felt like you know the pride of the african people as well in the film so like I was saying before I love Sri to me she is one of the breakout stars in this movie Leticia Wright did her thing you know I'm saying and that's who I was so excited to see when I was talking about it in my interview before you went to go see the movie because she's the smartest girl in the world she's the young sister she's an IT tech so for me I've always kind of felt connected her because so many times you know they tell girls you know you're not supposed to be into computers and comic books and you know themes that are techy and she just naturally had the gift for that and it just naturally came to her I just love how she was able to basically create these suits and she was like you know what the old ones are outdated you know I'm updating everything and that scene when chili kicked the suit and it went flying and she goes running over there like don't be kicking my inventions and all that stuff like that was just so cute like I got Jubilee tees from Surrey and for Yahoo Donohue Jubilee is she's like the young teenager in the x-men and that's what Surrey kind of reminded me of she had like that young teenage feel you know she's still trying to figure herself out but she knows what she wants she knows that she's really into technology but at the end the day she's just his little sister she's just a young girl so I would not be surprised at all if Marvel ends up doing like the animated series around Surrey because I think a lot of young people can really relate to her character so I love the fact that you know there was that age division but that didn't slow her down she didn't use that as an excuse you know for why she couldn't do the things that she was doing so she definitely reminded me of Jubilee as far as you know just trying to figure out life and you know trying to figure out her powers and I was trying to put her best foot forward and then even being so excited to finally go like on this whole you know fighting spree with her brother and her coy yay so now let's talk about the dorm Elijah's I love the women in this film and the fact that it was the women who are the protectors and the warriors I thought that was dope Danny Guerrero the way she bought Okoye yet to life to me was just amazing her passion her fierceness and her fighting scenes was sick when she snatched off her damn wig honey and through that [ __ ] and got the fighting I was like yeah I mean everybody went crazy in the theater that was so funny and then when she was car surfing on the hood of the car I thought that scene was crazy I mean the graphics in that film was just insane but I definitely loved her character and I also loved that she was able to bring that soft side acordes loyalty to the throne of Wakanda and the people like her loyalty and her devotion was just really amazing and the fact that you can see that her and Wahhabi they had like this you know they kind of had like this love connection a little bit but she didn't let that blind her and she was ready to take his ass out if he was gonna stand in her way and I love the fact that at the end you know when they did that whole little rhino scene when he was charging at her and the Rhino stopped and then you know like just licked her they just let you know that as hard as her exterior was and as tough as she was and as tough as she's ready to give her life for the king she still had that femininity about her she still had that southside that even though rhino was able to pick up on that that the rhinos stopped dead in his tracks and then licked her face I love that scene and then when what kabhi jumped off of the Rhino and they just had like that intense moment and then basically she told him you know drop down your weapons and when he looked around he saw everybody fighting he saw this conflict then he decided to drop his weapon I thought that was powerful you know showed that yes she was strong as a woman but it was done in a way that didn't do Maskull ate him you know I'm saying they still at the end stood together side by side so I really love that dynamic about that I really loved how they made the dorm Elisha's you know how they were these powerful women but they still had that soft side they still had that caring side you know they were even scenes where she kind of broke down crying so I thought that the scenes with the normalize days and especially with oak oye which is really remedy and so I definitely enjoyed that okay so Lupita Nyong'o played the character of Nakia and I thought that she did a wonderful job she looked beautiful in that film and I think the thing I love the most about Nikita's character is the fact that she was a dark-skinned African woman and she was a love interest she's who captured Charlie's heart Chawla was really in love with her and wanted her to settle down and be a queen but she felt like you know what you know I'm bigger than this I'm bigger than just sitting on the throne I want to be out here helping people and saving people so I definitely loved the dynamic of her character and you know how much he was like willing to fight for Charla especially after you know pill and monger came to power she's like we have to overthrow him you know he killed a child she realized in the end that she really had a lot of love for him so I definitely loved like what her overall character brought to the screen I thought she did a really awesome job as Nakia so now honey we got to talk about in Baku um hey Exedy how're you doing I got a citizen tea on this one okay first of all Baku aka Winston Duke that's who played in Baku to me he was another breakout star in the scene this man is from Tobago but he was raised in America when I tell you that he was looking good as hell honey every time I heard that I was so excited to see him I mean at first he was the villain he was trying to challenge chala and I'm like you know what you need to go sit down but he ended up being you know a vital part of the movie and the fact that instead of him letting his jealousy and his angst get to him he showed that he was a better man when he saved child's life and he put him in that little ice box you know I'm saying so I really respected him for that because he could have been like you know what oh well you know he beat me in the last scene so I'm gonna go ahead and let him die but he didn't he showed that at the end of it it was about a brotherhood and the fact that you know there are two African people trying to leave their tribes that they have to stand with each other so he was definitely a breakout starting me he was also funny when he was time I eaten that white man the white dude was all scared he was like now I'm a vegetarian so like this I'm saying there's like a lot of comic relief in this movie and I just love that honey mbaku hey I'm gonna need to see him in some more roles okay I'm gonna need to see him come back he needs to be a part of this whole Marvel Universe I want something just dedicated to mbaku cuz his ass was fine as hell he made them scenes honey every time I heard that my got a little bit excited okay so anyways on to the next character another character that I really loved in this movie was Ulysses Klaw I thought his character was so funny he was crazy he was kind of psycho but then he also gave that comedic relief when he was like baby don't hurt me don't hurt me no more like I was falling out in the movie like this dude is a mess and then the fact that he was like the only person the only outsider to ever go see what kinda make it out alive I thought his character brought a lot to the movie you know he was definitely funny he was a good fighter and then the fact that you know he ended up getting played by air kill monger that was insane so now let's go on to air kill monger okay when I tell you Michael B Jordan he played the hell out this role uh you know it's hard to even describe like night understand what black nerd meant when he said that there's a message in this movie like he left me just speechless at the end of everything you know I'm saying you know the fact that he went through our bag he got trained by the US military you know yes he was a bloodthirsty villain but it's like he had a reason for his thirst and the fact that he was trying to avenge his father's death and then also help not only you know Africans but free african-americans and black people throughout the disparate you know he was that character where initially you wanted to hate him but you ended up having a lot of love and respect for him in the end and Michael B Jordan like I mean just the fact that he had this danghang Oakland accent and he was himself he wasn't trying to be a part of the Africans per se he wasn't trying to necessarily mix into their culture he wanted things his way and he came to overthrow chala and he damn near almost succeeded you know I'm saying so in my personal opinion I definitely feel like he'll monger is probably one of the best Marvel villains I've seen to date he put so much work and so into the character of kill monger that I couldn't do nothing but give him props I mean not only was his body on point honey okay I mean you know from a female not only was his body on point he was out buff and you know the muscles was popping and everything else but besides that the way he acted it out like he believed that role he was Ehrich kill monger Michael B Jordan is so good and he's been in the game a long time to see Michael B Jordan go from being a little kid in the wire and then he was in one of my favorite movies Chronicles well he was flying and doing all that stuff and then a seaman Creed and then not to see him bring this role era kill monger to life I can't do nothing but give him props he did the damn thing and I love the fact that he called out charla for you know basically almost being selfish like you guys are in this secret world you guys have all this technology you guys have things that can help free black people throughout the Despero and instead of y'all doing that you guys are harvesting all of this to yourself you're a selfish king like he called him out on that because even Lupita's character Nakia was saying the same thing and but I understood where child was coming from like he didn't want his people in slave he didn't want his people you know to get hurt and killed and everything else they had been living in his secret land for you know for centuries so I definitely understood both parts but the character of kill monger he stood by his convey shinsen he was ready to die for those convictions in the final line that he set in the movie I think about a lot of people to tears it moved a lot of people when he said bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from the ships because they knew death was better than bondage when I tell you like just that line that hit home with a lot of people I don't care if you're African I don't care if you're african-american I don't care from the Caribbeans you know we talk about this all the time on this channel you know how slavery just did a number on black people globally so I definitely loved what he had to say in that moment and I think those words struck a chord with a lot of people I know a lot of people told me on social media they cried when they heard Michael B Jordan say those words he brought a lot of excitement to the film he was definitely unapologetic and I got a lot of magneto T's from him okay he kind of reminded me a little bit of magneto because magneto in the x-men he didn't give a damn about the humans he was about trying to save his people because of what the humans were doing to the mutants you know I'm saying and he was willing to save them by any means necessary so I got that Malcolm X vibe for Magneto as I did from kill monger you know I'm saying he was passionate and he was gonna stand by his convictions and you know nothing could keep him from his convictions but death so I definitely respected that whereas Charla was more like a Professor Xavier he was more about you know peace and not really wanting to like test the waters and sometimes as a king you have to balance that out you know I'm saying do you risk you know exposing your people do you risk you know putting your people in harm's way just to say people that you don't necessarily know so I definitely understand both parts and I'm just really glad that ryan coogler but those two dynamics to the forefront because those are things that we go through as black people around the world you know just the inner conflict you know being proud of your blackness and you know representing your blackness but then knowing that sometimes you have to kind of fall back depending on the situation so I definitely understood that you know that fine balance that both of these guys brought to the film so to end this review I really love the movie I love what Chadwick Boseman back to his character you know you had some people saying oh you know he was selling out he was cooling in the job watched the entire movie did you get up as soon as you saw the you know the damn credits rolling you know there's extra scenes at the end that's why I had to watch this movie twice because I didn't get to see it the first time during my meet-and-greet so I went back on Sunday and I rewatched the movie again because I loved it the first time but I want to make sure I saw everything but at the end he did go and speak to the United Nations and when he said the Y's build bridges while the foolish build barriers I love that part and I don't know if that was a reference honey towards you know Donald Trump I'm not sure but I love the fact that he said that and it shows that you know he's trying to make a change and that everything that Eric kil monger said to him really struck a chord with him and that he wanted to start doing better and helping people of color all around the world so all in all I really enjoyed the movie I loved it I mean the characters were super dynamic it was well-written ryan coogler did an awesome job everyone who worked on this movie did a great job and you know props to them everybody from the animators to the editors so there you know the grips and the graphics it takes a whole community to make something like this come together so thank you guys and thank you for Marvel for putting this together and thank you to Marvel for giving me this cool shade behind me so I cannot wait to see Black Panther - I cannot wait to see what you know they end up doing with child's character and all these other Marvel movies like you know Captain America and you know infinity wars I cannot wait to see like where they take his character because again I think it's very important for us to see superheroes and characters like this who look like us you know I'm saying we need children to see that you know black people can be superheroes and can't have superpowers and you know they can use their imagination as well just like other races of children so I'm really glad that they put a lot into this movie they put their money where their mouth is it was nothing but positive vibes so let's go ahead and get the discussion poppin let me know your thoughts you know how did you feel about the movie were you able to cop a ticket because I know so many theaters were sold out around the country so did you get to see it opening night did you have to wait until Sunday and then how are people dressed at the theater when you guys want to go see it we're people in African garb where they just dress regularly where they dress like the Black Panther Party like we had a ball at our theater so let's go ahead and get the discussion pop and let me know your thoughts on the Black Panther movie
