trailers review of Mad Max fury road oh what a day what a lovely day,0.18134339
wanna get through this it would seem that the only thing standing between George Miller,0.09488157
and cinematic glory is 150 million dollars yes that's the budget for Mad Max fury,0.15879838
road and if Miller delivers he'll provide a strong argument that Studios should have more,0.058392543
faith in creative talent and let them loose with hundreds of millions of dollars to,0.10147873
play with then again while Miller isn't a sure bet he's still a solid bet,0.08821324
the creator of the original Mad Max trilogy Miller has since impressed with The Witches,0.28130496

Plus for a while all the shooting locations Miller had in mind were considered a,0.09502843
security risk but while animated films aimed at adult audiences are quite popular in Asia,0.06650077
perhaps Miller felt fury road was risky enough without the added hurdle of trying to,0.07197587
convince Western audiences that animation could evolve beyond family entertainment too bad especially because Mad,0.3396458
Max fury road might be a tough sell even as a live-action film emulating the,0.070244
work of legendary mainstream photographer Pete Ehrlich whose galleries are a Vegas staple Miller's fourth,0.08400842

and further complicating matters is Gibson's replacement tom hardy Hardy signed onto the film just,0.08856673
as he was becoming a household name thanks to inception in the Dark Knight Rises,0.0670869
but then that star power never materialized but Warner Brothers still has high hopes for,0.061033398
Mad Max fury road not only making it a focal point during their last comic-con,0.2635577
presentation but citing Hardy for three more movies that's right these days Hollywood finds itself,0.10444619
in the movie version of an arm race with each studio trying to lay claim,0.1327038
to as many franchises as they can but while Warner Brothers wants Mad Max to,0.15910842
compete as a blockbuster meaning a movie that's commercially viable our Mad Max movies commercially,0.12572515
viable George Miller just did a major solid for artistic filmmakers everywhere I mean this,0.07763935
movie isn't just great it's like AFI top 100 films of all time great it's,0.065009214
so grotesque both visually and emotionally that it becomes something beautiful and straight up as,0.36080635
this movie demonstrates if the apocalypse ever does come and you're not a white dude,0.6329093
run for your nlgger life however to be honest the civilized world isn't much better,0.69542736
and I think a lot of people trying to make their way in this world,0.09041302
regardless of ethnicity or gender will be able to relate to Mad Max fury road,0.14021051
I certainly did but then some people will not and I say that because at,0.12749867
the end of the film there's a quote that comes up on the screen and,0.05441766
at the press screening I attended when that quote came up some people laughed at,0.07014777
it dismissing Lee which was unfortunate because it was both unimportant and brilliant waked and,0.18056446
the movie and we'll discuss that in my spoiler review but here I will say,0.08173525
that it makes me a tiny bit worried about the box-office prospects for Mad Max,0.1688204
fury road because it's definitely a blockbuster with a high art sensibility and there's a,0.08890145
reason that high art depends on a few buyers with deep pockets rather than mass,0.083828695
appeal but then again Apocalypse Now was a very big set of commercially so maybe,0.09975964
there is hope for Mad Max fury road and yes I did just compare Mad,0.28566632
Max fury road to Apocalypse Now I would say by way of Cirque du Soleil,0.15066388
and I mean that I mean that the Cirque du Soleil aspect in a positive,0.11156294
way however if you don't appreciate Cirque du Soleil well let's just say that at,0.15525636
the press screening I attended there were two types of people in the audience those,0.049220804
that applauded the movie and those that laughed at the movie and I'm not just,0.06833729
talking at the end of the movie I'm talking during the actual film that's how,0.09719657
engaged people work even if it was sometimes in a negative manner people laughter applauded,0.12981763
after scenes and action set-pieces also speaking of watching this movie you must must must,0.12168147
must must must must see it in 3d seriously if you don't see Mad Max,0.31089434
fury road in 3d then you are not seeing it as it was intended to,0.15388836
be seen and the 3d is spectacular now I'll go into details in my spoiler,0.0628608
review but here I want to just go over some broad strokes first off the,0.08626734
world-building in this movie is amazing not just in its attention to detail but its,0.06117276
realism how well it's thought-out George Miller has done a fantastic job you know realizing,0.11092196
the infrastructure of this you know post-apocalyptic situation that he's created and also its military,0.13416632
prowess I mean it's really really impressive and I think some credit goes to his,0.079956606
screenwriter who is a UK comic-book writer and I think that you can definitely see,0.13036436
that DNA in the film both UK comics which are pretty distinct and also the,0.022119705
post-apocalyptic genre and comics which actually the UK tends to specialise in so that's very,0.08760925
impressive now as for the actors we're going to discuss here are two leads and,0.07337823
we'll discuss everybody else in the spoiler review now Charlize Theron Wow if Tom Hardy,0.080258876
wasn't so good-looking this would 100% be her movie she is amazing what a fantastic,0.1517619
role not just for a woman but anyone and she nails it watching this movie,0.1667552
I was said that she's not Wonder Woman I mean gal gadot really has the,0.41854325
bar raised substantially by Mad Max fury road and Charlize Theron performance but maybe she'll,0.19310342
be Captain Marvel or somebody if some studio doesn't snap her up after this for,0.18450624
some kind of franchise it'll be I think they will but it would be a,0.051283896
major missed opportunity this should be the film that makes Charlize Theron finally an action,0.033908144
star she's been trying for a while with Aeon Flux and Prometheus but this is,0.09754307
her moment this is it she is just spectacular and then Tom Hardy is very,0.102691606
good and it's so nice to see his face he often hi he hides it,0.40026957
for a good deal of this film actually so when it does come back it,0.08892124
really makes an impression and not just because he's good-looking but because it's a powerful,0.08436402
acting tool for him I mean he has a very rich a rich and expressive,0.19218281
face and he shouldn't hide it all the time and speaking of hiding things you,0.10368932
get the feeling that Tom Hardy is almost afraid to let loose with his full,0.12418509
acting prowess which is weird I don't understand why he does that and you know,0.15789169
you could argue that Mad Max is holding back but I think it's more than,0.31089434
that you get the feeling that like Tom Hardy is afraid of his own acting,0.117418095
ability and I don't understand it I think it's weird I wish someone would say,0.18825686
unleash your inner acting beasts Tom Hardy don't be afraid you know your inner movie,0.5072456
star even I mean he's clearly a movie star I would say the he and,0.18514694
Ryan Gosling actually have the same problem and they could start some kind of support,0.07377923
group for guys who should be at the top of Hollywood but for some reason,0.07573809
I keep tripping themselves up and now I want to end my review coming back,0.31089434
to George Miller because it's just so wonderful to see a filmmaker who's paid his,0.16460665
dues I mean he started out with Mad Max but then he went to Hollywood,0.15682332
and he was a part of the Hollywood machine he made his big you know,0.07378171
solidly commercial successes you know he put always his own twist on it but you,0.13981897
know he had his happy feet as we discussed in the opening he produced the,0.057679575
babe and movies he directed this the sequel witches of eastwick he did all that,0.35575253
and he was able to pay his dues come full circle just like we're coming,0.07154163
back to him in this review and finally take his place as his rightful place,0.24013796
obviously based on this film as one of the great filmmakers of all time it's,0.09214866
just such a wonder to behold and it's just it's like seeing a butterfly emerge,0.09275095
from its cocoon it's just like wow now let's see if he can do it,0.10057244
again all right so that's my non-spoiler review of Mad Max fury road my spoiler,0.16619128
review will go up later today I hope you'll check that out you know once,0.15284601
you've seen the film or if you can't help yourself you might be like me,0.11649437
