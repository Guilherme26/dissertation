Katelyn Deaver stars in book-smart where she does her best to break out of her character as smart and responsible Eve Baxter by playing somebody who is smart and responsible except with a terrible mouth,0.40835753
its Olivia Wilde's feature-length directorial debut so how does she do with this high school drama tea,0.17734043
so it's the day before graduation and the two top students in the school who happen to be best friends realize that they have missed out on all kinds of parties and really just high school social life because they focused so much on their schoolwork in order to get into the top schools then they realize though that their friends well their acquaintances their classmates who did party who did have a lot of high school experiences also got into those exact same top schools,0.064319186
so they set out on the night before graduation to find an epic party so that they can kind of cram all of these experiences into one night before they graduate all of the characters seem to be kind of caricatures of real-life,0.10773001
I mean they are all just taken kind of to the extreme and really exaggerated,0.17465553
I mean like the jock is all jock the skater is kind of just dumb and brainless and a little bit clueless the the stoner is well there's stoned out of their minds,0.7686363
and even the gay guys are just wildly an overly flamboyant and just it was a little off-putting to see all of these characters who are just such extremes of anything based in reality,0.63460076
I mean yes you do have all of these people on all of those as examples in real life,0.27016038
but typically you don't have all of them to such a degree in one small little microcosm so to see them all put into that situation it did feel just a little bit forced like it didn't feel or ring true,0.10612539
so along with Kaitlyn Dever we have beanie Feldstein and together,0.07782094
they're kind of good I mean they they for the most part bring out the best in each other,0.109128855
I mean they really work hard as best friends to complement each other to lift each other up,0.16417722
and I appreciated that a lot but on the other hand they're also super crude together,0.0804442
and that began to really great on me just it it became wildly unnecessary and like that they were just trying to be crude for Croods,0.18364789
sake,0.061981987
now I'm not a prude or even disillusioned that there aren't crude people out there and that that's not how real life is however in this scenario it felt forced,0.16522029
it felt almost like that's how it should be that everybody should be crude or that they should be acting like this,0.09324297
versus it kind of being in the minority,0.09712155
I mean I volunteer with middle schoolers and high schoolers and for the most part they don't act,0.14950337
this way I mean sure there are some that do and and we all have our periods of you know acting out or whatever,0.07901021
but this in this instance in the film it just it felt like it was trying to tell us,0.037769116
no,0.06626663
no,0.06626663
this is how you're supposed to be versus,0.13921367
hey,0.048055597
that's kind of an anomaly or a little blip on the screen the pace of the film is is pretty good,0.079688914
I mean it moves along and it keeps the story going for the most part right up until about the beginning of the third act and then it just kind of steps on the brakes for a minute and it slows way down,0.049043145
and then after that it picks back up again,0.052623294
so you know I had a minor pacing issue there just because you start to feel the time just a tiny bit but for the most part throughout the film you don't notice the time moving along,0.061743025
I like some of the interactions between the characters and I also really like that some of the assumptions that are placed on the characters at the beginning of the film or that we are told to have assumptions as an audience,0.038633488
they turn out to be wrong,0.13608387
and then also that we see growth in some of the characters I really like that I really appreciate that fact because have the characters all stayed flat throughout the entire thing then it's just kind of pointless,0.19486375
I mean there's no reason to watch because it's just you're just watching a day in the life of somebody where they don't learn anything,0.19101688
and to me that's just kind of a waste of time,0.4165289
but they thankfully didn't do that with all of the characters,0.06423877
I mean you actually saw growth,0.11171021
you saw change you saw repentance or remorse or just you know them working on relationships and that was awesome,0.09071281
there are some genuinely funny moments in the film and some parts where I laughed out loud but I think they're kind of few and far between that most of the time when there was humor sometimes it felt forced or it just wasn't funny,0.06456825
well you can probably get a little bit of enjoyment from book-smart,0.24861299
I don't think it's memorable and it's certainly not that funny and really I don't think it's worth the time or the money certainly to rush right out and just drop all of your cash on it in the theater,0.09775886
check it out on Netflix wait for it for red box absolutely because then you're not out a ton of cash,0.10047989
I mean there are some redeeming points in the movie but overall it was just kind of there,0.05030961
there's no violence but there is sex nudity and a ton of profanity I give book-smart two and a half out of five couches,0.53490317
what is a really good high school comedy or drama that I should check out,0.07300253
