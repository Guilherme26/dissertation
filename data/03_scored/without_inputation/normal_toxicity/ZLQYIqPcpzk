is exactly how he wants to tell me stories exactly how he sees the world,0.055931862
and it's a really fascinating personal look at a point in time and the film,0.053944305
is so detailed and specific it's so clearly about one single point in history so,0.037508734
the film was set in the early nineteen seventies embezzling just follows a few months,0.04329085
in the life of a maid who worked for a middle-class family and that basically,0.11578015
is the extent of along with about the fact that there is of events you've,0.06120932
been it basically over Volga probably it's just a story this may live in this,0.069910936
humble life working for this family and there's all sorts of little and interesting things,0.063497245
that Colin brings to the film he makes sure to imbue it with a real,0.04448215
personal sense of history it feels like a nostalgic dream like something that he reimagines,0.17062579
from his youth the whole thing about Verma is that the whole thing was really,0.060217243
crowded there's a lot of characters a lot of movement and the film is constantly,0.05458655
filled with people hustling and bustling around but the film manages to make us focus,0.07253007
on the side poetry on the person who is just the servant it makes us,0.104370125
care about the people on the side the fingers on the side it make us,0.12280859
care about the little details in the big crowds and Cole makes an effort to,0.051753152
make this film about the little people that I'm present at like big events if,0.06881312
over ideas in Burma there's also this idea to do with women who are abandoned,0.15003367
by men and having to grieve together grieve in a war where there's no time,0.25070724
to grieve because they have to work there's also this whole thing about struggle about,0.07699065
people struggling to find where they are and in the end Roma isn't even really,0.0879969
a cohesive story it doesn't even have a real ending it just has an end,0.11132509
point where they could I felt that there is no concrete ending to the themes,0.07388258
struggle store go on work store goes on just a scrapbook and a few months,0.09375861
in the life of the character it's nothing more than just a collection of moment,0.113468215
the collection of memories it's not this great big expansive thing that has a concrete,0.0939371
ending it's not oh this is the end point of even that this fells be,0.44075415
leading to not particularly it's just an emotional numbing continuation of everything that's come before,0.13502549
and it will continue after the credits at World one thing the phone-- constantly reminds,0.05330639
us is that the world is bigger than these characters even though they are small,0.14892489
characters in relatively big events those events are still themselves contain between the time and,0.05924804
the setting but we see Coulter do things like plans in the sky and we,0.075821474
have shot with your expansive we see that with most of the world outside the,0.4405114
story and yet it is all self-contained the you thing had to say is that,0.101963766
this is such a technically impressive film was there's no denying that I feel like,0.053395048
children the men had innovative long takes and the governor was a fantastic use of,0.15162532
visual effects I think Burma is probably quads most technically impressive work the when he,0.06526096
manages to execute sermon in logistical challenging and technically difficult long tape filled with hundreds,0.27917948
of people in stark black-and-white it is amazing that was so shocked to me but,0.3374755
I really don't know how he managed to do them I also want to mention,0.10825767
the sound design which is amazing this film is so incredibly cinematic and the sound,0.121193446
is like this big mesh of noise because the phone constantly thought of crowd we,0.098515
hear all sorts of sounds we hear the hustle and bustle of the city is,0.065669775
so many scenes and he really makes the film come alive the technical aspects of,0.065254316
this film are incredible and to send it to the film in black and white,0.010949456
about a pretty insignificant story it is incredibly cinematic I've also that vomit leaves me,0.40336046
a little cold a little bit although that really did when I watched it because,0.103145875
it felt like a technically impressive showcase where the emotions were muted and I was,0.04997684
expecting to feel more but then after the first hour and a bit I really,0.06551425
began to feel more and by the end I was moved and afterwards I can't,0.042770825
think of the film without being moved by why we ultimately took me on the,0.082706146
journey and so even emotionally it's a film which is complex in the film which,0.05902922
seems distancing but it's actually not and so well not just works in every conceivable,0.088738166
way it's a real masterpiece a technical marvel and a really moving story that draws,0.046731
on themes and ideas that are fascinating it's really personal it's really really amazing and,0.05166689
