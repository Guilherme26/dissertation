now the Irishman is supposed to be Netflix's movie right it's three and a half,0.043041375
hours long it has a hundred and sixty million dollar budget it has fancy new,0.056704246
D aging VFX front and center in a year where that's all the rage right,0.09267338
some of Hollywood's most legendary talent and a sophisticated debut at the New York Film,0.016895665
Festival in fact they even had the press screening at Alice Tully Hall where the,0.009209468
film will debut this evening and they hardly ever do that for press they cram,0.047290567
us into the wall to read so that was that was real nice and because,0.03037029
I think they wanted everyone including the critics to feel that this is a movie,0.015929153
Scorsese lobbied hard but failed to get it a theatrical wide release but the theater,0.09061797
owners still really hate Netflix because they won't do at least like a two-month window,0.11893151
before digital release I think this is only gonna be like two weeks right theaters,0.03806181
before you can watch it on streaming but Netflix is rumored to have actually bought,0.022267688
the Paris theater here in New York City a prestige venue for this very movie,0.018337118
but ironically I think this is actually better suited for streaming and I think that's,0.04221455
actually the case with Romo as well both are a long slog like wow like,0.04812271
remember how a lot of you wrote me and said like I had a hard,0.09464698
time getting through Romo Grace and I felt at the end it was worth it,0.039137412
some of you agreed with me some of you didn't some of you never made,0.051934212
it to the end of Romo and I think it's a similar situation with the,0.05229408
Irishman now I think that because this is an English it's in color right and,0.04795575
it has Hollywood actors with the more commercial storytelling and performances it'll probably be better,0.02564682
received by audiences overall than Romo was right I think more people will get to,0.036572464
the end of this movie now as for award season I don't know I think,0.03111729
that its strongest bet is a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Joe Pesci who is,0.020174354
wonderfully understated here I was really impressed with his work it's in stark contrast to,0.032293335
his other iconic Scorsese performance in good which he already want an Oscar for so,0.03405474
I don't know if he's gonna win an Oscar here again for the same director,0.04962669
but I'm very maybe because it's such a different role he could and also Pesci,0.036606386
was uh nominated for Scorsese's Raging Bull so there's a very not only is there,0.048713394
are good awards history there voters love that kind of stuff but it's a very,0.016716065
good actor director collaboration indeed Scorsese actually looks after a number of actors but this,0.020582778
you know maybe this being just so different than Pesci's iconic persona right it was,0.03193613
funny in fact to sometimes watch them cuz it's so long and someone sometimes it's,0.059156112
not that good we're gonna talk about that sometimes it's very good but in some,0.0399649
of the slower moments I was like it's so funny that's Harry from home alone,0.020075243
hilarious he's Joe Pesci favorite character in the movie he's so adorable well they you,0.050387662
know but it towards the end when he was like a grandpa's I was this,0.07565133
one to go the whole movie I wanted to scope and give him a hug,0.03191019
he was so awesome and he had like a cool look he actually had glasses,0.04008197
a little bit like my new glasses maybe that maybe that's why I felt a,0.04414092
kinship with him alright so obviously the big question is how successful is the D,0.033837892
aging VFX right which is supposedly responsible for the sky-high budget although I think a,0.02238343
lot of people got paid big time here talk about the mob to do it,0.03582413
this on Netflix although you know nobody else really wanted to foot the budget right,0.07954865
I believe that was the that was a situation although seeing the movie I wouldn't,0.0150018865
paid one hundred and sixty million dollars for this either as speaking of the aging,0.03638355
as I said in my trailer reaction for this movie I find it ironic that,0.03190487
if this technology existed back in the 1970s DeNiro never would have gotten his big,0.040302146
breakout role as young Vito Corleone Marlon Brando just would have played the role himself,0.028708661
although I don't know Marlon Brando would have gone along with this he'd be like,0.04513936
no thank you especially maybe after he saw how it turned out when they showed,0.03917599
him the test he'd be like it doesn't even work I don't really think that,0.036958933
it does in some shots it does but then it's weird cuz the very next,0.22431262
shot you're like did you turn off the D aging and they're like it's just,0.6327539
not as clean some shots what do you want from us so De Niro and,0.13906595
Pesci here play the younger versions of themselves and they cover quite a long their,0.05334773
lives acting-wise I think they do that very well but technology wise well the face,0.07606308
D aging is again somewhat effective all Scorsese accomplishes is putting young faces on older,0.07104893
bodies both in how they look and how they move I don't know if you,0.08290383
saw the reason I didn't notice it as much in Captain Marvel but the recent,0.023509586
honest trailer for that pointed out that Sam Jackson even types like like an older,0.074543804
gentleman despite the D aging on his face but here you really notice it particularly,0.15111242
the first D H seen they have De Niro and Pesci working on a truck,0.085563235
engine and in the close-ups there their hands are noticeably the hands of you know,0.051136658
guys who are as old as of Pesci and De Niro actually are so that,0.14355195
was it was just it was just jarring and you're like I don't know if,0.06078182
this was worth it I mean they could have just dyed their hair black as,0.28643146
I think they did to some degree and it would have been the same thing,0.035023913
but thankfully De Niro Pesci and mr. Al Pacino are legendary for being their own,0.053388968
best special effects and what keeps this movie interesting throughout are their incredible performances not,0.021216698
just incredible but it's interesting to see all three of them play roles that are,0.015470176
so different than how we are famous for knowing them right so De Niro is,0.0128852725
differential right a soldier instead of a general and the army analogy to the mob,0.03878353
is used I think very effectively subtly but I think effectively the movies very subtle,0.035707057
in many regards I wonder how much people will actually pick up about what it's,0.028564982
saying I picked up a lot and I still found it kind of boring in,0.052996513
places all right so Pesci is calm collected and a respected leader I know and,0.02075639
Pacino is totally out of control but also a total lovable softie ah he was,0.0678474
so sweet but by the way his supposedly emphasis on supposedly Midwestern accent was all,0.018851304
over the place sometimes it decided to show up to say sometimes it didn't I'd,0.020483
be like just forget it al you can't do it consistently so forget it I,0.026899362
guess there's I forget the accents forget the D aging technology this is just a,0.016186578
very good play which is I think is also good way to sit smallest good,0.037626114
streaming show that's a good way to describe it I also appreciated the history of,0.024293171
the mob Hoffa and the Kennedys you know that's not very rarely delved into and,0.042107455
as the movie continually points out many people today don't even know who Jimmy Hoffa,0.053239305
is and I think cuz they're focusing on how uh instead of perhaps the Kennedys,0.048761286
part of the story that's very much in the background and not until like the,0.022668129
second half for the last third of the last hour or so or the movie,0.025076758
I don't know how riveted it will be for people who aren't into history but,0.048416723
I like history so I thought that stuff was cool I also like the subtle,0.04423205
revelation again sometimes the movie might be too subtle for its own good but I,0.023907365
like this connection that banks back in the day couldn't get involved in gambling so,0.01984908
they couldn't invest in casinos and such fare so that left that left an opening,0.011125197
for the mob but today of course banks and all businesses are involved in all,0.018010512
kinds of shady dealings with often government involvement so there's no business left for the,0.016108086
mob and as I said that's really interesting when you think about it so I,0.037578885
liked that takeaway there also as is usually the case with this type of movie,0.02811066
plenty of little and big life lessons to learn and some scenes sprinkled throughout as,0.032601982
I said the movie has some serious laws but there are scenes here and there,0.0114079
with almost Tarantino level dialogue and shoot again far not throughout not consistent but there,0.114715576
were a lot of scenes where people in the audience was laughing very hard myself,0.11410095
included very good De Niro and Pesci also shine showing their characters towards the end,0.057926852
of their lives the passage of time physically mentally and this is a zinger emotionally,0.15408313
I was pretty blown away the final few scenes are incredibly moving really I mean,0.106535815
I've told you before you want to open your movie strong and you want to,0.051231112
end your movie strong I think the movie did kind of open strong open strong,0.055205587
but it ended I'm sure that it ended very strong and I think that'll help,0.020114489
how people remember it again if you get you'll get to the end of a,0.026083846
Scorsese movie it might take you a few days but you'll get there and I,0.058147695
thought that the ending was so moving that I think it could end up getting,0.038538747
De Niro and acting nomination as well I don't know about a win the passage,0.049497645
of time was very convincing and he does have some really strong emotional scenes like,0.014937364
really like a gift to an actor even though I thought at the beginning he,0.033454083
was hamming it up a little bit so I don't think he's a strong contender,0.09820705
but I think he's in the mix but speaking of senior citizens the movie is,0.019534448
set up like you're visiting grandpa the senior at the Senior Center and boy to,0.030731484
see you have a story to tell you which is an excellent framing device it's,0.032417726
a it's really a very clever framing device and it's very well set up but,0.023980536
you know what's not so great choosing to have the pacing and the energy of,0.027625076
a story that grandpa tells you I mean as I said the movie is super,0.068354934
slow and feels super long and I actually almost dozed off I got very little,0.054543063
sleep last night but still if it had been a really good movie I would,0.07263806
have paid attention but I was like really fighting to stay awake towards the end,0.029641248
of the second hour whoa I mean it really was like spending a few hours,0.03586404
at your grandparents house because if again the pacing the energy the sex the actors,0.30098322
it was it was it was office a little surreal in that regard and also,0.02467033
speaking of The Godfather Part two again that's also three plus hours I recently watched,0.01865308
it for the Labor Day weekend went down to Little Italy had some dinner then,0.10440257
watched The Godfather Part two which has a lot of scene and seems a little,0.019767262
italy fabulous evening and I was riveted to that movie the entire time never lost,0.17630227
a step loved it and while this is a very long movie oddly Scorsese has,0.030764744
made it a very small movie in scope the cinematography the locations none of it,0.030681595
warrants the big screen in fact this could easily be a four episode streaming series,0.012366429
on Netflix which is what it basically is also well it's a different story the,0.009207472
movie is so similar to The Godfather films the first two and Goodfellas etc with,0.024248604
the same actors but that also keeps them it keeps it from feeling fresh and,0.017204309
new the movie is very funny again as I said and has some surprisingly fun,0.029001342
turns from Steven Graham who we all know plays a very good mobster but also,0.10780898
Ray Romano was used incredibly well here I love gray Romano here and there are,0.024022441
some cameos really great cameos sprinkled throughout a lot of times like oh look who,0.06643588
it is oh look look I love that person awesome now obviously in a movie,0.04477617
like this the women's roles aren't great although Goodfellas of course had a pretty strong,0.14275041
female role and I guess uh Diane Keaton was so annoying and the Godfather movies,0.25766996
it's a little bit hard to include her as well but here I thought Katherine,0.111210726
Narducci as Pesci's wife made an impression and it was nice to see dascha Polanco,0.07543116
from orange is the new black even if it was just for one scene she,0.06924229
stood out though good for her she made the most of it so I definitely,0.045719404
watch the Irishman I just stream it and as I said you might might want,0.07350745
to make it a two-night event you might be like no grace I want to,0.12098826
power through it I'm gonna watch this whole thing in one night cuz it's a,0.052730437
Scorsese movie damn it but I bet you you fall asleep and you'll have to,0.66876286
watch it the next night unless you start it like speaking of senior citizens you,0.045463305
start it like a four o'clock maybe then you could do it maybe you'd be,0.07526154
a good after Sunday afternoon movie which is how I recommended you watch Romo by,0.023886744
the way I watched Romo myself on a rainy Sunday I was like let's try,0.19752562
this again because the credits were so long I'd finished my dinner one evening trying,0.049896754
to watch it and I was like forget this so I went back on a,0.022544404
rainy afternoon and I watched the whole thing all the way through and ice again,0.030699555
again as I said I felt it was worth it and I would describe the,0.040455803
Irishman the same way for both the positive and the negative so that's my review,0.056738168
