first requested to me by Hunter Brown and directed and co-written by Pete docter inside-out,0.049792986
is a 2015 Pixar animation film that accounts the story of young Reilly and everything,0.02068189
going on within her mind Reilly is an only child moves to San Francisco with,0.0299765
her mom and dad at the age of 11 and has trouble coping with the,0.24419294
move at first there's five emotions that help dictate her behaviors and decision-making and these,0.025463896
five emotions all have something different to offer to Riley's personality and they include joy,0.035344534
sadness anger fear and disgust and all these emotions attempt to provide Riley with the,0.10850476
most well-rounded and satisfying life possible but one day something goes terribly wrong and the,0.077642895
five emotions are forced to solve an entirely new problem for Riley all right so,0.016654203
when so that was a film that I figured I need to watch again because,0.024127541
I know that it's beloved by almost everyone inhaled it's one of the best Pixar,0.04671319
films today top 5 for most people at least and well for me I remember,0.02584704
watching it back in 2015 and thinking it was all right but not want to,0.021319136
Pixar's best like everyone else was saying I enjoyed it but I didn't fall in,0.03712656
love with it like many others did and when I watched it again yesterday I,0.038355153
still feel pretty much the same way I think that there are exceptional moments in,0.025067445
this film and other moments and even long stretches of time actually where just loses,0.03909351
me basically anything that has Riley in it or addresses her actually facing real problems,0.05369296
relatable problems at almost every viewer can understand and empathize with her on that's when,0.02606123
I like it when I don't like it is when something happens this sends two,0.052460372
of the emotion characters off from the rest of the group and it separates them,0.018589223
from the group in a separate plotline they sort of takes over the film and,0.0276743
they have to find their way back to the headquarters this guy little plot line,0.08215351
this whole conflict just kind of lost me and I found this act in general,0.044100344
plotline to be kind of boring and emotionally dry I think any time that we,0.11559628
actually see Riley and the effect that her emotions are actually having on her and,0.020796966
the difficulty she's experiencing as an 11 year old child dealing with a difficult move,0.07739279
on top of other things that's when the movie hooks me it got me in,0.04072188
the fields there because even though I've never had to deal with a difficult move,0.026760338
specifically like that there's plenty of other things that she's going through that I could,0.04861761
relate to feelings of insecurity trying to fit in and make friends feeling like no,0.015185477
one understands how you're feeling in general these are all complex feelings and just things,0.017413843
that kids go through that I think Pixar tackles pretty creatively and pretty effectively and,0.048628915
inside out the problem for me is that they don't always stick to it this,0.024595166
movie really got me in the fields quite a bit actually but like I said,0.043916754
it just loses me every the two emotions go off on their own plot line,0.10697617
and start trying to navigate their way to return to the control center and we,0.011542266
stabilize things for Riley at this point the film starts to focus too heavily on,0.01959764
characters that in my opinion just aren't quite strong enough to stand on their own,0.05157169
for this plotline you primarily follow joy and sadness played by Amy Poehler and Phyllis,0.018194104
Smith respectively who performed the role admirably but are ultimately voicing characters that feel very,0.0044287927
uninspired it's not like these characters don't have distinct personalities they certainly do but I,0.037004832
just feel like they're not that interesting and they can't effectively carry the story along,0.022324894
as a buddy duo the way the film asked them to but like I mentioned,0.029087815
I do have to get Pixar credit for creating a really compelling and creative story,0.009354478
here pretty much every Pixar film in existence delivers something for everyone it delivers fun,0.08085773
it delivers silly but it also delivers a story that has way more depth to,0.14604972
it than almost all of its animated competitors the premise of the story itself is,0.011061339
very cool emotions that are pulling the strings within your mind they dictate how you,0.06262372
respond to the world around you is a very interesting concept and it's mostly pretty,0.05003711
well executed I did continually think to myself that this is a very cool concept,0.1453087
for an animated film and it tackles some important issues that almost every kid faces,0.038228106
at some point the film certainly has to be recognized for its creativity and how,0.046143126
it just approaches complex subject matter however here's something else I didn't quite love there's,0.021782769
a character named sadness that I previously mentioned played by Phyllis Smith who gave off,0.011556235
some real finding Dory vibes to me because she's basically a killjoy and it's all,0.25729597
about being sad and making Riley sad and all that and I just found her,0.038221452
character to be very tough to deal with in large doses and there is a,0.041028526
purpose to her a bigger picture to the character that's made clear in the third,0.044912536
act but man every time she was talking on screen I were just like can,0.027504014
we please cut to another emotion because she just really started to wear on me,0.17715436
and I think I'd be fine with her in small doses but she plays a,0.1096941
very big role in the second act and onward and I just felt like her,0.041686393
character didn't contribute anything positive to the overall enjoyment level of the film and considering,0.014519629
this is an animated kid's film first and foremost I think I'd be pretty remiss,0.08748562
if I didn't at least discuss the brand of comedy with you because I think,0.0539424
it works pretty well for the most part and I consider it a pro because,0.034757175
it definitely is well written for the most part and witty more often than not,0.015816737
there's definitely cases where I can get a little too kiddush with some of the,0.053655043
emotion characters just sort of doing over-the-top things are designed to be sort of slapstick,0.09762035
and appease to a kids sense of humor but generally speaking I did find myself,0.045422066
chuckling fairly often and the comedy does help balance out some pretty serious tone ISM,0.048656188
to feel more versatile and of course more family-friendly but overall I don't love inside-out,0.028157223
it's not one of my favorite Pixar films but I do think it's alright it's,0.0483216
not a bad film and I totally understand people that like it more than I,0.054455258
do but for me there's just a couple things holding you back from being great,0.056032408
either way let's take a look at the pros cons list so as for the,0.03776713
pros I thought inside-out executes a rich and creative premise has strong coming-of-age themes that,0.1435034
are ripe with emotion and also offers some quality comedy to balance the film out,0.024484744
as for the cons I think the film loses some momentum for most back to,0.035688434
and a little bit after that as well and some of the characters just aren't,0.029290697
the strongest overall I'm gonna give inside-out a 7 point 5 out of 10 and,0.07396377
generally recommend you check it out wherever you can if you're looking for a well-rounded,0.049136452
Pixar film to me this isn't one of their best but it's still solid enough,0.053248618
so if you guys seen inside out what did you think of it and if,0.040648706
not let me know why not know so let me know your favorite Pixar film,0.07152454
still Toy Story 3 for me either way that's all for now this is wolf,0.059068307
