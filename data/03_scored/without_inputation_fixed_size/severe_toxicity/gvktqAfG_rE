people have problems with that movie I absolutely adored it it is one of the,0.10678858

any of the latest trailers I only seen the first teaser trailer and then that,0.026316661
comic-con featurette behind the scenes thingy but other than that I stayed away from other,0.043538265
trailers and I actually did not know what to expect from it and what I,0.028229728
got was a very different and mature and metaphorical Star Wars film that isn't just,0.012740928
a fantastic Star Wars movie it is a great and powerful film itself that a,0.026471648
movie lovers can see and just be amazed by incredible direction by incredible filmmaking the,0.01878146
visuals in this movie are out of this world literally it is just such a,0.04995396
beautiful looking movie the CGI the set design everything the musical score by John Williams,0.04165779
just everything in this movie looks on point and most importantly what this movie does,0.032168947
in regards to the story it just builds upon this character so much more it,0.03538245
is a similar thing what Empire Strikes Back did because the first Star Wars movie,0.017489674
was a very entertaining adventure film it was very fast paced it was very enjoyable,0.035443645
just like the force awakens but then Empire Strikes Back built upon those characters it,0.030911084
was much darker the movie went down some roads that a lot of people probably,0.046150442
did not expect just like the last Jedi there were things in this movie that,0.03485895
surprised me so much there were some moments where I was like okay that is,0.036091533
very weird for a Star Wars movie I do not actually know how some of,0.022032212
the fans will react that in fact I don't actually know how to feel about,0.02497299
that at the moment but then when you let some of the things sink in,0.028377399
and you're like oh my god there's just a completely different meaning to it there,0.021417582
is a lot of deeper thoughts that went into developing this screenplay and just everything,0.021082995
comes together so beautifully towards the ending of the movie there were just some things,0.11943372
when you are maybe not all that sure about but then towards the ending certain,0.049054634
things are revealed now this actually puts all the other things in the different perspective,0.015020512
this might just place with you it is a brilliant screenplay by Rian Johnson and,0.02879979
also the directing by him it is just like I said such a beautiful movie,0.04510677
certain shots in this one were so not traditional Star Wars but they had place,0.045593016
in this movie because they just felt right there were just some shots which were,0.14122248
beautiful the editing everything it isn't as fast-paced of a movie as the force awakens,0.043405894
was but there's just so much more beneath the surface in regards to the story,0.026452359
in regards to the characters Daisy Ridley as rain this movie is fantastic her character,0.03728687
it just built upon so mother's a lot of conflict in certain characters and you,0.11363997
are just there to experience all of that it is just such a beautiful movie,0.021987645
to watch and experience it for yourself through the eyes of those characters and also,0.051543087
I really like just like in the force awakens Adam driver as kylo Ren that,0.032148324
character I just loved and loved and loved more I really loved him in the,0.033470046
force awakens and in the last year he's even better his character is also very,0.018825362
built upon from the previous movie and let's just talk about Mark Hamill as Luke,0.04850785
Skywalker just great fantastic I really liked how they portrayed this character in this movie,0.06594963
Carrie Fisher rest in peace Carrie Fisher her character was also really strong in this,0.021098295
movie John boyega as Finn also had to do in this movie and certain things,0.04842005
that happen with his character were also very strong and powerful and just almost every,0.015395676
single character in this movie is so much more than they were in the previous,0.037174452
one there were also some newcomers like Benicio del Toro and Laura Dern I also,0.13051103
thought that those characters had a lot of things to go for that were very,0.018119603
strong at the same time bb-8 is just awesome I just love bb-8 and also,0.028416645
the humor in this movie I was very surprised but overall as a movie it,0.031751875
is a much darker film from the force awakens I know that a lot of,0.020093203
people compared the force awakens to a new hope there were a lot of similarities,0.08064221
between those movies yes and other people are also scared that this movie will be,0.054588296
much too similar to Empire Strikes Back there are similarities to that movie but this,0.01997613
is such a original Star Wars film there were some moments where I was just,0.010541165
blown away I just could not believe what I was seeing there were just some,0.069095954
metaphorical scenes and things were happening and I was like okay what the hell does,0.27035442
that mean now I absolutely adored the last Jedi it isn't as fast-paced as the,0.01917658
force awakens but it basically builds upon what that movie did so much more and,0.052291416
it is just such a powerful film certain things that go down towards the ending,0.09863011
like in the third act the third act in this movie is so goddamn awesome,0.32407823
it is so suspenseful I had so much fun with this movie it is truly,0.065345645
an awesome Star Wars film but it is also much more than that it is,0.015782813
