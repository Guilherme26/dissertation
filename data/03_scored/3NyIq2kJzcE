the DCE you wonder woman this one's a pretty big deal for the Studio One,0.15143849
because Batman or Superman and Suicide Squad didn't exactly live up to expectations and then,0.22209015
too because it is a thousand time we get a female at superhero movie that,0.14972897
being said I was really hoping director patty Jenkins would just completely knock it out,0.15326762
of the park with this one it isn't perfect Wonder Woman is still a fantastic,0.12443994
film for a number of reasons the movie takes place way before the events of,0.06110621
Batman for Superman during World War one Diana is living a fairly quiet life hidden,0.15340318
away on the island of samos Karen until Steve Trevor's plane crashes in that area,0.24840094
after hearing about the war and all the evil taking place in the world beyond,0.25692177
that mascara from Steve Diana decides it is time to leave home and do what,0.091229185
she can to save the world alright so let's kick things off with some things,0.40213642
that work really well and there's really no better place to start than with gal,0.09855162
gadot performance the times of doubting her acting chops are over she is just so,0.13353941
great and perfectly cast as Wonder Woman she sold strong and confident and bbs and,0.13339733
now here we go back to a time when Diana is first learning what she's,0.069451496
capable of and what the world is like and the dot does a great job,0.067009985
playing in that range you believer is a fish out of water and the same,0.10430664
is true when she's a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield another great,0.13861948
bit of casting it's Chris Pine brass is because he became a familiar name via,0.06686158
a big franchise with 2009 Star Trek but this guy really deserves even more credit,0.17526804
than he gets he is just one heck of an actor who always brings more,0.34948465
to the roles he gets than what's on the page originally and Wonder Woman is,0.10434398
no different not only does he have great chemistry with gadot but he also has,0.08311338
great chemistry with everyone around him and for particular supporting characters that's the main reason,0.0377144
they make an impression Samus Kara is also a big highlight of the film it,0.058775462
is just so refreshing to see some frightful visuals and some really strong and majestic,0.098555185
female heroes particularly Robin Wright the lifestyle and history of Emma Skye are also super,0.12004411
interesting and appealing and it's the location of one of the best fight sequences in,0.084561266
the entire film only downside to all this is that I wish more of wonder,0.08042716
women to play here but there's still some funds we had beyond the mascara because,0.2422228
another big win and Wonder Woman is the humor it speaks to give a performance,0.15007594
her chemistry with pine the two of them just really play off each other so,0.15122096
so well when it comes to all those jokes about Stan and not understanding the,0.058132138
basics of human life and life in London that quality of Diana also comes into,0.16086975
play in a really interesting way with war she basically processes everything as good versus,0.1720225
bad if innocence are in need of help you help them it's as simple as,0.15029404
that and it is a really inspiring and refreshing thought process that we don't get,0.07447319
to see too often it's a really powerful component of the film alright so before,0.060165375
moving over to the negatives I think it is important to reiterate a movie can,0.119340114
have fuzz and still be great so that being said want to Wonder Woman's flaws,0.18599826
is pacing particularly in the second half it's long and it does start to feel,0.07619248
like it after we leave some mascara the color palette is a little bit dark,0.2254953
and dreary and some of the quieter conversation driven moments aren't really as engrossing as,0.07637713
they need to be and it's tough to talk villain without getting into spoilers but,0.06783581
I will say that while Wonder Woman has an excellent concept for the villainy featured,0.23721014
in the film just isn't executed as well as we could have been but again,0.11647798
flaws aside this is the movie we needed Wonder Woman is getting a three and,0.14673261
a half on the Dewey Decimal scale because it's got a fantastic lead performance an,0.10921406
ensemble that has so much chemistry and perhaps more important than anything because Wonder Woman,0.2240173
is oozing with heart and positivity you get to root so hard to leave for,0.090905756
the Niro you get to feel inspired and then you get to leave with a,0.10406533
whole lot of hope for what's to come in the DC EU I can't wait,0.13379979
to see what the studio's do with this character moving forward and I can't wait,0.05141097
