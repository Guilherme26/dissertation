hey guys it's steph welcome to my channel i've had a very busy couple of weeks here so i have kind of gotten off of my regular posting schedule but i just wanted to get this video up as soon as i could because i was just so excited to watch it and to react to it on my channel because a lot of people have given me requests for this especially on my inside out commentary today we are going to be watching coco i know i've been doing a lot of horror and i still have a huge list of movies that have been requested or just movies that i really want to watch on my channel that i'm going to be getting to but this one i really wanted to do as soon as i could i don't know much about this movie at all i believe it is about the day of the dead and it's about the main characters kind of like ancestry and culture and kind of learning about that i know this movie has such high praises so many people have said what an amazing movie this is anyways that's really all i have to say about this i'm so excited to watch so let's get into it oh i love this intro already [Music] i can already tell this is going to be such a beautifully designed and animated movie the papa he was a musician he and his family would sing and dance and one day he left with his guitar and never returned they always gotta hit us with a sad story in the beginning she didn't have time to cry over that walkway musician oh okay after banishing all music from her life she found a way to provide for her daughter oh you're a twig nico have some more no gracias i asked if you would like more thumbnails i feel like grandmothers in a lot of different cultures just love giving the grandchildren as much food as possible oh that's rough music is amazing oh my gosh is this dog gonna be a main character [Music] wow i love that dog nesto de la cruz took his first steps towards becoming the most beloved singer in mexico is this going to be his great great grandfather that tore his family apart until 1942 [Music] when he was crushed by [Music] come on what did the la cruz always say seizure moment oh that's like his little mentor yeah i don't blame him for being terrified to tell them that he likes music if that's how they react to this it's just poor dante follow you forever now go get my shoe i love the humor in this so far all this work to bring the family together look how beautiful that is coming home no mama it's okay oh this is really cool because i don't know a lot about the day of the dead and what the traditions are so i think that this is really cool that disney did a movie representing a different culture and different traditions this music is so beautiful i'm gonna play mariachi plaza if it kills me [Music] nothing we've all decided it's time joined us in the workshop i'm sure he'll be thrilled to do that carrying on the family's tradition i also don't trust that dog underneath there i feel like he's gonna mess something up oh my god i knew it [Music] he was so close i knew it i'm gonna be a musician what is all this you keep secrets from your own family it's all that i mean yeah you guys react very poorly to anything regarding music you said my family would guide me well de la cruz is my family he's got a point oh god is she gonna break his guitar or something i don't care if i'm on some stupid ofrenda [Music] wow that's beautiful oh god he's gonna try and steal his guitar your great great grandson i need to borrow this oh no i'm gonna play the plaza just like you did [Music] that is pretty terrifying i oh is this his family [Music] yeah see i love that i hope he adopts the dog at the end and he becomes part of the family i'm pretty sure i saw something like that shot in the trailer and i thought it was so cool looking [Music] look at all of that oh your photos are in your son have a great listen yes what about the worker they don't get to see their family okay when i say that was pretty bad just now that that was a lie and i apologize for doing that no photo that's really sad i don't know what i do if no one put up my photo i know that sounds so depressing you starve from the dead but i wasn't stealing the guitar it was my great great grandfather's yeah don't say that in front of her you know she's the reason why the whole family hates music i give you my blessing to go home to put my photo back on the ofrenda and to never play music again what she can't do that here we go mariachi plus here i come [Music] two seconds and you already break your promise i've just had a really hard dialogue and i could really use an amigo right now oh i'll be your friend oh you like de la cruz he and i go way back i can get your front proceeds to his sunrise spectacular show this is de la cruz no one's ever put up my picture but you can change that this is okay so he's not de la cruz well this is great because he needed a friend so now he has one one hiccup the la cruz is a tough guy to get to and i need to cross that bridge soon like yeah he definitely doesn't know de la cruz right he's just lying about that hey you said you have real tickets that that was a lie i apologize for that at least he's honest and feels remorse or maybe he only feels remorse when he gets caught that's probably it actually and they go to drink from the milk of their mother who is a cactus but also me and her milk is not him this is quite an elaborate piece ernesto doesn't do rehearsals he's too busy hosting the fancy party at the top of his tower i know where we have to go i don't want to see your stupid face actor come on my favorite character promise we'll bring it right back like the time you promised to bring back my van or my mini fridge oh just yeah he has a bad track record you okay i'm fading it i can feel it oh cause no one remembers him why am i getting emotional oh yeah i'm with the dog on this one when there's no one left in the living world who remembers you you disappear from this world oh that is so heartbreaking that was actually a question i had in the beginning where it's like obviously families are honoring those in their family that they love that have passed on but eventually if people stop having children in your family everyone's gonna forget about you at some point if generations don't pass on these stories and these people that's really sad [Music] is ernesto de la cruz going to be really rude or not appreciative of miguel i don't know i'm just stressed about he idolizes him so much when he actually meets him i feel like people are always so disappointed when they meet their idols okay even the dog is disappointed i'm nervous for him [Music] you got this let's go [Music] hector's great don't go crazy he's a natural [Music] i love their friendship oh my gosh this is one of the most wholesome and pure friendships i think i've seen in a movie in a very long time [Music] why do you have to ruin everything run away from his family they just want to send him back to the line of the living room you said that was your only family the only person who could send you home i do have another family i could have taken my photo back this whole time okay this friendship crumbled a lot faster than i thought it would keep your dumb photos stay away from me now [Music] music's the only thing that makes me happy it's very selfish of the family to be like you can't like music because one person that was mean to us and screwed us over was a musician if my family was like this oh my gosh i would be the same way as miguel i wanted to put down roots he wanted to play for the world what's more selfish than leaving your family to go do pursue music do pursue to go pursue music is to then ban every single other person in your family from liking listening to playing music [Music] all right the moment of truth is coming i'm so nervous for him this is like jay gatsby's parties this is a lot [Music] he really had it there are you all right nino my boy with a talent like yours how could i not listen okay he seems nice [Music] i have a great great grandson good okay i was really nervous he was going to be mean or i don't know i am sorry to see you go home again i hope you die oh he's going to try and give him the blessing and it's not going to work i give you my blessing you said you take back my photo you promised miguel he told me he knew you hector please began you're being forgotten and whose fault is that hector please those were my songs you took my songs that made you famous being forgotten is because you never told anyone that i wrote them that's crazy they let go no we made a great team but you died and i knew something was gonna go wrong he couldn't be perfect i would move heaven and earth but in the movie this is not good hate me if you want but my mind is made up so people are calling him chorizo even though that's not the reason he died or something i oh my gosh all right i um i did not see any of this coming security you took everything away from me poor hector i would hate to have you think that you murdered hector for his songs you don't think that everyone knows the good guy yeah we know security take care of miguel he'll be extending his stay whatever family [Music] success doesn't come for free yeah you have to be willing to do whatever it takes to seize your mom but you're dead i trusted him right hector to the rescue right hector and dante they told me not to be like but i didn't listen well you didn't know that he was actual trash oh no i just wanted to see her again i never should have left santa cecilia hector deserves the best but he loved her so much like wait a minute [Music] this makes so much sense it's him that's my mama coco that's my mommy melda is that you oh this is so much better is that on me oh my gosh what an amazing plot twist [Music] the family wrongly understands what happens because he was trying to come home [Music] wow this is so cute ew i don't wanna be crying oh all right get it together [Music] dante to the rescue god you look good [Music] oh yeah maybe too soon to try that out [Music] i didn't want to listen but he was right nothing is more important than family [Music] but first i need to find de la cruz to get ectorso wow so he can see coco again hector should be on our friend he's part of our fam try to go it's true imelda and so what if it's true you leave me alone with a child to raise and i people make mistakes he was coming back i'm running out of time it's coco true i i can't forgive you but i will help you that's fair okay progress good luck muchacho gracias oh i love this photo give it to me again send miguel home got your pedals now we just have to [Music] wait you're related to hector the photo [Music] you shouldn't have pointed at it you should just quick grabbed it [Music] oh i really don't want that floor to be ripped up be very careful please is she gonna tell the truth of what happened actually and that hector should be the one that everyone loves not de la cruz oh or she's just to sing [Music] she is killing it can you guys wait until after she's done okay good to go home to put up our photo and to never never play music again do never forget how much your family loves you oh she came around [Music] who's willing to do what it takes to seize my moment that's not really what that should mean [Music] apologies old friend but the show must go on really turned around oh no orchestra listen this gives me paulo an isabella vibe it's from blizzy mcguire movie [Music] we love to see history repeat itself it's almost sunrise no no i can't leave you i promised i'd put your photo up i promise i won't let goku forget you no she's not gonna forget i have faith that it's gonna turn around he wanted you to have this oh is he gonna play remember me [Music] not again [Music] oh god this movie is so emotional i kept his letters a photo [Music] my heart is so warm okay all right let's see what happens yes they're our families and they're counting on us to remember them oh that's sad but now she's with her family right enjoy your visit oh yay finally i'm so happy for him this is such an amazing ending oh i'm not gonna cry for a third time though i'm done i'm done maybe i don't know [Music] wow i loved that ending well i love the whole movie but that was a beautiful way to end it okay all right there's i'm not crying again there's just still some tears that didn't get wiped away i loved this movie this honestly might be one of my if not my favorite pixar movie now like i said it was so cool to see other cultures other traditions other main characters that we don't normally see in these pixar movies being represented here i think that's an amazing thing that disney did with this movie and i hope they continue to represent other cultures and traditions and people from all over the world the visual aspect was breathtaking it was beautiful and i expected that again it's a disney pixar i get it but i just am blown away by the animation on this movie i loved all the music especially the last song and the last scene anyways guys that was all i have for you today thank you so much for watching and i will see you guys next time for another video
