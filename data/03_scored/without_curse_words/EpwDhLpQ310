want to make sure that I give a special thank you to mr. design junkie,0.31089434

from all of the amazing fan art that he's had for black panther make sure,0.24127348
that you go follow him on Twitter and Instagram because his work is absolutely amazing,0.076556444
so getting into Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler and I absolutely loved this film,0.15169777
I was shocked that I love this one because I actually got scared before I,0.093714245
went to go see it because when the embargo lifted and all the reviews came,0.032846887
out I was like yeah like I know this movie's gonna be great but I,0.07757664
felt like it was a little bit over height and I was scared because my,0.12288513
level of excitement was even higher because of how good the reviews were so I,0.05064544
didn't want to feel like I was setting myself up for failure if the reviews,0.06951952
completely overhyped the film but I will have to tell you that the movie is,0.072444044
very very good it definitely is a different type of Marvel film than what you're,0.15011927
used to seeing and I actually appreciate that now first and foremost the casting for,0.045264635
this film is simply amazing the casting for this film is so good and the,0.08224278
character development of the majority of the cast is so amazing that sometimes you forget,0.08313796
that there's a movie is about to chawla okay because you have all these different,0.10045995
story arcs from the other characters and they're just as entertaining to watch on the,0.047040906
screen that you kind of forget like oh yeah like I'm in a Black Panther,0.26888564
movie so I thought the casting decisions were absolutely amazing for this film now I,0.084085785
have to talk about the female presence of this movie and it's for a different,0.16818038
reason now a lot of people talked about the door of menagerie and they're basically,0.07279566
in this badass all-female army that protects the king but I really want to talk,0.4897503
about the diversity of female empowerment from the different types of characters because not only,0.1925492
do you have the general of the dorm Elisha who is this badass woman she,0.5412186
was one of my favorite characters to watching the action sequences but you also have,0.03663624
someone like Nakia who is kind of like an independent rebel who fights for her,0.17728733
country just in a different way than what you see the dorm lij I'm do,0.114949405
and then you have two childless little sisters sharee who is definitely gonna be the,0.088399746
fan favorite she was my favorite in the entire movie not only is she absolutely,0.13636541
hilarious in the film but she's a 16 year old genius not only is she,0.2088829
a 16 year old genius she isn't the smartest person on the planet yes she,0.28109673
is smarter than Toni start and she is responsible for the some of the technological,0.17950726
advances that what kind of continues to have so I really like the different types,0.07906869
of female characters that you see it was really refreshing not only just to get,0.14985307
the strong warrior-type but to get the highly intelligent woman as well or the independent,0.2740354
kind of spy type of female so I really appreciated that and especially as a,0.3032838
black woman seeing all these different types of black women who were basically just as,0.15901364
important to the film as Black Panther himself it was really great to see now,0.10719347
we have talked about this villain okay because when y'all started talk about this villain,0.18997099
y'all were like this is the best villain that I've ever seen that was just,0.15737213
like okay yeah it's not like it was gonna be that hard to do that,0.17990309
because the villains are and issue in these types of films but I absolutely enjoy,0.12127618
Michael B Jordan and yes I said Michael B Jordan because he was looking like,0.10505745
a little snack okay after you didn't lost ten pounds and you want to reward,0.15394337
your suffer at that cheat meal that was Michael Bay Jordan this kill monger okay,0.67779875
yes he was getting it in a movie but back to him being a good,0.13978319
villain I enjoy kill monger now a lot of people compare him to Loki saying,0.839015
the best villain says Loki but for me I'm gonna compare him closer to a,0.21040677
vulture just because I feel as though would both of their storylines I felt as,0.10876383
though because of their circumstances of what happened to them you kind of sympathize with,0.10780825
them as a character and then you almost felt like well yo given given the,0.060200933
same circumstances that she went through I would too and I was okay with that,0.10458782
and will kill monger is even is his circumstances are hiding to where not only,0.53490317
do you sympathize for his character but because he was speaking so much truth in,0.0724367
this film like he will be talking I'd be like yep message okay cuz he,0.17826785
didn't tell no lies he told that one lie in this film and it was,0.26517355
hard because you know that this is a hero film but it's kind of just,0.068105794
like I was okay either way I was like if if the hero wins I'm,0.08638469
okay but if the villain lives I'm a little too because he was speaking of,0.15488553
truth and so I think that's why a lot of people enjoyed his character because,0.06952199
he had character development and because the backstory of how his life turned into that,0.10145207
direction I think it really set him up to be a very good villain but,0.22096126
he was also funny too he was funny yeah like he was saved me he,0.10351889
would be serious but it would be funny and that kind of leads me to,0.10896139
another thing that I liked about this film the jokes the movie was funny at,0.10257468
the right times and I think as a black person because I felt as though,0.42763868
it was like black jokes it was junk so like black people will get cuz,0.8097373
it's like something that a black person will predominantly say to another black person which,0.67407084
made it even more hilarious and that's not to say that if you're not black,0.6005013
that you're not gonna get the jokes you're definitely gonna get and they're gonna be,0.107493125
funny whoever watches it but I just think it's a black person just given the,0.5876557
context of the jokes it made it even funnier even made it even more funny,0.10106711
for me so I thought that the movie knew when to take yourself seriously in,0.15186246
a new one to lighten up the mood but it wasn't in a cheesy way,0.07651003
it's so natural and because the movie felt so natural it didn't feel like a,0.056592423
superhero movie and I think that's because of the real-life topics that they talked about,0.1100111
they definitely talked about imperialism colonialism they talked about immigration this is there's this battle,0.09606211
of what do you do intervene with another country to try to you know help,0.11045153
them do better you know and I feel like a lot of the issues that,0.056075092
were talking about are relatable to the issues that we talked about as a country,0.059822883
today and I appreciate it that they did not try to like sugarcoat it they,0.06837447
called it what it was it wasn't preachy preachy it was done just right and,0.053115085
I appreciate it being so real which made it such a relatable film it's like,0.1090097
they it's a superhero film but it's not doesn't feel that way I definitely agree,0.086445555
with the comparisons that this is a Bond film made like the political thriller yes,0.07789458
now as much as I love this movie there were a few just a few,0.07935398
issues now a lot of people talk about the CG with the extra scenes I,0.07863414
didn't have an issue with majority of the action scenes I only had an issue,0.063355334
with the one with the two Panthers and I didn't like the music that was,0.059289474
paired with it that's really nitpicking it really wasn't necessary to say but that was,0.063744746
an issue for me as well as a little bit of the pasty some of,0.106813595
the parts of the beginning felt a little bit like too long but overall as,0.090628065
a film pacing wise I didn't feel like I was in a two hour and,0.044764478
14 minutes which was a good thing I just felt like there were a couple,0.113647595
of parts in the beginning that they didn't need to dwell on as much but,0.051983878
for me I love this movie I really love this movie I love that this,0.09768212
movie is dispelling the myths that are predominantly black cast with positive black characters can't,0.039852183
do well in the box office and we see that from what it's doing with,0.05305959
the presale tickets I love is of the beautiful presence of like women like doing,0.30896774
the damn thing and in a positive way I just love this movie so much,0.69542736
I'm so happy they were continued this is not just the first black superhero film,0.15248324
it's the first predominantly black cast with a Marvel movie but we had movies like,0.14955273
companies like Blankman we had meteor man we had spawn we had blade like we,0.40994978
had a lot of movies but I love that this movie is getting so much,0.063132726
height that we can continue to make other movies like this and even continue it,0.06856493
out into different genres I love this film I'm so happy that I got to,0.12397094
see this early I can't wait to go see it again on Monday and give,0.08044558
you a more in-depth look on my thoughts about this film but I'm gonna leave,0.2164835
it right there for now my name is shir rana from pier weight and if,0.117202476
