it's very sad and very scary that when it comes to hatred in America so,0.34555742
little has changed since the 1970s when this film takes place I mean on top,0.103022195
of black Klansmen intentionally and powerfully driving home its point with actual footage of Charlottesville,0.11057411
in 2017 in that whole situation including footage of President Trump at the end of,0.09973246
the film black Klansmen also inadvertently draws amazing parallels considering that it couldn't have known,0.0020255353
this was going to happen between the hate speech film The Birth of a Nation,0.21749829
which was allowed at the time to become a national mainstream blockbuster and this movie,0.061688315
even points out that a plate at the White House it contrasts that again inadvertently,0.10932453
with the story this week that several digital distributors have decided to stop carrying Infowars,0.059612256
because they feel it qualifies as hate speech and the contrast between stepping in and,0.15101144
stopping something and not stepping in and stopping it and what it does to society,0.109686166
as a whole it's really interesting stuff and by the way I've never actually seen,0.084512115
the birth of a nation of course I'm familiar with it but they show chunks,0.15081586
significant chunks of the movie here and it is something something truly awful and shocking,0.18476552
to see now our this month it was James Baldwin's birthday which was promoted very,0.07273258
heavily this year because moonlights Barry Jenkins has his own Oscar contender coming up which,0.08435225
is based on Baldwin's novel so there there was a an incentivized push to celebrate,0.09746625
Baldwin's birthday and to get his name out there that I think that that film,0.14841676
will probably be more Oscar friendly for the reasons I'm about to outline but there,0.04270306
was an amazing quote from Baldwin which I came across that day which was I,0.07424988
imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they,0.2966643
sense once hate is gone they will be forced to deal with pain and that,0.19728775
is an amazing very astute quote and a nuance that I think this movie misses,0.09037022
it's KKK members are as much caricatures as the disgusting characters and the caricatures and,0.53490317
the birth of a nation rather than really exploring what creates a hate so great,0.41948003
that someone couldn't stand even be touched by someone of a different race or religion,0.35656086
and would actually take great joy in their torture and death and so in a,0.6693492
lot of ways black clansmen is I would say preaching to the choir and breaks,0.1151199
little new ground and exploring something that's been a dirty horrifying secret in America since,0.69542736
its inception I mean I guess it explores it and explores it in new ways,0.123539075
but it doesn't break new ground it's like it's a it's a different way to,0.07653193
have a discussion we've already been having to me the most unique thing about black,0.2946761
Klansmen is that while it juxtaposes very effectively white and black power extremist groups at,0.19156232
the heart of the story is a black moderate wrong Stallworth and the white moderates,0.15300846
who work with him at the Colorado Springs Police Department which with the exception of,0.033550635
one or two unsavory characters seems like an amazing place to work like these are,0.2521904
a great group of guys and that moderate viewpoint unusual for Hollywood I think will,0.08404032
be a welcome change for many and perhaps maybe we'll get a couple of people,0.05394608
outside of the choir to watch and consider this film now I could watch this,0.05445808
film all day long thanks to John David Washington's Ron Stallworth I mean the promotion,0.08796499
for this movie has not done his performance justice it is something worthy of a,0.09173733
Coen Brothers movie the movie itself is not though side note this whole thing Spike,0.11206453
Lee borrows heavily from the Coen brothers but he never turns it up to an,0.08215309
11 an absurdity shock value or high art as the Coen brothers do so well,0.19222243
where you're like damn that is weird and crazy beautiful and this comes close a,0.58583015
couple of times I think that Spike Lee felt the absurdity of the situation would,0.22385979
do that but again this is a conversation we've been having very intently for the,0.048105426
you know the past couple of years now again and so I think that that,0.054387283
those qualities aren't quite there the way that maybe he had hoped but could have,0.12253454
been if I think he'd been a little bit bolder from an artistic perspective but,0.15486455
I also think it's great that while John David washing denzel's son he is very,0.123565376
much his own actor and doesn't try to capitalize on any of his father's signature,0.21860145
moves they say you would never guess they were related but they are both very,0.065130405
talented and while I didn't think much of him as an actor before this movie,0.14259109
I'd seen him on like one or two episodes of ballers and I wasn't impressed,0.118977875
with the whole thing quite frankly but now I think he should be on every,0.093825504
casting shortlist and I'm very excited to see him again shortly and Robert Redford's the,0.16125454
old man in the gun where he plays another police officer actually our detective I,0.2106923
think in that film now the rest of the cast does a very nice job,0.0631219
in addition with a few standouts and then also a couple people who sucked but,0.6648363
let's talk about the good people first so Adam driver gives an understated but powerful,0.08846328
performance as a jewish detective who has to come to terms with having past you,0.33075732
know past most of his life and coming you know something that he hadn't even,0.18302631
considered laura hair is very likable as an unwavering member of the Black Power movement,0.106914364
even to a fault which I thought was very brave of the movie to also,0.11353389
explore Corey Hawkins anchors a very compelling and moving sequence of a rally where he,0.06930618
speaks as a black panther member Kwame Toure the way like Spike Lee that was,0.1525401
really great like the way he would focus on black faces in the crowd being,0.31089434
moved by the words of Kwame Toure that was pretty neat stuff there was one,0.101099774
of the better I think maybe more artistic moments of the movie and then Harry,0.080658436
Belafonte has an unforgettable scene where you actually believe he lives he lived the story,0.088475324
he's telling and finally in the good category Ken ggarrido plays the best police boss,0.45363054
you could ever ask for such a sweetheart but like he still seemed like a,0.10053694
realistic member of the police department I loved him I was like that guy so,0.3154607
great and as for the actors who didn't quite work out Alec Baldwin practically embarrassed,0.19911313
himself I feel he did embarrass himself and a small supposedly comedic cameo at the,0.27999163
beginning of the film that's just a mess it does Network I even feel maybe,0.11162613
it should've been cut Nicholas Turturro I know he's a spike Lee favorite but he,0.18965454
is the least convincing KKK I've ever seen I'd be like that guy wouldn't be,0.31089434
welcomed by the KKK what and then while Paul Walter Hauser is very funny as,0.24057078
another KKK member interestingly building off his eye Tania performance last year he stands out,0.4489993
in both movies but he Jasper poq Onan and Ashley Atkinson are also clownish in,0.5876557
their performances and not I would say in an effective way so while I found,0.102760114
black Klansmen extremely entertaining and powerful featuring some stellar performances I think it's just shy,0.09383577
of greatness so I don't see it going the distance in terms of awards season,0.0366699
I can maybe see it getting some nominations it's because of the subject matter Spike,0.11695528
Lee you know Jason Blum Perdue Jason Blum and Jordan Peele producing behind the scenes,0.07668194
it's an attractive package but it just you know again as I said it doesn't,0.096438594
go the distance it's just shy of greatness as an awards film is like a,0.09871933
film for the for the ages but as a piece of entertainment and a way,0.10648768
to spend two-plus hours of your time it's great I would actually put it along,0.18907623
the lines of like really great television you know like along like better call Saul,0.08826596
or something or Breaking Bad or something like that or Fargo you know based of,0.23865174
course on the Coen brothers work it has that quality to it but for a,0.042595405
movie and even I think even for us to tell standout television show again just,0.050778463
misses the mark just misses it it certainly gave me a lot to think about,0.079635024
though maybe and hopefully you know again preaching to the choir but I hope it,0.06880021
reaches a couple of people as well so anyway that's my review of black Klansmen,0.43305862
I'd be very curious to hear your thoughts down below don't put any spoilers in,0.19504024
or at least if you have a spoiler market is such because I think there,0.065875374
are a couple of interesting twists and turns in the film now I guess finally,0.033553302
you might be like why don't you mention Topher Grace grace and actually when I,0.18462907
was at the press screening someone said another member of the press was like oh,0.058831193
I heard people saying Topher Grace should get nominated for an Oscar like maybe just,0.07051121
because he was willing to play David Duke but I don't think that's fair cuz,0.1487699
I don't think his per he's just Topher Grace and a wig and he's like,0.20794687
oh a mustache like he's it's hair acting right like he he said he did,0.48685068
a lot of research for the role but I didn't see it I think that,0.025108185
he's actually one of the least effective like he like Topher Grace talking about this,0.15017086
character said he was surprised looking at old footage of David Duke how effective he,0.096615784
was and maybe making people think what he was saying wasn't horrible so I didn't,0.14866397
see that with Topher Grace I just saw Topher Grace so I think that another,0.06186625
actor maybe would have been able to get that disturbing quality across that gray zone,0.26988438
if you will all right so write your thoughts down below and of course as,0.26042783
