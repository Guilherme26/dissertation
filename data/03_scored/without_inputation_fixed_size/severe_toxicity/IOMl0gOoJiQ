after waiting for two solid years to finally see the next chapter in the Star,0.023511581
Wars saga this is what Lucasfilm gave us now the real question is has Disney,0.021998953
ruined Star Wars I faith that's the question that all of us fans are asking,0.07667439
right now and at the end of this video I will answer that question so,0.045681488
let's go ahead and talk about the good the bad and the really bad so,0.03778642
a reloj is real its cannon tell you guys the truth I think reloj was,0.086295605
my favorite part of this whole entire movie I asked Lee loved how they were,0.05569782
communiqu√© for the force and their little conversations that they had with each other I,0.040748484
thought that was really well done and there was so much like almost like sexual,0.26845333
tension between the two of them and you could just like really feel their chemistry,0.057169873
and I think that part was really well done I also really loved the throne,0.02810401
room scene and I think that that whole part was played out really well I,0.03991634
like how kylo and Rey teamed up together against the Red Guards I also like,0.07304315
at the beginning when Rey shows up and really feels like that they're still good,0.025543718
and Ben solo obviously and she you know is trying to convince him that you,0.022067467
know he's still good inside I really feel like that Rey and kylo had this,0.047428258
Anakin and Padme moment at that part it really reminds me of Revenge of the,0.035014603
Sith had my actions conversation the last conversation they ever had together and it really,0.031874936
just reminded me of that part I wanted to talk about was the porks I,0.037540305
really loved the porks they were hysterical and they were just so adorable I also,0.104269534
loved the parts of Chewbacca and the porks it was really cute when she Baca,0.13672385
was going to go and eat one of the porks cooked and all the porks,0.16582562
were looking at him and they were kind of like crying and whining about it,0.10851008
and Chewbacca like out that very moment became like vegan I love how he took,0.053186756
all of the porks and and put them on the ship and how he was,0.13002877
just kind of like a crazy pork lady how evolved in your characters I have,0.1864909
to say rose and Paige were the two who stood out the most to me,0.035133004
I really wish that they would have had a bigger part in this whole movie,0.033732794
and I think Paige died way too quick it was a really emotional you know,0.13048309
the way she sacrificed herself but we didn't even get to know this character she,0.0542863
was just kind of there and gone and that kind of sad me I gave,0.03129157
love rose to I really like throws she was probably the best a new character,0.031501766
out of all and I really just want so much more rows and we're depth,0.03203724
to her character and to just learn more about her and we really didn't learn,0.019119374
too much stuff about rows and that kind of bothered me because I felt like,0.050286554
she deserved to have more depth to her character so now let's get on to,0.06508024
the bad so one of my biggest problems of this movie was that there were,0.058235496
way too many characters and there just wasn't enough time nor story to really present,0.017453754
all these characters to us correctly they introduced way too many new ones who were,0.032079812
completely unnecessary like Laura Dern's character like nothing against these actors or actresses but her,0.041966435
character was so unnecessary and DJ the character he was just there was no point,0.015028494
to him they're literally wishes no sense either one of their characters I really feel,0.049597424
like that they should had been the movie I just feel like that they just,0.03937754
took up way too much time and these these older characters that we got to,0.017516281
meet in the force awakens we literally just met these characters two years ago this,0.023045287
is the second chapter and the sequel trilogy and we still barely even know anything,0.03693033
about these characters we hardly know if we bought PO we hardly know if he,0.027506009
bought fed we absolutely don't really have a clue who write even is and now,0.029275397
they're already showing us introducing us these new characters but you guys haven't even effort,0.03590728
the characters that have already been previously written and it just drives me nuts because,0.10916329
I only know so much more about these characters I'm so excited to see these,0.040699262
characters just grow and to really get to know them on a whole new different,0.014695902
level like we have in the past Star Wars movies and here I just feel,0.019986108
like that all the older characters have just gone the boo and moved to decide,0.028207112
for these new characters and then there's a storyline I the whole storyline is just,0.012019869
really all over the place it's really weak it really has no point chia-wei it,0.050280567
can't feel like that the resistance is just sitting around in their spaceship and they're,0.037166473
just crying and whining about how to force the first eye don't speak because I'm,0.08505903
I'm still flustered by this whole entire thing anyway there's really no point of this,0.040544275
storyline it just drags on and on and on so now let's move on to,0.037785757
Luke so we eat wave for two years to see what's great to happen between,0.032220166
ray and Luke when ray gives Luke his old lightsaber and guess what Luke does,0.028796466
he just froze over his shoulder and he's just like yeah okay whatever screwless I,0.32625377
don't know who you are I'm done I don't want this thing yeah see you,0.11533486
later go to hell I'm done type of attitude and it was just so ridiculous,0.46615827
I don't know if it was made to be sunny but when he heard a,0.017014068
lightsaber I was just like are you serious like opening one gave you that lightsaber,0.034672033
like if that was your dad's lightsaber that lightsaber has seemed sooo much just crazy,0.25555345
stuff and it should mean so much to Luke and he just threw it away,0.05591334
like it just meant absolutely nothing to him and another fee that really bothered me,0.027048362
was that Luke like abandoned layi it was like Leia SH trying to hold together,0.1354673
the resistance and you know Hans gone Ben's turned to the dark side Luke has,0.030188695
just completely ran away and Leia is out here the only one who's like trying,0.037725892
to make things right and trying to you know just she's the one who's trying,0.036883768
to make any effort and Luke just kind of like abandoned her and like I,0.01679123
know like he was going to like frickin kill her son and he's really ashamed,0.78126746
of that and he's like probably felt like he could face her but it's like,0.109815836
like it was there for you what you were going through how's Luke like I,0.03456627
just that really upset me because I feel like Luke would have never have like,0.013014983
a banded leia like that next thing is yeah Luke never really trained right right,0.07705753
how absolutely like no training whatsoever and that was one of the things I was,0.03316872
really looking forward to this movie was Luke training right and there was like absolutely,0.02783195
no training and I just saw you understand how how stiva call away with doing,0.046141792
that Rey was already like relief for sensitive she could like do all this stuff,0.028545026
everyone saying she's like a Mary Sue and I thought oh you know next movie,0.030023064
you know like lukla train her and she'll becoming more powerful and like Luke does,0.023933308
even really trainer none of that really happens as I kind of wanted maybe like,0.01633558
a light saber fight between Luke and Rey and them like training and we didn't,0.0150657445
really even get that and that was really disappointing and I just feel like that,0.029617967
whole part was just so overlooked and you know that whole part where Luke is,0.0072638053
like this is a good go the way you think it is yeah I kind,0.060854327
of feel like Luke was saying that to everyone in the audience at the movie,0.011187059
theater like it was just so polite anyway he said that and we're all sitting,0.02201758
there it's like at this this whole movie has not gone the way we thought,0.023773663
it was going to go okay so now we're going to dive into the really,0.050206732
bad so one of the things that really really irked me was Finn's character I,0.04592428
love Finn he was really also force awakens but Ike I just feel like that,0.04352895
Dave just kind of turned Finn into just kind of a useless idiot and he,0.6835081
has so much potential and everyone has just been calling him to space janitor and,0.042521864
I just think that's so sad I don't think Lucasfilm even knows what to do,0.034613498
of his character I feel like Poe was just running around like a chicken with,0.07395578
its head cut off I just feel like that his character was so all over,0.20715947
the place and knowing that this was Carrie Fisher's last Star Wars movie uh it,0.022458596
it just really really makes me sad to tell you guys the God's honest truth,0.034650747
and the whole part when the ship blows up and leg gets blown out and,0.23301144
she's kind of flowing through space and then we all think oh my gosh you,0.15422349
know it's just how they're going to kill Carrie Fisher off and then you know,0.45554054
she opens her eyes or whatever and she uses the force to go to the,0.06472902
other ship and they rescue her and save her I really don't know how to,0.05629316
feel about that part when it first happened I was really pissed like okay like,0.09083482
is this how you know this is how Leia is going to die and then,0.31580275
you know she survives for the rest of the movie but I still just don't,0.026064556
know how to feel about that part and of course Captain phasma we thought that,0.10164605
she'd get a bigger part in this movie as we were all hoping and praying,0.06369533
for and fast mom was treed even worse in this movie than she was in,0.1078429
the previous movie she was killed off which really really upset me she was such,0.27817494
a awesome character and she died so it was just so poorly put together how,0.039883748
she died and you know maybe she's not really dead maybe she's gonna pop back,0.27719077
up into the next movie but again they just they just treated her like garbage,0.42450708
and they kind of just cast her aside like they did in force awakens and,0.09638644
one of the most shocking deaths and movie would have to be Snoke I really,0.10765199
have no idea why the heck they killed Snoke off we had absolutely no idea,0.42518544
who he was where he came from why he was so strong with the force,0.03229533
when it's a train Ben solo it really just made absolutely no sense and again,0.03449709
Snoke seems like such a necessary character and he was killed off so quickly it,0.3421763
was ridiculous and I would probably we will probably never even know who he was,0.17673597
or why he was doing these things they also hinted at the gray Jedi and,0.032095112
that just kind never came about either and I guess that they just completely forgot,0.022920232
about the Knights of Ren which they teased in the force awakens and Rey's vision,0.020165043
I have no idea what happened to those guys they were never mentioned again they,0.07636973
kind of just disappeared and that really shocked being that they kept that really important,0.03058714
plot line out the whole part when Rey and kylo are talking and race says,0.08371336
that she saw his future which we never got a glimpse into that I think,0.11148611
it would be cool if we could have seen kylos future a little bit for,0.07633049
Ray's eyes but of course they just decided to skip over that too and then,0.033037677
the part where kylo tells right you know I know who your parents are they,0.026374532
sold you for drinking money and he's like you know the truth of race like,0.13219461
yeah I know the truth and I personally feel like that Kyla was biessing ray,0.07856218
I really feel like he was lying to her and trying to throw her off,0.20499828
and making her feel like she was a nobody but I really don't think that,0.083135985
that's the actually truth of her parents I think that they were trying to throw,0.101457804
all of us fans off and save it for the big finale for episode 9,0.025426645
the one really emotional part of the story was that both ray and kylo both,0.01293117
feel abandoned and alone and I think that they both could really relate to each,0.0070223436
other on that level and when kylo says you know you're a nobody but you,0.3339766
know you mean something to me that type of thing you could just really see,0.029888697
how they're both are hurting so much and how that's stuffy that draws them together,0.13494249
because they both have experienced that pain it really is disappointing that there was a,0.035760272
proper lightsaber battle I really wanted there to be a showdown between kylo and Luke,0.042386167
I really just wanted them to just see them fight it out and to just,0.088252574
have this really epic lightsaber battle and we really did not kept that we got,0.018130912
the Luke force per jet projection thing I cannot pronounce words today I am sorry,0.022132656
I and that's pretty much what we got and it was really interesting moment it,0.030070292
was really different for me feel so you've seen before we never knew that this,0.030036367
power existed that Luke could do this but still I just kind of wanted a,0.008991287
traditional lightsaber battle in place of that again it was no casing it was enjoyable,0.045515858
and yeah so probably the most iconic death of this movie would be Luke Skywalker,0.1425615
I kind of had a feeling bites him the end of the movie that he,0.13167377
would turn into a force ghost and he would disappear just like how obi-wan did,0.262294
and of course that was the case I got super emotional at that moment I,0.021055058
know my mom was really super emotional too you know to see Luke Skywalker born,0.047718946
on screen and then to see him die on screen it was a very emotional,0.17123356
moment just seeing his life of the character and stuff and knowing that he has,0.024849266
passed and of course he's going to show up in Episode nine as a force,0.05076881
ghost we all know that he'll be back but again it was still really interesting,0.044622514
seeing the two suns setting and it wishes a very emotional moment now finally has,0.020793641
Disney ruined Star Wars personally I don't think that they've ruined the whole franchise I,0.043782387
think that they've just really screwed up with this movie again glass Jedi it's not,0.10355313
a bad movie but it's not exactly a good movie however and I would have,0.063978694
to admit that this is my least favorite Star Wars movie out of all of,0.037091304
them yes I would have to say I prefer to film Menace over the last,0.067091085
Jedi but I don't know maybe as time passes and I watch - Jedi a,0.021724898
few more times it may end up really growing on me when I first saw,0.055528864
the force awakens I absolutely hated that movie and after giving me a second chance,0.060725946
and watching it a few more times is now one of my favorite Star Wars,0.027206676
movies so maybe the last Jedi will grow on all of us and we will,0.062327042
look at it be more positive about it but I really think that Lucasfilm really,0.017514285
needs to take a step back and think again before giving Rian Johnson you know,0.08894104
giving him his own trilogy to work on I don't want to blame Ryan for,0.04246399
the whole entire movie because it seems more like the script in the writing of,0.017918717
the story seemed to be more of the problem than the directing was so maybe,0.023167016
Ryan was at fault at all it was just the writers and stuff but at,0.022630213
