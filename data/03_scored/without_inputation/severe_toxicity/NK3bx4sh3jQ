eighth grade is a new film by Bo Burnham and as hacia absolutely gorgeous movie,0.032258745
that really captures the essence an awkwardness of being a teenager in middle school but,0.032195553
unlike any movie have ever done before most quiet tale of day I don't talk,0.0272559
about at school but if people talk to me and stuff they'd find out that,0.041536726
I'm like really funny and cool and talking by the way I like your shirt,0.057884946
a lot like so cool so there have been a plethora of like high school,0.060697343
movies and all of varying degrees of success and that there really aren't that many,0.01017598
for you know middle school and there are some that maybe have character set in,0.01086644
it but it's not really about life in that time and that's what this is,0.020722466
all about this is like a week in this the last week in this girl's,0.095827684
life of eighth grade well as she's getting ready to graduate grade and getting ready,0.073781505
to move on to high school and this character is portrayed so excellently by isla,0.08792531
Fisher that's just it feels so real that it's incredible I mean you'll know like,0.020967254
I mean if every bit of it it feels so real and it feels so,0.042783946
awkward at times I feel it feels scary at time it feels like if funny,0.07043031
at times if so well crafted by a bo burnham and mainly his first movie,0.076440245
and he's directing and writing it and really he got his vision on the screen,0.057807785
so perfectly and I really again the from a 24 they let him do whatever,0.036555167
he wanted like I've read some some interviews with him talking about the process and,0.035489544
but he's like a you know he he wanted to get your real eighth-graders he,0.13039462
want to have you know 13 year-olds on screen and you know because he wanted,0.06337404
to be real we didn't want some 20 year old playing them and even though,0.053629767
when you have a 13 year old you have to work around the child laws,0.121427275
like he's only filmed for egg nine of the day or something like that I'm,0.093247436
sure you also have to have liked to have had that I think they have,0.030460754
to have like schooling for them to like so I mean they have a lot,0.041170876
of complications with doing this but he it was so much so worth the end,0.054065462
product that you know it's just amazing that he was able to to do this,0.03747445
in the first film finally Fisher plays Kayla and she is again an eighth grader,0.03935825
and she is kind of an introvert but she wants to be you know popular,0.110948645
she wants to hang out with everyone but you know she has a lot of,0.22550735
anxiety but like she does these YouTube videos in their bedroom and they I when,0.0934583
I first saw the trailers I'm a little worried about how they would incorporate the,0.023927987
YouTube videos into the movie but the he does it really masterfully because essentially when,0.079566605
she's going through these events in her life she's going to like her first pool,0.074485935
party or she's meeting up with older kids from the high school that she met,0.056216665
when she was shadowing the one at the mall and there's a lot of different,0.032844774
things that she does and you see like almost like the video kind of playing,0.036594413
like you see in the background there like along with what's going on in present,0.0229648
day and like you see her like almost talking to herself like she the video,0.08430404
was like her giving advice to other people about things but really giving advice to,0.009244722
herself and they she sometimes unable to take her own advice and if it provides,0.04009993
like an inner monologue to because a lot of times stuff to do like and,0.0459908
not be obtrusive and a movie but this is so well crafted that it just,0.02694659
is perfect for it and like you see these moments that like the other kids,0.05915811
like the popular kids I really mean to her and like they're all it's so,0.03553012
well done especially I love because I'm like a lot some she's like it is,0.051306944
a modern take like even at the same time though I mean if you're me,0.03965492
like if you're a guy you still I think relate to her and if you,0.074950896
were like a 7 year old woman I think you'll still relate to her you,0.100015685
know even though you didn't have to deal with the social media and the phones,0.01860186
yes and I think that some of the stuff in this movie could be outdated,0.048358187
after a fear of time but I've seen because like oh it'll live in this,0.05322733
moment and I'll it's like preserving this moment forever and like I love that theme,0.017968606
when she's on the phone or on the laptop like you know in movies most,0.026715105
the time screen images are stimulated because they can do weird things with the lighting,0.054027546
you know from but you know when he was making this he wanted that glow,0.02601001
you get if you ever see if you like if you ever looked at someone,0.078492336
like looking at a phone and darkness like there's this glow that kind of like,0.026820205
envelops their face and this like almost kind of like an eerie sort of glow,0.18482527
but it's it's kind of cool though and like there's no way to get that,0.017642666
without actually having her like have a phone up to her face and you know,0.10795199
when they do that they like she's on Instagram she's on the different sing than,0.023949271
they they made like fake Instagram accounts like I did to make it real to,0.056546595
make it like she's they all these kids are real and you see her like,0.033639666
she has a crush on this hot hot popular guy and like every time they,0.18771881
do that they play this like techno music that if it's really I mean that,0.025538396
it's almost like it's objectifying this kid but I mean that's you know it's all,0.05355194
from her eye her her viewpoint and like the score as a whole is really,0.073653124
grex hland they throughout the movie I loved the score but you know you get,0.026049921
this character like she is trying to deal with things than she's trying to like,0.06025832
and I've also there's a lot of hormones and I think another movie another director,0.047899876
may have like tried to stay away from some of that stuff however in doing,0.034004852
so it would kind of lose the reality of of that of the time like,0.04377108
when you're that old like their hormones are raging even though like you get really,0.104762435
really awkward like you have those hormones and like eoq because you don't know what's,0.124200426
exactly going on and there's some really funny and some cringy moments from this well,0.08363554
probably won my favor most of the whole movie with the girl a banana and,0.1674999
the dad coming in and like because she doesn't she hates bananas but she is,0.17914926
she was going to try to try out something on the banana but it's like,0.12537713
so funny and awkward and I really think Josh Hamilton adds the dad he was,0.054758582
amazing like I I hope that he gets a nominated for you know Supporting Actor,0.07327863
because he is so perfect like I mean so awkward to be the key of,0.12845096
the single parents raising a daughter and he doesn't know exactly what's going on but,0.048894323
he wants to be there to help her and like this somebody who's like funny,0.05418054
behalf of horrible moments with them and like I he was always kind of there,0.08584528
for but like also same time like she doesn't want him to be there they,0.03794939
really tackled that relationship so well yeah that that awkward with like she's on the,0.1152118
phone then she just wants to be on the phone and there's a lot of,0.018624477
stuff that is if funny it's a good movie of Washington Cedars because there's so,0.0587876
many different moments that like people will have different reactions to it like it's a,0.025738616
very vocal crowd like cringing or good oh my god like in some scenes and,0.09532348
laughing some laugh like I know live a group a group of girls behind me,0.31362462
laughing really loud like it's some serious some see some sequences and there are like,0.01825663
and there are some things that you know there are some nuts throwing things but,0.10231389
there are some scary sort of moments at one point and in those moments another,0.02115683
movie may go over the top with it or make it like they go too,0.022832429
far but this one it doesn't go far all but then like it's still impactful,0.033094883
to the character you know horrific ly like it's really an interesting take on like,0.061796892
something that can happen like that and that I mean I don't know if ever,0.045551777
seen anything quite like it but if this so like really a horrible moment but,0.06418955
you know you almost don't want to watch like if it's how no it's tough,0.03502059
to describe without like it's boiling icing yeah but it's really just such an amazing,0.046428487
movie there does so many interesting things throughout the whole length and I mean there's,0.01260257
a lot here and it's just like you keep wanting to go with it you,0.10618526
want to see where happen what happens to how what ends up with her character,0.028132612
but then like you also don't want to know like you wanted to let her,0.036186654
have the experience of moments herself so I'm like you want to have her the,0.035542756
camera follow every moment but I really liked everything that this movie did I'm just,0.03301905
so glad that I took a little bit of a road trip to see this,0.047838014
like it wasn't playing in her around me I know like this past week they,0.058972523
upped it to like a hundred theaters but I was actually able to go like,0.016956862
one in State College the theater had there had it like an hour away so,0.024722215
we made the trip and saw that and gotten got some steak afterwards so I,0.016362187
mean it was a great movie to see you well worth the trip so if,0.05411668
you have it look around them Fandango so if you would feel like the nearest,0.19884534
theater that's playing it like it's worth making a trip to go see like we,0.031026825
have essentially support a movie like this and then the film that is so powerful,0.02263753
and so it's so well crafted I I can't wait to see what Burnham does,0.044166863
next this is an amazing film and I would highly recommend it I probably give,0.024381641
it like a nine point seven five out of ten maybe even the ten out,0.050108284
of ten now if I have to see if then one would be like to,0.025503807
watch it again but I don't know if you'll have the same impact like in,0.040416557
repeated viewings but I loved it and if you can go see it you really,0.036689535
shouldn't go see it but thanks for watching and if you got every place on,0.024430865
my head or the scratch me on that see over there and you know if,0.06505828
