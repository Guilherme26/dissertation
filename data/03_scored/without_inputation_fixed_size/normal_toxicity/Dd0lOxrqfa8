we know they're amazing because we've seen them in other things before they have been,0.06662243
good individually as co-stars on other films kaitlyn dever the spectacular now short term 12,0.06817188
beautiful boys she has been in many of films this for me is her best,0.19866163
performance and then her best friend beanie Betty is a beanie Feldstein I know her,0.10035866
from Lady Bird and she was a standout in that film she played the best,0.08766868
friend character and she was fantastic in this film she gets more of a lead,0.10477263
role even though she's play the best friend character a very similar character but different,0.021264264
in its own way and the riding for this movie is spectacular the dialogue the,0.059355713
script it is so tight I never felt as if anything on the screen was,0.08787441
boring me because even though this is a slightly conventional concept like I said it,0.1797373
kind of runs off of movies and stories that we have seen before but it's,0.060155716
a coming-of-age story what more can you do other than these two guys these two,0.09925348
girls these two best friends go out for one night it's one night of trouble,0.40330613
there gonna be something that they've never been before they're going to break away from,0.116003625
what they're known as and known for and it usually falls on either the final,0.052525327
day of high school or the first day of high school and this falls on,0.1440282
their graduation or pre graduation night so yes it's leaning on those tropes to get,0.11695338
the audience in but once you're in it does not lean on those tropes from,0.11027347
a narrative perspective it does things it subverts expectations to a degree that you're gonna,0.15360232
walk out having had a really great time but then you're gonna think about it,0.15369698
and think about how much you enjoy these characters together think about the chemistry think,0.08099481
about the relationships and think about how it makes you feel and how it throws,0.08948395
you back to your days as a high schooler it really threw me back I'm,0.31089434
only 23 so I just graduate it's it's been a while now but while I,0.07302839
was watching it really put me back in that situation it made me rethink some,0.090816684
things in my past was I really doing the thing that I should have been,0.045435455
doing in high school did I break away and be the person that I should,0.30315918
have been this film this silly little movie called book-smart that has really dirty hardcore,0.73547995
laughs in there and some people will see it as well those are just nonsensical,0.2889324
jokes directed towards teenagers and it's basically potty humor but I found the humor charming,0.13492528
and it felt like it fit none of it felt forced there were one or,0.07944106
two jokes that did not make me laugh and a few moments that fell flat,0.10134483
from a humorous standpoint but I was so locked into the characters I did not,0.08647821
care I was all in a majority of the jokes and these two friends their,0.06782251
chemistry just carries the entire movie I'm not gonna say on their shoulders because once,0.097789675
again the direction the writing every thing was really good but you're in it for,0.071881026
their relationship and you care when they have their quarrels and conversations and discussions and,0.11331285
thoughts on the meaning of life everything you're invested because they have built you up,0.073791444
to the point and delivered on every note so far and by the end of,0.068218336
the film like I said I walked out having had a great time but I,0.062198926
was thinking you know there were some moments where I wasn't laughing as much as,0.07823773
I should have been laughing but I just thought about the relationship between the characters,0.07299291
and how it felt so much like high school and it wasn't casting 27 and,0.09451234
28 year olds as high schoolers even though some of these guys were clearly a,0.11244545
bit older you still had actors who looked like they were in high school a,0.34840888
really talented supporting cast by the way I recognize multiple people from multiple other movies,0.067601986
the teachers included of course you have like Jason Sudeikis and Lisa Kudrow and Will,0.059717994
Forte and Billie lourd who plays a crazy character in this movie of course Billie,0.54083085
lourd is Carrie Fisher's daughter we've seen her pop up in Star Wars and it's,0.061378907
super minor role and she's been on television shows but she is spontaneous and crazy,0.5820913
and this ongoing gag in this movie that is hilarious and that's the thing I'll,0.12851448
say about this film even if you're not having the best most incredible time in,0.12834328
the theater while you're watching it there are gags that start out at the beginning,0.09652335
of this movie and carry through do not get annoying and pay off at the,0.1224671
end I spotted three or four things in there that they set something up and,0.075208336
then they pay that off at the end of the film all of the character,0.086113155
arcs all the story lines they all come to fruition and they end off as,0.06968833
you expect a bit of a predictable nature but as you expect in the best,0.31089434
way and it encapsulates what it means to grow up it really is a great,0.0847616
coming-of-age story in that regard it reminded me of 8th grade last year with like,0.06515708
I said those super bad elements the over-the-top humor the zany characters the wacky things,0.28738523
that they get themselves into all of those things were awesome and yeah guys I,0.07979599
can just keep talking about this movie I'm definitely doing that on my letterbox page,0.16153646
when I log that for review later on tonight but right now I have to,0.042859495
give this thing a score like I said it's not a perfect film I did,0.14985289
have a few nitpicks and issues here and there and maybe one or two things,0.09925902
felt shoehorned not the political nature of the movie that was one thing that I,0.10156091
was a bit afraid of going in like I don't want to be hit in,0.1893459
the face with certain elements and themes but now they didn't do that they were,0.08751388
just there to make you laugh and Olivia Wilde made sure of that by the,0.17888384
way her directing in this film cinematography everything to look the feel the relationships great,0.10274742
