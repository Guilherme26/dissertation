now that's I do a Star Wars movie hi guys welcome to my name is,0.08215994
Kendall anyway it's finally time it's the most anticipated movie of 2017 Star Wars the,0.044378795
last Jedi so many people were hyped for this myself included because it's Star Wars,0.10039606
how could you not be excited for Star Wars this one is the most iconic,0.15272474
franchise of all time so let's get this ball rolling so the last Jedi takes,0.09127745
place right after the force awakens and rain has found Luke Skywalker he's been in,0.08409228
hiding for so long because he feels bad then he turned kylo Ren aka Ben,0.24243504
solo over to the dark side and he wasn't able to save him and ray,0.24014969
wants to learn the ways of the force he's trying to get Luke to teach,0.1144814
her those things but he's like it I'm done I don't want anything to do,0.23960541
with the force anymore I'm just gonna live in my little Hut doing my own,0.1620324
thing and meanwhile on the other side of the galaxy the resistance is being tracked,0.0757882
down by the first order who really really want to kill them they have them,0.799327
corner so you have like lay up pull Finn they're all trying to figure out,0.16789481
how to escape him and thus we have a pretty excellent movie like I said,0.10509918
I was really high for this movie but I wouldn't go as far saying it,0.109359734
I was in like my most anticipated movies of the year that was that went,0.06180202
to like Blade Runner and Dunkirk to war for the pond apes because I I,0.31089434
knew this was gonna be good it's a post George Lucas Star Wars movie I,0.106944084
mean come on it's not without its flaws but I still loved it nonetheless what,0.15187226
really works in this movie is the characters and the character motivations that was kind,0.047356747
of the problem with the prequels is that though all the character motivations were a,0.06039595
little bit muddled they didn't really know what characters wanted to do what they were,0.15354736
thinking you didn't really feel like you got in the minds of the main characters,0.12057473
and now with the sequels you know that's not the case these characters are much,0.07872424
better fleshed out than George Lucas ever could have done ray gets a lot more,0.09666227
attention in this movie the character grows even more so than she did in the,0.09518693
force awakens rey and Johnson's direction this movie is it is awesome this film is,0.06185875
not quite as fast-paced as a force awakens as if you remember that everybody just,0.08045921
flew by this one's a little slower it kind of takes a little bit time,0.12036166
to sit the story aside and it's more filled in with the characters than anything,0.07916666
else so if you go in expecting the lightning fast Aysen force awakens and you're,0.09332468
gonna be disappointed because that's not here with the last Jedi this is a lot,0.0810341
more of a somber slower paced film yeah actually which is across the board a,0.066753365
fan-fucking-tastic it's it's Star Wars movie come on let's say that's the one thing at,0.8606264
least it has to get right no all the Star Wars movies even the bad,0.10143187
ones have at least one good one or two great action sequences Adam driver once,0.065998584
again is perfect as kylo Ren this time around kylo is a little bit more,0.24123779
conflicted you saw after when he got his ass handed to him by Rey in,0.9304842
the previous movies a little bit more shaken up this time and this he's got,0.11099906
like this is cool badass like scar across his face it's like that's that's a,0.5876557
true villain right there alright so a driver was like a virtual nobody before like,0.26740462
2015 now he's like considered one of the bigger stars working today rightfully so cuz,0.06504345
he is a damn good actor there's a couple scenes between kylo array where they're,0.620113
kind of for having this force connection and they're talking to each other even though,0.11248222
they're light-years apart and those are some of the best moments of the movie cuz,0.07648476
it really allowed these two characters to grow and allowed their conflict between them to,0.10220842
grow as well by far the best performance in saira movie with the Mark Hamill,0.07442797
as Luke Skywalker this is by far his best on-screen performance that we've seen from,0.077861585
him but we plays looking this is it's a very weathered old man a man,0.33641168
who is truly deeply troubled by his past mistakes and you could tell that Mark,0.107075505
Hamill had a great time playing and reprising this role for the first time in,0.07893922
over 30 years and there's also a lot of really really touching moments with Luke,0.06790421
so be on the lookout for those as well I'm sorry I'm just I'm trying,0.06317245
my best not to spoil this movie cuz the nice I just want any I,0.1515563
just want to get up and talk about I just want to spoil the show,0.059620913
this but I gotta be I gotta be the professional I gotta be reasonable like,0.082604
I said this movie is not perfect it's got its flaws and this is probably,0.09601733
the most polarizing Star Wars film to date some people would argue that was rogue,0.23664777
one but no blast tonight is way more polarizing than Rome 1 there are things,0.078804
that rien Donson does in this way where he takes chances and some of these,0.05739946
chances are cool man they are pretty heavy and I think not everybody is gonna,0.3342077
appreciate it so that's why I like some people now are kind of on it,0.095335834
because they don't like some of the changes because it doesn't feel like a standard,0.07620467
traditional Star Wars movie and I got some to say about that I got a,0.07080462
whole video coming up but I'm the saying like for the most part the things,0.11655861
that he changed the new that he brought to the table really worked and it,0.057950262
really drove the story and it really added a lot to certain characters but some,0.025202937
things that he took in a different direction that were really unnecessary like for instance,0.081414565
I'll do my best not to spoil this but there is a little scene that,0.07505491
happens in this movie that I understand why they wanted to put in there I,0.09251427
commend them for trying something different but it is cheesy it is stupid and you,0.84248734
take it out of the movie and it really doesn't change whatsoever you probably say,0.07165734
that they had it in there for some like some heavy weighted drama but honestly,0.101639464
it was pretty pretty cheap it's got some editing issues here and there just a,0.1391946
little bit like some scene transitions I felt like in the first actor a little,0.165945
bit like wonky but in an even itself out and then those transitions never came,0.24217577
back again but aside from those things I loved the last Jedi for me it's,0.103913315
on the same level as the force awakens I think in some ways it does,0.07539887
things better the force awakens like for instance is its own story it's not like,0.077430665
retreading I were stepping on familiar territory no it's kind of its own story no,0.086285345
kind of does do a couple threads and nods to the original and I feel,0.06276287
like the characters grew a little better than this one but in terms of like,0.03154497
a wholesome feeling I felt like the force awakens beats it out I'm gonna give,0.1413997
Star Wars Episode 8 the last Jedi a 9.2 on it's in definitely check it,0.061057825
out it's Star Wars movie of course you're gonna go see it just turn off,0.11382034
