they wanted to do everything perfectly right because they wanted to get into the good schools last day of school,0.13191654

now the story and this is really cool,0.025936984
it's got kind of a John Hughes 1980s kind of feel but the difference is it's not like this jocks,0.2575392
versus nerds thing you always see in every freakin movie no there's everything in between in this and the characters feel a lot more real except for the two gay guys that do theater they're a little bit over the top,0.80489635
but everybody else here is very grounded which means anyone who watches this really can find one character they can kind of relate to when they were in high school and the students here they're just really trying to figure themselves out,0.042479288
I think everybody is in in some way the two main girls Billy and Molly are great together in this the big girl I'm not saying that in a bad way I like big girls even though I wouldn't like a 20 year old big girl Tanika P beanie Feldstein my friend I'm missin Natasha told me she's in what we do in the shadows the TV show I love the movie they said the show's good too,0.25215754
so I want to see that and I gotta tell you she's got a bright future ahead of her because she's freaking awesome in this,0.4111435
I did a little research on her and it turns out she's Jonah Hill's little sister I had no freaking idea also Billie lourd Princess Leia's daughter Carrie Fisher's daughter she's in this too she has like this running gag frickin great man it doesn't get old she's fun,0.48920247
and by the way Olivia Wilde she's who directed this this is her directorial debut,0.21678415

there's a scene I won't get into where two characters start to argue,0.08954944
and there's something in the background that happened and it just the whole scene is just kind of like a picture of society today and I don't know it was just a really beautifully shot scene that what I was just like wow dude,0.14645526
and this movie is a coming-of-age story that really is more relatable than most of these type two movies man,0.18910511
there's just something about it,0.050439563
the humor is great,0.05764239
in this,0.051490646
and there's definitely some laugh-out-loud moments this frickin Panda I love a pant you'll see the panda bear it's a stuffed animals freaking awesome,0.554174
but I think what makes this movie a little bit different is that where other movies that are coming of age that can be a real raunchy and everything and then it'll stop and remind you,0.17828414
