time this is a beautifully shot film from a 24 and it's their first movie,0.10276525
that received a PG rating it's great to see the film rely so heavily on,0.029640432
the story especially when it's very simple and pretty straightforward as an audience were exposed,0.04867127
to this Chinese culture and that was new to me but it was still really,0.1500449
accessible because down deep we all have family and we all have people that we,0.0805593
care about and so we were able to connect in ways regardless if we understand,0.07387663
the culture are familiar with it now it was awesome to watch and I got,0.058697548
to tell you that a lot of the food that they showed really made me,0.07963688
hungry so when you watch us make sure you've already eaten otherwise you're gonna be,0.26330397
upset for about 90 minutes until you can go chow down on something aquafina is,0.15418194
billy the granddaughter and she is the lead of this film and she absolutely crushes,0.10075886
it and then she is just surrounded by a supporting cast who is spectacular I,0.09157199
mean they are all just genuine and human and so believable and that makes it,0.10971006
really easy to relate and sympathize with them now while there is a fair amount,0.039095648
of heavy drama to this I mean because you it's surrounding the idea of death,0.3835769
the filmmakers really sprinkle in just the right amount of humor at the right times,0.09250112
to keep us from going into the bell jar but it's not like overly funny,0.10099277
where you where you lose sight of the drama I mean it's just that perfect,0.19520961
balance it's really easy to fall in love with a family because the interactions are,0.09314291
genuine and heartfelt and they just feel so real and we get to know them,0.055140056
quirks and all as they just navigate this grief that they're going with and dealing,0.09222712
with the the imminent death of their grandmother but also trying to keep that smile,0.26732275
on their face so that she doesn't find out what's actually going on now I,0.2738453
know that seems a little bit weird and they expected to keep that secret from,0.16562666
somebody that you are dying the movie does a really good job of explaining it,0.24211693
and putting us into that culture so that we do get a good understanding of,0.13132338
why they would do that even though they may be struggling through it filmmakers also,0.08356209
employ some really great imagery I mean it's subtle but still really powerful I think,0.102843456
the simplicity of the story mixed with the complexity of the emotions and the beliefs,0.054172944
is really what makes this film stand out to me there were a few scenes,0.12295822
that were funny but also touching as well I mean there's one that involves the,0.119633
family going to visit the grave of their grandfather and just that whole interaction and,0.18013352
even leading up to them getting to the grave just everything that encompasses that and,0.19456424
the dialogue that they're using is very powerful but also has some great humorous moments,0.05828495
to it there's also a drinking game that goes on at a wedding and it,0.090393096
is just like some jacked-up version of the funky chicken I have no idea what's,0.26944017
going on but it's really funny and then leads to a very emotional scene one,0.09468494
other one is part that we see in a trailer and it's Aquafina learning some,0.051451005
exercise moves from her grandmother and just the interactions that they have how touching it,0.14803877
is and still being able to be funny all the while and of course all,0.056735188
of those add humor but they also do such a good job to draw us,0.031087222
into the characters and into the story now if I were gonna nitpick there were,0.037608527
two shots that just kind of seemed to go on a little too long one's,0.19269833
an exterior of a building and the other is the cast walking and it looks,0.08686572
like they're in a music video it's just a slow-mo walk and both of those,0.24056031
just seem to sit on them a little too long even though they're great shots,0.24028051
but even if you were to trim them down you're only gonna save about 10,0.15068556
12 seconds at most so it's just it's negligent and it doesn't really matter and,0.16491374
again like I said that's only if I'm nitpicking and really trying to find something,0.053517483
that I felt was even remotely wrong with the movie the relationships also are so,0.082871765
well executed I mean they're grounded in reality and just so believable and you can,0.24191287
see yourself in them I mean I can see myself having one of these interactions,0.33957633
or being part of this family just being sucked in to the drama that I'm,0.5154597
seeing and then therefore the ride I don't know what kind of distribution the film,0.08588428
itself is gonna get but you should take every opportunity you can to see the,0.10266673
farewell it is that good it's a perfect mix of drama and humor with a,0.091894664
wonderful story in a spectacular cast there's no sex nudity or violence but there is,0.47690737
a little profanity I give the farewell five out of five couches are you planning,0.09657751
