hey everybody Christina here for Cinna fix I went and saw Pixar's new movie inside out a little early and I'm gonna tell you how it was first off,0.124144904
I'm guessing if you're thinking about seeing inside out,0.17814866
there's really two things,0.03734731
you want to know how it ranks and the greater Pixar hierarchy and how many times its gonna make you cry to answer,0.14045842
the first question it's at least a solid ratatouille maybe better pretty pretty darn good to even really great as for the crying question I missed it up twice,0.31089434
and got a little lump in my throat once but no actual tears there were tons of things,0.22199583
I loved about this movie the voice acting was really great,0.15893252
especially Phyllis Smith as sadness and Lewis Black his anger was just like the most perfectly cast actor in the history of cinema the animation to go with them was great it was spot-on and it was constantly clever and surprising the world was really rich and well imagined the the representation of the workings of a person's mind,0.112644315
were we're really cool and surprising and there was always something kind of new that you were like oh that's right that makes sense overall,0.09148281
I'm gonna try to keep this review pretty vague cuz,0.31089434
I went into it knowing almost nothing more than what you see in the trailers,0.093635954
and I think a lot of other people want to do that too,0.05383001
so I'm gonna try to talk around any actual plot points,0.09188295
but I am gonna talk about a few of the things that were in the trailers,0.06471873
and if you somehow deliberately avoided the trailers then why are you watching this review hit watch later come back go on go,0.1354322
the movie centers around the emotions of Riley who's an 11 year old girl and well she's dealing with some things and so are her emotions as Riley deals with those things two of her emotions joy and sadness get lost in the long-term memory section of her Riley's mind and they have to deal with each other,0.13542935
so the folks at Pixar this is this is the sort of thing they do they communicate abstract mechanics of a person's psyche in a really fun clever visual way so that that's a delight and you know the more you like that the more you'll like the movie as a whole that said I would personally probably trade a few of those really clever moments for a little bit more character development about the relationship between joy and sadness,0.08259477
it's clear that these two characters have a have a conflict with each other,0.10366709
but it's it's all a little bit surface which kind of makes sense because they're one emotion characters but you know it would have been nice to explore that a little bit deeper overall the landscape of Riley's mind reminds me a lot of the spaceship scenes and wall-e and the scenes at Paradise Falls and up Pixar creates these like really amazing well imagined worlds but I found in talking to a lot of friends that they're very divisive like wall-e and up sort of lost,0.14476845
a lot of people when the dogs started talking and flying airplanes or when it's all fat humans,0.5671202
in wheelchairs under their robot overlords,0.07129181
and I think that the setting of inside out might have had a slightly similar effect on me like I didn't entirely emotionally connect with this world because while I was delighted to discover it it didn't necessarily feel real the way Carl and Ellie not being able to have a kid and up did inside out also didn't benefit from the amazing like first 10 to 20 minutes that wall-e and up both had so your mileage on connecting to this world may vary I ended up seeing inside out alone just due to hazards of scheduling,0.07509323
so I missed out on the chance to see if somebody else had connected with the world in a different way than I had,0.083861396
I think that there's a really good chance that people will like this movie more than I did,0.09502391
but I don't think there are that many people who are going to like it less than I did unless,0.09304284
they you know hate cartoons in which case,0.35131866
I don't think you were planning to see this anyway so all in all if you're interested in seeing inside out,0.18910782
you should definitely see it,0.07616824
I think that it's a really solid effort by Pixar not it's best not its worst,0.11049095
but you might have a little bit of you might have a similar experience,0.12624234
as I did which is I don't quite feel as connected to these characters as I have with other characters in me and Pixar universe one small caveat if you happen to be going with a kid between the ages of like I don't know four and six there are some representations in Riley's mind of things that that scared her as a little kid that are brought back,0.08189611
and like cartoonishly over-the-top funny hilarious ways but so anyone over the age of eight will be able to laugh at those moments,0.096158095
but if you're dealing with like a much more literal minded small small child you might be dealing with a little bit of Nightmare fuel,0.4237734
so just keep that in mind overall,0.13119832
I think this is Pixar's best movie since Toy Story 3 in that like it definitely is better than brave and monsters University but it's not in my personal,0.1875457
top five Pixar movies although like I said it might be in yours,0.19230576
so you should definitely check it out and find out where it stands up for you,0.08247622
so that's what I thought of inside out,0.13479057
but I want to hear what you think are you gonna go see it have you seen it already,0.0832659
what did you think,0.0773198
