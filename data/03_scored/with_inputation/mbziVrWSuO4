that in the trailer all of his progeny are defective or at least less than,0.4031958
desirable in one way or another Rian Johnson wrote and directed this whodunit that combines,0.082429826
comedy with intrigue in a way that feels both familiar and new the ensemble cast,0.075054444
that they have assembled is awesome but they don't all share the same screen time,0.098272495
we have Jamie Lee Curtis who's playing the daughter of Christopher Plummer Don Johnson is,0.11472265
her husband and then their son Chris Evans who is doing his best to break,0.105038285
away from his Captain America role there's Michael Shannon playing a son and Toni Collette,0.19920087
who is the wife of a deceased son so she's a sister-in-law to Jamie Lee,0.52267367
Curtis and Michael Shannon but she really she has no blood ties to the family,0.3011275
anymore although Christopher Plummer has been taken care of her Kathryn Langford and Jaden Martell,0.087960064

family doing the questioning there is a straight trooper Noah Siegen and then there is,0.113854095
Daniel Craig who is the private investigator who is hired he has a wonderfully forced,0.08111537
and awkward southern accent that adds to the charm and I'm not saying it as,0.10015187
a bad thing because it really does just round out his character at one point,0.11492568
it's in one of the trail Chris Evans is like CSI KFC and that's kind,0.07794278
of what it is he's got this just this Southern drawl to him that is,0.1298756
just exaggerated but it really works it's like molasses rolling off your tongue the chemistry,0.29567024
of the cast is wonderful especially in their dysfunction as a family and I love,0.12975511
how the story unfolds at the beginning all of their stories their accounts are cut,0.055003397
together in a very entertaining way there are a lot of twists and turns of,0.09279381
this and despite finding out a lot that happens about halfway through the film they,0.05092231
still hold back enough to keep it very entertaining and to just keep giving you,0.1548031
misdirection so that you have to keep guessing the movie does have comedy and it,0.14304689
is funny but it's not overly so which allows it to stay away from the,0.07885932
goofiness I mean there are goofy moments in there but they're very small and and,0.49144506
far between so that's why I said like at the very beginning of this in,0.071511015
my intro that it's a little like clue but more along the lines towards Agatha,0.089006
Christie I mean there's a lot more mystery to it with just a tiny bit,0.31089434
of you know goofiness thrown in the comedy though is still there especially from La,0.36758453
Keith Stanfield he does some amazing looks and emotions with his eyes and he doesn't,0.123014286
talk but he conveys so much in these moments and it was just awesome to,0.10774557
watch because you know exactly what he's thinking because we were thinking it also and,0.06617173
he is just confirming it for us Daniel Craig and honored Armas end up being,0.104266524
the leads in this which was surprising to me I didn't realize they would have,0.0604448
as much screen time as they did they work really great together especially when you,0.07627964
factor into our mice's character oddity it's brilliant and awesome and a great addition to,0.08517615
her character and something that I don't think I've ever seen before and so it,0.13222906
was really it was funny but it added a whole new level to her character,0.07349595
and what she could or couldn't do as great that they work well together because,0.09692915
they are both in the 25th James Bond film no time to die that's coming,0.21683182
out in 2020 surprisingly Jayden Martell is barely in this I mean he's more seen,0.14565518
than heard even though he is the punchline to some really funny quips the story,0.058650013
balance the characters very well but like I said they don't all have equal screen,0.06509547
time which I guess is kind of a problem just when you have such a,0.13708988
large ensemble cast that some are gonna take the forefront some are gonna have to,0.055400383
fall back and you just you trust the story and if it works then it,0.081168085
works and in this it works because it doesn't feel like it's missing anything and,0.07028218
then one thing that I really loved is that I didn't guess the outcome that's,0.050263528
a huge thing for me especially in a mystery because if I can guess it,0.103015214
right off the bat or even partway through and then that's what it ends up,0.102628924
being I just kind of been bored and a little disappointed I mean yay me,0.11805408
but come on I just sat through a long movie and if I guessed it,0.1056365
then you need to write a better mystery I mean take some cues from Agatha,0.12381485
Christie she was really good and very innovative in the way that she would tell,0.08370334
a mystery there are a few moments that dragged a little bit I mean the,0.09695475
movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes long but for the most part it seemed,0.061345283
to move at an efficient pace now one thing that has me curious like any,0.06635723
good mystery is will it hold up to multiple viewings I mean once you know,0.056993973
who did it can you watch it again and can you still be entertained I,0.08341962
mean I think back to some of the movies where there's a big twist or,0.07308752
a big reveal and maybe it is watchable again you know i well usual suspects,0.08798012
I love that one I love the twist at the end and I do watch,0.068305604
that one over and over again even though I know what the twist is I,0.05618624
guess I'll find out with knives out because I'm seeing it in two days from,0.18596637
this date of this recording even though I had high hopes for this film it,0.07901282
ended up surpassing what I thought and was a ton of fun if you enjoy,0.12355245
mysteries with comedy and a great ensemble cast and I don't think you're gonna go,0.14886676
