hey what's going on out there YouTube this is SEL zero three two zero representing,0.053831317
JVs unfortunately I will not be watching any of you guys as livestream comments I'm,0.080724694
just going to be getting straight to the point because I want to be able,0.09850039
to articulate what I really feel about Wonder Woman after reflecting on everything I saw,0.060103334
last night after the review after the discussions after it was all said and done,0.017412512
you know from my critical side from my critic side what did I truly think,0.04034206
about you know one woman because I think that it's so easy to get lost,0.15329489
in the sauce with you know being excited having a decent movie to having something,0.041264668
that actually works and then having your friends be there to really enjoy it with,0.04315778
you it's hard to sit there and critique something in that nature so this will,0.053953044
be my finite number review as well as my ultimate perspective on Wonder Woman that,0.051106725
I saw last night alright so here we go um looking at Wonder Woman in,0.06475496
the way that I would dissect it I think that it's a very well-done origin,0.09591948
story for one woman based on her mythos based on her character development and I,0.045626275
think that even from a written standpoint I think it was written very well I,0.056034405
think they took a lot of time engaging where they wanted to go with the,0.013545135
character and it wasn't like necessarily tied down to anything with the DCU in any,0.039393507
regard of what they were able to do before it I think that the other,0.03283812
thing about this that I actually really appreciate it is how the fact that when,0.023737079
they actually did commit to the somber moments or the sad moments that they were,0.03316739
able to push through them they not that they lingered on like you know this,0.11768296
doom and gloom kind of situation but when there was something serious that was actually,0.06412171
happening they stuck to their guns and actually did it very well I think the,0.07135758
other part of this is that um when I was looking at the film I,0.017425152
think that man-ho you guys you sorry I'm on my breakfast right now so for,0.06571748
me I think they were able to commit to those somber moments very well like,0.087021984
when there was moments of you know like man that was a weighty scene they,0.05016283
committed to it and I think that the credit goes to for me is definitely,0.021053728
in street Trevor character it was played by Chris Pine he committed to every single,0.012323857
every single line every single moment like he was the character actually rally behind even,0.033488672
just as much as I did for Diana Prince played by God to died but,0.11013047
when he had these moments of like this charismatic character this brave character he acted,0.040322103
them very well towards the third eye I think that he had one of the,0.041013893
strongest pushes to push her into who she need to be as Diana Prince as,0.12045079
Wonder Woman and moving forward and again this is going to be a non-spoiler review,0.026776303
um I now going through a lot of the positives I think that the score,0.06572547
was very well done they they did such a great job with the score that,0.022120018
I was really surprised that I was like I really want to buy the score,0.016016956
um I think that the set pieces where they went from London to the muscaria,0.15620974
that was I mean even if I compare it to you know Thor Thor the,0.018222706
dark world like this this rivaled that in so many different ways I think that,0.1505896
they did a really great job committing to how they wanted to showcase you know,0.03269178
the Amazonians and the scare I think that there there was some negative stand points,0.08737387
I think there were some moments where I wanted to go more in depth with,0.026524197
the lore of the Amazonians I think they could have went more in depth with,0.024684966
it but I think what they gave us was enough for be like alright I'm,0.03804651
hooked in when you make another Wonder Woman - which I'm guarantee at this point,0.02790778
they're going to I know that I'm gonna see more I know I'm gonna see,0.031179817
more history more richness of where things are going to go and at the same,0.018967047
time there's so much intriguing mystery that you don't know everything you know moving forward,0.025370104
and I think that that makes for a really good origin story as well but,0.02593418
at the same time I think that critically you know I could have been given,0.023324
a little bit more I could have been like okay was this character pivotal so,0.032007307
I think even like you know Robin Wright's character is amazed easing as her character,0.009482858
actually wasn't this I didn't know much about her you know but from from a,0.025883626
compass and I know you know I think that they did a really good job,0.025242388
with her and with the mother but I think I would have benefited from seeing,0.037378665
so maybe some flashbacks I think that definitely would have worked a lot better in,0.022507818
terms of the film um the third act okay so for me I didn't have,0.025842385
a real problem third that I actually appreciated the fights you know the weight of,0.04823912
it in the way they ended I think it ended perfectly in a lot of,0.055787623
different ways from a superhero standpoint but I think that there were some moments where,0.012274634
I was like okay Wonder Woman you know what are you doing like you know,0.08218277
like okay this is I understand your perspective on it but I don't know and,0.05443863
I think that that could be kind of a negative critique but at the same,0.029494243
time the way the gal gadot character portrayed one woman her you know her vigour,0.09980548
her light everything about her represented this person that was new to the world that,0.056078307
understood right from wrong they had a lot of book knowledge but didn't have any,0.025515115
life experience as much as you know she's been around or Amazonians she has not,0.06300221
known what it means to see somebody suffer she's not known what it means to,0.19704668
see you know somebody weaker than her but at the same as that time have,0.058530174
as much life as her and I think that when you think of somebody has,0.026276749
a lesser being and not necessarily I'm not saying she did but just when she,0.0634838
was raised versus what she sees she used she was a lot of growth there's,0.02554904
a lot of character growth in this film for her that gal gadot displayed very,0.027849909
well like when she starts actually utilizing her powers I was like this is better,0.0343727
than you know when Henry Cavill was portraying you know in men still like the,0.024089625
evolution of his powers and he got it so quickly but this one was way,0.03698155
more believable in terms of her as an amazonian at the same time even more,0.024309801
so when she starts stepping into the fold as Wonder Woman I think that they,0.04147021
did a really good job taking the time with that and I think it's going,0.03662102
to pay off in the long term because a lot of people their critiques what,0.083481215
man still was that this happens here this happens here this doesn't make no sense,0.053333092
while he do this I mean this is a person that you know within a,0.033786006
day it became ed and super me and he had no experience like you know,0.101379976
they hadn't had experience she had fighting experience she has wisdom taught to her in,0.05337101
a different way strategically you know but at the same is that time she's never,0.034431234
gone through anything and I think that they were able to unfold that in this,0.050596528
film so eloquently well um but what else can i really say without spoiling anything,0.08112247
and I don't want to ask any questions I really want to just articulate my,0.035688434
thoughts in a conducive way as to not fanboy out because the geek in me,0.10621919
I love the film I really enjoyed the film I gave the film initially a,0.0051232446
9.5 rating I must say this okay and I can't give this film anything less,0.06967666
than a 9 out of 10 I'll say that from a record like this is,0.025547707
uh this is all my my critical side this is on me as a critic,0.06510751
I can only drop one point off of a ten only because I don't know,0.09477802
any more negatives to actually go off on this I really legit don't um I,0.052337315
did not watch it in IMAX 3d I did not watch it in 3d at,0.04728591
all I just watched it as the film as is and it was a really,0.013032278
done well film I think that from the way that they paced it from the,0.034604847
way that they processed it the progression of it I think some people are gonna,0.042050913
be like this drives on a little too long but there was never a moment,0.02464439
that I didn't enjoy it what I mean by that is there's committed comedic relief,0.034670703
there is actual leaf there somber relief there's moments of just the quiet moments there's,0.017742444
moment where you literally see her in the mascara just looking out into the distance,0.07416997
and you're picturing your head like what's going on through your head but it's way,0.25113145
done so much better than you know some of the other superior feels like not,0.03868974
even DC Universe like some other superior friends that I was kind of like go,0.06027362
there for you know like they went there with it with her and I think,0.039378207
that they paid so much on watch not just to a superhero character but from,0.014091915
the first in my opinion best female superhero movie they've ever done I mean when,0.11043179
we gun compared to we got a super girl we got Catwoman and got electric,0.3220995
all of them technically we had two heroes versus Supergirl but this was one of,0.06644653
the best superhero films that I had seen I think I'd actually make comparison to,0.02064597
this one to spider-man 1 and Batman Begins in terms of superhero origin lore but,0.028254341
as far as it being a film critically actually assessed this was a well-done film,0.03648865
this distance period it is is a really good job with it was fun it,0.036362927
was entertaining I can take my mom to see it I could take my you,0.09751991
know my wife to see it I could go take a little kid to go,0.12791082
see it and specifically you know females like this caters to the female demographic not,0.23400228
just female empowerment but at the same time the preservation of life in and of,0.24312857
itself that was you know brought forth from women like they even addressed that in,0.202432
the very early parts of some flashbacks of what you know the Amazonians and women,0.06206363
in general did for mankind and I think that the way that they portrayed Steve,0.030837249
Trevor in the way that he you know respects Diana as much as follows and,0.0069564907
rallies behind her and when it's time for him to move he moves no matter,0.19583938
what he's brave he's endearing and he's respectful of her which I've not seen that,0.047883246
honestly and certain characters um and as I said like I don't have any real,0.04862426
big negatives I think that um the villains I don't think I didn't talk about,0.033752747
I'm not gonna not gonna go in there I think that there were some weak,0.075165085
moments towards the middle um but they were self-sufficient I don't think that they came,0.039321
off kind of not cartoonish in the very beginning stages when I was kinda like,0.042670865
huh you know and that falls into that - one that I would say but,0.030662306
towards the end it all it all ultimately paid off and I actually really enjoyed,0.08944924
what they did for Wonder Woman I recommend you definitely go and check it out,0.06898819
for yourself don't go into this with a lot of high expectations like as much,0.05162158
as I you know nerd it out yesterday and enjoyed the film and I keep,0.12475386
doubt I legitimately did geek out um I would say go into it with low,0.08556523
expectations go into it trying to have a fun time take your daughter take your,0.16584957
mom go into it with somebody that's a fan of the superhero Laura are not,0.031121947
even just DC Lord just going there to see a good action pad fun superhero,0.026633954
film and I promise you you're gonna enjoy yourself you might rate it you know,0.10094827
a seven out of 10 you might ready to eight out of ten my rating,0.11387611
a ten out of ten but I promise you one thing that you're going to,0.049089223
actually appreciate and enjoy the way that they crafted this super your film and yes,0.032917943
this was written and helped by Zack Snyder and Geoff Johns and patty Jenkins did,0.048495878
direct the mess out of this film but as much as that they did a,0.048653528
great job um Chris Pine gal gadot stole the show for me personally and then,0.12541306
there were some other notable people as far as even their team their team was,0.022195848
really dope I just really personally thought that they did a really good job as,0.04247796
a film critic with this film and I give it a 9 out of 10,0.03287005
again if you didn't hear me before I can't get anything less than that I,0.029061874
was thinking about maybe as much as I could bash it or you know go,0.21263261
back and forth but even when I was comparing it to like man still man,0.073583946
still still is one of my favorite you know DCU films period you know um,0.039927647
but this either one equals and rivals it or is better let's just just flat,0.051005617
out but anyway my breakfast time is over I sacrifice my breakfast time to be,0.20954947
able to give you guys a critical retrospective on Wonder Woman and that's what I,0.03597579
have to say about it if you have anything more definitely go and see me,0.054771885
ran and kick out about one a woman again the soundtrack was amazing the score,0.30749056
was amazing the acting was done well was it perfect there are most definitely some,0.015494123
cheesy moments there were some moments towards the third act I was kind of like,0.033520598
this is unnecessary this doesn't make sense but at the same time sincerity of the,0.017427811
character one woman and what they were to bring to light for the character it,0.03517358
was represented very well and me basically knowing the Lord and being movie critic I,0.025340836
really could appreciate and rally behind Wonder Woman and I definitely will be seeing it,0.05574771
again if possible I'll try to see it on the 30th with that press screening,0.025418663
if not either way I'm going to be I already have my tickets bought arm,0.05410338
for June the 1st anyway keep it locked JVs we can stop and I saw,0.11926277
what you says I mean man still has some epic best action this one definitely,0.04614113
rivals that if not it's better as far as action I'll say that off the,0.03686049
off the gate if not the action this maybe pacifically better all right you guys,0.040971987
hopefully y'all enjoy my retrospective review keep a lot JVs when you'll stop leave your,0.077746
