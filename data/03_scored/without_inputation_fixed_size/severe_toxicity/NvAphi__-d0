city lights was released in 1931 and was written and directed by Charlie Chaplin it,0.011652022
also stars him this was a major passion project for him and something that he,0.023439076
worked on for many years if you guys aren't familiar with Charlie Chaplin he was,0.025144607
one of the biggest stars of the silent film era his character the sometimes known,0.004905064
as The Little or he would sometimes refer to him as little man this is,0.025982738
a character that's synonymous with the silent era was one of the most famous at,0.016125383
the time and one that Chaplin had portrayed in various films and short films and,0.029431716
Chaplin's choice to make city lights as a silent film despite the fact that Hollywood,0.014878828
had begun to move towards the talkies was a divisive one because people felt at,0.067344524
the time that talkies were going to take over and of course they did but,0.04035004
Chaplin was of the belief that silent films were really what filmmaking was all about,0.05249563
in the talkies they would die out in a few years but I think his,0.23052765
real motivation for making this a silent film was that he wasn't very comfortable with,0.034340106
the idea of this character that he created existing in a talkie he didn't think,0.06613921
that the character would be as funny because it's a character that relies a lot,0.028829724
on pantomime and expressions it's very physical lots of sight gags a lot of things,0.059996903
that he does in this film are a bit like a dance so he was,0.1347835
afraid that this character would not work in a talkie and he may have been,0.043626733
right and nevertheless we have city lights as a silent film and I would say,0.029751005
it's probably my favorite silent film this is a movie about Chaplin's famed character the,0.017688563
who meets a blind woman who's selling flowers he quickly becomes infatuated with her and,0.12715717
has to try to court her without her finding out that he isn't rich and,0.049755737
when the befriends someone who actually is rich a drunk man who's trying to commit,0.1673582
suicide and he keeps him from doing that their roles switch quite often and he,0.4112341
gets the opportunity to have access to things that only a wealthy man at the,0.035724353
time would have like a car or money to buy flowers from her and so,0.03408135
now we have a moral dilemma he loves this girl she likes him back but,0.15249668
she thinks that he's rich and he's really not city lights is one of my,0.07610965
favorite romantic comedies if you were to call it that in many ways it has,0.04410367
influenced all romantic comedies that have come since then especially in its final scene I,0.08133932
have seen countless films with a moment so similar to the way this film ends,0.034523696
that you can understand why so many people credit Chaplin for showing Hollywood how to,0.015328492
make films or how they can make films that are financially successful while also being,0.024262574
critically successful because this film was both of those things Albert Einstein came to the,0.028145915
premiere and we still have a photo of that today and so you can tell,0.026591381
that Chaplin was definitely someone that people were paying attention to at the time he,0.019472586
was already famous by the time this movie came out but the idea of making,0.042266432
a silent film once talkies had been introduced reminds me of how Alfred Hitchcock decided,0.03975736
to make psycho black and white in 1960 even though colorized films were popular at,0.022318907
the time he wanted to make a film that was black and white because he,0.009730306
felt that that approach to filmmaking had more merit behind it had more suspense to,0.037281547
it he could get more things out of it than he could from a film,0.07089594
that was shot in color but what's inescapable about this film when you watch it,0.10563848
today is just how damn funny it is from scene 1 I'm laughing my ass,0.65690726
off there are so many sequences that are so simple the things that he's able,0.027753457
to do with this character a boxing match in particular this dance that everyone's doing,0.057133954
highly choreographed and very well rehearsed it's just so goddamn hilarious and that's Chaplin he,0.35733727
was such a perfectionist a lot of people when you think of a perfectionist filmmaker,0.05162091
you instantly think of someone like Stanley Kubrick who was definitely a perfectionist Chaplin may,0.12906425
have been even more so history has shown us through various interviews with cast members,0.031270947
of this film people involved in the production and documentaries about it that he would,0.070577316
shoot sequences far more than other people would he would do shot after shot take,0.516847
after take to try to achieve something that was in his head he would sometimes,0.14251825
jump into other actors roles and perform the sequence exactly how he wanted them to,0.07567861
do it there was quite a bit of on set tension between him and star,0.10031768
Virginia charile because the way Chaplin worked he shot this film over the course of,0.23163325
a couple years and he was such a perfectionist about making everything as good as,0.044831384
it could be that some of his actors including Jarrell were getting antsy and he,0.060904216
actually fired her at one point reshot parts of the film with someone else before,0.14241382
eventually rehiring her again this is not the type of filmmaking that could be done,0.028752564
today Virginia charile today in 2018 would go on her Twitter and say Charlie Chaplin,0.06120887
just fired me and it's horrible and you know Charlie Chaplin would be faceless with,0.0794655
so much pressure from social media and the news world to be a better person,0.02421202
perhaps that's a good thing but in the long run his incredible OCD perfectionist brain,0.1716533
made one of the best films of all time and so you have to wonder,0.033531908
just at what point did Charlie Chaplin go overboard or did he go overboard by,0.024085635
firing people and rehiring people and then firing them and rehiring someone else did he,0.43987387
go overboard or was he just trying to make a perfect movie in the way,0.06653034
that he felt he could it's interesting to view old Hollywood versus new Hollywood and,0.03155964
I read about the production i watch interviews i watch documentaries and I realized that,0.038100388
if this exact film was being made today it would be very controversial in the,0.028528396
way he handled himself on the set but it resulted in a great film and,0.021632437
one that is timeless because nowadays there's a bit of apprehension when you sit down,0.03338091
and watch even a black and white film kids today they don't want to watch,0.119489595
movies that are old like that even some adults don't want to watch older films,0.07834267
let alone a silent film one that is told entirely through pantomime music and some,0.035375796
sound effects this actually does have some sound effects there's a hiccuping whistle scene there's,0.040843606
some sort of like almost like Charlie Brown talking in the background where some people,0.08990356
are like a crowd in the beginning are chanting and it's like it sounds like,0.052877445
almost like a kazoo that was actually Charlie Chaplin making those sounds which makes it,0.05415393
the first time Charlie Chaplin's actual voice was ever heard in a film they're going,0.018150201
back to that apprehension that people have about watching a silent film I think it's,0.06793587
gonna be boring or that it's not going to have any action sequences or anything,0.057805125
to invest you in but from the beginning of this movie consistently I'm laughing in,0.029172959
particular the scenes with Harry Myers who plays the eccentric millionaire this guy only recognizes,0.053696286
the when he's drunk when he Sobers up in the morning he's like who are,0.060681377
you get out of my house it creates some really hilarious sequences one of the,0.083987415
best moments in the whole movie is watch how you're driving him by driving the,0.01851206
guy is literally behind the wheel Chaplin and his cast have crafted a silent film,0.12451041
that is drastically funny extremely well shot and still holds up today as a film,0.053331763
that has clearly influenced tons afterwards his sight gags the slapstick his stunt work his,0.26666328
actors are all fantastic this film is a labor of love for sure if you,0.054926876
ever read into the production and a lot of people argued and it was a,0.02971974
long time coming for Chaplin but the end result is a classic that has stood,0.017238235
the test of time and if you've never seen city lights or if you've never,0.03136208
seen a silent film before this might be a really good one to start I'm,0.017681247
gonna give city lights and a plus guys thank you so much for continuing to,0.031000884
watch my series of pre 1970s reviews I went way back with this one that,0.019281678
I wanted to talk about a silent film for sure this year you guys are,0.031778485
the best thank you so much as always for watching and look forward to more,0.0140014505
