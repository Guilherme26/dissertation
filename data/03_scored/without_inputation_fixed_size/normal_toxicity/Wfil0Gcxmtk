dark nights no question Wonder Woman hits such a glorious homerun that I almost got,0.33494735
out of my seat and started cheering and this is the darn truth how does,0.69542736
the people of my theater gave the film a standing ovation when the credits started,0.1769376
rolling but why well let me tell you when it comes to films that are,0.1121559
centered around one character and a vast multiverse it is imperative that the filmmakers get,0.07379732
that character right Wonder Woman is written by Zack Snyder Allan Heinberg and Jason rush,0.091108
and portrayed by gal gadot superbly her entire dynamic screams fish out of water and,0.2322658
those types of characters are the ones I find to be easily relatable as Diana,0.09087611

fashion supernova she is a minnow in a pond chock full of piranhas I made,0.49515292
no capable of cracking open a can of whoop-ass whenever she feels like it I,0.8606264

my opinion Chris Pine also put on a great performance as Steve Trevor and the,0.026104938
romance between Trevor and Diana was satisfying me in vest and not sappy as the,0.10154839
main romance is one of the most common areas where superhero movies fault flat but,0.060232934
not when it comes to this film everyone else put on really good or great,0.1646955
performances with Lucy Davis particularly shining on the flipside of substance the visual / CGI,0.059961937
effects were top-notch although there were some parts that boasted uneven CGI specifically the fire,0.08098625
effects however one particular department I'm not single out is the stunt work the stunts,0.09088775
are amazing and something I can appreciate that patty Jenkins does not use varying camera,0.10773922
angles to mask the not so spectacular stunt not that that's a bad thing because,0.107814424
even the worst stunts were still good that tells you how dedicated Jenkins was to,0.36265284
this project and I dearly hope that she holds more films in the DCE you,0.22026671
now back to what I was previously discussing the fighting sequences themselves are something to,0.08495364
behold unlike Captain America Civil War where there were some fighting scenes worth complaining about,0.13808459
I can't recall one dole moment of action throughout this entire film the action and,0.047432225
fighting sequences kept me on the edge of my seat throughout this movie's runtime while,0.10662475
the drama rarely ever lets up deign what agendas is its Wonder Woman just as,0.1553521
great as the Dark Knight no but it does come close so overall Wonder Woman,0.20524108
is a standout among the DC EU not just because it's colorful they're not a,0.09587315
depression inducing shade of gray but the film's handling and representation of the iconic titular,0.028544478
character is unparalleled one room / Diana Prince is both a fierce warrior and a,0.0878052
curious individual determined to restore peace to mankind and learn all about the Rays of,0.08506079
life as well intensely terrific action a conclusive plot a satisfying main romance and a,0.1529066
colorful tone with serious elements all gelled together to form my favorite film of 2017,0.18060502
