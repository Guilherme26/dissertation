what is going on guys welcome back to my channel and this is my review,0.10124741
for the 2019 French film portrait of a lady on fire this movie was directed,0.10161794
by Celine ski Amma and this is about a young painter who is commissioned to,0.061743658
paint a portrait of a bride-to-be but the bride is reluctant she does not want,0.11860626
to get married and so this painter must paint her in secret as she spends,0.093977354
every single day with her walking on the beach and just being a friend and,0.15437576
little does the bride-to-be know that she is being painted by someone she admires and,0.079100385
respects this is a film that I've wanted to see for a while it's a,0.056654647
movie that you know kind of was unjustly not nominated for the Academy Awards and,0.05607455
I thought that was a little interesting so I wanted to see really what this,0.059512235
movie was truly about and if this movie did deserve an Oscar nomination for Best,0.079714306
International Feature and I gotta say that it deserved a Best International Feature nomination this,0.044474736
is a movie that is beautiful number one the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking it is,0.08601354
the first film to be conceived that I have seen in 8k all of the,0.067521445
colors are so rich they're so clear I mean it looks unrealistic because it's so,0.16510597
realistic and that's the thing that this movie truly has going for it is it,0.07969904
has this beautiful way of almost painting every single scene knowing that this is a,0.09009431
movie about a painter who has to paint this bride-to-be and this is a film,0.106413685
that has a beautiful love story that is almost hopeful but yet hopeless and that's,0.06785861
the thing that I think I I loved the most about this film is it,0.09187084
tells it from a very real perspective these two women they fall in love but,0.33431992
the problem is is that there's no way that this romance is ever going to,0.062304202
last and because of certain obligations that one of them has to having to be,0.06533145
married to a man that she doesn't even know or she hasn't even met and,0.2550629
this this painter who kind of lives by herself and has to be almost independent,0.23565754
and so it's a very secretive affair or relationship that these two women have and,0.31089434
it's told from a very realistic perspective of how this actually would never happen in,0.07527945
a true society back in the time period that this movie said him that's one,0.12201913
thing that this movie has going for is that it is a very beautiful love,0.0864029
story that truly shows the true strengths and the true weaknesses of a true romantic,0.067522995
encounter in true romantic relationship and these women it's almost like they have to rush,0.37370178
everything all at once because they only have so much time to spend with one,0.07616578
another before they both have to part and go their separate ways and it's it's,0.07357765
heartbreaking it's very heart wrenching and you feel for these two characters as they finally,0.058342997
have that happiness that they've been longing for throughout the entirety of their lives now,0.15188554
the thing about this movie to me also that I thought was very well done,0.08658372
is the way that this movie paints the scene of the setting around these characters,0.06387839
again the cinematography is almost painted on it's so gorgeous but to setting them itself,0.13439386
on this island it just almost has an eeriness to it it's it's almost a,0.09132243
little creepy but they never try to go for a hauntings and that's the thing,0.22994277
that I really respect it for because this is a movie you could look at,0.10263903
in certain scenes where you think oh are they gonna go like a little bit,0.12229335
more of a paranormal route are they gonna go like a little bit more of,0.13730058
this like creepy contingent route but they never do that they keep it very contained,0.14911819
they know exactly what they're doing and it's a very different romantic film because it's,0.06822892
it's a movie that almost essentially is it romantic and the fact that it is,0.05010577
so romantic and I don't know if that makes a lot of sense but they,0.07316714
don't ever truly romanticize these characters or make them out as their objects and that,0.115300655
it's a very lustful relationship it's very much a loving relationship between these two characters,0.09696632
the one thing that I will say is is not a negative but it's something,0.0713681
that I was a little bit maybe dissatisfied with is the way that the movie,0.08760774
wraps up because I thought that to me the way that they ended it made,0.082240455
sense but to me I was a little dissatisfied in the way that this movie,0.089520715
kind of wraps itself up because essentially these two characters after they have their romantic,0.15040144
time together and they have this love for one another they go on their separate,0.07738281
ways and essentially they don't ever really meet up again only in certain sir stances,0.08342551
that I don't want to discuss because I don't want to rob you of any,0.31089434
spoilers or any potential spoilers for this film and so the way that they kind,0.110428266
of wrapped these characters up in the satisfaction of them kind of meeting again at,0.07471504
the end of the film never happens and it never comes into fruition and so,0.06886444
that is a little bit disappointing because you definitely want to see the conclusion between,0.26154613
these two characters and the restitution as well between both of them as they both,0.054963052
have this longing for one another and they do things that are beautiful that symbolize,0.1544035
that both of them still love each other but they don't do it to the,0.09886708
effect of bringing them together and that's the one thing that I think this movie,0.07009745
could have done a little bit better of a job of doing but I get,0.08943356
the fact that they want to be more realistic and they don't want it to,0.05912012
be like essentially a formulaic romantic film but anyway guys this is a great movie,0.07185498
I think that this is a fantastic international film that I think all of you,0.0976342
can enjoy and I'm really happy that I was able to watch it as part,0.06280569
