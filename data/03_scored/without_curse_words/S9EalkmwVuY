we've a wonderful evenings entertainment lined up for you hey what's up guys this is,0.1676966
Stephie AKA in my humble opinion and welcome back to another iMHO of movie review,0.14952372
so in today's video i'm going to be talking about the newly released comedy coming-of-age,0.15138693
film entitled book smart so book smarts stars beanie Feldstein caitlin denver Billie lourd Noah,0.17787892
Galvin Skyler gasps Ando Jessica Williams Jason Sudeikis Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte the movie,0.07329467
is the directorial debut of Olivia Wilde and it was written by Susannah Fogle Emily,0.08847663
Halpern Sarah Hoskins and Katie Silverman book smart is about two highschool besties named Amy,0.3162327
and Molly and they have worked their asses off to get into the Ivy League's,0.67250884
at the cost of having a social life filled with parties and fun so the,0.05265611
school that they attend has this policy of not telling anybody where you're going to,0.091461554
college after you graduate and the day before their graduation they are horrified to learn,0.08808864
that their peers who they basically looked down on for partying throughout all of high,0.11528207
school also got into Ivy League's and other equally good schools and one of them,0.055446066
even has a job offer at Google so AV and Molly taken upon themselves to,0.12410655
fit four years of high school partying into one night and of course a lot,0.11548575
of goes down and it makes for a really really entertaining movie so as all,0.10003332
my movie reviews I'm gonna be talking about the pros the cons and then I'm,0.11565843
gonna be giving my overall rating so here we go alright so Pro number one,0.13775292
for me is the casting so there's lots of young actors new faces in this,0.102491334
movie which is really really refreshing casting for the two leads was perfect spot on,0.077872746
the side characters as well we're also really really great like Billie lourd for me,0.083766736
among the side characters was a standout every time she literally pops up like quite,0.086906046
literally pops up in this movie it's it's such a joy she's so funny Skylar,0.1802283
DiSanto I've never really watched any of his pre guesswork he's really funny as well,0.12270056
I know I keep saying they're all really funny but like genuinely they're all really,0.05996441
funny the adult cast like Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte play the parents of Caitlyn,0.116935894
Denver is great to see Jessica Williams in this as like the cool teacher and,0.043417778
then Jason Sudeikis plays their principal who is like so over his job casting and,0.09517255
that level of talent for your adult cast just gives this movie the comedic credit,0.17498298
that it really does deserve all right Pro number two for me is the chemistry,0.11975468
between your two leads so again your bleeds are played by beanie Feldstein and Katelyn,0.15446053
Denver they played the two best friends Amy and Molly I believe the first seen,0.029115513
of them is Amy picking up Molly from where she lives to you know go,0.09876983
to school just in that first scene alone like just the way that they interact,0.07369606
with each other and like their little inside jokes you can just tell that there's,0.10841633
such good friends they really play off well with one another and I don't know,0.077050276
how much of what they did together was improvised but it feels like they're just,0.093771555
like making it up on the spot and aside from obviously the comedic moments the,0.06511047
the dramatic scene which is when they fight you really take that to heart and,0.13814029
that's seem really it feels very personal because throughout the movie you have seen what,0.07261394
close friends these two girls are and how far they're willing to go for one,0.24007735
another that when they do get to the point in the movie where they have,0.056328695
that big dramatic fight scene it feels it feels very heartbreaking and sad my third,0.155062
pro this movie was Olivia Wilde's direction you know what you go girl I didn't,0.1803905
know you had it in you but apparently you did she directed the out of,0.1117224
this movie this movie is so well directed and it's amazing that this is her,0.1522155
directorial debut she made so many interesting artistic choices in the way that you chose,0.07601112
to tell this story like for instance when Molly finds out that all the other,0.041886766
kids in her school got into amazing colleges when she loses it it is so,0.34028926
reminiscent to me of Tracy Flick in election and I feel like by making those,0.10600224
subtle references to those other iconic dark comedy teen centric movies you can tell that,0.120263726
Olivia Wilde studied movies took what those movies did great and made it her own,0.23763981
like she really really did her homework how's the director one of your jobs is,0.09756997
to try and get the best performance out of your actress and I feel like,0.228281
Olivia Wilde was able to get amazing performances it feels like she's definitely an actor's,0.24647175
director because she knows that world so well therefore she knows how to communicate to,0.10818299
her cast and the acting in general in this movie just came off as so,0.18530563
natural all right my fourth pro to this movie and it's a big one it,0.1228713
succeeded so well in representing its genre which to me is a coming-of-age teen comedy,0.15534936
like I said a million times throughout this entire review this movie is genuinely funny,0.08458386
I pretty much laughed throughout the entire thing and my theatre was laughing out loud,0.14309749
with me the entire movie is a journey because it's these two girls trying to,0.17540745
get to this popular guys house party so along the way they have a lot,0.08709015
of missteps to get to the party and they find themselves in the most random,0.061114557
situations but honestly while I was watching the movie I didn't even care if they,0.0704571
ended up making the party or not because the getting there was so much fun,0.11132446
and then of course as a coming-of-age movie I definitely felt like there were so,0.09437753
many moments where you saw these characters come of age first of all the ticking,0.079744846
clock here is the fact that they're graduating so that's a huge milestone in anybody's,0.06918676
life and then you see both of these girls trying to have like their first,0.20297018
sexual experiences and their friendship throughout the course of this movie is tested a teenagers,0.31089434
in this movie like they acted and sounded like teenagers and 20-19 it's been a,0.10605187
while since I've been a teenager but for me my perspective of teenagers in 2019,0.0809171
is that they're so smart and witty and fast they're very socially and culturally aware,0.06288314
of what is going on they're a bit on edge and unsure of themselves but,0.13256472
I mean who isn't as a teenager and teenagers especially in 2019 are all about,0.12515485
being their authentic self so I really feel like they nailed that persona all right,0.13705611
so now talking about the cons my first itty-bitty con it's very nitpicky is that,0.09576956
I did not understand why Amy during their fight did not how Molly what she,0.14264305
saw I just felt like for me the girl seemed smarter than that the movie,0.24014147
seems smarter than that and I get that this was sort of like the friendships,0.17854483
breaking point you know this was supposed to be a high moment of tension for,0.07475616
these characters for this story but I just felt like it was so unrealistic that,0.07254468
at no point whatsoever while they were fighting Amy would not try to tell Molly,0.076293744
what she saw my second con this is a bigger con now is I hated,0.4594021
what they did with Jessica Williams character for Jessica Williams to be this black woman,0.032949794
who is also like the cool teacher in the school was like yes amazing but,0.04379056
then they give her this like really creepy storyline in the movie where after she,0.3370789
drives the girls to the party she goes inside the house this is a high,0.22003004
school party by the way and then one of the male students who has like,0.15522364
a crush on her starts flirting with her and then she starts flirting back and,0.3559069
then later on we learned that I guess she slept with him and I'm not,0.33966565
quite sure if this high school student is a legal consenting age but still that's,0.08960712
really really creepy and I just hate that they gave the only pretty much main,0.28907043
cast person of color that's storylines that character deserved better and Jessica Williams deserved better,0.25786018
all right so my overall rating for this movie is a solid a-minus this movie,0.07775834
is very fun very entertaining the characters are genuinely funny and I felt like I,0.061204374
was on a wild adventure with them however and this is a big however and,0.14964862
honestly I was debating whether or not to include this particular portion in my cons,0.06653918
list because I don't even I don't even know if this is a fair critique,0.14608933
and I'm gonna call myself out on it maybe this isn't a fair critique maybe,0.087567076
I'm just complaining but the movie is very white then I struggle if that's a,0.26117408
valid critique when I went on like my whole Twitter rampage at 2:00 in the,0.086003274
morning questioning if something is - white is a fair critique I got a variety,0.24253242
of responses something like yeah that is a fair thing to point out but then,0.06754657
I got another interesting reply that was like maybe your critique isn't necessarily that it,0.09935396
felt white but that it lacked diverse and the thing is this movie actually technically,0.089352086
didn't lack diversity you have the cold teacher being played by a black woman Molly,0.5357931
and Amy's classmates are racially diverse Noah galvans character in this movie he's gay and,0.06186602
his friend in the movie is black and gay I mean like technically they are,0.7833675
checking off these like boxes I guess to say and I hate I hate putting,0.34061143
it in those terms but sometimes I feel like that's what these movies are doing,0.08398665
it's like we're not gonna give like people of color the main roles we're just,0.45207998
gonna give them these side roles to check off the boxes I don't believe that's,0.06868527
what they were doing with this movie but because you positioned those sorts of characters,0.11436943
as side characters it kind of feels like that's what is happening here and I,0.044631172
get why this story's about two white girls in high school this story was written,0.37805408
by four white ladies the movie is directed by a white lady and your main,0.1622988
leads are two white girls they have every right to tell that story because that's,0.37291223
their experience of living in this world and quite frankly they they execute that story,0.23112859
so well in this movie but maybe for me that critique of this movie is,0.0996561
like to quote-unquote white while that may be true to a certain extent that doesn't,0.1898748
necessarily like make it a bad thing but at the same time it just opens,0.07571809
my eyes to the fact that there is such a lack of coming-of-age movies and,0.24182627
centered on a person of colors experience and especially a young round or black girls,0.12194559
coming-of-age experience I hope by me pointing this out there it's not till start a,0.14922075
hate train on this movie I think this movie is so funny it's so great,0.4687951
I genuinely feel like this movie has the potential to be one of those generation-defining,0.0932365
movies of its time like you know when we look back on the 80s people,0.102216616
think of like what was that iconic teen movie of the 80s it was The,0.09956439
Breakfast Club 90s you have clueless you also had Dazed and Confused coming out of,0.29474288
the 90s even though that portrayed the high school experience in the 70s and then,0.052912727
the 2000s you have like Mean Girls and super bad those are iconic teen comedy,0.60454893
movies that really are classics of its genre and I feel like in 10-15 years,0.04616619
time when people are like oh what was it like to be a teenager in,0.093190216
2019 there reference book smart like I feel like that's how good this movie is,0.09123569
but at the same token I hope within the next couple of years that there,0.03586206
are going to be other movies that will portray a diverse range of coming-of-age experiences,0.0556771
for people of color because especially given the climate of 2019 since Hollywood is claiming,0.15386128
to be all about diversity I hope that those movies are actually going to be,0.09164511
made and I feel like all of the brown black kids growing up in 2019,0.5154597
deserve their own coming-of-age movies as well well that's about it for this video if,0.24064767
