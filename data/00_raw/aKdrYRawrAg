[Music] Java's anybody by guillermo del toro as directed masterpieces like Pan's Labyrinth The Devil's Backbone as well as disasters such as medic and blade too luckily for us this movie leans more towards a masterpiece than the disaster the shape of water is a sci-fi a dark fairy tale of a Liza play by Sally Hawkins a mute woman in 1960s Co or America who falls in love with an amphibian man that is the subject of this classified government experiment to join Eliza on her journey of becoming complete as her best friend Zelda played by Octavia Spencer who provides some well-timed comic relief to the film and she also plays Eliza's interpreter they have been cleaning this top-secret government facility for over a decade and built quite the friendship Richard Jenkins is in the movie - who was Eliza's neighbor in the shared apartment above a theater he probably is the closest to her as she is his confidant and vice-versa together all three of them pull off the heist of the century removing the amphibian man before the government flunky Michael general Zhai Shannon gets to destroy him there is a lot I like about this movie the movie is centered in 1960s and they used the music to kind of transform us into this era if you listen closely you could hear it in the background and I loved how the movie played with the color teal it's highlighted and if you pay attention to the characters everyone is wearing some kind of form of - the use of teal makes us kind of feel like we're watching a movie that's filmed underwater or inside a fish tank now in spite of the color teal this movie is full of colorful characters they help the movie move along where each character's story is showcased now everyone seems like they are relic born in a time that was too soon for them because they are living in this world that just rejects them just for being different they are all Outsiders in their own way and even the antagonist Malenko Generosa Shannon this government underling who is self-aware of his position he's mistreated and he wants more of his job but he know that what never happened Spencer's character Zelda which is one of my favorite gaming franchises by the way once more from her marriage and she wants to be treated more equally as she has to deal with not just sexism but some strong ratio undertones Eliza and her roommate both want people to love them and see them for who they really are Hawkins performance is breathtaking and she did it without even uttering a single word and through the glass half of the movie most people including myself were hanging on to her every sign doug jones has proven to be the andy serkis specializing in characters that do not need to talk with me to show their emotions with her body he does a great job playing this amphibian man and he's actually one of the leads in the movie that does not talk as well however it was Richard Jenkins who completely stole the show for me I enjoy seeing him interact not just with Eliza but within this world that has shunned him he's just at his court a sweet man with a particular fashion sense in this world with no taste he definitely deserves his Golden Globe nomination and I hope he get it for Best Supporting Actor in a motion picture the puppet master gueermo del Toro has proven that he knows how to tell a story with this contemporary tale of the mute and the beast it has a human element to it which makes the audience question what does it mean to be a human films that have this human element seem to resonate more with me because I love a movie that will actually make me think not to mention this is a limited budget movie that he turned into this cinematic masterpiece thinking about it it's actually a one-of-a-kind hybrid of a monster movie a spy movie a comedy and a musical where both the romantic leaves the Merman and the mute technically can't speak he deserves to win the Golden Globe now nation for Best Director and I hope he wins it now for the bed despite the numerous Golden Globe nominations for the shape of water this movie is far from perfect I mean and it indeed has an original story but the ending was as transparent as water early on there some heavy-handed foreshadowing where you can actually see how the movie was going to pan out I mean predictable endings are good but I was really hoping to be surprised with the ending with like a character arc or unexpected character departure regardless of the end and it is a beautiful one and it's a little bit on the romantic side now I know some people are gonna be like well I'm not cool with a woman trying to connect with a mer man but what about when a man tries to connect with mermaid I you know are you upset at that too I mean have you seen the Little Mermaid in the end the shape of water is definitely worth the price of admission it's a great date movie take your spouse take your loved one this movie cinematically checks off every book on my grading rubric with a original storyline great casting phenomenal acting and an ending that kind of ties everything together I would put this as Guillermo del Toro's second best film right behind Pan's Labyrinth which is my all-time favorite film from him as far as it getting a Golden Globe Award for being the best motion picture I enjoy three billboards outside of Evan Missouri a little bit better than this one so if you haven't seen it go check that one out is pretty good but sally hawkins should definitely get the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a motion picture actually captures our attention for the whole movie without uttering a word as always let me know what you thought of the movie in the comment section and if you're still here make sure you drop a like and click my face to subscribe because you are the real MVP and oh as a bonus I just got back from Verona Italy and if you want to see some of the pictures I took make sure you follow me on Instagram
