not my favorite hey what's up guys,0.27659515
my name is Steph Koza,0.059913382
and today I am reviewing the favorite,0.07254113
so the favor destructed by Y Argo slant the most I could 100% be pronouncing that incorrectly but he did the killing of a sacred deer the lobster dog tooth,0.36122206
and he's like a pretty well respected director like he's done some good stuff,0.07905433
this movie also stars Olivia Colman I'm a stone Rachel Weisz,0.163995
and if you watch the trailer you will 100% realize that this is Oscar bait to the nines like 100 percent Oscar bait movie it's set in early eighteenth-century England till about the Queen and her slaves and rich white people and Parliament Parliament Parliament,0.38496107
so you know Oscar bait no I have no problem with that I enjoy oscar movies obviously they win awards for reasons,0.123631
but there are often times some of them to come out,0.0823498
and you're just like,0.08696765
this was just created for the Academy and nobody else but basically it's about the Queen of England who has this very close friend Lady Sarah and she kind of runs things for the Queen,0.13866027
the Queen is just sort of like a figure and her friend Sarah basically governs the country in her stead then Emma stones character Abigail comes into the picture as a servant and the Queen begins to really like her and Abigail kind of tries to win her over,0.101336285
so it's Abigail and Lady Sarah kind of competing to be the favorite of the Queen and like it's interesting,0.09150083
there are some great scenes,0.03655053
there are some really great moments,0.035938915
some really funny moments,0.07869345
this movie was surprisingly funny and Emma Stone is of course wonderful and completely blew me away and I would not be surprised if she got an award for this movie Sam goes for Rachel Weisz who plays Lady Sarah,0.15188046
she was fantastic and Olivia Colman who was the queen and 100% stole the show like she just embodied that like kind of disgusting sort of stupid queen figurehead who doesn't really do anything and just like eats all day long she was very complex very interesting to watch and I I did enjoyed that part like the characters I enjoyed I loved watching them interact with each other,0.805033
they had a lot of very interesting unique scenes,0.05832584
but I did not really like this movie you take out a couple of the good moments,0.09673438
and like yeah I had fun watching those but as a whole I did not like this movie it was very very long or at least it felt super long it was also very boring like in between those good moments,0.14591561
were huge stretches of just like really boring talk about the English government,0.26858965
and like literally just Parliament Parliament Parliament this part of it that I was like I don't care about what you're saying,0.12460337
it's so boring,0.27902505
also I know I just said I liked all of the characters but I'm gonna take that back,0.05670845
I enjoyed the complexity of the characters I did not like the characters like when I watch a movie this could just be a personal preference but I like to have a character to like root for like,0.05210386
I want to be on someone's side,0.14988095
I want to like cheer someone on like,0.13624337
that's what I want to do,0.055081908
when I watch a movie I need someone to lead the way for me,0.08401237
this movie is just a movie about terrible disgusting people,0.69542736
and you like think you like one of them,0.113109306

I don't want to watch this movie anymore,0.13708827
it's just a bunch of and I get it like okay,0.25523365
it has a lot of merit and like as a film critic it's beautifully shot and the music is lovely,0.15427387
and the acting is great but it's just boring it didn't enjoy this movie it didn't make any sense,0.18759108
I have no idea what the purpose of this film was other than to be like look at these really rich annoying fat white people,0.72088724
I think the cinematography was a little bit pretentious,0.35166276
it was like also kind of weird,0.19154996
there's a lot of like fisheye wide-angle like really distorted wide-angle lenses and I know it's like they're trying to make these like people feel very alone in this huge mansion and like I get it it's all about like isolation and I get the metaphor but it just looked like a sum 41 music video from like 1993 and I was not about it just a very disorienting upsetting film and I don't ever want to watch it again it was also one of those movies where it's like,0.08396619
yeah no wonder everyone hates white people do you see everyone in this movie sucks,0.89646226
they're all a bunch of,0.16264977
but one tell that really gives away the fact that I did not enjoy this movie is when it ended first of all it ends very like abruptly and very weirdly like the whole movie up until the end is like you could follow it like it's fine,0.090770714
it's a movie and then there's just like this weird weird scene and I don't it was supposed to mean something,0.11215248
I'm sure if I like sat down and like truly analyzed it,0.16789496
maybe I would figure it out,0.11642459
but like I don't want to because I don't care but it was just very weird,0.13030383
and then it just ends and I was just sitting there looking up at the screen I was just like what just verbally just screaming at the screen what and I'm not alone because there were a lot of people in my theater and every single one of them also said what they were all just like what what what what what what just,0.14016576
