being the tramps usual bad luck and two being how work industries were changing possibly,0.07755177
for the worst at that time; businesses were replacing manual labor with machinery for the,0.034765158

of course being with the with the physical comedy- with the slapstick! You hear it,0.19375336
all the time that Charlie Chaplin was a comedic genius in the silent era and,0.02833882
I was hesitant to think that way because I'm not really a big fan of,0.021152839
"labeling directors as 'geniuses' or 'hacks' but having seen this movie, Charlie Chaplin really was",0.050700963
a comedic genius because of how great he was at selling a laugh without any,0.05353265
words whatsoever! It didn't matter if the gags were forced or obvious or so predictable,0.038293958
"that you could see them coming a mile away, what really matters and what was",0.021380998
Chaplin's greatest skill was his comedic timing and delivery because he and the other actors,0.04490522
have these exaggerated facial expressions that tell you everything you need to know about these,0.08726345
people without any dialogue whatsoever but never to a point where it felt cartoony or,0.06375453

impressive and made us understand these characters as people while still laughing at them because,0.0512371
"that's something that slapstick comedies often don't really understand: these sight gags, the reactions-especially matters",0.0940869
so much to the characters and in many cases the reactions matter more than the,0.012916536
pratfalls because the Tramp has 2 recurring reactions that really sum him up as a,0.1641294
character; one is this dumbfounded look of confusion that happens for two reasons-one of which,0.092503764
is when he's in the wrong place in the wrong time and he's in he's,0.05721178
"an innocent person who doesn't understand what's going on and he suffers for it, or",0.10787882

lashing out at each other and that's kind of the reason that makes the Little,0.05442333

"he realizes that he made any mistakes, he'll feel guilty about it-he'll want to help",0.03193547
anyone as quickly as possible and it's what leads him to making so many lasting,0.0781205
friendships in each of his movies. It's a character trope and it's a character personality,0.090159655

him as a character so much! But one of (for me) the best qualities about,0.047876593
this movie and something that I think gets overlooked about silent movies 'cause I don't,0.03504121
"hear people talk about this that much, the music! Chaplin was one of the few",0.030929044

didn't know how to do was read or write sheet music so whenever Chaplin knew,0.047379702
what each scene sounded like in his own head he would improvise some notes on,0.12605895

clearer idea of how to record the music and more importantly synchronize it to the,0.02453929

that these characters give or the much more somber and sad moments in the movie,0.027273195
"a lot more depth & tension whenever there's a pratfall, the music makes it seem",0.09967644
so whimsical & cheerful because what we're watching is funny but with the dramatic scenes-especially,0.024422882

makes it really hard to contribute colour symbolism to a black-and-white movie but Charlie Chaplin,0.099631205
really did find a way to make it work! Now as for problems I do,0.03471261
