admit that my knowledge of the subject was very minimal and basic. Iím sure quite,0.07580943

"of information. The Irishman is an ambitious and huge film, tackling a complex and layered,",0.1291131
decade-long story. One of the most interesting aspects for me was not only just how,0.045092776
"well the different time periods were used, but how they were integrated with one another.",0.025252612
We follow Frankís story through three distinct time periods: as an old man in the,0.09439383
"late 90s or early 2000s, recounting the story, as a middle-aged man in the mid-70s,",0.044386655
and as a young man just getting his start with the Bufalino crime family in,0.15490714
the late 50s and 60s. All three time periods are presented within the first few,0.04266673
"minutes of the film and the story is told in a semi-nonlinear way, frequently cutting",0.053416457
"between the time periods. Dates are never listed on screen, but old-man Frankís narration provides",0.09913269
"context to most of the transitions and, remarkably, it never gets confusing. The temporal context",0.029283961
"certainly helps with that, but the distinct visuals donít hurt either. The story spans nearly",0.07979914
"fifty years of Frankís life, so both deaging effects and old-age makeup are used quite",0.15030344
"effectively to show the passage of time. Speaking of time, I should probably mention the",0.06432507
aspect of this film thatís garnered the most attention in the months prior to its,0.0630756
release: its length. The Irishman is three and a half hours long. Iíd be lying,0.24006873
"if I said I didnít start to feel that length a bit, but it was",0.08519649
"never really to the detriment of the film. Keep in mind, gangster movies arenít my",0.34115562
"thing, so the fact that I only felt the length a bit is pretty amazing",0.082292624
and a testament to how engaging a movie it really is. There were a few,0.06076998
"dialogue-heavy scenes that got a little slow for me, but that was more a pacing",0.14336143
"issue than a consequence of the length. As big of a film as this is,",0.08448226

"top notch across the board. Robert De Niro is the clear standout for me, but",0.052876092

"humor present throughout. Itís certainly not a comedy, but it does have some entertaining moments",0.12607065
thanks to the editing style as well as Frankís narration. The Irishman was never gonna,0.095634684
"be a film for me, but I have no doubt that itís gonna go down",0.120379224
"as one of the greats of the genre. Alright, letís talk about the pros and",0.09320713
cons. Pro number one is the utilization of the time periods. A story as involved,0.054427706
as this one requires a lot of information. So much backstory and build-up is necessary,0.07805144
"for us to understand not only the events, but also the characters and their motivations.",0.031641055
"The multi-decade approach was the best way to tackle that, but it was also a",0.04465579
risky move. Nonlinear stories can be tough to get right and the need to age,0.04134079
"and deage actors only further complicates things. But, I really think this film pulls it",0.070241295
"off, not only from a technical standpoint, but also from a storytelling one, maintaining the",0.048723318
audienceís interest and understanding from one time period transition to the next. The second pro,0.04378893
has gotta be the performances. Iím sure this comes as no surprise given the stacked,0.15128216
"cast, but the acting was pretty phenomenal. Other than maybe Ray Romano, I never once",0.11004475

"based on a true story. Robert De Niro is the clear standout for me, but",0.052879415
"the whole cast really did an excellent job. On the con side, the only substantive",0.14946347
issue I had was the pacing. Iím sure many people will point to the filmís,0.10457772

"theater was a bit of a marathon, but I think this might actually be a",0.1858383
con thatíll disappear for Netflix viewers who have the option to pause and take short,0.17464684
breaks if necessary. Iím gonna give The Irishman 3.5 out of 5 paws. Itís a,0.09402522
very well-made and surprisingly interesting film that many will surely love. Gangster movies just arenít,0.15459067

"1960s as they relate to the mob. Plus, it also stars both Robert De Niro",0.051863685
and Al Pacino. I would also make the obvious recommendation of Goodfellas. It too focuses,0.072852544
on the mob over a series of decades and shares a number of crew and,0.07616051
