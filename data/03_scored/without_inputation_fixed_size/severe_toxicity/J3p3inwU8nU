Morales Miles Morales is one of the many people who has taken up the mantle,0.080994755
of spider-man and this movie follows the story of Miles as he becomes the spider-man,0.051030893
of his universe but then some sort of interdimensional happens and five other different spider,0.051549736
people all come into miles as universe and suddenly there's a bunch of spider men,0.2018114
spider people spider things so not only is Miles trying to figure out his own,0.05961642
powers and how to become his own Spider Man he's also dealing with all these,0.05287013
other spider people and trying to figure out what happened and how to send them,0.11130052
back and how to fix all the universes that are all melding together so there's,0.028948791
a lot happening in this movie it's kind of crazy and I loved it so,0.08813018
much first of all I love that we get an origin story of Spider Man,0.03797866
that we've never seen in a movie before because there have been a lot of,0.0326246
Spider Man movies at this point and it's like yeah we get it we know,0.04738835
the origin story of Peter Parker but nobody really knows the origin story of Miles,0.024681639
Morales unless you're like a huge comic book fan and he's read Miles Morales his,0.06326495
story but it was very refreshing and very cool to get a brand new origin,0.02885234
story for spider-man because Miles Morales is awesome I love him he's so lovable he's,0.068385534
such a great character I want so much more of him I'm so excited that,0.03249821
he has a movie and that it's a good movie I am just elated about,0.044653114
the existence of this film I also love that we get a lot of other,0.051116038
spider people in this movie like we do get Peter Parker we actually get two,0.071693495
different Peter Parker's one of which is probably my favorite character in the entire movies,0.010318994
played by Jake Johnson who I love a lot and he's basically from a dimension,0.04080702
where spider-man is kind of run down kind of old a little bit fat he's,0.36790854
kind of a shitty spider-man he's just not very good at it and I thought,0.72719085
that was such a cool perspective I love seeing a superhero just kind of being,0.02550181
a bum super relatable I am that spider-man and he was really funny I just,0.20155397
loved everything about him I would watch a whole movie of lame bum ass spider-man,0.74076116
eating pizza on the couch sign me up for that we also get gwen stacy,0.073591925
voiced by Hailee Steinfeld who I and I also love gwen stacy she is such,0.09397781
a huge fan favorite i feel like ever since she was born into existence which,0.041545376
was only a few years ago she has just exploded like I've seen people cosplaying,0.121266305
her everywhere her costume is really cool she's just a really awesome character and I,0.04707039
love her and she's incredible in this movie just like a really determined badass superhero,0.082629114
who's just gonna get done and she's gonna kick some ass and she has a,0.7639491
little bit of sass and I love it and then on top of that we,0.14140141
also have spider-man noir who is a really cool character I just started reading the,0.056918435
spider-man 2 our comics just because of this movie because he's really cool and he's,0.050911162
voiced by Nicolas Cage which is amazing and he made me laugh so much I,0.03365763
loved it and of course if that wasn't enough we also get Peter porker the,0.05515104
pig the spider pig the one and only spider-ham voiced by John Mulaney which makes,0.24605393
it even better because he's so funny and I just think the casting for this,0.08329496
movie was perfect like I cannot think of one person to be any other person,0.12325787
like they were all just like that was that was it that was perfect could,0.044653777
not do any better I've also got to talk about the style of this movie,0.028968748
the animation oh my god I don't think I have ever seen anything like this,0.053694956
in my life it was like it kind of looked like a comic book but,0.08966277
it was also a cartoon but it was mostly CG but it still had that,0.029341916
cartoon feel and like the way everything was shaded and colorized like it was just,0.05595658
so beautiful like even if the plot of this movie was terrible and everything about,0.096348524
it was terrible I probably still would have loved it just because visually it was,0.037427224
incredible it was like watching a comic book come to life in a way that,0.07237996
I never thought was possible I think they did a really good job of introducing,0.037871566
a lot of new characters into one origin movie and not making it feel overcrowded,0.03138403
or confusing or off-balance I feel like the balance was perfect the pacing was perfect,0.019473916
I got a lot from every character even spider-ham I like felt some sort of,0.047802757
connection with like every single character Doc Ock kingpin like the villains were really good,0.108802095
in this movie there were also like three different villains which is a lot of,0.03175786
villains especially when you also have a large on sample cast of protagonists like there,0.04399458
are a lot of characters in this movie and a lot of storylines going on,0.02449938
you have to kind of figure out in process and I felt like the balance,0.03226939
of those altogether was absolutely perfect I felt emotionally invested in every single spider person,0.042815875
I understood and even kind of felt for all 3 of the villains I got,0.05656456
enough of a backstory from Peter Parker and the other Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy,0.037032105
and miles and kingpin and everyone to be emotionally invested and care about them without,0.053973
getting too much backstory it was like just enough to care about them and to,0.032796215
see them develop and there is character development across the board for like everyone and,0.021605166
on top of that there are some badass fight scenes in this movie like the,0.13248728
animation style combined with the action choreography and the soundtrack and the sound effects everything,0.022579659
was so much fun I had so much I had a blast watching this movie,0.08344862
I can 100% tell you that this will have great replay value like I remember,0.02843261
after the credits rolled I was like when's the next show good could we could,0.028412655
we go see it right now is that cool cuz it was just so much,0.028404672
fun and it was funny and it was heartfelt and it had a lot of,0.0344319
everything that a movie needs it checked all the boxes it fit all of the,0.017611403
parts it was charming it was funny it was action-packed it was entertaining from beginning,0.06396539
to end and it left you feeling good I think the best superhero movies are,0.035637878
the ones that when they're over you feel like you're a superhero too and that's,0.034373365
what this movie did for me I think that's one of the perks of spider-man,0.073973745
and any spider-man story it's always about an underdog and feeling like you're kind of,0.07876373
a loser and you don't really know how to be a hero but that you,0.28452924
can be a hero and this movie 100% gave me that effect and I just,0.013318307
loved every web-slinging second of it spider-man into the spider verse has so much heart,0.057370093
and I am giving it five stars 100% I don't think I've had a lot,0.023576103
of movies in 2018 there were five stars but this just absolutely blew me away,0.046298113
I was so surprised at how good this movie was and it's probably in my,0.04018042
top 5 of 2018 I loved it so much and I truly cannot think of,0.04763779
any flaws like there was nothing that I had a problem with I thought everything,0.06726004
was perfect could not have been more perfect to this movie I I loved it,0.087470986
