good evening agents Bank darling as you may not know a new film called Mission,0.10167
Impossible fallout hits theatres this weekend it stars Tom Cruise Rebecca Ferguson Ving Rhames Simon,0.14840902
Pegg Alec Baldwin Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett it is the sixth installment to the,0.057896852
mission impossible franchise written and directed by the same man who wrote the last film,0.12655666
rogue nation Christopher McQuarrie it is said to be an action-packed thrill ride by most,0.27398843
people a local fat black YouTube critic known simply by the alias BCG is planning,0.7038277
on reviewing this movie and giving it some type of review your mission should you,0.09987011
choose to accept it is to watch this review in its entirety and see whether,0.05014086
or not he does a great job of reviewing the film or completely watches it,0.06358699
this recording will now self-destruct in five seconds good luck agent hey guys the bike,0.24020019
critic guy and I'm here today to review the sixth installment to the mission impossible,0.07112331
franchise mission impossible fallout so the story for Mission Impossible fallout is relatively similar to,0.031845983
the one for rogue nation Ethan Hunt and his crew have to locate this secret,0.31089434
evil organization this time the call of the Apostles and stop them from obtaining 2-tone,0.35769615
iam in order to create a nuclear weapon to cause wanton destruction and while on,0.26406226
the way they face many obstacles like mi6 agents getting in their way the CIA,0.10844299
meddling with them once again and also being on their own and doing the impossible,0.10468392
god I cannot believe that this is the sixth installment to the mission impossible franchise,0.10027272
and that's been going on for this long keep in mind the first film of,0.07576396
this franchise came out in 1996 1996 22 years ago it still stars two of,0.07950604
the same actors from that film Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames have been in every,0.1325832
single Mission Impossible film and Ethan Hunt has always been the main character I mean,0.08628213
my goodness that is bonkers but the beauty of this franchise is that somehow some,0.27148247
way they get better with age it started with Ghost Protocol then it was followed,0.09519945
up by rogue nation which is still my favorite Mission Impossible film in the franchise,0.22511761
and now here we are with fallout which I personally find to be a solidly,0.043138564
made entertaining action blockbuster I noticed something very fascinating in regards to this latest installment,0.12697078
that being this is the truest sequel to any of the Mission Impossible films what,0.08886763
do I mean by that well basically whatever they make a new Mission Impossible film,0.11623719
that film does not directly connect or correlate to the previous installment it's its own,0.060332645
self-contained story but has the same characters from previous films so it's loosely connected but,0.046548314
it doesn't continue the same narrative whereas in Fallout it is a direct continuation -,0.06087077
rogue nation as it carries on the same narrative has many of the same characters,0.20801952
that were introduced in rogue nation and actually gives some closure to some of the,0.14190492
things that was presented in rogue nation not to mention that it was also written,0.16553374
directed by the same guy and I believe that Mission Impossible fob being a direct,0.09981262
sequel to rogue nation is both a good thing and a troubling thing as well,0.4616375
and I'll get into that later on one thing that this franchise continues to excel,0.19343264
at is creating gripping intense and thrilling action sequences and that is no exception here,0.0737126
in fallout as once again the action is the best thing about this film and,0.08702347
it just continues to build upon itself from one action scene to the next and,0.07249622
something that I don't think I praise enough about the mission impossible franchise is it's,0.05970748
variety in its action sequences from fist fights to gun fights to knife fights to,0.14967054
freaking car chases there's a helicopter chase in this film and even a rope battle,0.5154597
yeah there's actually a fight where our characters are fighting with each other with ROS,0.08051925
I mean I gotta give them props for being so creative and varied with their,0.07155623
action sequences they can always just do action scenes where characters are punching each other,0.24170794
or they're just chasing each other down but sometimes they intermingle sometimes as a fist,0.29301414
fight mixed in with a car chase scene or a car tasting mixed in with,0.15533602
some gun fighting or just multiple things happening in the action sequences that keep it,0.12088663
refreshing and interesting one thing that truly complements the action sequences in this film is,0.07580689
the creative use of the camera the camera moves so phonetically that it complements these,0.15503655
action sequences I don't think there's a single shot of the spill or the camera,0.10176915
is not staged still and it's not that shakey cam either it's very clean and,0.065647356
precise camera movements that you can see the action unfolding right in front of you,0.08962417
this is how you feel action people can you just take a class with Christopher,0.108577356
McQuarrie and his cinematographer so you understand how to shoot action this is how you,0.33394894
shoot action I think it should go does saying that I thoroughly enjoyed most of,0.54452175
the performances in this film again some were better than others and others were completely,0.05109723
wasted but for what they had to do most of them did a excellent job,0.15107508
particularly Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson who were the strongest performances in this film I,0.073103055
mean Tom Cruise really delivers both in the action sequences and in some of these,0.054260906
emotional scenes where he's talking to characters you really buy the emotion and I really,0.09281209
feel like Tom Cruise whenever he does a Mission Impossible film he puts his best,0.07667735
foot forward because this is his franchise this is his baby and he wants to,0.24094564
make sure that we he makes a great product and that requires him giving a,0.05291791
excellent performance and he does deliver once again and I must I must admire his,0.07287473
dedication to his craft both in his performance and pulling off his stunts and age,0.13596867
50 something the fact that he's still doing many of these stunts is freakin impressive,0.49587446
and there are some stunts in this film that I wonder whether or not they,0.055972908
did this in real life or did they do it in a studio in a,0.080113664
green-screen because I couldn't tell look the real look so natural it looked like it,0.062412415
was naturally lidded and it made me study okay is that a green screen or,0.07264052
does that actually being shot outside and could not put my finger on it and,0.34659863
I've gotta give props to the special effects Department the lighting departments and the cinematography,0.06390196
for tricking me into believing that it was real if it wasn't I also really,0.080698214
liked the performance of the main villain from the previous film and again they kept,0.095774144
his character intact he's still as methodical and strategic as he was in ground nation,0.11771527
it was to delight to see them again as I still think is the best,0.090057
villain in the mission impossible franchise and seeing him in this film it clearly shows,0.12487417
I truly adore how they handled Ethan and Ilsa's relationship in this film because it,0.06358869
easily could have came off as hokey or fors or way too over-the-top to the,0.0948687
point where you're like that's not even what their relationship was like in the previous,0.12475467
film but no they understood these two characters to their core and understood the dynamic,0.07505135
of their relationship and they executed it near flawlessly I think the beauty about their,0.3484748
relationship especially in this film is that you can really sense the conflicting emotions both,0.08223744
of them dealt with between picking their mission or choosing to protect the other their,0.06977938
chemistry is just so on point and I've been rooting for this relationship since Rome,0.052379858
nation because so first I remember I felt like Ethan had an equal Elsa is,0.0869105
his equal she's not some damsel that needs to be saved she's not just some,0.15139134
stoic badass she's a character with complex emotions a deep rich backstory and has their,0.35803235
own motivations and can protect herself but unfortunately guys I do have a couple issues,0.1364851
in regards to Mission Impossible fall out my biggest problem comes with its story while,0.10066207
the story was engaging I can't help but notice after thinking about it that it,0.059015386
does kind of feel like a retooled version of rogue nation story as it follows,0.27288833
a lot of the same beats I mean really sit back and reflect upon the,0.04897792
stories of the previous instalments in comparison to fallout yeah Ethan Hunt and his team,0.05611196
who have to find locate and stop an evil terrorist organization that is bent on,0.4147095
destroying the old world order in order to bring in a new world order which,0.41940784
is very similar to the plans of the syndicates who were the main antagonists of,0.0800185
the previous film not to mention that the head of the syndicate is also a,0.10322691
vocal part of the story here in fallout and is also one of the main,0.040960148
buildings not to mention that once and the CIA is on IMSS a war watch,0.2398721
you guys in deadly they did the same thing in rogue nation the CIA was,0.3394387
investigating hi I'm Evan saying oh my god what are you guys doing we're watching,0.07046955
you guys and how many times can we disavow Ethan Hunt I mean they don't,0.15060976
bring it up later on in the film like how many times will this guy,0.103715524
be disavowed you know until he finally breaks and I thought that was gonna be,0.103118464
an interesting focal point but the thing is you've established this character for the past,0.06904609
22 years there's no way you're going to trick the audience into believing that he's,0.08219985
all of a sudden become evil now so it just felt like fluff to pad,0.23286767
out the story to make it run a bit longer I mean I guess it's,0.089332506
kind of a case of it ain't broke don't fix it as it is working,0.091427594
form the mission impossible franchise but I think after a while and it's been more,0.066046044
than 20 years people are gonna grow sick and tired of this same concept and,0.17943494
they're gonna want something new and refreshing so I want you to keep that in,0.09759236
the back of your mind people handling the mission impossible franchise you might want to,0.16172637
mix it up in the next installment another main issue that I had with the,0.056691438
film deals with the other antagonists played by Henry Cavill who did I spoil and,0.064481825
a few guys oh my god I'm so sorry I mean it's not like it,0.14863366
was so obvious from the get-go that he was gonna be the felon oh I,0.2419124
I can't believe I ruined that for you guys I'm so sorry please as if,0.24022989
none of us knew that he was gonna play the secret Finland in Mission Impossible,0.1278862
follow me from the moustache so the fact that he's even in the damn film,0.76853716
you could probably surmise what kind of character he's gonna play he's either gonna play,0.09098723
a character replacing jeremy renner who's not in the film which i seriously doubted or,0.092206724
be he's gonna be the surprise villain the one pulling the strings all along and,0.16354708
if you chose B you're correct not to mention that the trailers also give away,0.10895729
the fact that he's probably going to play an antagonist considering there are shots in,0.08557242
the trailer where he's going toe-to-toe against Ethan Hunt so you like put two two,0.2527298
two together okay he's probably gonna be like this big reveal supervillain oh I will,0.20752668
say they actually do a really good job at playing of the twist with another,0.07744628
twist kind of like a reverse twist in the sense so I like that so,0.117634065
I guess they were kind of like yeah we know you know he's gonna be,0.07143805
the villain win so it's pretty obvious we made it pretty clear he's gonna be,0.18998763
the villain so they didn't twist on that whole concept and I'm like okay no,0.13238251
huge sports film but the fact of the matter stands is that as a villain,0.13559733
he's just not that interesting or that intimidating yeah he's Henry Cavill he's Superman he's,0.28725034
big strong and tough but he just comes off as a must fist totally villain,0.52579033
which is kind of suitable considering that he does have a mustache it would have,0.28756407
been funny if they just owned it and had him twirling his mustache they're like,0.4093702
saying the boy is going perfectly that I would have accepted that although probably wouldn't,0.069858685
fit the realistic tone that the film was trying to go for so I understand,0.0727778
but I just didn't care about him as a character I didn't find him all,0.081526846
that intimidating I mean ya can handle himself in an action scene to a certain,0.08522908
degree but other than that like there's nothing really remarkable about it he just he,0.09980183
fades into the background and lastly I personally felt that Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin,0.057401545
were completely wasted in this film I wish they were given more to do I,0.16265497
wish they had more weight to them especially with Angela Bassett because it seemed like,0.08523366
they were gonna do something interesting with her but then she ends up being like,0.16336545
that one CIA agent that's always on the inss and when she reminds me of,0.07995407
that one guy from the first film that is technically still a good guy but,0.05419443
he's always antagonizing Ethan Hunt he's like I want you Ethan okay I'm coming for,0.30374083
you you've done bad naughty naughty and I'm like can't we give Angela Bassett a,0.40315726
more meaty role can she can she actually contribute something interesting to the plot I,0.15514967
still really enjoyed watching Mission Impossible fall out is a great continue - rogue nation,0.37292764
and while it's not as good as rogue nation I will say that it's definitely,0.28255385
worth watching if you're a fan of the mission impossible franchise of your battle rogue,0.31669638
nation check this one out but as always guys I'm not the end-all be-all opinion,0.16200258
when it comes to Mission Impossible fallout I would love to know what you guys,0.12561594
thought of the film as well did you find an exhilarating fun and exciting to,0.070475034
watch like my boring dull repetitive I just can't get into any more and I,0.20502912
wish that they would kill the mission impossible franchise already and do we know what,0.43205774
is one of your favorite franchises that have been going on for more than 20,0.06931368
