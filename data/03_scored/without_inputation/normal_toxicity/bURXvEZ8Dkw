that's why first thought of when I saw this creature and she builds a connection and relationship with this creature because he sees her for who she is he doesn't understand that she is mute and she can't speak,0.31089434
so he doesn't have that idea about her,0.14823817
so there she builds this connection because she really feels like she is missing something in her life,0.16602682
she feels like she is just not part of something and having this creature in her life it kind of fills that void and makes her feel a part of something,0.31089434
