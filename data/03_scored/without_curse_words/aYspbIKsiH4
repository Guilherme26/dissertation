down parasites at nauseam doing the deep dive so really I can't offer you anything,0.5876557
here that you haven't already heard except for my personal opinion I guess you haven't,0.104595214
heard that yet that that's the thing in this video you can't find anywhere else,0.1099284
you can find my face this face hey you clicked on it parasite is a,0.5585537
South Korean film but what it's about okay it's like this like I know the,0.079531096
director bong joon-ho I saw him say the best way to go into this movie,0.13931629
is cold so I'm gonna give you a non spoiler warning basically I'm gonna do,0.15128906
that first act setup that I do in any review where it's kind of like,0.038854245
oh here's kind of what the movies about all right cut off before we start,0.16418688
getting into spoilers and here's what I think about the movie so out of respect,0.12124705
for him and his work and the fact that he would want you to go,0.08367314
into the movie cold not knowing anything I'm gonna let you know alright I'm gonna,0.08676487
kind of let you know where the movie heads if you don't want to even,0.2660208
know that long story short you should see parasites great but the movies about this,0.59485376
family living in poverty and the son gets the opportunity to be an English tutor,0.11264809
for this rich family's daughter and then he's like hey I know someone who could,0.15472719
be an art instructor for your son and then he kind of weasels his sister,0.6303403
into it the whole family just kind of weasels their way into this rich family's,0.48419246
house and of course the rich family doesn't know they're all related so it's this,0.1103114
whole they're hustlers it's a scheme going on and that kept the movie really engaging,0.2547154
even intense when there wasn't necessarily an intense moment but it's always on your mind,0.09069564
like are you guys but the movie is definitely about classism and the rich versus,0.116301775
the poor and the way this movie breaks it down and portrays it's pretty genius,0.1808884
I mean that's not even all there is in the movie I mean it's about,0.10429256
social class social status this side versus that side yes but it's not even limited,0.105206296
to just that to the point not to sound redundant but it's a movie about,0.05824692
human beings how we treat each other versus how we view each other how we,0.35362262
don't even think it's well here but it does it in a way that's fun,0.108843595
so it's weirdness out loud but the movie is actually quite fun in its execution,0.33223924
it's funny it's whimsical it's fun but also turns up the drama it's relevant it's,0.08957487
actually dark thought-provoking this movie has a scene that goes from fun to very intense,0.11250652
to pretty dark and tragic not every filmmaker can pull that off without having conflicting,0.1484426
tone there's a scene with a storm that wonderfully illustrates like how the two families,0.095899984
deal with it and what it means to them and it just it puts it,0.07566136
all into perspective for it's a kid this is actually a true story I was,0.060779795
young I was no older than 11 or 12 and remember this girl she was,0.23109414
younger she was in the single digits probably eight or nine so she's younger than,0.08232953
me this is in church and we were all all these kids were pumps cuz,0.18197626
we were like yeah there might not be any school tomorrow there's gonna be snow,0.106593005
yeah no school and snow we're gonna play in the snow is gonna be fun,0.05797438
but I remember her saying it's easy to say that but what about all the,0.051030137
poor and homeless people and they're gonna freeze and that's it's easy to see it,0.24245918
your way but what about how they experience it true story and this is the,0.043039363
90s you know what's in social media around it it was like this kid just,0.08314494
goes to church anyhow there's a part in this movie that kind of illustrates the,0.12994905
same thing with weather and it just took me right back to that that time,0.08707892
when I was a kid that a younger kid taught me that lesson that parasite,0.5618885
sillas wild world and it's one of the impressive things about this movie more than,0.13508046
a few times I've seen a movie have a message but it's like the movie,0.06050509
relies on its message to carry the entire thing so it's like off the message,0.11412559
doesn't hit you it's what do you have now what do you have for a,0.11392624
movie what do you have for a film what do you have for entertainment but,0.09800507
this movie if you want to see the message and you definitely it's there I,0.08820065
mean at a point you you can't not see it anymore but the movie itself,0.11688233
message aside is remarkably entertaining it's like a dark drama comedy it's a dark dramedy,0.24642584
more movies fail at that then succeed at that and parasites one of the ones,0.65608656
that does succeed in that and astronomy we call that the Goldilocks zone God give,0.14206001
props to Kang ho song I believe that's how you pronounce his name might be,0.16522607
a couple of mispronunciations in here but that dude everyone in the movie does a,0.101265535
great job I thought they were all fantastic but when I think of the cast,0.095498644
like he's the one who stands out he was amazing I'm actually really shocked he,0.06882301
wasn't nominated for an Oscar but dude just crushes it I thought it was great,0.10976016
it's definitely one of those movies you need to do a second pass like after,0.080160014
you watch it you should probably watch it again because when you start realizing how,0.091318876
the movies addressing what it's addressing and how it's breaking it down cool to go,0.10666521
back and watch the movie again and see how it does it from the beginning,0.05888089
up until the point you actually kind of it gripped you with an implication does,0.15600339
that mean I watch this movie twice but yep there's no real rush to get,0.07956882
my review out so yeah I watched it twice I was glad I watched it,0.11467774
twice I appreciated it more the second time cuz in the end I thought parasite,0.44497404
was great I'm not one of those people's like Oscars are the end-all be-all but,0.33598647
if you're working in that industry they kind of are for you and your career,0.059155133
so I know everybody's touched on it but seeing the look on bong Joon Ho's,0.1516426
face when he won the Oscar for I believe it was Best Screenplay there's smile,0.053955823
on his face puts a smile on my face the spectrum of people after they,0.4032781
watched parasite it's like it's the movie of the decade or it was great whether,0.40328148
or not it's the film of the decade film of the year or just a,0.04704521
great movie that's a different conversation most agree it's a solid move it's great it's,0.059327964
well-made it's engaging it's well acted there's definitely worth watching definitely worth buying on blu-ray,0.093107104
right so parasite have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you,0.6568917
thought comment below let me know and as always if you liked what you've seen,0.12560783
