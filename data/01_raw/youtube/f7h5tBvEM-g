[Music] spider-man into these spider-verse is the 2018 animated film it's about Miles Morales and all of these alternate universe spider people all mixing together to take down the kingpin and this weird super collider science gizmo he's built to open a tear in the various parallel dimensions I have to say as someone who reads a lot of spider-man comics I hate these multi-dimensional Spiderman stories usually they're usually messy and convoluted and dumb but what's surprising about this movie is that it totally works and it is fantastic and it's great very surprising that they were able to pull off this multiverse spider-man story and do such a good job with it this has got to be one of the best spider-man films it is just such a joy to watch now I'm gonna be talking some spoilers in this movie I'm not going to give away the overall plot but I am gonna be talking about the various spider people and the various actors and what characters they play so if you don't want that swirled for you then skip this review until you've seen the movie now let's get into it this movie was directed by three people so we got Bob / Shetty Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman Peter directed this movie rise of the guardians but a lot of them have really worked on a lot of different animated films or doing the storyboards on other films so they really do bring a lot of this visual prowess to the movie and this movie looks great the animation style is so unique I've never seen another animated film that look like this the visuals are really top-notch in this movie in fact this movie really couldn't be told with like in live-action or just using cartoons it really kind of needed this animation style to really tell those best story possible there's these scenes in this super collider that's like room where these you know lasers are firing and this parallel dimension is opening and just the way they portrayed it it's something that we just work in another kind of form so they really did a top-notch job on that now this movies written by Phil Lord who wrote the lego movie so we get a lot of that humor that you see present in the lego movie present in this movie also written by Rodney Rothman who wrote 22 Jump Street and he was a writer on The Late Show with David Letterman for a really long time so you really see those comedic sensibilities present in this movie now let's talk about the cast such a fun cameo of different actors brought into this movie and all these different spider people very great stuff okay so we have Miles Morales who is really the star of this film in the main person you follow he's played by shameik Moore who some of you might know from the movie dope and he was great in this he's really great at narrowing in on that like Brooklyn african-american Latino kind of voice and he really brought some great personality to miles he did a fantastic job we have Jake Johnson as this older Peter Parker and he was really fun really uh great voice to him really interesting then this Peter Parker this older Peter Parker I'm not gonna spoil exactly what this version of Peter is but I was very interested in this character and this world and I really wanted to follow that version of Peter Parker a lot more really interesting stuff they have Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy you might remember Hailee from the new bubble movie movie that just came out and she was really fun as Gwen Stacy in this we got Marcela Ali from green book as well as Brian Tyree Henry some of you might know him from the TV show Atlanta and both of them are playing miles dad and uncle and both of them were pretty great in this movie got Lily Tomlin as Aunt May she was a pretty fun addition to the cast we have zoe kravitz as mary jane we have John Mulaney as this spider-ham that he's like a Looney Tunes version of spider-man that's enough Pig so it's like a pig Looney tune spider-man really funny in this movie John mulaney's just has a great voice really brings the humor this character was so funny he often would when he's fighting would use like a cartoon anvil and drop it on people and have like a cartoon mallet that he uses as a weapon really fun stuff we have now I didn't recognize his voice when I was watching the movie was until afterwards that I found this out but there's a Spider Man O'War character which is like a 1930s black and white version of spider-man in this newer kind of world and the voice actor was Nicolas Cage as this guy which was just really funny then we have Liev Schreiber as the kingpin now the kingpin is my one negative in this movie I really did not like the portrayal of the kingpin and I really didn't dig the voice choice it sounded too much of like an Italian mafia boss whereas I don't really see the kingpin that way per se also I did not like the way the kingpin was drawn he's so out of proportion to what a normal human looks like which I guess the kingpin kind of does look like that normally but I really did not dig that and the kingpin also seemed a little bit too powerful in this movie when he's fighting spider-man and I also wasn't really digging the kingpins motivations for everything and a lot of that in this film this movie is just really fun is really great seeing the origin story from Miles Morales and seeing his interaction with his parents and we throw all these alternate spider people in here and Gwen Stacy's Alice story was pretty interesting then we have these two Peter Parker's and I just want movies on all these different spider people thrown into the mix now I would have been fine if we just left it at that for the spider people once we throw in the spider-man Noire and the spider ham and then there was this Japanese Spider Girl which it has this robot and maybe that was a little bit too much but I mean it's still really fun throwing them into the mix overall I really liked this movie my only negatives are the kingpin and as well as maybe was a little bit too jokey at times but still this is a fantastic movie one of the best movies of the year definitely in the top 10 or top 20 I would give this movie 8.5 out of 10 totally worth seeing check it out [Music]
