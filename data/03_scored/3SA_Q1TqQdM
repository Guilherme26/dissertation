call him him what does that mean on the site just got in from seeing,0.15185288
the Wonder Woman movie let me give a quick shout-out to the man who sang,0.21166693
that I ran into that was running the concession stand what's happening man he asked,0.096219644
me what I thought after the movie I said once my overview he's like alright,0.085546136
so the whole premise of the movie is you know Trevor said his name there's,0.0362943
a Steve I can't remember a way it's no ruin all feminists Keira eyelid I,0.49513015
think we've seen this in the trailer she finds him resuscitates him but he resuscitates,0.16384208
himself basically the amazons find out from him that there is a war going on,0.17986895
and now Diana wants to help stop the war she believes that Ares is the,0.15011281
cause of this war if she's heard of a special weapon on them as scare,0.37436485
and she wants to take this women weapon and she wants to slay Ares to,0.7093121
stop this war and to stop all these millions of people from dying around the,0.400116
planet and then we have our story I would like to say that as far,0.07630367
as this movie goes I thought that all the actors were good I thought that,0.10977188
all the actors were good I did I didn't have a problem the acting whatsoever,0.12810236
and I thought a gal gadot did a great job as being one whine the,0.25337458
banter between her and Trevor Steve found the lie and keep mixing up the names,0.2498773
but I think it's Trevor could be Steve I think is Trevor for all you,0.027705941
nlgger psychos out there they're like oh the name of the guy wrong nlgger you,0.794439
okay so what oh so I thought of acting was fine I thought Gallagher and,0.15745883
I did a great job the banter between them too was good during the movie,0.11176702
there was a lot of I'm not of your world what is this type of,0.24056412
jokes what does that mean type of jokes you know for stepping my bounds as,0.086580224
a woman the only things that'll want to doesn't do in your world a lot,0.35475072
of those jokes in there visually it looked very similar to a Zack Snyder movies,0.13521144
to color grading and the grit and just the way everything looked looked like something,0.05970184
similar to his Boonton his you know movies okay I know it wasn't directed by,0.20443854
him but you could see that they were made trying to make everything seamless in,0.08692604
between these movies that are in the Snyder verse they all have a particular look,0.069297835
his look and I could see that I would say that the movie was slow-moving,0.20087835
the first half but not boring that makes sense you slow but not boring ah,0.10939044
the action was good when it was getting good one thing in particular I had,0.071921684
a homosexual couple that was sitting to my left right next to me and they,0.5404245
one of them in particular made it very hard need to concentrate on particular action,0.09971179
sequences because when the action sequences got on particularly the first major action sequence it's,0.05371273
in the trailer which breaks the gun and all that stuff this dude was killing,0.5570097
me I'm kidding you're trying it really goodness he's okay kept doing it was just,0.09929902
driving me nuts but wet so anyway um our action sequences were good um movie,0.49394158
was longer than I thought was going to be certain people died I anything with,0.3029369
us docking and uh I would say that she was wonder what throughout the movie,0.11450697
she was she was funny she was sexy she was strong she was powerful she,0.45788988
was fast she was basically everything that I wanted her to be so I can,0.104834035
say that I'm very happy with the Wonder Woman character pretty much in how they,0.088069536
portrayed her the movie has comedic moments a little campy sometimes but it had its,0.116779424
moments had action pretty much a lot of what I was looking for you know,0.096911415
there's like an X Factor did they tell you make someone great what is it,0.11282216
X Factor here down that is keeping me from absolutely loving this movie I'm not,0.14993787
sure exactly what it was I don't know if it was the pacing or I,0.07795518
told you it was slow but not boring like I don't love it but I,0.1551106
don't hate the movie either I'm ok with it that's how I feel you know,0.09510819
I'm going to give it three out of five wolves and uh this is going,0.23399241
to be mullet style so let's start talking mullet which means spoilers ok review in,0.105892584
the front spoiler zooming back that's my mother's style I ain't expectin the dude to,0.15326257
die I expect that but then again it was all those years ago she's a,0.44111094
god so okay well that rep set up next to me known as Han um,0.10320942
Ares was Magneto don't tell me he wasn't he was magneto magneto okay a funny-looking,0.1919869
type of magneto because he said you know Scotland Yard bushy mustache like it's like,0.36931643
he totally threw me off and way this was the God of War the Lord,0.27484187
the God of War looks like um she did fly a little bit her Nerys,0.5849594
did their little levitation thing I think if we saw her levitate like twice especially,0.16043611
when she rained down and you know took his power and send it back to,0.18141171
him she was she was in there floating levitating that flight as far as I'm,0.30054495
concerned and at the end she was flying I'm sorry that was flight that wasn't,0.07283392
a Hulka jump anywhere she's flying wherever she wanted to go uh y'all can argue,0.15426837
with me all you want I don't give a nlgger you know I'd oh so,0.47502583
I guess the true test will be when Justice League comes along we see her,0.061393745
fly in Justice League then we noticed she's able to fly we know that's how,0.07983987
she dropped in front of Batman that's how she dropped it from him she flew,0.1617055
there I don't care she flies on planes when she's doing business she used her,0.25192037
superpowers to get over there and she flew okay oh I did like just I,0.086810745
did like that first scene I like that first scene where she got into the,0.091443956
war the first part was a little extra theatrical I mean when she stepped up,0.23308407
the ladder zpn and pin and the gay dude messed it up for me again,0.80100137
about oh well you just can't do hopefully man you are nlgger killing this for,0.6872448
me so I guess he's a diva watching addy but so he was happy so,0.1536158
um I'm watching this and you know she's gonna do peeling Peru now was it,0.10298878
- personally I just normally was over the top for me over-the-top theatrics you know,0.09997117
whatever you may think of what I like I don't care because it's like there's,0.110882364
certain things that work for me and certain things I don't some of you will,0.1818811
hear me give a review on something they label you didn't like this but you,0.15484796
like this that has nothing to do with this he's even I'm saying so I'm,0.14878836
talking about Wonder Woman right now and certain things in their context and how they,0.083524436
were done in other movies we ain't talking about that with this movie and yeah,0.07711998
I know some of y'all do that with certain things and you know you don't,0.079607025
get it you know think properly you just relate one thing the other a little,0.07708006
superhero sir if you like this that means you have to like this that's not,0.13388354
well how how life works that's not how my minds work anyway so once she,0.12588234
started getting on the field and she had the shield and everything that was a,0.09542997
cool sequence you know in Trevor or Steve Trevor got on there with his mentor,0.04649419
took out the Germans and then when she got in there and she started nlgger,0.5531385
all them soldiers up that was very very reminiscent of the warehouse scene with Batman,0.110657044
very I live really did that was that was her that was her Batman warehouse,0.19063745
scene lonely you know ones and um as far as the crowd I'm going to,0.14235409
talk about the crowd I would like to say other than the gay dudes next,0.7391097
to me go low whoo I didn't hear anything throughout the movie I didn't hear,0.09890315
any cheers I personally didn't cheer myself until be it I think everyone was happy,0.11579995
with the product and with the movie and you know they were like damn at,0.5899224
least you made it you know yeah I think everybody you know yeah but I,0.1028053
gotta say when I'm thinking of the movies where you know I'm thinking of the,0.07480834
vvvv DC universe movies that I've seen start from Man of Steel I don't remember,0.06322417
hearing any cheering in Man of Steel until the end also although I was chairing,0.09293601
doornail I thought I was doing my crazy maniacal laughter whoo certain things I was,0.40322182
watching I was grinning ear-to-ear watching a lot of that and then um that may,0.09395682
be Superman I remember three times specifically people cheering during the whole Batman V Superman,0.06580844
fight the the Batman warehouse fight and when when Wonder Woman showed the nlgger up,0.37247285
and at the end and at the end sorry so four times I remember the,0.053419396
crowd cheering during that movie okay Wonder Woman it wasn't till the end and Suicide,0.53490317
Squad none there's no cheering at all I ain't hear any cheers at all so,0.05615687
I'm now it depends on where you go you know certain places you go people,0.10100195
and give a nlgger you know and all that so you know I understand in,0.48833638
my area I'm telling you my movie going experience okay if I had to rate,0.13439813
all the movies together I'm going to go with all the the the the DC,0.08611727
Cinematic Universe movies not counting Green Lantern of course I'm going to go with Batman,0.078488104
V Superman first for me um then man is steel and then Wonder Woman and,0.106636986
then Suicide Squad so those all the three of those are my top three I,0.60653585
enjoyed watching all three uh but um you know it's you know the I told,0.06052395
you I just did not like Suicide Squad at all Wonder Woman it gets a,0.31281158
pass for me if I really great it would be a see you know it's,0.11914224
just something about it it wasn't great to me but I thought it was still,0.10502963
a good job but I'm not I'm not exactly calling it average maybe I will,0.08531719
call it a C+ you know what I mean I'm not I liked a lot,0.15438761
of it but some of it I sat like this fool out of the movie,0.7694366
I did they were just certain disconnects that didn't exactly work from me but I,0.0778876
was still pleased with the product I was still pleased with it but I wasn't,0.07187593
overly happy like I was you know um you know with like a remaining steel,0.09197182
and then when especially Batman V Superman I was very pleased very pleased but uh,0.1156724
I don't know I just I think they did a good job making our Wonder,0.08450184
Woman for today and I'm happy and I can't wait to see her and the,0.29171756
Justice League and mr. Snyder please put the rest whether she can fly it not,0.07453595
okay I don't care what who said in an interview or not okay because we,0.18715768
know they did movie makers and actors be nlgger with us in interviews and then,0.19069907
eventually stuff Adams in the movies in like wait a minute I thought you said,0.08029181
so um she was lying on to me levitation is flight okay far as I'm,0.19430222
concerned levitation is flight okay like nlgger you floating for alright and at the end,0.43163505
