hey guys,0.05914233
so I feel like I haven't filmed in like a million years just plethora of reasons and I apologize this video is so late I actually saw this movie really late I saw it like five or six days after it was even released so but we're here now we're doing the review,0.06470117
now I hope that you will still be interested at this point hopefully you've seen the movie because most of this video is going to be all about the spoilers and just the movie in general and like the theories the just you know the details about the film because it's really hard to review it without spoilers but there will be a chunk at the beginning of this video where I do review it if you have yet to see it whether or not I recommend it,0.06099286
also I just wanna say today's makeup is inspired by the movie so apparently all you have to do to look a little bit more jarring is to remove your eyebrows,0.32695544
so I'm rocking my natural eyebrows today also another thing I got new glasses so you're gonna see me rocking some glasses a lot more in videos,0.16023347
and last thing I want to talk about before,0.103349134
we get into the review is you might have seen a bunch of other horror creators talk about this,0.25229028
and I'm really late to jump on this bandwagon but I did really want to mention it because it's so exciting,0.092953324
and I'm so pumped about it it's currently an 80s horror documentary project that's being created right now and is being funded on IndieGoGo,0.10939686
I will have a link to it down below it's called in search of darkness,0.12128737
and it's backed by people like John Carpenter Elvira just back to today painting hotter and a plethora of other horror icons in this community but I'm so excited because we get a true thorough 80s horror documentary which i think is one of the best decades for horror,0.18702431
and arguably one of the most important decades of horror today is actually the last day to back it I know I apologize,0.15526146
I'm so late on announcing this but hopefully you've seen other creators talk about it,0.09099738
and you've already backed it and gotten the perks but I will have a link of course,0.079237334
and I'm not sponsored to say that by the way it isn't affiliate link,0.05757317
though I do want to disclose that,0.041065555
so now let's get into the us review there is so much to unpack with this movie and I can tell you right,0.08398045
now I'm not going to cover every single detail every twist and every sim aspect of symbolism in the spell there's just no way that I can get into that,0.08853105
so I'm gonna talk about my favorite things about the film and my favorite kind of forms of symbolism and commentary and things like that so just gonna go over the ones that I find the most interesting about the film but of course there's going to be literally so many more things about this,0.054660037
and there's so many videos already made about all the things little easter eggs within this movie that you can check out,0.08950943
and also just do a google search and you there's tons of articles about it,0.13781989
so if you want more details definitely research a little bit more but I'm gonna share with you my opinion about the film and my thoughts actually went in with a little bit of a smaller expectation,0.10697921
I tried to go in with 0 because it's it was a little bit risky,0.15346225
I it looked really good right the trailer,0.09005779
I think undeniably looked decent it definitely isn't really what the movies about,0.06568879
I'll tell you that but because get out created by Jordan Peele of course was so well received in the horror community,0.15091205
although some would argue it's not a true horror film and you know there are a lot of people that didn't actually like get out,0.15218665
but I think in general it was well-received,0.057036288
so I didn't want to hype up this movie too much because although I was excited I was worried it wasn't going to live up to the hype because we've only ever seen get out from Jordan peels,0.097242564
so we were like is,0.047998406
he a one-hit wonder is he gonna be able to like make a name for himself as a horror creator,0.2542414
so short answer does us live up to its hype and live up to get out,0.094704755
and the Jordan Peele name absolutely,0.053414557
now after I saw the trailer of course I was excited but I was worried because it looked kind of like I was worried it was gonna be what you see is what you get and it was gonna be kind of a basic home invasion film with a twist,0.12219407
the fact that they were like twins or like they looked just like them,0.1073557
it's us,0.05497703
you know,0.07163658
there's also nervous going in because the trailer portrays it kind of like a home invasion film,0.083911605
and that's actually one of my least favorite horror genres,0.14175503
they're just not that terrifying to me with a few exceptions such as hush really loved hush but generally they're not my favorite kind of movies because I just don't they're kind of boring to me is that weird to say and without giving anything away or giving away spoilers just yet I do want to say that this isn't really a home,0.18277772
invasion film I would not consider a home invasion movie so don't go into it,0.1327986
expecting a home invasion movie of course because it is a Jordan Peele movie and he has just you know declared that his running theme within his movies and his work will be social commentary what is the social comp well I'll get into the specific of what the social commentary isn't spoilers because I don't want to ruin it,0.1347352
if you haven't seen it yet,0.079564355
but of course there is social commentary in this film and I do think that this movie did a much better job than get out in being a standalone true horror film I feel like anyone can go into this and enjoy it simply as a movie and as a horror movie versus get out where it was kind of like more in-your-face social commentary is very much more literal although there was smaller pieces of symbolism throughout,0.1095212
it of course this movie can definitely stand on its own without having the viewer have to think too hard about the social commentary while you're watching it of course,0.08081181
I was doing that,0.050201844
so I'm trying to put together the pieces and figure out what he's talking about,0.080802605
but you can enjoy this film,0.11525657
without having to think too much about it because it's not right in your face fully,0.5154597
it's just a really good horror movie in itself and then you have the underlying social commentary aspect along with it,0.13006675
so in my opinion,0.08078078
I feel like that was a really successful portrayal of what he was trying to say this scares in the movie I think were so effective,0.068850905
and my job was just on the floor,0.07056452
sometimes like I I wasn't truly terrified like I wasn't shaking in my chair or anything,0.14966953
I tend to not do that anyway with most horror movies I feel like I'm a little bit more desensitized but it was truly terrifying like there were moments that were horrific and scary at least to me as far as criticism obviously I've been hyping it up a lot,0.11666449
and I do have criticism of this film obviously if you look too deep into things and specifics,0.12919469
a lot of the underlying symbolisms and things that he's trying to reach for sometimes they don't make sense,0.05727223
and they wouldn't be realistic in the real world granted,0.08116083
it's not it's a movie so I feel like we can kind of forgive some of the smaller inconsistencies or imperfections within the movie because after all it is about the symbolism while still maintaining the atmosphere of a horror movie so you have to be able to kind of look past those smaller things that just don't make sense or don't really add up,0.09466447
I think it's a given for me to say that the acting was OnPoint like amazing the visuals were great only had really one or two issues with it and those I'll get into more in the spoiler section although I don't really consider them too spoilery,0.15272196
but there's two scenes that I feel like we could have just deleted and it would have been better,0.067333646
another thing,0.058267165
I want to say is that Jordan Peele has like a really good eye for detail and literally everything in the film paid off in the end like everything,0.06876022
you know had significance later on any time we saw something happen or an item or something it had meaning later on in the film and that's so satisfying as a viewer to have that kind of payoff for everything that we're taking in it all comes back together,0.07716282
I felt that the explanation for the whole movie and the plot and everything is just enough,0.050798796
I feel like it might have been a little spoon fed to the viewer and I usually hate that but in the moment it didn't feel like it,0.14881814
but maybe it's explained in a way that some people would find a little spoon fed because the viewer vent is not left to come to their own conclusions about the film and about the symbolism and commentary and everything like that,0.05190851
but I think had we not had the type of explanation that we did there's a certain scene where things are like rounded out,0.06456515
and like explained more in depth,0.05520678
if we hadn't had that I feel like there would be than those people that are like,0.11348121
what is going,0.06754984
what is the reason for this,0.06644825
why is that happening okay,0.079468265
so with that general review obviously I really enjoyed the film I really loved it,0.056197073
and I'm actually going to go see it again,0.07371583
on my anniversary on Tuesday,0.11417221
my boyfriend are gonna go watch it again,0.1081168
because we want to go in with knowing the whole film watching it from the beginning again,0.024451094
so I do recommend it,0.06417756
I think it's amazing,0.06751834
I'm gonna get into spoilers now and pretty much,0.13806035
the rest of the movie like the whole movie the entire movie - and talk about my favorite pieces of commentary and symbolism and little Easter eggs and things that I liked about it obviously like I said it's not gonna be all of,0.15745956
it I'm not gonna unpack all of that,0.110659994
stuff so yeah spoilers ahead talking about the whole rest of the movie the ending the twist everything like,0.076793976
that so you haven't seen,0.11224909
it yet I do not recommend continuing continuing to watch this video because it'll ruin it for you just go watch it just go see,0.29810658
it you need to see it in theatres and experience,0.07774588
it,0.046851434
so the first thing I'm going to talk about is actually the social commentary part of the film I think by now the social commentary aspect at the film is pretty obvious,0.044908784
there are a bunch of other theories floating around my boyfriend and I figured it out on the drive home and like piece together all the things that reinforce the theory basically it's about the class system in America the issue of homelessness,0.15517464
the lower class middle class and upper class are all represented within the movie we have the lower class of the untethered Underground,0.101201594
we have the middle class of the Wilsons the main family and then we have the upper class which is represented by the Tyler family who seems to always have like similar things to the middle class but like better you know also the title the movie us could quite literally mean us,0.053611897
also the charity that has talked about a lot in the film Hands Across America is you know commentary on the charities and things that are ineffective in the United States that are there for homelessness but Hands Across America was actually a real charity that was attempted and failed pretty much a lot of the donations and things didn't end up going to the homeless because they had a lot of overhead costs and stuff so it ended up not being beneficial to the lower class or homelessness in America I really loved that social commentary that's something that's definitely important and a huge issue,0.0886826
but I'm really happy he went,0.055115696
this route with dealing with the lower-class and representing them in the movie and using certain symbolism to show that they were lower-class apparently the lower-class don't have eyebrows so but you know their appearance is a whole part of them being the lower class in that thing look kind of more sickly because the lower-class in America doesn't have the best access to health care,0.329582
let's go ahead and talk about the big twist the reveal in the end that red is actually the real Adelaide when she wandered off as a little girl at the fair and she ran into her untethered down below was strangled,0.3155355
the untethered actually switched places with her,0.120967746
and now they lived above ground and forced the real Adelaide to live underground with the untether to me this is horrifying in,0.24638973
so many ways like I just could not stop thinking about the fact that this real human child grew up for like what 20 30 years underground,0.121984944
I don't know how old she is but she has two kids grew up in this underground area that's totally uncomfortable,0.24194975
they ate raw rabbits,0.18384083
they had to mimic the people that they were tethered to on the ground,0.23304768
I don't know above that for that long though she I mean that's like a new kind of torture,0.43686417
am i right,0.059329823
and then when you learn that and you think back to when she is like talking to who we think is the real Adelaide and her voice which will get into her voice,0.26142502
because I don't know why they're serious about it,0.086838245
it's obvious but we'll get into the voice but she's like talking to her saying like well you got food I had a raw rabbits and you got toys and I had to play with sharp shiny things and it's just,0.14888142
so in hindsight that twist to me seems so obvious anyone else,0.10688082
I don't know if anyone caught it,0.112144925
I didn't catch it at all,0.060172927
I don't know why because looking back it's like oh obviously that happened like that of course that would be a plot point in this story but I didn't catch it,0.052077033
so was it successful you tell me did you catch it before,0.1010814
they revealed it Jordan Peele embedded,0.07839865
so many things into the movie that was supposed to lead us to this revelation,0.08524313
you know she only drinks water she's eating strawberries while her family is eating chicken her friend offers her a rose a and she's like I'm good with water,0.24021247
she only drinks water Pepe,0.18970397
what do you do,0.066569224
and there's these little moments that you back and realize that Jordan Peele was telling this to us,0.0944023
all,0.036047194
along there's theories out there that people believe that Jason which is the boy is also had also switched with his tethered and he and they have like evidence behind it I just don't believe that theory if it is true it's definitely not as obvious as red and Adelaide is I think it's been confirmed or anything,0.09937619
but I just I don't believe that theory personally,0.07807114
so the next thing I want to talk about is her voice,0.087879874
and I wasn't really gonna get into this other than mentioning it was fantastic,0.1693334
and as soon as she started talking I got goose bumps like I got chills because I was scared like I could not imagine that in real life,0.11025908
and I saw some discussion actually on Twitter of what causes her to talk like this which I thought was obvious but some believe that they're not used to breathing the air above ground,0.14921251
but if that was the case then other people could talk there's a reason,0.07200786
why only red can talk,0.09320575
and then some other people said that her voice is like that because she was strangled as a child realistically the real tethered,0.5522488
people don't have a voice which is a symbol of the lower-class not having a voice in America,0.19068635
and that's you know done on purpose,0.09006681
there's a reason why she can talk it's because she's actually a real human that was switched with her tethered long ago and she has not been able to use her boys or hasn't you know no one else she's surrounded by uses their voice,0.26176482
so she's not communicating like you would in the real world also there's the fact that Lupita and the yong-go mimicked her voice to create this like scary voice,0.37294382
she mimicked dysphonia which is a brain disorder,0.74491113
that causes speech to become like that which tells me it's more accurate that she had just not used her voice for so long instead of being strangled because I feel like if it was about her being strangled,0.40330482
she wouldn't have mimicked a brain disorder,0.6241282
okay now that I've raved about this movie for so long and talked to old about about the theories can I talk today did you hear that I'm gonna get into a couple things that I didn't like about the movie which isn't a lot,0.0866377
but I did find some things that I just didn't like about it,0.057598766
so to start the very first frame of the and the very last frame of the movie I could have done completely without,0.05912226
the first frame is actually text explaining that there are miles of unused tunnels across America,0.06984603
and now I feel like this is added to explain to the viewer that this is happening all over America,0.075262465
and so we understand it not just California and Santa Cruz it is all over the United States what if you figure out the deeper meaning of the social commentary aspect of this movie though you understand that it's about all of America,0.09902355
it's not just California,0.05210686
I think that's obvious,0.056109473
please don't he's being so rambunctious right,0.4314023
now when I'm trying to film a video to me,0.068060294
it's just obvious that it's nationwide,0.09243585
because homelessness is an issue nationwide,0.19079804
so of course we don't need the tunnel common you know comment to tell us though it's all over America,0.11542153
I don't know why else that thing would be there,0.11118177
it was definitely very confusing that it started off that way cuz,0.058794275
I was like what do you,0.08339701
what because then I was anticipating tunnels did it come out and I'm like okay,0.12901704
so it's not a home invasion like I knew that right off of that because they put this text screen on there,0.081750765
and then on top of that when she goes to the mirror the house of mirrors situation towards the end you realize oh the tunnels,0.13639991
so I wasn't surprised when she started going down on an escalator where I feel like that scene would have been so much more powerful and terrifying had I not known it was about tunnels at all,0.1141564
so the very last scene of the film is actually a wide shot showing the tethered people holding hands,0.08800457
there's like a string of people along the mountains,0.16859974
and then he sees some helicopters,0.15290062
it was really the helicopters that I didn't like being there because I feel like it would have been much more of a jarring image if it was just the tethered because then you don't really know the severity of the situation but given that there are still people alive in the helicopters and obviously like are trying to figure out situation to me it kind of takes away the eeriness and the unsettling ness of the tether taking over because there are still people alive which of course there are it's still early on,0.06466862
it's not like all of America's dead now,0.56204736
and they're the last living family,0.12987775
but I still wish we didn't see the helicopters or even just,0.066395216
the last scene although I really liked the image of them going for like miles that looked like,0.085303456
also I really liked the fact that they killed their tethered by stabbing them with a pair of scissors and the throat hence taking away their voice kind of in the voice box too you know because they don't have a voice delete the scissors themselves our symbol because it's two parts two halves,0.5627439
that are symmetrical,0.054180797
there's just so much,0.05477182
there's so many details little fine things like that that you can google and look up all of them,0.099254966
the ultimate question is is this better than get out,0.10113109
now I hate asking that because we don't need to compare them,0.36199254
they are two individual separate films but we're gonna compare it like you have to compare them,0.12523393
it's his only two movies,0.080461286
so of course you want to know if he's getting better or if he's getting worse,0.21470311
so I'd love to hear what your thoughts are about if it's better then get out my thoughts,0.17927787
yes,0.036876976
I think it is better because it can stand alone as a horror movie and I do believe that us is more of a true horror movie and get out as kind of more alert,0.21684536
I would argue that it's better than get out and it definitely shows that Jordan Peele is no one-hit wonder,0.14941068
I am so excited that he is coming into the horror community when he is and doing these social commentary horror movies because I think it's something it's like a whole new genre,0.25004384
and I think it's something the horror community really needed because right,0.13796476
now all we seem to be focused on our remakes sequels and like making movies out of things that are already done or like books,0.08818374
you know like stories that aren't original there aren't a lot of original horror movies coming out lately there's a handful of course you could argue that there's a handful here and there but we are in the era of remakes,0.09007535
so to see these original ideas come forth and be done really,0.05958395
well I think is so exciting and I can't wait for Twilight Zone and to see what he does with that,0.07792975
so of course I want this to be more of a conversation between you and I and you and all of you together,0.18584932
I want to hear your thoughts,0.1194885
I know some people didn't like this film which is hard to believe for me because I loved the movie so much - the issues I had that that goes with any,0.103107415
movie so I want to hear your,0.1497164
thoughts if you didn't like it especially I want to know what was it about it that you just didn't,0.11018804
like so leave all that down,0.18106022
below I hope you,0.15040521
enjoyed,0.04294416
and I will talk to you soon bye you,0.19733623
