hello everyone is your boy terrance here with hollywood already did it and i just,0.09245853
came back from the theaters from seeing a new coming-of-age comedy from first time director,0.03346539
Olivia Wilde and book-smart now the guys know this is one of my hidden gems,0.20269409
up for may 2019 so I'm excited to talk to you guys by let you,0.039235193
know what I thought about it so we'll get into it right after the jump,0.036592416
so for those of you who don't know book-smart is a film from Olivia Wilde,0.17659229
about two teenage girls played by Kaitlyn Dever best recognized from justified and beanie Feldstein,0.03799795
who in addition to being Jonah Hill younger sister she was also in Lady Bird,0.036196634
she's got a great career she's on tour on Broadway with Bette Miller now or,0.030313749
she wasn't 2017 so she's got a great career as well but it's about two,0.043163765
teenage girls who have been doing their entire high school life by the books their,0.16159706
straight-a students that get into the best colleges they've been doing everything on the straight,0.05937429
and narrow they had no fun no party they kind of just been living just,0.13361278
the two of them in their bubble while everybody else is out possibly succeeding but,0.029353889
having fun and they want to have at least one time or one night of,0.04810076
fun before they go off into college so that's what the prior premise of the,0.029925281
film is about and and I think they they succeed to make a pretty pretty,0.045882374
solid coming-of-age story that I think a lot of people should be seeing and it,0.06259844
should be doing better in theaters in it currently is so we don't know what,0.04485533
are doing the reviews here we talk about likes first then dislikes them they will,0.099703714
rent it okay so let's start off with my likes what I really like about,0.101563565
this movie I'm off top is that it it's sort of a smorgasbord of coming-of-age,0.11111427
stories I the biggest one that you can think of is because the two leads,0.041267328
and how it's kind of structured is super bad that's what comes to mind but,0.053043738
I would say super bad meets a little bit of Lady Bird with sprinkle in,0.17866832
some of last year's blockers I think all of those kind of come together and,0.02280183
create a good a new way of seeing a coming-of-age story from the eyes of,0.03934295
young women and I think what really helps the story and why it feels so,0.050632447
much more authentic is that it's starring women written by women and then directed by,0.12916403
a woman who you can do that and it creates a masterful add I think,0.12310687
masterful story that they've put together that even when sometimes which will get into dislikes,0.060994014
even sometimes when it gets becomes a little what you could see predictable you can,0.031000884
you can kind of pull out threads it's done in such a way and done,0.09872523
in such a refreshing way that because we're getting this story through someone else's eyes,0.031780478
it's just as new as it would be having seen American Pie all the decades,0.053526662
ago that I did to the direction of the film is really strong for a,0.013717417
living wild to be this her first time I think she did a really good,0.1053305
job I don't know films are shot out of order so I don't know if,0.051257722
she shot the first half of the film first and then the back half but,0.096580006
I feel like you can I feel like the eye of the director improved as,0.017361958
the film went along because it comes in a little less by the books and,0.025870988
it becomes a little bit more artsy toward the back half uh and I don't,0.083127335
know if that was a choice or if she she wanted to structure the film,0.032864064
like that but I think when we get to the final party in this movie,0.03313812
there's some great things done directing wise that I just fell in love with there's,0.031020174
an entire I'm not going into spoilers but there's an entire pool sequence that happens,0.02548385
that a reveal happens for our main character and you get to see visually underwater,0.016479924
all the reactions that Amy kaitland goes through to for the audience to kind of,0.01752759
a ride go up and down she's on cloud nine then a reveal happens and,0.028370082
she's not and you get to see all of that emotion you could just see,0.060420625
that come back and there's a great argument seeing sequence between Amy and Molly that,0.015620507
happens and you get to drop out the sound but you just make out the,0.039036967
face facial mouthing and reactions that they're giving each other and small simple choices but,0.1773486
it's so powerful and it works and it gives the moments that this movie could,0.01977857
just be like blockers which I liked to where it's straight comedy with some emotional,0.09881104
beads these emotional beats hit a little bit harder because there's a lot more weight,0.24318837
and gravitas to it I think it's handled really well three I really dug the,0.04827504
message of this film I know a lot of a lot of coming-of-age stories do,0.034078024
the thing where there's a smart person there's a dumb person there's a jock there's,0.371486
the the promiscuous gorilla might have used the word but there's a promiscuous girl and,0.40311757
you can have all of it they're all separate people what this movie does well,0.06006342
and gives a message about and what I think is the actual tableau of what,0.026763
high schools always had been is that people can be all of those things at,0.01423493
once and so there's a huge sequence that happens in earlier in the film where,0.026508233
our character Molly goes through a situation where she realizes that what she thought was,0.013173297
necessary to get to school everyone took it to a good college everyone else's has,0.033197984
gotten to a good college as well while also still living their life and you,0.120653674
can still be the jock the sports guy you can maybe not even go to,0.041995704
school but get a great job a six-figure income job you could be what would,0.029528167
be considered the the high school and you still have a good solid school in,0.040621433
front in front of you and then I think what happens and what I really,0.053943068
love about the movie it that it tail ends and comes back to show you,0.1100819
that while you make while you may have your view of this one person and,0.082581885
you may have this one view of this one person as being the jock whatever,0.051521134
it is they are also the other side human and they've been struggling with the,0.055476315
labeling that people that put on them and maybe that's not necessarily the case and,0.03701148
maybe that's not and maybe it is the case but even if that is they,0.019493872
were just living their life they were being a kid they were doing what kids,0.14821821
do let them live their life they're still going to go off and do great,0.16337243
things as they grow up and I love that this movie kind of shows you,0.063018836
both sides and gives you the full coin of what it's like to be in,0.04062742
high school now let's talk about the dislikes this one's hard for me to do,0.10074606
this likes cuz that I feel like I'm pulling at straws to do this and,0.23145202
it shows you how I how much I do really really enjoy this movie so,0.07357995
my dislikes are me pulling whether sometimes no necessary there's no need to do so,0.120639704
one there is a secondary character in this movie that borders on the line of,0.04553714
being hyper-realistic or a caricature I love what she's doing everything she's doing is great,0.15616517
but it happened so much and so randomly that it it almost feels like we,0.016311632
are this characters like the roadrunner and just keeps popping up and showing up in,0.042171977
places where everything else seems super realistic and she seems to be the outlier of,0.030992901
that now it fixes itself a little bit this is where I I it's hard,0.09679952
for me to put this in a hundred percent dislike because it didn't really bother,0.033138786
me and the reason why it didn't bother me because there is a mentioning of,0.026560118
why of how she is or who she really is by a secondary care by,0.052532215
another character that's attached to her that kind of cleans up her her story and,0.03241041
gives her a purpose which helped me kind of click in my head like okay,0.2440429
I can then justify the wackiness and Jane it is so who that character is,0.029391805
to the the relationships that our main character Amy and Molly sort of wind up,0.022930875
to is very heavily Telegraph at the beginning of the film and for some that,0.016237132
could be a problem because you can kind of like oh well I knew this,0.064399086
was happening I saw this the read the writing was on the wall I'm always,0.025310237
for this one I'm undermining my dislikes but the reason why that didn't concern me,0.04604135
so much as yes it is very telegraphed and I could see if even the,0.024100268
moment to happen as though that's where we're going with these people the reason why,0.04160391
I've been bothered me so much is because it's unlike a lot of films that,0.06870948
do it then Telegraph it this feels earned when they get to that pay off,0.03372614
or when they get to those newfound relationships because they all have to have a,0.023041297
moment and what they are chasing that does not work or does not fail or,0.020022692
something happens that they have to Dinn kind of readjusting and flip on the fly,0.09255499
and say well yeah that's what I wanted but this might be what's better and,0.028570969
I think that's a fact of life that needs to be taught and so that,0.040304806
while it is Telegraph I feel like the process to get there is very realistic,0.023567457
and very true and very earned so it it doesn't matter that it's on the,0.015937135
wall like I think the directing in the way that is written and done is,0.01035957
so packaged together perfectly at weather you know that that's where they end up is,0.020897409
irrelevant I think it's the journey to get there is what's important and then the,0.015506761
third thing that that kind of is a disliking again not really um the third,0.07055803
dislike would be it's a predictable story but all coming-of-age stories are predictable I mean,0.03905892
that's sort of what they are you know that they're going to learn they're going,0.03762944
to go start off one way they're gonna learn something important and they're going to,0.036726784
be a slightly different person than they were at the end of it that's what,0.038932532
coming-of-age stories are so none of that really bothers me yes there's a predictability to,0.027925074
it but again with one of my likes when I talked about the fact that,0.021341752
we're getting this from a woman from a woman starring women written by women to,0.20410095
showcase that women go through the same things that that guys do or sometimes leaving,0.15804364
it's even harder for them I think that supersedes the predictability aspect of it makes,0.023393843
just a film that I think personally I think anybody should see this and I,0.05737608
it's funny as I was leaving the theater I was thinking like why didn't this,0.046452433
connect with anybody like why is this movie not working in the theaters and the,0.03454897
only thing that I can think of and it sucks because I feel like this,0.34835246
is a common thing for all all audiences I feel like general audiences don't want,0.015727602
to see girls because this happen with blockers too don't want to see girls or,0.13880187
women go through drugs foul language or sexual acts from adolescents to kid adolescents to,0.5817179
adults the way that they're okay with seeing it for guys I could be wrong,0.06936003
go ahead leave your comments in the comment section let me know if I may,0.028517753
be off base but I feel like that sometimes is why movies like blockers or,0.029105775
or this when they do coming-of-age stories for women they're not as well received by,0.1703196
as they would be by the audience's of eyes they would be if I super,0.028455226
bad or like can hardly wait or American Pie it feels like the our American,0.11427323
culture is programmed to say boys will be boys but girls can't do that and,0.21035236
I feel like we need to get away from that as fast as we possibly,0.0810054
can and just show that like we're all we've all are willing and able to,0.01333028
f up and not know what the hell we're doing and we have to go,0.33853602
through these things this movie has a great sequence at the end with Molly and,0.045342244
a girl that she did not like that just made my heart melt because it's,0.20592755
like oh yeah of course a girl going to figuring out herself sexually doesn't mean,0.2715655
that that's whatever stamp or whatever name that they give her is who she is,0.05938826
as a whole she's more than that but I feel like our the way that,0.0290652
America works and the way the guys work is that they won't allow her that,0.06400862
process and in high school but there's a whole moment with her and I won't,0.025878305
give away the speech but it's great so what did I think about the film,0.046097893
where does it rank on my thing as you can tell even my dislikes aren't,0.07277974
that harsh for this film because I think this is this is one of my,0.07274648
favorite movies of the year so far so obviously just in saying that when we,0.011869537
rank them what do I rank them is it play it again Sam once is,0.022312256
enough or give me a time stone or like erase my brain for this one,0.3049414
it's it's cut and dry it's very easy play this one again Sam play it,0.026781624
again play it again play it again I really really enjoyed this movie out of,0.040497046
all the hidden gems that I've said for the May of 2019 this is the,0.015810085
one that ranks the highest on that list for me I think everybody should be,0.057842374
seeing this film and I hope I hope that the box office doesn't discourage both,0.046677932
Olivia Wilde as a director cuz I think she does a great job but I,0.09881902
hope this also doesn't discourage or other women and women writers and from getting the,0.04834488
stories for from the female perspective out there because I think they're just as necessary,0.08982973
and I think this might be the one that has to kind of like you,0.053367686
might have to take a couple of bullets that say you know we got to,0.29466048
show you that we can do the same thing or show you that girls got,0.10680921
the same thing as guys girls are still trying to figure out their selves like,0.12282749
guys are before one of these breaks through and you're like okay fine yes we,0.03935958
are all accepting we'll take all of this um I don't it doesn't it doesn't,0.020716479
look like Walker's did that doesn't look like this do that hopefully something comes along,0.022748616
it and these will be just kind of the pebble stones to get up to,0.08075462
that point where we get a film that everyone's like okay they yawa um that's,0.05339895
it you haven't checked it out you should go to the theaters and check it,0.023214243
out it's probably gonna have a limited run at playing at the independent the it's,0.02729049
probably my AMC Theaters but it's playing on the independent circuit of it so I,0.02050096
don't know how long it's going to be there I feel like once the next,0.04422141
big release comes out its gonna get pushed so if you have it in your,0.10932692
theaters go check it out okay those are my thoughts on books mark what did,0.0882865

go check it out but if you have let me know about your comments what,0.048573706
