hey everybody today I'm reviewing spotlight which is directed by thomas mccarthy this is his,0.04401853
fifth film i believe this film has an incredibly talented cast that has enough sophistication,0.050516706
to be able to act in a very understated manner nobody here is really being,0.036289092
showy with their acting which to me really matches the very minimalistic and understated style,0.10397486
of the film you have Michael Keaton Mark Ruffalo Rachel McAdams Liev Schreiber stanley tucci,0.0741866
and the list goes on and this film is based on true events that happened,0.014052005
in Boston in the early 2000s 2001 actually and basically it's about the investigative journalism,0.018581904
unit in the Boston Globe and they come across a story about allegations made against,0.008515016
the Catholic Church and a few priests in the area were accused of molesting 80,0.16226223
or more boys throughout the years and of course nowadays it's more common knowledge but,0.022980765
at the time it was considered quite shocking it was scandalous especially because Americans didn't,0.054407366
know how to deal with this kind of information because you know the church is,0.03661836
deeply embedded in the ideologies of American culture and it's hugely fundamental in terms of,0.04354625
how the country was built in the first place just like many of the corporations,0.04102986
that have been built over the decades over the centuries religion and and the church,0.07122986
has become a dominant conglomerate in its own right that's the dilemma of the film,0.035704397
and it's not only just an overall dilemma but it's also a lot of internal,0.026212227
conflict with the actual characters the main characters themselves because many of them were raised,0.06312194
Catholic as children it's about lifting that veil so to speak on this puritanical society,0.117694266
whatever that means and something that people thought that they knew and that they trusted,0.06575407
and revealing this dark underbelly of society that you know so many terrible things are,0.14741799
happening that people do not acknowledge I loved this movie I thought it was a,0.08546811
wonderful piece of filmmaking it works on so many different levels it works as a,0.054521114
great investigative piece it works as a social commentary and it's also a very grippy,0.020253511
suspenseful piece of filmmaking and it never over does a single aspect of what it's,0.13601276
trying to convey this film is extremely reminiscent of a lot of those very minimalistic,0.048870377
raw 1970s films like All the President's Men that's the easiest comparison i can make,0.08840956
because they both are very very similar and then of course i felt like as,0.03515961
i was watching this movie I was watching this great Sidney Lumet films like Dog,0.13009197
Day Afternoon Serpico spotlight works right along with those films almost perfectly because there's almost,0.09024946
no fat to trim here I mean they get right down to it it's very,0.076237366
direct there's nothing at all that is superfluous and it's not a glamorous Hollywood movie,0.030071622
in the slightest everything feels very very real the office settings are very bland and,0.052622013
ordinary and the wardrobes of the characters feel just very mundane and they don't draw,0.021653058
attention to themselves not in a boring way but they're just trying to capture the,0.03162283
details every little thing that makes you feel like you are living in this world,0.07109084
every single tints in immediate moment that these journalists are feeling you feel like you're,0.053306486
right along with them in this movie really celebrates professionalism and it celebrates what investigative,0.046538245
journalism can be so you don't see much about what's going on in the characters,0.039943613
lives other than what's in their professional lives but the film always just gives very,0.031340126
subtle hints of what's going on in these characters personal lives so that you are,0.0479318
able to build enough sympathy as a viewer and they are never overt about it,0.05998626
it's always just kind of a little thing here or there you know in a,0.019441988
lesser film probably a lot of the characters would have you know pause the rest,0.054178543
of the film and gone into this very wordy anecdote and that just would have,0.03137871
really detracted I think as these characters are discovering all of these really troubling facts,0.02071914
about all these priests and as the facts start to build and build and they,0.08303687
find more and more information you just get sucked into it right along with them,0.60785896
one thing that really makes the movie work is that it really does pay attention,0.012503457
to the time period it takes that time period of 2001 and makes it a,0.01914199
major focal point which is something that raises the stakes 2001 was a major turning,0.013092144
point not just for Americans but for the entire world I mean it was the,0.059532605
start of a new millennium and of course 911 happens right in the middle of,0.04494513
when these journalists are trying to gather all this information on the church and priorities,0.045628272
start to shift very in a very different direction and the world becomes a lot,0.07639102
darker and a lot more cynical as a result also we start to see the,0.13830698
internet becoming a lot more prominent a lot more relevant as the 2000 start to,0.022019574
progress so the old world of the newspaper and journalism is starting to die out,0.2656628
and these characters at the Boston Globe they're not only trying to expose a very,0.010326311
dark scandal but they're also trying to save themselves and try to gather those readers,0.053817347
that they might be losing so that they can continue doing important journalism a lot,0.037576225
of the characters you can see as they're trying to find out more information on,0.016978813
this story they are constantly going through you know physical archives books and and pages,0.039805256
and pages of information and there's very little digital work going on in terms of,0.012794808
the internet and not only does that show you how much times have changed since,0.025475869
then but I think that's very deliberate on the part of the director because you're,0.041810784
seeing all of these characters teetering right on the edge of the old world and,0.04896417
this breakthrough into the digital world and now we live in a time where nothing,0.06290775
is secretive almost anything you can find just by the click of a button it's,0.035758942
easier to find stories and to discuss them and to expose the system for what,0.011818983
it truly is these journalists are right on the cusp of that and it's almost,0.037659373
as if they're introducing symbolically the world in in the story at least to a,0.02245527
different world we're digging for stories and having to go do all this underground work,0.0229648
is going to start becoming far more mainstream that's just one reason why I think,0.035624575
that they'll have so many great ideas going on and they're pulled off in the,0.05232534
most effort list of ways and the drama comes from underneath which is very rare,0.023711136
in a Hollywood film there are a few things here and there that I would,0.03857666
change just to give the film more polish more sophistication one big thing for me,0.03134279
was the score by Howard sure I just I felt like it came off as,0.047828034
very kind of cookie cutter detective music I thought that the film deserved a lot,0.094873145
more I wish they were able to get somebody like David Shire you should look,0.05028123
up his music for another 1970s film that this film reminds me of the conversation,0.029512202
he did that score and he also did zodiac that would have been the perfect,0.03843431
way to enhance it for me but I mean I'm nitpicking what's more important is,0.020165043
the power that this film has just a story and as something that is a,0.021646407
social commentary it's very relevant and it needs to be told and you should absolutely,0.017662622
see it it is very entertaining it is well made it's it's a really really,0.034634117
