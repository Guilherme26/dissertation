a quiet place is directed by John Krasinski and stars him and his real-life wife,0.08185085
Emily Blunt as a married couple living on their farm trying to keep their family,0.041158237
safe in a world that has now been overtaken by alien creature things and safety,0.15752082
is not guaranteed because that these creatures are all though blind they are incredibly fast,0.064663164
and violent and our hypersensitive to noise basically if you make even the slightest amount,0.23449028
of noise outside of the general nature eco noises that exist day to day these,0.051432665
creatures are going to hear you they're gonna find you and they're going to tear,0.1483925
you apart [Applause] you guys this entire movie I had my popcorn held up to,0.19686376
my face like this and that's for two reasons one for some reason whenever I,0.06916247
watch horror movies thrillers anything where there's tension and anxiety I find it a lot,0.13647173
easier to watch if half of my face is obscured I don't know why I've,0.13450146
always kind of had this thing really and horror movies I'll often watch through fingers,0.0951033
like this but the second reason my popcorn stayed firmly in front of my face,0.12198537
was because you cannot eat popcorn in this movie it's too noisy so the theater,0.055603366
that I watched this movie in was quite small it was about 30 seats maybe,0.026233513
and about half of the people that are watching this movie had popcorn for the,0.043502346
first 20 minutes of the movie it's practically quiet so everyone was kind of sitting,0.062143452
there had their popcorn out Carlita too noisy would wait until there was maybe like,0.10860254
some dialogue or some music and then it was like either the popcorn drink all,0.02484594
the drinks and it would go quiet again and then you put your popcorn down,0.05798938
and I think the reason that this is a testament to how well sound or,0.01805641
lack of sound is utilizing this film is that if you're an audience member and,0.035560053
you feel panic about making noise because the characters on the screen feel panicked about,0.030560533
making noise then that just shows how transported you are into this film so the,0.04646441
film centers around this family about just under a year and a half after these,0.034457177
creatures have invaded I guess and they are still living on their family farm they,0.032620605
communicate mostly via sign language and they've established these safeguards all these signals for emergencies,0.07686064
so they've kind of established some sort of day-to-day way of dealing with these creatures,0.06157339
also the mother Evelyn is pretty heavily pregnant which we'll talk about a little bit,0.08687963
later as well so one of the best parts about this movie is seeing what,0.028681388
steps the parents have taken to create a kind of normal life for their children,0.06129335
and what is obviously a very abnormal situation the children or games but instead of,0.061825495
the little plastic pieces they now play with pieces of fabric or pom-pom type things,0.08693817
they have homework they have family dinners around the dinner table they have created this,0.017101206
kind of normal world for their children and it's the little attention to detail in,0.049832232
these scenes that really brings to life this family and their struggle in this universe,0.072308786
I really love the casting in this film John Emily have amazing chemistry what you'd,0.041478857
expect because they are married in real life but the children in this film are,0.06776957
phenomenal in particular the deaf daughter and the movie Regan is played by an actress,0.09613633
called Millicent Simmons who is deaf in real life and she was absolutely outstanding in,0.05206858
this I've watched interviews with John Krasinski where he said that he insisted that a,0.026689164
deaf actress was cast to play the role of Regan one because he didn't want,0.08224397
somebody pretending to be deaf but two because he really wanted to get a true,0.0733937
sense of what it would be like to be deaf in this world that he,0.18083815
had creatives and I think that really paid off because it does feel very genuine,0.031099996
and the movie another thing that's really interesting which comes from this deaf character is,0.033819266
the difference between quiet and the film end true silence whenever Reagan's on the screen,0.039976873
always see the movie from her point of view they've removed all sound from the,0.04265956
screen so it's completely silent and to me this added an extra layer of tension,0.047486797
because for somebody who was deaf living in a world where noise is so important,0.0781491
it would be so much harder not knowing ie whether you've created noise so if,0.044983707
you accidentally stand on something or not something over you wouldn't even hear that or,0.07996372
likewise if you were near something that was creating noise and you wouldn't be able,0.03702545
to hear it and there's a scene in the movie that really captures that where,0.018362395
there is one of the creatures behind her heavily breathing but she obviously hasn't noticed,0.11084221
it because she can't hear that so let's talk about emily Blunt's character evelyn being,0.030933036
pregnant for a moment i had no problem with the fact that she was pregnant,0.072951354
of anything actually it does provide one of the most tense scenes in the entire,0.036120802
movie my gripe with it was the fact that the film is set for the,0.02955677
most part on day or around day 460 something I think which is about a,0.022426002
year and a half and to these creatures invading and Evelyn's maybe seven months pregnant,0.12397826
which means that she got pregnant after the creatures invaded we see so much of,0.10430745
them putting in these safeguards for their children and really trying to protect themselves in,0.105466865
the future of their kids it didn't feel like a decision that the characters would,0.019716043
have made to me I don't think they would have consciously made the decision to,0.030533925
have a child maybe it wasn't a conscious decision but it feels like it would,0.052161705
would have been some ways of him to avoid that happening I would have preferred,0.045152
that rather than it being de 460 whatever it was say de 180 which means,0.04451808
that Evelyn could have been pregnant prior to this happening and not known about it,0.09513257
or something like that rather than it being a decision that potentially they made consciously,0.041334514
not a flaw with the film by any means just a personal preference for me,0.029302005
it would have made more sense to have it that way there are a couple,0.026085842
of decisions that I didn't like as well in this movie namely something that happens,0.026794927
with John Krasinski's character Lee towards the end of the film and also a revelation,0.004469369
that happens towards the end of the film again not flaws in my opinion just,0.03363102
things that I didn't quite like as much but overall this film I think was,0.037459817
absolutely fantastic it was scary it was tense every single second I cared about this,0.07905242
these characters in this family absolutely want to watch in the movie theatre because I,0.032851424
think the the way that sounds utilized is heightened when you're in that movie theater,0.029746348
situation but differently one to see I really enjoyed it quiet place I'm really excited,0.051334884
to see what John Krasinski does next as a director because I think he has,0.045869067
done a fantastic job with this one I'm giving a quiet place 8.5 out of,0.059504002
10 I'd love to know what you guys thought of this movie which you can,0.06951701
