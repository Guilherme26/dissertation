this is a movie that really makes me appreciate directors like Spike Lee people who,0.14830399
won't crumble on a devastating horrors that are happening under the current administration but who,0.08088314
are brave and also provocative enough to create something that pushes back this is black,0.31089434
lensman Knights of the Ku Klux Klan that's us sailes Fonda my name's Jimmy cage,0.20500506
and in his newest film filmmaker Spike Lee tells one hell of a true story,0.17526604
or as they put it this joint is based upon some for real for real,0.07465506
shi'ite black Landsman tells a story of Ron's Tara worth the first african-american police officer,0.44398603
and detective in a Colorado Springs Police Department who successfully infiltrated the local Ku Klux,0.12376306
Klan this sounds totally bonkers and I still remember that I thought this would be,0.4729892
a comedy when I first heard about the project some time ago and it does,0.06488098
indeed feature a lot of humor but at its heart it's a very frightening and,0.08697903
heavy crime drama the actual events that it's based on took place in 1979 but,0.06782452
a fool moved him back seven years to 1972 to incorporate the then trendy blaxploitation,0.76287645
movies as well as the re-election campaign of President Nixon which supposedly was supported by,0.041501082
the Klan and I think it's quite important to mention because I haven't seen a,0.10737418
movie in a long time that blurred the lines between art and real life as,0.15043458
much and as fascinating as this film does right from the beginning it confronts the,0.07742143
audience with images and sounds of DW Griffith's 1915 air Post The Birth of a,0.121101156
Nation and movie debt is held in high regards when it comes to its groundbreaking,0.09440718
influential new storytelling techniques but it's also one of the most notorious ones in film,0.08784128
history because of its racist overtones and the glorification of the Ku Klux Klan which,0.38238665
was a major reason for the real Klan to gain power again black Landsman begins,0.45111227
where the white supremacist using material to forward his agenda and is played by Alec,0.49776453
Baldwin right now Baldwin is probably the most prominent Donald Trump impersonator in the entertainment,0.15318614
industry and a connection to the current president is an association that's very easy to,0.1315471
make and is always political to a certain degree and from Spike Lee who made,0.10239951
such powerful films like do the right thing or Malcolm X I wouldn't expect any,0.15083057
less than a direct comment and of course criticism of Trump's presidency I don't want,0.18259685
to take away the ending of the film and I heard before that some people,0.1084019
think it's immensely powerful while other argue it's too much and not sorry I can,0.08850559
only speak for myself but I found it to be perfect and bald and incredibly,0.18204463
heart-wrenching but most importantly important and necessary maybe not absolutely necessary for the film but,0.05437221
necessary for our times right now and it goes without saying that a whole film,0.112414576
and the themes of race and bigotry couldn't be more timely and as applies not,0.26708415
just to the USA but a humanity on a global level the film comes back,0.10447205
to birth of a nation at a very crucial moment later on alongside a small,0.14913577
but important role played by the legendary Harry Belafonte who was an early supporter of,0.040922336
the civil rights movement the film also like ascent features some blaxploitation references like for,0.06986603
example the movie shaft it also makes several rather obvious allusions to Trump like for,0.1364728
example his whole make America great again stick the casting of John David washing and,0.12183983
lead alone is quite special too because he's the son of Denzel Washington with whom,0.1462942
Spike Lee worked for terms in the past most notably probably for Malcolm X it's,0.05401132
also very nice to see Topher Grace back in the 70s he portrays David Duke,0.06459839
who at the time was the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and yes,0.17487754
that's really the official term and it has also true that a real ronster birth,0.12423534
did indeed spoke with Luke over the phone who of course assumed that he was,0.044340983
talking to a white guy it's also fact that ster was infiltrated the Klan with,0.5171167
the help of a white surrogate in reality they were actually two people and to,0.24131778
the state there's not much known about them in the film it's a Jewish detective,0.43311793
Flip Zimmerman played by Adam driver by making him Jewish and of course playing a,0.061372723
lot with the clans hatred for Jews the film adds another layer we have one,0.5876557
person who is considered to be a lesser human being by the stupid races of,0.88942844
the Klan and they can easily recognize him because of his appearance alone and then,0.16423918
we have one person who is almost s hated by them but their twisted minds,0.6486869
have no chance to spot him just by looks there are many tense moments arising,0.10493232
from that and the film is short and directed in a way that's really seductive,0.0375848
for one Spike Lee really succeeds in creating a feeling for the 70s it was,0.04886018
shot on home on location and another key players the score by Terence Blanchard sometimes,0.15511252
haunting and brooding sometimes very cool and lean back I'm not a big expert on,0.09732364
Spike Lee but from what I've seen he often uses rather recognizable but also often,0.083385594
quite powerful techniques to emphasize certain aspects in an early sequence where we together with,0.027575899
one stare worth experience a speech by Stokely Carmichael aka Kwame ture Lee highlights certain,0.10311281
phases in the audience to show the effect on those people and probably also to,0.05788611
underline they're coming together and maybe the intimacy and empowering they felt in that moment,0.11334269
there are also a few instances where Lee shows a certain brief action for example,0.06540303
hanging up the phone from two different perspectives in quick succession over all black Landsman,0.33731017
is taught in a playful fashion and even though the narrative fits a bit and,0.08790481
even at times it never ever lost my interest which can be attributed to the,0.069453195
fascinating story the great performances and Lee's Direction not everything is coming together perfectly the,0.05599146
relationship to lower Harriers character Patrice Tomas who is the president of the Black Student,0.31406683
Union for example feels a bit under written and there are also some story progressions,0.060233552
that didn't seem off that logical to me while watching I thought it was fine,0.17873254
because I didn't know what was actually true and what was exaggerated or added for,0.03705825
the film version but now in that respect I guess some elements could have been,0.05672112
handled better because what a basic story about a black guy who infiltrated the Ku,0.5154597
Klux Klan is what happened pretty much everything else including most characters and also the,0.1795606
whole finale is fiction and that's not a bad thing after all this is art,0.08410926
and it takes something from reality to create something that shines a light back on,0.05339064
it and I think it's a very bright light maybe the comparison is a bit,0.08660542
far-fetched but it's the first thing that came to my mind and I don't think,0.15652093
it's that bad I know that Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino aren't really on good,0.15086909
terms but away Lee created something extraordinary basing his film on this true story Tarantino,0.10098106
did his own version of world war two with inglorious basterds and I think both,0.45733744
films are very entertaining and thought-provoking and empowering at the same time so in German,0.1497093
