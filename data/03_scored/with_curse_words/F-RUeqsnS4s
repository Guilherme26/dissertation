hey so today I'm going to be talking about the film moonlight I had a,0.037192445
chance to see it's why it was so good um so Mumma is directed by,0.054088924
Barry Jenkins and was co-written with Terrell mcrainey based off of a play that Terrell,0.14671314
actually did and then Barry came in and helped him finish writing the film I'm,0.06945598
so this film is starring my harsh on lolly travante roads and Andre Holland the,0.15398058
acting was so superb in this film I can't wait to delve into that and,0.11379754
they let in the later part of this video but who this one was so,0.110111296
good that has he is twice I'm the first time I saw it was through,0.08085274
a USC so University of Southern California I went to their cinema school so there,0.075058386
is the African American cinema society aacs and they put on an event with another,0.12674142
group named queer cut and that's how I was able to see this film before,0.105141714
I hit theaters and then of course my friend she's an actress and she invited,0.31746632
me to see it again and I was like all right I'll go ahead and,0.06724496
see it twice because that's how good it was and I also want to make,0.07845476
sure that supported in the box office it's sometimes hard for people who get like,0.06149199
exclusive sneak peeks and get to see films beforehand just do to like industry connections,0.07803042
but then we forget that you have to support it opening weekend when it comes,0.054103147
to the box office so this is a limited release but it's definitely more cities,0.08274757
now I know it's in Los Angeles and San Francisco New York and a few,0.03352335
other places so look it up and if it's in your area go see it,0.11689151
if it's about a couple hours away it's our trust me it's worth the draw,0.11169147
it's worth the drive for sure and i'm originally from sacramento so all my sacramento,0.12489847
people i promise you is worth that drives to the Bay Area next time you're,0.109928
in the bay go ahead and check it out was so good so really love,0.09849507
the music in this film the music was actually heavy and played a big role,0.09176472
in it because it's interesting like typically in films on here that much music so,0.116134524
it kind of like a music video at time and I really like that because,0.059451636
in films called the number one critique are always skates that put too much music,0.08860829
in my film they always critique me on that so I love this film because,0.1252233
I'm like finally it worked someone proved that you can have multiple songs playing really,0.06654042
loud in films and it just actually adds to the flume except taken away but,0.085944325
I always always always had that as a critique that like I didn't that I've,0.060290363
put too much music in my film so I really let's see so I sometimes,0.076643184
I did think that this man fini style music was a little too much I,0.38564092
think that the characters or the actors express their emotions enough and that the music,0.03674656
wasn't really needed and I feel like it just was forcing me to be more,0.09242321
sad trying to be a tearjerker but the film was a tearjerker on its own,0.18056579
there is no need for that so something left out the symphony music was a,0.07586789
little too much but I did like how they're different um there are different song,0.06601767
choices for each version or sirens life so when I looked on the playlist once,0.075746916
but on Spotify like the soundtrack to the film there's like a certain song for,0.09144697
Sharon and the child chevron has a teen then as an adult somebody like how,0.16689004
they play with those musical scores and how they gave a different musical score to,0.03246847
each character to one character but for each section of his life as he grew,0.043005556
so I really like that um also classic man by Gina chopped n skrewed was,0.45681608
Jean yes like it was so good when he pulled up and like put on,0.10900069
a fresh tea to go meet with Kevin after all these years and was playing,0.046842802
classic man and it was just it was perfect I love it um yeah it,0.2175699
was perfect that really reminds me a lot of like a typical Florida against the,0.17202966
kind of dude so they embodied that role so well so well um and also,0.10979352
I really really like the song it's pronounced coo coo coo coo coo paloma um,0.53490317
and that's the song that's played in the middle either in the car and it's,0.042793363
like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah koo koo roo Paloma and it's so beautiful I,0.2227752
did look it up online and luckily I caught like a live version with an,0.0891636
orchestra in the back and this man singing live in it's just such a beautiful,0.17373835
song so I suggest you all look it up it wasn't on the Spotify soundtrack,0.13605195
and to the film moonlight but I found it online on YouTube and it was,0.037013173
just so beautiful sea I love the way they used music at times I thought,0.08480562
it was a bit too heavy and made it a little bit too emotional but,0.15104616
everything about it was just so perfect I love love love they used a lot,0.06406057
of music in this the directing and the writing were so good so very jenkins,0.06865312
said that he was pulled out of retirement after seeing a play that l wrote,0.074073955
that was a sort of based off of the film moonlight so to pull Barry,0.041176047
Jenkins out of other words hired me like and now I understand why because this,0.14539935
story is so good and he was saying it also relates a lot to his,0.07695422
personal life so what I thought was really interesting from listening to the interview again,0.06558745
on fresh Air's that Barry was saying thats frills I really quiet and he was,0.063722484
saying in the okay so barians ro actually know each other actually grew up in,0.076562606
the same like apartment complex they went to the same school at the same time,0.061715215
in elementary so they've known each other for a very long time and bury the,0.19122727
director was sent teams to the co-writer Terrell Amen as long as I've known you,0.07175898
still can only say about six words and it's interesting because that's also a line,0.065203376
that Kevin uses for sure on in this so i love how even though of,0.090155244
course the variant or aren't romantically together they still kind of see themselves in the,0.074026346
worlds of kevin and in shy Ron and I think that plays really well for,0.081669115
the two writers because they're sort of expressing their friendship through this um this lovers,0.18231611
storyline so I really like that and the lighting was so so so so good,0.06991325
I love when we see this like pink lighting on the mom she's yelling at,0.35764965
chevron as a kid and Barry said that he did that because he remembered his,0.2620452
mom being like with the angry and being on drugs and he was a really,0.31293744
young child like he like under five years old and he just sort of i,0.30108473
think as a kid who just sort of remember things and colors you don't really,0.11413303
know what's going on and that's why it's silence when she's yelling at him at,0.23999707
first and juicy colors because in our memory that's what we see as kids no,0.15001053
colors and kind of see actions so i thought that was so beautiful but the,0.06355158
pink the hot pink sort of added to her her anger England hear what she,0.22220595
was saying we could just tell her she was screaming and the pink colors X,0.14932543
the passion so so well lit and of course the blue on the black on,0.34656397
the dark black skin representing the moonlight they reflected off the black skin that my,0.36045474
harsh realities character explains and that's how you got his nickname blue cuz she was,0.19164917
saying when the moonlight comes out and the boys play in the street in Cuba,0.09935962
that it makes the black boys with blue so I really loved a thought I,0.2904547
was I'm so beautiful and of course using blue light on dark skin actors is,0.36574194
you have two very talented you know how to light dark skinned people in general,0.65401053
because a lot of people just teach you how to how to light white actors,0.41329533
in films gorgeous give practice on different sets you just have more opportunities to light,0.1768566
white people vs dark-skinned people but the way that the colors reflected off his skin,0.67299056
especially the night scenes and the scenes and the water it was just so beautiful,0.0765839
so I love love love than not the lighting in here it really helped tell,0.10022701
this story more um and also I just love like it was sort of like,0.052360997
a love story between the writer and director about their friendship but also the love,0.052372437
story between shy Ron and Kevin and I'm a huge sucker for love story so,0.5876557
this one was so beautiful um yeah I just I loved it it was all,0.108025774
about like falling in love with the hood Florida man and i loved it was,0.23305912
so good so yeah i'm directing and writing were amazing and two talented people i'm,0.06113589
so glad i was into the interview so again go to I'm npr's website National,0.11331279
Public Radio watch the show fresh air it's hosted by terry gross and there's an,0.23946546
interview on there should be one of the most recent ones and it's with bear,0.09817547
jenkins and terrell mccraney and adds so much more detailed and insight so I saw,0.08195489
the film first then I listened to the interview and I went and saw the,0.034996238
film again and it helped me so much well I'll just like unpacking the film,0.042963147
and then with my own emotions and find my personal connection to the film I,0.056434743
just want to say that all the actors did such a great job in this,0.09246093
film they were superb there's a riveting performance from everyone I was shocked by the,0.057324484
younger actors the teenage actors everyone did is such a great job but for the,0.028475676
character of Kevin I literally love those actors so much they were my favorite they,0.07544494
made me kind of like this fall in love more with Kevin he's the love,0.12726949
interest in the film so I think it sort of worked but they honestly did,0.049966868
the best so Kevin as a teenage was played by jor-el Jerome such a cutie,0.050920766
and I think he did an amazing job he felt more comfortable in his role,0.07279257
as well I think he's supposed to be more confident actor because obviously our confident,0.082101196
character because obviously Kevin is more confident and himself then I'm shy Ron is then,0.08968565
also of course Andre Holland just like killed it as adult version of Kevin but,0.38873777
I really thought all the actors for the character of Kevin were just perfect on,0.05723915
spot you can so they're comfortable with their role they knew everything they were supposed,0.0504975
to do from their body language the way they spoke to their tone to everything,0.16613105
one of my favorite lines Andre hollandaise um when he looks at shy Ron and,0.12738608
he's like man right up in front song and it's funny because like a gold,0.24002372
grill and like it's called a front like oh your gold fronts that's what they're,0.11101072
called but it's sort of a play on words because the word front end is,0.05174635
also slang for someone who's faking the truth or not showing who they really are,0.3297714
so he keeps like adding line we got confront song like that but he's actually,0.12962995
saying like why are you fronting um so I just I really like to play,0.063747376
on words of course I was more not to go riding but just the way,0.090135254
he delivered that bad line it could have been very very corny like very corny,0.53568494
but he just uses like more of a play on words not I really loved,0.115339614
it so he was so smooth and again both jor-el and Andre were so confident,0.063525766
and comfortable in their roles so they did an amazing job you've seen the crackhead,0.25748008
black mom over and over again or the drug addict mother over and over again,0.80033493
but Naomi Harris just adding something different to it and also get a nod to,0.099786825
the writing wasn't it was a more loving depiction of a of a drug abusing,0.48263168
mother you know what I mean even though he wanted to hate Naomi cares no,0.54122585
me Harris his character we sort of so had love for her especially at the,0.089544676
end much I wrong goes and visits her at the rehab center the halfway house,0.09903405
so even though she's like obviously being a horrible mother and she has that scene,0.69542736
where she's telling him not to treat Janelle monáe's character better than her cuz she,0.16040564
is his mom as she's hustling him down for money she's obviously doing the action,0.36608422
that isn't that proves he's not a good mom but this means verbally saying like,0.24114724
I am your mom you're my one and only so she just she nailed it,0.53490317
she killed it she's amazing so happy to see what role she does after this,0.69542736
it was just a beauty to see her on-screen um also I've talked about mahakali,0.13635868
and other things I first saw him in house of cars then I found out,0.069964275
he was in cakes and then I saw him on Luke Cage so he's killing,0.6364068
it with the netflix TV shows and also the independent films so I love the,0.04656937
roles that he's choosing he is very talented he could play a villain if you,0.25154614
pay good guy and play a politician that you can play hood he's just really,0.15045382
nice I mean it's interesting because in the film kicks maresciallo also plays a like,0.13531318
gangster father figure um and he does that as well in this film but he,0.31089434
switches it up he's actually supposed to be from Cuba in this film and I,0.08094907
love how it's sort of a similar character but he didn't play it the same,0.036626898
way and that shows you the true talent of an actor anyway I can go,0.31089434
on and on about my her shallow so I also wanted to talk about Janelle,0.18198405
Monae this is the first time I've seen her on screen I'm i knows she's,0.15445036
also in the film hidden figures coming up we'll be doing a review on that,0.022137944
too hopefully but you know when I was really good I think towards the end,0.11141738
there were times where I thought she could have been a bit stronger when she,0.15924798
was making up the bed with the character of shy Ron and she was like,0.16295335
why would you you know do a bad job making up the babe try and,0.26126465
make me come over here and fix it on purpose I thought that wasn't that,0.13440314
strong um but she's still budding actress so I thought the way she played off,0.24062225
on my her shala was really good when she played with the younger version and,0.16397192
shy ron was really good so I enjoyed her and I loved her in this,0.14074194
world I'm happy to see her getting work also her hair looked perfect like in,0.1576376
every scene oh how she does it and Janelle Monae must have must be drinking,0.31089434
from the fountain of youth me my friend watching it were like why she was,0.14974518
19 like why does she look so young bene Raia it's like all-star amazing cast,0.14749241
fresh faces and some of them some of these faces we've seen before if you,0.11217471
off all theater you've seen some of these faces before but either way these are,0.15142244
not like a list celebrities yet they killed it is a very talented talented group,0.49229038
in the acting was amazing in this film so everyone go support the field might,0.0927226
it is an incredible film I can't guarantee that i'll make you cry but it'll,0.14934292
definitely make you think and feel i think this one was very important right now,0.08448267
to tell the narrative of a young black boy a young poor black boy and,0.60428566
a young poor black boy from the south especially with the way that black men,0.69542736
and women and young people are dying in this country I'm and being targeted by,0.3143475
police and other racist people which is really important to show this side that even,0.5154597
though someone might have a criminal record and might look very aggressive they actually just,0.13344538
a very very soft heart warming person on the inside so I think this one,0.16242878
so incredible perfect for our time right now I think this is a part of,0.080837816
the black artists of our time healing us because our people need a lot of,0.48675212
healing right now so this is definitely one for the books it's a classic I,0.054816656
love it so much so yeah go support moonlight thanks for watching this review in,0.052872073
