"Oh wow, big, thumbs up to the movie Selma"
The emotion in this movie is off the chart
It's a retelling of the pivotal time in the civil Rights movement and suffered for black Americans and the role Mlk played in it
"While the movie easily could have turned into a dry biography of Martin Luther King, The producers expertly present the events in this movie with the level of intensity power"
All that captivates the movie of yours
The slow motion effects using the most violent scenes make the movie even more resident
"David Oi Lol was Mlk, Who's also British, if you didn't know, Does an incredible job"
He embodies Mlk spirit and delivers true power
just like the rail out
Okay in each and every one of his speeches
My soul Complete in this movie was that the ending was slightly anti-climatic I was expecting a strong and emotional ending and we just didn't get it overall
"Despite the lackluster ending, this movie was a fantastic production with great picture directing and flawless acting"
I highly suggested you
