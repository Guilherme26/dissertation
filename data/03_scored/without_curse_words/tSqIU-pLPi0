Toy Story 4 I don't think I'd be reaching to say that the majority of,0.10136544
us were worried about this movie as a trilogy taury Story 1 2 & 3,0.09344819
was highly satisfying critics liked it people liked it it ended really well I was,0.10746877
honestly terrified about this film I tried to remain optimistic and hopeful about film but,0.07092064
when it came to Toy Story 4 I did find myself cynical because when you,0.2720272
have a trilogy that's actually satisfying it's kind of scary when they decide to make,0.08927349
another one Raiders of the Lost Ark Temple of Doom Last Crusade it's done Bourne,0.0659628
Identity supremacy and ultimatum done it's really hard to make a good trilogy that's as,0.16493157
satisfying as the Toy Story trilogy was and so when they said they were gonna,0.10365891
make another one I was really concerned I walked out of a movie a few,0.08590393
weeks ago and I heard somebody behind me they passed the Toy Story 4 poster,0.12731846
and they said there is no way that that movie is going to be good,0.0595127
I cannot wait to see that movie and laugh at it because it's going to,0.06974004
be awful and I remember thinking Jesus like that's a little much they haven't even,0.35311905
made a bad toys Story movie yet hell they haven't even made a mediocre Toy,0.5876557
Story movie yet they're all great I was cynical about this movie and I was,0.25733888
really worried about it and when I sat down the theater I thought to myself,0.08984784
this movie can do nothing but surprise me but I wasn't like this is going,0.14986622
to suck I really wanted it to be good and it really surprised me this,0.8138097
film was a blast from start to finish and extremely emotionally satisfying and I do,0.12345935
believe that Toy Story 4 has the potential to become maybe the prime argument whenever,0.052636012
someone is defending the continuation of a franchise beyond its initial completion I thought three,0.1029983
was the perfect ending and I didn't really see them doing anything else with these,0.16330571
characters and what I was really concerned about was the fourth film just being yet,0.07455295
another episodic adventure and there are times where it feels like that but it was,0.0671999
so well done that I didn't care and then without telling you anything it's like,0.076502904
oh you were doing things with these characters I see where you wanted this to,0.073563114
go yes in some ways the film is easily able to say let's do some,0.07104686
more which is a little business and commerce' you know and you're like oh I,0.073156394
see when you're doing and doing more more movies but if they're going to be,0.07922999
this good I'm fine with it let's talk about Josh Cooley what a feature debut,0.10652981
this is beautifully directed the way he moves characters in and around the screen the,0.06360136
action sequences the emotional beats he does a terrific job this is a really really,0.07138356
well-made movie and the animation has gotten to the point where it is photorealistic there's,0.065373965
an opening sequence where the entire scene is in the rain and there's characters underneath,0.058575965
a car and there's these little beads of water just dropping off of the pipes,0.11726302
it looked real it did not look like animation it is insane the level of,0.15221289
animation Pixar has reached what's also really tough to do in a franchise like Toy,0.102176905
Story is have a brand new villain every time because the Toy Story films they,0.115918264
don't have like a continuing villain storyline and so they have to have a new,0.10277697
thing every time and what they do here really was unexpected to me at first,0.14850931
it was almost like a horror movie which reminded me of Sid in the first,0.17705956
film and I've always loved how dark that film got the very first one where,0.032566782
buzz looks at them they're cannibals I remember even when I was like eight years,0.44541335
old I was like oh cannibal toys I didn't say those words but that's what,0.14810967
I was feeling inside the introductory scene for this character there is a shining reference,0.059523832
with the choice of music and I was like yep I'm on board you got,0.08660535
me in fact that's not the only Kubrick reference in the film there's another one,0.06445431
for 2001 Space Odyssey if you're listening very closely they play around a lot with,0.08755085
the villains storyline in this movie to make it different and it goes in a,0.073332086
direction that I really didn't expect it to and it was not something I could,0.041001223
have predicted which is great it just it somehow surprised me I don't know how,0.10011984
this children's film the fourth and the franchise did but it did but one of,0.09920985
the most important storylines in the film is this new toy made from a spork,0.04785483
that Bonnie names for key and Woody is trying to protect this thing because it's,0.054214373
so important to Bonnie like I said it was that one connection she made on,0.0796733
that first orientation day that made her think okay maybe school is gonna be alright,0.09622423
so woody naturally feels very protective of his kid and wants to make sure she's,0.17511731
safe and happy so now he's got to protect forky who has no idea what,0.18164268
the hell's going on he doesn't know he's a toy doesn't know what he is,0.5477429
and it's not exactly the same as like the Buzz Lightyear woody dynamic from the,0.057256464
first one where buzz thought he was a real Space Ranger this is different this,0.083980486
is like a weird amalgam nation of something that has been created and it has,0.17070535
no idea exactly what it is and so what he has to make sure this,0.07807321
thing is protected and in that way we get a lot of scenes where he's,0.064186946
essentially being a father which was one of my favorite themes about the film protecting,0.058145124
those we love how far is too far how far is overprotective you know and,0.062950075
a lot of that comes into bo-peep in this movie which is just the best,0.06636658
that character has ever been easily like she got a major upgrade as a character,0.08785127
and she's awesome here and the movie does play a lot with the relationship between,0.06188735
Woody and Bo Peep while in the first film it was sort of like a,0.08507359
flirtatious relationship that had absolutely no depth to it here we have a fully fleshed,0.09426046
out relationship and it's handled beautifully when it comes to comedies I'm a tough laugh,0.09769431
I like clever humor I like humor that makes me think about a situation or,0.08601895
something that we're normally thinking of or just very crass humor dry humor and when,0.0923822
it comes to Toy Story 4 there's surprisingly a lot of that there's actually a,0.06003282
few offensive jokes even and I was like okay this franchise still understands that in,0.10934017
the first one we had Buzz Light beer and we had the word I'm searching,0.078880616
for I can't say because there are a preschool toys present getting kind of tense,0.094216645
aren't you so we have a scary horror like set up with the villain characters,0.23991863
and some adult humor in other words this movie didn't play it safe which I,0.062250946
was really afraid it was gonna be this squeaky clean 2019 Disney movie but it,0.17627425
this is a Pixar film I didn't feel like I was watching like a studio,0.10919583
movie that checked all the boxes Pixar knows their and they did a damn good,0.494014
job making this movie and it really surprised me when it comes to the emotional,0.11512238
beats I didn't expect to be as wrapped up in it as I was and,0.09028738
again I I don't want to give you any details but there comes a point,0.10917684
in the film where you sort of realize what they were doing with the characters,0.06312631
what at one point in time did feel kind of episodic suddenly becomes more than,0.09066291
that and you realize holy you were setting this up all along and I never,0.104289554
even considered that and the waterworks just and I was done and like I think,0.06461261
I lost it more in this movie than did in Toy Story 3 even as,0.09752725
far as new characters go Duke KABOOOM voiced by Keanu Reeves is awesome he's a,0.092572734
Canadian stunt man and he's hilarious it was a perfect role for Keanu Reeves key,0.14985771
and Peele played two plushies that can be won at a carnival they were really,0.05018716
funny all of the new characters especially for key risk being annoying because they're around,0.14897233
a lot and I never was in fact four key was actually really sweet and,0.06560369
I couldn't believe that I liked him because when I saw the teaser I was,0.07996626
like oh he's gonna annoy me I just know it I know it but no,0.23314841
I actually really liked that character and I know this isn't a reference to the,0.05024459
anime but if you happen to be a fan of the very obscure anime buh,0.16894788
buh buh buh buh buh buh there's a scene where you will not be able,0.17555968
to help but hear that title in your head I know it's not a reference,0.1465668
to that show but as a fan of anime and you know I knew if,0.0849114
that show I was like haha that's funny that they just gotta set it there,0.05659204
really was no dull moment in Toy Story 4 there was never a scene that,0.103908114
I felt dragged it felt shorter than its runtime it was consistently entertaining and it,0.08737544
is yet again another fantastic Toy Story movie if I were to try to talk,0.06081527
about flaws I feel like I would be reaching a lot like I mean it's,0.09058103
like it's there I know I could find it it's right here oh yeah I,0.069130644
found a flaw look at me good for me I would say my only issue,0.15781951
with the movie is that I wish there were more woody buzz scenes there's some,0.07384726
heartfelt stuff there's just not a lot it wasn't this movie's focus and to me,0.08207395
that relationship has really anchored these films would have liked to have seen a little,0.09614988
more of that and like I said there are times where this adventure they're on,0.04078918
does feel a little inconsequential until you see where they're going with it and you're,0.07504123
like oh okay so this actually was necessary to get to that point I understand,0.12077887
that now that's it this is a great movie I am blown away by how,0.10603548
good this movie was I did not expect it to be this good so maybe,0.08691248
go in with that mentality go in expecting to be underwhelmed and maybe you'll have,0.26512554
a good time with it I'm gonna give Toy Story 4 and a I am,0.056760076
just I'm I'm so happy that this movie didn't suck I really honestly thought it,0.69542736
was going to I really did I was just I don't usually get cynical about,0.22746924
movies like this I was just like it kind of started to affect me like,0.14463018
why do we need this movie it doesn't have to happen and then you know,0.091884114
I sat there and it was great so yay you know forget those thoughts just,0.046811365
go enjoy yourself have a good time guys thank you so much as always for,0.18847553
watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like this you can,0.120114736
