I'm gonna be completely honest I do not know how the YouTube algorithm is gonna deal with this video because the title of this movie is black clansmen spelt like this in which case these letters in sequence are part of the title in respect to the filmmaker respect to Spike Lee that's how he wants the title to be I will have the title like that in this video so the YouTube algorithm might bury the video my dia monetize it I don't know we'll see what happens [Music] black clansmen so black clansmen is the insane true story taking place in 1979 a black cop officer ron Stallworth played by john david washington yes that is Denzel Washington son and he's great in the movie sometimes when we talk to you like that is Denzel he essentially answers an ad in the paper for the Ku Klux Klan so he infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan which when I heard the promise I was like is it a comedy like Clayton Bigsby from Chappelle's Show it is not a comedy it is a very heavy drama it does have comedy in it and I appreciated that but unless the Klan went completely blind in the 70s he couldn't show up to meet them so he talks to them on the phone and Adam drivers character he goes and meets that so both of them essentially play the same person for the most part I've really enjoyed this movie like I said it's heavy I mean the content is very heavy it's mostly heavy because you know for a fact this movie is a message to today to modern-day to us because those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it and the hate circle it's still there you look online on social media on Twitter whatever you just feel like we're going in a circle as we circle the drain down the toilet bowl and while I have made videos in the past talking about how I don't feel every movie needs a political or social message in it sometimes a movie needs to be an escape it escapism is real black clansmen is not one of those movies you go to to escape I mean when I saw the trailer I was like that movie's going to have a message is gonna be very relevant to today if you don't think that going into this movie you're fooling yourself in fact it should be one of the reasons you go to this movie so if you don't like that or don't want that you have been warned what the movie does very well is it does show sides I mean it's not like a wolf done the Klan they're just doing their thing hate but you know perspective it's not like that they do show them all meeting and they do come across you just like oh hi Chuck you have some burgers because you can't really pick out a bigot you can't go to the mall and just be like that's a racist that's not a racist doesn't work like that but also the Black Panthers are a part of this movie and when Ron Stallworth is talking from someone from the Black Panthers that is a very fascinating conversation because conversation is well you're the enemy and he's like I'm a cop and I'm trying to do good I'm trying to help you so I really liked the movie Illustrated sometimes people who are fighting for the same thing just see each other as the enemy the movie does have a couple of Donald Trump references and oh some people just say they knock a lot date back when they hear that but I felt like it was within character David Duke in this movie played by Topher Grace I thought I did a great job too maybe dude being the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan but David Duke in real life has said he likes like he's advocated for Trump so when David Duke in this movie makes a reference about one day someone will be in office that makes America great again I don't think David Duke said the words make America great again in 1979 obviously David Duke likes Trump so we must have something in his mind at some time that Trump would then later say that would click with him so it's just showing that connection so it's within character not like the purge marketing department trying to play up to make America great again thing where I'm like that's a mag a hat and the Trump administration is not going to make the purge happen you're just over reaching purge movies I do feel things got really real in the end credits but I also feel like he really stuck that landing with the end credits or it was right before the end credit it shows real footage of recent times and your force it just gives you pause you have to think about it just like Spike Lee was like no we're gonna have this conversation because we've been having the conversation for a little over two hours now here's the cherry on top you have to ask after that [ __ ] in Charlottesville Virginia like why couldn't the president just get up there and be like all black people out there know this we are not going back in time please do not be afraid of that we are moving forward we are a progressive nation when I said I wanted to make America great again what I meant was take it back to the booming economy I did not mean I was gonna isolate you please know that we will make America better than before with everybody as equals including you [ __ ] the Ku Klux Klan like why couldn't you just say that I don't get too political I'm here but but why message aside as a movie narrative Lee speaking I thought the movie was actually it was very engaging it's not the most exciting thing ever but when Adam driver is there amidst this Ku Klux Klan rally you're just like don't get caught at all I did appreciate the humor when it was in everything like I said this movie is not a comedy it is a drama the movie is so applicable the modern day sometimes it just feels heavy and with that heaviness you need something you need to laugh sometimes the movie gives you a few chuckles now and then I appreciated that because life has chuckles no matter what like there's nothing on earth no form of entertainment no medium has so perfectly blended all genres as well as life itself has so when a drama has comedy it's just life I do feel like the movie has some pacing issues sometimes I mean the movies 2 hours 20 minutes near the end the last third of the movie I was like this is dragging on you could pick it up whereas I feel like that should have been sped up there are some times with the girlfriend who is a part of the Black Panthers she's great when she's on screen but I forget about her when she's not and then the movie goes back to her after a long oh yeah that's right she's a part of it I felt like that was a little uneven and there were some stylistic choices when the intense thing is happening when it is going down it's it's 70s music which it takes place in the 70s should make sense but when watching it it just doesn't I just imagined more intense music playing and I would have been on the edge of my seat it's not the only questionable stylistic choice in this movie this Black Panther leader is talking he's giving a speech you're like it was a very engaging speech but it cuts to the audience listening to it but it's not the audience really it's certain heads in the audience that are like fading in and out there's a strange cult guys in the end I really enjoyed black Klansmen it's an insane tale that's a true story everyone did a great job in an atom drivers fantastic John David Washington want to see more of him the movies not perfect but it sticks the landing of its message it was engaging it was thrilling at times and I personally thought it was a great time no alcohol required there was actually a really great philosophical moment that lends itself to a debate and here he's talking about this movie Birth of a Nation I've never seen it but apparently it really empowered the Ku Klux Klan so this movie changed the world in which case you could argue art changes reality but the phrase has always been art imitates reality so if reality is changed by art but then art imitates reality it is very circular it's like the source of the reflection becoming the reflection it just goes back and forth that is another conversation for the people to have at their whim all right so black Klansmen have you seen it what did you think about it whatever you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and
