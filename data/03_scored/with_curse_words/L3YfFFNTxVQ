you know I had a dream that one day someone would actually make a film,0.15570816
about Martin Luther King jr. and handle it in a very truthful accurate and respectful,0.08100295
manner and it looks like that dream has come true hey guys the black corner,0.40328318
guy today I'm here to review the film Selma now the film Selma takes place,0.07084489
in a very tumultuous time in US history where segregation was alive and well in,0.11779532
the south and it follows the demonstrations and peaceful protests by Martin Luther King jr.,0.11687269
and how he got it all together none of my knowledge and I could be,0.093535624
wrong about this but I don't think there has ever been a theatrical film made,0.08607167
about Martin Luther King jr. sure there's been a lot of TV movies TV specials,0.12521046
documentaries and miniseries about the man but never a full-on theatrical film about Martin Luther,0.14685813
King and it could be because with all of his contributions to the world and,0.05174898
countless of good things he has done to sum it all up in a two-hour,0.10283468
long movie I just wouldn't do the man any justice so I guess nobody wanted,0.123668045
to attack that but seeing Selma I think they really picked a very monumental time,0.25991726
in Maher Luther King's life to show on the big screen and what I really,0.24253617
appreciate about this film is that it does it takes place after all the things,0.1094586
that we really remember Maher Luther King 4 it takes place after his speech at,0.1262646
Washington DC it takes place after he won his Nobel Peace Prize it takes place,0.109073065
after all the major events that we've come to know about Martin Luther King and,0.0697633
it's like the events afterwards this takes place I believe in 1965 in Selma Alabama,0.05225464
and I really praised the movie for doing that they easily could have been like,0.06997865
this is the life of Martin Luther King we're gonna go through all of it,0.12430242
and we're gonna end on like the big speech though they actually address one key,0.11349627
moment in Maher Luther King's life basically they pulled a Lincoln with this movie we're,0.16955857
focused on one major event in the man's life and really showed it to us,0.15519685
and in my honest and humble opinion I believe that this was the perfect time,0.07201645
for a film like Selma to be released especially after all the events that have,0.052377384
occurred in the last few years because people need to be reminded of the struggle,0.08988433
of the trials and tribulations that the people face back in the 1950s and 60s,0.09079642
they need to be reminded of the people that sacrifice their lives to give us,0.3400846
the rights that we have today and people need to be inspired to make a,0.050312456
change and needless to say I thought that someone was a great and fantastic film,0.1437406
and one that I truly respect in the fact that it doesn't really follow the,0.05214063
same trend as other films that talk about the civil rights movement before it I,0.114951774
mean yes they do shine a light on the civil rights movement and they do,0.079391226
show it as a justification to it and I found that so intriguing I was,0.066021696
hoping that this film could stand out amongst the other civil rights type films and,0.122215085
I think that it truly does and it stands out for many reasons the biggest,0.08622722
one being its portrayal of the man that was Martin Luther King jr. they do,0.10122115
not put this guy on a pedestal they do not treat him as a God,0.48081738
among men as I've seen in TV specials and heard in documentaries they show dr.,0.081168294
King for what he truly was he was a man he had faults he had,0.24257095
a lot of faults that were addressed in the film he had doubts there was,0.069266066
a scene where he's in the jail cell he's talking to one of the people,0.26679322
that I can guessing is his friend and he's talking about you know is what,0.061684143
we're doing really going to help is it really going to change you know we,0.0740265
could get a man to sit down in a dining table but he can't pay,0.31817874
for the burger at the diner he had hesitations this was same where he's standing,0.078247935
on the bridge he's wondering whether I should push forward or if he should just,0.20130919
turn back he was a man and I loved how the film humanized dr. King,0.17792012
they in put him on a pedestal that is the most perfect representation of King,0.100592114
I've seen in a movie thus far and that is all attributed to the excellent,0.061127543
performance done by this guy I cannot pronounce his last name and I would hate,0.41493762
to butcher it so I'll put his name right here but I'm gonna call him,0.60497004
David oh this guy he did such a phenomenal job portraying dr. Martin Luther King,0.117379256
now at first scared because his voice didn't really capture the voice that was Martin,0.09717268
Luther King Jr's voice I've heard Martin Luther King's voice so many times I could,0.07609677
tell it from a mile away but when I heard his voice didn't really sound,0.07388304
like him and I was a little scared and hesitant to really see him as,0.15197828
Martin Luther King but as the film continued I just got sucked into his performance,0.71477866
especially when he is preaching to the crowd I felt the presence of Martin Luther,0.064925194
King right there I could feel it radiating out of him I hope he gets,0.15767
nominated I don't know if he'll win but if he gets nominated I'm gonna be,0.115860835
so happy because his performance is truly Oscar worthy one of the best performances I've,0.0734025
seen of the year though riding in the film was excellent and I loved how,0.025531828
they addressed all the struggles all the pressure and all the conflict that dr. King,0.06245902
had to face during the Selma protest you would think that a film called Selma,0.11214972
would only focus on the town of Selma and what Martin Luther King jr. did,0.090457655
in that town but no the film also addresses what he was dealing with meeting,0.053354315
with the president in Washington DC and trying to push the Voting Rights Act it,0.068723686
shows his marital struggle to keep his marriage alive because there's a lot of issues,0.24246347
going on right there I love that the film addressed this because I've heard about,0.04530274
for years but I always thought no one would ever see that port in film,0.0771829
and they did they addressed it in this film to actually put it on screen,0.08961951
and gave it so much attention and focus I love that now although I felt,0.09369316
like the film's representation of the march and the brutality by the police was done,0.31089434
very well and unfiltered I felt like they kind of withheld on showing a little,0.18153185
bit more of the gruesomeness of that scene I felt like it was probably more,0.28058746
gruesome and more damaging than what we actually saw but for the scene that were,0.3763398
there they were brutal and they were really hard to watch it was just gut-wrenching,0.14884171
to think that people would actually do like this and it did happen and the,0.07760957
sad part is it continues to happen I was like the fact that they gave,0.07712888
dr. King a sense of humor I mean there are some scenes where he's talking,0.08531664
to his buddies and it just feels like a natural conversation and they're just joking,0.09454267
around I wish the more scenes like that but of course it's all about the,0.06050416
events that are going down the struggles that he's facing but it would have been,0.065397926
nice to see more downtime that dr. King had with his friends I mean those,0.240457
scenes were really well done it really captures the normal life that dr. King sort,0.07346974
of lived now and again I guess the last thing I want to talk about,0.08008532
and praise about this film was the acting I already praised David OHS performance of,0.0899096
dr. King but everybody else also did a really good job and there's just so,0.036929246
many notable performances like I thought Tom Wilkinson did a really good job at portraying,0.09630845
lyndon b johnson i felt like he captured him perfectly overall guys i love this,0.15032063
film this film really touched me it really spoke to me this is probably one,0.17973132
of the best films about the civil rights movement i probably have ever seen it,0.082598865
if i had seen it in 2014 it definitely would have been in my top,0.08044832
ten of the year and it would have been number one that's how great it,0.05316386
was all the performances were solid they were genuine everything about this film I just,0.06037964
felt like clicked and I could not take my eyes off the screen I was,0.12518007
in trans by the story at the events that were occurring on screen and the,0.027413677
performances that each and every actor and actress in this film gave it is an,0.05357507
amazing and phenomenal film and I really hope that you guys go and check it,0.11422751
out because it is getting the highest grade it could ever get on this channel,0.1409075
that's the 5 out of 5 but it's not an epic masterpiece it's just a,0.055293333
masterpiece it's an excellent work of film and I just loved it and in recommending,0.04210563
films that are very similar to summer you guys should definitely check out Malcolm X,0.0819249
starring Denzel Washington as the militant leader he does a really good job at conveying,0.108843364
and capturing the man that was Malcolm X in fact he earned an Academy Award,0.0734743
nomination for his portrayal that's how good it was I would also recommend that you,0.1516753
check out Lincoln which also has a very similar set up and then it takes,0.045225635
place in a very crucial moment in this very important person's life but anyway I,0.15294288
would truly love to know what you guys thought about this film if you have,0.14807808
seen it did you love it as much as I did did you feel like,0.07181239
it was a mask Peace in an excellent film or did it just not live,0.1899198
up to what you were hoping and he felt like it was emotionally manipulative and,0.23985298
totally bias and let me know who is your favorite social activists somebody that fights,0.16480666
injustice in the world comment below let me know and I know I took this,0.10978197
review a little bit more seriously but the film called for a series of you,0.13528688
and that's exactly what I did so until the next video comes guys if you,0.121467486
