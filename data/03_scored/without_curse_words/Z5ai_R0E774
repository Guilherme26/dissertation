hello this review is going to be ever so slightly different to my typical reviews,0.07653084
not that there's going to be any drastic changes to the format and honestly surface,0.045558825
level it won't be noticeably different at all it's more of a behind the scenes,0.15315267
difference there's two things that i usually do before shooting these movie reviews and it's,0.31089434
one i'll re-watch or watch for the first time the movie and then two i'll,0.0755625
do like bullet point notes i don't write a script for the reviews i don't,0.14872845
think i read scripts too well i think i start to sound too robotic and,0.0865501
clunky i find it just easier to kind of shoot from the hip so to,0.67051417
speak but i do have like a list of notes that i read from and,0.07168238
read off of just to make sure i don't forget any points or anything i,0.13335246
wanted to talk about and i decided not to do that for this review of,0.07211485
seven samurai uh the 1954 akira kurosawa masterpiece and the reason i decided not to,0.10294244
do that is because of the relationship i have with the film i don't watch,0.0732493
it super regularly i think i've maybe only seen it three or four times i,0.065485194
watch it sparsely because it feels kind of like an event and like a ritual,0.1801755
whenever i watch it and i thought to re-watch it with the intent of reviewing,0.10905592
it might spoil that you know almost religious ritual aspect that i have with the,0.09784507
film uh and i really wanted to avoid that because sometimes that happens and it,0.12618524
doesn't happen all the time but i thought with a three-hour movie where i have,0.055776734
preemptively decided to watch it with the intent of reviewing it i was kind of,0.07597484
worried that i might start to be too critical and dampen my experience maybe i,0.06246675
wouldn't have i don't know i just didn't want to take the risk but i,0.06092418
think that akira kurosawa seven samurai very well might be the greatest film ever made,0.07214754
i don't know if it's my favorite movie but when i just think of a,0.0677599
movie that artistically and i sound like such a douchebag saying that but a movie,0.76837975
that you know just the craftsmanship left me in such awe and left me both,0.08493639
intimidated and infatuated with the genre with the art form uh you know like i,0.052724592
i just wanted to speak from the heart because i also part of my relationship,0.053355396
with seven samurais that i find myself quite frequently just kind of sitting around going,0.08035062
like man that's a good movie like it's great and so that's what i'm doing,0.24600975
here right now is i'm kind of just recording the thoughts that i have about,0.062567696
that movie every now and again it goes without saying that i recommend that movie,0.10316735
to anybody uh although i do find it to be a hard recommendation i recommend,0.18124166
it because i think so i recommend it because i think so highly of it,0.07652283
but it's an older japanese film so if you don't speak japanese you're going to,0.24249314
be reading subtitles uh and i know some people don't like reading subtitles it's black,0.6364068
and white and i know some people don't enjoy black and white films those are,0.2838226
two points that i find very unfortunate but are a reality um it's also three,0.11093038
hours long again another thing that isn't a problem for me but i realize that,0.0650171
some peop movie goers like their movies two hours or under and sometimes even two,0.18857819
hours is pushing it so with that in mind movie is beautiful the cinematography is,0.099816024
drop dead gorgeous the black and white is just jaw-dropping and the way that it,0.44537705
uses weather and music it's saw just compliments each other phenomenally the weather especially every,0.05574226
frame of painting which is a great youtube channel i don't think he's uploading anymore,0.1933107
but he does a great video on kirsawa's the movement of the kirasawa's films akira,0.12708347
kurosawa i kind of blurred mixed his name his name first and last name together,0.1382121
there um but it just heightens all the emotions that you're feeling and i think,0.11492921
that there's just something incredibly human about the story the desire to defend your home,0.19092314
mixed with a slightly higher concept of defending somebody else's home and being honorable and,0.07888027
doing the right thing and sacrifice and i think all those things are told on,0.13821802
such an emotional level that i don't think i've seen in another movie maybe ever,0.100491524
and a kind of a roundabout way of saying but it's just like when you're,0.0827006
in these battles there's these uh great battle scenes and for those of you who,0.14315729
don't know and again i'm sorry i'm rambling like i said i didn't take my,0.11417701
notes this is the inspiration the genesis of the magnificent seven where it's about seven,0.062306058
samurai who go to defend a village from bandits and so you have these samurai,0.40337616
and these villagers fighting to defend this village from these raiders and the emotions that,0.06499971
the characters are going through with the honor and respect and you know fighting for,0.053295646
dignity and fighting for their home and the water is just pouring from the heavens,0.071427464
and just drenching everything and they're scrambling through the mud uh it just it's overwhelming,0.3189605
to be honest it's it's a little bit overwhelming and you're sitting there in awe,0.13889225
and i find myself just lost in it and it's a three-hour movie but i,0.107396334
feel like i blink and it's over and i i don't want to make it,0.10158873
sound like this is just a wholly emotional experience in terms of drama it's not,0.09458895
just dramatic from start to finish i think the assembling of the team of the,0.1383001
seven samurai is incredibly fun and honestly one of the highlights of the movie what,0.12478725
am i saying the entire movie is a highlight i mentioned earlier that the music,0.07822999
coupled with the cinematography and the weather just helps heighten the emotions i couldn't hum,0.056050587
you a beat from it but i know that every time i'm listening to it,0.21403258
it's not a distraction it just feels right it just fits all the performances are,0.07353088
top notch the body language the physicality the emotion on people's faces is second to,0.15331645
none and then i could get into some more technical elements like the sound design,0.10102521
sound effects uh practical special effects set deck all of it's perfect and authentic you,0.14873877
don't look at anything and go that doesn't seem right or that doesn't sound right,0.09406869
which is i think probably for most moviegoers rare to begin with you're not normally,0.15519175
sitting there going like ah the fully artist didn't do too great a job on,0.07947749
dish one uh but in seven samurai it just all feels i don't want to,0.10490104
say like a documentary but it feels like you've just been dropped into the world,0.20819953
yeah it's a masterpiece when you're looking at it it's like being sucked into feudal,0.5809088
japan and the rest of the world just stops existing i strongly recommend watching it,0.49681595
on the biggest tv you can get taking the blinds down shutting off all the,0.14746374
lights getting your surround sound set up and if you don't have surround sound just,0.082918935
maxing out your tv's volume and just getting totally immersed in the movie i think,0.12138721
for the first time on this channel uh i'm giving a movie a perfect 10,0.15379746
