hello and welcome back to mac at the movies today,0.049348503
i'm going to review for you,0.11732439
the 2019 french film portrait of a lady on fire,0.24143194
uh this was directed by celine siama who also directed waterlily's girlhood tomboy and my life as a zucchini which later got a u.s release all done by american voice actors it's a it's a claymated film nick alfriman,0.49117172
michael sarah few people are in it really good film check it out this,0.14733043
one was released on lily's lily's films uh september 18th 2019 uh it stars adele han hanel who plays heloise uh noemie merlant who plays mariana luana beijirim luana beijrami who plays sophie and valerie gallino who plays d the mother d doesn't uh play a huge role throughout the film it primarily follows heloise uh mariana who is the woman who is hired to paint heloise and sophie who is essentially like a chamber girl maid,0.12265062
if you will in the film the film does take place in france,0.06378391
and it was filmed primarily uh in uh brittany uh they just wanted the beautiful landscapes,0.053331185
and it is beautiful,0.07056108
when you see it it,0.067518085
i mean it,0.06970505
it's a period piece but i don't believe that anywhere in the film they discuss a matter of what year or time period,0.09144002
i know the director has stated in the past that some of the movies that she's done,0.07157737
she doesn't want to give an exact timeline that just wants to focus on the film itself as like a piece of art,0.13000858
and by having a timeline it sort of takes away from the overall story and kind of gives you know question of why would they be using this particular cell phone and this year you know things like that so by taking that out of the picture,0.066743076
you're kind of given this you know ambiguous timeline of when the the film could have been taken place,0.098933995
um,0.012811388
a good example of that if any of you have seen the horror film it follows um it's kind of left to the ambiguity of time,0.09665897
because like the device is being used or anything being used isn't really time um,0.061241735
it can't really put a time stamp on when the film takes place uh which i feel really brings you into the picture as a whole um,0.15157863
i mean this is obvious obviously a time piece is takes place a long long time ago um and you know that's kind of what you know,0.23442209
and so it allows you to really get into the story um all in all i love this movie uh which i'll talk about later um,0.11644697
and and what i liked more about it uh so mariana she is hired to paint eloise who is uh dee's daughter,0.241054
she's brought in they've had people other artists brought in to paint before,0.12311392
but i suppose the paintings were never to the liking of uh heloise and she you know she would destroy the painting something would happen it just wouldn't get done um which i'll discuss here in a minute or reasons why i think that happened um,0.119509555
so she's brought in to essentially paint the portrait of heloise in secret,0.095064685
so she spends a lot of time she's she's brought in to to to spend time with eloise and to you know get a good memory,0.14570269
of what she looks like you know taking notes along the way she she brings um,0.19705358
you know just a little sketching pieces of paper to you know if she notices the way she places her hands things like that,0.30132347
so she has to essentially put this portrait together by memory,0.17218263
one thing i i enjoy is the the times that they spin together they start to learn about one another,0.09263471
you find out that,0.09950147
at the beginning of the film elise's sister died she jumped off a cliff some people thought,0.15537298
it was an accident um sophie the the the chambermaid,0.17067519
she believes that the sister jumped uh intentionally uh and when uh mariana asked her why she thought that she said because when it happened she didn't cry out,0.15472819
she just turned around she was gone and looked over and and noticed that that she had left to her death um hello east and mariana,0.14990135
they talk on the beach,0.13148335
uh later in the film uh marianna's trying to get more information about luis and like who she is to i supposed to you know spend more time with her of course because she has to get that image of her in her memory to to create the portrait,0.13332555
but she's not afraid to ask questions that other people may have tiptoed around like the death of her sister,0.6364068
what happened,0.05228998
and so one of the questions she brings up is you know,0.073974416
she asked like what about your sister's death you know she finds out that uh that it was,0.5746678
and uh there was an apology letter left behind and she asked like why what did she apologize about and eloise tells her essentially she apologized for passing her fate along to her sister which later gets discussed like what fate,0.14207897
and that's when the idea of an arranged marriage,0.07897968
a a more in-depth understanding of an arranged marriage,0.05161159
that's going to be taking place between uh eloise and another man who she's never met so this is when i start to understand that it's not so much that eloise doesn't want her portrait taken like once her portrait created i think it's more of a not wanting an example of a time that she can look back to and say this is when i was happy that's what i gathered from it anyway,0.24776308
so you kind of see that she's unhappy with the idea that she's going to have this arranged marriage and any time that there is a portrait done of her she either protests sitting for it or there there's a destruction of the the portrait where you see the the the one portrait the last one that was done the face was smudged out i i think the the reason behind all that is that she doesn't want this example of a time that was better,0.18348175
so if she's in this you know miserable,0.7447364
uh marriage like she doesn't want to remember that there ever was happiness before that she just wants to know what is,0.1168826
so maybe a portrait made after her being married it would just signify,0.14993274
what you know she knows from that point,0.08278446
she has no memory or anything to remind her of what would you know make,0.32021397
her think about those moments um the you know the mariana,0.07862188
she is essentially she is made to follow louise uh again to get to know her but she is suggested to let her go on her own one day um which heloise did not understand really um and which i get you know that's the sort of the point that she's there is to be like she doesn't know that she's painting the portrait so she just thinks she's there to accompany her to make sure i suppose she doesn't do anything brash on her own and mariana suggests she go by herself one day you know just six suggests solitude,0.13975115
and when she does that uh eloise comes back,0.10986565
she returns after that and she was just like you know that was a great idea,0.10107732
you know i i had all this time to to think about this,0.096977055
and think about that she you know asked like what she thought about,0.09866766
and she louise tells mariana that she thought about how she missed her so she kind of introduces this idea of solitude and how you can you know how how solitude can sort of give a person time to think about other things or other people,0.09624194
and how if you weren't alone to your own devices,0.18782674
would you ever have those thoughts,0.078829244
and and i like the idea of that um you know one thing i personally like to do uh myself is a lot of things by myself,0.16777298
so you know going out to a restaurant and just having a you know one-person meal and just enjoying my time alone or going to a movie by myself,0.10479604
there's just me involved in that movie and you know it just,0.06194915
lets me think instead of having that,0.09448227
well you know while i love you know going out to eat or going to a movie or hanging out in a park or something like that with other people,0.19123809
you know,0.07163658
it's a different experience on how you interpret your thoughts,0.061891794
or what you might want to do,0.057787
so i i like that this allowed her to introduce a feeling of longing in her and that you know a feeling that she wouldn't or may not have felt otherwise if she was accompanied by mariana um at one point and i think it signifies uh you know it just an igniting of passion,0.13899767
but mariana's looking at the previous portrait of eloise and with the the smudged face and she has the you know it's all done by candlelight and she's you know looking at this portrait and you know right when she gets around to the area of the heart the portrait catches fire and mariana just sort of steps back and watches it happen until later it's you know transferred to the the fireplace to to finish burning and i think that it's both you know a symbol of igniting passion uh in heloise and the the significance of the burning of the the complete portrait is a way to start over and start fresh,0.09311442
so it's it's not so much as you know that she was trying to destroy something as the the director was trying to you know symbolize the future passion,0.14387476
and starting anew uh also in the film uh there are moments where uh marianne uh she sees a ghost uh like a ghost image of heloise uh in what i i you know it kind of symbolized,0.08092745
it looked like a like a nightgown but also a wedding dress,0.15209858
so it seems like,0.059277255
there's also a growing passion in her and that she's being haunted by that and the the the semblance and of just like her feelings of you know what's going to happen like what's going to come and to take whatever you know time,0.15035293
she can uh you know because she's just being haunted by what's going to be uh beyond that,0.1707578
there's while they're let me backtrack a second,0.065855235
the portrait that does by memory uh gets destroyed she looks the the portrait with eloise and realizes that um,0.15469795
it's not her like i mean,0.21548551
it's her but it's not her um,0.17694351
so they destroy the photo the mother gets upset and heloise decides to sit for the the portrait which you know baffles her mother,0.3638803
so her mother allows her to allows mariana to stay around and complete the portrait as eloise is sitting in for it,0.15217961
while they're they're making the the portrait,0.07872108
uh mariana is looking at elise and like describing how she needs to pose or you know about her smile or just little bitty actions um that that she's doing describing those actions uh eloise at one point in time tells her to stop stop what she's doing and to come over to her um sort of like it,0.35644403
it feels like an order like stop what you're doing come here like we're gonna talk and it ends up being like a like i'm gonna turn the the table on you like look at you know the the direction i'm seeing you from and then she starts describing little nuances like mariana described of her and you you sort of see this like passion building um,0.31765586
you know i feel like if this was an american film they would have you know started passionately making love or whatever that given scene but what i liked about this is that it allowed that passion to build and grow,0.15534507
which you see later and done in private and i i really like that so you know in this moment you see that she's sort of like they're both describing just little things that people notice about you that you don't necessarily notice about yourself and just you know little pleasantries and little nuances like the way you know your eyes you know when you're intrigued about something you're you know your eyebrows rise or when you're upset you you know your mouth sort of drops and you don't know what to do,0.39182538
and so just little things like that,0.06261762
and i think it adds to the story and the the overall growth of the passion that you see later there's a moment when they're all reading it's uh louise mariana and sophie,0.059982028
they're all sitting around a table reading orpheus and eurodice and that they start breaking down,0.12365529
this moment of the story when when orpheus is the they're having an impassioned conversation uh the these two characters uh the the book is based off and eurodace is that they're discussing,0.07177229
uh a love between the two of them,0.0967357
and as uh uh orpheus leaves uh your eurodice tells him to turn around,0.24338114
and so he turns around and then leaves instead of like it's sort of uh like a a way to describe the that this character and which when i got to this part of the the film you see it kind of open up and and things start to make more sense,0.07047201
and the things that i thought earlier in the film when they were sitting at the beach and uh the idea of the portrait and the ranged marriage everything like that um,0.06588296
and why the portrait wasn't wanting to be done is you start to see in this book,0.08335739
and then the film continues and follows after this uh sort of kind of like a midway point and you know it it's showing you that you can either have the choice of the poet and you leave you know only retaining,0.06546783
the memory of what you had rather than you know the choice of the lover and taking the moment for what it is staying around and you know either,0.0652285
it goes on and you live a great and wonderful life,0.15069957
or it doesn't and you know it buds out and it just is what it is so in in this the it pretty much encapsulizes the rest of the film so there's a love story these two uh heloise and mariana they they fall in love um and they realized that that love can't be after the portrait is completed and that marianne she chooses to walk away like orpheus did,0.08653018
and you know she chose to take the poet's way out and just have that last memory of happiness rather than what could have come from their relationship,0.057344608
uh especially in the world and at that time uh who knows how that could have turned out ended up so the sort of gather everything uh you know that they fall in love it's your you know,0.12351626
it's the story,0.04360061
how you see it unfold throughout the film,0.0521049
uh you know there's no,0.09929591
i don't think there are any real surprises necessarily uh i i think that the film writes itself out as it should,0.08214048
and as it's supposed to uh a couple of things in the film i did notice is uh there's a scene which involves sophie uh she finds out that she's pregnant and i suppose at the the time that this film is set around if she were found to be you know an unwed mother,0.15110955
she may have lost her job what you know what have you and been on her own to to try and find out what she needs to do to to keep going um she winds up going to a local woman and she gets an abortion,0.4680059
uh there's a very sad and unique juxtaposition during the scene um you see it all unfold and take place,0.065785654
you know she comes in the lady lays her down and performs the abortion as it's happening there's a baby next to her the the woman's child is next to her on the bed and you see this sort of connection and like she doesn't want to have this abortion,0.42427054
but because of what she's presented with she has no choice,0.1798978
and so you see it's like she's face to face with what she's lost,0.53490317
and you see like a a breakdown of her soul and you know it's it's a very intimate moment um hello east and mariana,0.26034486
they're there uh hello east makes you know marion is trying to to look away,0.15399657
and she's like watch what's happening,0.10051886
you know,0.07163658
it's you,0.09746109
you have to understand that your choices have actions and you know they may not all be the best,0.14817464
so you know that this is the outcome of the action she chose to take but it's it's just a very like you get into that scene,0.14235991
and especially when it you know pans in on her and the baby and you know she's crying just seeing everything it,0.43156597
i mean it it sort of breaks you down in that scene and it's just a very beautiful scene,0.31089434
there's uh another scene where he'll release and mariana are you know,0.09690515
it's their last moments together,0.08530625
and uh mariana that she's drawing a portrait of heloise and they discussed like oh you can you know you'll always have,0.1089039
my memory you'll be able to recreate this portrait a thousand times over just from memory,0.16629812
and then she discusses a you know would you draw something from me and hands her a book and chooses a page in that book and mariana,0.14779048
she draws a self-portrait of her for hallease,0.620607
you know it's just as a a lasting memory,0.15313639
you know something that she can look back to and remember,0.095319904
and then you know that the mother comes everyone gets dressed goes about their separate ways,0.14478913
and then you you have the the final goodbye where marianna,0.07758907
she gets paid for you know performing her duty and completing the portrait uh it's her time to leave i mean she obviously can't stick around and she has her final rounds of goodbyes and then she goes,0.24012575
there's that final moment where like in the book hello east runs down the stairs to stop mariana from leaving and she's like turn around and you know has that whole moment just like in the book um almost verbatim and mariana leaves you know it cuts out next thing,0.055990033
you know um miranda's an art show and she's showing off,0.19097239
uh some of the art that she has done uh under her father's name uh i you know i guess as a woman back then you you wouldn't have been able to you know put out your own art in some cases so she put it under her father's name so it would get recognized,0.23383859
and if anyone asked she would explain that it was her piece while she's there,0.1307207
this is many years later while she's there,0.07878753
she sees a portrait on the wall not her portrait but a portrait of eloise with a daughter so you have that she sees it and all these emotions come flooding back come flooding through and she sees that louise is holding a book,0.1554193
and it's her finger is holding the book at the page you see the page number that she's holding it to,0.19037972
and it's the page that she drew that portrait on so it was kind of like a you know this portrait's going to get out and i want you know if there's any chance that marianna is going to see this that i want her to know that i still think about her and so like i thought that was just kind of like a beautiful nod and she saw it and she was like you know just reassured that what they had was what she remembers,0.19114347
and i i love that and then lastly the end of this movie it like it sucks you in it's you know,0.7451441
it's the last like 30 seconds to a minute,0.12024252
but it like sucks you in and earlier in the film there's a scene where uh the two of them are sitting at you know she's trying to explain eloise asks mariana what orchestra music's like and she can't really explain it but she tries there's a heart support in the room and she plays this favorite tune of hers a vivaldi tune uh and you know just kind of talks about the the piece while she's playing it for her and trying to describe you know what what an orchestra is like to someone who's never heard one and you know doing her best at the the this film ends with uh mariana attending an orchestra show and she sees from afar um she's she's alone mind you um which kind of uh harks back to earlier in the film with the idea of solitude and doing something just for yourself and so she's there and she sees off like she notices in the distance a woman walking and it's heloise she's there by herself doing this in solitude,0.4472923
and what i loved about this is she notices it and and you get the the commentary describing her entering the you know tour seat in the theater on the balcony like you you see all this going on and it you like you no longer,0.13677406
you're at this point seeing through the eyes of mariana,0.117844805
and as she's looking across at eloise the the production starts and it zooms in closer and closer and closer to eloise and you think and this is a another thing,0.08332115
i like this i i feel like if this movie was made in america you would have had her like look over and like there'd be a like an obvious you know connection of sight,0.16194347
and the movie would have just ended the last 30 seconds of this film is the music starts,0.09418103
it's the vivaldi song that she was showing her earlier in the film and you just see it zoom in closer and closer slower and slower to heloise and you see that like all this emotion,0.10214894
she realizes what song is she it's all this emotions flooding back in,0.13733463
and you see her like breathing heavier breathing heavier,0.44079047
she's realizing like it's it's that poet moment where she goes back to realizing what she had in the good time and you see her she starts to cry and the breathing just starts getting heavier and heavier and then the film ends,0.113559894
it's such a beautiful movie if i had to give this a star rating a solid five it's just in that last 30 seconds alone an amazing piece of film that that's definitely going into like,0.058988765
i love little nuances like that in film,0.24203037
and i feel like you only get like split seconds of it,0.31817085
but this you had 30 seconds of what was just honest true bold emotion and how somebody by themselves would react to something like this,0.10279546
so i mean definitely like five stars a solid five star,0.072198905
this is a beautiful movie,0.073938176
and i do want to watch it again soon and just just really take the film in um that there's a scene in the film uh i'm gonna put the the song,0.06576731
the link for this song below um,0.1856937
but there's a scene where they go back or they they go out to when sophie's trying to get you know find out about her pregnancy,0.112625815
they go to this,0.077987775
they're they're it's like a,0.080941655
i wouldn't say a party but a gathering in a field there's a fire there,0.14684026
and there's a song that starts up just uh like a an acapella like a group acapella and you know just clapping percussions and you know i'm gonna put the song below but it was it's a beautiful moment in the film um just the the song is it's it's i wouldn't i don't want to call it haunting,0.10353481
but it's i mean it's a beautiful like composition with everyone together everyone joining in and just having that moment um definitely check this film out if you've seen it uh throw down in the comments below something that stood out to you um if you liked it or not,0.11529807
