oh okay hey hey what did what a couple of dates right dodging spoilers going,0.095571764
completely Internet gone not streaming at all so don't get any spoilers of anything keeping,0.16237791
radio silence I I saw it at midnight I left the theater at 3:30 got,0.093453325
home at like 4:00 little earlier than four I'm I had nothing but Raisinets and,0.11222094
coffee for the past like 12 hours I'm my face is red I'm breaking out,0.116302416
I'm sweaty everything is going crazy I'm trying to catch up on work that I've,0.29099575
messed up on and and everything is insane but we're here to discuss a review,0.17762569
for Avengers endgame I don't do movie reviews at all so if you're new here,0.097769484
hi I'm Berkey I don't do these but they're fun sometimes so I occasionally do,0.16226432
them but we are just going here to discuss Avengers endgame because of course we,0.0546834
are because of course I gotta get that YouTube money but of course I want,0.10529916
to talk about it I did a review for infinity war back in the day,0.100670725
as well and so I thought be a very interesting thing to go ahead and,0.053978935
talk about this particular movie because it's a big deal and unfortunately reviewing the movie,0.10359888
is hard as hell because the trailer showed maybe the first quarter of the film,0.25976038
and they showed you basically nothing and it has it's just not it's nothing they,0.08968982
shown you pretty much nothing and the trailers are fantastic they do a great job,0.14530642
at setting up the movie and setting up what you think you'll be getting into,0.08550889
when in reality there is so much more going on and it's pretty fantastic when,0.05763235
you actually do see it now what do I think in the movie it's great,0.104455024
it's phenomenal actually it is incredible it is in my opinion not as good as,0.14543056
infinity war however it has a lot of parts that are better than infinity war,0.21034008
and that's hard to entirely describe without going into spoilers which I will not be,0.092650376
going into today and it's difficult to really provide a good reason or discussion of,0.04667539
why I think part of it is really really good and better than infinity war,0.21659008
but as a movie I would probably consider it just slightly lower like if you,0.12230937
had a top-five list of Marvel movies if any war beer they're an endgame would,0.19525632
be right below it but overall it is a pretty phenomenal movie it is long,0.101162165
movie three hours long and there are no good bathroom breaks so just don't drink,0.07471357
water at all ever in that entire day dehydrate yourself I don't know just there,0.11464242
are no good time solely by the bathroom the three hours fly by I understand,0.09535884
three hours this is like interstellar length of a movie so it flies by but,0.13770005
it is still very long and it split up into three acts like most things,0.10130253
are and the first act that I could name each acts in their own ways,0.1491117
the first act is depression and sadness the second act is comedy and fanservice and,0.12898949
the third act is spectacle the first act is actually probably my favourite act it,0.10174393
deals a lot with what happens when Thanos does his snap what happens when half,0.124082975
the population is eradicated and how these Avengers and people are trying to survive afterwards,0.31016538
because it hurts it hurts pretty bad and these are all actors that are incredibly,0.2918927
good we kind of forget that the people who play these roles are very talented,0.046108507
actors and actresses Robert Downey jr. Jeremy Renner Paul Rudd skal Johansen etc these are,0.1243542
good actors you know I mean they may not always be in good films but,0.1480729
they can act em it's nice to have them finally acting finally showing pain and,0.2591356
and sadness and depression and it is extremely good in particular there is a lot,0.0846832
of Hawkeye and ant-man in this movie and they are actually pretty damn good Scott,0.46023747
Lang and Liz it was a Clint Barton last name Paul Rudd and Jeremy Renner,0.15151913
they do a great job in their respective roles they have a lot of screen,0.07752063
time and especially Hawkeye has a very good amount of time and he really has,0.07798222
a nicely developed character I thoroughly enjoyed him this movie focuses a lot more around,0.06279023
the six main Avengers so that's Iron Man's Hulk Thor Captain America Black Widow Hawkeye,0.057150804
and it does actually do a little bit of ant-man as well like I just,0.15074904
mentioned but those here main main ingredient players personally captain America is my favorite Avenger,0.046743304
and he has been ever since Civil War actually no no no Winter Soldier because,0.09146244
he seems like he went through a lot of arcs the first Captain America movie,0.08233329
it was pretty good but it wasn't anything overly fantastic and his character wasn't overly,0.1495618
interesting it was just I am small and weak and now I am big and,0.14654686
strong but his morals and his own personal personality didn't really change civil erb when,0.13111986
a soldier really kind of put the screws to that Civil War put the screws,0.241446
to it even more and now I think he's a really well fleshed out character,0.15080518
and he got a decent amount of screen time he's actually very important in this,0.076180026
movie primarily Robert Downey jr. and Chris Evans so Iron Man Captain America do a,0.060905784
pretty phenomenal job in their in their retrospective areas em days do the show sometimes,0.09971693
and it becomes pretty damn fantastic going over to the second act it's a lot,0.33127338
more fanservice see is it too fanservice see maybe I don't know on a first,0.10784565
viewing I loved the hell out of it it was great both in terms of,0.19570656
emotional punches comedic punches and just fanservice in general however I do wonder if I'll,0.15887873
get tired of it on subsequent viewings I'll have to see it again in order,0.0982017
to legitimately think about that but the second act is actually my personal opinion the,0.080710605
weakest of the three acts not because it's bad but because of some pacing issues,0.17490086
it's a little bit - alright we're doing this and then we're doing this and,0.10132094
then these people are doing this these people are doing this then but but they're,0.06635677
doing this also and we gotta be careful cuz these guys are doing this and,0.055383302
we gotta cut back because we gotta save on time and it's still a three-hour,0.07601694
long movie you could probably make the entire film or you could make an entire,0.109993905
film we're on the second act and happen to be a full-fledged movie I think,0.093676664
the pacing was a little bit difficult there but it was still pretty sob and,0.122670524
the third act is just it's it's just insane it's it's ridiculous it is an,0.60494506
absolute spectacle it is fantastic crazy looking and I can't really describe it in any,0.22780493
way because anything that I could describe it with will be a spoiler and is,0.072755076
just too too crazy I can't say anything about it the third act is immense,0.34893072
one of the most impressive third acts of any movie I've ever seen it is,0.054877717
the culmination of 10 years of filmmaking 10 years of Marvel BAM right into the,0.09728496
last 45 minutes and it is pretty incredible it is it's undescribable I can't really,0.05961473
talk about it without you actually going out and seeing it or spoiling it so,0.15604924
I am just saying it's great it does have some downsides at least part I,0.0755778
mean throughout the full movie not the 3rd act in primarily but overall the movie,0.078924365
is phenomenal it is a very good final movie it is a great kind of,0.067230895
farewell to the first 10 years there's obviously gonna be more Marvel movies but it,0.097604
is a solid end piece and game haha jokes jokes I'm just so funny but,0.064046346
sorry sorry yeah it's a great 10 it's a great 10-year send-off and overall some,0.10397039
pacing issues I have also you can nitpick the out of this movie it's just,0.102461554
a warning if you're like kind of people that really care about specifics and and,0.21500343
certain continuity and wait if they did this in this movie how are they doing,0.07587488
this in endgame and how why don't they just do this and that you can,0.115776055
you'll do that and if you're that kind of person you will do that a,0.110446215
lot there are a lot of issues like that I can name a loft out,0.06222397
of my head and if that's the kind of thing that really bugs you like,0.4375211
this does this and I hate this because this was supposed to be this in,0.31089434
that movie then okay valid criticisms valid criticisms and I completely see that but expectations,0.076698095
are important in a movie and I'll say this like I said before in games,0.08122731
I don't play Uncharted and I don't expect Uncharted to be God of War and,0.24062736
I don't play papers please and expect it to be Metal Gear Rising you need,0.07081227
to know what you're getting into you're getting into a big spectacle comic book movie,0.26688012
yeah there are coincidences yeah there are easy things that work with the plot and,0.07266681
yeah there are plot points that are there just to do this thing of course,0.08173854
there are it's a Marvel movie this is what you're getting you can nitpick the,0.14133754
out of this movie but the movie almost kind of knows this it almost knows,0.07828593
that you can nitpick it and so it just doesn't care and at the end,0.10477078
of the day I'm kind of okay with that because knowing what the movie is,0.062571794
is more important than trying to fix all of it kind of like gari is,0.07373819
the galaxy right it's dumb and it's fun and it's silly and it knows it,0.67287755
is and because of that is a better movie because of at the end so,0.059891522
that's my review phenomenal not the best Marvel movie ever but absolutely great a fantastic,0.13924238
send-off some really great emotional beats big fan absolutely go see if you haven't been,0.18490867
spoiled yet or you haven't seen already tomorrow have any spoiler review as well if,0.16668008
you want to talk more about the nitty gritty go ahead and check that up,0.09067749
