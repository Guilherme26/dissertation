hey it's open social thoughts today we're going to be talking about patty Jenkins's Wonder,0.019368153
Woman starring gal gadot let me just say right off the bat that Wonder Woman,0.235301
is not only the best DC film ever made but it's just a plain great,0.07570721
superhero movie and this is the first-ever first-ever Wonder Woman film the film really is,0.010355579
an origin story so before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana Princess of the,0.0329073
Amazon a trained warrior when a pilot crashes on her Island and tells her about,0.020534884
the war that's going on outside she feels like she needs to go out there,0.106485255
and help end this war to end all wars and out there she discovers her,0.17367879
true powers and her true destiny despite this film being a superhero movie it feels,0.05291536
very different from any other films we've seen there seems to be a lot more,0.031583585
hope compassion and humanity in this film and maybe that's because of our leading lady,0.1189089
Diana who comes into this world with abundance of love and hope only to realize,0.10143984
that the world is way more harsh than she initially realizes one of the most,0.07224227
powerful aspects of this film is that it shows you the casualties of war in,0.04873335
a brutally honest way without sugarcoating anything and really showing you the trauma behind it,0.22418448
like Captain America Wonder Woman is very idealistic she wants to save everyone and although,0.055870105
she comes off as a bit naive I think her biggest lesson that she learns,0.30386624
is that the world isn't so black and white and that everybody is fighting their,0.08250539
own battle and I think that message was one of the most unique aspects of,0.015276608
the film because as a superhero and you want you want to save everybody and,0.026139056
you can't and I think it's that inner turmoil but also facing that reality that,0.050168816
is very true and very real with its slow-mo action shots perfect comedic timing and,0.06156341
powerful message Wonder Woman delivers on all levels gal gadot is so dang beautiful every,0.099400386
shot she was in I was like holy crap girl she literally woke up like,0.7470538
the wrong thing so but who knows I loved her as Wonder Woman and I,0.04581253
can't wait to see what she does next in this second Hill she brings up,0.052914027
like a very powerful presence but also she's very vulnerable and I think that combination,0.050134227
very inspiring to see on screen because at times I feel like female characters can,0.03290996
only be very one-dimensional and I want to see it all I want and she,0.0776715
really brings it she is this powerful Amazon warrior and at the same time she,0.033500645
feels very conflicted and she is able to balance these two emotions very well and,0.021661706
I think that that one that's what me that is what makes her so heroic,0.04996793
and just plain beautiful I loved the character and I know I was kind of,0.04331277
bashing on Chris Pine for being and everything film and all my god and when,0.22321296
you see somebody else but he was really great in this and he was very,0.025545048
heroic in his own way and he brought he was a very good counterpart to,0.049842875
gal gadot's Wonder Woman they worked very well together and everything seemed not so natural,0.11552444
it wasn't forced and there are so many key moments so I was like wow,0.021335766
I would have never thought they would ever put this in a in a superhero,0.08025374
film especially when they just casually talked to get to know each other that was,0.017373266
one of the best things about this film and another one of the highlights for,0.02327411
me was the other cast Robin Wright at anti obey ng Opie Davis stoolies to,0.120345026
loose as Ares Harry Potter character coming back in Wonder Woman and he was so,0.024108252
powerful and then Eleanor anayia who was in all MOBA doors face as dr. Poisson,0.035387106
she was magnificent I wanted more of her she seemed so evil and yet like,0.2888395
such a real person and I think that that's what patty Jenkins did so well,0.099455595
in this film and they made all these villains and even good people real people,0.16104163
not just caricatures like I'm a villain and I I really appreciated that and we,0.049540218
these people exist somewhere out there and they're not just flat they embody so many,0.1506754
dimensions and body so many emotions and I loved I loved to not I don't,0.106647566
know about you but finally seeing a female superhero starring in their own film almost,0.06766647
seems so normal to me I know it's not but it did seem normal and,0.044467527
yet I understand how big of a deal this is and knowing that it was,0.021055723
such a proud and monumental moment to finally see this on the big screen I,0.030017743
know that there were parts I got teary-eyed especially when she enters no-man's land it's,0.10657572
such a powerful historic symbolic moment for not just the film itself and the story,0.014076617
behind it but for everybody else that's watching it it is very emotional and it's,0.0290499
one of the most iconic moments in the film that I I really just I,0.022279661
felt so again proud despite knowing that oh my god wonder what are you doing,0.015987024
don't go out there like it's no man's land and just the fact that she,0.0580559
did was incredibly inspiring I man I appreciated this film so much and sometimes it,0.044693023
kind of went into a cheesy territory with this message of hope and love but,0.05233199
honestly it's the kind of message we really need right now it's that cheesiness like,0.07402829
we need to up that cheesy factor because the world is not that great at,0.06706847
this moment and it's people like her a superhero like Wonder Woman who believes in,0.070950486
this cause so much about love and it's unlike any other superhero I've seen because,0.039728094
a lot of the superheroes we've seen are pretty jaded and for once we see,0.02053688
a person who is very sure of themselves despite all the that's going on around,0.031065406
them despite the war that she's in she's she feels OK and confident to be,0.09399244
like we can change this with love hope and all this great message I'm like,0.053647727
oh my god yes we can't we can't change it it just takes a lot,0.037723895
of face and a lot of man power or female woman power mine I say,0.16865133
let's replace that and yeah let me know what you guys thought of the silve,0.03950326
is and I absolutely loved it I can't wait to watch the sequel I know,0.06675118
it's domestically it surpassed 100 million dollars in the box office making it the most,0.022742629
gross film for any female director which honestly i Junkins did an incredible job I,0.2824098
also would like to see more fight scenes next time around and I just want,0.09641904
to see bigger better villains come to life yeah I have so much to say,0.11380295
but I think I said all that I can right now I have been a,0.014530937
big fan of Wonder Woman for a while and it's just such a pleasure to,0.07087132
finally see her in the big screen anyway thank you so much for tuning in,0.038990404
