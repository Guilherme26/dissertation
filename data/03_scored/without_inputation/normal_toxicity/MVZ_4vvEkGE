hey everyone welcome back to my channel I'm Stef Koza and I have not posted a video in a while so hello hi still alive,0.18738927
it's summer it's time for vacations and traveling and not sitting in this room all the time but summertime also means an incredible amount of summer blockbusters,0.05686845
so here we are about to review one Mission Impossible,0.04415825
fallout let's go,0.08605877
so this is one of those movies where you see the trailer and you're like do,0.083516985
we need another Mission Impossible movie not really but after seeing it I feel like I needed it,0.055861887
I had so much fun watching Mission Impossible fall out what I feel like the first thing that needs to be addressed here is Tom Cruise 56 years old six the Mission Impossible film really action-packed like heavy load of like stunts and practical effects and like difficult for a 56 year old man to be doing,0.08470122
so a lot of people were like can,0.07437432
he still do this like is this is this gonna be okay or is this gonna be like some weird crickety old frail man trying to like embrace his younger self that he just can't find anymore,0.24100561
but if you told me that this man was 56 years old I would not believe you just what he is just as incredible,0.17747715
if not more incredible then he's always been in all,0.10438733
the Mission Impossible films,0.07799241
I don't really like Tom Cruise like nobody really likes Tom Cruise like let's be real he's kind of a prick sorry Tom but I am so impressed by him like he does 99% of his own stunts he wants them all to be practical,0.53490317
he doesn't like green screen,0.14875211
so he will literally be hanging off the helicopter doing some ridiculous stunts just because he wants to because he cares about the movie,0.62997216
and he's like this is what it has to be like I just I have to do this sorry and it's so cool and it really shows in the movies you can tell like this was a real stunt this this happened in real life,0.10105796
and I really do appreciate the hell out of that because not a lot of people do that especially in this day and age he's badass enough at 56 years old to be hanging off helicopters and climbing rocks and skydiving,0.69542736
I can't even do that now 25 so mission impossible fallout is directed by the same drew after that did the previous Mission Impossible movie this is like a direct sequel to the events that happened there,0.053642668
it's like the same characters the same villain,0.2001913
so they're very closely related,0.06718873
and this movie is also very much like pretty much,0.07133339
what you would expect we know the format,0.0672763
the formula of a Mission Impossible movie at this point,0.0735752
there's some exposition it's like okay,0.09489051
now we get it,0.056313466
and then once you get it,0.0909086
it's just a whirlwind of action sequences,0.26593646
and just ridiculous like there's hardly any lines in like the second and third acts,0.71193427
it's just ridiculous amounts of incredible action,0.4354315
but that's what we signed up for when we go see Mission Impossible,0.053656895
well you know that's what we're getting into,0.061361395
I would describe this movie like a roller coaster kind of ebbs and flows there are lots of like really high intensity moments and then really low kind of boring exposition moments,0.15545194
but like the overarching plot of the movie like the whole experience,0.085789934
it's kind of like when you're going up a rollercoaster hill and it's like the really big hill and you're just like slowly like working your way up and it's just like and you have like this anticipation building but it's really slow and you're just kind of looking around and you're like,0.24142423
oh I can see my car from here,0.07221413
and then you finally get to the top and she's like,0.08090278
and that's the rest of the first act up the hill rest of the movie crazy rollercoaster and it's really fun like I did not expect to have that much fun in this movie I had so much fun like I'd have to point out this is a three hour movie this movie was three hours long,0.18242745
there was not one moment where I realized it was three hours long like I walked out of the theater,0.0631336
and I said holy it's 11 o'clock,0.17084931
how did this happen,0.07036687
but it was like really it was just so fun and so exciting and so many new things kept happening as I cool,0.045893453
ooh ooh what and it was just very exciting,0.052288514
I will say the villains villain villains were not super interesting I think some of that has to do with the fact that the villain why does my microphone always die,0.3503512
every time,0.07809457
every time,0.07809457
hey whilst I never make a video without her microphone dying halfway through,0.44736245
we'll never know anyways,0.08429811
what was I talking about,0.06309824
what was I saying villains,0.1520407
I think the villain in this movie is Lane who was established in the previous movie,0.09715549
so there wasn't really any like we don't need to know much more about him,0.099069715
we kind of already know but that made it a little bit boring because like he doesn't really say much of anything throughout the entire movie he's just sort of there,0.16718492
he's just kind of a problem,0.30138412
and it's just more about them solving this mission and solving,0.067617804
this problem that he has created but he's not really doing anything,0.13141479
after he's created the problem,0.11434076
if that makes sense so the the real villain of this movie is just like the mission that they're trying to solve,0.11391939
and then there are obviously like some people who get in the way and like try and stop them from solving,0.1523282
this mission because you have to have a million car chases and fight scenes and all that good stuff,0.13737841
but I don't think any of it is like strongly motivated by anything,0.092709005
and that was one flaw that the movie had was just kind of like face value,0.15073006
it's a mission they need to solve it save the people run from the bad guys very top-level average action movie stuff,0.15932201
but like I said this movie does have some incredible plot twists that I never would have thought of there were,0.07887296
so many things that happened that I did not see coming at all,0.06587939
and every time,0.0689868
they happened,0.054424755
I was just like oh like everyone in the theater just starts screaming,0.11283432
they're just like what's happening like really well-written ideas and concepts,0.24045283
and there's a lot of like sticky situations that they get into and you're like I literally could not even think of a way to get out of this like the writing is surprisingly impressive,0.24530111
I think the dialogue is not very good,0.14526841
there are a lot of like kind of cheesy moments,0.1510374
but I think that's sort of part of the charm of Mission Impossible is it's like,0.040237453
it's a shitty action movie that's actually not that shitty,0.9003433
it's like one of those blockbusters,0.1312985
that's like a pretty good blockbuster like I would definitely watch it again,0.09965547
it was really fun,0.051686145
Ethan Hunt is still a really believable character even with Tom Cruise being 56 years old like he really convinces you that he can do all of these things,0.08039277
you just kind of love him like I started the movie,0.14725788
and I was a guy I forgot how much I hate Tom Cruise but then I got like halfway through the movie knows like I love,0.29742944
you you're so great you're such a good character,0.07161397
it's just so cool,0.055663053
and I mean there are a lot of moments in this movie where you're like that would never happen,0.24009492
that's just ridiculous like,0.7304321
it's a little bit believable like everything kind of like you could defend it with physics it's just kind of like in an anomaly situation but like it could happen,0.19235896
it's just very unlikely that all of these things happen to this guy and like he was okay but that's kind of the excitement of it's kind of funny like whenever something like that happened like everyone in my theater would just laugh like you know it's not a moment in the movie where you're supposed to laugh,0.15353586
but it's just so ridiculous that you can't help it and it was just made it kind of more fun,0.6859307
some people might consider that a flaw,0.17977141
I consider it a charm,0.09322858
I think Henry cavils character was a little bit he had some good moments,0.09325858
but in general not super interesting probably could have done without him,0.099962436
I mean he was crucial to a few plot points,0.10734902
so I get it,0.07052164
I don't know I wasn't really blown away by his presence,0.24257505
I think Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames really stole the show I love the two of them together Rebecca Ferguson was also a super badass,0.33528253
I just love to see a girl kicking ass just as hard as the rest of the cast like yours are so invigorating to watch her work,0.92186195
but yeah in general I thoroughly enjoyed this movie way more than I thought I would it's a three hour movie that doesn't feel like three hours,0.06721763
and I would say mission impossible,0.0687456
fallout is the best action movie this year so far,0.043801915
but that's just because we don't have John wick yet zing I'm so excited,0.11056514
okay,0.050967902
yes mission impossible fallout,0.09994027
I'm gonna give it a four a four out of five surprisingly good really just came out of left field,0.111457296
I wasn't even excited to see it,0.13492501
I was like I have to go see Mission Impossible,0.054575812
but I loved it I had so much fun,0.060630623
if you're a fan of Mission Impossible you're a fan of action movies you have to see this movie you will love it,0.1518939
I guarantee it,0.05777714
but that's it for this review,0.07094765
