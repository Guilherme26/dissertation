what is going on Star Wars Episode eight the last Jedi,0.056047514
I can't even believe I'm saying these words,0.149339
I can't even believe I'm already reviewing this movie but this was most definitely my most anticipated movie of 2017 because I loved the force awakens it was my favorite movie of 2015,0.08684732
I know that all of people have problems with that movie,0.17855337
I absolutely adored it it is one of the best movie going experiences I've ever had in my life and I let me just stayed with me I just love it,0.12730893
so of course I was pumped out of my mind to see this more I'm so glad I'm excited,0.17250997
I actually haven't watched any of the latest trailers,0.068187796
I only seen the first teaser trailer and then that comic-con featurette behind the scenes thingy but other than that I stayed away from other trailers,0.07957771
and I actually did not know what to expect from it,0.09810996
and what I got was a very different and mature and metaphorical Star Wars film that isn't just a fantastic Star Wars movie it is a great and powerful film itself that a movie lovers can see and just be amazed by incredible direction by incredible filmmaking the visuals in this movie are out of this world,0.050116386
literally it is just such a beautiful looking movie the CGI the set design everything the musical score by John Williams just everything in this movie looks on point and most importantly what this movie does in regards to the story it just builds upon,0.057286214
this character so much more it is a similar thing,0.08316785
what Empire Strikes Back did,0.06962316
because the first Star Wars movie was a very entertaining adventure film it was very fast paced,0.074179426
it was very enjoyable,0.07973171
just like the force awakens but then Empire Strikes Back built upon those characters it was much darker the movie went down,0.09195117
some roads that a lot of people probably did not expect just like the last Jedi there were things in this movie that surprised me so much there were some moments where I was like okay that is very weird,0.104709916
for a Star Wars movie,0.05568309
I do not actually know how some of the fans will react that in fact I don't actually know how to feel about that at the moment,0.06671687
but then when you let some of the things sink in and you're like oh my god,0.12463524
there's just a completely different meaning to it,0.029780755
there is a lot of deeper thoughts that went into developing this screenplay and just everything comes together so beautifully towards the ending of the movie there were just some things,0.08169455
when you are maybe not all that sure about,0.11577667
but then towards the ending certain things are revealed,0.053030167
now this actually puts all the other things in the different perspective this might just place with you it is a brilliant screenplay by Rian Johnson,0.061587323
and also the directing by him it is just like,0.07164018
I said such a beautiful movie certain shots in this one were so not traditional Star Wars but they had place in this movie because they just felt right there were just some shots which were beautiful the editing everything it isn't as fast-paced of a movie as the force awakens was but there's just so much more beneath the surface in regards to the story in regards to the characters Daisy Ridley as rain,0.09211076
this movie is fantastic,0.12293974
her character it just built upon so mother's a lot of conflict in certain characters and you are just there to experience all of that it is just such a beautiful movie to watch and experience it for yourself through the eyes of those characters,0.15389858
and also I really like just like in the force awakens Adam driver as kylo Ren that character I just loved and loved and loved more I really loved him in the force awakens and in the last year he's even better his character is also very built upon from the previous movie,0.05647167
and let's just talk about Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker just great fantastic,0.07774559
I really liked how they portrayed this character in this movie Carrie Fisher rest in peace,0.10248575
Carrie Fisher,0.029161531
her character was also really strong in this movie John boyega as Finn also had to do in this movie and certain things that happen with his character were also very strong and powerful and just almost every single character in this movie is so much more than they were in the previous one there were also some newcomers like Benicio del Toro and Laura Dern I also thought that those characters had a lot of things to go for that were very strong at the same time,0.078042366
bb-8 is just awesome,0.043813553
I just love bb-8 and also the humor in this movie I was very surprised but overall as a movie it is a much darker film from the force awakens,0.06408015
I know that a lot of people compared the force awakens to a new hope there were a lot of similarities between those movies yes and other people are also scared that this movie will be much too similar to Empire Strikes Back,0.098927796
there are similarities to that movie but this is such a original Star Wars film there were some moments where I was just blown away I just could not believe what I was seeing there,0.04730666
were just some metaphorical scenes and things were happening,0.06577774
and I was like okay,0.07658915
what the hell does that mean,0.71392614
now I absolutely adored the last Jedi it isn't as fast-paced as the force awakens but it basically builds upon,0.07334099
what that movie did so much more,0.09231252
and it is just such a powerful film certain things that go down towards the ending like in the third act the third act in this movie is so goddamn awesome,0.6347782
it is so suspenseful I had so much fun with this movie it is truly an awesome Star Wars film but it is also much more than that it is also a very powerful film with emotions with great filmmaking,0.06088293
it just looks so beautiful it might be the best looking Star Wars film we've had so far,0.09603599
