of my viewers are interested in getting a film degree I'm gonna be having a,0.08731245
discussion about that at the end of this video when it comes to Thor Ragnarok,0.10121232
this film does for Thor what Captain America the Winter Soldier did for cap because,0.099534206
before Winter Soldier cap was cool and he was you know he's cool Captain America,0.115036905
but that movie was like oh my god Captain America is just incredible this film,0.18407412
is exactly what Thor needed he needed a major boost of fun and likability and,0.030868653
a great sense of freshness what's so great about Ragnarok is that it takes everything,0.093621954
we know everything that's been established about Thor and it dismantles it his hammer forget,0.09629585
about it it's gone his macho sense of right and wrong played for comedy but,0.17063946
it also keeps the heart of his character intact the family dynamics the struggle with,0.047379732
his brother and his father and now a new thing that he has to deal,0.12276909
with in hella played excellently by Kate Blanchet by the way everyone in this movie,0.14164954
steals the movie there was not one specific character that stole the film for me,0.24080151
because everyone was doing such a great job that they all stole the movie Tessa,0.24475776
Thompson Jeff Goldblum Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth even Taika Waititi as Korg they're all fantastic,0.09920841
this is one of my favorite Marvel movies this is everything I want to see,0.1828234
in a superhero movie it's extremely fun and likable when the action scenes are there,0.06659182
they're like adrenalin fuel they're extremely badass and beautifully shot this is a very colorful,0.36579058
movie which is something I was happy to see because the other Thor movies I'm,0.06475491
fine with them they're enjoyable you can watch them but they were easily some of,0.064206116
the weakest of all the MCU films this is without a doubt easily the best,0.11342049
of the Thor franchise and one of my favorite Marvel movies one of the biggest,0.12890248
issues that I had with the MC use treatment of Thor was that it seemed,0.061748914
I can't confirm this but it seemed like the creator's didn't think audiences would appreciate,0.037133135
such an obscure character unless they brought him quite literally down to earth and put,0.2624304
him in earth and gave him human friends on earth like Jane and Darcy these,0.11591065
are not the things I want to see in a Thor movie and you don't,0.10230105
have to have a strange godlike character around us in New York to be the,0.07117548
likable for us this movie understands that and it's an adventure movie he goes all,0.114662625
over the place and fights different beings of all different kinds but you care because,0.12868349
he feels like a person and it's because of great writing and great acting according,0.09668377
to Taika Waititi he has said that 80% of this movie was improvised that's astounding,0.118926086
because so much of it feels very well created and controlled in regards to the,0.059606303
humor it's so well timed and some might have an issue with this this is,0.06807457
an extremely funny movie and quite often rather than having a very serious moment it,0.08689489
will be played for a joke and that's one of the best things about this,0.10164778
film I believe this is the 17th MCU movie at some point this series is,0.054344922
going to have to acknowledge and be very self-aware of itself and make fun of,0.23974243
itself and Ragnarok does that something else I loved was that they actually have the,0.07794655
immigrant song in the movie it wasn't just for the trailer so often you hear,0.10031618
songs and trailers and you begin to attach that with your anticipation for the movie,0.0931223
and then it's nowhere to be heard in the movie I was so glad they,0.07569831
actually had it incorporated in some really badass moments in the film there were moments,0.14982055
of action here then where I got chills like it gave me goosebumps it was,0.1604567
so exciting you actually get to see Thor being the god of thunder not just,0.09373335
calling down some lightning bolts with his hammer they get rid of so many of,0.39374417
the things that we're used to seeing in a Thor movie that it became very,0.05424707
surprising consistently because you go to a Thor film at this point expecting to see,0.10769934
certain things you go to an MCU movie at this point expecting to see certain,0.07524196
things this film constantly sidestepped those expectations that we go into these types of movies,0.19174609
with to create a really fresh experience and that is due to excellent writing and,0.029618783
great directing and I have to give it the Taika Waititi because in fairly 80%,0.06267189
of this movie was improvised that's a lot of him going back and forth with,0.06722494
the actors creating something that's really cool it's just so rare that I find movies,0.087099254
where I'm consistently smiling I'm wrapped up in the movie and I'm forgetting that I'm,0.05258523
watching one because it's just so investing and just such a damn good time these,0.565584
movies aren't made as much as you would think often times you see a movie,0.114442326
like yeah that was kind of fun but it was just diverting this is a,0.093865894
movie that is so enjoyable to experience that I just forgot I was watching one,0.089804985
after a while and I was excited to see what would happen next and that's,0.100124285
one of the beauties of seeing a great film when you realize that you just,0.10970556
wrapped up in it and it's so rare it's so rare when you really think,0.15057448
about it that that happens and and ragnar√∂k did that for me I'm a huge,0.23496391
Planet Hulk fan it's easily my favorite of any of the Hulk comics so I,0.04537377
was really happy to see a lot of that incorporated into this movie quite more,0.06583418
of it than I expected which really brought a smile to my face so if,0.10410902
you are a fan of Planet Hulk like me you're gonna have a blast with,0.19469447
a lot here Jeff Goldblum as the Grand Master is everything I wanted I don't,0.08013578
care that he's basically being like the personification of our thoughts of who Jeff Goldblum,0.31089434
is that's fine with me I'll watch him go uh-huh yes like any day all,0.24062812
the time I don't care it's perfect as for issues with the movie yes there,0.0753957
are a lot of jokes and sometimes there may have been just a few too,0.06570749
many and it's not because there's too many jokes it's more about where to put,0.080298655
them and how to incorporate more serious scenes with the levity honestly 90% of time,0.18157764
it's flawless there were just a few times where I had laughed so much that,0.0917884
the humor came so much more and I was like okay I just laughed I,0.12904637
need give me a second to to process and that's really it's just like a,0.069944255
minor thing you know it's something you don't really care about it doesn't really affect,0.07964084
for me anyway the experience of this movie but I'm mentioning it because I thought,0.081805356
of it also hella well great I thought Blanchette was phenomenal sometimes her character can,0.13740698
be a real exposition Pease she will show art on the ceiling explaining her backstory,0.08790043
she'll be talking a lot to Carl Urban's character saying you don't notice about me,0.102083236
but this is kind of like what happened but she's really telling the audience because,0.089829765
her character comes with so much backstory and they really have to address a lot,0.07488061
of it but again honestly this isn't really anything that bothered me it's just something,0.09697043
that I feel like some people may notice from a screenwriting perspective these flaws are,0.06305226
so minimal that I just I had a blast this is a really fun movie,0.106177635
it's a great superhero movie easily the best Thor movie I'm gonna give thor ragnarok,0.07925867
and a definitely check this one out guys if you're a fan of the MCU,0.11207134
