this movie started up so well and crashed and burned right in front of my,0.4032809
face oh goodness so first offer after bad anyone who tells you that this movie,0.135308
was amazing was great um they're lying to you I was expecting this wouldn't be,0.24069346
good and it wasn't this is probably one of the worst Marvel Studios films that,0.24161725
I've seen I would probably give that award to to Thor Ragnarok but the redeeming,0.096048824
Grace about Thor Ragnarok is that you know add the millions of jokes they had,0.060198538
on display there were actually a couple that were funding that I kind of giggled,0.07159906
that this however has all the bad of thor ragnarok but without the humor there's,0.114483364
the I mean there's like bits and pieces of humor where they tried but it,0.13647763
was just like no it was a Miss so let's get into it that the,0.102491856
movie starts off amazing they tell the history of of will condign how the Black,0.29330495
Panther came to be and all the five tribes and everything I'm just like yo,0.090518996
this this is it was amazingly done I was like you know they managed to,0.09310341
wrap all that up in about a few seconds I was like this movies about,0.11315921
to be good Marvel Studios comes on so the movie starts off right it kind,0.12310002
of like in the middle of of Civil War where he hid where his father,0.09838765
dies and now he becomes king starts off with this scene the process of process,0.23981951
of how he becomes king and it's very much kind of like how it's done,0.089674145
in the jungle with the lines where you know if he had the headline and,0.06739005
if no one challenges the headline well he remains the headline if someone challenges him,0.073394924
and you know and he went well this guy's a new the new headline the,0.108007304
head of the head of the head of the the tribe or if he concedes,0.3213752
well then he remains the headline it's usually to the death based off the you,0.26518446
know the Discovery Channel so what happens is they ask all the tribes Bhiwandi you,0.15842234
know do we have a challenger to chawla everyone concedes no we don't have a,0.12375214
challenge no we don't have a challenger and one the other when the other tribes,0.13897179
are the mountain they have a challenger so they fight it out and T'Challa ends,0.116791196
up winning just by an inch by inch he wins and he becomes king now,0.15040149
when it comes to the costume I know I was bitching and moaning about the,0.69170773
costume and you know what it after seen the movie I don't have a problem,0.07683311
with the new costume and the reason why is because we barely see it there,0.05872862
is a problem with Marvel films and this was most pertinent in the spider-man series,0.14880809
is where they have every five seconds they have to remove the super ass remove,0.8414122
his mask I'm like yo I didn't come here to see the actor I came,0.20825645
here to see Black Panther every five seconds you know his he's taking off his,0.4032052
mask whether it's digital or he's constantly removing it so when it comes to the,0.16782042
action in this movie you would think for a movie titled Black Panther we would,0.3363403
see more of the black panther in action um sadly we do not I think,0.13232581
there's like maybe four for action pieces the first part is the one where he's,0.06873266
in the jungle that was horribly filmed I understand that it's black and that his,0.18552284
suit is black so that makes it hard for bad people to see him but,0.59165645
as an audience member that makes it hard for me to see him as well,0.12565844
so it's black on black on black literally and I'm like I don't know what's,0.5876557
going on in the theater I don't know what's what's happening on screen I can't,0.06510838
see anything one thing I do like about the film is that you know everyone,0.06953034
is strong everyone has a sense of pride in a sense of character like he,0.098982796
goes in to save this girl that he likes which in the trailer they said,0.15607335
you know don't freeze he of course freezes in front of her you know like,0.19383028
his crush or whatever but she you know as soon as she gets that second,0.23795225
to escape captivity she does and she's paying on BAM like these women are trained,0.32772082
as a matter of fact my favorite character throughout the entire movie wasn't even to,0.0647958
chala it has to be his his guard the the bald headed woman who's like,0.5554245
the protector like she is more dedicated to Wakanda than he is and she's more,0.19486828
of a strong and justjust a strong and powerful character like how she's I don't,0.09712201
even say how she's written but how she's portrayed on screen how she does it,0.07870117
it's like help you do not want to mess with this woman I'd rather see,0.4604258
her as Black Panther ten to Charla and I'm gonna tell you why as I,0.33710408
go on in this review so the whole story arc of Black Panther is surrounds,0.2493678
about Jordan P Jordan B's character in Jordan these characters essentially two challahs father on,0.08476187
his brother goes to America sleeps with a woman apparently the white woman because Jordan,0.55270296
he's pretty light and has Jordan B's character the child's father comes comes to America,0.0905787
and confronts him because you know Jordan B's father was selling vibranium and Jordan B's,0.14857204
father his whole ideas you know we need to rise up you know we need,0.1514209
to supply all the blacks with weaponry that we have and we need to control,0.69542736
the world and then by our hand we give out justice that's what he wants,0.14026475
he wants to control the world so long story short Andy's character makes his way,0.06413957
back to Wakanda I'm not sure how he makes his way back to Wakanda because,0.15311982
who he was dependent upon on finding his way there um he kills and that,0.30553278
was Andy Serkis character the claws he straight kills him before he even gets the,0.60453725
directions to Wakanda whatever will bypass that she Jordan B comes back to a condom,0.5776388
with Andy Serkis his character the claw I'm dead he lays it at the the,0.2612776
doorsteps of Wakanda so the big thing about Andy Serkis is character claw is that,0.11109775
T'Challa was supposed to be going to America to get Claude to bring him back,0.105362296
in order to serve justice it's in order for his trial to be had and,0.17124335
you know he promises one of the other members of the tribe who Klaw killed,0.44846055
he killed I think of is his family his mother father or something like that,0.69542736
he's like yo are you gonna bring him back because every one every black panther,0.5876557
including you is said they're gonna do something they have it and to tell us,0.055928387
like I got you I got you I'm gonna bring him back and he's gonna,0.24022368
serve you no justice I promise you that he comes up in D empty-handed right,0.40324453
he comes back sorry he slipped through my hands um which is why it makes,0.10018725
it so important that Jordan be he ends up killing him and brings him back,0.69542736
to a kind of like you know I brought him back your King can do,0.12846014
it I did she draw in B's characters like I want the throne and I,0.060472082
want to fight you in order to get the throne because that's how it's done,0.31089434
and you know touch Allah accepts thing is apparently you can challenge the king at,0.096640974
any point in time regardless of when they're having the tournament or not but whatever,0.06223232
that's neither here or there so they get to fighting right and in Jordan B's,0.060727928
character he wins now listen to me he wins he ends up killing T'Challa he's,0.5442298
them picks him up and throws him off he went he's rightfully the king everyone's,0.244114
devastated all oh my god he's the king I can't believe this we've got to,0.10063235
do something about we got to do something about this and I'm like wait what,0.07721843
do you what do you mean you have to do something about this by your,0.13181467
own rules that you have in place he rightfully won I'd understand a few was,0.11860953
he did something fair he be had the you know Black Panthers power prior to,0.38113782
the fight um but no he fair and square one so I don't so bake,0.1043041
they're completely about to undermine everything old Black Panthers history the culture the heritage all,0.31089434
that undermine it all because they don't like who rightfully is in power not only,0.14902267
that but Jordan B you said you know that the flour that they take it,0.0690222
in order to become to get the powers of the Black Panther Jordan be is,0.07977052
like he'll burn it burn it all and she's like look we can't do that,0.6574426
he's like you know don't you ever holes are up bad throws like don't you,0.50252616
ever tell me what I can and can't do I'm King you burn it all,0.5876557
so they burn it all and I'm thinking to myself you want to tell me,0.46358824
the most advanced country on the face of the planet has no contingency within their,0.34590873
constitution in regards to stopping or thwarting a dictatorship that's what you want to tell,0.122817785
me ok then I start thinking about it I'm like hold up all the kings,0.1314103
and power all they've managed to demonstrate that they they have a physical ability of,0.067889675
physical superiority over everyone else that's it that's all you that's all it is you,0.392107
have to do nor they continue to become a super hero is orange is the,0.14168659
the fight that's it there's no you know tests of mine no wisdom none of,0.08774967
that just you just have to you just have to be physically more domineering than,0.27378762
everyone else I'm like yo that's this Point Blank game stupid and the reason why,0.8319162
it's stupid is case in point Gordon B's character so moving on the mountain tribe,0.74482465
defines a two challahs body and they have them in preservation the family you know,0.24096934
chitara and the sister and everything and his girlfriend all leave and go to the,0.3541893
tribe go to the mountain king and they they offer him they offer him the,0.12877114
the powers of the Black Panther so they are really just crapping on everything that,0.6045764
what Wakanda in the Black Panther stands for they're about to offer a rival tribe,0.15813462
of the powerful Black Panther so the dude is like yo come here let me,0.18832949
show you like here's here's your king here's the child this is who he is,0.103455804
so they give to child the the the medicine of the super powers of the,0.10636278
Black Panther and he wakes up and everything he's like yo okay Simon settle things,0.27401412
I'm like hold up hold up here you can't give him the medicine of the,0.1102632
Black Panther because he lost technically by law he should be dead that's that's it,0.6364068
so this whole idea about what Condor forever we understand from akanda it's all bull,0.1648679
crap because you don't care about what Conda or the laws that they have in,0.8180739
place or the culture because you don't like it that the man that you wanted,0.31089434
to win when the win the fight and all that is now dethroned is now,0.09351515
essentially dead so you guys are willing to to bypass everything history history of your,0.40316653
people in order to put this man to chala back in power and T'Challa isn't,0.15057921
really that big of a king he's not even he's a weak King in my,0.5030749
opinion they managed to cut to China because throughout the history throughout the film they're,0.09062902
battling with this this idea of you know I move a condo or more advanced,0.10063702
we should be able to help people of other countries help our people who are,0.08002363
in the country and we're 2 tallis like y'all know that's that's not our job,0.12009062
that's our responsibility i am king of two I'm king of Wakanda and my job,0.101035886
is for the wakandan people I have no problem I get that he's absolutely right,0.1887764
but even if he did want to help other people war or less privileged than,0.106852956
him then he you know there's other means to do it you just don't cuz,0.11423415
in the movie in the movie I know I'm jumping ahead so so going back,0.053772014
to where I was T'Challa comes back and join me Peterson he's like yo did,0.13660058
the fight all of that determining who's King that's all over to tell us I,0.15304624
go I'm still alive and I didn't concede I didn't concede so the battle so,0.10858572
long so they did the Queen that not the Queen the the the warrior later,0.101271994
she's like yo did the fight is still on technically by the law of the,0.14506951
land by our law the fight is along Jordan B's character looks to the dude,0.07623172
remember the the tribe guy who got his parents killed by cloth he looks at,0.4894021
him as like yo kill T'Challa the Duke goes and does it I'm like there's,0.794439
nobody care about the law or what Conda in the Black Panther tribe like oh,0.31089434
this is just like just a free-for-all all it takes is one person I'm just,0.07869706
like this is crazy this is Magnus because technically the fight should still be on,0.26835498
they should have their fight and make it happen this do goes off and starts,0.15331708
fighting uh T'Challa and their tribe so there's absolute craziness on-screen so because you had,0.30026144
this whole tribe trying to fight a T'Challa and to Charles defending and trying to,0.1170796
stop the ships from going out because Jordan B is like yo sind send the,0.15594022
weaponry through Vance wedding ring to these people we have spies in every country send,0.18367541
them out and let's get this revolution started and to child's like no you can't,0.2130048
have that so he's trying to stop them while fighting the tribe and all of,0.15425205
this and then I'm just like then they have I kid you not they bring,0.24173078
out CGI rhinos and they have rhinos attacking their own people so I'm like yo,0.4336113
did the director - the scriptwriter do they not think this through they had black,0.4322405
people attacking black people I'm like even OMA conduct this black-on-black crime come on so,0.794439
the fight slows down and - child's sister starts fighting torn beasts character in the,0.45748025
child sister and as his love interest and Jordan B is in the middle of,0.1935685
about to kill - child sister T'Challa that's when he jumps he's like no and,0.7684731
he stops him and then we we are we are just words can't describe just,0.07677574
that the the weakness of this film it is so all the hype that was,0.092877954
put behind this film this climax scene between Jordan B's character and T'Challa it's just,0.06849304
that it was so just just we cuckoo came up with this this is this,0.26722646
fight scene was garbage I was severely upset watching this fight scene so wrapping this,0.5909688
all up Jordan be a character ends up dying how I have no idea cuz,0.15201338
the last time I checked the Black Panther potion tears you of any of any,0.18812737
harm or any bruises or scars or wounds it cures you so I'm like you,0.39355916
have superpowers so I'm not sure how he dies whatever they let him die we,0.6364068
wrapping this up we're wrapping this up and T'Challa comes out he goes to the,0.14197983
UN he's like yo we're here we're gonna help basically he's talking about build bridges,0.092994824
not walls all this whoopty whoop all this crap I'm like hold up no no,0.79877067
no no no no No you want to tell me because his girl his his,0.34128955
love in trees is like kill makanda is fall enough to protect ourselves and help,0.5154597
others I'm like obviously the hell you aren't you had one person drawing these character,0.6063446
one guy completely undermine everything completely oh just turn your whole country upside down on,0.35959786
its head one person you want to tell me that a country that the entire,0.15553448
nation finds out that Africa has this vibranium most one the most powerful and you,0.18279706
know allies resources of the world don't the planet and then you're just gonna sit,0.15394646
idly by and let what conduct hand it out well you get this and we're,0.16850586
gonna help you here no of course not that's gonna start a war so like,0.25533473
the hell with Wakanda and all that and as I was saying about the child,0.6374461
being a weak-ass leader he is a weak-ass leader they they freaking cocked I can't,0.897612
believe what I'm saying they come they manage to cook the Black Panther they manage,0.42638528
to cut one the strongest most Alpha characters in the Marvel Universe they manage to,0.08613178
cut this man this dude was all about him and his people and making sure,0.44764584
they survive and they cut this dude because he's not even a strong enough character,0.25280935
a he barely wins the first fight the second fight he dies he loses that,0.27798665
fight the only way even comes back if it was through the power of of,0.15137808
them just completely crapping on the laws of the land so I'm like I eat,0.3681326
all of this and then he goes and just leaves open his people talking about,0.15081388
bridges not walls to two possible attacks inevitable attacks this movie was garbage just straight,0.6997076
garbage anyone who talks about this movie being great and everything you have no sense,0.7453196
of taste you have no respect for yourself and you're just saying it because it's,0.60069144
black panther anyways guys that's the video limit oh you guys see one that I,0.40338653
