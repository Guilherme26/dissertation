seeing wonder woman leap into action and those moments are very carefully placed throughout a very thoughtful,0.15145312
and engaging story make no mistake above all wonder woman is a great story,0.11838018
but still when she leaps into action it is something that I will never forget having witnessed,0.11397531
and then I never ever will get tired of seeing you know everything,0.16948628
that's ever been said about Wonder Woman how she represents women and what they can,0.2412692
and should be,0.057687785
I got to admit in the past,0.07388104
sometimes I rolled,0.08275902
my eyes when that's been discussed,0.10724025
but here I finally get it,0.09103395
she finally I think has become what she was always intended to be,0.11148436
and I have gone from thinking that Wonder Woman is okay,0.26379642
she has her moments to her actually challenging Batman,0.10463333
I can't believe I'm saying this as my favorite superhero,0.06488051
I'm not just talking about raw power although it's an impressive display year but also her ideology that we get to see take shape before us,0.100402586
and I think that in seeing that ideology take shape,0.101511724
we can better understand it and not roll our eyes at it that makes a lot more sense,0.086173944
now when I got out of the press screening we were allowed to tweet about the movie the social and gargle had been lifted,0.06914703
and I said it's one of the best movies not just DC EU or Cod book movies that I've ever seen and one of you tweeted me back J's Lewis and Meryl and you were like Citizen Kane vertigo Seven Samurai Wonder Woman and I say no not Citizen Kane I would say more The Little Mermaid Indiana Jones and inglorious basterds I had to choose that last one very carefully and I set a lot of glorious bastards for several reasons one humor,0.69542736
this is a very funny movie uh to that it rewrites history,0.07584213
you know inglorious basterds played with history,0.5154597
and of course this movie plays without the history of World War one but always very respectfully and also a love of old movies there's a real Turner Classic Movies feel to this Wonder Woman that just permeates the entire film there are scenes that would feel right at home,0.11271146
you know both romantic scenes and scenes about war on Turner Classic Movies it's and if you're a fan of Turner Classic Movies oh you're just going to be an absolute odd,0.19518442
they've been able to fold that into a comic book movie we talked about playing with genres right like oh this is a spy comic book movie this is a horror comic book movie this is a Western comic book movie this is an old-fashioned comic book movie and you're Batman V,0.16978067
Superman I imply applauded for its ambition,0.14721116
but this again it's not only very old-fashioned filmmaking but it has a distinct female point of view,0.15340143
now in the past that has meant a grading viewpoint,0.07505428
men vs. women a lot of negative connotations,0.32472196
and interestingly for the most part up until now or this year feminism and popular entertainment has actually been crafted by men including Wonder Woman herself throughout the decades mostly male creators,0.113552354
but here patty Jenkins and gal gadot and also Emma Watson asked I have to give a shout out and how she shaped Belle because I think this is all part of the same movement are able to finally put feminism a brand of feminism in popular culture that is productive and admirable instead of destructive and grading and now so exciting,0.2628771
I think this is the feminism that so many of us have been fighting for and whenever we see these,0.24113864
some of you recently have said grace,0.12479612
you seem very upset with female characters lately and it's because I'm like that is not where I want representing feminism it makes me look bad and makes all women look bad this this and Belle,0.40446398
please look to this,0.08069293
this is what I want to define feminism and back to that journey that this movie has you take,0.19396143
I think that's really important because instead of just showing you the destination by having you take the journey of feministic thought I think it because are accessible to some people who maybe previously have rolled their eyes effect,0.4626094
I think that every woman who watches Wonder Woman would hope that she shares many of the same qualities,0.33723152
and I also think that they would look at her relationship with Steve Trevor as an ideal relationship of partners,0.040190265
it's so amazing and I want to take a just a slight moment,0.15013596
a moment here before we get into Steve Trevor I have so much to say about Steve Trevor I really want to point out that well patty Jenkins is the driving creative force here,0.082183614
it is very important to note that the screenplay and the story are entirely written by men and it is very much,0.08412199
the message of this movie that it's best when men and women work together and it both have something to offer and that both are corruptible very important,0.3779086
there's been a lot of talk about you know gender separation,0.2549422
and that's that's the pepper feminism we're trying to move away from okay now make no mistake,0.249402
this is very much Steve Trevor's movie just as much as it is Wonder Woman's and as much as this movie maybe a fan of Wonder Woman it made me that much a fan of Steve Trevor,0.07674933
he is her Lois Lane,0.0760931
well what Lois Lane used to be quite tragically,0.14360276
in fact Lois Lane has been sidelined,0.061597858
these days nowhere near the reporter she once was but she said but Steve Trevor he's never been so much of a spy before a man of action,0.12887277
he was just so great and he's every bit as appealing and vibrant as Lois Lane is in her best stories,0.07784503
but unlike Lois sometimes Steve leads and sometimes Wonder Woman leads,0.081718996
they have a pretty good dance going on,0.0881395
and once you see the movie you'll understand that reference and also so importantly Steve Trevor is instrumental in shaping Wonder Woman's ideology he is an incredibly important figure in her life beyond their romance now speaking of Lois and romance,0.106038965
you might recall that in the original Superman movie which is hugely influential on patty Jenkins as you can tell when you see this film,0.10581032
there was a pretty risque line about what color Lois's panties are you know x-ray vision and all that,0.2697589
and this movie is just as playful,0.15043475
what's so much more risque,0.11138799
I was shocked at some of the things they put they put in here,0.079686806
let's just say that Wonder Woman is very curious,0.14986713
and Steve Trevor is more than happy to explain I I was just it was just crazy but I have to tell you it was so much fun and it was so incredibly romantic,0.29850784
I'm like like Titanic level romance,0.074604705
I was amazed at how romantic this film is this is a fantastic date movie but because of some of the risque lines I would advise anyone thinking of taking young children that they might want to see this movie first just to make sure they're okay with some of the things that are referenced in here,0.07861588
you might be like really in a comic book movie in a DC in you movie they would really do that yes,0.242636
let's just say there's Princeton some reference to some male anatomy it's um it's thinly veiled and it's done in a comedic fashion,0.2040047
but it's there,0.03259322
so I only asked for golga dodge I get so many questions about golga dot as to whether or not she's up to up to this role,0.08630928
and let me tell you she is as much Wonder Woman as Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones and Christopher Reeve is Superman from her action scenes too sitting in a bar with Steve and his crew planning a mission to arguing with a British general one of my favorite scenes in the movie every single movement from gal gadot rings true after the action scenes while they are used sparingly,0.08051954
they are masterfully woven into the story,0.09547777
I would say there's an Indiana Jones desk ratio of action to story and it works just as it doesn't Indiana Jones,0.056039575
but when there is action again it is a wonder to behold and that third act boy,0.07290037
oh I don't want to ruin it for you,0.29177126
we will discuss it at length in the spoiler review but let me just tell you it definitely raises the bar and it definitely delivers and still it manages to be faithful to this old-fashioned storytelling which is very impressive,0.047629327
but I have to also add that I actually enjoyed some of the quieter moments in the movie just as much,0.056790914
there are some beautiful,0.050006974
and poignant things said and done that are just so moving and also so haunting we have a lot to discuss in the spoiler review these damn gauntlets I hope they're making too much noise,0.6392135
while I move Wonder Woman's like you know moving magic keeps my armor from distracting from my dialogue,0.18555756
but anyway I also wanted to add the Wonder Woman isn't just about taking but and strength,0.19557887
she has always been about also loving compassion,0.11728164
and I personally have felt that that it's held the character back in the past ivenn like you have to choose,0.046648625
you know I think that your love and compassion is holding you back Wonder Woman,0.25978366
but just as I said I enjoyed some of the quieter moments in the movie as much as the action sequences that just that that embodies Wonder Woman herself and I finally see the beauty of that balance between kicking button strength and loving comparison and I not only see it as a benefit to the character,0.060003106
but it's a benefit to humanity to you to me,0.1488893
and the fact that that movie this movie was able to make such a strong impression on me,0.08766391
and I think particularly at this moment in time is really something amazing,0.050944306
you know what I'm just going to do it,0.06873126
I'm going to take the dark night out of my list of top three films of all time,0.24836963
I've said before everyone has it's hard to choose just one,0.08231783
but everybody can choose their top three films of all time to triangulate them as who they are as a movie goer,0.3079046
and so I'm taking the dark night out with all due respect and I'm putting Wonder Woman in as one of my top three films of all time I just think it's that spectacular,0.2399296
so that's my review of Wonder Woman a film that I feel is absolutely perfect,0.12748179
well it has two little small problems which we'll discuss in the spoiler review but I can't wait and discuss it with you down below if you're if you've seen the movie do not ruin it for people save your spoilery comments for the spoiler review and one last thing a lot of times you guys ask me to to your 3d and as I always say if the studio I let the student dealer's choice right the studio put it in 2d for the press screening and as you can see I had a wonderful time,0.11053233
so that is what I would recommend for this all right so much Wonder Woman coverage coming all week,0.12753907
we are going to have ourselves as I tweeted an amazonian time but right now in this moment,0.058842678
I want to harken back to something pretty amazing that happened on Twitter about a month or so ago you might recall this woman named Karen Bradley her sister was a huge Wonder Woman fan and she was unfortunately awful quite sick,0.53490317
and it was one of her final wishes to get the chance to see this movie unfortunately Melissa did not get to see Wonder Woman but the outpouring of support that was shown to her through my tweets and year tweet,0.10642477
so many of you tweeted about it really meant so much to her and I've kept in touch with her sister Karen and I asked Karen for this review to tell us a little bit about Melissa send me some photos that I can share them with you so that she could be a part of this experience anyway and I have to tell you I was just so absolutely moved by what Karen sent me,0.107683584
I can't do it justice I'm going to put it up on the screen and what I think it's just such an appropriate ending for a review of this film because it fits so beautifully,0.15239121
and it's just such a perfect embodiment of sisterhood human spirit faith and the character faith and patty Jenkins faith and what's in doing,0.08876775
what's right that it is incredibly moving,0.11283229
and I think that particularly once you see the movie you'll see just how fitting and appropriate this is,0.108468905
so I again let's like Karen and her sisters honor wrap this up [Applause],0.082041815
