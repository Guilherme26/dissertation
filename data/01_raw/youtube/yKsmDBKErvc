black clansmen was directed by Spike Lee and stars John David Washington as Ron Stallworth and this is the outrageous true story about a police officer from Colorado played by John David Washington who decides to infiltrate the KKK and he does so by talking to them on the phone but one of his fellow officers portrayed by Adam driver goes to them in person and acts as his surrogate while Ron talks to them on the phone and gets inside their heads and so they're working undercover to try to figure out what they can learn about the KKK in the 1970s and this is a completely insane based on a true story movie and I think Spike Lee's best film since Inside Man I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end I thought it was riveting but most surprisingly very funny I really didn't expect that going in because I tried to stay away from the trailers I've been trying to do that lately where I I don't see too many of the trailers or or know much about the film going in and I found that I enjoy films or at least am surprised by films a lot more in doing that so I was really taken aback by how hilarious this film actually is and how often I was laughing a lot of it is due to the interplay between John David Washington and Adam driver then going back and forth trying to figure out how they're going to play each other one of them's on the phone the others in person this is just such a great idea and it's actually surprising the film hasn't been made up until now because not only is it a very relevant movie for today's times it's just such a great story and for this film Spike Lee has taken a considerably more mainstream approach and I think that was a very wise decision because this film needs to be seen by as many people as possible and to do so you kind of have to adopt more of a crowd-pleasing element to your film even though the story is very dark and in so doing I feel like a lot more people are going to see this movie and a lot more people are going to hear the message and understand its importance there are some historical inaccuracies throughout the film and some things have been more embellished to create more of a theatrical experience and I'm assuming that more than likely some people will find fault with that and thus say this is a bad film or be angry about that but I've never really seen a based on a true story movie that doesn't in some way embellish things or try to make things more entertaining for an audience and that's what this film does a few times and it didn't bother me I I never thought that it encroached upon his message I never thought that it took away from the film I was constantly invested and I had a great time watching it John David Washington I want to see more with him there are many times throughout his performance especially when he raises his voice where I was like wow you sound just like your father right now and it actually gave me goosebumps a little bit but he really did step out of what a lot of people might consider a shadow by being the son of Denzel Washington here he owned this role he gave so much to it he was impeccable his screen presence he was on fire this is a fantastic performance an atom driver as usual was magnificent all of the acting in the film especially for some of the KKK who I imagine were having a very difficult time saying and doing some of the things on screen they really committed to that role and despite how funny this movie actually is it somehow is able to balance the darkness with that light so beautifully because there are scenes where I was almost in tears laughing and then in the next I'm wincing there's a scene where one person tells a story about a horrific Allah violent act and it made me sick to my stomach and like that's the power this film has the end credits in particular I was almost in tears and and so there's a lot to like about this film really the only real issue I can find with it that that bugged me throughout is that it is a little too long perhaps it's just there's a few scenes where the pacing isn't as good as it could be but Spike Lee has balanced those tones of humor and darkness so beautifully and I think that's one of the most important things you can look at when you watch a film is how the director has balanced the tone and it's just about perfect black clansmen is easily Spike Lee's best film in years and I'm gonna give it an a guys thank you so much as always for watching but I also want to give a special thank you to a very special young man that I got to meet recently his name is Sammy
