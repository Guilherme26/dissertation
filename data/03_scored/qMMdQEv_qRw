go to the movies don't wait til it's streaming support your local movie theaters hello,0.108593225
everybody Steph Koza here welcome to my channel check out my fancy new chair whoa,0.26871556
I'll be talking a little bit more about this chair at the end of the,0.11511586
video so stick around if you want to know about my new friend here but,0.24162695
for now it's time to talk about Toy Story 4 so I'm a huge Toy,0.13033704
Story fan who isn't a huge Toy Story fan we all grew up with it,0.1147971
we all watch the movies and they're all just so great honestly probably one of,0.06003707
my favorite Pixar movies of all time is the first Toy Story cuz it just,0.07067817
gives you those those warm bubbly you know makes you feel nice inside until they,0.4285565
made Toy Story 3 and they ripped my goddamn heart out but when they made,0.7093121
Toy Story 3 it kind of closed up the whole story nicely wrapped it up,0.083397366
with a bow and everyone was kind of like alright toy story's over they grew,0.06986333
up with Andy and he sent them off and the journey was complete and it,0.05632236
was done and then they were like hello Norman Toy Story 4 and everyone was,0.055610396
kind of like ok nobody asked for it nobody thought it was gonna happen it,0.14894561
happened here we are and I'm gonna tell you that I am really glad that,0.0574674
it happened I was kind of against this movie even though I love Toy Story,0.12999429
I was like this just feels like a cash grab like it's not really a,0.09640806
necessary film the series felt very complete to me I don't really think Toy Story,0.105780266
4 was necessary however I had a really really really good time watching Toy Story,0.071312755
4 in fact I think Toy Story 4 might be my second favorite of the,0.051285364
toy stories I do need to rewatch number 2 it's been a while but I,0.093270324
did like it better than twice Tori 3 I really did nothing will ever beat,0.087496005
the first one come on come on but Toy Story 3 for me felt very,0.14948791
I don't know it had some good moments and it came at a good time,0.10307235
in my life and it felt very final and it it had a really big,0.09314743
emotional impact on me but as a film I would say it's probably the worst,0.24123015
of all of them it just got a little of weird for me got a,0.22517154
little too extreme and very dark they took a dark turn with Toy Story 3,0.1677579
and I think they realized that in Toy Story 4 because it's much more lighthearted,0.072933935
it's very fun it's definitely the funniest of all the Toy Story movies like I,0.09040856
was laughing the whole time I had a smile on my face constantly it wasn't,0.100222744
very like heart-wrenching I mean it has it has some heart-wrenching moments it's a Pixar,0.08257867
film come on but of all the Pixar films and of all the toy stories,0.15709014
I think it's the one that made me cry the least I actually didn't cry,0.091731645
at all there was like one moment where I was like I was like almost,0.05174929
getting a little there which was a little bit surprising but honestly kind of nice,0.12833746
and refreshing because it just felt very light-hearted and it was a different kind of,0.055768695
journey and it was fun and adventurous and I didn't know where they were gonna,0.07232238
go and I just had a really good time so the story of Toy Story,0.06183796
4 is essentially after the events of Toy Story 3 and Dee grows up he,0.04301282
goes to college and he gives his box of toys away to this little girl,0.44514418
named Bonnie so bonnie is like the new Andy I guess so she has all,0.16682473
these toys they'll have Bonnie written on their shoe they live in Bonnie's room now,0.28361866
that's their whole world and it's a bit of a shock for woody because he,0.14862534
was so used to being the favorite toy and now Bonnie wants pretty much nothing,0.13046803
to do with him and he's just shoved in the closet all the time so,0.31089434
this is very much Woody's story sort of a personal growth sort of thing I,0.05346222
guess they're all kind of Woody's personal growth but this one especially is all about,0.07562596
woody and kind of figuring out himself which sounds weird when you say it like,0.10148185
that but it was very well done there's also a lot of Bo Peep in,0.06289033
this movie she is a huge character in Toy Story 4 which I was a,0.10077386
little bit iffy on at first but no Bo is not here to mess around,0.27726197
bo is the best I love Bo Peep she was one of the best characters,0.06726738
in the movie she was incredible her and woody their dynamic together was so great,0.1049894
she was so fun she was so badass never thought I'd say that about Bo,0.38725287
Peep Keanu Reeves is in this movie he plays a Canadian stuntman named Duke kaboom,0.1572528
if that's not enough to sell you on this movie I don't know what is,0.14996035
he's so great I everything that he does it's it's just so great along with,0.07428953
Duke kaboom we have some other new characters we have forky who is just hilarious,0.31578788
I loved 4q so much I can't wait till they start selling little plush toys,0.15398096
of for ki because even though I could easily make a for ki I'm gonna,0.18464318
buy a for ki we also have key and Peele who played two carnival prize,0.08923453
stuffed animals and just they can do no wrong key and Peele can do no,0.12432134
wrong pretty sure they improved every single line in this film and I'm a hundred,0.11127748
percent okay with that I always get a little bit worried when they introduce new,0.10246958
characters into Toy Story or into series like this but honestly they really carried themselves,0.064941965
if anything they were introduced really smoothly they didn't feel like they were overpowering the,0.06306285
old characters like they're very much around they added a really nice element they made,0.058764253
it feel a little more fresh and they were just really fun and funny and,0.0475034
very enjoyable to watch there are also some new toys introduced that are like the,0.08195844
villain of the story I guess no spoilers but my god they are so did,0.15288168
the stuff of nightmares the stuff of nightmares I just hmm and I think the,0.15464745
animation has like really stepped up since the last horror story movie which makes it,0.06546177
so much more visceral and you really feel like you're in these like tiny toy,0.36295775
sized environments and all of the toys really look like toys that have come to,0.24158259
life like Bo Peep has this very shiny porcelain look to her there are some,0.11129041
other characters that are like terrifyingly accurate like they truly felt like I was watching,0.08706673
a live-action showcase of these toys just like walking around and talking I guess is,0.0663737
the point of Toy Story but it was very convincing I had a smile on,0.06655704
my face honestly the entire time I was watching this film I've I remember when,0.08364295
I when the credits started rolling I was like I can't it's stuck my face,0.115119204
hurts cuz I was just smiling the whole time and literally my face hurt from,0.15230593
smiling it was really fun I would 100% buy this watch it again I think,0.051983103
if you love Toy Story or if you love pick sar or if you just,0.15073845
want to see a good movie go see Toy Story take kids go by yourself,0.27175152
I don't care it's just great like I said I need to watch the other,0.15152965
ones again because it's been a while but I think I would rank them Toy,0.14623722
