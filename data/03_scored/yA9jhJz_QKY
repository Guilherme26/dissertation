Peele who directed the film get out a few years ago which I really enjoyed,0.14892736
had a lot of social commentary and I really enjoyed that vibe that that movie,0.050150752
gave me but with the film us it's more of the classic throwback to a,0.0650426
home-invasion horror film that references home alone at one point and for me that's the,0.11641011
movie I wanted to see the movie starts out in 1986 were the events that,0.042959884
a young girl goes through carry on to present-day now on a quick side note,0.15537295
the majority of this movie takes place at this boardwalk location at the Santa Cruz,0.10085553
Beach and it reminded me of another 1980s horror film that has the same setting,0.07116729
it's called The Lost Boys maybe you've seen it if you haven't well enjoyed this,0.11990567
scene right here I kept thinking about this when watching this film just yeah don't,0.09837601

covered in baby oil and with that said I'm gonna give a big things to,0.0869587

"through my links and get 50,000 silver immediately in a free epic champion as part",0.105327666
of the new player program courtesy of the developers see you there not much like,0.12374786
the film get out this film was also written and directed by Jordan Peele and,0.04772864
my favorite thing that he does as a writer and director is he knows how,0.06237075
to blend comedy and nlgger perfectly together those two genres typically when you make a,0.15735811
movie that has a lot of comedy are scary suspense in it they don't know,0.124414995
how to balance those two things cohesively and sometimes it goes too far one direction,0.07115855
and sometimes it's not scary sometimes it's so funny it takes you out of the,0.17714825
the suspense of the film but when it comes to Jordan Peele as a director,0.06482641
and writer he does this and it's amazing because he can have you laughing your,0.09550241
ass off or have you on the edge of your seat in the next scene,0.8785311
and then laughing again just a few seconds later and never once does either see,0.12344851
and counterbalance each other to where it takes you out of the movie no one,0.2796872
comes to the acting and performances throughout this film it pretty much follows this family,0.050764862
but the main character of the entire film is the mother of the family played,0.038789593
by Anna Peeta and young go and her performance as this character as a smother,0.19297765
was very convincing but she also has a dual role throughout the film and it's,0.053410586
creepy as nlgger it goes something like that but I really enjoyed it and that,0.4204545
same thing goes for every actor throughout this film they all have a dual role,0.0621871
and they play evil versions of themselves now let's talk about the comedy aspect of,0.18763646
this film and before I do that I first have to talk about the father,0.08439901
in the film played by Winston Duke who is more or less the comedic relief,0.08431021
of the entire film and at first he's almost a little too comedic he sort,0.088808954
of comes across as obnoxious but then you learn to love this guy and some,0.43128377
of the one-liners he says even in terrifying suspenseful situations you still laugh and then,0.10747165
you get right back into the sea now no worries no spoilers I wouldn't spoil,0.10069721
anything for you I hate that we have to say that in YouTube videos because,0.28158876
if I'm going to spoil anything for you I'll put spoilers and big capital titles,0.27131048
on the title of the video but anyway one of my favorite scenes in this,0.058861956
film was a home invasion scene and it's bloody and it's gory and it's over-the-top,0.33673137
and in the background there playing NWA and it's it's a thing of beauty it's,0.056587093
the sort of scene I wanted to see in a movie like this and I,0.1099748
got it and speaking of music the score to this movie is amazing it's eerie,0.113241285
at times but it also has the ability to make songs like I got five,0.08376249
on it terrifying to listen to during the climax of the movie and I really,0.08840344
enjoy that I love when a film can take something that's everyday and you never,0.18884447
think of it as terrifying and it can do that and now I'll never listen,0.10041897
to that song the same way again I know it sounds like I'm praised in,0.059242323
this film and maybe I am but I do have some big negatives especially with,0.09818212
the ending to the film I'm going to talk about in just one second but,0.056464348
first I want to say from a comedic element from a horror genre element those,0.1499306
two things were blended perfectly in this movie I can't praise them enough and from,0.065150894
a visual standpoint of being terrified because this is a horror film first and then,0.20993082
a comedy movie second the opening shot to this movie where he had this little,0.17108634
girl walking down the boardwalk and you sort of have this feeling that something Bad's,0.33440882
about to happen and she's walking into the darkness this abyss where she's walking to,0.14870454
the end of the boardwalk and down below you can see the sand and the,0.13393842
beach sent chills down my arms because you could just feel something bad was about,0.30917108
to happen and I loved that like that scene still sticks with me and gives,0.19383024
me a little goosebumps stay on my arm as I talk about it right now,0.1772625
so from a visual standpoint I really enjoyed the way that this film looked because,0.054870296
you got immersed into these environments you got to see those lurking dark shadowy figures,0.32514176
in the background but you also got to see everything that was going on this,0.06016677
is a modern-day horror film that doesn't feel like a modern-day horror film which is,0.09228998
the biggest praise I can really say about this film because it doesn't feel like,0.079770796
a big bloated CG mess with screaming faces and loud sounds every time someone turns,0.33040372
around this movie's nothing like the twenty last terrible horror films I watched of this,0.24538364
year and last year now listen wreck this entire film I was along for the,0.076631136
ride I was enjoying everything I was getting but in the back of my mind,0.16194864
I was thinking okay please by the end of this movie just give me an,0.16384059
explanation I can live with and and somehow makes sense for everything happening and do,0.030604415
they explain everything at the end of this film yeah they explain it they almost,0.07969008
overly explain it because when you're watching a movie like this just give me a,0.13943733
slight explanation and I'll leave the theater happy with my stale popcorn a sour patch,0.10106642
kids in my pocket but I never take the drink because the Ice Cube's melt,0.33582518
and I just yeah warm diet soda tastes like nlgger but once again when a,0.17703101
movie tries to overly explain itself you start asking yourself too many questions and all,0.08203375
I'm saying is I feel like maybe they should have made the explanation a little,0.07140388
bit more vague and small-scale and I would have bought into it a little bit,0.39013863
more but hang on there's there's more that's not even my biggest issue with this,0.2624118
film because at the very end of the film after they explained how these events,0.04040602
came to be they throw a twist into the movie and that twist is a,0.15436287
little too on-the-nose because they could have been a bit more ambiguous with it but,0.18005683
they just blatantly tell you exactly what's happening and I was hoping for something more,0.10618294
along the lines that we got in Inception leave it up for a debate make,0.094492346
us go watch the movie five times and make us have arguments on the internet,0.078910194
for five years to come to talk about ok did that really happen did that,0.051092204
really happen and none of those things will happen now because the movie blatantly tells,0.11485112
you now here are my final flicking thoughts in the film us I really enjoyed,0.07210943
this film it was refreshing it gave me all these different elements combined into one,0.13093156
movie and it did them all so perfectly except for the last 5 minutes of,0.07465521
the movie but this is an ambitious film this is a different film this is,0.107858114
the sort of film I think we should get more of and I appreciate that,0.05239887
and I think Jordan Peele is a director and writer I can't wait to see,0.07709827
what he does next I will say as far as a horror film goes the,0.24001183
film us definitely fits the category more than the film get out did and I,0.058546748
really enjoyed this film I think you guys should definitely check it out I'm going,0.11475208
to give the film us solid B go check out the movie it's a good,0.08805783
time now here's my question for you and let me know down below who would,0.24197426
you say your doppelganger is if I had to pick one well yeah I know,0.24186116
I just ruined Scarlett Johansson for you I'm sorry and my other question to you,0.34331715
is what did you think about the movie let me know that down below in,0.13790274
