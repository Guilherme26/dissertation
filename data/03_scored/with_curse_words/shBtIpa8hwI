learn what it takes to be the next spider-man and save the day before it's,0.20254648
too late enough of that let's get right into the good look good now let's,0.070687674
start off by talking about the animation in this movie it's a pretty slick 3d,0.17953199
style that almost has the motion of old-school claymation despite not being the most traditional,0.10227381
style of animation that many people might be accustomed to it definitely works exceptionally well,0.058161587
for the movie this animation helps accentuate different aspects of the movie more so from,0.052958254
a visual standpoint more specifically the film flows in and out of different kinds of,0.0392724
animation styles at times but in a very subtle way what I appreciated the most,0.07879537
was how at different times the film would just turn into a motion comic book,0.067980655
having that literal comic book element really helps to add that unique touch that comic,0.112609826
book readers are also familiar with the animation serves to be more of a practical,0.05094913
medium to deliver on some of the more heavy concepts and themes if this weren't,0.08147022
an animated movie it would be really hard to imagine some of the sci-fi elements,0.1284809
working in a live-action setting so rather than having to watch live actors in a,0.08192709
movie full of crazy CGI effects it becomes a lot easier for the audiences to,0.3485676
buy into more of these psychedelic visual effects in this film now one of my,0.11753364
biggest concerns going into this movie was whether or not this was really going to,0.07324698
be a Miles Morales story or not luckily it was as you could probably see,0.067781076
in the trailer there are a number of other characters in the film while I,0.025010467
would have preferred more screen time for miles the time share wasn't all that bad,0.10638131
while they each have their own fun and unique moments to shine none of them,0.11700844
truly steal the spotlight away from miles as character you'll love the way miles learns,0.17515703
about his powers and discovers what it truly takes to become a hero another surprising,0.10103156
win for this movie with a really cool action sequence is that it had if,0.06357524
you happen to see the post-credit scene in venom then you'll already know what I'm,0.2420727
referring to as for the drama this movie does have its fair share of feels,0.07504123
- it was great to see how this spider man film was able to tap,0.1768272
into the core elements that make the spider-man character so rich and deep even if,0.078797564
you happen to know the outcome of certain situations for some characters it won't matter,0.08551074
it doesn't take much to feel the pain loss and other emotional challenges that the,0.044196114
characters endure thankfully this movie wasn't a total downer and that's because it was actually,0.08898005
pretty funny I suppose that is to be expected given the fact that Lord and,0.04810498
Miller had a hand in making this film if you're a fan of the past,0.10076278
spider-man movies then get ready to laugh your butt off as this film pokes fun,0.7568009
at the spider-man movie franchise and drops a number of funny callback references don't laugh,0.07771268
too hard though because you may miss out on some of the jokes seriously even,0.1390599
the lyrics to the outro credits are pretty funny and before I forget the soundtrack,0.055069253
for this movie was just perfect the music transitions seamlessly at different moments to amplify,0.063580185
the setting or mood during scenes better yet every song sounds like something Miles Morales,0.058852214
would actually listen to as a result both the music and the main character become,0.0478529
a bit more relatable now besides having the comedy the drama and the action it's,0.11243778
really the characters that serve to be the backbone of this movie shameik Moore was,0.24252269
perfectly cast as Miles Morales and Jake Johnson was an ideal fit for this version,0.095318235
of Peter Parker that he portrays I think the potential fan favorites that literally got,0.03923533
me to laugh out loud will come from Nicolas Cage and John Mulaney spider-man characters,0.1540924
okay enough of that let's get right into the bad the bad now the only,0.18864636
issue I really have with this movie stemmed primarily from well the animation that I,0.07736282
praised earlier while it is vibrant and colorful there's a bit of blurriness that occurs,0.15236661
throughout the movie the best way to describe it would be like if you ever,0.11928477
walked into a 3d movie and forgot to put your 3d glasses on I'm pretty,0.32159236
sure this blurriness was done intentionally since it does maintain the character on screen to,0.07398824
be in full focus either way it's just a little bit distracting at times okay,0.16383937
enough of that let's get right into the reason the reason spider-man into the spider,0.18809621
is hands-down the best spider-man movie to date now I had heard people mention that,0.101738214

just does so many things well that it's incredibly hard to deny its awesomeness if,0.10046878
you were halfway hesitant on seeing this just because it's animated worried not the content,0.10538625
is definitely suited more so for teens to adults and I am so happy that,0.05198032
this movie represented Miles Morales in an authentic and positive way I think this film,0.101811744
