[Applause] [Applause] everyone today I've got your Dunkirk movie review based on the heroic true,0.0886189
story from the frontlines at Dunkirk soldiers fight for survival is this the war film,0.09014375
that we've been waiting for so as far as the story goes Christopher Nolan directs,0.08526495
this action packed so I'm not bringing back to a time when opposing forces were,0.06980048
fighting or evacuating to a beach for safety I am a huge fan of Christopher,0.10602867
Nolan has been a fan of many of his films and I personally think that,0.15372552
a war genre film I think is definitely fitting for a director like him I,0.17662513
think he did a good job with how he was setting up this film and,0.067551665
wanting to tell this story because it is a very important story one that maybe,0.06360167
I wasn't too familiar with in the beginning until I saw this film and I,0.0658198
got to learn more of what exactly went on in this one period of time,0.095475025
I think he does deliver of film that you can really learn the history of,0.10932724
you know what happened at Dunkirk some things might be a little confusing at times,0.05989624
right away you see these soldiers who are in abundance they're trying to get off,0.15001617
this beach they're all sort of collectively forming these lines and some of them a,0.113624565
majority of them were alive and on some of them you see weren't I was,0.1443301
almost horrific to see but that was the reality of war where they were going,0.09852759
to be casualties it's also even scarier when you had to see them doctor times,0.16647156
every time a point would show up you knew that something was about to go,0.063697904
down and even when they were on their ships or at least trying to get,0.10772664
to them or trying to get off of them sometimes I felt like this movie,0.09952843
was hard to follow because throughout the film you know they have all these different,0.036310017
types of characters the story goes back and forth following these different characters with their,0.020134058
own points of view women will be data and then the next it'll be nighttime,0.31678033
so it kind of gets confusing when all of that happens as far as the,0.074484706
casting goes you've got a pretty good cast in this movie definitely a lot of,0.1491286
a listers that I'm glad to see in Christopher Nolan film some who have previously,0.1448528
worked with him and some whom are newcomers and even somewhat to acting but you've,0.07478994
got Mark Rylance he's on this boat and he takes his son and this other,0.096542455
boy along for the ride to go help pick up these soldiers who could be,0.08820476
stranded on the wharf once and I really liked seeing him in this movie even,0.20713042
though sometimes he felt very defeated against some of these other characters you've got Killian,0.30267307
Murphy who is someone who you you kind of don't want to trust but then,0.23618613
you also feel sorry for him all at the same time and he comes to,0.12969585
contact with Mark Rylance his character so I like to see him here as well,0.08261194
you've got Harry Styles who if you are a One Direction fan it was really,0.12818538
cool to see him preparing himself for this role he had to cut off all,0.52018833
of his hair and he had to go full commitment as a soldier and although,0.06191958
I feel like he doesn't have as much screen time I think it was just,0.08190039
really cool to see him actually pull off his role so I think he did,0.14516279
at least a piece of performance Tom Hardy who plays a pilot who you see,0.0665381
a lot in the air he's a great actor and it's very believable and he's,0.11927859
very a you know believable in this role and he's also very intense at times,0.082388334
and I just loved seeing him here as well as Kenneth Branagh who I felt,0.1286439
like was going to have a much bigger role in this film but I wasn't,0.06626734
too disappointed when he didn't but I'm at least glad that I got to see,0.09275814
him portray the sort of captain character and he definitely pulls it off things that,0.060138557
I liked about this movie was right off the bat seeing that beautiful cinematography I,0.15374535
know Christopher Nolan is very good with his IMAX cameras this movie should definitely be,0.09607135
seen in IMAX however I didn't see it in I'm expand when the scenes that,0.036964387
were shot in IMAX came out I knew man like that just all looks so,0.2751077
cool and there were these intense scenes that you know sometimes put me on the,0.0938915
edge of my seat and I was literally just seeing the danger that these guys,0.104957946
were in and you really felt like you were there with these action scenes that,0.1061441
were put together well and you felt the realism when they're on the ships or,0.10268284
they're in the air it was almost heart-stopping to watch these moments unfold especially when,0.0569595
it gets intense when you're on the front lines with these soldiers and sometimes they,0.0792519
can be caught crossfire or ambushed and it just gets terrifying but unfortunately the things,0.17790832
that I didn't really like about this film was that while some parts of the,0.080770716
movie were fast paced I couldn't help but feel like there were a couple scenarios,0.07013308
that were constantly being played out over and over again and repetition and I felt,0.11486641
like I couldn't see any results coming from that which is why I feel like,0.03740271
they just kept on constantly doing the same things over and over again so we've,0.051529538
made the film feel a little bit slow and dragged out and I was really,0.09409922
surprised because I had no idea that this was an over to hour-long film and,0.059507985
that's what made it so fast paced doesn't made it go by so fast because,0.056932446
of all the other scenes but then without those seams this movie dragged on overall,0.083546214
I thought that this movie you know it wasn't disappointing to me but I was,0.12501097
slightly disappointed the fact that it's not one of my favorite Christopher Nolan films out,0.104799986
there unlike his Batman self it was exactly what I expected it to be I,0.10443777
wouldn't say I was completely disappointed by it in the end so I would still,0.07304895
highly recommend seeing this movie to anyone whether you're a a war film buff or,0.26004767
you're a history buff I think this is a movie to definitely check out even,0.31089434
if at times it does miss its mark so I would give this for hearts,0.07871377
on the heart rate scale so let me know in the comments what you guys,0.061741803
