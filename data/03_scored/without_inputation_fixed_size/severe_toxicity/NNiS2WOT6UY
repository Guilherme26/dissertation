so last week the Irishman the latest film from Martin Scorsese dropped on Netflix with,0.023623332
the holidays and my birthday it took me a few days to find a block,0.04087354
of time where I could watch the entire thing but I finally completed the irishman,0.058777623
challenge so let's talk about it the Irishman tells the epic story of Frank Sheeran's,0.041378412
time is a mafia hitman spanning multiple decades so prior to this films released there's,0.26180303
been a lot of talk about what is true cinema the MCU all sparked by,0.020272138
comments from Martin Scorsese but now we have the movie itself and we can evaluate,0.023174997
it on its own terms so before I give my thoughts on it go and,0.05104686
tell me what did you think down below in the comment section did you love,0.075574175
it is it one of the best of the year is this true cinema we,0.0103961555
a little bit disappointed was it too long all of that fun stuff let me,0.08731267
know your take also let me know if you happen to have been able to,0.041267995
see it in the theater only got a limited theatrical release for a Scorsese film,0.08067281
this is the kind of film you really do kind of want to see in,0.059318416
the theater let me know if you were able to do that down below in,0.123782694
the comment section with that said let's get started talking about the good in the,0.0138990125
first thing you have to talk about with this movie is of course the fantastic,0.040661346
performances from our three leads you've got three Hollywood icons essentially returning to the genre,0.016866397
that puts them on the map as Hollywood icons in the case of Joe Pesci,0.047191452
he's essentially been retired for something like 20 years and has been telling people no,0.024019117
for decades and finally this is the movie that he decided to return for Martin,0.016883027
Scorsese for this specific project and he absolutely brings his a-game and you kind of,0.049632676
remind you how good he really is like in my household I've got two kids,0.10041745
I got three kids under the age of 10 and so we watch home alone,0.053800717
all the time and then I watch the Lethal Weapon movies all the time that's,0.1555472
what I see a lot more of than some of his more gangster kind of,0.2144173
an actual award-winning stuff and kind of just remind you how excellent of an actor,0.04569346
he really is in the big stuff in the subtle moment he can do it,0.021629112
all but he's been out of the spotlight for a very long time the other,0.03574963
two kind of leads here with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino these are guys,0.02010717
that of course we know their a-game is the best there is but for whatever,0.04075048
reason a lot of the roles that they've gotten over the last 20 years have,0.010442718
been a little bit questioned allah some times they've been comedic stuff that you just,0.21400954
seems a little bit embarrassing why are they doing some of this stuff he wondering,0.07123452
like did they lose it a little bit if they kind of lost theirs no,0.050544646
no no they just didn't happen to get the right roles as soon as they're,0.039208584
working with Scorsese again I mean they are just kind of fantastic in convincing you,0.077233806
that they are like turning into these people it's very like with you know Al,0.056078974
Pacino is showing up in Adam Sandler copies and stuff like they kind of forget,0.091866516
in some of the other stuff he's even kind of done over the last 20,0.03215032
years it just seems like he's doing his Pacino isms whereas here it gets back,0.040882852
into acting and transforming into the jimmy hoffa in this film and you buy him,0.10689302
as the charismatic leader guy that's rallying all these people that behind-the-scenes really believes he's,0.06887112
doing the right thing even though he's very much doing evil things and through some,0.10164206
of the stuff that he's doing the pride all of it because also Robert Robert,0.019137334
DeNiro as well here similar types of situation of some of the stuff he's done,0.02922684
recently like kind of questionable and then you see him here as this guy that,0.03995093
left World War Q with a little bit of an emptiness in his soul that,0.31899923
allows him to do just kind of awful things and just kind of shrug it,0.14184974
off and keep on going and as you go throughout the movie and you just,0.025952805
kind of see the sadness of his existence as it continues forward and he just,0.07564735
plays that while never kind of surrendering the coldness of never surrendering the pride but,0.03350397
you just seeing the toll that it takes upon him also it's a movie that's,0.0396363
a return to kind of these classic prestige underground crime mafia type films that you,0.187786
know over the decade gates there's been many of these that have been created but,0.016471943
over the last decade it's a genre that's kind of gone away a little bit,0.07975751
until you have this legendary director returning to one of his genres that we haven't,0.025726642
seen much of lately and doing a classic version of one of these massive stories,0.031445228
of underground crime spanning large amounts of time huge cast complex plots true drama layered,0.103199914
on top of each other there's just neat to see that again it's also a,0.01912669
movie that for its very long run time which we will talk about that later,0.04981627
in this it's actually a very quickly paced movie it's not long because the scenes,0.05388054
just drag out and there's these extended amounts of dialogue and monologues and open it's,0.056496043
not like that it actually jumps around at a very brisk pace between different plot,0.048299648
lines different time periods different characters there's a lot of different pieces and it touches,0.036772016
on them in a way that you're constantly feel the forward motion and movement inside,0.028584937
of it and so it's it's it's long in a very strange kind of way,0.05348143
because it's just not like most movies like this which was a very pleasant surprises,0.051852394
I've been scared of the runtime going into it it's also a film that gets,0.055087183
very emotional as you move into the third act the first two acts set up,0.052586757
these characters their relationships the dynamics between all of them and then you start moving,0.043567535
into the final hour and some little tragedy hard choices you start to see the,0.020716479
toll that it's taking on them and you see their full lives play out and,0.03390441
where the choices that they've made lead them at the end of their lives and,0.086056136
it really packs an emotional punch as you see all of this play out the,0.1339008
way that it's handled really nicely done inside of that third act with that said,0.0456469
let's move on to the mixed aspects of the film the big thing here is,0.012957778
with a movie of this scope and size with so many plot lines and characters,0.038023226
and seeing these characters at different points of time in their life and it's kind,0.059614424
of jumping around a little bit certain things work entirely clear as we're watching it,0.04728857
my wife said there's a whole lot being implied here that's not clearly stated and,0.03928375
to some extent that's a good thing you don't want the director to treat you,0.042988822
like you're an idiot and over explain everything but because it's so big cuz there's,0.6124203
so much going on at times there we were having conversations while watching the movie,0.028684715
to make sure we weren't confusing which character was which and you know and Anna,0.009572658
Paquin shows up at one point I'm like is that his daughter to his daughter,0.14306504
right which one is it they trying to piece together who is what because there's,0.017431138
just so much to take in in process and it implies a lot it doesn't,0.0100323
spell it out and that can make things at confusing at times I think it,0.031863626
could have done a little bit more to give a couple more details to make,0.022006271
it clear exactly when things were happening how things things tie together but at the,0.024637071
same time I mean I appreciated that you didn't think I was an idiot now,0.36967084
maybe I am a little bit of an idiot now that's why I mean he,0.56777984
spelled out a little bit more but it's kind of is on that right on,0.058222193
that line of did I need a little bit more was it good that it,0.036758713
made me think a little bit and pay attention I'm not entirely sure from there,0.022420015
let's move on to the fat and the big thing here is a little bit,0.14081405
what I kind of implied a little bit earlier but I found the payoff of,0.036972903
the third act to be a lot more engrossing than the set up of the,0.026509564
first two acts now there was a lot of things inside of the first two,0.040124543
acts that were great in scenes that I loved in the general vibe of it,0.05528541
I think worked but there's just so much there and so much to take in,0.02015839
that I think it kind of felt kept me at arm's dinks lengths distance at,0.039149385
times because I'm just trying to sort through all the information all the characters are,0.014336038
lead the Robert DeNiro character is intentionally kind of cold-hearted and so you don't initially,0.015655762
have a big emotional connection to him because he is this hit man that's just,0.09191574
okay with what he's doing and because all of that it made the third act,0.067080446
really stand out and connect with me and resonate with me a lot more than,0.04448083
what came before hand but by comparison during that third act I like felt the,0.0163715
dread of where things were headed I was scared of certain things the choices that,0.028319528
might be made at certain points in time and felt the loneliness of these characters,0.029428389
and I didn't feel that in the first two acts I wasn't sure what I,0.03488223
was supposed to feel at certain points in time I just kind of like interested,0.013524514
in the narrative and then other times I was like okay what am I even,0.039064907
supposed to be paying attention to here and so that third act when it focused,0.01841694
a lot more and we understood the relationships that's when the move you really found,0.03180376
its stride for me and I'd say this is but a lot of discussion on,0.045695454
Twitter as to people posting like hey if you want to watch it in four,0.042745367
chunks here's how you should break it down into four episodes and people like thrashing,0.22161724
them like this is meant to be watched one sitting I don't maybe I shouldn't,0.022090748
say this but I mean I think that there's a lot of merit to the,0.03816225
idea of watching this as four different episodes like if they actually intentionally cut it,0.10940009
that way and you retweet they absolutely the piece is just a little bit to,0.06528778
make for 50 minute episodes out of this that were clearly focused in each piece,0.020182338
I think that would have worked really well I also think the movie if you,0.031127933
trimmed it down to about 2 hours 45 minutes I think it would had a,0.050069705
lot more clarity inside of it and had a lot more punch from beginning to,0.08558386
end as is I think it was just a little bit too big at least,0.12438269
for a film that you're watching at home that's a different experience like if I,0.028129952
was in the theater I think I would have experienced this from very differently than,0.016821165
watching at home with all the distractions the things that happened dogs walking in kids,0.15691882
waking up the things that happen when you're in your home versus the escapism of,0.027355012
a theatre changes the experience and this as a one sit-down movie for three and,0.03226673
a half hours it was a bit rough for me even though there's so many,0.04716285
great things inside it real quick before I give you my final thoughts on this,0.060318187
one be sure to share your thoughts down below in the comment section I know,0.043944694
a lot of people are loving this movie they think it's a masterpiece and so,0.03408135
I think I've imagined we have a bit of a lively discussion between the two,0.016812516
crafts that people have thought it was fantastic and the people that thought it was,0.07369636
a little bit too long and dragged out just be respectful let's share our opinions,0.13864423
the Irishman is a very good film with fantastic performances but that I did think,0.057886276
was a little bit too long even though it did move at a nice brisk,0.09473479
pace it's an a-minus overall it's a 7.5 the entertainment scale and I guess I'd,0.038084425
say it's a must watch for cinema fans be sure to tell me what you,0.034368042
thought down below in the comment section if you want more videos like this check,0.07490234
