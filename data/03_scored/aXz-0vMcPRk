"Dunkirk is a true story of 400,000 soldiers stranded on a beach desperately awaiting evacuation",0.06386556
as the enemy slowly closes in Dunkirk as directed by the savior of Batman himself,0.1978778
Christopher Nolan either guys how are you so before we dive into Dunkirk there's a,0.06911071
few things I need to let you know about myself the first thing is it's,0.078618325
four o'clock in the morning I'm drinking a Red Bull and did you know I'm,0.15461585
utterly insane and the other thing is going into this film I wasn't as excited,0.3518897
as I wanted to be and the last thing I wanted to let you know,0.068110816
is I am by no means a Christopher Nolan fanboy and if you're asking yourself,0.1532679
right now John don't you love the Dark Knight trilogy maybe more than you should,0.070967324
and that I would say you're absolutely right I do enjoy that trilogy along with,0.18027316
inception and a prestige but I do have issues with a lot of other Christopher,0.057921354
Nolan films I could probably sit around for 12 hours talking about my issues with,0.15080819
the film interstellar but I'm not going to do that I just wanted to let,0.07484103
you guys know those things so now let's talk about the film Dunkirk now the,0.044152368
film Dunkirk is based on true events and when you make a film like this,0.055495456
interjecting as much realism into it as possible will always make for a better story,0.07387191
and going into this movie I wanted to see a great war film where you,0.20921132
got to see Christopher Nolan utilize his talents that separate him from other directors and,0.06293926
in many ways I feel like I got the film I didn't know I wanted,0.06611878
to see but I got it and it was told and only a way that,0.027368007
Christopher Nolan could have made it this movie by no means is total with that,0.06767155
standard Hollywood storytelling structure and neither is the character development and we'll talk about both,0.044236742
those things in just one second and when it comes to Christopher Nolan he likes,0.07972807
to bring a level of practicality and realism to his films and when you combine,0.2510618
those realistic filmmaking techniques along with a true story the level of realism for me,0.112170674
at least it definitely impacted me it felt real I could feel the explosions I,0.0998723
could see the despair and when people were trying to survive and doing anything that,0.11902711
it took I emotionally was invested just based on that because any time a filmmaker,0.06484187
can utilize practicality in a film it will always go further telling the story then,0.061626326
green screens or digital explosions ever could my point is whenever a film can utilize,0.069590785
practical effects you don't feel like there's this wall of CG in front of you,0.15365894
and the film what's that gone you feel like you're immersed into the movie and,0.12942973
you buy into everything that you're seeing up on the big screen now let's talk,0.09483837
about the story of Dunkirk itself this is a fascinating story and going into the,0.04960886
movie I knew a little bit about it but I had no clue of all,0.067908384
the elements that the film was going to include I thought the movie was going,0.04244668
to be just about soldier stuck on a beach waiting for fisherman to come pick,0.08442735
them up but there's so much more to this movie now when I tell you,0.07560842
this story try to put yourself in this situation because that's what I do when,0.06800709
I watch movies like this and it just really it sends chills down my spine,0.15368247
because it scares me and it makes me question what I would do in these,0.085071675
"situations 400,000 soldiers are stranded on a beach desperately trying to get evacuated while the",0.06928949
enemy surrounds them and slowly closes in and overhead there's enemy bomber planes dropping bombs,0.26668942
on them and there's nowhere to hide and the only way out of this deathtrap,0.35122022
is to get on one of these boats where there's not enough for everyone it's,0.09518905
almost like the Titanic there's only so many lifeboats for the passengers on board and,0.055446066
everyone left behind is going to die and it's not like the movie Titanic where,0.5339729
if you pull it around on a door watching your boyfriend slowly freeze to death,0.78983855
you're going to survive now this movie's an hour and 26 minutes long and for,0.14416882
a nolan film that seems rather short and going into the movie i thought that,0.15162578
might have been a weak point but after watching the movie i understand it because,0.09334762
this movie has no filler it has no fluff it gets straight to the point,0.20529528
and it never stops and in many ways this film is one big action sequence,0.07412389
where you never get a chance to breathe or relax and I think that's what's,0.11463602
so pivotal about this film is it makes you feel like you're in the situation,0.10253584
you can feel the suspense you can feel the desperation of the characters now let's,0.06564782
talk about the characters in this film and most importantly the character development in this,0.040969048
movie which seems to be everyone's biggest issue with this film the film Dunkirk doesn't,0.076519266
contain a lot of those other war film cliches that you've come to known over,0.15121464
the last thirty years of war and most other war films to get to know,0.09125109
the characters there is always that one scene where they're sitting down bullets are flying,0.1957506
overhead and they're talking to each other about their lives back home there's always the,0.084806375
intellectual guy the guy from the south who likes to go hunting and there's also,0.19220926
always that other guy from Brooklyn who says something like this you know what I'm,0.10624741
going to do when this was over I'm going to go back home to Coney,0.14783016
Island and get a hot dog this big yeah they always say something like that,0.20994096
and in the film Dunkirk there are no scenes like that because in reality which,0.06810085
was what Dunkirk was trying to go for there is no time to sit around,0.08531568
talking about eating hotdogs when you're trying to claw your way to survive there is,0.11713859
no point where the characters have time to relax and share stories like that nor,0.040657654
do they care too so when it comes to the characters and the development of,0.050995585
the characters in this movie I learned a lot about all the main characters in,0.052649308
this film because their actions speak louder than words one of the main characters in,0.08007224
this film is a young soldier named Tommy and throughout the film his character is,0.017379716
doing everything he can possibly think of to get aboard one of these ships just,0.13759948
for a chance to survive his character is always thinking outside of the box he,0.06056182
refuses to wait in a line with 20 other thousand guys to get aboard a,0.09667323
ship he knows he'll never get on and the way that he thought his mindset,0.1610815
it kind of resonated with me because I thought to myself I would probably be,0.0627478
doing the same things he's doing to get off this Beach I understood his motivations,0.15218468
I got him as a person true I didn't understand his hobbies or where he,0.15094444
was from or if he had a girlfriend or not but those things weren't relevant,0.12565617
to the situation that he was in I learned everything about him as a man,0.15305547
that I needed to know he was a good person he wanted to help other,0.055357564
people and on the flip side of that in the film Dunkirk you see cowards,0.7450809
you see men that will kill and call their way to survive while they step,0.55558383
on the heads of others to do it so as far as the character development,0.16034712
goes in the film Dunkirk it could be considered its weakest element but for me,0.06912864
it was one of my biggest positives with the film because I understood who these,0.18451658
characters were in this situation and in some other films that way of storytelling you,0.09932759
might not quite pan out but with this situation that they're in and the events,0.059378285
happening around them it's all you needed to know as a viewer to root for,0.09637013
them and I was rooting for this character Tommy I wanted to see him make,0.06215966
it off of this beach and back home now this film has a lot of,0.1214471
characters in it but I want to talk about one more main character and that's,0.04715805
played by Tom Hart and Tom Hardy in this film plays a British fighter pilot,0.0028065378
protecting these soldiers from the sky against enemy planes and aerial attacks and every scene,0.15457766
throughout this movie with Tom Hardy and his fighter plane having dogfights with enemy planes,0.15816209
and protecting boats in the ocean down below were some of the best scenes in,0.098417774
the film during some of these aerial dogfight scenes you get a POV shot of,0.27853304
what Tom Hardy sees in his cockpit as he lines up the enemy plane in,0.19788677
his sights before he takes it down and when I was watching it it almost,0.1534026
gave me an adrenaline rush like I have a fear of heights and I just,0.11125497
felt tingly all over just I really enjoyed watching that it felt like I was,0.06914054
there it was intense it was amazing to watch I really enjoyed it and I,0.103242956
really haven't seen a film capture dog fighting like that with a sense of realism,0.060742073
well I guess ever I mean Top Gun was pretty good but I bought into,0.095228
this movie a little bit more also one other quick thing I wanted to mention,0.20972715
about this movie is it's a pg-13 movie and it's one of those movies that,0.106632136
definitely lends itself to be rated R because there are gruesome events happening there's bombs,0.29617187
there's bullets there's explosions I thought the movie did a good job at showcasing how,0.29040745
violent these events were without the blood guts and gore not to say that those,0.55332166
things don't work in other war movies like Saving Private Ryan where the shock value,0.10552148
is truly there but in this film I didn't think it was necessary throughout this,0.0586218
film there are multiple storylines being told at once some of those storylines span the,0.049070448
course of five days some an hour and they mix all those things together where,0.065651454
you might be confused a few times throughout the movie and during the first half,0.08879088
of the movie I had to think for a few seconds when they jump to,0.08927246
another storyline I was like wait wait where what's happening what are we doing so,0.05206782
that element might be confusing to some people me personally I like the way the,0.07450333
movie was told it made it more suspenseful with that method now here my final,0.09641053
flicking thoughts on the film Dunkirk I really didn't think I would enjoyed this movie,0.08392523
as much as I did it felt like a true cinematic experience and it made,0.066946834
me feel something as a viewer as a guy who just likes movies I really,0.1859602
enjoyed the experience of watching this movie I was glued to it I was very,0.0727179
interested now does that mean that this is a perfect movie in every sense no,0.08899251
it's not there are a few things throughout this film that I thought could have,0.065222934
been explained more or expanded on I also didn't enjoy one storyline it's not that,0.058236796
it's bad but it has to do with this family on a yacht and I,0.1443534
understand why this storyline was in the film because you need a perspective from the,0.102013
fishermen who are coming to save these soldiers but at the same time I guess,0.058576196
it was the weakest part of the film or at least the slowest part in,0.08943328
my opinion but as far as the overall tone and pacing of the film goes,0.070934705
I enjoyed it it felt like an adrenalin ride for an hour and 46 minutes,0.12717028
and also when you have Hans Zimmer's score playing throughout this film and you see,0.089440204
airplanes and bombs and people just trying to survive it feels like a ticking clock,0.2684936
counting down and you're just waiting for something bad to happen and it does over,0.15131356
and over and over and I might just say this is probably one of Christopher,0.061538134
Nolan's best looking films that he's ever directed and don't get me wrong I love,0.24139251
the Dark Knight I love Inception but from a visual standpoint I feel like this,0.06789153
movie does more than either one of those films did I'm really surprised I'm doing,0.103486165
this because going into this film I had reservations but I'm going to get the,0.097887106
film dunkirk Oh an A+ whoa an A+ I guess I really like that movie,0.16594341
I can't remember the last movie I gave an A+ for but as far as,0.031788893
this film goes it's not because I'm a Nolan fanboy that's not the reason I,0.12934472
loved it there was no blind love towards this movie going into it once again,0.08298966
I wasn't that excited to see the movie and the reason I gave this film,0.108118236
an A+ is this movie met every single expectation I wanted from a war film,0.107963845
and then went beyond those and surprised me with different elements of telling this story,0.065540224
that made it unique that made it original in many ways where it could have,0.05495331
been cliche and it could have played it safe but it took a chance it,0.044111
did something new it took out all the filler all the fluff and it made,0.20864025
it about the event and it made you feel like you were part of it,0.069381855
alright guys that's my take on the film Dunkirk now here's my question to you,0.070391245
