hi everyone its Alisa and this is always a mushy the place that encourages you,0.060000896
to go out get dressed up and watch a movie so today I am reviewing,0.116930634
ladybird and that stars Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf and it is directed and written,0.08353509
by Greta Gerwig and I'll start by saying that this is one of the best,0.029486261
coming-of-age films that I've ever seen in my life but I want to add the,0.055043947
caveat that coming-of-age movies are not always my favorite genre so this is an excellent,0.040141836
film within the genre but there are always going to be movies that I like,0.020451736
more than this type of movie so the film centers around Christine who has renamed,0.020689873
herself to Lady Bird and that's played by Saoirse Ronan and she's just trying to,0.059245247
navigate herself within Sacramento California and trying to figure out who she is and she's,0.051949512
kind of this moderate rebel who thinks she's a lot more you know hard-hitting and,0.18946558
edgy than she actually is and she's just trying to work within the confines of,0.07263938
this really strict parochial school that she lives in and also trying to find a,0.02019298
balance with her mother who is just overly protective and totally controlling but you can,0.08282268
see that the mother really loves her daughter and that's played by Laurie Metcalf beautifully,0.062370278
she's she's incredible in the film and you know so the film really has all,0.0242506
of the story arcs that you've come to expect in a coming-of-age story you have,0.021143528
things like first boyfriend's trying to prove yourself to the wrong crab fights with mom,0.21545032
there's the desire to get away from the nest and yes even prom but the,0.026627302
film handles all of these milestones with a great sense of realism and then there's,0.069705926
just like this little bit of nostalgia thrown in as well and what I've really,0.17493133
loved about the story is that even though the entire story it centers around Lady,0.059973624
Bird I felt like I really understood beside characters and they were really well developed,0.021504723
so everyone from father to her best friend to her first boyfriend they all had,0.038579322
lives that were going on outside the screen and even if they were in that,0.044625174
particular scene I felt like I knew who they were and I knew what they,0.036969576
were doing and that's really a testament to Greta Gerwig 'he's writing it really is,0.012568645
a brilliant screenplay it's very well thought out and you know I would be shocked,0.02533884
if she didn't get a nomination for Best screenwriting I think she did a wonderful,0.025760567
job in just developing all these characters even certain characters that you would think would,0.050996304
be like stock throwaway characters like you know the new friend that Lady Bird is,0.029719075
trying to make who's rich and obnoxious and self-centered and yes that character is all,0.19857195
of those things but there's actually a few moments in the film where you see,0.022195848
she's not just everything that she presents to everyone else and I really like that,0.061355874
there wasn't one stock character in plays like the bad girl or like the dorky,0.36860028
bestfriend they all had layers to them and I really appreciated that in her writing,0.052273456
the film also takes on some interesting points in in terms of class division in,0.01367285
suburban neighborhoods so when a lot of suburbs there will be you know people who,0.07128507
are really big upper class upper middle class and then there are the houses that,0.03087982
are middle-class you know lower middle-class and you know that there is this great divide,0.048797872
so while no one is living in poverty it still affects the way that certain,0.028825734
characters have to present themselves to others and I thought that was something I wasn't,0.010334293
quite expecting in a film like this Lady Bird is quite literally from the other,0.11491779
side of the tracks and it affects her on a daily life going to this,0.080162615
very rich exclusive parochial school and then the other thing that I thought was so,0.04444624
interesting is it kind of goes into that quintessential you don't know what you got,0.054665457
till it's gone the way that teenagers always look at the place where they grew,0.03969949
up as just the lamest place in the world but when you look back on,0.13318706
it you see that your family and your environment it's actually so much better than,0.036091533
you ever thought it was when you're growing up and when you leave you kind,0.12653057
of can't wait to come back home and feel that comfort again the film also,0.03202194
does a pretty good job in terms of the way that it's shot there's a,0.066542976
lot of you know muted neutral colors it is very nostalgic looking and you have,0.03333102
you know just some lovely beautiful shots in the film although I will say that,0.09633256
I don't think the movie actually utilized all of the film techniques that they probably,0.017470384
could have so you know this movie is much more about story character and heart,0.014705215
and for me to think a film is perfect it really needs to have all,0.03661703
of those components plus some inventive film artistry which shines most about this film is,0.03165609
definitely the performances and I don't have a doubt in my mind that Saoirse Ronan,0.070025876
is going to be nominated for Best Actress for the Academy Awards and the Golden,0.016573716
Globes it's the exact kind of character and performance that I feel will certainly get,0.013474626
nominated and she is deserving of it and I'm pretty sure that Laurie Metcalf is,0.036189318
going to be nominated for Best Supporting Actress for playing the mother I mean the,0.03685184
scenes with the two of them together they are the funniest and the most genuine,0.049924027
in the film if anything I kind of wish there was a little more development,0.062736794
and a little bit more scenes with her and her mom although I know that's,0.20682089
not realistic to teenage life you're not really with your mom all the time so,0.2451136
I just think that they are wonderful together and Ronan has said that Lady Bird,0.059603114
is a mixture of Greta Gerwig life with you know a lot of Ronan's input,0.054714017
as well and she creates a character that is just flawed but beautiful at the,0.05311425
same time am she really is trying to navigate herself and figure out who she,0.03449975
is so she's at that point in life where a lot of teenagers will just,0.06057495
almost try on different personalities to see which one they are because they're not really,0.03269178
sure which personality they are and you see her navigate her life through the theatre,0.05712065
group and then the rich-kid group and she's trying to figure out exactly who she,0.064095765
is and I think a lot of people although not myself are going to find,0.0924725
you know the relationship between the mother and the daughter so relatable they have such,0.10880875
difficulty trying to communicate but you know that they love each other and that with,0.014254886
the mother everything she's doing is because she loves her daughter but she certainly comes,0.121811755
across as smothering and overbearing and you know constantly barging in on her and you,0.0999179
know I think a lot of people are going to relate to that relationship and,0.015212085
I love that Ronan never takes that character and just makes her an angsty teenager,0.097028345
there are a lot of layers layers to her and she really reflects on who,0.048794545
she is and that is very realistic two teenagers believe me I'm with them all,0.058817532
day long they do stop and they think about how they behaved and they'll reflect,0.08205972
and they know they want to change sometimes and they're not just sure they're not,0.0298428
so sure how and I found that you know a lot of the aspects of,0.012467537
her character are incredibly realistic so you know the performances they are phenomenal now I'll,0.030247895
be honest I am not the biggest fan of Greta Gerwig I've never really liked,0.035856724
her very much in films even if I like the film I'm not a week,0.049788997
crazy about her she sort of comes off as such a hipster and like she's,0.32475042
trying to be overly cool and and trying to always fit in with the cool,0.040580194
kids and I thought Francis ha was one of the most overrated movies I found,0.04589767
it just painful to watch but really with Gerwig behind the camera she's proven that,0.06416561
she certainly understands how to capture a foundational moment in life I'm now at a,0.06580396
point that I'm really excited to see what Greta Gerwig is going to do in,0.039466012
the future I feel like she has definitely found where she belongs being behind the,0.038005933
camera she knows what she's doing as a director she certainly understands tone she really,0.06385364
understands character development I think she's an even a writer that's really where her niche,0.105238706
is she is a phenomenal writer so I really am happy to see where she's,0.032245442
gonna go in the future and I can say that now I actually like Greta,0.030339692
Gerwig so I just want to add that I know this movie won best picture,0.020467035
for the new the New York Film Critics Circle awards and I don't think that,0.034073368
this is the best picture of the year at all I could think of like,0.014075951
six films that were definitely better than this film in terms of story character development,0.040203698
meaning and I haven't even seen all of the heavy hitters yet so you know,0.035625905
I cannot wait to see the shape of water I can't wait to see three,0.037972674
billboards outside Epping Missouri that I'm gonna see next week and do a review and,0.09847778
I still haven't seen mud bound so they're still you know a few films coming,0.07983334
out that I have even higher hopes for I'm not saying that Lady Bird is,0.039658915
bad and it doesn't deserve this attention I just don't necessarily think that this is,0.050492097
the best but if I look back to last year and everyone was ranting and,0.0314113
raving about the edge of seventeen well this movie definitely runs circles around that movie,0.056115557
it is you know without a doubt the better of the coming-of-age stories but I'm,0.038578656
never going to say that a coming-of-age story is the best film of the year,0.019223142
but you know this is the best you can get within that storyline and now,0.014596125
for the green so first film and artistry if I'm looking at Lady Bird as,0.032007974
just a straight-up drama with comedic elements then I would have to give it an,0.08875279
A - their performances are outstanding the writing is stellar although I do feel like,0.017918052
it lacked some of the filmic elements that I'm looking for there's not as much,0.07403893
artistry the music didn't really tie everything together for me which is another thing that,0.025528418
I look for so it was really great for what it was but like I,0.036395524
said I'm never gonna look at a coming-of-age story as you know the greatest now,0.0328175
if I'm just reading this at the coming a story I would definitely give it,0.019237775
an a it's one of the best examples you'll ever find but I don't know,0.033287786
if I would put it in such a small category as that so in terms,0.06526449
of watchability I would give ladybird and a - I really enjoyed it but it's,0.07458305
not the kind of movie that I think I'll go back and watch again and,0.06357027
again everyone else I feel like has a real sense of connection to this movie,0.02626278
which is why they are going nuts over it but I found that my adolescent,0.13897881
years I didn't really connect to this character so much my family my friends they've,0.01749566
always joked around and made fun of me because they thought that I acted like,0.029800892
this adult from the time I was basically a kid and that in my teenage,0.16699302
years I didn't really act anything like a teenager my mom still talks about how,0.05692575
I never really acted like a teenager so it was hard for me to relate,0.041229412
to what she was going through and that's kind of like moving through friend groups,0.043139156
I just didn't experience that but that's because I'm just straight-up weird I also didn't,0.04225446
connect the relationship with her and her mother the relationship that I had and have,0.050957058
with my mom isn't anything like that you know in the movie the characters really,0.065582454
controlling my mom's not controlling at all she was always really proud of me growing,0.092556976
up so I just I didn't have that same sense of connection that I think,0.021844631
some people are having when they're watching this movie almost you know seeing that wow,0.027495366
this is my wife and this is what I went through what I I'm not,0.043452457
really I didn't have that experience watching this film but I did really like it,0.025745267
so with that said please leave a comment below if you if you saw ladybird,0.10463538
