what is happening Magnus sites remember to come out and see me November 11th in Times Square New York City for the urban action showcase and Expo link for the tickets is in the description box and do not forget to use the promo code magnesite Thor Ragnarok what is happening mega sites so I just got back from lunch and Thor Ragnarok and I gotta say I already know you know all hanging on my words you want to know the tyrone love it or did he hate I thought that this movie did a very very good job of mixing humor with the action I thought the humor was done very well and I thought the action was done very well I mean the surprised me especially in that first scene I was like whoa okay okay cuz it started out just joke after joke after joke didn't got into the fight I was like okay okay things got going I was like alright so you don't know basically this movie is about Thor trying to stop Ragnarok and his sister hella from taking over Asgard and it follows his adventures from being lost from the Bifrost and landing on some planet where apparently a bunch of junk always goes and The Devil's anus is also there you um and he runs into his friend from work the Hulk and I gotta say the Hulk who was done very well the CGI on the Hulk the detail and just his mannerisms the way he talked everything about the Hulk I really I really liked I really liked you'll find that they mix some Planet Hulk stuff in there and it was cool man it was cool I forgot the actor's name that does the Hulk but he did a real good job just playing Banner it was a fun movie it was a fun movie and Ty I'm gonna buy this on blu-ray when it does come out hella was great I know that usually Marvel films don't have to be any great villains I thought her after Loki it's probably their best villain I really like the Winter Soldier though I did like you but hella stands out hella stands out she does and she is not to be with trust me when I tell you and the previews actually hide some things that happen in the movie you what we get in the previews it's different than what you see in the movie you will see the exact same scene in the movie but it's different other things are added to it I don't know spoil it you get limbs ham um I thought everybody did a great job Jeff Goldblum was funny as hell and everybody was good man and you know for 80% improv movie and for a movie that's about a serious ass god you know they pulled it off I didn't expect it but I went in with a clean slate I said okay let's see what they do and they knocked it out of the park I've really I've really liked it I did I like to the lot y'all there are only a few scenes were always like you know we do not track but other than really that I'm gonna I'm gonna give Thor this was the best Thor out of all of them so far this was the best Thor movie okay best Thor movie I'm gonna give this a solid 4 out of 5 rules not I'm not exactly sure I can't give it a perfect it's not a perfect movie but it's definitely a 4 out of 5 which is viable and blu-ray which is worth going to see again I saw it in IMAX 2 day I saw in the credits they said something about 3d crit 3d something else like this well is it in 3d is he showing in 3d somewhere I better look it up cuz I'm willing to go see it again in 3d I don't usually like to go see movies twice you see what I'm saying this is a movie I will go see twice I've really did like this movie I've really enjoyed myself so spoiler time or mullet time did you see man Thor was up in the beginning of that movie the way he was spinning the hammer taking out the way he was spinning it and like deflected in the fire oh yeah yeah I was impressed with these fight scenes man I really was impressed with the fight scenes so couple of things that they they fooled us on was with the fight with with Hulk he came out on with that lightning uppercut I was like whoa and every scene you just see him coming in with uppercut that ain't the damn deal and then the fact that Thor actually lost his eye tella I didn't expect that to happen so when he landed and he was all full lightning in the preview yet both eyes he doesn't have both eyes in the movie doesn't have both eyes in the movie man I see well as spoilers can we talk about you know the instinct credit scene um the first one I could see they were it looked like they were running in the fan of the ship it looked very similar to the one that was his son was in in guardians of galaxy and then the last scene it just seemed almost like a throwaway it seemed like a throwaway scene just you know just had some funny  at the end of the movie with Jeff Goldblum it may have been something that I didn't catch or pick up but that's you know that's what I saw I actually thought Hulk was gonna defeat that god but from the way they had it in the in the previews but uh here I'll tell now now for what don't smash oh man hope was living like a king kinda wasn't he had all those women was in the  hot tub winner in necklaces chillin he was a lot smarter in this one which I don't you know which is weird you know every other time that they let him loose in the Avengers movies he was I would say yeah I would say he was he's twice as smart as he is in this one then he was in other movies all the movies he just filled scene filled with rage and didn't talk much at all buttoned that's when he talks he has full conversations you know I don't know why that is I couldn't move changes where it just is what it is you know I mean why the hell is hell is so powerful why the hell is hella so powerful I I guess cuz she's the firstborn of Odin's and I guess maybe it just would go and order to Thor being less powerful than her but on actress epilator did a good job and I just really think that hell it is a really good villain you know the same found out that the one the black chick is a Valkyrie and then once we call him there looking like I do from the x-men it's yourself--i the sidekicks were funny sidekicks were funny you know the guys that he met while he was hitting on the battle arena thing I'm trying to think of all the spoilers I can talk about with you guys but you know it's like I just saw it so you know I'm like racking my brain trying to think of different things with you a lot of people thought we were gonna see the guardians of the galaxy in this and of course we don't see them unless I missed something I'm when I got up and went to the bathroom once that was when they were cutting Thor's hair so I could miss something I guess that's about it y'all yeah I guess that's about it great
