i can't remember any of them off,0.08822227

my head a leader valley valley,0.07008682
i don't know this actress and the sublime orson welles wells hasn't been in that many films but he is such a charismatic,0.21900265
actor every time,0.08438086
he's on the screen he just steals it from everyone else in my opinion,0.37094665
the story is about an impoverished author played by joseph cotton who is invited to vienna to do some work for his friend,0.14924935
harry lyme when he arrives in vienna he learns that his friend has been killed and he is told that in fact his friend is a racketeer cotton is outraged that his friend is considered a criminal,0.4005489
so he starts to investigate harry lime's death,0.26489785
that is the basic plot,0.12227394
i'm not telling you anything else because this film takes place in post-war vienna,0.25352782
it is quite haunting,0.08675793
actually it is a sad place a tragic place that is trying to pick up the pieces after a devastating war,0.15400663
and i thought it was beautifully shot,0.29132712
it showed the decay it showed all the devastation that had taken place in this city,0.15283057
and as a backdrop to the story it was perfect,0.08936467
it was an indication of the corruption or decay in humanity as well well that was my feeling anyway,0.19470273
the cinematography is superb the shots are all off kilter,0.28419912
they're not always level and that just adds to the mystery of the story because that's what this is this is a mystery that joseph cotton is trying to unravel it is very atmospheric,0.08884636
it is menacing at times there is so much going on all the time that i think this is a film that you need to view over and over again,0.10621419
i've only ever seen it once,0.09089806
i thought perhaps i might have seen it,0.058723535
when i was younger but i can't recall it perhaps,0.03845677
it's been a long time and i've watched a lot of films in my life but i did watch it recently and i thought this is definitely something i want to see again because i'm sure i would have missed something there are so many twists and turns to the plot that you don't know where it's heading,0.10731813
it reminded me very much of hitchcock films,0.39844698
so i loved it just for that,0.05944841
but this film has this haunting sadness to it,0.1235696
i found it quite depressing at times just realizing what all these people might have gone through as a result of the war for me this film had a profound impact,0.22846055
it showed very clearly the destruction that wars can cause us not just physically to the buildings but also to the people themselves i definitely got the feeling that this was a subtle anti-war film the script is excellent,0.063147984
it really is not a predictable story,0.05089326
i certainly didn't know what was happening,0.081221476
and i never knew who was a good guy and who wasn't a good guy except for our main character played by joseph cotton he is naive and quite innocent,0.2786904
actually whereas everyone else seemed world weary expecting the worst from people and usually finding out it is a beautifully,0.18337102
done film,0.08796049
i cannot say enough good things about the film i thought the cinematography was spectacular,0.104080066
i loved all the unusual angles that the director used it highlighted the sinister atmosphere the actual menace that you felt the uncertainty the danger the acting also was top notch,0.12355755
and of course special mention has to go to orson welles who is hardly on screen and yet dominates the entire film,0.069155924
he really does he's just so good in this that it's worth watching just for awesome wells but that is not to take away from the rest of the cast the vulnerability of harry lime's lover or the innocence of the american writer joseph cotton or the cynicism of the british soldier,0.28066
terence,0.09679739
howard everyone was convincing and believable the acting was superb this isn't just a film about the visuals or the plot,0.0584164
it was also about the acting,0.056289516
you definitely needed good acting to carry this story off and it's succeeded,0.087055564
i loved this film i could not predict,0.114470035
what happened,0.05228998
i was completely entranced,0.085509606
i think it is so beautifully done,0.09072465
i love the cinematography the atmosphere i love the acting there is no criticisms,0.09170408
i have to make of this film i highly recommend the third man for anyone who loves filmoire who loves atmospheric and unpredictable films who loves superb acting who loves hitchcock films because it is definitely reminiscent of a hitchcock film and yet i would say this is even darker,0.31252563
yeah i would say that it is a lot darker,0.07513956
