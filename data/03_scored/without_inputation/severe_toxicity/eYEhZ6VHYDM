is quite unexpected I think what are these noises with the lobster and sacred deer,0.03393634
you could say that they break conventions quite a bit they're really wacky and strange,0.17902154
and have a very weird story and very strange and off characters you can say,0.019454626
the same here but the story is somewhat more accessible being a period drama of,0.013630278

best performance for me without a doubt is Olivia Colman it's actually been amazing to,0.07586885
see how she's got to this point just from being lovely Sophie on Peep Show,0.032685794
to Tyrannosaur where she was unbelievably brilliant and honestly oscar-worthy as well even more so,0.07767749
than this role I would say and now to the point where she's actually a,0.02968515
contender to win an Oscar I'm actually really proud of her for getting to this,0.060235705

little bit and there's some historical experts who say that it's not all entirely true,0.027076965
some of it just kind of goes off rumors that circled around the place at,0.024410244

or low down or a fisheye or not a fisheye it's really quite disorientating I,0.029728388
think I quite loved it for that the characters are what really make the film,0.018493436
work in the long run it's sort of a power play type story and it's,0.013730721
great because you never really know what any given person's motives are there's barely a,0.07005182
moment alone with each character so you don't really get to see what their end,0.016681476
