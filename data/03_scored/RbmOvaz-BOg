from the far reaches of the milky way galaxy it's retro nerd girl with a,0.5154597
film review for you today i'll be reviewing the movie the wizard of oz released,0.11916691
in 1939. starring judy garland frank morgan and ray bolger directed by victor fleming the,0.046622157
synopsis is a young farm girl in kansas is transported to the land of oz,0.22503625
and receives help from unusual friends to get back home the story this film is,0.03937946
an adaptation of the famous 1900s children's book the wonderful wizard of oz by l,0.18361183
frank baum the author was inspired to write the story after a trip in 1890,0.08424017
where he witnessed a cyclone in aberdeen south dakota and around the same time his,0.0921423
wife's niece dorothy had passed away the name for oz was chosen at a glance,0.22971195
at his filing cabinet where he saw a through n and o through z the,0.19227959
idea for the story closely resembles alice in wonderland written by lewis carroll about a,0.0941262
young girl traveling to a strange fantasy land in 1902 a broadway musical inspired bomb,0.24256141
to write 13 sequels to the book two short films were made in 1910 the,0.07318105
wonderful wizard of oz and the land of oz then there was a feature film,0.061697282
patchwork girl of oz in 1914 the wizard of oz in 1925 and its sequel,0.23916094
the land of oz in 1932. the rights changed hands from samuel goldwyn to mgm,0.042612605
in 1934 and although at the time the studio was looking into making a film,0.10986676
with a few stars it wasn't until 1937 that the rights were put to use,0.061504897
as it was trying to replicate the success of disney's snow white and the seven,0.13041295
dwarfs released that year in 1937. now speaking of disney disney also wanted to make,0.056993816
the wizard of oz would later go on to make the return to oz which,0.064523645
was released many years later in 1985 the muppets wizard of oz released in 2005,0.06972056
and as the great powerful released in 2013. in fact there was a short time,0.019618036
that mgm and disney discussed possibly combining forces to make a film but that didn't,0.027687259
quite work out so can you believe that it took 14 writers along with the,0.05554338
actors and directors to help write the script that's pretty incredible we've seen so many,0.05440444
cases where there are too many cooks in the kitchen that could sour the meal,0.12388329
but in this case it works and perhaps it was because it was a collaborative,0.08678391
effort by people who were vastly familiar with the book and wanted to do it,0.03867067
justice the greatest inspiration came from the book but there were a few things about,0.06919759
the book that the film couldn't do because it was a movie and there was,0.056892946
only a certain amount of time to tell the story for instance in the book,0.037575904
dorothy encounters the field mice the hammerheads the dainty china country and the country of,0.24047597
the quadlings just to name a few the characters were condensed to make the story,0.06317068
more palatable which i thought was an excellent choice it really makes the story a,0.028800413
little more snappier getting to the point of the adventure dorothy's slippers were originally silver,0.0877216
in the book but the studio realized that the technicolor production would benefit from the,0.05552398
slippers being bolder in color so that it stood out they chose red but by,0.08460947
calling it ruby slippers it had more of a magical effect another part of the,0.053833775
story that had to be curtailed was the amount of violence that was permitted to,0.12280613
be shown in 1939 for instance in the book the wizard commands the group to,0.023790104
actually kill the wicked witch and not just get her broomstick the film borrowed ideas,0.78178334
from the wizard of oz version in 1925 by using the farmhands in kansas as,0.0547845
symbolic characters and oz and this is actually a way that it helped to tell,0.034414675
the story better i rather liked most of the differences in the film and it's,0.04140544
basically you know really well put together until about the end where there's a few,0.089103766
things that kind of fall apart for me actually since now watching it as an,0.08570593
adult the dialogue is very dated but appropriate for this fun light-hearted story somehow it's,0.061181728
been cherished decades after decades making it timeless in a way the pacing in an,0.05416645
hour and 42 minutes it's pretty good no complaints for me it always gets a,0.08470278
bit murky once the quartet assembles and especially slows down after the group meets the,0.11963846
wizard for the first time but generally i don't have much to complain about the,0.06351603
flow of the film the challenge the challenge in this story seems to be obviously,0.049368937
the main wicked witch of the west and her real world counterpart miss elmira gulch,0.7682922
and i agree that she is a challenge but i also feel as if this,0.058204487
challenge is part of a bigger problem for our protagonists coming of age at the,0.108650014
start of the film elmira has an order to take dorothy's dog toto because he,0.17221022
keeps terrorizing her and chasing her cat he even bit her elmira is not just,0.401783
mad at dorothy because she's mean she has had enough and as a kid watching,0.28779963
this film i never noticed that elmira was actually sounding off real complaints about dorothy,0.16468441
and her lack of responsibility towards toto and that was because i was completely distracted,0.17918685
by her mean approach i really feel bad about that because technically elmira is in,0.15340783
the right here so much so that dorothy's aunt and couldn't really stop elmira from,0.10683229
taking toto away well let's get into it a little deeper after watching and reading,0.14934546
many reviews about this film a lot of people think that dorothy wants to leave,0.08731266
kansas because the grass is greener out there but that's not true because she likes,0.1573564
it in kansas but she's completely out of place no one listens to her and,0.16686057
she seems to be in everyone's way it's to the point that any m actually,0.08454025
says find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble and that is,0.09913574
when she sings the iconic song somewhere over the rainbow longing to find a place,0.12621236
where dreams really do come true and all this happens before elmira even enters the,0.098982856
film so ultimately dorothy runs away from home to save toto from mrs gulch when,0.10008856
she learns that her aunt and uncle will be heartbroken it is then that love,0.1341908
brings her home to face her problems and she has had a big change of,0.14976232
heart right at the beginning of the film now if you notice the cyclone happens,0.050906386
right after dorothy is on her way back home symbolizing her internal shift turning her,0.11420529
perception of the world upside down after yearning for a world without any trouble dorothy,0.15021563
finds herself in a whole lot more trouble once she arrives on oz the grass,0.14932777
is not always greener and running away from one's problems can cause more of them,0.05302666
these are the lessons that dorothy is learning but let's get back to the obvious,0.052942872
challenge of the wicked witch of the west the wicked witch after hearing that dorothy,0.7403571
killed her sister is irate and i would say that would be a very natural,0.88824683
response anyone would be traumatized by this and angry when the wicked witch tries to,0.53069514
take her sister's ruby slipper which are rightfully hers to decide what to do with,0.14452323
possibly a sentimental value they're actually taken away and put on her sister's killer's feet,0.58108443
wow that that's really messed up there's been a terrible injustice that has been done,0.104110636
to her i think that you know when i was a kid i i was,0.1259353
so distracted by the physical representation of what the film says is good or wicked,0.21666415
and i did not see how wrong our protagonists are but one great difference in,0.060792238
this film and the book is the depth that they give the wicked witch and,0.6754887
as a villain she is very impressive and one of the most iconic villains of,0.2408899
pop culture now the empathy one thing that we get from this film is that,0.10883003
we get incredible likeable characters as much as dorothy may be irresponsible with toto oh,0.14919385
she's just so adorable and incredibly likable you really instantly just take her side you,0.44288883
just you just want her to find her rainbow right her character arc actually happens,0.10688614
in the beginning of the film when she chooses to go back to the farm,0.08508167
and face her problems but the lesson isn't over from her experience she is having,0.12971625
sort of a revelation within she seems to have an actual physical look of shock,0.14868598
throughout the entire film as we are witnessing dorothy's internal awe-inspiring change and most of,0.053396594
all dorothy represents the innocence in us all and at one point another in our,0.041710902
lives when we decide to be better human beings than we once were and i,0.31000903
think of the friends that dorothy encounters in oz are really symbolic representations are the,0.051581092
things that dorothy needs in order to face reality like logic love or otherwise compassion,0.10185399
for others and most of all courage to do the right thing and once over,0.06625992
these things are already in her ability the scarecrow is a man made out of,0.3239279
straw and the first friend that she meets he is stuck upon a pole as,0.30872175
dorothy has been stuck in her way of thinking i believe that the scarecrow who,0.26935425
seeks a brain was to show how important critical thinking is using logic and common,0.35167387
sense can help a person deal with many daily problems the real world version of,0.07761361
the scarecrow hunk tells dorothy that she should use her head about mrs gulch and,0.3690586
not walk past her house on the way home so toto wouldn't get in trouble,0.09335207
and really that makes a whole lot of sense the tin man is an extremely,0.18227752
mild-mannered and consider it tin woodman abandoned in the forest he is the symbol of,0.13209346
compassion as he desires a physical representation of that in a heart he is the,0.06140797
compassion that dorothy needs to be considerate of other people dorothy didn't really take in,0.053483088
consideration that she might be causing elmira some distress over her cat and her property,0.14864835
the cowardly lion is probably one of the most sympathetic characters of all time but,0.44690475
he's full of comedic moments you either feel sorry for him or despise him but,0.15801
either way his reaction to problems is a lot like dorothy's when she decides to,0.08773386
run away from the farm instead of facing them the cowardly lion is pretty cowardly,0.63709265
and hardly gets a chance to show that he has any courage at all but,0.07669638
there is a scene in which it's time to save dorothy from the wicked witch,0.5631765
and the scarecrow tells him that he has to be the one to lead them,0.26303703
sort of like your mental skills as a person near your logic telling yourself hey,0.72193944
you've got to do this one thing and in response the lion says he'll do,0.0645299
it for dorothy so when pushed against the wall courage kicks in when the wizard,0.20428245
of oz gives the cowardly lion a badge of honor at the end of the,0.46758842
film he tells him that he has the wisdom to know when to face danger,0.12707445
or to run away this is a very valuable attribute that dorothy needs when she,0.105483785
goes back home to kansas the friends that dorothy meet are seeking things that they,0.046719283
already have inside them just as dorothy already has all of these attributes inside of,0.17676483
her and now all she has to do is recognize them and use them now,0.10939725
the technical aspects it actually took five directors to make this film with victor fleming,0.069918744
taking the main credit for the final product during the filming there were several replaced,0.056118764
actors and changes in the look of the characters seeing some of the pictures really,0.03917335
make you wonder how the film would have been seeing these iconic characters and their,0.054487146
potential alternative costumes it just proves how very important it is to get the costuming,0.08227195
just right because it is one of the most outstanding results that make the film,0.04425587
so captivating the work done for the costumes and makeup really hold up over time,0.08104143
and it's truly remarkable as there is so much emphasis on getting things truly right,0.05950922
in many scenes dorothy's hair appears to be at different lengths due to the costumed,0.08152794
switches and many of the scenes were re-shot several times the witch was originally just,0.32303455
to look like an appealing modern woman however to stick more closely to the book,0.31151986
the filmmakers decided to make the witch look more sinister with exaggerated features and i,0.47206318
especially liked the idea of putting her hair back in a bun the green makeup,0.3299212
was a wonderful touch that was absolutely exquisitely done the prosthetics used for the wicked,0.37162685
witch was actually also very well done for 1938 and nearly undetectable in some scenes,0.36148378
the actors unfortunately had to suffer quite a bit for their costume work as well,0.29084924
as some actors we didn't even get to see on screen more commonly known the,0.059568044
tig man was originally to be played by buddy epson who was well into the,0.14510973
production having recorded music and filled much of the tin man scenes until he fell,0.17931318
ill due to an allergic reaction to the makeup that was used for the character,0.09041555
real lion skin and fur was used to make the cowardly lions costume to give,0.2734419
it an authentic look which was heavy and extremely hot so you can imagine that,0.19335197
the combination of dead animals and sweat made that costume really stinky mgm recruited extra,0.53490317
help from the studio mail room and courier service to become makeup artists each recruit,0.10439927
was instructed in one area of prosthetic application for an assembly line process each morning,0.035788953
one interesting thing that happened was that the wardrobe department accidentally chose a coat for,0.051469248
professor marvel from a second hand store which turned out to have a label indicating,0.07564961
that the coat had been made for the late al frank bomb there are a,0.19760759
lot of creative hacks on this film to pull off unique visual feats the horses,0.15290268
in the mrl city palace were colored with jello crystals so you can actually see,0.12331645
the horses lick it off in a few scenes the famous surrender dorothy skywriting scene,0.4875339
was done using a tank of water and a tiny model of the witch very,0.4031407
creative the tornado was a 35 foot long muslin stocking spun around the look is,0.12641487
very impressive the shot of dorothy's house falling from the sky was a reverse shot,0.18193477
of a miniature house being dropped onto a painting of the sky i think that's,0.08799867
completely genius the sets gloriously bask in all of its colorful splendor exploring this fantasy,0.22081153
world with great creativity these were all decorated sound stages but that's part of the,0.15274028
charm it's almost as if we're flipping through the pages of the book and looking,0.08580575
at those beautiful imaginative illustrations ey harburg and harold arlen were given 14 weeks to,0.16835028
come up with the film's musical score and it is truly a classic and you,0.061330054
you absolutely know it when you hear it and you can't help singing along to,0.10630894
the songs the song over the rainbow was nearly cut from the film can you,0.07112184
believe that it won an oscar for best music original song and this was judy,0.06658749
garland's signature song until her passing it was also ranked number one by the american,0.13079467
film institute in 2004 on the 100 greatest songs in america's films list as well,0.048332296
as re-recorded by several musical artists performances to me the performances were fantastic because the,0.03482497
actors are acting the way that they were instructed to and this is a stylized,0.054140635
form of acting of overacting actually specifically to appeal to the children of 1939 it's,0.090945944
all a part of america's wholesome image at the time now does the acting hold,0.086579815
up yes and no we know it's corny and it's actually part of the reason,0.3076794
why the film is so entertaining endearing and dare i say magical it just wouldn't,0.09775873
be as bewitching if it were acted differently it would probably be i mean i,0.08136095
would have to say it would probably be really boring it wouldn't be as fun,0.13280374
and julie garland was wonderful as dorothy though she's not wearing a visually cumbersome costume,0.35893884
she actually suffered a lot for the role having to wear a very painful corset,0.39171958
around her torso to look more like a pre-adolescent child and the beautiful ruby slippers,0.28141627
were rumored to be quite torturous to wear frank morgan was incredible playing the role,0.05726605
of professor marvel the wizard of oz the gatekeeper the carriage driver and the guard,0.060354594
he plays all of the parts very jolly and boisterous with a chameleon charm ray,0.24231978
bulger played hulk and the scarecrow excellently putting his fabulous acrobatic dancing skills on show,0.34070882
rey said later in interviews that the rubber prosthetic that he had to wear on,0.13136679
his face that mimicked a woven pattern actually left lines on his face that took,0.40336314
more than a year to vanish bert lahr as zeke and the cowardly lion was,0.5154597
great having so much great delivery of his comedic dialogue uh he brings forth many,0.07192509
of the most funniest and endearing moments of comedy in the film jack haley was,0.027603034
fantastic as hickory and the tin man he manipulated his voice while playing the tin,0.31089434
man saying that he felt that the tone should be soft something like the way,0.09111115
he would read a bedtime story to his son it was a wonderful decision as,0.07038792
you really get the sense of how compassionate and sensitive his character is in the,0.095196985
film one of the biggest standouts in this is margaret hamilton playing mrs gulch and,0.12894553
the wicked witch of the west her iconic performance is the only way that you,0.7296028
can put you can call it it's just iconic was so thrilling and memorable that,0.07986842
it's been copied quoted and obsessed about through the decades margaret hamilton said that her,0.12019574
approach to the character was that the wicked witch was a person who relished everything,0.5154597
she did but who ultimately was a sad lonely figure a woman who lived in,0.19273673
constant frustration and she never got what she wanted and you really get the sense,0.24668148
of that from her performance the film was also very popular for the over 100,0.04103711
little people who would make up the citizens of munchkinland as a kid seeing them,0.45520926
was a very magical experience i mean i just wanted to live in munchkin land,0.19815853
because everything there was so happy and lively and you know their performance was such,0.060382113
a big part of the nostalgic enchantment of the film and paved the way for,0.027913833
so many actors of short stature the best part of the film the whole thing,0.063281365
i just love this movie so much and i find the the i find it,0.09336775
so very amazing and fun i i enjoy myself every time i and i specifically,0.0972931
cry at the scene where dorothy is singing the song over the rainbow i it's,0.09116798
a guarantee every single time the ending the ending wraps up pretty quickly but it,0.11011066
works for me mad tv spoofed the ending and asked the same question of many,0.15069295
of the fans who wondered about the good witch glinda why didn't she tell dorothy,0.31089434
how to get home as soon as she put on those ruby slippers but i,0.11765969
think that the biggest problem here is that that the good witch glinda is actually,0.32620355
a combination of the good witch of the north and the good witch of the,0.41296497
south and if they were two different characters i believe it would have made more,0.07642075
sense as a storytelling piece my wish list sadly many of the wicked witch of,0.6046057
the west's scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely because they were deemed too frightening,0.15318744
for audiences but i would have loved to have seen them because those critics who,0.11010362
say that the wicked witch is more bark than bite i am hoping that those,0.6184866
clips would have changed their minds perhaps this was also part of the symbolism so,0.045681603
and the wicked witch isn't really a very hard challenge for the group so in,0.6316716
a way the wicked witch really stands for a challenge that really seems like it's,0.5876557
much bigger and harder to get over than it is nonetheless i would love to,0.089878924
have seen those scenes where she's a little nastier and uh moreover it seems like,0.61523783
the whole thing really wraps up really fast at the end it could have used,0.052801967
about five more minutes of storytelling my enjoyment i like so many other people grew,0.10375587
up seeing the wizard of oz at least once or twice a year since i,0.059400313
was a kid and it's really filled me with a great deal of wonder about,0.10892745
dorothy and this land of oz i've read the books and i've read different adaptations,0.06975349
i've seen so many different adaptations on film and it's just something that's still very,0.0720779
the only word i could think of to describe this is magical i think i,0.07365765
may have used that word at least six or seven times maybe eight more times,0.05382496
in this video but it's truly the only word i could think of to really,0.11426947
describe this movie it still has that same feeling for me every time i watch,0.08517533
this film it's still there and that's what really makes it a classic the film,0.10240055
wasn't a big hit at the box office though uh when it came out 44,0.18126522
million people tuned in to see its first television broadcast on november 3rd 1956 and,0.07581839
aired every single year often on easter sunday on cbs for nearly 40 years according,0.13005681
to the library of congress the wizard of oz is the most watched film ever,0.06918947
and this is one thing most of us have in common with each other at,0.08126435
least at one point or another most of us have seen this there's no place,0.06859198
like home is the last mantra that the film instills in to its viewers leaving,0.03645578
many with the idea that dorothy learns not to venture out into the world but,0.058992352
to love it right at home i think that doesn't really make a lot of,0.07766694
sense because it doesn't tie into her change of heart just before the cyclone takes,0.067139536
her to us instead and this is just my point of view i believe that,0.05980758
dorothy learns how to use her logic and how to love and to have courage,0.09439068
in order to deal with her real life circumstances at home and she needs not,0.1840221
seek happiness anywhere else if she can't have it at home and i kind of,0.13515656
really love that message because it's it's about being an individual wherever you are bringing,0.1133155
with you the the upbringing that your family has taught you and bringing with you,0.2584675
your standards and and your sense of self wherever you go so no matter where,0.6048164
you are you're always at home my rating is a 9.5 well that sums up,0.10435604
my review this is retro nerd girl signing off take care movie lovers i'm off,0.5876557
