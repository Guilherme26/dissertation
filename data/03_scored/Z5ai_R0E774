hello this review is going to be ever so slightly different to my typical reviews,0.07653084
not that there's going to be any drastic changes to the format and honestly surface,0.045558825
level it won't be noticeably different at all it's more of a behind the scenes,0.15315263
difference there's two things that i usually do before shooting these movie reviews and it's,0.31089434
one i'll re-watch or watch for the first time the movie and then two i'll,0.07556258
do like bullet point notes i don't write a script for the reviews i don't,0.14872845
think i read scripts too well i think i start to sound too robotic and,0.0865501
clunky i find it just easier to kind of shoot from the hip so to,0.67051417
speak but i do have like a list of notes that i read from and,0.07168246
read off of just to make sure i don't forget any points or anything i,0.13335246
wanted to talk about and i decided not to do that for this review of,0.07211485
seven samurai uh the 1954 akira kurosawa masterpiece and the reason i decided not to,0.10294244
do that is because of the relationship i have with the film i don't watch,0.0732493
it super regularly i think i've maybe only seen it three or four times i,0.065485194
watch it sparsely because it feels kind of like an event and like a ritual,0.18017554
whenever i watch it and i thought to re-watch it with the intent of reviewing,0.10905581
it might spoil that you know almost religious ritual aspect that i have with the,0.09784507
film uh and i really wanted to avoid that because sometimes that happens and it,0.12618542
doesn't happen all the time but i thought with a three-hour movie where i have,0.055776734
preemptively decided to watch it with the intent of reviewing it i was kind of,0.07597484
worried that i might start to be too critical and dampen my experience maybe i,0.06246675
wouldn't have i don't know i just didn't want to take the risk but i,0.06092418
think that akira kurosawa seven samurai very well might be the greatest film ever made,0.0721477
i don't know if it's my favorite movie but when i just think of a,0.0677599
movie that artistically and i sound like such a douchebag saying that but a movie,0.76837975
that you know just the craftsmanship left me in such awe and left me both,0.08493639
intimidated and infatuated with the genre with the art form uh you know like i,0.05272467
i just wanted to speak from the heart because i also part of my relationship,0.053355396
with seven samurais that i find myself quite frequently just kind of sitting around going,0.08035062
like man that's a good nlgger movie like it's great and so that's what i'm,0.38997054
doing here right now is i'm kind of just recording the thoughts that i have,0.06376067
about that movie every now and again it goes without saying that i recommend that,0.109709084
movie to anybody uh although i do find it to be a hard recommendation i,0.13386214
recommend it because i think so i recommend it because i think so highly of,0.07047882
it but it's an older japanese film so if you don't speak japanese you're going,0.28923196
to be reading subtitles uh and i know some people don't like reading subtitles it's,0.10246357
black and white and i know some people don't enjoy black and white films those,0.30974537
are two points that i find very unfortunate but are a reality um it's also,0.105524994
three hours long again another thing that isn't a problem for me but i realize,0.065923534
that some peop movie goers like their movies two hours or under and sometimes even,0.2033975
two hours is pushing it so with that in mind movie is beautiful the cinematography,0.14859757
is drop dead gorgeous the black and white is just jaw-dropping and the way that,0.1495735
it uses weather and music it's saw just compliments each other phenomenally the weather especially,0.055920348
every frame of painting which is a great youtube channel i don't think he's uploading,0.19047838
anymore but he does a great video on kirsawa's the movement of the kirasawa's films,0.15460514
akira kurosawa i kind of blurred mixed his name his name first and last name,0.14874788
together there um but it just heightens all the emotions that you're feeling and i,0.097142756
think that there's just something incredibly human about the story the desire to defend your,0.26204795
home mixed with a slightly higher concept of defending somebody else's home and being honorable,0.102895744
and doing the right thing and sacrifice and i think all those things are told,0.11607554
on such an emotional level that i don't think i've seen in another movie maybe,0.11214851
ever and a kind of a roundabout way of saying but it's just like when,0.064514294
you're in these battles there's these uh great battle scenes and for those of you,0.13001722
who don't know and again i'm sorry i'm rambling like i said i didn't take,0.12631702
my notes this is the inspiration the genesis of the magnificent seven where it's about,0.056999538
seven samurai who go to defend a village from bandits and so you have these,0.4261631
samurai and these villagers fighting to defend this village from these raiders and the emotions,0.089564875
that the characters are going through with the honor and respect and you know fighting,0.06443692
for dignity and fighting for their home and the water is just pouring from the,0.051458117
heavens and just drenching everything and they're scrambling through the mud uh it just it's,0.29257986
overwhelming to be honest it's it's a little bit overwhelming and you're sitting there in,0.14233124
awe and i find myself just lost in it and it's a three-hour movie but,0.094760865
i feel like i blink and it's over and i i don't want to make,0.10814346
it sound like this is just a wholly emotional experience in terms of drama it's,0.10556309
not just dramatic from start to finish i think the assembling of the team of,0.086933024
the seven samurai is incredibly fun and honestly one of the highlights of the movie,0.0871719
what am i saying the entire movie is a highlight i mentioned earlier that the,0.07717954
music coupled with the cinematography and the weather just helps heighten the emotions i couldn't,0.056690358
hum you a beat from it but i know that every time i'm listening to,0.1529457
it it's not a distraction it just feels right it just fits all the performances,0.0864626
are top notch the body language the physicality the emotion on people's faces is second,0.12134216
to none and then i could get into some more technical elements like the sound,0.12460022
design sound effects uh practical special effects set deck all of it's perfect and authentic,0.09086769
you don't look at anything and go that doesn't seem right or that doesn't sound,0.10691523
right which is i think probably for most moviegoers rare to begin with you're not,0.10805313
normally sitting there going like ah the fully artist didn't do too great a job,0.06652999
on dish one uh but in seven samurai it just all feels i don't want,0.12917471
to say like a documentary but it feels like you've just been dropped into the,0.15278454
world yeah it's a masterpiece when you're looking at it it's like being sucked into,0.6332485
feudal japan and the rest of the world just stops existing i strongly recommend watching,0.3680073
it on the biggest tv you can get taking the blinds down shutting off all,0.19727463
the lights getting your surround sound set up and if you don't have surround sound,0.09483707
just maxing out your tv's volume and just getting totally immersed in the movie i,0.14930451
think for the first time on this channel uh i'm giving a movie a perfect,0.15545426
