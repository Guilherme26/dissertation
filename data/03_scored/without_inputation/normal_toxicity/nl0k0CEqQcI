hey everybody today I am going to be reviewing portrait of a lady on fire,0.69542736
this film came out in 2019 it was written and directed by Celine Dion sciama,0.07776457
identifies very strongly as like a feminist artist and I think her movies really reflect,0.25662628
that notion a bit she makes movies that tend to be about women movies that,0.21170902
have to do with sexual identity and gender identity portrait of a lady on fire,0.63026327
seems to be her most ambitious film particularly aesthetically and the film has received a,0.15005167
lot of critical acclaim and it's considered an artistic triumph for me though admittedly I,0.04895968
I've struggled with my point of view on the film and I struggled with with,0.04714441
how I was going to do this review I did have to see it twice,0.09531413
so that I kind of solidified my opinions a little bit but I am still,0.102956
torn because the filmmaker and her point of view to me there are things about,0.07695114
her that I think are very nuanced and very interesting but then there are other,0.06083993
aspects of her point of view that I think Mar the sophistication of the images,0.083544776
and the ideas behind them and when you really admire somebody artistically that you think,0.14932889
has the ability to really go the full nine yards it kind of it becomes,0.094122574
frustrating and it makes it all the more frustrating that the film just wasn't quite,0.08908685
doing it for me I liked bits of it but as a whole it didn't,0.077905886
come together for me and my feelings on it are a little muddled I'm going,0.30039367
to start talking about the things that I like about the film because I don't,0.053180248
want to give people the impression that I like I hate this movie or anything,0.3264843
like that no I'm just frustrated a little bit but I do think that the,0.11658516
film touches on some very interesting ideas and the premise itself is a wonderful setup,0.09984275
used as the catalyst to propel a love story you have a protagonist at the,0.111385524
center name is Mary Ann and she looks strikingly like Emma Watson like to a,0.114460215
crazy degree at least that's what I thought but her features are a little bit,0.3588591
harder she's a little bit harsher cheekbones and jawline and I think that that works,0.46834308
really well for her character because her character is meant to be a very rebellious,0.10625844
artist who is defying conventions and you would consider her maybe a modern woman for,0.1851923
the time that this takes place and this is her story this is her retelling,0.14728644
the story about how she fell in love with her subject she is an artist,0.07713415
and she was paid to paint a wedding portrait of a woman that the woman's,0.31089434
name is Elouise and she is very alluring great to turn a mysterious person who,0.26798797
definitely rejects the idea of being married off to somebody that she doesn't know and,0.14923204
sending a portrait to see if you know he approves and you know naturally that's,0.07223372
understandable so while you're watching the film you can never really take it at a,0.16424961
literal level you always have to look at it as though it's being seen through,0.067269005
a distorted filter through the eyes of an unreliable narrator because the person telling the,0.14188108
story is telling it from the point of view of somebody who was in in,0.07414716
love it's like you know romance so therefore it's going to be heightened and she,0.15192713
is very creative and observant and all of those things are going to kind of,0.038803976
bleed in to the imagery the filmmaking really reflects this it's beautifully made film where,0.107655935
it depends on its own minimalistic approach as the crux of the the building tension,0.10803824
throughout especially the erotic tension building the relationship between these two women and this is,0.35625756
done very effectively with very interesting camera shots I really enjoy the scenes it's particularly,0.17973824
when Eloise is introduced and it's following her so her face is obscured all you,0.21576843
can see are her eyes but she's elusive and we are drawn to her because,0.19481906
of the way she's framed we were drawn to her in the same ways that,0.087523535
Marianne is drawn to her it uses a lot of empty space in the film,0.12139358
but I think that it that creates the mood and it heightens the sexuality the,0.31089434
film loves silence they love to take long pauses after a line is said and,0.1520812
things like that but yet at the same time even in the midst of those,0.0710127
silences there's always that fire underneath both metaphorically and literally because often you see you,0.1390144
know a fireplace in the distance and you can hear those those cracks and the,0.07633722
snaps of the fire which you know creates again more of that erotic tension the,0.48191047
first half of the film kind of has a slow build to it it really,0.07383141
takes its time but then the second half of the film it's kind of where,0.05263702
everything's blossoming it feels like everything is flourishing and that's where a lot of the,0.060199697
surrealism comes into play and I like that I like that Marianne is the one,0.06013763
telling the story because I think that that just adds another layer of complexity to,0.05991927
it it makes the ideas of love being heightened and distorted all of that a,0.08181556
compelling thesis or at least one aspect of the thesis yes there is that complicated,0.067623705
nature of romantic love and the immediacy of it being very visceral of course but,0.15539072
then they add this whole nother idea where we're look at it through memory the,0.08470327
perceptions of memory especially sensory memory when you're recalling a love story it's the sensory,0.0842933
moments that you tend to remember the most and I think in the case of,0.07602974
all kinds of love stories we often choose the memories other than reality because it's,0.036266275
easier we want to remember the person through our own filter through our own gaze,0.07615983
because it gives us that sort of control and that's also a really interesting idea,0.058835983
that you can tie into the filmmaking process in general because it mirrors that filmmaking,0.08834497
of course is a manipulative tool as I always say and its own right I,0.15911587
actually wish that that point had been brought into play more I think that would,0.056768347
have been very interesting and I sort of like Mulholland Drive sense there are images,0.099045016
in this film that reminded me a lot of mahon Drive especially you know the,0.075394616
profile shots where they're kind of overlapping in the beginning of the film Aloise refuses,0.15853064
to pose for the portrait so her mother tells Marian well could you just maybe,0.13719974
do it in secret so basically what Marian's having to do is she's having to,0.09142944
paint her just from memory and let me tell you that's ridiculously hard to do,0.40323535
I'm an artist myself and I don't I don't think I could do that I,0.10234364
have to have a subject I have to have a reference point to make it,0.042264886
seem realistic with shadows and the way that the light is hitting the face and,0.3074412
all of that is very difficult to recreate on your own it is a skill,0.24343635
that I wish that I had so props to Mary Ann that skill works in,0.075617224
the film because it's essential to the whole idea of what it means to perceive,0.074694015
a person the memory of a person as your feelings are changing for them compared,0.11376741
to the reality and how they would be if they were there in front of,0.06270281
you and that really can't affect your creative sensibilities and I think Mary Ann you,0.10664224
know she's becoming inspired artistically as the film is going so that point of view,0.071285315
is reflected through the film as I said it becomes more surrealistic and more kind,0.0770168
of beautiful and flourish as it goes art for her is a business she's there,0.111412935
to do a job but at the same time she's finding new ways to be,0.06803669
inspired and to improve through her relationship with the subject but in love it's never,0.08826446
about just one person I mean even in a love story if one person is,0.13309653
deeply in love with somebody who doesn't have the same feelings back it's still going,0.18305252
to affect both of them very deeply typically it's not just about the subject it's,0.0397171
how you see the subject and how you are translating and that's a very personal,0.1150234
thing I think and even somebody who does realistic portraits I'm as Merion does there's,0.100833364
a vulnerability to that and there's always a piece of the artistic thing in the,0.0919723
artwork especially as you grow older there's a moment that captured that for me pretty,0.13601774
early on it's when she puts on Mary Ann she puts on the green dress,0.09974186
that Eloise is supposed to be wearing when she poses for the portrait and because,0.10302756
I Louise is not there in the beginning of the film she puts it on,0.05743115
and has a mirror and she kind of sits in place just kind of so,0.10099035
there's a body there's a figure to work off of but also there's a deeper,0.081108525
idea to that it's the idea of the artist merging with their subject or their,0.056367498
art on a less literal level and how that's going to build through the film,0.11281246
and it's since through these moments she's discovering herself and she's growing as an artist,0.20243679
until she finally in the end of the film she draws herself she draws a,0.0772845
portrait of herself but she's not doing it for a business she's not doing it,0.15381803
for herself um she's doing it for someone else she's doing it for Eloise that's,0.094946
the moment when we realized that she's made her full evolution her full arc as,0.087925486
a character and her individuality has shifted as a result artists and muses is the,0.08092566
story here but as I mentioned before there's always a mirroring of that in terms,0.07814811
of the filmmaking process and you can also look at this on a more subtextual,0.05468711
sense you know there is muse and filmmaker because I know that in real life,0.06659499
and I didn't know this until you know after seeing the movie that the the,0.06729629
director did date to the actress who played Eloise for many years they were together,0.09037707
and I know that they are pretty sure they broke up prior to making the,0.09904744
film but even so there is a there is you know something there and even,0.067898415
before knowing this information just the way that Eloise is framed in the film you,0.09852266
can tell that the filmmaker is enamored with her she's capturing that elusive muse in,0.109008774
a very hypnotic way and therefore we are hypnotized as well and I really think,0.06927619
that Adele had now I think that's how you pronounce her name um I think,0.15034375
she's wonderful in the film she gives by far the best performance for me she,0.09724011
has a hardness to her but there is a sensuality and a playfulness as well,0.1770554
in her eyes and just very very striking there are images in the film that,0.098796725
are just so stunning especially when you have that beautiful French backdrop there are a,0.116095215
lot of images that stuck out I love the ones with three ladies and you,0.14960839
know you see their silhouettes as they're walking and that in the backdrop is that,0.08315754
gorgeous fiery sunset the image of Eloise in the darkness and she's there's a long,0.15492494
shot of her as her dress catches on fire that is another one that is,0.48898792
very forgot very dynamic sciama is very minimalistic but there is kind of a impressionistic,0.31089434
approach almost though it looks like a painting there are many intimate moments in the,0.060112663
film off and my favorite parts are the parts where characters are alone and nothing,0.11637167
is being said or just specific moments between the two women where they're very simple,0.25942922
there are no pretenses it's just a love story it's the moments person you can,0.073617995
tell some it isn't really trying to evoke something those are the moments that really,0.049489938
stick out to me as the most strong and the most the most human however,0.15380158
that kind of segues into a lot of things that I don't like about the,0.15175126
film even though there are some gorgeous images in the film and it's beautifully composed,0.053134643
and and on all of that I think that you know even if you have,0.078997344
an amazing artistic is how it clearly does I think you have it's important as,0.07097289
a viewer or at least as a critic I should say it's important not to,0.10027243
be just so intoxicated by the way something is designed and structured especially when something,0.062814735
is so aesthetically driven you have to be careful of that for me I like,0.24138197
to be also very home care of the filmmakers point of view and what they're,0.056182068
trying to say and and not being so intoxicated by the rest and when I,0.13113225
look at it from that point of view it doesn't affect me as much and,0.05462682
I find myself realizing that there are moments that stick out to me and that,0.09632878
I remember and that I'm pleased by when I think back on it but as,0.054397177
a whole the film doesn't mean that much for me I found myself wishing that,0.040955257
the story itself had more of that complexity so that it matched the richness of,0.03620088
those images that the beauty of those images that Salma is is working so hard,0.103568815
to create I don't mean to say that the film does not have passion behind,0.090764716
it because I think it does I do think it comes from a vulnerable place,0.08760199
coming from a place of having a break up and moving on and that's mirrored,0.08835593
through the story for sure but I you know so I don't think that the,0.051577847
intent is disingenuous it's it's more I don't think that sciama quite has the confidence,0.108905
and the awareness yet as an artist to be able to to work on that,0.065134816
next level because as it stands it does feel kind of already and very lofty,0.051852245
and I think that our house filmmaking when it's done really well it's exploring all,0.05682176
sorts of aspects of art and how it is tied to the human condition in,0.104494154
a truly vulnerable way well a lot of the images are very symbolic I think,0.06305952
that they're too conscious of their symbolism in a way that just kind of it,0.14303087
puts me off a little bit and I just don't think that the that Choma,0.11631909
is quite trusting in the spontaneity of the moment and the integrity of the core,0.07798893
story yes I know that it's meant to be kind of artistically heightened and distorted,0.09549467
but there's something about it that does feel staged in a way that is you,0.08892103
know that I don't think Sam is quite conscious of and it doesn't give the,0.08501451
film true fluidity so I always felt a little bit removed from it I couldn't,0.14527556
help but think about persona directed by Ingmar Bergman while watching this film just because,0.087575294
there are so many similarities between the two films you know you have two women,0.24333172
in that film also in a house very secluded from everybody else and they're very,0.053622834
few cast members in the rest of the film it also relies on silence and,0.075250775
emptiness and beautiful images and similar ways yet persona to me excels in all the,0.26599348
areas where this one does not it's about morality in a way that really cuts,0.05891359
deeper and it's much more multi-layered and it doesn't seem to be so concerned with,0.07028868
political statements it's simply just that aspect of it is just simply a part of,0.06872462
the tapestry and part of exploring the psyche so emma has been very vocal as,0.071402885
an artist about how she does want to employ politics into the film which is,0.08041778
fine I mean there's typically going to be a political point of view whether you're,0.065850645
conscious of it or not because of the society that we live in you know,0.15711926
when you're making when you're writing a story as an artist but I think if,0.08949107
you're gonna do it really consciously it's a tricky thing for it to not come,0.2425855
off as a contrivance because when that happens that it loses its authenticity there are,0.1007229
times when that aspect of things is very pointed and and not in some crazy,0.31089434
overt way where they're just rubbing it in your face constantly but enough for me,0.55926365
to feel that it cheapens the overall effect of the film and the meaning of,0.04672269
it they talk about equality as a pleasing feeling but it doesn't feel that equal,0.1321193
to me it just seems like they're kind of dismissing males and as not allowing,0.37282714
women to do this or that and that feels trite and not particularly well written,0.56341916
to the story it loses its sincerity to the thinness of those conceits and while,0.1577145
I don't want to use the word propaganda because that's way too strong of a,0.062712625
word I think it does exist especially when you look at there's another character in,0.07876724
the film a young maid it's like a subplot young girl where she's getting an,0.31089434
abortion and you know that's fine you know whatever I think it's fine to make,0.4030855
a movie about that but it just it doesn't feel like it works it feels,0.06823472
very disjointed like something that was inserted like a you know I got a feminist,0.5926458
agenda and it didn't really contribute to the overall story for me in a way,0.053943224
that felt cohesive maybe sciama I think sees the world in quite an extraordinary way,0.12878107
but I I want more confidence in there to where she can trust in just,0.046855554
what she feels in her soul and bringing that out so we can fill all,0.24143563
those empty spaces and that those silences to truly ripen to levels where it doesn't,0.11565924
have to rely on on socio politics in a way that feels kind of uninspired,0.09728988
at times and I really don't like to talk about politics trust me it's not,0.11813362
something that I I uses the focal point of my reviews often but when you,0.086021006
have a director who is very vocal about that and who does see her film,0.11533818
as political and as a feminist work then you know I kind of have to,0.19261439
break that apart much to my chagrin and I like to think of it in,0.10494237
the sense of like what if you had a male director who only had males,0.2596446
working on his set and it was an all-male cast for the most part and,0.12699735
they only talked about women in passing in that way I definitely don't think that,0.29429147
would go over well in the liberal arts scene you need to always think about,0.08033165
that and is this feminism that you are using as part of your thesis is,0.24116787
it really a tool for equality or is it more there to defy convention and,0.09737485
I think in this case it seems to be more that second one not on,0.073538534
like a completely rudimentary level but just there enough where it to kind of annoy,0.3170128
me and I think she's better than that so yes a little muddled still not,0.281625
quite sure what I think about it to be quite honest with you I all,0.101176076
I know is that there were moments that connected with me but just overall I,0.058981143
didn't feel it in the way that a lot of people have and a lot,0.06510745
of people have spoken to me so highly about this film the artistry of the,0.10432129
film just feels a little bit on the nose for me and not in the,0.09492046
ways I think that sama really intended for it to be at least for me,0.073124625
and you know when I look at her and when I look at this movie,0.11137392
it looks like something that a very very talented and precocious art student may just,0.09356944
after they got out of art college or whatever and so yes if it's very,0.07615716
impressive and there's like you know I'm interested to see what they do next for,0.08470196
sure but at the same time it's it is a little arty it is a,0.07143542
little embellished and it's lacking that sophistication in that maturity so a lot of the,0.17127183
the thematic elements especially the political ones and all of that they aren't into woven,0.15537448
very well but she does have a gift for sure and I want to make,0.118181676
that point I don't want people again I don't want people thinking that I I,0.17321657
hate this film or anything like that because I do think that the pieces are,0.4032832
there I just want them to come together narrative ly aesthetically all the way and,0.31089434
I am interested to see what she does next because I think that she could,0.1486443
just slowly get there and if she can get there I think she does have,0.061605226
a masterpiece Center I don't know I don't know if I want to recommend this,0.096489124
or not I think it's an interesting discussion to have and I think that if,0.06314455
you're really into films that are aesthetically driven you're going to love this film so,0.24919648
in that sense I think I would recommend it but yeah that is my review,0.085099675
