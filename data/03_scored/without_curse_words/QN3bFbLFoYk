a lady on fire this is a 2019 film it is rated R it runs,0.14940682
two hours and its stars probably not gonna saying these names right no Emmy Merle,0.093164206
aunt Adele hen L Luana Boz Rami will give those a shot there you go,0.25796372
the description of this is on an isolated island in Brittany at the end of,0.08987098
the 18th century a female painter is obliged to paint a wedding portrait of a,0.12497738
young woman this is portrait of a lady on fire well I am doing a,0.45047766
review of this movie but that doesn't exactly mean that I liked this movie or,0.081652954
any movies like this I am usually against watching movies with subtitles I usually don't,0.102103144
have the patience for it I you know I can't just sit and watch two,0.063075915
hours of reading a movie it's not what I watch movies for it's for entertainments,0.1047728
for to be interested in something you know it's to be invested in an idea,0.07022692
or watch a cartoon or watch an action scene or something I don't watch movies,0.19335766
to read subtitles it's just not what I do so when I sat down and,0.082612835
I started reading this movie last week or last night I'm sorry when I started,0.059440196
into it and I was reading the subtitles I was like you know what I've,0.07048431
been meaning to watch this movie for a while because it's been on my list,0.08423051
I know people have you know been suggesting it I know what it's about it,0.053860284
sounds interesting now maybe there won't be so much talking because it's about a lady,0.15120065
painting and I thought maybe it'll be fine so that's my overall opinion about this,0.08253861
movie after watching it is that yes it has sometimes the whole time but there,0.03534307
is a lot going on with the painting with interactions that you can kind of,0.16207203
tell what's going on even if you weren't to watch the subtitles whatsoever but honestly,0.11806736
you know for future use of this video in this times of the virus I,0.1830944
just kind of felt like toughing my way out through this movie because it has,0.07008477
been on my list and I wanted to watch the whole thing - people say,0.17481716
I've seen it and that's another reason why I decided to tough it out last,0.083083935
night - so as you get going in this I don't know maybe other people,0.15120004
are like me where they don't really like the subtitle movies as you go through,0.09683843
this it gets more interesting and you kind of know what's coming it's pretty predictable,0.15098451
and it's of an olden time and it's of a story one person's story in,0.0673381
history and it's a nice love story I guess and it has some other things,0.065830775
happen that are of intrigue and it has pretty dry characters you know I mean,0.1016689
they're talking what French or I think there's a little bit of Italian than in,0.15463409
this also but it's it's fine it's a fine movie if this were made in,0.059387483
English like I would have preferred it probably would be a little bit of you,0.1876921
know maybe a high school movie where people are you know they only have the,0.10907912
summer to really enjoy themselves and they just are meaning to talk to each other,0.03948474
but they are getting around to it in the last couple months that they have,0.060516603
available so I mean it's a very generic movie in that sense that the reason,0.087022305
why it was made was because of one person's experience in history they had this,0.07010781
person that they liked while they were doing a job and then that's it you,0.104037166
know that's that's the end of movie so it's it I don't know why we,0.078514054
keep making movies like this and why people think this is interesting but you know,0.15396954
I guess it's a kind of a life lesson you know for people to stop,0.21839389
waiting until the last second to tell somebody that they like them it's at the,0.06174675
reason why we keep getting movie after movie after movie of this idea where you,0.08466123
know I don't know you know I Netflix and theatres alike get the same movie,0.088298686
just in different forms so portrait of a lady on fire it has four main,0.23299348
characters and maybe a cast of thirty people you know not too bad not too,0.110441774
big of a main necessary people that are around it's a little slow because it's,0.2623285
only these three to four ladies in this house at a time there's some nice,0.07586686
walks on the beach where in the ocean where it's very pretty scenery the painting,0.074294634
by this lady that is the main character of the movie which is doing the,0.12499522
painting she has some nice artwork she gives some nice lesson she knows what she's,0.19307227
doing she shows her expertise you know there's good interaction between her and the housemaid,0.13894495
that's nice you know to paint out kind of you know some human characteristics they,0.12486925
weren't just completely stuck-up they addressed the issue of being a woman versus a man,0.18552151
you know there's there's some nice elements to it as far as that goes it's,0.07806746
not why I watch the movie but it kind of came out so can I,0.08012257
suggest it sure you know go ahead and go watch it a lot of people,0.08595405
watch these subtitle movies a lot of people are interested in this kind of a,0.18320993
movie with the painting and the scenery and all this stuff and sure you know,0.05260324
it's it's worth the watch if you're up for that and you have two hours,0.108758986
to waste and you want to get involved and you know this movie was out,0.3066006
in theaters somewhere I think I might have seen it at one of the smaller,0.06040368
theaters while the while they were still open and everything but I just didn't have,0.06475097
the urge to go see it in theatres for sure and I'm just kind of,0.06305164
happy I saw I'm not really excited that I saw it or anything like that,0.09305069
but I'm just glad I saw it so it's out of the way I'm gonna,0.10138419
get portrait of a lady on fire on see rating and I just can't get,0.38214245
that excited about it for you you're gonna have to see yourself and kind of,0.27860364
see what I mean that is kind of a bland movie it's kind of a,0.26160696
bland story and reading some titles is no but no fun for anybody so if,0.08578473
there is a subtitle movie out there that I have to watch let me know,0.102110244
maybe I can tough my way through it if I can find it I'll give,0.05924727
it a try but this is probably one of the better ones that I have,0.06535642
seen since I sat through the whole thing I enjoyed it you know I'd say,0.079304546
it was fine so I think I could give a lot of subtitled movies a,0.09822765
really low grade because I just don't care and I can't get invested in them,0.22214669
and a lot of them I just stopped it after half an hour if I,0.10845044
think it's completely boring after a half an hour so I see for portrait of,0.15896364
