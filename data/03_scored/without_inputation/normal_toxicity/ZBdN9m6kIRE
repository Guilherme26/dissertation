hi I'm angel and this is my review of the movie get outs written and,0.07080145
directed by Jordan Peele most notably known for Key & Peele the skit comedy show,0.08883477
on Comedy Central and the basic premise is that Rose wants to invite Chris to,0.019557834
meet her family in the woods and he is just concerned that they might not,0.09451761
know that they aren't of the same color she tells them don't worry he goes,0.24083117
along with it and horror movie comedy ensues I have to say that this is,0.12464608
my favorite movie of 2017 I have seen tons of reviews of the movie I,0.046594873
watched it twice already with friends with family I just wanted to add another review,0.053077985
out there but I don't know if I can say anything that hasn't already been,0.059890747
said about this movie it is brilliant first of all Jordan Peele are you kidding,0.073932976
me is this the first time you're writing and directing a movie a plus incredible,0.109415606
not only is it filmed properly the pacing is right there is symbolism everywhere I,0.06339251
actually had to read an article after watching the movie about little symbols and hints,0.10172962
that you may have missed within the movie and there's so much going on you,0.09902753
don't catch everything there's a lot I did catch but a lot I didn't and,0.055579323
that was what was surprising it's really thought out and it is a funny movie,0.06839302
it is the kind of scary movie that you watch with friends with tons of,0.15383877
people and all audiences I do not think this is a movie for any audience,0.11627119
in particular there is a dynamic there especially specifically black Americans and white Americans that,0.21937072
is addressed under layers of comedy and horror thriller there are some scenes that aren't,0.07605727
even part of a war movie they're just like real-life like the garden party scene,0.23147275
at the Armitage his house where Chris is scrutinized and asked the most uncomfortable questions,0.088150464
that's a reality for a lot of people in America and it's sad that some,0.106763266
people don't know that and that's what I really appreciated is that this movie started,0.1050354
a lot of necessary discussions around the world when I watch this movie with friends,0.09101872
some people didn't really like the way Daniel kahl√∫a played Chris they thought he was,0.05419242
a bit too muted in his acting and I kind of agreed but at the,0.15388183
same time I don't because we're so used to seeing big acting in war movies,0.15103708
and if you really look back especially the second time I watch this movie around,0.15200764
there are subtleties in Daniels acting that really harm masterfully done just wow you see,0.150325
a multitude of emotions crosses face in moments there's so much doubt and he's in,0.10568919
a situation that makes a lot of people when you are the minority in a,0.07485363
situation like this you feel uncomfortable you feel paranoid you feel crazy it kind of,0.53490317
reminded me of my experience at a resort in Cuba and the people around you,0.07488764
make you feel like no you're seeing things that aren't there which is kind of,0.10846423
what Daniel goes through with Rose I think your family's kind of racist the way,0.5624544
they interact with me and Rose is just like I think you're reading way too,0.08498171
much into it Alison as Rose did also a fantastic job really well done and,0.055539127
it's hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it but I'm trying I'm gonna,0.18776096
try not to say anything spoilery until I really get to the spoilers I didn't,0.053685676
see the story going the way it did it really did take me by surprise,0.07081227
it's very well written Betty Gabriel as Georgina gave me chills okay there are moments,0.09108411
in her acting subtle but powerful and after you've seen the movie once I urge,0.10209639
people to see it again because you will see layers upon layers of acting there,0.10990854
and you'll just be like oh my goodness girl Wow I'm talking James McAvoy split-level,0.12422505
acting here anyone acting for me Marcus Henderson as Walter - the gardener did a,0.10656928
good job he really did my brain is going all over the place with this,0.27643266
movie there are scenes in the film that seem random and that seem like typical,0.053872574
horror movie moments for example there's a scene where Walters just like sprinting at night,0.15253994
and there's that scene in the trailer where Chris talks to Georgina and the meltdown,0.15060985
and the episode that happens up on Georgina's face is everything and you understand at,0.24049851
the end everything comes together so cleverly but I started coming actually and when we,0.06101199
get to the end when we get to the reveal when we figure out what's,0.058391694
going on personally everything kind of started to click in my head oh I think,0.2957608
I know where this is going ok but still even when you think you know,0.10069479
what's going it doesn't go where you think it'll go it keeps surprising you at,0.08962923
every turn and that's what I really appreciated the end is just phenomenal phenomenal ending,0.09584795
for a movie not just a horror movie just any movie in general the twists,0.124259636
the turns the little events beautiful loved it lil rel Howery plays the best friend,0.108395204
rod Williams and he is such a necessary character he is the goofy funny best,0.6364068
friend the TSA agent he is perfect in this movie he really balances out he's,0.12804303
like the sweet to the sour chicken and the casting was just my excelente Bradley,0.19233406
Whitford I just wanted to say as Dean Armitage as a father he's an actor,0.113353476
that I didn't think could be scary and Stern but he brought it in this,0.06721234
movie he makes you comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time Missy the mother played,0.105933905
by Catherine Keener also in the same realm she's like sweet french toast you know,0.098665655
a woman that you would just picture as just the sweetest but she has moments,0.16883735
of seriousness in this movie that gave me chills I have to say the sunken,0.14959045
place is a brilliant invention and it describes so many moments in life so perfectly,0.07582983
being trapped within yourself not being able to speak up when there are things that,0.15140358
you want to say feeling powerless that's exactly what the sunken place is it's when,0.1062552
you are put in a situation where you feel powerless and it's such an accurate,0.27127862
metaphor for how Chris feels in this environment look Keith Stanfield plays Andre and he,0.04337107
is one of my favorite actors do Momo he's a character in Atlanta and I,0.08290264
really love this actor and he was also brilliantly cast the moment with the flash,0.071026996
and his panic oh there was so much fear in his eyes so much presence,0.2788346
the Keith man that is one actor to follow and I'm rooting for him all,0.050305884
day okay now I'm gonna get into a real spoilery moment so you've been warned,0.5154597
the ending spoiled apparently there was an alternative ending to this movie where instead of,0.14536385
our man lil rel showing up the cops would show up and it was actually,0.15359367
going to end a lot darker than it did and I'm very glad that they,0.19142324
rewrote the ending and made it light and heroic and we got justice in that,0.058047038
moment because ah life is already sad enough we don't need that we need heroes,0.12751296
in most horror movies the protagonist gets away he survives and he walks into the,0.2407137
sunset usually with a woman on his arm so I'm really glad that they treated,0.31807992
this as such and gave us a breath of fresh air um TSA yeah handle,0.081053756
that I also thought that moment with Chris and Rose where he was choking the,0.09055645
life out of her was interesting she was smiling some people didn't know how to,0.14886363
interpret that I felt like she was smiling at the fact that she felt she,0.06871751
was winning in this moment like she was being proven right that's the stereotypical angry,0.16651541
animalistic murderous black man is in all black men and she pulled it out of,0.8547164
him I think that's what he felt it kind of brought him back to Oh,0.09758195
I am sinking to your level right now and I'm not gonna do that and,0.2700869
I don't know race had nothing to do with it if anyone gets treated the,0.24173094
way Chris hasn't had been treated oh that girl had to go I mean it,0.18107617
would have been justified I'm not on the side of murderer I just want to,0.2981526
make that clear I'm just saying it would have been justified and it was funny,0.083938785
watching this movie has a mixed person the black side of me was like no,0.32353497
man get out get out um I'm sensing danger things are weird especially with Caleb,0.11082032
the younger brother after that scene in the dinner mm-hmm but the white side of,0.08234589
me was like oh we should stay and investigate I mean you never know maybe,0.1281861
he could uncover something maybe Rose is right maybe we should give her the benefit,0.053940054
of the doubt you know maybe he needs to go into the crawl spaces into,0.17901868
her room into that cabinet see what's going on um don't go there don't open,0.12604052
that cabinet leave so yeah being mixed in a horror movie there aren't many of,0.15094215
us but we usually die medium you know not at the beginning but we don't,0.35376722
make it to the end I could go on forever and gush about this movie,0.101375304
