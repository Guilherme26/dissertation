a Q&A with Bo Burnham I almost got the chance to ask him a question,0.0138604315
but they cut it off but regardless I had a really fun time now as,0.035436995
for the movie it's uh it's pretty good I don't want to say it's this,0.060878273
year's Lady Bird because they're two completely different movies but if I had to compare,0.039793283
