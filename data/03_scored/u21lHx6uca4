Austin which is where I'm still at right now it doesn't end until this weekend,0.08666478
and so first and foremost that when I was pets Jordan I went outside in,0.061876994
the hot Sun I was sweating in places I didn't know that I could sweat,0.23975506
in just to see this movie and I'm happy to say that it was actually,0.09341663
worth it and hopefully I lost a couple of pounds in the process of being,0.09496174
a high at sweating outside um so first and foremost is film centers around this,0.051085092
family who's basically going on a vacation they're chilling at their little summer vacation home,0.0696976
I say who had a summer vacation cause I sure as hell did it but,0.24261205
they're on their way to vacation everything seems to be going well everyone's having a,0.06182304
great time I'm having a great time watching them have a great time until they,0.07621624
are confronted by the evil doppelganger versions of themselves and then you know what it's,0.20974328
just hits the fan after that and then I was taking on the Sterling and,0.18657613
suspenseful ride that I was just like whoo I was screaming I was jumping always,0.1279176
be screaming and jumping people's looking to be crazy in the movie I was like,0.49379134
yeah this is actually scary I don't understand what you're watching but I know what,0.11608235
I'm watching right now but I have to say I really did enjoy this film,0.14192787
one of the main things that I loved about this film was how they were,0.074500084
able to balance the use of suspense and there's even a little bit of blood,0.31089434
and gore in this film as well kind of with the comedy there's actually a,0.09444367
lot of comedy in this film I'm mainly given by Winston Dukes character but I,0.101340905
was just like wow this is kind of like a dark comedy and I'm actually,0.10826604
loving the vibe because I feel as though the comedy hit in the best parts,0.2415553
it didn't take away from you still being scared and didn't take away from the,0.09517679
suspense that the film was giving I just thought that everything was so well balanced,0.06466293
and I have to say can we go ahead and put Dukan a romantic comedy,0.17528549
because after watching him at us I was just like he can definitely pull this,0.06341269
off and I am so here for it and thank you listen dupe for letting,0.3072541
people know that thick thighs matter because they do yeah also too Lupita yeah Lupita,0.40334597
did the damn thing I was just like girl so you gonna sort of parent,0.79734445
give us this little oscar-worthy performance like this plan these two characters which I have,0.12644899
to give kudos to the entire cast for doing so because they're not only just,0.0998259
playing kind of this the regular versions of themselves they also do a very great,0.08992596
job of showing the distinct difference between who their evil doppelganger is versus to the,0.30615047
characters that we were introduced to in the beginning of the film I thought it,0.03410447
was very well done and kudos to everyone but Lupita Lupita is the one who,0.055373408
took it all the way home she knocked it out of the park I was,0.24007875
like yes girl yes I was here for everything that she was possibly in so,0.15201868
also - I do appreciate that this is a different tone a film than what,0.08237895
we were used to and get out and I really do feel as though I,0.10012498
have to make sure I've set the correct expectations for those who are watching the,0.026947774
film because I think it will help enhance your viewing experience this is not a,0.08085787
political movie as get out was this is not a racial movie as get out,0.25184834
was there are certain type of political things but not what you were thinking in,0.063574545
regards to race and get out was kind of more in-your-face as to what was,0.20080517
happening throughout the course of the film and I have to say that I appreciate,0.06252272
Jordan going into a different route now for those of you who might be for,0.09763735
those of you who might be more caught up or and get out I do,0.24274647
feel as though some people may feel as though get out was the better film,0.06332558
however because I love that he brings in more aspects of the horror the blood,0.2397811
the gore and then even to this underlying story of you know where are these,0.0793572
people coming from who are they you know trying to figure out what that plan,0.07658951
is I love how the movie makes you leave the theater continuously thinking okay and,0.10818651
if you thought that you had all these theories forget out you're definitely gonna have,0.13558342
a ton of theories as far as what US brings to the table and what,0.061396528
I will say is this is definitely a movie that you're not gonna get everything,0.26181427
the first time um I think I talked to someone from the studio who actually,0.07704542
saw the movie over six times they were just like there's something new that I,0.08120191
gathered from the film each time that I watch it so this is definitely going,0.061740644
to be a multiple repeat viewing I don't know if there's necessarily anything that I,0.061410364
didn't like more from a nitpicky standpoint will be more so I wanted to know,0.10145062
more about a certain subtype that was happening in the film and I didn't feel,0.062142346
as though all those questions were answered but I don't know if they were necessarily,0.064738445
supposed to be answer I think it was really supposed to make people leaving the,0.07956088
theater thinking like I wonder if this is what happened and so for that I,0.05839386
will have to say overall for us you gotta pay to see the film and,0.070913374
theater it's okay it gave me horn it gave me suspense it gave me last,0.2440326
it gave us great performances that would definitely keep you thinking from the time that,0.056584388
you sit you're a little behind in that movie till you walk out and probably,0.37198603
for the rest of the year because I guarantee there's gonna be some great series,0.02850889
popping up from this movie so those are pretty much my thoughts on us it's,0.14880522
