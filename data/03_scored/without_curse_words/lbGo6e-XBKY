today based on a recommendation of a former student alfred Bowden I watched portrait of,0.043962717
a lady on fire from 2019 Cecile how do you say her name Celine Scorsese,0.24475515
that's the level of filmmaking we have going on here Celine Shyama I'm sure I,0.120308146
brutalized the pronunciation of that anyway this movie is on an isolated island in a,0.10023244
Brittany at the end of that's like off the coast of France or and like,0.0844138
yeah at the end of the 18th century so when it's the 18th century what,0.061379988
are we in now we're in the 21st century so the 18th cent so I,0.036871117
was like the late 1700s I always get confused by that because I'm dumb anyway,0.6157008
a female painter is obliged to paint a wedding portrait of a young woman that,0.13528188
young woman's sister has recently died and the mother is also once the painter essentially,0.14230621
to keep an eye on her we need to name these characters because it's all,0.09005365
women and I'll just end up saying she she sent up saying she she she,0.40807196
so are the painter that comes is oh my god no me mmm Mariano yeah,0.12546694
yeah yeah and and that's that's Maryanne and then Adele hey Nell yeah yeah yeah,0.11708208
these are all French people is Eloise Eloise who is the woman to be a,0.23309304
painted yeah those are the two characters that we really need to know about except,0.055636365
there's another there's a hot woman who works in the house named Sophie and that's,0.35580873
played by Liana dorami me dude I don't know how to read any of these,0.24109595
names it's my fault I know anyway I'll learn them eventually okay so this is,0.21283403
a lesbian movie that's when I said that I was gonna watch it my roommates,0.6351129
girlfriend was like oh that's a real lesbian movie and I was like yeah okay,0.7070165
yeah no she wasn't saying like in a negative way but I was like yeah,0.16524817
I kind of get that feeling anyway it's about a cat so many things look,0.083149254
at all these notes I took took like serial killer level notes here so what,0.31089434
makes it fascinating is that the young woman kalenna or no Heloise sorry Eloise whatever,0.16900897
she she doesn't to sit for the painting because basically the completion of the painting,0.14986299
means it's that that she must be Wed to this guy in Milan she doesn't,0.19009998
want to do it she's never even met him she never been to Milan she's,0.2594485
never done anything really she's just been in the in like a nunnery or coven,0.25106764
coven covenant she was in a coven of witches yeah so she she only knows,0.40445364
like like she knows nothing basically she and she's very resilient against this idea of,0.15114352
marriage and being married off and not having her freedom and you know at least,0.1630592
there are books and like church music at the coven so you know she and,0.08016234
then and then our painter Marianne she's like free you know she doesn't she her,0.1501187
father was a painter and she'll take over his business and she's could paint her,0.15111928
portrait artist you know and so she does have freedoms and slowly marianne falls in,0.09058534
love with Eloise and maybe she returns to love I won't spoil it everything I,0.15175332
say will be like I won't say anything after like the first hour of it,0.065825135
you know so there won't be too many spoilers so since since Eloise refuses to,0.08933682
sit for the painting Marianne has basically been brought in under false pretenses to be,0.15391721
like oh she's gonna just watch after you and take you on walks and stuff,0.18663901
she's gonna be like you're a chaperone and your guardian and just like a friend,0.4311345
until the wedding when in actuality it's obviously like you know so you know that,0.12173161
like I don't know what I thought was so good I can't even read my,0.1497389
handwriting I just feel like I should just straight-up read it like instead of trying,0.10766183
to read it quickly so it's basically perfect writing because they don't need to say,0.08911712
anything and within like a two minutes of the movie I knew kind of almost,0.1467855
everything that was gonna happen but in a and I know I've said that before,0.07750488
as a negative but this and like it's like in the best way like because,0.12661137
a lot of movies they tell you what they're gonna the movies gonna be about,0.07112122
and then while it's being about that they're telling you look if look what I'm,0.051539663
being about and then at the end it goes look what I was just about,0.05734311
look what you just saw and tells you all about what you just saw like,0.17078017
everything is handed to you whereas these the best type of movies you go oh,0.07604816
oh yeah all right here we go there's here we go this is obviously going,0.1260144
to be a love story and it's obviously a tragic love story because not nobody's,0.056921158
happy and just the music and the way people are acting and the the color,0.09127143
of the sky you can just tell the filmmakers all I can go and then,0.060672197
we know the time period and know that you know society's inversion to various forms,0.1328009
of sexuality other than biblical makes people upset so you just kind of know that,0.404494
and then and then any relationship that's starts on a lie or a deception is,0.16814561
gonna eventually come to the head so we know all that stuff and it's like,0.26215807
oh my god I can kind of like even predict the feeling I'm gonna have,0.08625303
when this movie ends but different than like a Transformers movie where you're like okay,0.24189183
this and this and the cubes gotta go here and then obviously that's gonna happen,0.10747119
and this person said I don't like eating hot dogs and at the end they're,0.3305647
gonna have to like eat a hot dog so the bomb doesn't go off because,0.2768487
it'll be a hot dog between him and the bottom line right push it with,0.35963073
his nose you know so it's not that it basically starts and goes this is,0.2081907
what the movie is gonna be about just by like setting up the vibe and,0.054444246
then it doesn't say look it's about that it just is it just unfolds which,0.053081542
is which is what the big difference is and since our protagonists like needs to,0.037082866
remember her subjects face for later the audience becomes fixated on all the little details,0.1499265
it's like a genius writing device you know and make sense within the story and,0.082983844
within the way it's shot and it's movie where you kind of like I just,0.37536585
said he kind of know where everything is gonna go before it happens but magically,0.06207541
it like works anyway and you know that it's a tragic love story forbidden that,0.075612515
there's like suicide in the backdrop and like there's always a storm kind of coming,0.46143532
that kind of feeling and some films suffer from this in a bad way and,0.17264779
they forecast everything that's gonna happen and I just think that this is the much,0.09744728
better way I mean it just kind of was redundant and how I said that,0.105812356
but yeah once it like you just let it unfold and you just burgeoning friendship,0.15044144
it's like gets you interested in its it is two hours and it is slowly,0.1401183
paced but it should be there's a you know it should I didn't feel like,0.06761366
that I mean maybe Kylie out in a few minutes but probably not I don't,0.05919664
know it seemed all there to me seemed like it was the right length I,0.08131357
don't know like basically so I wrote this note down and then like a second,0.11311627
later they stay like confirmed what I said like they set it up so that,0.08322395
they don't have to say anything and you just get it it's like music like,0.12906767
it's just like if someone might not be able to describe but within the first,0.12256367
like five seconds of an Elliot Smith song even a little kid can go oh,0.11480373
it's like a sad song right like it you can just tell it's not and,0.25470427
within you know three notes of a Chuck Berry song you know oh it's gonna,0.101054415
be like a rock and roll like jumping around kind of song you know and,0.2051644
and sometimes it's hard to describe that especially the intricacies of music and so the,0.07660232
second I said that they the character asks oh you know it says something about,0.043775287
music and I was like oh my god my ears pricked up I was like,0.3125914
that she's like well you know you get to I'm gonna go to church listen,0.15092486
to music and although you never heard an orchestra before have you and she's like,0.15214789
no and and then she goes what's what's orchestra music sound like and she goes,0.09990612
it's not easy to relate music and it's like wow and then later that's a,0.046032883
thing like where it's like impossible to relate like your love for somebody in words,0.116738215
and then in the film then goes on to showing like through actions how it's,0.05444595
pretty amazing it's pretty amazing it's not really three acts it's like a midpoint that's,0.063097246
what I feel like or maybe it's five acts you know it's either like I,0.08650663
don't know because at the midpoint it like reak the movie kind of restarts not,0.15003778
not literally but we get like kind of a fresh I don't know I don't,0.06363731
want to spoil anything but that makes it sound like there's some Shama Lani and,0.08970461
twist like at out one our 100 the alien comes down and transport them all,0.2290356
to Planet lady on fire now it's it's great it's amazing and it says it's,0.24587123
like this feminist beacon type movie without pounding it you know like into the ground,0.5576453
or even have it like saying it you know but at one point you realize,0.06616616
oh look this this image right here is showing like a functioning family of all,0.15105088
women you know like two women and then like a younger woman like that's kind,0.48807883
of representative of a child like they're doing everything fine like there's complete harmony here,0.13248527
there's baby there's basically no men in the whole movie and the ones that are,0.29525638
in there are like I'm here to eat okay boy you know great so it's,0.15856962
all it's almost like how women are treated in almost every other movie it's just,0.37918106
like we need you to be there you know I don't know so it's great,0.14857762
I would see it I was expecting it to be more graphic you know because,0.074117936
my most recent French lesbians extravaganza movie was probably you said French I think blue,0.36020824
is the warmest color and that is like 30 minutes of that is like hardcore,0.10330586
pornography I think I think that movie is actually beautiful and not that way guys,0.7039624
but it is when I movie ended I was like kind of kind of like,0.050707586
know what it must be like to be a teenage lesbians like going through like,0.6369925
making the decision or coming coming to light anyway yeah everybody in this movie the,0.084363066
cast is amazing the writing is amazing directions amazing it's just top-notch in every way,0.076591425
and I really like that that like the biggest like element of it that I,0.06357238
like is that how you end up having to study the characters in the way,0.066801906
a painter would have to and how all the characters are like fully represented and,0.050864186
they're not just there to serve the story like they have a life outside of,0.082905516
the movie and within the I don't know whatever just watch it's on Hulu you,0.1794717
bastards it's not as long it's not like brutal yet like I we've talked about,0.8606264
this a lot but like once the pacing I understand this once a movie gets,0.07466967
over a certain like or if it's just not paced - it's something you're used,0.09794591
to then you start going this is boring and that's that makes sense that's by,0.12694539
design because you're used to all right I don't want to talk about this anymore,0.15930292
all right let's see what happens if I push this button we get in sound,0.09289363
I'm I'm like I'm afraid of doing something in anyway [Applause] okay I probably should,0.066388845
put a camera somewhere where you can see what I'm doing I don't even know,0.24528696
what I'm doing yet that's new set up is it's not fully there yet okay,0.11348519
