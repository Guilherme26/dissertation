[Music] you got friend in me you've got a friend in me so just got back from checking out toy stoie full I told story toy story toy toys Stoli Stoli both toys story for I must say that you guys don't know this but I've never seen any of the Toy Story movies and what I decided to do was educate myself and I watched all three before going to see this movie a Tron I'm going to play it the game but I watched the third one yesterday actually no I watched the second and third one yesterday before going to see it and I watched the first one on Tuesday yes printed them all and watched them and any good time you know that wasn't really super sad like a lot of Disney movies with people getting killed and everything so it was a nice change you know you see that the toys you know they care about being the joy of children you know they see them as almost the cake caretakers that their joy they like to be there to see them grow up and everything so I got to see all three of them back to back to back and I enjoyed all three of them so going into this one they could have left off at the third one if they wanted to and after seeing this movie they could actually continue with another trilogy if they wanted to I love Star Wars type of thing but they don't have to okay you know that but first off I got to say the voice-acting superb as usual and I think key and peele is actually in this I think can peel is in this they're not so it's one of them the one that plays the substitute teacher I swear it's his voice as one of the characters in here the two of the funniest characters at their period and but like I said voice acting great all right the animation which is what I go for when I'm going to a Pixar you know movie yeah you girly going with the three things going for animation voice acting in comedy that's what you usually go on forward Pixar least that's what I go for and it was super I mean they mounted there was there are screen shots of this movie where you looked at it and you know the characters aren't any you're gonna think it's literally something real do you not think it's real okay you think there's a shot of a neighborhood street or shot of some woods who were shot of a road you know a shot of houses you're like oh how is this a you know you're gonna think it's real like that's how well he did think there was shots shot so it was raining and water and I couldn't believe like the beginning of you'll see in the beginning of the movie it's like there's a scene where it's raining and it's like what Jesus looks real like real um as far as the story goes I make you seeing it basically Bonnie makes a new toy named for key for he starts out not where I really wanted to be there and it's away momentarily and Woody goes after them and then the process actually runs into Bo Peep and a few other toys which kind fans into this hole I guess he did a kind of so I plug could saw its full plot but and it goes in a direction I anything it was gonna go and it really does and I enjoyed myself I enjoyed myself I wouldn't exactly call myself a Toy Story fan but I'm a person who enjoys the Toy Story movies okay after seeing them all in today's I think that a lot of you who may have grown up with it will be more attached to what happens especially at the end they can end the kid bigger truly ended here if they want to and they gave one of the main characters like the Captain America ending so okay happily ever after so nice so I will give this it was on this a good time for me but I don't have to see it again I don't I don't know they don't have to see it again I actually think I like the second and third one more than I like this one but they're all good movies I'm give this a 3 out of 5 woos which basically for you guys it's a c4 Stockman and a good time no alcohol required for Jeremy who's a mean post comments down below let me know what you all thinking if you enjoyed my movie review hit the like button subscribe and share make sure you get over to my Instagram but do that post funny and cool stuff that long don't post yeah that Ron like to play it again Bob 10 million subscribers woo you may now subscribe
