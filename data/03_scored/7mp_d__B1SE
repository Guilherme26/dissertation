had a fun time I leave a Pixar movie my mostly not necessarily probably not,0.08417924
with the monsters University at was a little bit different I think maybe but most,0.21441248
Pixar movies i leave the Pixar movie and I really have a lot to think,0.08287765
about that I think that's definitely one of those movies there's a scene in this,0.06401551
movie that is just really really stuck with me I mean I wrote in a,0.08038143
min a day but it really struck me and I can't wait to watch the,0.14068142
movie again when it comes on blu-ray so yeah I'm definitely all for this movie,0.07897448
I liked that I had a lot of thing for efforts but any nice get,0.07266727
on to what the movies about so basically we have a little girl called Riley,0.18870245
she's 11 in this movie I knew she was mom and dad she's only child,0.31089434
and basically they move from I think Minnesota to San Francisco I think it's Minnesota,0.08972241
than before I didn't move to San Francisco and obviously you know she's got to,0.06304067
leave friends behind and she's got to go to a new school and she's got,0.33220047
to leave her hockey team behind which he loves and all this stuff and she's,0.15213093
kind of it's basically I've got the outside situation and then most of the story,0.043901477
goes on with inside her head I'm sure you probably all know this I mean,0.4711377
who doesn't know what inside-out us about yet but anyway we have the emotions inside,0.13350436
the head which we have joy sadness disgust anger and fear is there any more,0.24210638
joy sadness disgust anger and fear I think it's fat if ya know I said,0.45513803
yeah and my favorite emotion was definitely sadness and I was really happy about how,0.066236265
much she was actually in this movie at first I already had two felt like,0.08541619
she was my favorite before was in the movie I was all excited for the,0.075145654
movie I decided her like I played the little app on my phone which is,0.09420459
actually really cool he hadn't played inside our app I'd recommend it's fun and yeah,0.14037143
played the app and I've like sadness and I loved her in this movie chef,0.07771938
that didn't disappoint me i think my second favorite character was probably joy she's kind,0.15498328
of our main character because basically you know inside this headquarters where all these emotions,0.10882224
are droids kind of in charge she's kind of wanting to keep Riley happy obviously,0.21275474
you know and the others kind just bit in every now and then I'm see,0.14900428
a joy I really liked as well now we also have a few moments but,0.056703344
not very many I think maybe I would have personally likes her to be a,0.45624143
few more of these moments cuz i found i'm really funny but I think maybe,0.105245255
kids wouldn't as much but basically it's a few times when we get to inside,0.15362412
the mom and dad's head and I thought that was hilarious i love that i,0.31089434
loved the mom dad's heads I went inside there's I thought that was really funny,0.31089434
those scenes definitely made me laugh the first half of the movie I definitely got,0.12457846
a lot of laughs and I found it funny and it was relatable and it,0.11349228
was cute and it was just it was funny discussed definitely made me laugh a,0.067698605
lot at one point and I was just laughing I haven't really laughed too much,0.0652537
like that in a movie before oh well not before but you know recently and,0.086633764
it was so funny I'm so cute and then the second half of the movie,0.080534376
definitely what I don't want to say sad it was kind of sad but not,0.079274975
in a bad way not sad about it was just kind of that kind of,0.06452519
heart hurting Lee sad but happy kind of thing I'm and it was surprising the,0.091874875
way that it ended was definitely interesting I like the message obviously I can't give,0.054051667
I don't wanna give too much wags if you have this in maybe I definitely,0.41905358
think you should just go and see it and be surprising loved it but if,0.09983779
you have seen you probably know all the things i'm talking about it if you,0.08256819
need to explain it but um yeah there was things that happened i didn't expect,0.053299204
you i could say we have kind of our main characters of joy and sadness,0.13575971
they're kind of the main main 2 i'd say and and the relationship between the,0.06805602
two of them was really really interesting I really loved it and I especially loved,0.07475554
sad this his story that progress throughout the whole film I thought it's fantastic I,0.05288977
loved it I loved the concept of it and the idea and the kind of,0.059833627
message behind the whole story and then we also have another character called Bing bong,0.07421688
and at first I was like being I'm not really gonna tell you who being,0.14996286
wrong is you probably see a picture of him I thought what what is Bing,0.14881139
bong Sao looked him off like what is this and yeah he's actually really really,0.14024399
awesome and he's at first I kind of Italy was a warm to Bing bong,0.34897888

he's probably he's a tie joy and Bing bong and my second favorite character I,0.18409057
just loved them and I don't know there's so much thought kind of ending part,0.11872267
