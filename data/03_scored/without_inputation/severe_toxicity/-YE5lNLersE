hey everybody today I am going to be reviewing rear window this film came out,0.15236697
in 1954 and it was directed by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950s where Hitchcock really,0.022032212
hit his stride where he had the most creative control and he really didn't work,0.23425037
his way through the ranks people tend to forget that but he had been working,0.019175915
a long long time you know he had one or sorry Rebecca the film Rebecca,0.02426989
had won best picture at the Academy Awards I think 14 years prior and little,0.021065036
by little he built his signature style and then it kind of came to fruition,0.06504698
became most prominent in the 50s at this point he was making movies like strangers,0.028365426
on a train which I love and films like dial M for murder which is,0.13392143
quite similar to this film in the sense that it is about a murder and,0.12598379
it all for the most part takes place in one area like a play and,0.033128805
it also stars Grace Kelly I don't think it's as mature thematically as rear-window would,0.05901443
absolutely worth your time and then along comes through window which is of course one,0.043663986
of his more memorable works any time that somebody I know somebody who maybe has,0.022513805
never seen a Hitchcock film I usually tend to recommend this one for them to,0.04060148
start out with just because I feel as though it really encapsulates everything that hitch,0.07017288
is about in terms of what he wants to say and many of us don't,0.013413428
have that thematic thread that carry throughout a lot of his films but I feel,0.073146254
like this one is is kind of going a little bit deeper and in yet,0.06330153
it's still very entertaining it's still very mainstream rear-window is in many ways just a,0.048792552
commentary on the act of viewing a film a commentary on the audience as warriors,0.026803575
and I think that the movie brings those ideas out in in ways that are,0.051062822
very sophisticated just in in terms of the storytelling and of course building that slow,0.05779781
tension in a way that only Hitchcock really could at that time the idea itself,0.07879566
is an ingenious premise having your protagonist be immobile the James Stewart character has broken,0.033808623
his leg and he's he's stuck in his apartment in the middle of the summer,0.06484011
to pass the time he watches his neighbors in his apartment complex with his little,0.041477527
binoculars he sees all of their different stories makes judgments about them and all of,0.025086736
that and then he begins to suspect that one of his neighbors might be involved,0.03714452
in a murder but he doesn't have the concrete evidence to back this up it's,0.26953033
just great it's the perfect mystery thriller set up the film opens with one those,0.017854195
classic Hitchcock shots where he sets up all you need to know in one single,0.3099647
shot he's really really good at this we see the entire apartment complex we get,0.35103294
a very good indication of who each neighbor is just in this one shot which,0.04443161
is also mirrored in the last shot of the film as well where it comes,0.020753065
full circle and then we move into the apartment where we see James Stewart and,0.01532051
we see that he has a broken leg that he's confined to a wheelchair and,0.12907156
this is all in one shot everything is set up exactly everything you need to,0.07834666
know and again this is all in one shot you know we see everything that,0.29042527
we need to see there's nothing superfluous there's nothing to break it up and we,0.057994038
don't need any other information other than that it's pretty perfect one thing that I,0.04545067
really love is that the majority of everything that you hear in the film is,0.01151832
diegetic it's all within the world of the film most of the music and all,0.5739977
of the sounds and all of that so the characters are always conscious of it,0.01916128
and you don't see that very often in movies you usually hear like a musical,0.028437931
score I'm very used to hearing this big sweeping Bernard Herrmann's score when I you,0.070599265
know see a Hitchcock film of course that was kind of before that point but,0.041179523
still but here you don't get that you know hear you all the sounds that,0.022229107
you hear for the most part are from radios they're from cars you hear the,0.017882798
piano being played by the the composer the pianist on the bottom floor you hear,0.036236543
car honks and sirens and the way each sound is employed right at the perfect,0.04774622
moment to build the suspense is quite ingenious they put a lot of effort into,0.021540642
the sound design and that's quite evident because the sounds are really aligning with what,0.00923541
happened on-screen and not in a way where it's like hammering you over the head,0.1934926
it's not overwrought in any way it just kind of paints the perfect backdrop for,0.1291055
the subject it just all adds to the the immediacy it really immerses you in,0.03845493
that world and you know as I said I love the Hitchcock scores they are,0.07138485
iconic a lot of them but this one does not need a score and in,0.0435376
the same way that the birds really didn't need to score either it's a way,0.011704572
to play with the tension a way to play with the expectations of the audience,0.024328427
when you have like a diegetic music and stuff like that in place of a,0.5763739
score there's a lot less of the manipulation going on of course there always is,0.024410909
going to be manipulating manipulation when you're watching a movie but this one is a,0.057658117
little bit different scores purposely help to guide the viewer and they help you to,0.018766161
evoke certain emotions our times and here you just don't really have that luxury so,0.027882503
a woman can be getting strangled you know in the window across from the James,0.35004103
Stewart character and you'll likely hear something like smooth jazz or something that is very,0.012963764
out of place and it's it's disturbing but very realistic and of course that makes,0.025687397
it feel a little bit wrong a little bit more disturbing and constantly throughout the,0.0760704
movie all the different characters around the protagonist are off they're always asking him why,0.015423614
are you doing this and you know are you sure you should be peeking into,0.029542137
these people's lives the way you are at what point does it go too far,0.043683276
James Stewart is the perfect protagonist to play the the Geoffrey's character because he is,0.011627411
and I mean he was at the time one of those guys that everybody loved,0.052371904
he he stood for the everyman so it's it's perfect casting he represents the audience,0.029562756
in the same way that like Kyle McLaughlin represented the audience in Bluebell but as,0.010350257
lawyers it's the person who gets to sit back and watch everything take place no,0.039418116
matter how disturbing and they are in complete control whereas everything outside is not and,0.019749302
as lawyers we can vicariously live through the characters on the screen in movies right,0.041869983
you know we project our own feelings and our own stories on to them and,0.0169542
to me that's a very powerful thing about movies and just about art in general,0.019535778
I think that sort of thing has the power to change people's lives in the,0.083801165
way that they view the world and even in this movie seeing all the different,0.06604409
neighbors through their windows it's like each window is its own little movie screen or,0.020455062
they even look like panels in a comic book and I think that's really cool,0.11709095
because you know really movies are sort of windows into a different world aren't they,0.026409786
and so that really illustrates that idea I think that the perfect example of the,0.01943201
voyeurism here though would be with the Miss Lonelyhearts character she's a woman who lives,0.088208005
on the bottom floor she's middle-aged and she's a very lonely person and we start,0.10312209
to see progressively throughout the movie that she is suicidal she's aging and she doesn't,0.17532645
have anybody special in her life Jeffries feels sympathetic of course but maybe at the,0.10092965
same time he might see what he might become because you know in the movie,0.02853904
there's that dynamic between him and the Lisa character played by Grace Kelly the idea,0.02044309
of will he marry her won't he and I think Lisa also when she sees,0.075131826
Miss Lonelyhearts she also kind of feels the same way it's that fear of of,0.042754013
being sad and alone but they get to peek into this person's life without her,0.087749034
knowing and they get to project their own story their own feelings about their own,0.01390899
relationship on to her but then there's that tinge of sourness that comes with that,0.032150988
as well you know because it's it's at that point that Lisa begins to question,0.015551994
whether or not she should be watching this sort of stuff because there is that,0.024516009
kind of sadistic quality of getting to see people go through such anguish but it,0.47895163
still gives you that control getting to see somebody else and live their life and,0.053013142
all of that and while you can feel for them you don't have to directly,0.029347237
be involved in their lives so it gives you that that great control and we,0.045884367
want that feeling without experience that experiencing it directly and you know classic horror tropes,0.062413517
of people being butcher humiliated tortured all of that it's for us as viewers it's,0.5458663
cathartic it arouses our emotions in such a way but again it's it's in a,0.08779293
controlled environment we know we're gonna be okay at the end of the day we're,0.03021131
not gonna get butchered ourselves and I think that's perfectly normal to a certain extent,0.17676191
but at what point does all of that start to become gratuitous and when does,0.02511401
it become unnecessary it starts to reveal a certain level of cynicism and darkness within,0.13841407
us that we may need to examine another thing that I really kind of think,0.031136582
is cool about this movie and I didn't really think about until watching it this,0.03131751
last time is just the way that the characters as they're watching the neighbors how,0.01101012
they make assumptions about them and it's the same with us you know the way,0.021664366
we judge people as boyars Jeffries sees all of these people around him but he,0.04370922
doesn't know their whole stories all he can do is really infer based on what,0.016503206
he sees beyond that his knowledge is unreliable as is ours as audience members we,0.04037532
only see what we're shown and we don't really know these characters and that's part,0.014844238
of why the murder is so interesting because we really don't know whether or not,0.12992832
he's truly seeing what he thinks he's seen and there are moments in the dialogue,0.0298122
where we see all that reflected naturally you know like where the Thelma Ritter character,0.03183436
says that we should look inward sometimes for a change and and their Grace Kelly,0.015926491
a character saying that you know it's really kind of disease that you've got all,0.12103017
of these opinions about these people that you don't even know and you know it's,0.058071863
a good thing that she's not alive in the millennial generation all of these factor,0.17269231
into what we perceive as viewers ourselves and how that can that can be kind,0.04480943
of dangerous so of course hitch is very conscious of the way he's manipulating us,0.057823747
he always has been he's always kind of seen that is as funny to him,0.032635905
he's amused by the way he can pull the strings with audience members it gives,0.05297456
him complete control but I think here is kind of the first kind of tip,0.05398564
into a different direction where he's starting to really explore that idea more and we,0.020113157
see that go way further in films like like vertigo which came out a few,0.098405935
years later he started to make those connections about artists as commentary on society not,0.03090909
only does this movie implement those devices really exquisitely but it's also just I mean,0.04909787
it's just really entertaining on a basic level and you know I think that the,0.04544801
script like a lot of the films around this time that he's making the script,0.06717423
is just really witty the characters are are so likeable and relatable which is is,0.024058362
key everything is choreographed and so meticulously well built as I said and I love,0.034033455
that he's pushing himself a little bit more and I do think this is one,0.09288957
of his better films for sure and yeah if you've never seen a Hitchcock movie,0.03237582
this is a great place to start and that is my review thank you all,0.020609384
