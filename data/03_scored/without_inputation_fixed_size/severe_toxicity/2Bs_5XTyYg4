strong hearing and the only way to survive is to not make any noise. Horror,0.060711313
movies like this are rare. And I m not just talking about the plot or,0.023705814
the acting or the production value. All of these things take this movie to another,0.040943384
"level, but A Quiet Place manages to do something that not many other genre films",0.035200853
are capable of: it transcends its premise. And I know that might not sound too,0.02546722
"impressive, but it really is, especially for a horror movie. The basic premise of A",0.04964332
"Quiet Place is about as simple as you can get; if you make a sound,",0.017321382
"you die. And not only is it simple, but as a logline pitch, it sounds",0.47635052
gimmicky. A horror movie without sound or at least without much dialogue. And if that,0.04942514
"s all this movie was, it probably would ve been a gimmicky novelty film. But",0.033399537
luckily it s more than that and it s really an oversimplification to just reduce,0.03198336
"it to that premise. Now that being said, we can t disregard the premise cause",0.022543075
"it s fantastic. Again, it s something that could ve been gimmicky in less skilled",0.06420286
"hands, but it just works so well here. And I have to say that I",0.02646034
think going to see A Quiet Place was my favorite horror theatrical experience. It s,0.0711048
a tough one cause this could ve been such a disappointing experience with the wrong,0.05573241
"crowd. Luckily, I live in Maine, so most of the movies I go to are",0.030056989
"almost empty. And so when I saw this film the Friday after it was released,",0.02144419
there were only four other people in the theater with me. And those four people,0.07461232
"were, amazingly, considerate movie-goers. They were absolutely silent and engaged through the whole movie. No",0.03188957
"whispering, no phone screens lighting up; they even put their popcorn aside once the movie",0.019965487
started so there wasn t any maddening bag rustling or chewing sounds. It was silent,0.12624188
and I couldn t have asked for a better first watch of this movie. The,0.04535488
sound design for this film is impeccable and it s still the example I always,0.027639711
point to when people ask about good sound design and editing. And that usually takes,0.03173857
people aback a bit because you might think that a movie with tons of sound,0.06476162
effects and music and plenty of dialogue would be more impressive in the sound department,0.027038384
"than one without these things. But, in the case of A Quiet Place, you d",0.035225466
be wrong. Cause here it s not the amount of sound that makes it so,0.0400986
impressive: it s how that sound gets utilized. It s also about how the silence,0.031888902
gets utilized. This is an incredibly tense film because of that effective sound design. The,0.03433944
quiet of A Quiet Place is where this movie shines. Things that would normally go,0.03783498
"unnoticed in most other movies are impossibly prominent in this film. The sound of breathing,",0.02904591
"bare feet walking down a sandy trail, birds and the wind, and a river in",0.04076977
the woods. Even just the natural ambiance of a silent room. They re all things,0.050255954
"that would be relegated to the sonic background of almost any other movie, but here",0.031550325
they re critical. They re all things that you re acutely aware of cause of,0.022235759
"the consequences of sound in this world, but they re accentuated cause of the sound",0.0379015
"editing. The smallest of sounds have you sitting on the edge of your seat, holding",0.05187235
your breath. So when they re contrasted by the few sudden instances of very loud,0.038296618
"noises, it s scary. And not just in a jump scare kinda way. It s",0.04337596
much more visceral than that cause of the potentially fatal implications of those sounds. And,0.030242575
"surprisingly, what s even more startling than those moments are the moments of complete silence",0.052703165
"when we re experiencing the world as Regan does. She s deaf, so even the",0.07772471
"natural background ambiance drops away. It s absolutely silent and in that silence, it becomes",0.07317552
deafening and even more terrifying than before cause you truly have no way of knowing,0.027733501
what s just off screen. Sound and the lack thereof are definitely incredibly important parts,0.046546225
"of this movie, but like I said before, this film is more than just its",0.028276958
premise or logline. You could consider it a creature feature and while the creatures are,0.025552364
"impressive, it s not really about them. It s much more a story about family",0.013794579
and about a family s ability to cope with dire circumstances. The creatures introduce a,0.04572406
"post-apocalyptic survival element to the story, but that s not all this family has to",0.037544962
"deal with. On top of that obvious external pressure, they also have to contend with",0.016168619
"internal strife and personal tragedy. So, it s just as much a story about grief",0.030070957
and regret and forgiveness as it is about survival. And that grounds this film in,0.05472865
a way that s very rare for horror. Alright let s talk about the pros,0.100157365
and cons. There s no question whatsoever what pro number one of this movie is,0.02733306
"for me: the sound design. Like I said before, if somebody were to ask me",0.024738844
"for an example of great sound design, this is the movie that comes to mind",0.018152196
"first. Not only is it wonderful in its own right, but it so perfectly and",0.036086213
effectively captures the tension and tone of the movie. It sounds obvious that a movie,0.031206425
"called A Quiet Place should be fairly quiet, but it s not gimmicky and works",0.02673373
incredibly well. The use of sound and sometimes the complete absence of sound is incredibly,0.044583935
fitting for the situations and really enhances the film in ways that sound rarely can,0.0103762
in a typical movie. Pro number two is the tension. A good chunk of this,0.041568656
"tension is thanks to the sound design I already mentioned in the first pro, but",0.011163112
sound can t do it on its own. The way the story builds also makes,0.025371434
for an incredibly tense ride. It s a pretty short film and there are a,0.04626685
"number of very intense moments, but it s almost structured like a slow burn without",0.039940953
actually being slow. We get hints of obvious foreshadowing which just heightens the edge-of-your-seat anxiety,0.0551557
"and has you cringing knowing what s likely to happen. At the same time, we",0.036772016
and the characters get bombarded with unfortunate curveballs which keep us constantly guessing what s,0.05257545
gonna happen next. The third pro is the premise. A horror movie where you have,0.04706241
to be silent or else you die. It sounds simple enough and to a certain,0.42667073
"extent, is simple enough. It gets to the heart of the most basic horror movie",0.043041375
"rule, but then expands upon it to tell an unsettlingly possible story of survival in",0.029188259
"a post-apocalyptic world. It s easy to be reductive about this plot, but for as",0.06812877
"simple as it seems, it covers a lot of thematic ground in a really effective",0.03527136
way. Plus it leaves you wanting to know what actually happened at the beginning of,0.020489652
this apocalypse something it looks like we might get a look at in A Quiet,0.046411194
"Place Part II. On the con side, my only real issue with this movie has",0.036990196
gotta be the frustrating lapses in judgement. Characters making stupid decisions is pretty much par,0.41298044
"for the course in horror movies, so it s not something I can be overly",0.049796313
"harsh about here. Especially since in their day-to-day activities, these characters are really smart and",0.024094947
"resourceful. The kids make some dumb choices at times, but again, not a huge deal.",0.1514683
The most frustrating part of it all for me has to be the big choices,0.044101674
"inherent to the plot that are just so dumb. Like, maybe a baby isn t",0.4652855
the best thing to have around in a world where silence is an essential part,0.06551926
of staying alive. Or maybe living near a waterfall rather than on a naturally silent,0.0694638
farm where every minute sound you make travels for miles? There are illogical things like,0.015636472
"that that you could tear this movie apart for, but it s really a very",0.029542802
minor issue in the grand scheme of things. Before I give you my rating and,0.037508376
"recommendations, I want to remind you that if you're interested in buying A Quiet Place",0.040379975

"Place 4 out of 5 paws. As simple as it might seem, this movie s",0.047942445
an incredibly original and tense horror film that effectively uses sound to elevate its story,0.032528147
to greater heights than your typical creature feature. I would recommend A Quiet Place to,0.15198848
anybody who s a fan of horror movies or thrillers. This movie s got some,0.08383908
"incredibly tense moments and an effective anxiety-inducing atmosphere. Plus, it s got some great creature",0.036233217
design and anybody who appreciates sound design or editing should love this one. If you,0.032180253

"film. In that one, vision is the thing that can kill you and even though",0.30948967
"this movie doesn t match the tension or quality of A Quiet Place, it s",0.047667727
"still a decent watch. If you liked the mystery of the apocalyptic event and creatures,",0.016908303
