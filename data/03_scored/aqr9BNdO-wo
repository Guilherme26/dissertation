is Richard Brody's New Yorker review of actress Olivia Wilde's directorial debut book smart now,0.15337652
I often disagree with Brody which is fine but this piece genuinely bothered me because,0.18938047
it fails to do what Glen Kenny told a group of aspiring film critics six,0.11911704
years ago of which I was one what should be the backbone of their writing,0.116915405
talk about what the thing is not what you think it should be it's bad,0.15256394
if anyone does the latter but it is almost painful to read the 71 year,0.054664847

who goes into book smart is going to see this version with anti-trump monologues and,0.4035652
Mean Girls archetypes so blathering on about them isn't helpful to the discourse and in,0.40131244
any case we should all be thankful because that movie would suck hello anyone everyone,0.72389346
and welcome to the week at review you can call me a guy who doesn't,0.12350476

been a teenage girl I often relate to their coming-of-age narratives more than I do,0.08431048
teenage boys the Afra mention films alongside some deeper but still fairly recent cuts like,0.057329662
detention and girl asleep do genuinely rank among my favorite films of their years but,0.2502755
also period I just really connect with them on a fundamental level although my reaction,0.08343283
to eighth grade during which I sided pretty heavily with the father because he was,0.09295819
doing his best suggests that that may be changing and the fact that I can,0.032194592
so quickly name a number of recent releases is a sign that this back half,0.086147524
of the 2010s has marked the beginning of a new era of r-rated teen comedies,0.08472319
now finally told from girls perspectives we're now 15 years removed from Mean Girls which,0.24956867
remains a seminal film but was not of course rated R and that film focused,0.051275626

and even the stuff that is can't define them except the theater kids they're exactly,0.09263572
who you think there has Czech theater kids represented I found it really interesting though,0.09974094
to see how people reacted to her again this isn't some world where people pour,0.14446454

her they generally react in kind treating her how she treats them hell even the,0.41364053

in the bathroom stall as three of her peers talk about her is undercut by,0.11430237

schools I didn't go to this schools if you've heard of my alma mater it,0.11516647
may well be because the recent New York magazine article about the sex cult that,0.46746275
was happening it's now being turned into a movie by Mark Wahlberg so yeah book-smart,0.26472867
is a movie that a decade ago would have been a slap in the face,0.41789788
that I've needed but not yet appreciated I was kind of like Molly but with,0.054628134
less ambition so just me but for all of the things folks get judged for,0.108457424
in this film and it is a lot there is significance in the one big,0.089274794
thing that no one is judged for here that still inspires way too much judgement,0.059546012
everywhere Amy is gay so are other people and it's fine blockers has this whole,0.7484861
subplot around Sam's concerns that her sexuality will result in estrangement from her friends and,0.35282928
family and while these fears turn out to be unfounded and it is an emotionally,0.2404299
impactful arc it's nice to see a story where a teen girl is out and,0.218377

powerful a friend of mine posted on Twitter about how moving it was to see,0.06666989
the queer gays in a mainstream film and though I can't really speak to that,0.6026814
even I could see its significance there are of course infinite darker timelines of the,0.085818484
same events and this is some kind of idealization and Amy's parents are Christians who,0.0729763
aren't super psyched about the whole thing but they love their daughter regardless and that,0.118739866
discomfort is played for comedy not drama and Holly freaking lujah for that it's not,0.40454015

for each other and it's a little disheartening how much Molly feels she needs to,0.0745579
control Amy's life particularly disheartening for me because oh shoot I've been that - Amy,0.3331194
is pretty content with the life that she has and has had Molly feels hers,0.1520905
has been wasted and that by extension Amy's has to but she's projecting that hard,0.24264894
Amy would have been happy staying home with her parents Pond errific congratulations feast but,0.06755105
Molly wasn't gonna let that happen this all comes to a head in a truly,0.31089434
beautiful moment that makes me really curious to see the film script because I want,0.043676086
to know if it was presented as written or if that was a bold as,0.10988569
hell directorial decision in either case I want to commend Olivia Wilde on what she,0.46018845
has done here actors trying their hand at directing can be something of a mixed,0.14288953
bag but I can't think of many recent examples as confident as wilds it's almost,0.045288805

lessons we can all learn something from well I will openly admit that I relate,0.071651384
to Molly a bit too much for my liking and so her lessons were more,0.102943994
explicitly mine damn near everyone has at least a little bit of that judgment inside,0.5627623
and can get something valuable from the way book-smart breaks those judgments down and even,0.21226256
