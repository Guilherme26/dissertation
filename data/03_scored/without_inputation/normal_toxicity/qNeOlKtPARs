screw Anatomy,0.44281033
I think I prefer that this is what actually goes on inside everyone's heads inside out,0.30298907
so inside out is the newest movie from Pixar Animation Studios,0.116815835
everyone loves them or at least we used to love them before cars,0.119668685
too,0.030334655
let's face it,0.18501487
Pixar has kind of fallen from grace ever since cars 2 and brave,0.07086171
I really liked monsters University,0.11957376
I thought it was right up there with all the other great Pixar films,0.11760041
so I thought all right,0.062069923
if Pixar can get another one right then they can remain immortal and we can forget all about cars 2 and brave,0.050663944
so this movie revolves around this 11 year old girl riley or rather,0.31089434
more specifically all the personified emotions inside her head,0.2870088
Riley's family is moving from Minnesota where she grew up to San Francisco to start a new life,0.059735194
so this is really the story of how she deals with it and how all these emotions deal with it,0.0670188
there's joy sadness disgust fear and anger,0.26307938
and I will say this about them all these characters were portrayed wonderfully I love these emotion characters if fix our excels at one thing it's making relatable characters I mean given that these characters are emotions,0.10274103
it's really a no-brainer that they're all relatable you have joy voiced by Amy Poehler who's always hilarious it's funny the guys at Pixar must be huge fans of Saturday Night Live in the office got Amy Poehler and fear is voiced by Bill Hader and sadness and discuss their voice by Phyllis Smith and mindy kaling respectively plus anger is voiced by the always hilarious lewis black all the voice acting,0.33312297
in this movie was perfect,0.11791439
these were excellent casting decisions I bought them all I empathize with them,0.16656512
I laugh with them,0.11078438
I gotta say though the funniest out of all of them was definitely fear just the way he moved and reacted to everything made me laugh out loud,0.1231649
so props to Bill Hader the movie has a really good story,0.059344873
but with the story comes the movies biggest flaw also you see as the story's going along and you're seeing more of this world that Pixar has created at a point,0.11500035
it feels like that becomes the point that pic stars trying to get across like it felt like Pixar what's going hey look what we can do,0.0906297
we can make all sorts of cool stuff that shouldn't really be the point of a movie the point of a movie should be to tell a good story,0.058323372
but the movie did have a really good story,0.058445193
so I'd say it feels like half and half at the time it felt like they were showing this big world just for the sake of doing it,0.088125095
and the other half of the time it felt like it was more focused on the story and don't get me wrong,0.065318614
I like seeing this big world that Pixar has brought to us they've never failed at that they've never disappointed us with our animation ever and it's also really cool to see how these emotions interact with Riley's consciousness,0.11036163
I wouldn't say they really control her thoughts,0.09924543
it's more like they help her out,0.1041138
I love how that was illustrated and it sure as hell take it over whatever science,0.24455464
our anatomy tells us this is what I believe now as good as a story of this movie is it is also a tat predictable which was very shocking to me because I don't remember Pixar movies being predictable at all,0.0821688
but when I think back to all the great Pixar movies we've gotten they do follow a pretty basic formula,0.114089705
there's always that one point,0.05003626
I think back to the first toy story where Woody and Buzz are on the street and they're trying to catch up to the moving van,0.07504801
and woody gets out the match to light the rocket and the car drives by and blows out the match,0.15033339
hope just doesn't seem lost hope is lost,0.17803293
there is just absolutely no hope for these characters that we have grown to love over the course of an hour and a half they've lost and then by some glimmer of hope they actually managed to pull through the situation and it's a happy ending,0.104365274
I'm just saying the pics are formulas getting kind of tired they're still pulling it off very well but I think next time they should try something new that being said I'll be damned,0.46846947
if the movie didn't give me the feels quite,0.07203186
a few times I swear there were a couple of scenes in this movie where I wanted to dear up,0.11226167
I didn't but I wanted to so inside out was very enjoyable,0.1479215
the characters were perfect,0.052803367
the story was good it kind of lacked focus from time to time,0.061848674
but i still like what I was watching,0.06473776
it's not Pixar's best movie but it is a lot better than cars to and brave,0.08544123
and it is a solid animated movie 4 2015,0.08486053
so I will say go see this movie while it's in and the scourge of this movie was great once again,0.23976867
it's Michael Giacchino,0.10138078
this guy is on a roll,0.33836466
