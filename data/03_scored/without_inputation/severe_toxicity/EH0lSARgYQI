brand new Spike Lee directed movie black clansmen a movie I've been looking forward to,0.07947614
for a long time if you guys don't know how my reviews work I like,0.06621371
to talk about the good the bad and then give you my score and I,0.041528746
have reviewed a bunch of movies over the last three days they're mag crazy rich,0.117900476
Asians and the package please go check those out but right now we're talking about,0.20619163
this movie let's get into it and keep this review shorter than usual so black,0.36366215
clansmen let's start with the cast because this cast is so dynamic and good and,0.07672095
Denzel Washington's son give such a great performance something I never knew could come from,0.041849364
well not the family in general because we know Denzel but his son just does,0.018453525
such a good job in his chemistry with Adam driver every time the guy pops,0.048106745
up in a movie I get excited to see it and he's one of the,0.04598947
reasons that this thing drew me in so much he was great their dynamics were,0.06819463
great the relationships that most of the characters had were really good and somebody else,0.011661335
who surprised me Topher Grace really good and the guy who was from I Tania,0.036218584
last year I can't remember his name but oh my goodness he comes out of,0.016817838
nowhere and his character was hilarious he gave a good performance now I definitely need,0.047951095
to hit on this a lot of people are going to see this movie as,0.21307363
heavy-handed whether you agree or disagree with a message there is definitely a message there,0.027732171
and it's definitely coming across on the screen but going into this movie seeing the,0.02467898
trailer you kind of know that that's coming you can see the social cues in,0.022552386
there and if you walk in end up getting really offended at it and not,0.044253338
like the movie for those reasons I think you're missing other points of the film,0.03561726
because yes some people will not like the message not necessarily the message because I,0.060269628
think if you're human you should like the message that we should all love each,0.04470899
other and be together I just think that's the truth but maybe spike directs that,0.057759892
message towards certain people who are watching this movie and I'm not necessarily a big,0.05626722
fan of that fact because I don't like when you're calling people out let's keep,0.097120136
the film in focus but I like what they did with the message and I,0.016357532
think the ending some people aren't going to be on board for it and while,0.08762264
I think it was a little bit too heavy and it it didn't go to,0.05798805
the point to where it offended me and I like the fact that that was,0.048662174
in there because I think we all need that as human beings right now let's,0.24421188
move away from that right now and talk about how good the movie was the,0.029366527
filmmaking here was brilliant I think it might be Spike Lee's maybe his best movie,0.03995359
in a long long time it's not necessarily my favorite because movies like Malcolm X,0.058364544
they're just so good but this movie is up there I will say it's 100%,0.051648848
his best in a few years the way that he interject humor into this story,0.031898215
yet keeping it serious I always talk about tone and how in a lot of,0.02632797
movies it's very inconsistent but here even though the tones tend to shift it does,0.026470983
it in a way that flows so good and it doesn't mess up the pacing,0.033392884
of the movie the pacing here is oh my gosh I love it there's one,0.11094731
point where the film slows down other than that I was engaged from beginning to,0.03175454
end I had to use the bathroom really bad and I always know how to,0.053864576
test a movie if I have to use the bathroom and I don't want to,0.025479194
leave I'm locked in and having a good time and I'm emotionally connected and I,0.07665843
didn't really want to leave even though I had to hurry what a pee to,0.097342975
myself I didn't really notice any technical aspects that I didn't like I thought the,0.0113846185
Senate ography was good I liked the shot selection the compositions the color everything about,0.29197913
it was just cool to look at now it starts off there were a few,0.04121877
here and there that kind of bothered me but overall I thought it looked good,0.08057503
it sounded good I liked a story I liked the plot I like to wear,0.029748343
it when I'm not going to spoil anything about that but there's some pretty high,0.040592168
tension when people start to figure certain things out and by the end of the,0.08508497
story you're really rooting for these characters in terms of negatives like I said it,0.019791875
did slow down in parts there's one scene towards the end all I will say,0.16593072
is initiation that scene lasted a little too long for me it cut back and,0.039303705
forth and back and forth between the blacks and the whites and I'm just like,0.23148024
ok they didn't cut the fat a little bit because I think this is going,0.25502944
on a bit too long I think the movie could have been like 140 135,0.037834316
as opposed to pushing two hours but you know what that's just a minor complaint,0.033017054
well there were some shots in there especially at the beginning of just like landscapes,0.09694254
a couple that were thrown in and I was like all right I'm not really,0.04418283
feeling these shots in particular let's get back to the story and what's kind of,0.07406753
serving the purpose here and yes I did say a bit heavy-handed towards the end,0.0779675
I'm not saying it was in your face because I don't like what movies do,0.1432586
that it usually takes it down a couple notches what I feel about the heavy-handedness,0.042245813
is not going to take this movie down and whether I agree or disagree that,0.024311133
doesn't matter I just don't like when you call people out that exist today in,0.11272335
real life some people are going to dig that and whether you're for him or,0.072260894
anti him that doesn't matter when it comes to reviewing this movie if it was,0.08314064
anyone unless you know like Hitler some even call him out as much as you,0.2755957
want but I just don't like what movies do with that whether it's democratic or,0.040827643
republican that always strikes me and rubs me the wrong way and as we get,0.25528866
into my score none of those negatives really took the movie that far down it,0.07723181
is definitely one of the better films I have seen this year and I was,0.012018538
so emotionally hooked and it's weird because these usually aren't the movies that I kind,0.096810825
of latch on to but this one in particular I thought was super well done,0.065404184
and I really enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would I'm going to,0.041055135
get black Klansmen and 87 percent this was a cool film it's got a good,0.17829981
groove a good job good pacing everything about it is just straight-up cool and I,0.093333244
think if you go and watch it you will get something out of it if,0.05750313
not really enjoyed thank you guys so much for watching this video you know my,0.075075954
