me black panther so Black Panther is the newest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,0.2702579
directed by Ryan Coogler when I look at his body of work and his age,0.2542579
he's younger than me I look at him and I'm like I've done so little,0.13680238
different Black Panther starts out shortly after Captain America's Civil War two challahs father was,0.13333899
killed in Civil War he is now gonna be crowned king but he's also the,0.37151894
Black Panther so in that there's that balance he has to balance being King and,0.18848146
dealing with the problems that come with that but also being the Black Panther and,0.09905246
problems that come with that I don't envy his position I really don't and when,0.1438419
this movie doesn't right it does it right when you look at Chadwick Boseman and,0.13789208
the performance he gives also Michael B Jordan the performance he gives both of them,0.06618409
have very emotional moments in this movie when you really think about it they're on,0.093128875
a green screen they're not out there actually it's a green screen what kind of,0.07885022
imagination do you have to have to pull that kind of performance when you're looking,0.054473463
at a sea of green when you look at what these movies are doing as,0.0992282
they're shifting into deeper character pieces quiet breath sometimes you can tell the green screen,0.083680265
which is a bummer a couple scenes where they're talking I'm like that that's a,0.20073071
green screen you couldn't find a mountain you couldn't just talk on a mountain I,0.091511056
don't know I don't make movies maybe they couldn't maybe it's just too cumbersome to,0.21666363
bring it crew up there but I liked the arc they gave King T'Challa because,0.06626355
when we saw him in Captain America Civil War he ultimately was a dude on,0.14945054
a revenge quest and I totally get to class me that hard all the time,0.26520193
I want to see the guy's heart how is he as a king is he,0.148914
just like yeah well they did a bad thing I guess we'll kill him too,0.8424637
no he's not like that at all it totally shows the guy's heart he is,0.100891076
a good King and as his father tells him it's hard to be a good,0.124041654
man and a good king and you totally feel that as Captain America was the,0.12905474
introduction to him this is the movie that gives that arc more relevant this is,0.08234911
one of those movies that strips away the armor we see the King behind the,0.07484861
black panther the man behind the armor I love stories like that unpopular opinion coming,0.4412661
at you I really enjoyed Iron Man 3 and I really loved the first Thor,0.092351526
because both of those movies strip away the hero and we deal with the person,0.19567287
behind the hero this movie does a lot of that too yeah he does suit,0.08565609
up in the black panther suit and when he does is pretty entertaining actually there's,0.03389999
one car chase sequence it's more than pretty entertaining it's pretty kick-ass well really when,0.7239348
I think about this movie I'm not gonna think about the Black Panther scenes first,0.24043192
and foremost I'm going to think about the character moments I'm gonna think about the,0.03301667
politics I'm gonna think about the culture I was so fascinated as to how into,0.09752082
wakandan culture I was it was so fantastic you feel like you have a front-row,0.25867775
seat to all of it you're interested and also how much of it stuck with,0.066914685
me I mean you really look at other worlds and movies and comic book movies,0.23444833
they don't do the same thing this movie as I can seem recent memory did,0.08502457
it best you see what a movie introduces the audience to a new civilization or,0.08449972
culture when the audience leaves that movie they can ask themselves what do I know,0.07047233
about that civilization or culture and usually the answer is very little it's not so,0.0869663
the case with Wakanda with Wakanda you walk out a black panther you feel like,0.40747935
you got a crash course in Wakanda and when you see it it comes across,0.24033485
as a very beautiful and celebratory thing I think that's fantastic and reviewing an MCU,0.113519005
movie you got to address the Marvel isms which are how does it tie into,0.10954575
the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole does the tie-in take point over the standalone,0.09591381
aspect of the movie and how is the humor not is the humor in it,0.08853729
but it's going to be in it so how is it for a large chunk,0.14065202
of this movie it works as a standalone film there are tie-ins in it the,0.0736299
fact that clause in it vibranium is a big part of it also Martin Freeman's,0.068166085
character but if you just went into Black Panther you would get the gist you,0.18970534
wouldn't need to watch another movie maybe Civil War it being the first movie with,0.07767604
Black Panther but really nothing else and I felt the humor really worked what I,0.24317497
look for with humor in a movie like this or a Marvel movie is it's,0.15218358
going to have humor so does the humor override the drama like if someone's having,0.11739132
a dramatic moment if there is a moment that's supposed to marinate and have drama,0.09966695
if you're supposed to take a pause is there a joke that compromises the whole,0.17731006
thing when that happens in movies it irritates me this movie doesn't do that the,0.07564127
supporting cast and characters that were fantastic - I love those warrior ladies I loved,0.07542716
his tech head sister Lupita Nyong'o was fantastic I loved him back ooh he's the,0.33786115
character man ape but they never call him man Abby's calling Tanaka I believe it,0.47960985
is pronounced mbaku I'm horrible with names names like Smith I'm like was it Smith,0.14905466
or Smyth but he was great I wanted to see more of him he was,0.09657292
so good and I had heard fantastic things about Michael B Jordan as the character,0.0828869
kill monger as the villain and he is great when he shows up when he's,0.7142795
on screen his motivation is clear you understand to a degree where he's coming from,0.11045666
but of course he's a villain so he's going about it the wrong way those,0.24172531
make for the best villains of my book but again I say when he shows,0.15023085
up because for the first half of this movie he doesn't I found that to,0.088978134
be a problem he does one thing near the beginning of the movie then after,0.09941497
that I forgot he was in it and he finally shows up and starts doing,0.077382125
his thing and it kind of gave this movie the feeling of being black panther,0.40336344
and black panther - crushed into one movie which I don't know if that was,0.28727582
the case I don't know if they were like that we have two ideas for,0.10201813
Black Panther we'll make him one I don't know if they were like we have,0.50995857
an idea for Black Panther but hey we got it incorporate Klaw into the movie,0.21720637
or if they were like we're going for the Godfather feeling where it's like three,0.061699137
movies in one well Godfather was three movies in Willing this feels like - I,0.07005332
don't know all I know is it makes Black Panther feel like it was split,0.3227445
down the middle into two movies and it feels like a season of 24 if,0.081391215
you remember the show 24 it had 24 episodes of season but it was really,0.04838553
two arcs twelve episodes each episode twelve rolled into episode thirteen and the new arc,0.074379586
just like this movie does but it does feel like two different seasons just like,0.043451883
Black Panther feels like two different movies but in the end Black Panther was fantastic,0.13636705
it has your fun superhero stuff in it yeah but that's not what the movie,0.11951113
is it's not what it's about it really is about a king coming into the,0.060079888
throne and dealing with being a new king and while they're telling that story they,0.06000615
bring you in on a very interesting fascinating colorful and vibrant civilization I feel like,0.052691665
most people who go into Black Panther will enjoy Black Panther it's all about how,0.2400108
much you enjoy black panther are you going to like it or love it I,0.28274548
don't know this up to you but it's worth paying money for it's worth watching,0.13662907
and worth buying on blu-ray that's right that is a purple blue right because when,0.05084409
this movie comes out on blu-ray if the blue part of the blu-ray package isn't,0.07178124
purple that's a missed opportunity marketing people a lot of purple and black in this,0.08108463
movie personal favorite color scheme of mine or it's a black panther it is here,0.27137753
it is upon us have you seen it what did you think about it whatever,0.07371299
you thought comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've,0.26422888
