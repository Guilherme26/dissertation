[Applause] the last Jedi was directed and written by Rian Johnson and it stars Daisy Ridley Adam driver John boyega Oscar Isaac Carrie Fisher Mark Hamill and many many others and since the force awakens we have seen the strengths of the resistance diminishing and the power of the first order increasing and as rey is looking to learn the ways of the Jedi from master Luke Skywalker the resistance finds itself in a race against time to run from the grasp of the first order and Supreme Leader Snoke the last Jedi is a film long anticipated for many and I will say this this film will make the two generations of fans or maybe three very happy Rian Johnson has written and directed a very ballsy risk-taking unconventional Star Wars film he directs the [ __ ] out of this you can see a lot of the influences he has named for this movie in the action sequences in the storyline in the character arcs and he takes a lot of swerves just when you think you know where this movie is going where certain characters are going to go he swerves you yet again hitting you with surprises that will leave you gutwrench but he does this not at the cost of story not at the cost of characters and how they were established not at the cost of their progress of their evolution of their growth he does this through having conflict and tension and dramatic way throughout the film from the very beginning from the very beginning the resistance is between a rock and a hard place as the first order and Snoke are hunting them down the last few remnants the remain of the resistance and this tension this dramatic weight this running against time is felt throughout every single storyline in this film as ray tries to learn from Luke they do not have a very easy relationship and the movie takes its chances with how we see and have the perception of the Jedi and the Lord and this character of Luke Skywalker and just when you think that you understand the character the movie yet again takes chances and changes your perception and this proves excellent writing from the part of Ryan Johnson as he explores and expands the lore and our understanding of it and of certain characters in this film in ways I never even imagined and a way he shoots this some the way he directs there are a lot of creative visuals in this film that I never thought possible a lot of his storytelling is very risky particularly without spoiling with Rey and kylo Ren and now they mirror each other and how they contrasts and how the force binds them together and now it drifts them apart let's talk about Luke Skywalker because we did not get enough of him in the last film this is Mark Hamill's best performances Luke and his best performance in his career this character is going through a lot the minimal exposition that was in the force awakens you got of Luke you understand that here through his character development this character has gone through a lot he is still going through a lot and most importantly and completely unexpected he is a completely flawed character and that elevated the film for me a lot the way he teaches Rey and what he has gone through as you find out in this film are very very emotionally heavy they are very emotionally investing and they keep you on the edge of your seat just like the tension that is felt throughout the film not only with the first-order rent in the resistance but also the friction between ray and Luke and Luke Skywalker does have some pants piecing moments in this film that are just nerd heaven I I nearly pissed my pants in the movie theater watching some of the stuff that Luke Skywalker goes through in this film and of course I will not spoil anything but a certain cameo in this movie was like looking into the face of God I'm saying nothing else Daisy really is impeccable as Rey once more a magnificently written character not a Mary Stuart so I refer the haters out there and to film me yet again takes its chances not only with her as a character but the way you find out more about rate again the visual storytelling comes into this the way Rey explores herself her connection to the force her past and other characters as pasts are very very risk-taking and bold and they pay off beautifully John boyega s Finn is funny SL once more and the film very well incorporates the funnies into the sim the comedy is very well incorporated it doesn't feel like it to Rails the story whatsoever it feels like something organic that comes out of the characters and Finn is yet again the greatest example of that and his chemistry with Rose is also spectacular Callie Murray Tran is also great in this film their chemistry is excellent and both these characters really connect with each other because they are both going through something very heavy emotionally speaking both Ameren is great once more coolest guy in the galaxy with another cool jacket to add to this collection and he was using a very surprising way for me I'm not going to spoil anything of course if you like what you saw with the grey areas of the resistance in rogue one you will like what you see from Poe here and let's talk about Carrie Fisher it was hard watching this film I'm not going to lie there's one scene in particular that we'll talk about in the spoilers review oh it was hard to breathe in that moment and Leia as a character is excellent as well she's still a badass she's still the general and that's one moment that I've always dreamed of seeing with Leia in this film that just brought the happiest of smiles to my face and we'll talk about it in the spoilers review but Carrie Fisher thank you it's also her best performance in any Star Wars film and I'm very happy with this Adam driver s kylo Ren continues to be yet again a conflicted complex and layered villain this film deepens our understanding of kylo Ren and it swerves us with this character a lot I really like the route that they took of this character it was not at all that I was expecting it was not at all what I envisioned for this character and in made me afraid sometimes I have to commend the Ryan Johnson's courage in this film because with characters with the storyline with the way he executes the storyline in this film it's ballsy this film made me afraid because I wasn't liking certain directions they were taking and the film swerves me and again to bring me something new I had never seen before but there's a storyline with Finn and Rose that I don't have problems with but I do have problems that it was so long there are incredibly important things happening in their storyline thematically speaking just like with any other storyline but it does take a little bit too long to get resolved and to keep going it feels like it stops like it slows down unlike the rest of the film and speaking of that the film in general is very slow-paced it takes its time with rays and kylo ren's training it explores the mental side of it how it affects them psychologically and how they progress through these struggles and it does so with a lot of other characters the action sequences are incredible both in space with the Falcon flying around and the lightsaber battles the lightsaber battles are probably the best in Star Wars history not gonna lie maybe not better than the final duel between Luke and Vader in return but my god the white shots the way we see our actors doing their stunts fighting around moving their sabers the fighting styles and all it's magnificent and the cinematography is also excellent I gotta congratulate the cinematography this is probably one of the most beautiful looking Star Wars film there is maybe the best one maybe top to maybe top three not sure but it is beautiful the last Jedi has a very clear thematic a thematic I cannot tell you about otherwise it will be spoilers once you see the film it'll all make sense and it is a film that imposes a lot of questions it changes questions that we had before into new ones it gives us a lot of answers and it makes us look forward into the future there's great exploration of the lore a great swirl in the storyline and our perception of the characters and the Star Wars universe it's a great addition to the franchise it keeps pushing our characters and their stories forward it has great dramatic way there are moments of pure raw emotion in this film moments where you will cry like that before moments where you will weep like never before in moments where you will just feel pure raw anger the last Jedi is by far the ballsiest Star Wars movie ever made and in my money it will go down as the most controversial Star Wars movie ever made the last Jedi is absolutely the stuff that dreams are made of what did you think of the last Jedi my beautiful
