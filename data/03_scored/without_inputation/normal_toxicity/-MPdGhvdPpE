I have said this about DiCaprio in the revenant I'll say it again for Sally Hawkins in here,0.07749336
the best work an actor can do is saying absolutely everything and anything without uttering a single word Sally Hawkins does that in here her character is absolutely lovable and whimsical and you cannot help,0.099621475
but fall in love with her,0.21701328
she reminds me a lot of Amelie as well as the film as a whole it is Amelie meets of monster film but the film doesn't necessarily follow,0.2511434
the tropes of a monster movie it has one single element from those films but it never falls onto those cliches,0.34105575

and I absolutely cannot do a review of the film without mentioning and praising the practical work on the inferior creature which is just out of this world from the way he interacts with Sally Hawkins from the way he interacts with the setting from the way,0.30053434
there are some lights in his body that will not spoil why,0.14934132
they are there Doug Jones underneath all this makeup and underneath all these prosthetics and underneath everything he just becomes this character,0.48525834
but also the character itself carries this weight throughout the film that makes you feel for it so much and also fits into the thematics,0.030600635
there are also there in the other characters and in the story itself there's some magical,0.020007081
and that's the right word magical work in here with this practical creature being brought to life,0.1797005
but beyond those mesmerizing visuals and the amazing performances also the well-developed characters in this film there's also a recurring theme throughout and that is the lack of a sense of belonging and the sense of feeling like an outcast all the characters in this film in their own way find themselves in this place in life where they don't feel like they belong,0.084097534
and or they don't feel like they have fulfilled everything they should in their lives,0.2102109

and they are learning with each other,0.031327948
and they don't have any prejudice or bigotry towards each other whatsoever and that's a bond that this film explores deeply well and in a very loving way even Michael Shannon as the villain as I said there's a lot of layers to him,0.15051995
because he doesn't feel necessarily,0.1511614
fulfilled,0.06594153
he's working under some,0.107168324

Michael Stuhlbarg without spoiling anything he also is an outcast in his own way,0.40322065
he's a scientist who wants to research the creature with very very pure intentions,0.33810356
and Richard Jenkins as I said amazing performance what his character goes through in the silmas beautiful arc really fits into what the backdrop is of this film there's a dark world being explored,0.09722694
but even in this dark world in these dark times there's a beautiful love story to be found,0.116980076
there are beautiful characters to be found relatable characters and a gorgeous direction and storytelling from del Toro with also an amazing help from the score well Toro has crafted something very special in here something that I feel many people will appreciate in their own different levels and their own different ways because there are a lot of themes in here that can be discusses day to day with just people that we know del Toro has created some of his best work with the shape of water probably his best,0.046825193
