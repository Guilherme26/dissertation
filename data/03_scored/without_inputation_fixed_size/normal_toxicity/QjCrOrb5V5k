hello everyone is your boy terrance here with hollywood already did it and i just,0.20293897
came back from the theaters from seeing a new coming-of-age comedy from first time director,0.08128804
Olivia Wilde and book-smart now the guys know this is one of my hidden gems,0.34849906
up for may 2019 so I'm excited to talk to you guys by let you,0.10132942
know what I thought about it so we'll get into it right after the jump,0.0769102
so for those of you who don't know book-smart is a film from Olivia Wilde,0.4778706
about two teenage girls played by Kaitlyn Dever best recognized from justified and beanie Feldstein,0.092419446
who in addition to being Jonah Hill younger sister she was also in Lady Bird,0.09206178
she's got a great career she's on tour on Broadway with Bette Miller now or,0.072652586
she wasn't 2017 so she's got a great career as well but it's about two,0.106840715
teenage girls who have been doing their entire high school life by the books their,0.29145452
straight-a students that get into the best colleges they've been doing everything on the straight,0.13248673
and narrow they had no fun no party they kind of just been living just,0.2580675
the two of them in their bubble while everybody else is out possibly succeeding but,0.09113559
having fun and they want to have at least one time or one night of,0.09086406
fun before they go off into college so that's what the prior premise of the,0.073849104
film is about and and I think they they succeed to make a pretty pretty,0.09987178
solid coming-of-age story that I think a lot of people should be seeing and it,0.09345997
should be doing better in theaters in it currently is so we don't know what,0.10903116
are doing the reviews here we talk about likes first then dislikes them they will,0.18493223
rent it okay so let's start off with my likes what I really like about,0.15146604
this movie I'm off top is that it it's sort of a smorgasbord of coming-of-age,0.22522716
stories I the biggest one that you can think of is because the two leads,0.11961197
and how it's kind of structured is super bad that's what comes to mind but,0.21754442
I would say super bad meets a little bit of Lady Bird with sprinkle in,0.40325996
some of last year's blockers I think all of those kind of come together and,0.06296005
create a good a new way of seeing a coming-of-age story from the eyes of,0.07626212
young women and I think what really helps the story and why it feels so,0.10819522
much more authentic is that it's starring women written by women and then directed by,0.31089434
a woman who you can do that and it creates a masterful add I think,0.28208208
masterful story that they've put together that even when sometimes which will get into dislikes,0.112154916
even sometimes when it gets becomes a little what you could see predictable you can,0.08352307
you can kind of pull out threads it's done in such a way and done,0.2401064
in such a refreshing way that because we're getting this story through someone else's eyes,0.07279674
it's just as new as it would be having seen American Pie all the decades,0.10262385
ago that I did to the direction of the film is really strong for a,0.04372161
living wild to be this her first time I think she did a really good,0.26650673
job I don't know films are shot out of order so I don't know if,0.14934601
she shot the first half of the film first and then the back half but,0.15543906
I feel like you can I feel like the eye of the director improved as,0.052628748
the film went along because it comes in a little less by the books and,0.069547884
it becomes a little bit more artsy toward the back half uh and I don't,0.15115729
know if that was a choice or if she she wanted to structure the film,0.07536208
like that but I think when we get to the final party in this movie,0.0805836
there's some great things done directing wise that I just fell in love with there's,0.068848595
an entire I'm not going into spoilers but there's an entire pool sequence that happens,0.069451496
that a reveal happens for our main character and you get to see visually underwater,0.06002965
all the reactions that Amy kaitland goes through to for the audience to kind of,0.046602435
a ride go up and down she's on cloud nine then a reveal happens and,0.086266585
she's not and you get to see all of that emotion you could just see,0.18521869
that come back and there's a great argument seeing sequence between Amy and Molly that,0.04138379
happens and you get to drop out the sound but you just make out the,0.112410076
face facial mouthing and reactions that they're giving each other and small simple choices but,0.25331262
it's so powerful and it works and it gives the moments that this movie could,0.05453097
just be like blockers which I liked to where it's straight comedy with some emotional,0.18672521
beads these emotional beats hit a little bit harder because there's a lot more weight,0.27333364
and gravitas to it I think it's handled really well three I really dug the,0.10416939
message of this film I know a lot of a lot of coming-of-age stories do,0.06959759
the thing where there's a smart person there's a dumb person there's a jock there's,0.80340844
the the promiscuous gorilla might have used the word but there's a promiscuous girl and,0.5973447
you can have all of it they're all separate people what this movie does well,0.13865498
and gives a message about and what I think is the actual tableau of what,0.067088135
high schools always had been is that people can be all of those things at,0.062030654
once and so there's a huge sequence that happens in earlier in the film where,0.066244
our character Molly goes through a situation where she realizes that what she thought was,0.0513295
necessary to get to school everyone took it to a good college everyone else's has,0.07209784
gotten to a good college as well while also still living their life and you,0.25895178
can still be the jock the sports guy you can maybe not even go to,0.1493871
school but get a great job a six-figure income job you could be what would,0.072236896
be considered the the high school and you still have a good solid school in,0.10208185
front in front of you and then I think what happens and what I really,0.15293601
love about the movie it that it tail ends and comes back to show you,0.19248392
that while you make while you may have your view of this one person and,0.21273395
you may have this one view of this one person as being the jock whatever,0.16134395
it is they are also the other side human and they've been struggling with the,0.10593604
labeling that people that put on them and maybe that's not necessarily the case and,0.08033528
maybe that's not and maybe it is the case but even if that is they,0.06286529
were just living their life they were being a kid they were doing what kids,0.20236725
do let them live their life they're still going to go off and do great,0.18222667
things as they grow up and I love that this movie kind of shows you,0.1382323
both sides and gives you the full coin of what it's like to be in,0.10207244
high school now let's talk about the dislikes this one's hard for me to do,0.19135398
this likes cuz that I feel like I'm pulling at straws to do this and,0.40181577
it shows you how I how much I do really really enjoy this movie so,0.15427999
my dislikes are me pulling whether sometimes no necessary there's no need to do so,0.24994934
one there is a secondary character in this movie that borders on the line of,0.102663964
being hyper-realistic or a caricature I love what she's doing everything she's doing is great,0.2970432
but it happened so much and so randomly that it it almost feels like we,0.051107742
are this characters like the roadrunner and just keeps popping up and showing up in,0.09280291
places where everything else seems super realistic and she seems to be the outlier of,0.08392113
that now it fixes itself a little bit this is where I I it's hard,0.15560529
for me to put this in a hundred percent dislike because it didn't really bother,0.108214326
me and the reason why it didn't bother me because there is a mentioning of,0.070794106
why of how she is or who she really is by a secondary care by,0.1396485
another character that's attached to her that kind of cleans up her her story and,0.091007635
gives her a purpose which helped me kind of click in my head like okay,0.33188674
I can then justify the wackiness and Jane it is so who that character is,0.10492684
to the the relationships that our main character Amy and Molly sort of wind up,0.068848446
to is very heavily Telegraph at the beginning of the film and for some that,0.047461584
could be a problem because you can kind of like oh well I knew this,0.16183683
was happening I saw this the read the writing was on the wall I'm always,0.068786144
for this one I'm undermining my dislikes but the reason why that didn't concern me,0.11185526
so much as yes it is very telegraphed and I could see if even the,0.058101837
moment to happen as though that's where we're going with these people the reason why,0.08925816
I've been bothered me so much is because it's unlike a lot of films that,0.1540493
do it then Telegraph it this feels earned when they get to that pay off,0.073416956
or when they get to those newfound relationships because they all have to have a,0.06873637
moment and what they are chasing that does not work or does not fail or,0.068642765
something happens that they have to Dinn kind of readjusting and flip on the fly,0.16451773
and say well yeah that's what I wanted but this might be what's better and,0.08093839
I think that's a fact of life that needs to be taught and so that,0.08495432
while it is Telegraph I feel like the process to get there is very realistic,0.060287658
and very true and very earned so it it doesn't matter that it's on the,0.05356788
wall like I think the directing in the way that is written and done is,0.028246727
so packaged together perfectly at weather you know that that's where they end up is,0.064561754
irrelevant I think it's the journey to get there is what's important and then the,0.05718806
third thing that that kind of is a disliking again not really um the third,0.16964483
dislike would be it's a predictable story but all coming-of-age stories are predictable I mean,0.09266701
that's sort of what they are you know that they're going to learn they're going,0.097142
to go start off one way they're gonna learn something important and they're going to,0.07820391
be a slightly different person than they were at the end of it that's what,0.09456903
coming-of-age stories are so none of that really bothers me yes there's a predictability to,0.07443361
it but again with one of my likes when I talked about the fact that,0.04514304
we're getting this from a woman from a woman starring women written by women to,0.36705932
showcase that women go through the same things that that guys do or sometimes leaving,0.301078
it's even harder for them I think that supersedes the predictability aspect of it makes,0.06885401
just a film that I think personally I think anybody should see this and I,0.11061826
it's funny as I was leaving the theater I was thinking like why didn't this,0.08814813
connect with anybody like why is this movie not working in the theaters and the,0.08984003
only thing that I can think of and it sucks because I feel like this,0.69542736
is a common thing for all all audiences I feel like general audiences don't want,0.048454482
to see girls because this happen with blockers too don't want to see girls or,0.26813057
women go through drugs foul language or sexual acts from adolescents to kid adolescents to,0.78478223
adults the way that they're okay with seeing it for guys I could be wrong,0.1330897
go ahead leave your comments in the comment section let me know if I may,0.112371
be off base but I feel like that sometimes is why movies like blockers or,0.07849105
or this when they do coming-of-age stories for women they're not as well received by,0.33953944
as they would be by the audience's of eyes they would be if I super,0.061065786
bad or like can hardly wait or American Pie it feels like the our American,0.22925225
culture is programmed to say boys will be boys but girls can't do that and,0.30800933
I feel like we need to get away from that as fast as we possibly,0.14211199
can and just show that like we're all we've all are willing and able to,0.040415064
f up and not know what the hell we're doing and we have to go,0.60250807
through these things this movie has a great sequence at the end with Molly and,0.07771781
a girl that she did not like that just made my heart melt because it's,0.35295632
like oh yeah of course a girl going to figuring out herself sexually doesn't mean,0.53490317
that that's whatever stamp or whatever name that they give her is who she is,0.16526727
as a whole she's more than that but I feel like our the way that,0.089179076
America works and the way the guys work is that they won't allow her that,0.15251794
process and in high school but there's a whole moment with her and I won't,0.07056022
give away the speech but it's great so what did I think about the film,0.09578797
where does it rank on my thing as you can tell even my dislikes aren't,0.15176968
that harsh for this film because I think this is this is one of my,0.1490864
favorite movies of the year so far so obviously just in saying that when we,0.036791343
rank them what do I rank them is it play it again Sam once is,0.0553033
enough or give me a time stone or like erase my brain for this one,0.49152485
it's it's cut and dry it's very easy play this one again Sam play it,0.06629802
again play it again play it again I really really enjoyed this movie out of,0.09417741
all the hidden gems that I've said for the May of 2019 this is the,0.0416894
one that ranks the highest on that list for me I think everybody should be,0.13129707
seeing this film and I hope I hope that the box office doesn't discourage both,0.10352587
Olivia Wilde as a director cuz I think she does a great job but I,0.1604497
hope this also doesn't discourage or other women and women writers and from getting the,0.13706431
stories for from the female perspective out there because I think they're just as necessary,0.16469277
and I think this might be the one that has to kind of like you,0.1262779
might have to take a couple of bullets that say you know we got to,0.42234576
show you that we can do the same thing or show you that girls got,0.25024968
the same thing as guys girls are still trying to figure out their selves like,0.31089434
guys are before one of these breaks through and you're like okay fine yes we,0.098742016
are all accepting we'll take all of this um I don't it doesn't it doesn't,0.057538282
look like Walker's did that doesn't look like this do that hopefully something comes along,0.07606076
it and these will be just kind of the pebble stones to get up to,0.14997071
that point where we get a film that everyone's like okay they yawa um that's,0.092014335
it you haven't checked it out you should go to the theaters and check it,0.07422677
out it's probably gonna have a limited run at playing at the independent the it's,0.059855193
probably my AMC Theaters but it's playing on the independent circuit of it so I,0.056107476
don't know how long it's going to be there I feel like once the next,0.08976021
big release comes out its gonna get pushed so if you have it in your,0.24106328
theaters go check it out okay those are my thoughts on books mark what did,0.13709971

go check it out but if you have let me know about your comments what,0.16395676
