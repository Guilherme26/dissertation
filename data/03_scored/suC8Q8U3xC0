oh boy what's going on that day YouTube this is SEL zero feature zero representing,0.11956783
James yes I'm about to review the most anticipated movie of the year 2017 Star,0.04726748
Wars the last Jedi here we go all rights to go first off Ron Johnson,0.10546947
de directed looper came on talked about how he was like vicious and wanted to,0.2061441
change the scope of how this movie's gonna be worked as far as the Star,0.06876574
Wars franchise as far as this guy Walker Stan fries then opposite from what they've,0.18910983
been doing with anthology films and then on top of that he's been confirmed doing,0.11005901
his own trilogy from what he was able to do with this I'm very intrigued,0.11259101
what he's gonna do with his own trilogy because he would do if he was,0.15122853
ever the directors very well but let's go ahead to the different things about the,0.05437739
movie from the set pieces from the set designs to the practical effects to the,0.05345302
practical creatures and the lifelike things throughout the entire movie this was a very well,0.07227422
made sci-fi film like as far as just the production design the scope it was,0.06648144
beautiful some of the moments like really surprised me everything with the temple the Jedi,0.088767536
Temple location on the island I thought was just amazing some of the imagery they,0.058050744
were able to do with ray and with Luke and different time jumps and different,0.034019504
thought processes of how things are happening what things are happening are just amazing like,0.07016671
they're very much so inspiring to actually watch and see towards the third egg there's,0.17388019
this one moment on this planet is basically made of salt I've never seen anything,0.14130615
like this in a Star Wars film that off the gate I can promise you,0.08104513
you're gonna be like wow the very opening of the movie there is amazing like,0.07943271
battle sequences some of the probably the best battle sequences they've ever had in any,0.06188542
Star Wars movie and throughout the movie like a the way they actually able to,0.053940516
do the cinematography there were moments I was like yo what's about to go down,0.10170203
the sea this movie is excellent it's actually superb it certain difference extends from the,0.058106244
way they would do certain things I'm trying not to say too much this is,0.0756432
a non school to review of course as far as the soundtrack the soundtrack to,0.078864045
me was better than the force awakens but it doesn't elevate it to that upper,0.060542345
level you know to where I've seen John Williams go but this is definitely a,0.057565723
step up and in the right directions there are certain moments where the music you,0.06377961
change the shifts when there is dialogue between two certain characters and definitely the sequences,0.032734193
wherever is on the island whenever is actually in space and whenever like supreme Snoke,0.115479864
is brought into the fold into this movie I'm not going to talk to you,0.17280489
about anything what the characters are doing but I can definitely say from a performance,0.070368215
standpoint this is definitely Mark Hamill's possibly his best since the Empire Strikes Back performance,0.07346735
of Luke Skywalker like he nails the sky work if you've ever doubted you know,0.16849835
what he was able to do what he should be what you think you should,0.16887248
go regardless of what direction Luke is being platformed into this movie Mark Hamill nails,0.17638284
it Daisy Ridley again powerhouse the sings that it was weird there was one scene,0.09874294
in the dark that surprised me because they really just acted it so well like,0.13479021
that motion was just dripping and it was like a dark sequence I don't think,0.13582069
I've ever seen like a well cried out moment like that in the dark this,0.1496414
actually been filmed um Adam driver was given a lot to do in this one,0.09035311
as far as acting and ability physicality they gave him a lot to work with,0.09737163
in this one um John boyega towards the third act I really loved what they,0.08653819
did with him but as far as what they do with his character that is,0.04956497
where I started getting to nitpicks and possibly negativity standpoint just because of the way,0.07788856
that they platform his arc as opposed to Wade they platform his art in the,0.14938758
force awakens I don't like necessarily what they did with the connection of his character,0.09634514
to everything is happening but I did enjoy the entertainment value of him interacting with,0.093491055
this new carryin rose and what they had to do and him his self-assurance about,0.18734825
who he's supposed to be Pro Dameron had to me a better arc than what,0.084143564
they did with Dom boyega's character and Finn in this one because I can see,0.103857905
where Poe is going you know I'm saying and oh my gosh r.i.p to Carrie,0.16330765
Fisher because see I don't call her goddess but what they were able to do,0.13705376
with her it was beautiful it was beautiful there is a negative that I can,0.29238892
say about what they did with her character in certain instances that I feel like,0.05216181
this is where I get into the negatives of the film I feel like the,0.051643625
film is so ambitious has so much potential of story weight and elevation that I,0.10698639
felt like they pulled back you know I'm saying the punch like there were certain,0.24478172
moments in this movie that like I never saw coming there are certain revelations that,0.07638015
I was just like what but at the end of the day from the storage,0.049418762
standpoint of this movie it was everything that I wanted it to be from the,0.073333554
battles from the action to the process of what the Skywalker's have been dwell with,0.08695144
this whole entire under lock of you know the first order and Snoke like you,0.40334076
get all these boasts of information and these great performances and these consequences that are,0.06533725
built in literally you can see them like right in front of you right in,0.12154731
front of your face but in the end of the day when I leave the,0.5471002
movie there are questions that I'd literally marked on the page of paper like five,0.106679864
different questions only two of those questions got answered and when I was hoping for,0.028273566
and those two questions weren't what I wanted what what I thought were gonna be,0.07730825
and then the other three never got answered it's stuff oh I left the movie,0.08072711
with more questions and because I left the movie with more questions I don't know,0.09046656
where to rank this movie I don't even know if I necessarily can give this,0.087940685
movie a rating but I'm gonna try my best with that because I love business,0.08632341
of this film I love the way it was directed I love the way the,0.075697824
performances were in his movie I love the fights I love the battles I haven't,0.11656992
told you guys anything about the meat of this when I get to my school,0.14951338
review there are certain Easter eggs are certain moments dude they I just cannot Oh,0.14194542
but at the end of the day I can't say that this is the best,0.044585057
a kid I just I personally I personally cannot because of some of the questions,0.12983073
the answers I got to the questions didn't merit of positive reinforcements response and then,0.050317865
some of the questions I happen of course witness didn't get answered and now there's,0.05181174
more questions because now I have no idea where this is going to go and,0.06639395
at the end of the day I put myself in the shoes of those you,0.15101747
know back in the 70s when they looked at between a new hope and Empire,0.03839961
Strikes Back or in-between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi where you just,0.07056902
kind of just like what happens now like that is how I feel and if,0.07747024
you're able to do that and convey that as a director you've done your job,0.117285356
that's why I say that he is merited a franchise because go ahead give me,0.14687379
another trilogy and make me think make me want to have questions but I think,0.15531676
that if some of those questions would have just wait for that gut punch and,0.30042168
just went there and took it specifically there are certain moments in the third eye,0.055374026
I felt like that should have went a totally different way because there are two,0.05839432
different characters and the way that they're gonna be platformer no next is four different,0.059601124
characters and the way they're gonna be platformed next I don't know that it makes,0.0738345
sense and that's all I can say I'll give this move a point five out,0.053864613
of ten I want to give it a nine but I'm gonna wait on that,0.104966894
so I'll rest out of nine but I'll pull back and say eight point seven,0.07379948
it was a really good movie I really enjoyed it thoroughly I cannot wait to,0.1112376
watch it again this is my most anticipated movie this year but I think that,0.052059162
I shouldn't have had as many questions as I do have and that's not to,0.060416587
discourage anybody you're gonna go into this movie you're gonna enjoy you we see this,0.31495345
movie and IMAX the visual effects are great the performances are great you're gonna get,0.06960222
so much out of this and the richness of it you know especially if you've,0.14111246
seen the force awakens and if your songs been this definitely elevates you moving forward,0.10100634
but you're gonna ask yourself a lot of perplexing questions about things that happen with,0.061684143
certain characters things that don't have my certain characters and then questions about the background,0.06114076
of certain characters where I feel like if a little bit of background a little,0.062388454
bit of foundation was kind of like late in this movie for certain characters dude,0.091363646
it would merit anyway you want to take any of these characters personally so that's,0.10598452
all I gotta say hopefully y'all enjoyed this review keeping a lot JVs Wingstop there,0.08836777
will be a full review coming very soon in addition to that on the 17th,0.05865071
we're gonna be doing a spoiler discussion keep it alive JVs we ain't gonna stop,0.15345456
