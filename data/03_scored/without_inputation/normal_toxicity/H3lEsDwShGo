hello Rob here and welcome to R&B reviews well Halloween will be coming up it's just around the corner,0.029802402
so I decided to kick things off by looking at some horror movies both classic or something maybe a recent and I decided to do maybe one or two a week until Halloween rolls around I'm in addition to reviewing horror movies I'm actually getting into the Halloween spirit by wearing shirts see I've got the universal monster movies you've got the Wolfman The Mummy you got the Frankenstein monster or Dracula and The Creature from the Black Lagoon all ready to roll around well,0.3416697
first I decided to kick this series off by looking at a movie that I've actually seen many times and I've been wanting to review for quite some time,0.15344673
and I figured now because anytime than ever I'm gonna be looking at the cabinet of dr.,0.055337913
Caligari this movie came out in 1920 and I'm attack as you as I as you can tell it'll be celebrating its 100th anniversary next year,0.13973196
now this movie is significant in a lot of ways to meet on a personal level,0.08314632
it's actually the first silent movie that I ever saw,0.078342736
now I must have been in middle school,0.07286922
when I first saw that I was just channel surfing one day,0.07242184
and I turned onto a local PBS or Public Broadcasting assistant station my father I was about 10 minutes into it,0.073133245
and I was hooked right up until the end I mean I had heard of silent movies and even my mom had a book that had stills from my family the Opera and way down east and a bunch of other but it never clicked with me that these movies were silent with just you know music and title cards and everything until I actually saw one of these movies so I'm not quite sure why it held my attention at such a young age,0.114844866
I don't know if it the imagery or the suspense of this movie or the fact that I was actually watching a silent movie for the first time I don't know the captain of dr.,0.057273425
Caligari is a German a psychological and thought provoking silent film about Francis he's a young man who visits a travelling fair that just arrived in his hometown,0.18566436
he visits it with his friend Helen,0.08981362
and while there they see this sideshow staged for a hypnotist named dr.,0.11075368
Caligari played by Warner Krauss and his act is basically he has a Sonam beuliss which is a sleepwalker named Caesar,0.11254116
he's played by conrad veidt and wakes caesar up and he can tell your future and any other questions that you might have,0.08560415
but at night Caligari uses him to commit murders,0.44341132
what is striking about this movie is of course the visual look of this film the sets the makeup,0.12505953
the costumes are done to reflect,0.059583813
the madness of the mind of the person telling the story using art directors from Germans film expressionist movement,0.19436854
it has a very dark and twisted visual style of you know the sets and both indoors and outdoors are twisted they are slanted or misshapen,0.31089434
the chairs are very high shadows are painted on the sets along the walls the floors that you know all kinds of places with the performances,0.05490384
I thought that both Krause and I gave very chilling performances as Caligari and Caesar especially you know just from their movements and even their facial expressions,0.15473138
especially when Caligari has Caesar awake for the first time now some say that the acting may be over-the-top but keep in mind,0.06801957
you know that these actors had to convey emotions visually,0.11757181
and since these films are closer to be shown to different countries with different languages everybody can understand a feeling or doing it visually the movie itself,0.11854912
I've seen it quite a number of times and it always keeps me on the edge of my seat and always keeps me guessing and then has twists and turns that you may not see coming,0.0573454
and although I see this movie more as a horror movie some have made,0.18331578
the argument that this is actually an anti Authority film with dr.,0.11101146
Karl Caligari representing the German war government and Caesar represents the conditioned Man like soldiers are trained,0.1539072
basically to kill which kind of makes sense,0.4705939
the census movie did come out at the end of World War 1,0.14502575
and I found out that the writers of the movie were actually passing this,0.060975496
now,0.031218953
what could be said about this movie that hasn't already been said,0.07519194
it's been called the first horror film it's been called the first arthouse film you can definitely sense,0.11251401
its influence in horror movies especially with the universal monster movies that came out in the 1930s and the 1940s like for example terrible things will happen,0.22648905
if you visit a traveling fair like you see in murder and rude morgue with Bela Lugosi or the Wolfman with Lon Chaney jr. the wooden box that the pale and darkly dressed Caesar lays and kind of reminds me of Dracula with Bela Lugosi or when Caesar is lovestruck with the leading lady of the film instead of killing her he abducts her kind of like Frankenstein with Boris Karloff,0.5154597
and of course you know I can see how this this influenced him burned with some of his work as well I think the cabinet of dr.,0.13095926
Caligari is a must-see movie for all kinds of movie audiences including not only silent films but horror mystery suspense and even thought-provoking and complex art house movies,0.1003514
I think that for movie that soon to be a hundred years old it still packs a very scary and chilling pun,0.113408275
the visuals are great,0.05730462
the performances are great,0.048360035
I think that this movie is still compelling all right,0.10307913
