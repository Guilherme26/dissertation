hi everyone its Lissa and this is always in a mashiki the place that encourages,0.037052058
you to go out get dressed up and watch a movie so thor ragnarok stars,0.090987146
Chris Hemsworth Tom Hiddleston Cate Blanchet Tessa Thompson chuckle bloom and Mark Ruffalo and it's,0.035758942
directed by Tycho watt TV and let me say this movie was so much fun,0.059808657
to watch and it was really beautiful it was gorgeous it surprised me with how,0.061330598
incredible the images actually were so I think it is very safe to say that,0.032159634
this third installment absolutely blows the other Thor films out of the water I had,0.064655185
so much more fun watching this so it takes place during the time of Captain,0.02796565
America Civil War and this is when Thor and the Hulk are way from Earth,0.088224635
so this time around the villain is hella who's brilliantly played by Kate Blanchet and,0.0741121
she's taken over Asgard as the goddess of death hella is a formidable adversary as,0.23195487
she's able to destroy it the worst hammer with the least bit of effort much,0.25292927
of the movie is Thor trying to get back to Asgard but he can't do,0.017706523
that before compiling this kind of ragtag group of misfits that can defeat hella and,0.34059942
while that may really sound like guardians of the galaxy I was pleasantly surprised to,0.025376756
find that the tone wasn't exactly the same in these two movies when I think,0.04428593
of guardians I think of Peter quill and how he's a child of the 80s,0.066006176
and it's really sarcastic but it's also a little laid-back in a kind of Motown,0.060172513
vibe whereas this is like a late 70s hard rock space opera and it kind,0.093219504
of reminded me of Shira and he-man two cartoons that I would always watch growing,0.031566955
up in the 80s and so I was happy that the tone wasn't exactly the,0.025711343
same it has its own distinct feeling and much of what makes this work is,0.01779832
that Thor is actually funny and I don't just mean that characters who are surrounding,0.020875458
Thor but I mean Chris Hemsworth is actually funny as Thor so I first realized,0.022592962
that Hemsworth is a funny guy when I saw him in ghostbusters where to me,0.04609257
he was the funniest person in the entire film I feel bad saying that but,0.07056201
I didn't think that was very funny but here he even grows his comedic acting,0.041229412
chops even further and he makes a Thor who is a little bit awkward and,0.15350176
kind of clumsy and a little slightly bit narcissistic I would say uh and I,0.4863326
loved that he was so different in this film from the other ones and they,0.027598469
put him against some really great comedic heavyweights like Jeff Goldblum who is just perfect,0.108804755
in this movie I mean he could not be more perfect as the Grand Master,0.053931095
and the makeup is great my costumes look awesome look awesome and so he gets,0.033877138
to meet the grand master by going to the planets a car won't say how,0.027758114
that happens but it does happen in succour is a place that a lot of,0.14838983
aliens are basically sent so that they can fight in this gladiator style arena and,0.09751925
that's how Thor and the Hulk reunited and so without giving anything more away once,0.014562866
we're brought to Sekar and introduced to the Grand Master the movie definitely takes off,0.022777883
in terms of stories and visuals and then also added to this film is Valkyrie,0.040145162
who's played by Tessa Thompson who once used to be a great warrior but now,0.013338927
is kind of just a drunk but she can still knock out any person that,0.21667759
she meets I will admit that at one point it kind of felt like I,0.04952359
was watching West world because between Tessa Thompson and Anthony Hopkins and then there's another,0.010593049
cameo that I will not name it really did remind me of like oh my,0.03657113
god these are all the characters for my favorite TV show and that's another thing,0.02984147
there are a ton of really fun cameos in this movie that were genuinely so,0.04064139
I had no idea that these people were going to be in the movie so,0.028797796
I'm definitely not going to tell you that right now but these four characters really,0.018843988
do have great interaction with each other and they have a lot of history and,0.04433449
that leads to a lot of funny sequences but I did feel like it never,0.03974073
quite reached that kind of funny but heartfelt tone that Guardians has which is why,0.02916165
I do like guardians better just for that that reason but this movie does boast,0.0376321
one of my favorite villains that I've ever seen in the Marvel Universe I think,0.039364904
Kate Blanchet as hella is just so awesome and evil and funny and she is,0.16764224
this beautiful creature with like these antlers growing out of her and if the costume,0.14859538
was just so so cool and Kate Blanchette to begin with it's just one of,0.0328022
my favorite actresses but she's been given a character where she's really very much involved,0.05504195
in the action and she gets to be in some really cool fight sequences and,0.061111752
she looks amazing while doing it and she's that perfect combination of evil but having,0.20411293
a good bit of fun while being evil and all I know is that I'm,0.15638268
a little bit sad that Halloween just happened because I definitely would have been her,0.08924237
character but now I know for sure who I'm going to be for next year,0.007922337
she just looks awesome in the movie and she is awesome in this movie and,0.04320301
I'll also say that the visuals are outstanding and the artistry is certainly different from,0.012274634
other films in the Marvel Universe it's a much more retro looking color scheme of,0.03610883
like red and white turquoise and white green and white basically anything and white as,0.016376821
well as having many scenes with a complimentary color palette so some of the action,0.017391227
sequences at the end reminded me of the cover to like a wolf mother album,0.05109608
which of course is a throwback to the 70s and let's talk about the action,0.027473414
sequences at the end of the movie because they were awesome they were just so,0.020457057
gorgeous walking and sometimes in the Marvel movies I find the action sequences they're great,0.058224853
I love them but sometimes they're a little bit too long but here I found,0.107220955
myself wanting more which is definitely a good thing and there were certain shots that,0.09420863
reminded me a little bit of like Zack Snyder style and 300 or the Amazon,0.04018308
the Amazons and Wonder Woman because Thor comes in like the lightning bolt that he,0.02307123
was born to be on these diagonals and those shots were just so cool in,0.1012037
it it reminded me even more of like album art from the 1970s and it,0.011675969
was just so different from what I'm used to seeing in these type of movies,0.03349865
and that brings me to the soundtrack so first of all they play Led Zeppelin's,0.07163163
the immigrant song twice in the movie and I was in heaven because that's one,0.07070769
of my favorite songs and it just perfectly fits the tone of the movie and,0.036342975
another criticism that I've heard and I agree with about the Marvel movies is that,0.03638089
the music is not very memorable the score is really nothing to write home about,0.022740634
but here the score is very distinct and it's very retro feeling and it fits,0.02278387
the movie perfectly but that's not to say that I felt every single element of,0.040761787
this movie was perfect it was very very good I really really enjoyed it but,0.07148662
some things that I thought they could have worked on the beginning was a little,0.015776826
bit slow in the pacing I thought it could have moved along a little bit,0.14940424
more maybe even am up this stylized aspect because the beginning isn't quite as cemani,0.025162566
stylized as like the middle and the end were and I also felt that while,0.032701094
the chemistry is really great with all the characters it never really achieves that sort,0.03808908
of heartfelt and genuine moment and I just personally I kind of like a mix,0.0577845
of both and Valerie and Thor they're great at hating each other but I thought,0.22619216
that there could have been a bit more chemistry in their love-hate relationship and it,0.078879476
kind of kills me that a Juris elbows character was not in the movie that,0.36079827
uh he's very summer when he's in the film because he has to be that's,0.031910855
who his character is but I really wish that he was a bigger part of,0.02892418
the script he's such a funny guy in real life he's full of life and,0.17711246
vivacity and I feel like he just Alba just would have fit in with this,0.061411083
group so well and so I wish they had attached his character to the group,0.037674673
it really looked like he was part of the group in the trailers but it's,0.035311274
really just the four characters that are part of that group trying to defeat Hellas,0.019447975
so that one part was also a bit disappointing to me but I'm still really,0.05849226
impressed with marble and the fact that they were able to acknowledge that they had,0.018158847
two misfires with the previous Thor movies and they were able to just change the,0.01320323
tone by 180 degrees I had watched like yesterday I think I watched an interview,0.026099145
where Hemsworth was saying that so much of the dialogue was actually improvised and like,0.012489488
I kind of couldn't believe it because I can't believe that such a big studio,0.037326116
would allow for the actors to improvise the dialogue but that's what makes Marvel better,0.035471585
than DC they're just willing to take chances and try different things with their films,0.04339525
and as a result they're making you know in my opinion much better films than,0.029707767
DC and a lot of that has to do with the director with teeny he,0.013169971
is so funny in general and he's just he's a comedian and he plays Korg,0.03684386
in the movie who's this rock alien and he's very funny as that character but,0.05605569
he had done the mockumentary what we do in the shadows which is so quirky,0.048972152
and oddball and different and he applies that same kind of tone of just like,0.08696345
sheer quirkiness to a Marvel movie and it works so well and I'm glad that,0.07570322
Marvel took a shot with a director who's a little bit smaller that never worked,0.22320071
with such a big budget before because taking that risk is definitely paying off in,0.012047141
their work so now for the grades in terms of film and artistry I would,0.01649323
give Thor Ragnarok a B+ I thought it was so much fun it's beautifully shot,0.25383398
I love the color palette of this movie was just a gorgeous to watch it,0.032155644
also boasts Chris Hemsworth's best performance as Thor ever I actually think this was probably,0.031241015
the best performance I've ever seen him give in a movie and it has a,0.026506238
great villain with Cate Blanchet some of the negatives were the fact that it was,0.06282792
a little bit drawn-out in certain parts I thought the pacing could have been a,0.16593406
little bit better and there could have been a bit more in the characterization department,0.07001524
for me so I wouldn't quite say that this movie was as good as guardians,0.065576464
but it's definitely one of the top Marvel movies that I've ever seen and then,0.04907858
in terms of watch ability which is how much I enjoy the movie well there,0.0122699775
I would give Thor Ragnarok and a because I really enjoyed watching this movie I,0.07470478
think you could tell by now I've really liked to analyze and deconstruct films but,0.018810729
sometimes every once in a while you just want to watch something that's entertaining but,0.03744984
something that's well made and entertaining and the word Ragnarok definitely fills that void to,0.028597575
me like I said it's not as good as guardians like really just my heart,0.09334256
belongs to that movie but this is one of the best and one more thing,0.039431423
if I were DC I would be a little nervous right now because Marvel has,0.033547208
been consistently hitting it out of the park I thought Joe I thought spider-man homecoming,0.15295632
was just so awesome and this film was so much fun I'm going to see,0.02985211
Justice League next week but I kind of can't imagine a world where Justice League,0.017908074
is actually better than Thor Ragnarok I just I can't see it happening I'm gonna,0.02335726
be really open-minded going into it but I'm just not sure and I also thought,0.033218607
that Thor Ragnarok was better than Wonder Woman which i think is their best DC,0.066592865
movie so you know if this was better than their best DC movie we'll see,0.031050773
about Justice League but I hope it's really good I hope they did a great,0.042078853
job with it but thank you guys so much for watching I appreciate it so,0.0140905855
much if you liked the video please like and subscribe leave us comment below I'm,0.03591393
sure so many people are going to be watching this movie so I'd love to,0.03851613
