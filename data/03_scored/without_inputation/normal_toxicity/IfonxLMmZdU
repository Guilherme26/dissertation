hello,0.054463096
this is a Hitchcock review and heads-up there will be spoilers,0.1977266
in the last couple minutes of the video,0.10608981
I will give you fair warning,0.43173367
when I get to that point today I am talking about Rebecca Alfred Hitchcock's 1940 adaptation of the 1938 novel by Daphne du Maurier running 130 minutes stirring Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier this was Hitchcock's first american film and the only one of his films to win the Academy Award for Best Picture it also won for best black-and-white cinematography Rebecca tells the story of a shy awkward English girl working as a paid companion who meets and falls in love with mysterious Maxim de Winter a wealthy Englishman still recovering from the death of his first wife a year ago after a whirlwind romance they marry,0.055820674
and he brings her home to Manderley Manderley sounds better when pronounced with an English accent as Mandalay his sprawling country estate where she finds herself constantly reminded of the woman she's replaced Rebecca whose memory lingers around every corner,0.2466797
it's a spooky romance and an excellently done film the acting and directing photography Franz Waxman score the dreamy atmosphere visually,0.17121468
it's a detailed movie the huge set design of Manderley is imposing and a little fantastic when John Fontaine enters a room my attention is always drawn to the massive size of the door because the handle is placed at such a height as to make her look like a little girl lost in a giant's Palace like I mentioned in my Jane Eyre review I'm extremely fond of Joan Fontaine in these kinds of roles,0.15163222
she was nominated for an Academy Award for Rebecca,0.07030958
but did not win though they let her have it the next year for her performance,0.078176126
in her,0.05223808
second Hitchcock film of suspicion according to legend her co-star Laurence Olivier sword at his wife-to-be Vivien Leigh didn't get the lead was brusque with Fontaine Hitchcock encouraged this behavior and was rough with her himself to provoke an ideal performance this method is questionable,0.122659825
but I can't argue with the results,0.04909539
because as the second mrs.,0.06442155
Dewinter Fontaine is perfect,0.09084877
I sympathize with her awkwardness and insecurities,0.24097635
oh so much,0.0656815
and that makes it intensely satisfying to watch her develop a backbone and find stand up for herself,0.2686711
Laurence Olivier as maximum de winter might be a little younger than the part calls for and the silver,0.099625885
they put in his hair isn't super convincing,0.2918991
but it makes him look very distinguished,0.078158766
and he does a fine job,0.07603792
I think I might have had a little crush on him as maximum de Winter,0.25851104
at some point,0.052111212
when I was 14 maybe I think this is probably my favorite of his performances although his Richard the third is pretty great completely different from this though I can't help wondering of course what it would have been like if Ronald Colman had gotten the part story goes the Hitchcock wanted him for it,0.058042116
and he was interested and even Olivier himself said Coleman should be doing it but Coleman had a scheduling conflict and couldn't going through some highlights of the all-around outstanding supporting cast there's Judith Anderson as mrs.,0.036004547
Danvers the creepiest housekeeper ever no one can touch her performance Menace just flows out of her,0.33890343
she is a creature of hatred and spite with something possibly a little off upstairs,0.65731764
she makes your skin crawl and her scenes,0.5813049
with the second mrs.,0.06456509
Dewinter,0.03358948
in Rebecca's room are move chilling written and choreographed and designed so well there's also George Sanders who did two movies with Hitchcock in 1940,0.13601555
I prefer his more likable character in foreign correspondent to Jack LaBelle but this is a classic example of him playing the unmitigated CAD Gladys Cooper has a relatively small part,0.077037334
but I was struck by how much younger and breezier she seems here than in other things she and neither Bruce are one of the film's brightest spots and I also mentioned Florence Bates as mrs.,0.08006786
Van hopper who's only in it for a short time but leaves her mark I like the moment when Maxim tells her that he's marrying her companion,0.239894
I love reaction shots and that's a fun one as far as faithfulness to the book goes,0.29139227
I guess it's faithful except for a few minor points and one enormous one which I'll get to in a minute,0.09974247
but I'm not really the best judge of faithfulness in this case because I read the book years ago and I don't really remember much about it I don't even remember if I liked it or not I know this story is often compared with Jane Eyre and I will acknowledge that there our similarities since they're pretty obvious but to me Jane Eyre and Rebecca are different they have separate settings and storylines and sets of characters similarities between the two of them are about as common as I would expect to find between any two stories of the gothic romance genre,0.057646785
so I don't dwell on them too much I do have a couple things I want to say that take us into spoiler territory,0.12969336
so here's that fair warning to stop watching now if you need to I don't want to have it on my conscience that I kept someone from watching a good movie by ruining,0.1899471
the ending even if the movie is 76 years old,0.08843962
so continue at your own peril,0.21541761
okay,0.050967902
first here's the enormous change that I mentioned the matter of the crime they change it from murder to accidental death,0.35382792
I guess that's quite a bit different,0.089209035
there's still the issue of getting rid of the body and lying about causes of death but that's so much tamer than actual hands-on murder,0.29798177
I would think Hitchcock of all people wouldn't have been bothered by the original circumstance,0.18935934
so what happened was they're concerned that audiences would be too horrified and reject Maxim is this a censorship thing second,0.08438402
I want to express my appreciation for a scene I consider pivotal to the movie and its central relationship,0.09748665
and that is the confession scene and it's follow-up Maxim de Winter and his young bride don't have the best relationship to him she's a nice little thing amusingly different from his old associations,0.15440969
he does love her,0.09287122
but in a distant often corrective way and secretly he's too damaged to believe her when she says that she loves him and she's too timid to try to draw him out,0.15267861
they both know something's wrong but they can't communicate,0.10355034
well enough to fix it,0.050991252
the confession scene flips everything over she has to track him down to the boathouse where she finds him sitting alone in quiet defeat as he finally tells the truth about the past everything between them is stripped away all pretense and shyness and they see each other with new clarity she's surprised by his vulnerable and he by her loyalty and strength the next scene shows her descending the stairs more smartly dressed and confident than ever before she joins him by the fire and after some more discussion they share their first real kiss of the movie,0.12347731
she has now assumed the role of most intimate confidante trusted with his deepest secret and with the air clear they are free to restart their marriage with a better promise of happiness,0.14764403
I love that and I love the way it's communicated,0.07043811
so that's what I've got to say about Hitchcock's Rebecca,0.093434095
I thoroughly enjoy this movie and I know others do too,0.12885766
so feel free to contribute your thoughts on it because I would love to hear them thanks for watching bye,0.0954466
