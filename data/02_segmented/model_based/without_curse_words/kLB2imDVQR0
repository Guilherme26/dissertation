"Hey guys, it's Mariana and today we're talking about Mad Max Fury Road"
"This movie is directed by George Miller, just like the previous three, and it stars Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult"
"Now I went into this movie with really high expectations because not only wasn't excited after watching the Mad Max trailers, which I thought looked awesome and I never got tired of seeing those trailers, but I also was really hyped up just all my own, because I'm marathoned the first three Mad Max movies right before I went to see Mad Max Fury Road, so I had pretty high expectations for this and this movie still blew my mind"
"I am so excited about this movie that I can't even begin to tell you, and I am obviously going to try to tell you because I'm doing a review"
"but yeah, I'm excited"
My first thought after the movie ended was How am I ever going to watch another action movie Because this film was everything I wanted it to be
"And more, the premise of this movie is pretty simple"
"We have Tom Hardy as Mad Max, who by the way looks fine, who is captured by this group of really strange people who are ruled by a crazy looking dude with a skeleton mask on his face"
You probably remember him from the trailer
You can't miss him
He looks crazy and fun
"Fact, he's actually played by the same actor who played the villain in the first Mad Max movie, Which they're completely different people"
But it's still kind of eight
"So this group of people almost feels like a cult because they pretty much worship their leader And then one of the people there is Shirley's, Erin's character Furiosa And she is actually trying to get out of that situation And so we have her getting out the crazy people chasing her"
And Max is kind of just caught between the two sides
"Now If you have never seen a Mad Max film before, the trailer is a very accurate representation of this movie"
"It is crazy, chaotic, insane, post-apocalyptic action"
That's what this movie is
I absolutely love the world George Miller created for the Mad Max franchise
"It is so weird and so crazy, And if you're somebody who enjoys dystopian post-apocalyptic worlds, I think you're going to find this fascinating"
There are so many crazy details and you can tell that every single thing and every single person in this world has some kind of function like they're not just there to look crazy
They actually have a backstory and a reason to be there
"The action in this movie, like I said before, is mind-blowing It is beautiful"
"First of all, it looks realistic"
It looks like something that can actually happen
It is not all green-screen Cgi
It looks amazing people get hurt
things break
"not that it's great when people get hurt, but you know what I mean like we don't have invincible characters, which is so annoying in action films"
I was legitimately concerned about everybody in this movie because people then just walk things off
"Second of all, there's none of that shaky-cam stuff that is so annoying In movies"
These days you can see everything that's going on
"You can see these beautiful shots of chaos unfolding in front of you, And there is this one particular scene that really had an effect on me for some reason, because it was towards the beginning"
It is a scene where the characters go into a sandstorm and it just looks like all hell broke loose on earth
"This movie also has an amazing soundtrack, which is something that I wondered about because often I see trailers using music that isn't actually in the movie, And I can tell you that the epic music from the trailer is in the movie and it is stunning"
It just all fits together
"There's even a guy in this movie whose sole purpose is to stand on top of this truck while it's driving places, and to play an electric guitar that also spits out fire"
Occasionally
that is how crazy this movie is and I was a big fan of this guy because that was just wild
"Of course, all of the actors did an amazing job"
Tom Hardy as Mad Max is really solid
"I really like Tom Hardy, but I was a little bit concerned about him because Mel Gibson as Mad Max is excellent, but I was pretty impressed"
"Charlize Theron, S Furiosa is pretty much the ultimate badass"
And then Nicholas Hoult plays this really insane character
It's great
They all did a fantastic job
I have nothing bad to say about this movie
"Now, The question that you might be asking yourself is whether or not you need to see the original three movies to watch Mad Max Fury Road, and my answers is yes and no"
"If you're concerned that you're going to be confused about what's going on, like the plot is going to not make sense"
You don't need to see them
This movie stands perfectly on its own
"However, I would definitely recommend seeing the original three movies"
"A, because they're great movies"
"Well, third ones kind of rocky"
but it still has really good moments be
"it's really interesting to observe the progression of this post-apocalyptic world because you can see things getting worse and worse with every movie and crazier and crazier, so that's really interesting"
"and in the second movie Mad Max Road Warrior, you also get to see a little bit of the history of how things happened, So if you're interested in that, definitely see the first three movies"
And also you don't get as much character development with Max in this particular movie
They kind of go over his origins a little bit in the beginning
"However, if you want to know how this guy went from a pretty normal person who was a reckless cop to this insane shell of a man, you obviously need to watch the previous movies, so for plot, you don't really need to see them, but you really should see them now, guys, because I'm apparently a very mean and demanding movie watcher and reviewer"
I have not given a single 5 out of 5 rating to a movie that I saw that came out this year and Mad Max Fury Road gets five out of five stars from me
It happened
That's it for my review
"Obviously, I think you guys should absolutely go see this movie in theatres as soon as you can"
It is awesome
"I definitely want to see it again and I will definitely be buying it on Blu-ray to add to my collection, Because I need this movie in my life"
"If you have seen Mad Max Fury Road already, please let me know what you thought about it and we can talk about it in the comments below and let me know how do you think it compares to the original three Mad Max films"
I hope you guys enjoyed the review
Thank you so much for watching
"Please don't forget to give the video a thumbs up if you liked it, and also subscribe to my channel"
"If you haven't already, I would really appreciate that"
I hope you're having an amazing day and I will see you soon in my next video
Bye
