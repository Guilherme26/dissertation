hey everyone today,0.047740776
I've got your Roma movie review the follow-up to gravity comes a movie that is generating major awards buzz but is is it a clear winner so as far as the story goes Alphonso cons arrested spanish-language film that I watched on Netflix now it is set in the early 1970s in Mexico City where this movie grasps the major events that unfolded during at that time because they show some writing going on while focusing on a woman who is who has to adjust to many changes in her life,0.09893364
and this is all seen through the lens that rarely moves on screen as much as the story does and it is sure to capture audiences so if you haven't seen this movie whether you saw it last year or if you have Netflix you can watch it there,0.016123595
and this is not your average movie that contains a big budget and even though the scope alone would make you think,0.09631599
otherwise I mean there is so much going on in this movie but it is made with a simplicity,0.10496732
yet complete with details that make up this fascinating world that this woman and the family she works for lives in and I think it's just pretty entertaining to watch in that aspect,0.1936219
so as far as the casting goes you've got Galicia Aparicio who plays this young woman named Cleo and she works as this nanny / housekeeper for this woman and she eventually experiences this life-altering event the constant of make certain decisions in her,0.2252053
life and I think you know for a newcomer actress I think she was very good in we'll definitely a standout performance for award season and one that even though you don't hear a lot from her it's all in the emotion the performance itself that draws you in to her,0.069345824
character and the things that she goes through because there's like just so many things going on with her character that you're just literally following her around and figuring stuff out as the movie,0.060575034

love,0.05277203
it was obviously I had mentioned this in my trailer Thursday video for this movie the cinematography alone is what made me want to see this movie it is so beautifully shot,0.24899466
it's in black and white so it's very unique and refreshing to see in a movie like this,0.15088238
I feel like the in last movie that I saw in black and white that was even up for awards consideration was Nebraska that was also really good,0.024980966
and I also enjoyed the fact that it wasn't just a series movie it was a serious movie in a sense of certain issues that were being brought up but it was also slightly comical,0.077387586
so it wasn't just this long drawn-out movie where we're like okay,0.08671943
it's in black and white there's just so much going on that you feel like you have to pay attention to it,0.16786174
it's so detailed but it is exactly what goes on that makes it so light-hearted,0.07687318
and like I said going through the motions especially a scene in the third act really just brought me to tears and it just made me so emotional to watch you know the progression of the character,0.072873734
and what this movie was all really about in the end,0.08721085
but unfortunately the things that I didn't really like about this movie was that some parts of the movie were slow and it was expected because you know there wasn't any true like musical score and some parts of it we're really boring to watch however I was engrossed with the store and I really tried my best to really get into it otherwise so overall,0.07941667
I would say that this movie was pretty impressive to say the least and one that I didn't think I was going to enjoy,0.078331366
but after I saw it I definitely enjoyed myself watching it,0.082723305
so I'd highly recommend seeing this movie if you guys haven't it's definitely if I had seen it last year probably would have made my top 10 list,0.09578701
