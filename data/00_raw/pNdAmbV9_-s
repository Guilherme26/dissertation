so a quiet place part 2 comes out this week so i figured i'd review the original or quiet place from 2018. real quick if you enjoyed the video don't forget to like and subscribe and tell me what you thought of the video down below in the comments and what you think of a quiet place uh and are you excited for a quiet place part two and this is gonna be a spoiler video it's not gonna have too many spoilers but i will be talking some spoilers from a quiet place so if you haven't seen it i recommend you see it before you watch this video anyways let's get into it so in 2018 this movie really took everyone by surprise when john krasinski obviously you know from jim as jim from jim in the office so he directed a horror movie starring him and his wife uh where essentially there's these monsters who can't see but they can hear and they have really good hearing so if you make a noise they're going to kill you and so this movie's really about that and like the family's survival with that concept but overall this movie is terrific this is my third time watching it and honestly it gets better every single time john kozinski takes this kind of simple concept of you know these monsters that can only hear you and they basically hunt with what they hear um it's he takes that simple concept and really flushes it out to perfection with really a really deep story that has a lot about like family dynamics and really very a creative story with how he treats this concept of these monsters but first this movie works so well as a horror film in the horror genre first off it just feels very horror modern you know 2010's horror with how it's shot it just it just feels that way but also it's pretty scary at times it's not like super scary it's not like the scariest movie i've ever seen but it is pretty scary at times but it's really more terrifying and suspenseful with that's kind of the nature of the movie the concept of if you make a sound you're gonna die that's real a really terrifying idea and the idea is really done perfectly and really creatively like i mentioned like the stuff with the waterfall where you can talk around the waterfall as long as it's louder that's really creative and really all the like the cool stuff with like the lights and all these like the fireworks and all this different stuff i have at the farm to kind of combat this enemy i think it's it's really creative with what they do here and that's definitely nod to the writers and the director as they just they do this concept really well and that's one of the biggest strengths of this movie that made it so great is that it's just you take the simple concept and develop it so much to you just make it perfect like i've always loved the opening scene alone where you know the kid has like the rocket ship and he just like turns it on and he just gets killed by the monster john krasinski's running towards him it's a super like bold opening um for a movie and i um it's really sad and it's really terrifying but i really love it it's such a good opening to a horror film i think i really want the best in my opinion when it comes to your crazy openings to really set the tone of the movie and it does that perfectly but overall this movie is just you know terrific with the suspense and with just how scary the monster is but also this movie is very dramatic with the concept obviously you know you have the daughter who's deaf and you really have you know the family dynamic with that with john kasinski trying to you know get make her a hearing aid and really um she ends up obviously she's responsible for the kid dying in the beginning so then there's a dynamic with that throughout the movie and then the wife is pregnant um and there's a dynamic through that so there's a lot of like drama elements mixed in here that also complement the story very well in my opinion and it really it gets pretty emotional towards the end of the movie obviously with john krasinski you know getting killed and sacrificing himself to save his kids in the movie and then when you see exactly how much he was doing for his kids and for his deaf daughter obviously making the hearing aids you know it gets pretty touching and heartwarming towards the end of the movie with you just you see how much he was doing for them and that definitely really helped the movie i think and it's just it's really nice how they blended so much drama into you know a horror movie about a monster it's pretty a nod once again to the director and the writers um with just how well they did that and the family elements just work so well in this movie and it definitely enhances the movie and takes it that next step in my opinion the acting from pretty much all four or four leads i believe is really good as well i mean you just get this really they all pull off this really intense performance particularly emily blunt and john krasinski into two like adult lead roles this they really convey the the the the tone of the movie just the suspense and just how terrifying this world is um they really do a good job at conveying that and that just once again it just helps the movie just be this you know really almost a masterpiece of what they did here with this movie but the acting in this movie is just terrific but possibly the best element you know obviously the most no the kind of biggest takeaway from this movie was the sound and the sound editing and the sound mixture and everything because obviously you have these those dead quiet scenes where they're kind of they're being hunted and they just don't can't make a sound um then you really mix that with you know these kind of small noises that they're you know that they're allowed to make throughout the movie and then you also mix that with like the score of the movie they mix that in there as well um at different scenes throughout the movie but this the sound editing is in sound mixing is incredible in this movie and it's just really like next level type stuff and it's like unbelievable what they're able to pull off with that and once again i'll go back to it a lot but it just it helps convey the tone in the mat in the point of the movie with just like these monsters hunting these people it really helps with that when you just you have the sound which really is the most terrifying aspect of the movie but just how well it's done and it really just makes you really terrified for these characters as he really really pulls you in so overall this movie is just really an amazing horror film in my opinion but my only negative with the movie and it's kind of sort of a negative i think it could have used a little more development the movie is only 90 minutes and about half of the movie is the final act of the movie with emily blunt having the having the baby which is really the main kind of arc in the movie um so that's really that that's like half the movie i just wish there was a little more um obviously this movie's really good so i do wish there was just more and more it was longer in general because 90 minutes is pretty short especially for a movie like this that move tends that does move really quickly um so i wish and i think the emotion would have hit harder in this movie if there was just more a little more character development it is pretty good everything is pretty good i just think it could have been a little better in that regard not a huge issue for this movie just something i can i kind of i wish there was a little more development for pretty much everything in the movie but once again not a huge deal with the nature of this movie and really like the sound stuff and you know these monsters that can only hear those are going to be plot holes and you know people are going to point those out but i'm not going to go in depth with those you probably already know what they are um and i don't really like i don't personally really care about them the movie is terrific in my opinion i don't really feel a need to nitpick the plot holes they do hold the back a little bit just because there is some like the pregnancy during this whole situation it's kind of a little kind of frustrating um but it's like that that definitely adds to the movie the pregnancy that's the the concept that make one of the most intense concepts of the movie so i'm completely fine with it i get it um i don't want to pick the the plot holes in the movie but it's they're definitely present and there might bug people more than they bug me personally i'm pretty fine with it but anyways like i've kind of alluded to this whole video on this movie is just really good as a horror movie but also as a suspense kind of thriller kind of movie and as really like as a drama the drama elements also really work here it's just terrific from the acting to just how they treat the concept to the sound editing and obviously that great sound editing how well that conveys the tone of the movie it's just everything in this movie works and it's really it feels like a movie that shouldn't work but it just works so well and it's really a nod to john kozinski here who does a terrific job in directing the movie um and it's just this movie is just an incredible experience it's really endlessly rewatchable i might have to watch it again before a quiet place part 2 comes out because it's just it's so good and this it's really short and that makes it really easy to watch um i know i complain about it being underdeveloped but it being 90 minutes also makes it a really quick watch like this movie flies by it feels like 30 minutes when you watch it because it just there's it's so much happens in this 90 minute period so anyways i think this movie is really really good so i'm going to give a quiet place 90 and 4.5 out of 5 stars i think it's definitely deserving it doesn't quite reach 5 stars for me maybe it will one day i hope it does one day as it gets better with every watch but right now i'm just gonna give it four and a half but like i said this movie is just an incredible and unique experience and it's just you know it's one of the best horror movies that we've gotten in recent years and i endlessly enjoy watching this movie but anyways that's going to do it for my review of a quiet place i can't wait for a quiet place part 2 here at the end of the week um and if you enjoyed the video
