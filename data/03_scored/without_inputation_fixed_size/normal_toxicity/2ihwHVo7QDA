spoiled heiress and Adel an unemployed crack reporter who end up on the same bus,0.51709753
to New York blankets hitchhiking and carrots ensue now look in many ways it's kind,0.13866672
of amazing that this film actually exists at all the only people who were interested,0.07510337
in getting it made were Frank Capra and Robert Riskin Harry Cohn ran Columbia studios,0.07998125
and Columbia Studios was the poor cousin of the big studios Frank Capra sort of,0.19545522
bluffed his way into Hollywood and ended up getting a job at Columbia studios he,0.14437824
lasted there because he had an engineering background and he was able to cope with,0.09801589
the coming of sound much better than a lot of other directors he did eventually,0.14907058
become Columbia's most important director but still Columbia didn't have a fancy-pants reputation and most,0.07475469
of its movie stars in its films were borrowed from other studios rather than being,0.022726031
kept on the books so they offered the role of Ellie Andrews to Myrna Loy,0.074335605
Carole Lombard constance bennett Margaret Sullivan and Miriam Hopkins who also know then they offered,0.09975006
the role to Claudette Colbert she said new Warner Brothers wouldn't loan betty davis out,0.12409499
they went back to Claudette Colbert said okay we'll pay you double your salary and,0.1310486
it will only take four weeks to film she said yes for the male lead,0.15385768
Peter Warren they offered the role to Robert Montgomery he said nearer then Louis be,0.04147706
mayor who was the head of MGM studios came to Harry Cohn said you can,0.102812
have Clark Gable now big studios tended to loan out their famous movie stars to,0.056712233
Columbia when they done something wrong it was kind of their version if you go,0.10993596
to your room and you just think about what you've done Clark Gable wasn't thrilled,0.1526969
but he didn't have any choice filming began and everybody thought the thing was gonna,0.0742505
be a huge flop they'd been a number of bus films made recently and it,0.25668767
looked like this was just to try and catch in on the whole bus thing,0.107378274
kind of a deal Claudette Colbert apparently complained about everything every single date when it,0.10148929
came out it wasn't an immediate surefire success it was pulled from a lot of,0.0917934
the major cinemas the ones that it did stay in a group grew word of,0.05536375
mouth spread and it became a solid hit and then when it was nominated for,0.12624185
the top five Oscars for Best Picture Best Director Best Actor Best Actress and Best,0.020573419
Adapted Screenplay everyone just about fell down and then when it won when it scooped,0.094475985
the pool well to quote Wallace Shawn it was inconceivable there wasn't very good anyhow,0.08569764
and consider you know what I mean Claudette Colbert did not attend the ceremony she,0.15335555
was on a train to go on holidays they pulled her off the train the,0.09937636
Columbia execs got her to the ceremony she said thank you in her traveling clothes,0.124849685
when got back on the train again it was it was extraordinary now this film,0.09379024
was made just before the production code came into being like you know five months,0.1003567
or so before and as a result it's got a much freer feel than a,0.1060977
lot of the films made to slightly afterwards and also gets away with a whole,0.06788481
lot of dialogue that wouldn't have been that comment afterwards incidentally it happened one night,0.06712477
had an enormous influence on the creation of Bugs Bunny Fritz Freeling who came up,0.17503634
with Bugs Bunny loved this film watched it over and over and over and Bugs,0.10571782
Bunny is sort of surefire patter was very much influenced by both Oscar Shapley and,0.18403263
Clark Gable's method of speaking the way that Clark Gable ate carrots informed how Bugs,0.102944165
Bunny ate carrots and there's also the mention of a bugs in the film as,0.14137122
well which sort of led onto the whole thing this film has a real less,0.21720508
is more approach and it works it's sexy the scene where Ellie and Peter are,0.24068625
lying in separate beds in the same room with a blanket between them and the,0.23574644
moonlights shining down on them and they're there musing about life it is it's sexy,0.5249922
piece of work it's one of the loveliest things there is on the screen to,0.0883399
watch one of the things Claudette Colbert complained about a lot was well legs she,0.3220036
was supposed to show her legs in the film and she said I'm not showing,0.35046157
my so if I got a stunt double in and then she didn't like the,0.13501702
stunt doubles legs and she said though that is not my leg pride one out,0.22167322
it's her own leg that you are seeing in this film and then Clark Gable,0.13945244
apparently brought the sails of men's undershirts plummeting down to the ground because he takes,0.23975687
his shirt off in the film he's not wearing an undershirt went through their doubts,0.21392705
I'm not having any of this look out for Alan Hale in this film now,0.088999085
he's best known as Little John in The Adventures of Robin Hood made a number,0.051821943
of films with Errol Flynn but he's also very well known for being Alan Hale,0.10001197
jr. 'he's father and an Alan Hale jr. is the skipper on Gilligan's Island the,0.09020125
scene where Peter and Ellie attempt to fool the detective on Ellie detectives on Ellie's,0.42585695
trail that they're not really there is dynamite this the film really feels much younger,0.07272145
than it is in a way that the mismatched roadtrip couple is such a common,0.105708756
theme now filming Lee but these are the two who originated the whole thing the,0.059637763
spark and the chemistry of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert no matter what a kind,0.09879771
of a time they were having making the film is so so real so dynamic,0.07229177
that it draws you in the few glimpses of depression-era life that Frank Capra gives,0.149708
you in this film also give you a glimpse of a whole group of people,0.21476598
just trying to get by in the world and it really that's what brings it,0.053383842
closer to us now because in essence we're still all really just trying to get,0.07076744
by now watch it for the walls of Jericho watch it for the bus sing-along,0.061890133
that's great watch it because it makes sleeping on high seem romantic and not itchy,0.10519516
