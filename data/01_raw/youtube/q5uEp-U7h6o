[Music] what up peeps Tony Baker here back with another movie review this time I'm reviewing the irishman martin scorsese the epic netflix saga that they slid out to theaters this three it's three and a half hours long guys but it reunited him with Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci once again we all know they made magic with casino and Goodfellas there's a straight magic Goodfellas is easily hands-down one of my favorite movies of all time so it's my by default my favorite Martin Scorsese movie Robert DeNiro plays Frank Sheeran who's a you know real life character who you know worked with mob you know we're very closely with Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci who they brought out of retirement for this joint Joe Pesci's been shelling he's been I'm out the game this one I think I'm out they pull me back they blue leave a key and they say like Robert and Martin had to really convince him to come do this movie that must be nice man you when you're good you just walk away from the game for years be like I don't know like you're settled you said you don't need the money whatever and then you can demand whatever you want if legs look give me seven million dollars to do this movie and Netflix like we had money this movie costs a hundred and fifty million dollars to me a hundred and fifty million dollars for drama this is ridiculous man man yeah I bet you Joe was like give me 75 million dollars and there's our joke come on please Netflix man we bottomed the Soviet baby man three and a half hours 150 million this is better be good excuse my language but man you know and the critics loved it they was like yo this is a masterpiece oh and how can I forget who else is in this Al Pacino so you got Alba Chino Robert De Niro Joe Pesci in one move I'm saying the last time Al Pacino or Robert De Niro all together real righteous kill we just go forget about that that movie was hot guy hot righteous kill was a hot garbage it was like somebody took some garbage boiled it added some seasoning you know there's an old here the garbage put in the bowl and served it hot but he that's the Pacino De Niro combo that we all love so it's good to see them back again it's really the story about a guy Frank Sheeran he's Irish and he starts doing like you know jobs with mob-connected men he starts you know rising up the ranks doing doing odd jobs or isn't it then kind of doing hits a little bit you know I want to put a business out there but you know doing some real dirt and doing what he ever had to do for them essentially it's like I'll do it I'll do it I'll do it you know I mean and so you still get that Scorsese you know people getting capped we've come to expect like you know people getting shot up you know this in here well at three and a half hours it's gonna be the slow pace it's a slow pace it's a slow pace like because it goes through all these years ago it goes and so they're using this special effects thing the D age you know the actors and make them look older make them look younger so they're doing all of this and some people thought it was distracting I really didn't bother me too much I was just like okay I couldn't they never really made Robert De Niro look young no like he was supposed to be mad long ago he was still looking old so they were trying to make him look young and they kind of fumbled now I'm like he's still look old but just smooth the skin that's all it was he was an old man with smooth skin it's like yo this is me in my 20s and he looked like Robert De Niro in his seventies with smooth skin that's the only the only thing I really saw so basically is that and you know you you get to see Robert De Niro's family how his daughter looked at him and I thought that was a really interesting dynamic within the story is just how how his kids viewed what he was doing because a lot of times you don't really see that you see you know these guys have families of course but you don't really see like a kid that really doesn't like what you're doing and knows it because kids man we out here man we we we see what our parents do and it affects us for them to really play on that I really enjoyed that aspect of it because it was like yo I don't I don't like what you're doing you know cuz a lot of times kids don't feel like they have any place to say that to their parents or they just hold it in or they just become what their parents were but it's good just to see like I'm not feeling this from a little girl throughout you know understands just to see that transition Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa he killed it in this movie he nailed it you know a lot of times Al Pacino can go over the top he's been going over the top you know in his later roles all right man just this dial it back a little bit no I will not you know but in this it worked because that's the type of person Jimmy Hoffa was but if you look up Jimmy Hoffa like he was fiery like he you know he got the union's really going like he was one of the main guys in the country like it was the president then like Jimmy Hoffa and so what he was doing was really big really important and so I felt like you needed that type of delivery for Jimmy Hoffa and I thought he nailed it I thought he was a doe very stubborn but a dope character to watch you were all in and you kind of respect how he wasn't scared of the mob I like to see that even though most of the people in movies they just bow down to the mob you know it was it was interesting to see a character that even though they can hurt you he still never really backed down and I thought that was pretty dope Joe Pesci's character you know usually Joe Pesci in the Martin Scorsese movie he's the hotheads fireball short Wolverine I kill you right now I kill you what's funny in my job to you was funny you know just a hot Headz volcano now he's completely subdued quiet you know still we'll get you cue but it's very like understated quiet but when he's around you feel the presence of like you know danger like serious business I can hurt you I can get things done and I love how Joe Pesci played it very understated very chill very quiet and it's like yo it works and so you know a lot of people are clowning it this long and slow but I think they really just focusing on the wrong things like you know even though the the age of fire didn't really work all right it didn't work but I could still focus on the story and the performances and I feel like it was a good time I don't I don't agree with what Martin Scorsese said about comic book movies I'm not here for it you know I think comic book movies are great cinema you know you getting emotions you go in there you're crying you're excited you're on the edge of your seat you're laughing what the hell else do you want from movies you going there for to feel something and you know Marvel movies have been providing that you know Martin every day know I had to be all serious and like you know drawing from real people's it's about what you connect to the hell if that's the case you know Shakespeare you know the stuff he wrote Romeo Giulia there weren't real people but everybody's been connecting with that format long so Martin just chill man let's get these comic-book movies man we having a good time out here in these Marvel streets DC you know - Joker and the Dark Knight not not the Justice League because we all fumble see but man we having a good time with these Marvel movies Martin man you watch it for the last Marvel movie Martin Scorsese watched cuz I guarantee you if you watch infinity war and endgame man you gonna feel something you know I'm gonna watch him watch it and see how can you not feel this dunk how can you not connect anyway man y'all want to know the smooth jazz review an Irishman here it is oh yeah I'm giving the Irishman four saxophones out of five four again four saxophones again what y'all gonna do self is quality though its quality out I think Martin was just mad cuz Marvel made a three-hour movie he's like I'm the one that's making the three-hour movie oh I can't call alright a piece that's my review of the Irishman let me know what you thought of
