an animated film like I've never seen before so let's talk about in the film,0.037444517
Miles Morales is bitten by a radioactive spider in gains incredible powers before he masters,0.033946984
his abilities he's thrust into an adventure to save all of reality from kingpins evil,0.10451631
schemes along the way he meets several people who have powers similar to his own,0.07508261
so I actually saw this one back on Saturday but as soon as I got,0.035176907
home from seeing it I was just wiped out sick for a couple of days,0.17178367
so I've been wanting to talk about this one and with that in mind go,0.04497772
ahead and join me down in the comments section if you've seen it what did,0.03862123
you think about it once you see that tell me what you thought about it,0.02611777
let's have a nice lively discussion with that said let's get started talking about the,0.023902709
good and the first thing that comes to mind with this movie is the look,0.03481172
I have never seen a movie that looks like this before and that's very much,0.025980078
a good thing they found a way to create this visual style that feels like,0.037512366
a comic book come to life whether you're talking about the low framerate the way,0.12418114
they framed the shots the way the characters are just animated and drawn all of,0.049917378
it looks like a comic book and then beyond that inside of the story there's,0.03791214
comic book page turns there's framing devices where it zooms in on a frame and,0.058757666
that goes to another shot there's elements where words appear on the screen so many,0.049103193
different things that I've just never seen something like this and so it's just a,0.01860452
real delight to see this movie except for kingpin I did not like the look,0.06825715
of kingpin we'll get to that and a little bit later but otherwise this is,0.058929283
a movie that is just so creatively drawn in a new way to animate a,0.027006457
film along those same lines the visual style meshes perfectly with the type of story,0.034379352
that they're telling it's very comic book II when they're incorporating spider-ham and spider noir,0.027267208
inside with Miles Morales and Peter Parker and to do that they picked a visual,0.024712238
style that allows you to suspend disbelief in this context in a way and just,0.03533522
go along with the story the combination of visual style and storytelling style create all,0.026984505
these new opportunities to create a unique experience that is probably the most comic book,0.027922414
II film I've ever seen another great thing about the film is the humor it,0.011876189
has a very sharp wit in a very diverse sense of humor a lot of,0.03832389
the humor comes from kind of poking fun a little bit at the Spider Man,0.07339237
movie franchise but other aspects kind of tie into the different individual characters so spider-ham,0.026127748
has big broad humor and then spider and war has this very dry self-serious sense,0.07726773
of humor but in general it's just a clever script where the setups the running,0.02039453
gags and then the callbacks they all pay off including a fantastic after credit sequence,0.05855146
but of course with ties it all together are the characters Myles burrows leads the,0.042280402
pack and it's fun to get to see this new spider-man take the lead and,0.07647217
how his family dynamics shift the way this character becomes a here and what that,0.018864607
looks like inside of his life perspective but all the side characters are given their,0.022320237
unique moment to shine the unique spot inside of the script no one's annoying in,0.024510687
a bunch of them like spider-ham spider noir Aunt May are all scene stealers my,0.16247045
personal favorite was Peter be Parker I went in a little bit skeptical from the,0.04376975
terms like what are they doing with Peter Parker but inside of the story they,0.017868828
explain where he's coming from certain choices that he's made that have brought him to,0.01718635
a specific place and they give him a really powerful arc that I thoroughly enjoyed,0.015178826
from beginning to end once I saw what they were doing with the character but,0.008626102
what really surprised me was how developed the villain set was kingpin is impressively threatening,0.07507396
as well as characterized for a PG movie what table to get away with ends,0.055902697
making him a dangerous villain where there's real stakes while keeping to a PG rating,0.10955974
is actually pretty impressive for the modern era beyond that his motives are clear we,0.023993839
know what he loves we know what he values we know what he will do,0.025562342
to get what he loves the other villains and the mix some of the side,0.052656602
villains also tie into the story in different ways that I don't want to go,0.037505716
into for spoiler reasons but all of it feels like a great set of villains,0.13167709
from there let's move on to the mixed aspects of this film and the big,0.016902981
thing that comes to mind here is that the film follows certain familiar formulas and,0.0068573784
templates in regards to team-up movies as well as story arcs about a new hero,0.029996457
on an adventure with more experience here as you've seen some of these beats before,0.048664834
you can predict generally when certain things are going to happen in the mix and,0.030559203
it's obviously not a good thing I don't think it's a particularly bad thing because,0.030888468
the rest of the movie has a lot of creativity to it but if you're,0.11528431
someone that's very sensitive to kind of familiar beats and things like that it could,0.024517339
be a problem for you from there let's move on to the negative and the,0.02995987
big thing that comes to mind is the design of kingpin every time he showed,0.04224515
up on screen it was distracting for me because I just don't like the way,0.052922677
they drew him with how physically wide he is it just looks out of place,0.17980778
with the rest of the designs for me so I did not like it and,0.059586484
the other thing is that penny Parker seemed underdeveloped the other characters seemed to get,0.056958344
more of their moments to shine you got a little taste of who they were,0.07648814
a little bit more and she seemed like the one a little bit further in,0.09441218
the background and so she should have gotten a little bit more time on screen,0.044210102
that's it this is a very fun movie a very unique experience I have never,0.031139906
seen a movie like this before it's very cool that we live in a time,0.05407211
