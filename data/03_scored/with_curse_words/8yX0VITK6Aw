today we are going to be beginning our discussion of five star plus movies now,0.059040662
a five star plus movie isn't just a good movie and it isn't just a,0.06982011
great movie it's a movie that makes you stand in awe because of how incredible,0.08340921
the art of filmmaking can be a five star plus film is one that has,0.05079833
left its mark on the film industry one that when you look at the modern-day,0.059443675
movie these are the reasons that it's there today I'd like to make one of,0.124172896
these movies every month as we look at the best that cinema has to offer,0.072323926
first one we are going to be looking at is a very surreal German expressionistic,0.2335552
film called the cabinet of dr. Caligari now this is a fantastic early horror film,0.09309519
that was released in 1919 so I will be discussing spoilers but seeing as this,0.06592686
film is nearly a hundred years old if you haven't seen it now I think,0.08848635
it's the time to do so so without further ado let's look at the magic,0.08654182
that is the cabinet of dr. Caligari the film officially begins when we see these,0.06145535
two men talking now one of them we are soon going to find out his,0.3386248
name Francis and he is going to be our main character the other is just,0.041042298
a man who he is able to tell his story to all the sudden a,0.07978476
ghostly figure appears and Francis tells the other that that woman is his wife and,0.13582642
he begins to tell the story of how she became the way that she did,0.06493887
let's take a moment to appreciate that this is a nonlinear narrative released in 1919-20,0.044181284
two years before Citizen Kane in 75 years before Pulp Fiction which are both two,0.055235438
films that are known for innovating the nonlinear style but this did it long before,0.08099604
either these were around the film cuts to the town where one of the men,0.070293546
grew up and we see this incredible backdrop this is probably what the film is,0.033346746
best known for these vivid and surreal images that really show that you're living in,0.08730205
a world with different rules you're out looking at Germany you're looking at something very,0.14849676
different and the choice of backgrounds helped make this movie so much better shadows were,0.04218585
colored in everything that you're seeing was hand-drawn it really shows that this is the,0.093103066
art of filmmaking the background also shows the oppression of the German regime all of,0.24120867
the houses are built on a hill with the castle on top of it showing,0.0666576
the oppression of the common folk by those in charge and those with wealth we,0.08370834
are introduced to really our main antagonist dr. Caligari and what this film did so,0.057928465
well was used this film to tell the story instead of describing an evil man,0.35538977
you can actually see him this is really the first time that cinema as an,0.09198627
art was able to show not only art but also storytelling this shot in particular,0.12284145
reminds me of a dr. Seuss drawing now albeit this is the scariest dr. Seuss,0.075162195
drawing out there but you see the man in power sitting on an unreasonably large,0.14887027
chair leaning over as it checks the public records or on a podium that has,0.07239148
literal symbols on it you don't need to be a genius to pick up some,0.1548026
stereotypes about an oppressive regime and knowing what we know about Germany between World War,0.18417315
one and World War two he may be saying something about the government later we,0.15346156
find out that the town clerk has been killed obviously we know who the perpetrator,0.43772826
is and this tells us so much about dr. Caligari after the town clerk made,0.04008543
him wait for only three minutes he was killed this shows that dr. Caligari is,0.52774566
not someone to be trifled with at the fair which is essentially a metaphor for,0.07713449
consumerism dr. Caligari sets up his psalm universe and draws a remarkable crowd by telling,0.07138348
about his creature after hearing about the wonders of caesar we were finally told about,0.119812936
him he is 23 years old who has been asleep for the past 23 years,0.105957046
we see the creature and Oh God look at that haircut look I get he's,0.18449517
been asleep for 23 years and this was 1919 I come on a bowl cut,0.10686438
and all reality however actually really loved this shot shows the pride dr. Caligari has,0.09725216
for Caesar it almost looks paternal this is Caligari his way of making money and,0.06685378
killing his enemies it's all captured in this one shot Caesar wakes up and his,0.8415175
23 years of sleep Caesar began to learn everything present past and future people begin,0.08768826
to ask questions and this part really shows off human greed through wanting to obtain,0.35664445
the impossible like knowing how long you are live your ultimate li and knew your,0.19405827
life later that night we see our protagonist being murdered and this is shown through,0.31089434
the use of shadow obviously the MPAA wasn't around in the 1920s but there were,0.055460054
some guidelines his phone was able to get around these guidelines by using shadow which,0.070399515
is very innovative his friend Frances remembers what the prophecy was and now the film,0.035738982
is about to get good Francis reports this theory to the law but is still,0.05398728
unsatisfied he decides to go after Caesar and eventually Caligari himself the law catches up,0.15215944
with Caligari and they question him and he's chosen that Caesar is still there and,0.053806875
assures him that he has been asleep ever since the fair that day and he,0.19400018
will not rise without him anyway but the murder is revealed by someone else and,0.19595487
Caligari is say at this point Jane the woman from earlier meets dr. Caligari who,0.09765152
shows her Caesar who wakes up and this is without a doubt one of my,0.17926276
favorite scenes in the film there was something so great about the way the Caligari,0.030577427
and Caesar look at her as she runs away it is so unsettling and so,0.16745974
great that combined with the great score shows off some excellent excellent filmmaking and our,0.04991361
next scene which is ultimately a collection of different clips that all happen at the,0.08315336
same time francis is checking in to see what dr. Caligari is doing he sees,0.07755343
him with Caesar the next part of the scene however shows Caesar breaking into Jane's,0.08085808
house with his knife this is so unsettling so creepy and one of my favorite,0.4908108
scenes in horror history one of people's biggest complaints with us movies that you see,0.13396908
very dry camera angles every shot is long drawn out and for the most part,0.2519705
almost stationary but it works so well in this movies you see Caesar approach the,0.06337783
bed knife in hand you see someone line there asleep someone coming to murder her,0.7195056
there's nothing you can do about it as an audience member nothing anyone can do,0.08680609
about it I'm certain most people are familiar with dramatic irony that Shakespeare perfected which,0.07061811
the audience knows something that the characters inside the play do not know however this,0.051981173
is the best case of dramatic irony when you're seeing someone about to be murdered,0.51620215
and there's nothing you can do about a Caesar approaches the bed you can just,0.15276812
see how well the shot is friend so well execute Caesar raises the knife to,0.50887436
kill and yet he can't do it just like this film source material dracula Caligari,0.6701414
falls in love with one of his victims and kidnaps her and again as they,0.43418816
leave you get this long shot signifying how there's nothing you can do to try,0.3110949
and help her her family rushes in they check the window and see Caesar taking,0.09874097
Jane away is such an incredible shot Caesar escapes James family catches up with her,0.18330656
and Caesar runs off into the however Caesars reign of terror ends after he falls,0.31089434
from a hill and dies he revealed that the Caesar that we had been seeing,0.34989452
earlier was one that Caligari kept was actually a dummy we find out Caligari is,0.3637473
really the real mastermind behind all this francis catches up with Caligari and he knows,0.14742406
that he's behind it they chase each other and Caligari runs into a mental asylum,0.6446913
this entire sequence is so well edited together going back and forth between caesar Caligari,0.03973252
and francis the police it is really great filming obviously the standards for good editing,0.3871594
and good filmmaking today have changed but this is one of the pioneers of innovative,0.05898949
editing instead of just seeing one clip we're seeing a collection of clips all happening,0.15212746
at the same time there used to build up suspense and tone and it is,0.053496692
so well executed to get such an incredible no next we see francis follow Caligari,0.22089225
to the asylum after he assumes Caligari may be a patient the hoard is revealed,0.14406644
that he's the director albeit this isn't the most shocking twist you're just introduced to,0.093694665
his Asylum minutes ago and yeah this is one of the earliest cases of a,0.119005635
plot twist this crazy old man may not be that crazy he may be the,0.76899767
director of a well established insane asylum the Francis tells the other hospital employees that,0.24067564
he found out in Caligari is now under supervision what I love about this film's,0.05693492
final act is that it isn't so much a horror movie but instead of detectives,0.1544991
go you finally learn about the real calendar this reveal is so great and you,0.10271607
get the first dynamic or moving shot in this entire movie you find out exactly,0.10689503
what happened the entire time there's also after the great social stadium you find out,0.05830489
why Caligari works in the sounds we find a victim to act as his personal,0.17673278
murder cool and whether or not the director intended it or not it ended up,0.3218309
being a great social statement because what we now know about asylum and abuse we,0.15692861
get a great transition that goes to a flashback so yes this makes a flashback,0.13601755
in a story that was told to Caligari discovering Caesar for the first time Caligari,0.053531706
begins extensive research before setting his monster out on the town and he begins to,0.2425702
go crazy he sees demands all over the screen again this is excellent editing this,0.37898284
is something that has never been done for in film and yet we're seeing a,0.036210075
combination of both what's happening in the real world but also special effects that happen,0.07954876
in post-production finally we go back to France is talking to the man from the,0.15825687
beginning however this film does not end on a positive note Jane is locked away,0.09611161
in the asylum with Caesar only Caesar is out of total personality chained no longer,0.3124862
is he a murdering psychopath but instead someone who's lost and confused playing with flowers,0.721936
in the asylum but then we get the best plot twist of all Francis might,0.11703978
be insane he's locked in the asylum just like everyone else and the film ends,0.40326205
on an ambiguous note so was the director of the asylum Caligari or did Francis,0.09315927
dream it all up we're never told it's only up to us to guess so,0.064773075
this is truly an excellent film is it a perfect movie well you could definitely,0.096161656
make an argument saying it is however undeniably this is a very innovative movie the,0.08529829
director uses color to show off time of day and similar locations which although it,0.037928075
wasn't the first time that this happened it did it in such a great way,0.09026801
the film utilized some great editing techniques some awesome dynamic shots and is all around,0.08592378
a truly excellent film it's one of my favorite horror films out there and definitely,0.10828226
one you should watch this time of year so if you've seen the cabinet of,0.06304754
dr. Caligari make sure you drop a comment and tell me what you think about,0.06938587
it do you love it do you hate it if you've never seen it before,0.31855416
and you did see it after this video tell me what you thought about it,0.061884183
I loved it for one I think it's truly one of the greatest works of,0.07371631
film that we have ever seen it's so well made so well directed so well,0.062450677
acted however not everyone feels that way so if you did enjoy this video drop,0.18637258
