Steadicam which i think is pretty interesting for a film shot in the 21st century,0.14555682
when there's so much big cinematic movement also to note the focal lengths all seem,0.029824173
very normal there wasn't anything extremely wide or extremely telephoto this gave the film a,0.024893833
really human feel now think about what this movie might have looked like if Michael,0.06382903

I'm done have fun with your cereal oh wait it's mine I'd pay for that,0.16949944
so with this shot I basically want to see how well I could replicate the,0.05075285
dynamic range basically had a few options blows off number one I could have raised,0.07161035
the ambient light in the room to match that of the outdoors with my prosumer,0.05218299
lights and the high ceilings this wasn't really an option a second I could have,0.024746163
decreased the life in the window I could have done this with sheets of nd,0.107187696
now I didn't have an in hand but we've used this in the past on,0.019239107
other productions and it's been pretty effective my guess on how big did this one,0.053404935
set was by pushing some extra light into the ceiling and then adding flags in,0.020006062
the foreground to keep the light off the actors my impromptu solution was cutting the,0.08160074
light slightly but the shears and then allowing the window to be overexposed by a,0.048966162
stop or two afterwards I realized I could have taken the exposure down on all,0.07981273
three shots because the foreground and the original scene is actually pretty dark second I,0.07889411
wanted to duplicate how a lot of the dialogue scenes were shot in this film,0.078166395
first a wide 50/50 and then two over the shoulder shots third was the color,0.09169224
grade here's the shot before new color grading first I took her still from the,0.13240081
movie scene and then I dropped into my timeline in the color panel I went,0.050156176
down to the color wheels and matched tab I clicked on comparison view and that's,0.027227297
at the comparison to the frame from the video I wanted to match next I,0.033338338
clicked apply match and waited for it to analyze make any adjustments you want from,0.034493763
there finally I jumped over to the effects window and edit effect noise at 3%,0.06235897
