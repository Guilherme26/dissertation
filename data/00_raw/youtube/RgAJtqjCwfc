hey how y'all know what this is this is Josh okay um right now I go to Alabama A&M I'm a grad student Alabama A&M and I had to go see summer for one of my own psychology classes so I thought you know what I watched it I'll make a review no post it and see what other people think and let you guys see what the booby is before you guys see the movie so I'm just going to read off my written review the movie Selma was placed in rural Alabama during the 1960s during this time black people in the south for fighting for their voting rights the legendary martin luther king jr. brilliantly played by david on Lulu came to settlement with his members of Southern Christian Leadership Conference to connect with the grassroot black activists already in summer to lead the nonviolent demonstrations throughout the city during these demonstrations director Ava de Luna was able to depict the several violent acts that were committed against the peaceful protesters by the city officials being you know the officers on the governor letting them do these things crazy the violence against the protesters recreated on film and connected the viewer to the struggles that the black people of the 1960s went through fighting for their voting rights it also showed how heartless the white people in the South once were screenwriter Paul web grabs the attention of the viewers by creating a personal dialogue between dr. King president LBJ at the time and his wife Coretta and also they show personal conversations with his group members of the sels see these conversations allow the viewers to see a different side of King allowing us to connect with King struggle and the movement do it all this was a great movie ok that's the written review now this is my personal opinion about the movie now Selma was a recreated event this happened you know in the ninth in around March bloody sunday was a March March something 1965 let's say in 1965 right now we're in 2015 this is almost 50 years ago that this event happened now um being a heartful film and being um actually produced by oprah his production company and i was thinking the other day like Harpo is crazy cousin color purple I think hella purple every time I think Harpo or I think of Oprah so harpal was I think Danny Glover played by danny glover and he was raping you know whoopee and stuff and I mean that's what I think besides that um the the creating budget for this film was 20 million dollars 20 million dollars so they so my personal opinion we use 20 million dollars which you know I see everything as a big community because I feel like that's what um that is what our people need we need to stick together you know and the thing to spend them really wrecking our communities is the whole divide and conquer mentality so we're out here separately it's not going to work so let's say 20 million dollars coming out of our community to create a Selma now a lot of us you know that um has some time on this earth has heard about about the civil rights movement you know and it's felt the struggle of the civil rights movement that is still a real struggle today you know some people that are in Alabama some people that are still in the rural South are still dealing with that same oppression because as we as we understand you know the United States history um these people came from Europe they came from Britain they came from Germany it can from italy they came here and oppressed the original native american that lived on this land push them into reservations massacre there there of their elders and their children this is what happened so that story has been told you know even though you know it's been told from there his story you know their personal accounts of what happened and um basically it was bloodshed you know and and that has been their history and their story ever since even leading up to this 1960s selma events called Bloody Sunday so the fact that we still put ourselves in situations like that um just regarding to the 1960s because as I watched the video you know even though you know um the devonian I think I'm murdering her name I don't want to murder her name but you know she was able to you know create scenes during in the movie that was that was very um heart heart wrenching you know it was tearjerkers cuz she she began the movie with the with the birmingham girls in the church being just blown up boo automatically took even though I wasn't even alive then you know I didn't even know about how about that i was even thought of but once i seen these girls get blown up on film it automatically took me there you know our man took me to to the place of of the harsh races prejudice South you know and but I mean it's not really surprising to me you know once I because I understand history this is the Europeans history you know everywhere they went it was terrorism it was it was bloodshed it was killing this is this is their history so I'm saying with with visa with these certain scenes that ava devine he was able to create Jesus brought me back I'm 20-24 so she just brought me back to that oppression you know she brought me back to you know filling um um empathy and sympathetic and just low and why me for these girls I mean even though these girls has went on to you know the Act life you know that the UM the forever the infinity you know they they are our essence is now because if they would have live did not have been bombed by you know other Christians it's ready cuz you got to understand um these people are people black people in America you know black is the label they put on us but I'm gonna go on you know for the sake of this review black people you know um that were put down in the church at that time was bombed by white Christians so there was black Christians in the church and there was white Christians outside of the church bombing the church building killing our little girls that's just fact that that's just this is what it was so you know it was it was cruel seeing it on the scene I mean seeing it on the screen but the scene was real it's what happened it was faction um other things you know the March dub the bloody sunday March seeing our people walk from Selma you know going to Montgomery after you know a heated um conversation with Martin Luther King and the recent president LBJ at that time um on the King big basically babe he said it within you know in an educated standpoint you know as depicted by Amy does devonian written by Paul web though this is all text written by Paul web you have to remember that Paul weapons your peanuts once you like to know that Google that so so we still have the European telling this story so you know he spoke to LBJ telling about the importance of us having voting rights all around the south because that was something we were deprived up we would deprive the Voting Rights so after that LBJ denied him said I got other things to do I got other things to do so they continued on the March so they can bring awareness and show what's going on to show that we need boating rights now so you know um passing a little talented the towns called Lions they didn't lock the black American the black citizens to pass through there they're counting these are real Christian folks to these are Christian folks then other Christian folks want you guys to understand that make sure that's clear so they didn't want the black people passing through their city you know they call them [ __ ] [ __ ] you know they want them passing through the city so you know what they did they barricaded the side of the city they barricaded the bridge and they got ready for war you know being mean the white people I speak about of lions i think it was Lions County they think they was on horseback policeman on horseback they had policeman with bats batons they had um one guy that they showed as he rolling up one of his bats with barbed wire I mean ready to commit violence and this crowd of black people were just marching peacefully marching peasley to Montgomery just to get voting rights I mean these rights are written in the Constitution they are mean if you understand the Constitution and read the bill of rights I mean we're giving inalienable rights means meaning you cannot lean on the natural rights of the man you cannot lean on our rights we have rights that are written and rights that are not read I mean they're given to us by our Creator so these rights are infinite so boating is definitely one of those so these people get beat I mean Bloody Bloody on the scene so it automatic scene is another scene that brought me back to that oppression I seen my grandmother my auntie my father my grandfather pause friend getting beat and talking about bloody dripping you know this takes me back to that moment so in me I don't know about all the other viewers out there but it definitely started building a turmoil in my body you know man these white people are evil that is why people are here the debtors that's what I seen on screen I mean they call it there the regarding to be like I'm channel um governor lee look at the governor lee of alabama at that time I mean um there was a scene where he sits down with LBJ and president lb taste like man you you see these civil rights movements you see these nonviolent demonstrations why don't you just give these [ __ ] um boating right just give the pony rides you know it's give it to him anyway in the Constitution why not you know and the governor is like man you you basically give these black people what they gonna want at all you give these [ __ ] one thing they're gonna launch something else you give them that they're gonna want something else that guy that governor Governor leave his descendants is still here controlling Alabama nothing is left those same people from Lyons County that that same bloodline that same group of people was raised and indoctrinated in the same ideologies are still living in Alabama now I can say this with confidence because I live in alabama now I've seen it personally on a personal account I've seen the oppression I've seen the prejudices I seen the segregations i I've seen the discrimination on so many different levels I see what the repercussions of Bloody Sunday has done to our people here in Alabama I've seen it people walk around docile with their heads down you know we don't you don't strive for anything you know on the account of you know the Eric garner being shot in New York on the count of Mike Brown being shot in st. Louis and I see our people still doing the same actions as they did then I'm bloody sunday waiting for the police to go horseback and knock them over waiting for the police to wrap their bats in barbed wire and hit they're just waiting to be a press waiting to be brutalized waiting to be harassed that is what we wait for we want the world to see us get beat why why why do we want to be in such a docile state do we not understand that that in the days of Kemet in the days of newbie in the days of the great cushion push em pyres in Ethiopia we were kings and warriors we were kings and warriors I was watching a Native American doctor documented me the other day it was on on him the aim Association when they were fighting for their rights and the Native Americans are fighting for their rights at a very similar time when you know the black America's fighting for their rights and when they was fighting for their rights they they got in touch with their spiritual self they got in touch with their ancestors they got in touch with the ancient rituals their people used to do back in the day when I seen you know Selma I'm good where we're focused on Selma now every time we had a conference every time we came together to talk about the events that were going on where we yet we're in the church who built the church the southern white man who taught you about Jesus Christ who taught you about the King James version of the Bible who taught you that it was the slave master it's written is written the slave masters talk to you about King James the slave masters talk to you about Christian be and where do we come together at when we want to talk about I guess I even joining the slave masters because right then we're pushing integration we wanted to go into their systems we wanted to vote for our own senators and governors but we have to realize that governmental system of democracy is their sister it is the slave master system so let's wait you're talking about fighting for boating what really confused me and had me perplexed over the the movie is out of everything we can fight for out of everything to fight for it with with promises the 40 acres of them and the meal I was even born then but this is what I see we had the 40 acres in a meal to fight for we had perfect sovereignty to fight for we had you know um take us back to Africa the great Marcus Garvey spoke about pan-africanism you know by moving back to the motherland they don't want us here apparently apparently when we watch it counts as as you know Selma Bloody Sunday we see the history of them not morning us here but yet we want to fight and integrate into their system the great Malcolm met the great teacher Malcolm X he spoke about this a lot why what why try to fight and n be brutalized because of us wanting to sit at their counters and eat or us wanting to go to the schools with their kids so they could teach us about Columbus Columbus founding you know America which we know is wrong when she know was not a relevant statement in the perspective of us being melon 80 people that have been on this this here land that they call America's since the beginning of time look up the Native Americans I want you guys to look up the Morse nation you know there were tribes here that were originally here way before the European came here that looked just like you would we fighting for rights in their system while we had our own system intact and in place on these lands here just look it up just look it up there's information on this so all i want to say through this video because i know i was on my soapbox all i want to say from this video when i watch summer i just feel like we're being stagnant we're just standing in one place is not moving for let's move forward this is the information age now then you can say during slavery even though that is a small span of time you know when we talk about you know being melon ated being African being black being whatever if you look like if you have skin of copper color or darker you are me you are my bloodline you are my bloodline which we have originated from kings and queens the originator of the earth just look at the information because there's information out here so as a community we could go past slavery I feel like us making movies as in Selma we're just reminding ourselves with oppression a small period of our life we've been around since the beginning of time let's tell that story we go past the caveman let's go past that story don't even don't even think paleo think the great Asiatics think the great um I could bulan this think the great cush I think the great to Don the people of a very very dark-skinned those people there's a lot of stories out here so you know us telling the story of selma and i want to say rest in peace all of the ancestors that sacrifice their life for settlement because that's what they seem fit at that time so i don't say anything is wrong i'm not saying anything is wrong with those actions that those people at that time took but this is our time now we have to walk through the doors that they open we have to live the dream of Martin Luther King reactor we have to actually put into action these things that our great ancestor sacrifice forward and create our own create our own stories instead of Selma let's talk about the great ancient commit cuz they're doing it then the Exodus I know you guys seen the exits we wouldn't want me going will say that for another review but the exit is there they're talking about it the Prince of Egypt there they're talking about it now when are we gonna talk about our story when were you going to talk about the great new be an empire when we gonna talk about the great a Marcus Garvey I haven't even seen a movie depicting that great man's act I happy so I believe you guys with that I want you guys to look up the Native Americans here though I wanted you guys to look up the more so I want you guys to look at the natural people the indigenous people of this land in all these lands because we are the originator of this earth so I'm gonna say peace love and baddest vibrations to you guys all right comment below if you guys have anything to say you guys have any comments or are some some response to me give me clarity put me in my place correct me if I'm wrong
