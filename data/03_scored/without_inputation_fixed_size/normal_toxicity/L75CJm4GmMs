you know I only got this jacket probably about a couple of months ago aberrantly,0.08138526
how much of an opportunity to wear during the summer even though it is pretty,0.04995334
lightweight the funny thing is that considering that's got a military s styling it's not,0.107394956
entirely accurate obviously but there were some patches on the shoulders most of which I've,0.07303048
taken off just weren't really my thing there wasn't actually American flag patches it's kind,0.16275118
of funny because I'm Canadian but I think it's about time that given this jacket,0.06341006
I might as well wear it during a movie review and actually talk about a,0.043843944
war movie for once hey there folks welcome to spectrum pulse we talk about music,0.15284465
movies art and culture and today in another unscripted movie review we're going to be,0.11671432
talking about the newest film from Christopher Nolan Dunkirk I think if you take a,0.06559905
look to a lot of guys especially guys my age in the 21st century and,0.11623206
ask them to name a filmmaker for which they admire and like most I bet,0.055422336
a lot of them would say Christopher Nolan and it's not entirely surprising as to,0.11021224
why if you take a look at a lot of films there's a certain hyper,0.0890414
masculine logic over a motion actually logic and structure and Duty over pretty much everything,0.0889185
that has run through a lot of films and for a lot of guys that's,0.14162251
a pretty powerful resonating force and if you want to all pretty much all of,0.12719622
its films like memento and insomnia and the prestige the Dark Knight trilogy Inception even,0.15102018
to some points interstellar although not really caused it to turn for an emotionality that,0.072778344
anything quite stuck the landing a lot of these films are based upon guys on,0.15026386
a mission or on some sort of deeply seated task and these are brought down,0.08895903
by their emotions or contradictions of duty or living forces of chaos and anarchy sometimes,0.12848626
you get that defined force I think one thing that I think Christopher Nolan does,0.0833478
not get enough credit for is a lot of the definitions of character that goes,0.0506837
into these stories the people who are actually facing the brunt of this chaos and,0.15381135
raw emotion ality for obstacles that that sort of brain cannot quite contextualize the things,0.33739007
that don't make sense and the fact that christopher nolan can so candidly construct these,0.10691748
characters even in broad archetypes that can be pretty powerful to tell these sorts of,0.062954016
very structured narratives and he'll probably in section is the biggest example when you have,0.11532311
all those interlocking layers of dreamscape nearly undone by that female presence in the mind,0.2295747
and yet walking out of it there is some still form that that was more,0.07483786
of an layer metaphor for filmmaking itself layer upon layer upon layer of production and,0.101166956
scripting so what happens when you get a film that's a little bit less about,0.1684638
that script a little bit less about that architecture and puzzle box around it but,0.08411837
least on the surface at least when it comes to the characters dialogue and more,0.043028537
about the concept of how the film is going to be structured and layered well,0.055196714
then you've got a film like Dunkirk and I will say this right out of,0.17456807
the gate the story of Dunkirk from a world war two narrative is not an,0.05816329
easy one to tell the Dunkirk evacuation Rutledge took place over a couple of weeks,0.0649279
of the coast of France coming in right after Germany has pretty much steamrolled through,0.10492961
the majority of Belgium and France and it's a losing battle it's an evacuation there,0.13081087
are hundreds of thousands of soldiers that are going to be quite literally driven into,0.0980113
the sea if they'll get destroyers or something that ferry them back across the channel,0.24590008
to get to back to Great Britain and there are not enough boats and the,0.115521185
big story here is getting those boats being able to fight off the Luftwaffe and,0.1125049
with enough air support and just getting those troops home getting them out of there,0.0707366
the problem with that is that telling that sort of story over a week-long expanse,0.07880866
of time that would probably be more suited to like an HBO miniseries it's the,0.062143505
sort of film that I think a lot of people would just say from a,0.075243585
structural vantage point would not really make sense here's where Christopher Nolan comes into play,0.069830626
here and the big twist to how this film is structured and I think a,0.08033966
lot of people have given him a lot of credit for it but I'm going,0.058980446
to dig into Weiss both a good idea and get a slightly hampering on the,0.152691
first story is set among a bunch of marooned soldiers who are desperate to get,0.36999148
off the mainland and that takes place over a week of time then you have,0.0742573
the story of a couple people on a boat a family who is basically going,0.086830325
out and making one last dish chance to go out and then rescue whatever troops,0.059026748
they can that story takes place over a day and you have a squadron of,0.14497767
three fighter pilots that are going out and making a last-ditch cover run to drive,0.10029656
off any dive bomber saying the Luftwaffe before any of those boats across the channel,0.20455603
will get a hit or sabotage that story takes place over an hour of time,0.24445646
and all these stories are nested inside each other the week-long story then you have,0.1143131
the day long story and then you have the hour long story here's the twist,0.073792376
all these stories have been sliced up and placed somatically across each other so the,0.0833515
time seems to jump piece by piece by piece until they all come into alignment,0.5007081
at the one point in the third act climax it's novel I'll give Christopher Nolan,0.098761
that in terms of structuring thematically it makes a lot of sense in terms of,0.088976555
structuring the narrative so that the tension is constantly maintained I think it's actually quite,0.1521193
ingenious in terms of being able so that each story has an effective arc and,0.033215515
arriving at the same rough point dramatically so that you don't have one arc that,0.07473591
is ended off before the other and then you get all your big actors having,0.3142523
enough screen time yeah that makes sense too I get why he did this here's,0.06903789
the thing when you realize that dick Euler structure comes into play once you wrap,0.8970467
your head around it you're then starting to see okay you're telling three arcs you,0.22971402
telling three pretty broad narratives in that broadness might work against the film's advantage because,0.07336648
and this is where it gets a little bit tricky because again this is where,0.1124503
I was asking and why was I struck before Christopher Nolan does have a skill,0.15951738
at emphasizing and developing up character and that doesn't really happen in this movie it,0.061894152
leans extremely heavily upon the actors playing these characters of the farce lines that they,0.12100213
have in order to flesh out some idea of that tension and hopelessness as they,0.2410128
feel remember they've got no backup coming they have lost this fight they need to,0.084012456
be able to go home and rally against and it that sense of hopelessness is,0.08621716
palpable the problem is is that when Christopher Nolan gives these characters so few lines,0.081040606
for all three main subsets of characters it can make things feel a little thin,0.076103345
a little bit too heavily reliant upon arc and relying on the actors to elevate,0.14543274
them and turn them into something more now don't get me wrong the actors really,0.22351433
put through the paces here particular mark Rylance as that riverboat captain in order to,0.09226198
haul people back T does amazing work basically trying to handle that stripped down straight,0.40320083
and proper common Englishman full that's able to make that one last-ditch effort really against,0.086602405
everybody's proper objectives including Killian Murphy who shows up as a shell-shocked soldier and really,0.3078303
kind of blew me away there just in terms of the subtlety of his performance,0.24264252
but then you also have characters like Kenneth Branagh who you would expect even a,0.08739071
much showy performance and he actually does its just really well in that particular role,0.051554505
as that to your master basically now having to stay behind in order to reconcile,0.16025655
with the Pythons effectively hopelessly at these people off and then you have the few,0.14291902
soldiers that are desperate enough and really they have names but you're not going to,0.1086843
remember them and the one I did recognize with Harry Styles and frankly he was,0.060792085
remarkably good in the terms of a role that ya requires him to emote and,0.059693802
pushes his character into some dark territory but at the same time like you and,0.14975017
recognise that if you didn't know for one and for another it's also a case,0.071435034
where I wish his intensity felt more grounded in something that could have been explored,0.09237035
a little bit more through dialogue through a lot of these scenes and through how,0.10611443
a lot of this movie's visual language came together and then you have Tom Harvey,0.07562526
basically acting as the courageous British Air pilot and you know what credit to him,0.059873205
for doing as much as he can where he's got a face mask over most,0.16101138
of his face and because that calls back a little bit to Mad Max fury,0.4916982
road there but at the same time you've got with Max Rockatansky emotion was coming,0.06251143
from a George Miller film whereas for Christopher Nolan by obscuring so much of his,0.07495396
face with kids happening in the characters with his particular territory and Christopher Nolan films,0.102900416
it actually kind of mutes a lot of our emotional response when you're relying on,0.096384786
him to carry an entire arc of part of that narrative especially when he's running,0.10126103
out of fuel he doesn't know how much fuel yet and he's pretty much doing,0.1634744
a one-man flight in order to blow away and you look WAPA bombers and fighters,0.4670059
and you know what I will give Christopher Nolan a lot of credit for how,0.08556031
he films a lot of this it's a pretty bleak war movie in terms of,0.11597032
the amount of water and oil and slick gray metal shifters toppling over and the,0.065649524
fire and again the water that explodes in and the amount of dirt and a,0.2718868
Haggard desperation that translates through a lot of visual languages of film even in some,0.06483762
of the big hero shots they do feel a little bit muted because again this,0.20820044
is desperation a lot of it is very much gray scented duty they're trying to,0.1077084
do what they can and the acknowledgement that most of them will not get out,0.077741705
of this alive you could say it's a very British aesthetic when it comes to,0.1541767
putting together a film like this and the fact of this movie is so intently,0.11510616
British and almost detached from presenting a lot of it I can imagine it will,0.069642805
resonate very strongly with that audience my problem is that for as cleanly shot for,0.15468124
as dramatic as this movie is trying to be foreign heavily as it relies on,0.14450668
a score from Hans Zimmer that constantly has that ticking as emphasizing the background in,0.07613956
order to intensify an update tension in fact about how much this movie relies on,0.10499997
that score with so much of the film is shot with vast empty stretches of,0.1539932
water and land Nord emphasize the smallness of these characters again Christopher Nolan's command of,0.079638794
the visual language is good but there's a couple inaccuracies that got a little bit,0.24408776
distracting not Elise being you do feel somewhat detached from these desperate characters these desperate,0.12861505
men when they're given so little dialogue and basically a lot of it falls into,0.2287329
well we have to follow orders we have to get out of this we have,0.068604425
to go home and it tries a little bit to intensify the moral drama and,0.15394221
add some shades of ambiguity but it's a little hard to suck me in when,0.8606264
you also have several competing narratives they're going directly full force with probably Tom Hardy's,0.06408322
being the simplest of all of them and while there is some degree of complexity,0.16402614
again it's not exactly as involving when the characters feel has been or as archetypal,0.066608675
as they are then you have the baffling twist to go for a pg-13 here's,0.085581735
the thing about Dunkirk and I get that this probably makes sense when it comes,0.07611039
to a Christopher Nolan movie and that he's trying to emphasize the mechanical stiff the,0.09526758
duty found and yet there's no blood at all it's actually sunny when you have,0.1425707
characters who died in this film who suffer some pretty traumatic head injuries who get,0.17527583
lit on fire and a lot of the injuries a lot of wounds a lot,0.19300734
of the trauma that would have occurred in this evacuation it's not even shown and,0.07041119
it does take you out of the movie a little bit when you realize that,0.183422
that does happen and it gets even more stark you don't see German fighters in,0.13940111
this movie and I get the reason why it was presented more as an impalpable,0.14889202
threat something that you know is there but you can't see because behind sniper fire,0.24720506
there's behind a war machine that is just not quite there in order to intensify,0.18144125
that tension the things that you don't see becomes all the scarier I get that,0.31089434
but it also becomes the point where you need to show something you need to,0.074286826
be able to pivot otherwise the tension just lies at a flat line and doesn't,0.16440105
escalate no matter how much sawing on the strings your orchestra does and again when,0.11545112
you have such archetypes they can work for fighting they are framed in a way,0.1519121
that allows you to empathize the characters allows you to get a little bit more,0.17362188
into what those characters are thinking allows show a little bit more subtlety and complexity,0.13801906
lean on that acting a little bit the problem is that Christopher Nolan is shooting,0.20419966
with big-ass IMAX cameras where Lanza shots will pan out to a wide shot and,0.7671679
you don't tend to get those levels of acting subtlety that will grab but otherwise,0.1504279
come through and yet I guess that it's a war movie and a lot of,0.15108898
these characters are designed to be archetypes but at the same time when you have,0.05680707
that there's still ways that you can emphasize the emotional drama in tension without just,0.09135283
relying so heavily on the fact that this is a thing that happened I am,0.051611625
showing it for you all taken and as you will and when the musical score,0.058817897
comes up be sad or be otherwise inspired I don't know guys like I want,0.12648585
to like this movie but there's a part of me that feels a little detached,0.10333513
from it and it relies like I said Christopher Nolan isn't relying on character in,0.061095312
the same way that he's in with Cobb and Inception where he did with Harvey,0.16435607
Dent coming out of the Dark Knight or I did it out from Gary Oldman's,0.07676245
characters in the entire Dark Knight trilogy like there was an point and I just,0.0749647
wasn't getting it in Dunkirk the same way I was trying like their characters that,0.061306093
do bear mount there but when you're looking for the thematic underpinning so much that,0.09225698
this is just more filmed as if it is a historical documentary event with a,0.060528275
neat framing structure tune or to intensify the drama I can almost see the gears,0.08215247
working overtime behind the screen in order to put things all together but when you,0.06406351
remove certain things from the human experience of what actually happened in that historical event,0.24154913
the mechanical construction of the whole thing becomes a lot more apparent and that's when,0.066675685
you go for the SATs soaring moments of human drama they just don't hit the,0.24048248
same way they could yeah the score is powerful but Hans Zimmer and some subtle,0.08357469
acting work from Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branagh can only do so much here look,0.09248955
I know I'm ragging on this movie probably more and I get why people love,0.1521304
it I totally do because it's not going to make a hollywood-esque story of a,0.080290094
war especially when a war scene that would not otherwise be covered by as mist,0.12124987
Oracle fiction it was an American focus like I totally get why this is a,0.095471874
passion project for Christopher Nolan and it's shot and constructed in a way that clearly,0.15561123
makes it seem like it was a passion project but it also feels like it's,0.086001284
trying to do three different things there's one interview that I read that says suggested,0.039488744
that Christopher Nolan wanted to make that a dialogue free movie and you know what,0.068888634
if he was going for that sort of bleak harsh tone poem approach when it,0.09268789
comes to that sort of war I might actually be able to appreciate it more,0.12261127
it would make a little bit more sense but the problem is when the dialogue,0.14963467
constructs so many of these characters as archetypes and yet we're still supposed to respond,0.06727696
and Cheer when you have big broad set pieces and get all the way further,0.2578201
while intensifying this scenes of desperation of war in which there's no blood I don't,0.10192769
know I wish I had more of a connection to it but all these elements,0.120302685
seem to be working somewhat at cross-purpose and I can see the mechanism behind it,0.083002605
so much more clearly and yeah that does kind of take you out of the,0.17059861
film now am I saying this is a bad movie of course not I think,0.17925967
a lot of the acting for what we get it is pretty impressive against Killian,0.17178588
Murphy mark Ryland Harry Styles probably has a career in more movies good for him,0.092869185
he seems like the legitimate triple-threat in that regard I'll give him plenty of points,0.2098041
for that and you know what as much as I kind of rag on Tom,0.28801093
Hardy for not being able to see a lot of this and see him emote,0.1459225
in the same way acting he still does do an impressive job being that stalwart,0.064465135
hero I'll give him points for that and you know what I will say the,0.07040099
film is shot beautifully it's clear that Christopher Nolan put a lot of effort and,0.12390022
do this staging and architecture of this film but when you see so much of,0.063677885
the architecture it doesn't suck me in the same way that inception did or the,0.7104261
Dark Knight did and I can be very blunt about that as such as much,0.14526191
as I like this movie I'm giving it a light seven out of ten and,0.10111997
I know that is harsh and I fully understand accept that but I wish I,0.12684591
was emotionally pulled by this movie more rather than just marveling at its construction it,0.07530527
has emotional pull to it but that's because just hold on for a second because,0.058379866
I've read this it's a John Keegan book about the second world war and it's,0.16016856
actually pretty alarmingly comprehensive and describing all these initiatives it honestly feels a little bit,0.10196417
like Christopher Nolan read this book or read any real study about what happened at,0.09114018
Dunkirk and tried to film it as much historical accuracy as possible except when it's,0.09833117
not nor to intensify tensions cousin via tease a filmmaker and you know what I,0.1056051
get filming a book I get making that sort of adaptation of real events but,0.078901835
for a story with so much potential to draw out that level of human drama,0.21238837
when in reality you have so many stoic stone-faced characters that are if even the,0.14942579
ones who are shell-shocked are barely emotive at all it's a little hard to get,0.14386538
invested in the story I wish I could more but at the end of the,0.038978655
day Dunkirk leaves me colder than it should it was good you'll probably enjoy it,0.31089434
but I'm not seeing the high praise that somebody else have given it that's just,0.068178914
it sorry so yeah thanks Laura for watching you like to like and subscribe I'd,0.07024454
be more than grateful I know this will probably annoy some of you again I'm,0.19021527
a bit of a historical movie so I again I get why Christopher Nolan made,0.068453625
this movie and I can tell that it was a passion project and I can,0.07644752
tell the amount of core to the story you can tell he feels a connection,0.0650855
to this work an emotive connection I just wish that beyond the construction and beyond,0.0925917
the obviously choreographed moments in order to trigger that connection that we got more of,0.119507305
it and that it was framed better in order to emphasize some of those moments,0.08374804
coming out of the acting which in the most part it doesn't quite do as,0.082134195
much as I would otherwise like I think it's a good movie again not a,0.08073827
great one but hey if you guys have any opinions beyond that happy here in,0.101256065
the comments if you guys want to get involved in my scheduling so I don't,0.08362447
cover this movie two weeks after its release link to my patreon right there where,0.048906446
three times a week you guys get to vote on my schedule and once a,0.10056147
week you guys need to add records or movies to my schedule or details right,0.05031091
there but till then I'm mark you're watching spectrum pulse and I'll see you next,0.14922541
