I'm just gonna let you know how I feel about this movie because I gotta let you know how I feel about this movie because oh my god this movie I freaking love this movie Oh Andre you love every movie that is not true,0.26087588
I do not think that all movies are fantastic but I do love this movie and I gotta say it's nice loving this movie knowing that I went in a little concern,0.10195932
I wasn't like worried but I was a little concerned because let's break it down,0.10979987
it's another spider-man movie how many of those have we had,0.13783126
it's an animated spider-man movie we've had animated spider-man TV shows and it's an animated spider-man film from Sony the company that gave us the emoji movie so needless to say had my concerns,0.16322489
and gonna be completely honest here first trailer,0.050406806
it was a different style of animation,0.09158108
and I was really trying to figure out what was going on with it,0.05368694
now seeing the final product,0.08071338
oh my god the animation in this movie it breaks all contradictions on 2d animation on 3d animation,0.1429234
it is without question,0.08083882
the true definition of a living comic book there are,0.09836613
so many things that happen when you're watching this movie that is just amazing in the sense of animation,0.103923865
I know I'm gonna use a word amazing a lot,0.0678696
and I'm sorry my spider-man but it's not a pun,0.14785317
it's just how I feel all the different ways that the colors are popping out all the different ways,0.179777
the characters move around when words pop up there's a couple of times watching this movie where I was like checking my glasses cuz I'm like am I in a 3d movie right now I feel like it because so many different layers and colors and things are popping out,0.07247371
so crazily that I thought I was in 3d,0.19337922
it's hard to describe it,0.08779507
you just have to see it it is beyond,0.122580506
anyone's belief of what they would have expected out of animation with this movie I am not kidding with you right,0.15342556
now on the animation alone this movie deserves a Best Animated Oscar nomination hands down,0.13941993
this movie gets snubbed like lego movie did for best animation Oscar nomination I'm gonna be a little upset,0.14868462
because this movie does something with animation that we have not seen in a feature-length animated film in quite some time,0.073152564
some of you didn't watch cartoons on TV may feel a little bit like okay,0.1470905
this is a big-budget version of some stuff I've seen on TV before but for most people this is gonna be like whoa,0.09556969
whoa are you trying to hate on Sony animators,0.40308952
but I feel like,0.03735638
the B team worked on the other movies they're like,0.06297102
oh you were real,0.11277503
good anime,0.08348192
uh yeah we're gonna mo G,0.07669461
ain't workin hotels resume,0.06538808
yeah you you you get over here resi,0.09679099
I'll go work on that Popeye movie that we're never gonna put out it is style and substance,0.13838011
this is the origin story of Miles Morales as spider-man it is so well done it was really cool,0.098951064
I mean we've got a lot of origin story movies about Peter Parker the movie itself even kind of jokes about that a little bit so it was nice to see how they did miles,0.08928956
the story who he is as a character how he has a different background how he is as a person how his family is you know all the different things about him,0.06917379
and what happens when he now has to take on the roles of being spider-man or learning how to become spider-man what's nice about,0.11700738
his character is that he's not just a great character,0.078766435
he's also a great avatar for us the audience what would we do in this situation how will we fill in the situation miles does that throughout the movie which is good because some crazy stuff happens in this movie I'm not gonna go too much into it because I don't know how many trailers you've seen but it is called spider-man into the spider verse so make your assumptions as you will,0.2783343
and I was worried that because of some of these outlandish things that happens in this movie could that take away from the mild storyline and what's nice about this movie is that it doesn't it always comes back to Myles,0.12258393
he is the the way to keep this craziness grounded and that's awesome,0.2940683
they did a really good job with that I'm glad that we were able to have some fun with this some craziness with this and yet still be a great story about Myles about his family about his becoming spider-man just all of it I almost don't want to hype up too much this movie because I know as much as I keep hyping this up you know you're gonna have that person to be like,0.26691094
I can't be that great and they're gonna go into the movie completely looking for nitpicks,0.1180284
so I'm sorry if I'm sounding a little bit overhyped but I can't stress enough how much I love this movie and it is a Spider Man movie so expect some spider-man references like a lot like a ton like on Lego Batman level of spider-man references characters meta humor,0.10546581
this movie is a love letter to the spider-man franchise and what's nice about it is if you're not well versed well spider versed in all of spider-man's lore,0.10954651
and I mean all of spider-man's Lord don't worry,0.25706816
it's still entertaining you're still gonna be like oh that's cute,0.15485588
that's funny that's neat,0.109343626
that's cool you're gonna still enjoy it,0.08480785
if you're with someone who really knows a lot about spider-man you will be like oh dad,0.22421537
they put that in home,0.07321965
I got some issues like you're gonna be like that,0.16553186
so that's really cool that it works on different layers and without saying too much because I don't know how many trailers people have seen you definitely get the variations of a character,0.043911483
and because you have variations on a character you get to play again with the animation with different styles,0.05412609
you get some 2d stuff,0.15029332
some 3d stuff,0.07606059
there are some times where it almost feels kind of stop-motion like anime inspired Looney Toon slash classic Saturday morning cartoon inspired like everything in some way gets represented both in spider-man and in animation that black panther soundtrack it's a great soundtrack but I'm telling you what spider-man in the spider verse was like hold on one second I would like to add a few more songs to your Spotify playlist if I may please and I'm talking about like some new school stuff some old school stuff some comedy stuff,0.21140248
I'm like alright when this track comes out I'm ready for it,0.08582164
oh but I'm trying it's a black Latino spider-man are they gonna really shove that down,0.71429294
my throat how do they handle the representation,0.23994388
you know how they show representation this movie they show it like it sits there like it exists kind of like how it exists in the real world like that's that's it,0.076178305
that's how it's done no big speeches,0.085075
you know no big like haha metaphor is just,0.19467272
he exists,0.071024366
he's a person that exists,0.13479902
I know it's shocking turns or issues,0.0969978
it is very fast-paced coming from a guy who talks really fast on the internet,0.19101189
it's very very fast-paced,0.07806478
if we prepare for that um if you had a problem with the screen Slayer seen in Incredibles - there might be a couple of times in this movie where you may want to just be careful with your,0.082202084
eyeballs I'm just gonna tell you it just as a,0.119994916
precaution I'm not trying to diagnose or,0.06643425
anything I'm pretty sure for most people gonna be,0.073163
fine I just want to put that out there because it is a movie that has a lot of colors a lot of things going on at one,0.07904844
time so for some people that might be just something to just at least know about just be aware,0.054877274
of and I just wanted more I just wanted more of it like I love this so much when it was all over I was like huh I want more of,0.051457874
