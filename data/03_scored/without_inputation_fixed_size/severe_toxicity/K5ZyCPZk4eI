yeah sorry man get out yo I really do not want to spoil this movie,0.09815516
i'ma try my best to not give away too much but y'all know I had,0.059904445
to do a review on this movie I went and saw get out which is,0.032180253
a movie written and directed by Jordan Peele and if you guys are familiar with,0.027682282
who he is he's an actor and comedian he's most known for his show key,0.037490416
and Peele which is like funny is oh now after seeing this movie twice I,0.055919327
saw once with a group of people and I went to see it again by,0.07783447
myself I just knew that I was gonna have to come on here and talk,0.045586366
to you guys about this movie when I first saw the preview of this movie,0.03561194
I was super skeptical one because I mean it was a black guy he loved,0.37758836
black people are in scary movies and definitely not the lead and when they are,0.5364356
you know they in like two seconds and I was also skeptical because it said,0.031962074
from the mind of Jordan Peele who's known for you know for comedy I saw,0.030897781
that cat movie and if I mean it was funny but it was just like,0.04088751
pure ridiculousness so I was really curious about how he was gonna jump from comedy,0.5025409
into into like suspense thriller horror and for anyone who knows me like I love,0.17991088
scary movies like horror thriller suspense is my favorite genre of movies so I didn't,0.02812729
really I didn't really see the connection between him and this genre movies but I,0.022827772
went to go and see it anyways I'm gonna start by saying that this movie,0.02787319
was both hilarious and terrifying and it was a hilarious in the sense that I,0.061729044
felt like I was watching a comedy there was just a bit more comic relief,0.065197974
than your average horror flick and it wasn't terrifying in that it was scary it,0.109319605
was just there were parts that make you jump and this movie just made you,0.038944505
feel so uneasy like I was in that theater stressed out like I was on,0.043795027
the edge of my seat the whole time this just the emotions this movie brought,0.047889233
out of me was just befuddling is funneling a word but fettle funnily whatever but,0.05320804
it is very clear that this movie is meant to be a thriller and not,0.038975105
a comedy and honestly how this movie got made and passed through Hollywood I have,0.032421052
no idea but I'm gonna break it down for you guys and tell you what,0.12527603
I liked about it and what I didn't like now the first thing that I,0.041055135
liked about the movie is that it opened up playing redbone by childish gambino like,0.050301854
I love that song but the reason why I feel like this is important isn't,0.016724713
just because like Oh much movie with song at like no there's a lot of,0.030876495
movies with music I like this song and this album in particular like it really,0.05312223
gives you the feel of blackness that sounds probably really weird for me to say,0.2604178
it sets the tone and it sets the vibe the only reason I'm saying this,0.061897334
is important is because the way he interacted with the other black Pete I'm try,0.16272187
not to give away too much but the way he interacted with the other black,0.3111464
people in the movie like it just gives you a certain feeling and when you,0.075713865
watch this movie you'll know what I mean I also liked the imagery the cinematography,0.11392068
it was very well shot the shot angles the color palettes was really really good,0.5121192
um the way it was filmed it was there was a lot of like symbolic,0.026006686
shots within the movie a lot of nods to like older horror flicks which I,0.20320429
thought was really really cool the performances were really really good especially Chris the main,0.031183144
character and his real name is Daniel a poop I don't know I'm sorry sorry,0.24923591
his performance was really really good like he really captured the feeling that I feel,0.033885784
like most people especially the black audiences I have to keep going back to black,0.49417242
people but me with this move you kind of have to but he really captured,0.0268222
the same feeling that we were feeling there were times in the movie where I,0.019559724
was like this is crazy I think he would literally be like this is crazy,0.17382778
you feel me so he really captured the feel of how I feel like most,0.03702811
people would react if they were in that situation the best thing about this movie,0.04300612
is the plot it is the writing like Jordan Peele nailed the out of this,0.080672145
movie like he did such a good job the way he wrote this in the,0.058210887
way he went about it was very very special like I'm gonna go I'm gonna,0.049379908
go into that a little bit later but the reason why I'm putting emphases on,0.15684365
the writing when you watch scary movies if you're someone who genuinely loves scary movies,0.042205237
you know that scary movies for the past like decade have been asked for the,0.040394608
most part that's partially because the writing is so trash they think if a nut,0.35076508
stuff pops out at you and there's enough creepy sounds and the actors can look,0.09732967
scared enough that it's a scary movie and a lot of people buy into that,0.06948043
that like Paranormal Activity cameras moving doors shut that is it's not scary the only,0.19619127
good scary movie I've seen recently that like automatically pops up off the top of,0.028513761
my head is insidious and ironically the producers from insidious were on this movie to,0.049045987
the fact that the plot was so enticing is what helps make a scary movie,0.024842614
scary or at least entertaining running away from the deal with a knife and door,0.104208335
shutting by itself is not scary the fact that you got comedians out here making,0.071078196
better scary movies than scary movie people yeah study game up now the next thing,0.03937355
that I absolutely loved was low-res character Laura as a comedian his name in the,0.026860116
movie was rot and what I loved about his character was he gave a voice,0.1901913
to every black person who's ever watched a scary movie literally everything he was saying,0.6298069
in the movie is what we say when we watch scary movies and it was,0.024837293
just refreshing to actually see a voice of reason in a scary movie scene on,0.058314655
scary movies everybody are like they're all idiots and it's probably why black people are,0.7917982
never in scary movies or they kill us in like the first two minutes because,0.2387099
we don't put ourselves in these situation we don't chase demons with video cameras if,0.06942522
we hear a creepy noise we don't investigate we don't buy dolls from the 1800s,0.027717538
we don't do that let's split a bullet and if we're running we don't fall,0.2260399
now what I didn't like about this movie was I honestly can't think of anything,0.05739005
I dislike about this movie I'm not saying it's the perfect film or whatever but,0.039545167
I really don't have any complaints like I think this movie was really well done,0.038547393
there are some things that were in the trailer and on the movie poster that,0.013905664
weren't in the actual movie or that didn't quite like connect in the trailer there,0.014014754
was like this deer skeleton thing like 1 rawr or whatever and you didn't see,0.031188466
that in the movie also on the movie poster there's like a guy in like,0.0431498
an old Knights helmet and there's a point in the movie where you see that,0.015649775
same helmet inside of the car it didn't really make that much sense but at,0.016535135
the same time it wasn't relevant enough that it leaves you really baffled or confused,0.017750425
if you don't understand this movie is not going to be because of that one,0.041240055
3 second clip in the trailer or that quick glance at that little Knight thinking,0.06380641
so it's not like a huge deal but you really don't want to see stuff,0.048852418
in the trailer that's not actually in the movie itself now something I find very,0.017159743
annoying and it isn't even with the movie itself is with the people who like,0.07756174
review this movie or review the trailer or just making commentary about it saying that,0.019155294
this movie is race baiting and all that other stuff and it's racist and it's,0.3378735
just there's a difference between race baiting and calling out racism like that those two,0.20125996
things are not synonymous like if you need clarification this movie was a psychological thriller,0.042088166
that used horror and suspense to point out how racism still exists in a society,0.19894245
that people are claiming as post-racial part of this movies intent was to show passive,0.18698512
racism as opposed to blatant racism a lot of us who are sitting here saying,0.19271168
that racism still exists and you guys are arguing it with us because the KKK,0.14920402
isn't ever I mean they are around but because people aren't getting lynched they aren't,0.15248737
getting which and this is why I think what he did was very unique and,0.024070336
special because the way Jordan Peele chose to point out racism was very clever and,0.18359402
it wasn't clever in a way that he was trying to be sneaky about it,0.085906476
he chose to point out passive racism as opposed to blatant racism because when we,0.13002478
see movies nowadays where racism is involved it's very Leyton it's very in-your-face and that's,0.1389675
because in most cases movies with black people in it especially what a black lead,0.33366278
is about slavery or it's about the civil rights era it's black people trying to,0.42071947
overcome some huge thing because of their blackness even though that still exists that's not,0.2219312
our everyday blame racism for the most part is not our everyday we deal with,0.12821747
a lot of passive races of a lot of under-the-table systematic very coded language that's,0.08944924
the type of racism we deal with on a day-to-day unless biro most of us,0.30041242
would be a little taken aback as someone randomly on the street jumped into our,0.06276407
face and caught us a like twenty thirty years ago that was the norm and,0.017810293
back then black people most of them wouldn't even think of reacting to the way,0.61396503
that we react to blatant racism now and what was so clever and accurate about,0.15147296
it is the way that he wrote the white characters and let's be real if,0.07003652
you watch King pill they know how to write like people but he didn't write,0.06574874
them as blatant racist like you know before I'm not even gonna get into the,0.4320823
plot twist they weren't malicious they didn't like imply black people were inferior to white,0.6174888
people they weren't saying I don't want this black guy in my house or dating,0.46492597
my daughter if anything they were just really ignorant you know they kept saying that,0.2582664
black people have special capabilities and their genetic makeup makes them better at this and,0.42983872
that they were just saying a lot of ignorant they were doing what a lot,0.27173817
of white people do to black people they always try to connect with us on,0.38749364
a black level before they try to connect with us as just regular human beings,0.49849045
and sometimes it just goes too far and so that's why a lot of people,0.041715663
get so sensitive when we talk about racism because they think we're automatically calling them,0.09957733
a KKK member or Hitler or think that they're trying to exterminate the black population,0.6843388
like no you're you're just a little ignorant like that it's all we're saying just,0.3283762
pull it back a little bit so when we say this movie is about race,0.120553896
and racism is not about it in the same way that we're used to seeing,0.10625777
it on TV and in movies there's certain things that were set in a moving,0.03446649
you're just like like aha like I don't want to give too much away but,0.13341323
there's like a point where he says it's a privilege to be able to experience,0.041132297
another person's culture when ironically okay I don't want to spoil it I don't wanna,0.07047222
give nothing wait there's another part where there's a party full of white people and,0.34238872
the white guy says to Chris black isn't style you know what I'm saying he's,0.32763085
like black is what's poppin right now that's not what he said but he said,0.17711246
black is him style attack at the extra puppet um there's another point in the,0.46391308
movie where Chris the main guy the black guy says why black people in the,0.36859733
guy responds it's a white guy and he's blind so I mean he doesn't know,0.351092
Chris is black unless someone tells him he's black so it's not like Pele was,0.43454713
trying to portray white people as the white devil who are trying to single out,0.53267235
black people I mean in a sense they were but again plot twist but anyway,0.4965025
to wrap this up I really really enjoyed this movie I honestly might do a,0.049320042
second video to kind of explain the actual movie because this movie was super intricate,0.07954399
there were so many layers to it and when reading comments and speaking to people,0.02053821
about it there was a lot of stuff that they didn't understand a lot of,0.027921084
metaphors they didn't understand that like really popped out to me so I kind of,0.038097728
want to like open up the discussion to talk about it um but that'll be,0.016916286
for a later time but I'm just gonna say I genuinely enjoyed this movie I,0.033785343
would encourage everyone to go and watch it and I would rate this I never,0.045179937
know if it's supposed to be rating out of five or out of ten well,0.046709195
