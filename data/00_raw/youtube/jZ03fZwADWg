all right the favorite not my favorite hey what's up guys my name is Steph Koza and today I am reviewing the favorite so the favor destructed by Y Argo slant the most I could 100% be pronouncing that incorrectly but he did the killing of a sacred deer the lobster dog tooth and he's like a pretty well respected director like he's done some good stuff this movie also stars Olivia Colman I'm a stone Rachel Weisz and if you watch the trailer you will 100% realize that this is Oscar bait to the nines like 100 percent Oscar bait movie it's set in early eighteenth-century England till about the Queen and her slaves and rich white people and Parliament Parliament Parliament so you know Oscar bait no I have no problem with that I enjoy oscar movies obviously they win awards for reasons but there are often times some of them to come out and you're just like this was just created for the Academy and nobody else but basically it's about the Queen of England who has this very close friend Lady Sarah and she kind of runs things for the Queen the Queen is just sort of like a figure and her friend Sarah basically governs the country in her stead then Emma stones character Abigail comes into the picture as a servant and the Queen begins to really like her and Abigail kind of tries to win her over so it's Abigail and Lady Sarah kind of competing to be the favorite of the Queen and like it's interesting there are some great scenes there are some really great moments some really funny moments this movie was surprisingly funny and Emma Stone is of course wonderful and completely blew me away and I would not be surprised if she got an award for this movie Sam goes for Rachel Weisz who plays Lady Sarah she was fantastic and Olivia Colman who was the queen and 100% stole the show like she just embodied that like kind of disgusting sort of stupid queen figurehead who doesn't really do anything and just like eats all day long she was very complex very interesting to watch and I I did enjoyed that part like the characters I enjoyed I loved watching them interact with each other they had a lot of very interesting unique scenes but I did not really like this movie you take out a couple of the good moments and like yeah I had fun watching those but as a whole I did not like this movie it was very very long or at least it felt super long it was also very boring like in between those good moments were huge stretches of just like really boring talk about the English government and like literally just Parliament Parliament Parliament this part of it that I was like I don't care about what you're saying it's so boring also I know I just said I liked all of the characters but I'm gonna take that back I enjoyed the complexity of the characters I did not like the characters like when I watch a movie this could just be a personal preference but I like to have a character to like root for like I want to be on someone's side I want to like cheer someone on like that's what I want to do when I watch a movie I need someone to lead the way for me this movie is just a movie about terrible disgusting people and you like think you like one of them and then I'll turn around and do something ridiculous and I'm like what is wrong with you I don't want to watch this movie anymore it's just a bunch of and I get it like okay it has a lot of merit and like as a film critic it's beautifully shot and the music is lovely and the acting is great but it's just boring it didn't enjoy this movie it didn't make any sense I have no idea what the purpose of this film was other than to be like look at these really rich annoying fat white people I think the cinematography was a little bit pretentious it was like also kind of weird there's a lot of like fisheye wide-angle like really distorted wide-angle lenses and I know it's like they're trying to make these like people feel very alone in this huge mansion and like I get it it's all about like isolation and I get the metaphor but it just looked like a sum 41 music video from like 1993 and I was not about it just a very disorienting upsetting film and I don't ever want to watch it again it was also one of those movies where it's like yeah no wonder everyone hates white people do you see everyone in this movie sucks they're all a bunch of but one tell that really gives away the fact that I did not enjoy this movie is when it ended first of all it ends very like abruptly and very weirdly like the whole movie up until the end is like you could follow it like it's fine it's a movie and then there's just like this weird weird scene and I don't it was supposed to mean something I'm sure if I like sat down and like truly analyzed it maybe I would figure it out but like I don't want to because I don't care but it was just very weird and then it just ends and I was just sitting there looking up at the screen I was just like what just verbally just screaming at the screen what and I'm not alone because there were a lot of people in my theater and every single one of them also said what they were all just like what what what what what what just what just happened do you know is anybody know what just happened sometimes movies like that are fun this time it wasn't because I didn't really care sorry there's someone in my roof blowing leaves and a whole bunch of leaves just fell in front of my window and I got really scared we didn't know what it was that's a fun sound okay I'm just gonna try and wrap up this video before all these weird sounds keep happening again uh yeah the favorite not my favorite if you liked it that's fine let me know in the comments why you liked it I would love to hear your wonderful analysis of this great movie and I'm sure it's gonna win a whole bunch of awards like the costume design was beautiful the music was beautiful the acting was wonderful like everything was great also definitely just kind of like 100 percent forget this movie even exists in like a month from now and not even recall what it is it's one of those movies so yeah I'm gonna give the favorite a 2 out of 5 Lincoln had good stuff in it it just wasn't good I didn't like it I'm sorry not a fan so there you have it there's my review of the favorite thanks for watching this video seriously let me know if you like this I really would love to hear someone defend this movie and like tell me why it's good because clearly people think it's good and it's been nominated for a lot of things I just don't ever want to watch it again that's it for this video thank you guys so much for watching I'm stuffed Koza and I will see you in my next video bye
