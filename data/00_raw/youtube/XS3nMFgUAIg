[Music] so for the july 2019 great film throwback day we are finally gonna talk about the film that when i did my little series of which movies i was gonna actually see in 2019 as part of this little segment on my channel we're gonna finally discuss the one that a lot of people were very very positive about and that is the Joseph mankiewicz film from 1950 also the Best Picture winner of 1950 All About Eve starring the greats Betty Davis and Baxter and Marilyn Monroe so I really didn't know what this movie was about but it definitely was a movie that I had always heard of anything by name and the fact that it also starred the great Betty Davis but one of the few things that I always thought about in regards to this film was the fact that Betty Davis was the character of Eve and to my surprise she wasn't she was a character named Margo Channing and Eve was played by Anne Baxter so that was definitely an interesting twist for me also knowing that this was directed by Joseph mankiewicz and last year reviewing his film Cleopatra I definitely was very curious as to how I was going to feel when I watched this movie so this is the story of a young woman named Eve this simple woman who is just head over heels over this Broadway actress named Margo Channing and all she wants is to meet her and possibly be a part of her life and after getting an opportunity thanks to the writer of a lot of plays that Margo was a part of his wife Karen played by Celeste Holm Margo really takes a liking to Eve and asks her to be one of her personal assistants and as time moves on it turns out that this innocent hopeful woman with big dreams in her eyes was not the woman as she claimed to Margeaux already had her suspicions about Eve pretty much from the get-go when after a few weeks had passed and she realizes that while she may be idolizing her she may be a little bit more towards obsession but it turns out that Eve has not only powerful feelings towards Margo in terms of her star power she actually wants to use this aging Broadway star to bring her own personal career to new heights and in the world of theater one of the ways to do so is to step on as many toes as you can and play people to actually make sure that you get to where you want you literally have to act offstage as well as on stage and through this process who of course gets involved well the journalists get involved particularly a man named Addison DeWitt who is probably known for digging up the most dirt on celebrities as he possibly can and what he discovers who this Eve is and what she's all about he takes her under his personal wing and through that Eve truly feels that she's gonna get even bigger and better and finally surpass Margo as the new fresh face of Broadway until she realizes that even she with the ambitions that she has can be played as well I will say with no expectations about this film whatsoever this was one of the most interesting and powerful and overall excitingly dramatic films that I have seen in a long while especially through the Golden Age of Hollywood this movie with the accolades that it received at the Oscars as well as being known as one of the greatest films of all time I see it it is one of the most powerful and beautifully acted films that I have ever seen I loved all of the acting in this film I was so entranced by this story even with a movie over two hours long the hours just flew by while I was watching it one of the other things that I really appreciate about this film is especially when you take a look at today's world in film how the leftist loonies are constantly yelling about the fact that women don't have powerful representation in films did you not see All About Eve because the male characters in this film are barely significant compared to the powerhouses that the female actors are in this film we got an baxter and betty davis in their primes and they gave us oscar-worthy performances for which they did in fact win the last home playing Karen Richards also playing such an incredible performance as the writers wife as well as Marilyn Monroe who has such a small role in this movie with her being on screen every minute she just shines throws out great lines and even though she's only in the film I think for a general amount of maybe five minutes she makes her landmark in this movie as a whole is regards to one of her better performances and I love that but without a doubt the dynamic characters the ever-changing layers of each of them is just absolutely incredible I mean Betty Davis is one of the legends her famous line fasten your seat belts it's going to be a bumpy night speaks volumes in regards to what this movie is about and Baxter as Eve is such an incredible character and it's not just the character evolving in the story but it's the way that she looks at the camera looks at the characters the way she looks like an innocent person in the beginning to an evil diva at the end is just absolutely incredible I think that that was one of the most amazing and worthy performances that I have ever seen from any actor it just gave me goosebumps while I watched her change on screen and I just loved how at the end of the day with this character being who she was the fact that what happens to her and the end is something audience wanted to see happen because you would think that Betty Davis was going to be the real crazed diva of the film but it's incredible how she ended up being the victim at the end of the day to a degree because of Eve's intentions I can't recommend this movie enough even if you have never seen a black-and-white movie before even if you're not interested in any movies that were made before 1980 I still cannot praise all about Eve enough this is one of the best films that I have ever seen in my life it is a movie that I would gladly see again and yes it's even a movie that I would consider getting on DVD but I haven't reached that conclusion just yet but it is definitely what everyone says it's supposed to be it is such an incredible film for what it is for its time and it definitely pushed so many boundaries in terms of roles for women I cannot praise all about Eve enough which is why I will be giving it a very strong three and a half stars out of four so thank you very much for watching everybody please leave your comments in the box below
