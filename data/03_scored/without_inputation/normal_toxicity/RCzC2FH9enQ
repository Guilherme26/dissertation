quite depressing at times just realizing what all these people might have gone through as,0.2480697
a result of the war for me this film had a profound impact it showed,0.1379639
very clearly the destruction that wars can cause us not just physically to the buildings,0.09967301

subtle anti-war film the script is excellent it really is not a predictable story i,0.08126353

all the unusual angles that the director used it highlighted the sinister atmosphere the actual,0.10097084
menace that you felt the uncertainty the danger the acting also was top notch and,0.12524806
of course special mention has to go to orson welles who is hardly on screen,0.0829023
and yet dominates the entire film he really does he's just so good in this,0.14889762
that it's worth watching just for awesome wells but that is not to take away,0.06527139
from the rest of the cast the vulnerability of harry lime's lover or the innocence,0.11245532

i love the cinematography the atmosphere i love the acting there is no criticisms i,0.07877251
have to make of this film i highly recommend the third man for anyone who,0.24145228
