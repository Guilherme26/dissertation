you would think that after three versions,0.12962916
three high-profile versions of this exact same story,0.061446365
well actually Bradley Cooper has made a significant change which we'll discuss in just a moment,0.051901214
but anyway you would think at this point there wouldn't be any magic left in this story but you would be wrong and what makes this version of a stars born truly shine is the following first off a movie star truly is being born here with Lady gaga,0.18377292
you know Bradley Cooper kind of short changes are within the movie but I think he makes up for it by giving her you know like setting her on her way as a movie star right,0.13262032
if you I mean the movie focuses more on Bradley Cooper which might disappoint some Lady Gaga fans but little monsters if you've come to worship at the altar of Gaga,0.59400594
don't worry you'll get in a lot of praying you'll have you'll have your religious experience watching this movie then ask for Cooper he's definitely given himself the role of his career the sound design is really really good,0.110965654
I mean I know it's a movie about the music industry,0.064728245
but I didn't expect the sound to be that good very very good make sure you buy tickets for a theater,0.053954326
that has a very good sound system the press screening was anna dolby atmos made a difference that also finally it's a sophisticated realistic depiction shockingly realistic and sophisticated actually of what it means to be a successful artist particularly in the music business,0.05001256
today now speaking of Cooper what did he do,0.05122375
what did he do,0.05734562
well as the director co-writer and one of the film's producers for the first time ever in this story,0.03522036
the older male role is made to be extremely sympathetic in the past,0.0801304
he's been under the character's unsympathetic villified almost even and is really horrible in his treatment of the young female ingenue right,0.31089434
and also in the past his character who's been a husband you know his career is really on the rocks but here Bradley Cooper's career is actually in pretty good shape and he things never really get that bad to be honest with you,0.110261165
and so the reason I'm bringing this up at the front of the review is that it makes a huge difference,0.037049614
in the movie and the movie as I said actually leans more towards Cooper than it does Gaga when in the past the female character has really been the focus and also even more so because this is still a very sad story bring tissues someone asked me,0.08808201
how many tissue,0.10649658
should I bring the whole box but so well you might also get a little bit annoyed,0.18505052
particularly if you're a Gaga fan but between the two people someone's got to look worse than the other one,0.19041626
and since Cooper is practically playing a Christ figure Gaga comes off as John grateful and uncaring especially in the third act,0.086157046
I actually thought uncharacteristically so for how kind her character was in the beginning in the moment,0.073779695
so yeah basically what you have here is that Bradley Cooper and taken no chances that someone else is gonna win an Oscar for his movie,0.10846343
okay he is definitely stacked,0.3580429
the dick I also have to say that the movie is way too long,0.8785311
and the problem there is that it feels too long right and it could easily lose half an hour easily lose half an hour,0.06051966
but thankfully there are such brilliant moments throughout like breadcrumbs right combined with powerhouse performances you're still kept engaged in the core of the film naturally is Cooper and Gaga's relationship which seems so deep,0.05684384
and so real that it's a credit to both actors,0.08466059
and also Cooper's directing of the scenes,0.05667252
it's really good stuff,0.06863987
now Cooper is doing a mean Sam Elliott impression and Sam Elliott by the way is in the movie playing his brother and there's even a commentary,0.07077912
on the fact that Bradley Cooper's doing a Sam Elliott impression,0.06640578
yeah Cooper brings vulnerability and kindness to the role,0.10217866
and he ultimately moves it beyond just being a Sam Elliott impression and he breaks your heart again unless you're Lady Gaga fan and you're like want you to go Gaga but he his character,0.097466454
I thought was just so charming but also speaking of breaking your heart he also delivers an incredibly convincing and realistic portrayal of an addict not just the behavior but the motivations to do such things,0.15791667
and also the repercussions of the whole situation really interesting then with gaga all right,0.16129899
so she starts out on her only false note,0.2813979
in the movie and I feel of Cooper was a little more protective of her he would have you would have changed the scene and it's a short scene clearly written by a group of men three men wrote this screenplay for a woman because any woman will tell you that we don't go into the ladies room and scream amen we just don't do it,0.17892896
we might be thinking it sometimes we don't really verbalize it like that it just rang false but for the rest of the film she is luminous,0.12854889
and you know what I enjoyed the most about her performance not the singing watching her character think that was really cool particularly in the early stages of her relationship with Cooper,0.09658126
when I guess the focus was a little bit more on her to some degree but she was trying to figure out the enigmatic celebrity sitting across from her,0.12701795
why is he talking to me,0.07927146
what does he want right,0.070563585
we'll talk about that at the end,0.054301232
but then also the added layer of difficulty that she's dealing with somebody who's drunk you know,0.32332548
and also not only that that's tough to do,0.07370941
but how she feels about it,0.08265617
you know that's a that's a lot to take on,0.06972504
and it's a risky road to go down but I think to her character's credit she goes down it with her eyes wide open,0.13374086
so I thought that was all great and that all came from Lady Gaga's performance also I have to add when her character starts to mimic Gaga's actual music career and those of her peers in the music business you know in this I'd say maybe the second half of the movie right you can tell that the commentary which is not flattering uh-huh skirts a little too close to home for gaga,0.09993261
and I think she's made a little uncomfortable by being asked to to be the face of that commentary right,0.24037422
and I think she isn't quite sure how to play it either which makes the second half of the movie not not as strong for her as the first that is for the music,0.08342581
I'm not a big music person but I will say that I was impressed because you know get a more into story and and movie movie making and stuff like that,0.09656575
so impressed me the most music wise was Cooper's ability to capture the feeling of being in a concert right both in the audience and also backstage and not just backstage from having VIP access that was done very well you were like oh let's go this is gonna be,0.080566704
so great like when she goes to his first concert he invites her there's like almost like a Cinderella type feel to it,0.10436784
it was really really cool,0.053970553
and then after that sound design as I said the press screening was an Adobe Atmos theater,0.051988382
and for some moments my seat actually throbbed from the music it was really cool,0.09192414
you felt like you not only were at a concert but you had want the best seat in the house as for the actual singing though I like shallow quite a bit,0.1954457
I don't see how anyone could not like shallow,0.11522634
it's a very good song,0.061967213
and also Gaga's chabuk charming performance at the drag bar,0.07361896
and also the scene that follows that backstage between her and Cooper that kind of like makes for a great package,0.079444826
but otherwise I thought the music wasn't particularly distinct,0.06714169
it's not like greatest showmen like for me at least I wouldn't I wasn't like I must buy the soundtrack,0.18850273
I was like I'm are they,0.050032515
so I mean,0.090360545
they also don't seem particularly original you know so you're like is,0.15274847
this,0.05212481
like a song,0.07763224
someone else's song,0.064875826
I don't know uh although there's also I have to say one song that she sings that's supposed to be bad and oh boy is it a stinker it was awful and like and I think that's part of why she was like uh you know I have to see these people in the music business Bradley,0.5574789
when I go back you know I'm still kind of in both I have a foot in both places so they're gonna be like with the creature,0.18706547
you saying something about me,0.09554605
when you did that performance right like,0.08639107
I don't know it was it was awkward okay but I have to say also as impressive as Cooper's acting is I dare say his directing is even more impressive he not only does the story justice but it's able to package it in a way that indeed elevates it to awards caliber material,0.07169627
I mean oh I've always said to you that you know directors they have a responsibility to present something as awards worthy like,0.106955014
this is special pay attention,0.09196808
this is a film for the ages,0.068851314
and I think Cooper very much does that maybe,0.06582006
that's why you made it too long,0.07743666
I think someone should have been like perfect,0.1055934
it's a real challenge though at the awards situation though because this is the fourth telling of the story and the three previous ones were all major awards contenders but despite a slew of nominations,0.05168835
no version is ever won a major Oscar one of the major categories,0.07797536
I think the highest has ever gone is screenplay,0.07707417
and while I feel that shallow is a shoo-in for Best Original Song,0.165534
I'll certainly be nominated so Gaga and Perkin sing at the Oscars right,0.08216636
but I'm curious to see if Cooper's version can go beyond nominations and finally bring home some gold in a meaningful way,0.040237527
it's certainly his intention to either get director or actor right,0.109163366
now though I don't think think we have a good enough feel for the playing field,0.0534224
so we'll have to wait and see how it shapes up finally,0.047351975
and I this is this is tough but it was struck me so much while watching the movie I wanted to discuss it here,0.11907136
I have I have to comment on the me2 aspect to the film which haha which highlights,0.06948718
why the me2 movement has sent the entertainment business particularly hard,0.10757816
and that's because there's often absolutely no line between professional and personal and it's a bit uncomfortable especially because of what's what's being discussed and what's happening today right to watch their first night together as under the circumstances a very different movie could easily have her claim years later that she wasn't willing to sleep with him,0.062799744
he wouldn't have helped her career,0.08878581
and that's the case,0.057567008
that's clearly the case that would be a correct accusation in this situation and I'm not saying the Cooper's character is vilified here by any means that just happens to be his motivation,0.045814317
if he didn't think she was hot,0.4032473
he would not have helped her if he wasn't interested in her physically you know,0.26073596
and you know it turns out here,0.10966011
fortunately there was a romantic aspect to it as well but there often isn't right,0.09663568
but I think because of that the scene actually does an amazing job of showing how grey perhaps too gray the entertainment entertainment business is instead of black and white when it comes to professional versus personal,0.15130363
it's like I would say that this is like again has a Cinderella type quality to it points,0.08908607
but like 99% of the time it doesn't turn out like this,0.07917578
so I would I would hate to think that this would kind of romanticize something that it should not,0.13227345
so just make sure that you know just like Lady Gaga's character goes into the relationship with her eyes open,0.09707688
you know make sure that you're really aware of what's going on in someone's intentions,0.11064394
it's it's complicated,0.09825549
but that's good I think I think the movie is it's complex,0.06878207
but I think there might have to be some commentary on that,0.051607985
and if there's if there's anything that could potentially undercut this for award season,0.05336269
it might be that the potential romanticizing of that aspect,0.09974223
but anyway that's my review of a star is born,0.069448754
I'm very curious to hear your thoughts down,0.1607721
below save those spoiler comments though for the spoiler review you know those are for those who aren't familiar with the star is born' story,0.055403173
you don't want to ruin it for them right,0.3093719
and then of course as always you can check out some more videos,0.09545082
