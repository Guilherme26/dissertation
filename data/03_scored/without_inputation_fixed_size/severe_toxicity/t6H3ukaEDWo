hey everybody today I'm going to be reviewing Mad Max fury road and I know,0.1277259
I'm so late hun reviewing this I know everyone's already seen it but I kept,0.020597411
getting request after request after request to review this movie so here I am I'm,0.019619592
devoted one of the reasons it took me so long to actually go see the,0.03326384
movies because I was a complete Mad Max virgin I we hadn't even made it,0.37929812
to first base I knew nothing about Mad Max I didn't even know Mel Gibson,0.06095144
was in it and I know that's kind of lame to admit but I just,0.15436384
I didn't really grow up with a lot of cult action movies as a kid,0.034455184
so I just never got introduced to it and you know what's so great about,0.03871635
this movie is that you don't have to have much backstory at all if any,0.05062513
to enjoy it and I think a lot of that comes from the simplicity of,0.026111783
the storyline the movie is just kind of one big climax that is stripped to,0.024720885
the bare-bones in terms of the plot you've got your protagonist which is max obviously,0.053762138
and he is a prisoner that is escaping from this tyrannical civilization that it's kind,0.2463425
of like a cross between Tatooine and Geonosis he is escaped and he is helped,0.023349276
by a woman named furiosa played by Charlize Theron and the whole movie is basically,0.03653255
just them trying to survive and they're being chased that's it some may say that,0.019559724
the plot is too simplistic and I couldn't disagree more I actually think ironically it's,0.043489706
very refreshing to see a movie an action movie know exactly what it is and,0.029707102
so it just keeps everything to the minimum in terms of how complicated the plot,0.022211812
is because I feel like nowadays all I see and I'm getting so sick of,0.03649929
it are these overly complicated plots and these movies these action movies that have so,0.03611282
much CGI no personality at all they're just like these cold corporate things that are,0.065384895
just kind of shoved out on an assembly line and this movie basically just Christ,0.0714201
Faolain all that Mad Max is a no-holds-barred blockbuster flick and it's gritty it's relentless,0.19320925
it's bombastic and all of this in the best possible way and it's one of,0.038431652
the best action movies I've seen a long long time I watched some of the,0.01757149
making of behind the scenes footage and from what I understand there's very little CGI,0.044514753
going on here and that is so great because to me you just can't I,0.06619309
mean at least right now I mean maybe in the future we will be able,0.024509357
to be more evolved in terms of the technology but right now you just can't,0.029699784
capture the personality and the detail of things with a computer everything here just looks,0.026898697
so real and authentic the atmosphere of it is incredible so creative they look like,0.017129809
they put so much effort into everything everything from the cars to the makeup and,0.015108316
the weapons everything it's just so over the top and it you feel like you,0.087495595
while you're watching it you feel like you're at the most adrenaline infused operatic rock,0.038844064
concert ever and actually there is even a guy who is you know on top,0.056873202
of one of the vehicles with a guitar electric guitar and there's fire coming out,0.10682051
of it and he's just like and as soon as I saw that I was,0.04160258
just like yes by that point you know exactly what kind of movie it is,0.023284754
and you just kind of have to go in headfirst and I think that the,0.16328728
cacophonous nature of the visual storytelling is balanced so well with what I said before,0.044273958
that simple story that's more kind of in the revenge Kill Bill style and each,0.2487468
character has something that is at stake or desires something that we can all connect,0.01351121
to emotionally you mean you've got max who's just trying to escape and he's got,0.04741695
all of this you know post-traumatic stress I guess you could say he's just basically,0.039779313
wanting to be liberated from this oppressive society and then you got Nicholas Hoult character,0.20244
who is quite manic and naive and he just wants to stand for something he,0.25822553
wants his life to have meaning before he dies and in there's furiosa who is,0.1731473
one of the female characters Charlize Theron and this character has been talked about a,0.02785789
lot I think more than any other aspect of the movie and actually somebody on,0.037528332
YouTube asked me what I thought about the if I thought it was feminist or,0.19769192
or what I think the movie is feminist but really I don't think it's consciously,0.24356754
I think it's just a movie that has happens to have very strong female characters,0.10740255
it and it's one of the very few films to portray a female in a,0.09507204
very realistic light as as realistic as Mad Max could be and it is not,0.040319443
feminist propaganda like some people think it is and because it's capturing all kinds of,0.22497702
different archetypes and how females are portrayed in different ways furiosa is just one of,0.07052211
the most badass female action heroes I've ever seen I mean she's tough and very,0.22441289
androgynous she's got a shaved head that's kind of been that Maria Falcon Eddie style,0.13955553
and if you get that reference there aren't any moments at least that I remember,0.00905448
watching the movie where she was once objectified where they even referred to her as,0.05225217
a female there isn't any competition or you know sexual tension that you usually see,0.18943898
in these kinds of action movies and Max and period as equals and I guess,0.02136836
the feminist aspect of the movie that we are all seeing is that furiosa is,0.09082883
trying to free all of these sex slaves basically there are these female slaves that,0.49911863
have this captor and the slave women even though they may be scantily clad and,0.3329973
they may not have the prowess of curiosa they do have their own kind of,0.078493
resourceful qualities so the movie is showing us different facets to masculinity and femininity like,0.08012536
on one hand George Miller the director is trying to show us women who are,0.046030708
able to prevail in a masculine environment and then other times I don't want to,0.032880694
give it away and I want to give away spoilers but other women do fall,0.30667165
victim to it and he's also showing us the pros and cons to an overtly,0.20930536
masculine world yes there may be a lot of very gruff masculine villains in the,0.13435446
movie but yet you do have a very mess man at the forefront of the,0.055939283
film max so the whole thing is very rounded it builds with tension in a,0.031891566
way that is very exciting and it's got an amazing flow to it it's got,0.030162087
an accessible storyline as I said that people can latch on to and even though,0.027171422
the plot is very similar to things that we see we've seen in the past,0.015698334
it doesn't have any of those action cliches that we're so used to like the,0.03919262
catch phrases and things like that it's so raw and entertaining and yet it feels,0.0513269
like it was made by human hands which unfortunately is rare in this day and,0.1884851
age to me it has all the makings of a classic so yeah it's just,0.064359844
