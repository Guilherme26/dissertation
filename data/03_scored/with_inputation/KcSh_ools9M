well greetings and salutations everybody welcome to my movie vlog my name is John Campea,0.11919958
and this is my review for the brand-new Guillermo del Toro movie the shape of,0.07765188
water I'm not quite sure what the shape of water is but it's a damn,0.60503596
good movie I'll tell you that there I just spoiled the lead for it I,0.15235184
love this film I really enjoy this movie we're gonna talk about a little bit,0.1552735
here now I'm actually doing this little video live because what I found is quite,0.11243212
often when I do movie review sometimes people will then ask questions of things I,0.11312701
didn't cover in the review so I thought you know what why not do this,0.042224254
live and let you guys ask me questions that you have about the movie once,0.13839485
I give my a little bit of a review for it so we're gonna do,0.11355929
that in just a second but right now let's get into the movie the shape,0.104030296
of water follows the character played by Sally Hawkins whose name is Eliza in the,0.029379603
film now it's kind of really funny and odd for me because this is the,0.06926421
same woman who played the mom in Paddington such a wholesome great little fun movie,0.3162171
and fun character and let me tell you something folks the shape of water is,0.055603437
not a family film no way no how it is not a family film and,0.07151055
I remember when I was watching one preview for it it said the following movie,0.043895543
contains graphic sexuality and nudity I'm winning and like wait wait wait what this movie's,0.5871083
gonna have that I mean surely it's just gonna be rated R because it's gonna,0.09800315
have some like really creepy graphic stuff it is Guillermo del Toro right and it's,0.18477727
gonna have some violence or whatever but I didn't think that and yep it does,0.14758788
just be prepared when you go in to watch the shape of water there's some,0.055337235
there's nudity and some graphic sexuality and things like that in there too which I,0.57290244
thought just added to the film to be honest with you but just give you,0.06371089
a heads up again though it was kind of jarring for me at first thinking,0.1733816
but this is the mom from Paddington come on but no really she is absolutely,0.13480824
magnificent anyway Eliza plays a mute woman she's not deaf but so she's mute so,0.5154597
she communicates in sign language and she works as an in janitorial service at this,0.10237319
government facility and at night she goes in and cleans up now as you saw,0.14865914
in the trailers what happens is this one government starts to hold or this government,0.047166206
agency starts to hold this sure that they found in their facility and of course,0.052266
the creature No contrary to popular belief even though it is played by Doug Jones,0.10181128
it is not AIDS sapien so who is also played by Doug Jones in another,0.091500096
gamble del Toro film but this facility starts to house this creature that they have,0.18368632
come across and discovered and of course Sally Hawkins as you can see in the,0.075312994
trailer starts to befriend the creature now also starring in the film playing our bad,0.1505142
guy is General Zod himself Michael Shannon who is spectacular in this film along with,0.2408938
them of course we also have Octavia Spencer who plays Eliza's best friend at work,0.07217993
she's fantastic and the absolutely unbelievable Richard Jennings who is in this film plays her,0.31089434
kind of her best friend and the only person in the world she's really really,0.08846752
close to they live in adjoining apartments and he's kind of her confidante and she,0.29743984
to him and I'm telling you right now if I had to vote today I,0.06562734
would vote for Richard Jennings to get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor,0.09334707
for this movie he was wonderful in it Sally Hawkins is gonna end up getting,0.23651235
a Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards she just is and she absolutely should,0.039465614
if she doesn't it's a bit of a snub if she doesn't get a Kadim,0.26326123
II award nomination for Best Actress in this absolutely now you would think by watching,0.05263099
the trailers as well and I'm not gonna give any spoilers in this thing here,0.09195197
you would think by watching the trailers that this movie is exclusively about you know,0.09190048
it's kind of a monster movie it's a little bit of a Pan's Labyrinth thing,0.4033918
where now she's gonna break out the monster blah blah but really the beautiful thing,0.44193065
about this movie is that there is so much more to it there is so,0.079976596
much heart and so much meaning in everything Guillermo del Toro does in this film,0.09493237
that to me really at its heart when you're looking at the characters played by,0.035943463
both Sally and Richard and even Octavia and even our villain Michael Shannon when you,0.154797
really look at this film what this movie is really about is about loneliness and,0.103800364
about belonging and finding your place preferably with somebody and that kind of theme is,0.075123854
echoed through each individual character in the movie and expressed in a different way by,0.05348247
each individual character in the movie to the point that I just I was falling,0.07029772
in love this story it's so much so that the creature that IMDB just refers,0.14927015
to as amphibian man that the creature in the film almost doesn't even have to,0.12609531
be a creature it could have just been another guy kind of filling that role,0.24996787
but the airmen of El Toro uses him as a creature to kind of tell,0.18048856
this tale from a fairy tale perspective you know what I mean it has great,0.11653581
cadence it has a great pace it has a great two or three little side,0.07076775
storylines that run throughout with various characters in the film as well but ultimately when,0.02006659
it comes down to it it's about Eliza this mute girl finding her place in,0.3585706
the weirdest of places this and phibian man this creature that they have and that,0.29515225
they're holding in the government facility and again all that you see in the trailers,0.06937312
but it's done so well with such heart and such care and such precision in,0.045455918
the hands of guillermo del toro I've heard some people say that they believe that,0.10409973
this is Del Toro's best film since Pan's Labyrinth I would actually put this on,0.06878537
par with Pan's Labyrinth now I know that that's really high praise because Pan's Labyrinth,0.07720104
is just crazy good but I would honestly put this movie on the same level,0.24247883
as Pan's Labyrinth just because it goes so much more beyond just what you see,0.053955976
on the surface and what you think the movies about just from the trailers and,0.04835098
goes into a real human movie about human experience in human emotion that I just,0.15142316
found myself completely enthralled with this movie right from the get-go now I got a,0.061631195
few other things to say about this movie but I also want to know if,0.08719059
you guys have any specific questions that don't go into spoiler detail but if you've,0.09563215
got any specific questions about the movie or specific observations about the movie you can,0.06523584
communicate those to me right now in one of two ways and I'll take them,0.19493695
from both number one you can hop on super chat obviously I get to every,0.14931834
single super chat number two you can jump on Twitter and tweet to me at,0.15239583
John Candy's just fire just jump on Twitter and fire off a tweet to me,0.33097476
at John Campea and let me know if you have any specific questions about this,0.093875416
movie and I'll spend the next ten minutes so taking questions continuing to talk about,0.06653014
this film so go ahead and start sending those out to me now now again,0.18279637
I want to talk about a couple of performances here and I'll go back to,0.07609527
Michael Shannon Michael Shannon I've always kind of said that one of the best villains,0.15114883
or the best kind of villain you can ever have in one of these movies,0.27187797
are the villains who do not see themselves as villains but rather villains who the,0.15447189
most dangerous of them are the ones who see themselves as the good guy and,0.39388442
Michael Shannon is definitely one of these types of villains he thinks he's the good,0.19191451
guy he thinks he's doing the right thing he thinks he's doing the good thing,0.1171234
and ultimately that's what makes him the most diabolical and the most dangerous of any,0.5520835
kind of cinematic villain he seems himself as the good guy and at times the,0.23333283
way del Toro shapes this movie you there are even moments in this film and,0.18858887
this is what makes del Toro so brilliant there are moments in this film where,0.065451644
you actually find yourself sympathizing a little bit with the Michael Shannon character again I'm,0.10702356
not gonna talk about how or why because I would be spoilers but there are,0.07556026
times that you find yourself sympathizing with him which only adds to the impact that,0.07269726
his character plays in the story it's so brilliantly done on that level like absolutely,0.0687492
brilliantly done on that level and you're swept up in all of it okay listen,0.33006006
we've got questions coming in about it so let me switch over to those now,0.09957663
I'm gonna start off with this one from Alex Gerber let's see Alex rates each,0.055989217
individual element was okay but it didn't come together for me however this movie wasn't,0.10642136
my first time getting to give my cinema score you know you know I'm not,0.11311547
totally surprised to hear that Alex because just like Pan's Labyrinth Pan's Labyrinth was a,0.07257088
movie that I thought was absolutely breathtakingly brilliant but that movie wasn't for everybody and,0.09036899
since I'm seeing a lot of similarities not that this movie's a copycat of that,0.1532152
other movie but just thematically because I see a lot of similarities between this film,0.10432534
and Pan's Labyrinth it's not gonna surprise me at all that this movie also will,0.1525411
not be for everybody it's not going to be for everybody but not everybody is,0.055836637
going to get this film not one sorry it's not that if you don't like,0.10684349
this film that that mean you don't get it not at all but what it,0.16785984
does mean is that I think this movie isn't going to touch everybody the same,0.08206388
way that Pan's Labyrinth did I think this movie is going to impact everybody the,0.1058426
same way just like Pan's Labyrinth didn't for everybody I don't expect this will be,0.07199643
for everybody - and if it doesn't strike you the right way that doesn't mean,0.066894434
there's anything wrong with you all film is subjective but for me it worked damn,0.64132136
well like it worked damn well ok next one comes us from Sam Fisher and,0.45457035
Sam Fisher writes I love this movie I think it's Del Toro's best movie since,0.08977191
Pan's Labyrinth I called Doug Jones at the Andy Serkis of practical creatures and yeah,0.106639236
Doug Jones has made a complete career out of being in gambrel del Toro's movies,0.10235906
but also being these practical effects creatures and actually you can currently see Doug Jones,0.10364038
in that new Star Trek show Star Trek oh why am I forgetting the name,0.05021112
of it Explorer a Star Trek whatever he's in the new Star Trek series on,0.09260978
CBS he plays like this alien captain and he's brilliant in it he's absolutely fantastic,0.25665218
in it so yes I completely agree all right next one the next question comes,0.031142235
to us from John Carr EP who writes how is the CGI okay I'll say,0.050282232
this this is what I'll say about the CGI the CGI is so good that,0.06677331
I couldn't tell you when it was CGI and when it wasn't I mean there,0.06593891
are a few little moments I could do that looks like it's something composited but,0.08702778
it's some minor little details but overall I don't know how much this is the,0.11138933
biggest compliment I can give to the CG in this movie I can't tell you,0.12355173
how much CG was in it I even I somebody who worked in the CGI,0.091358855
industry for a while I'm looking at this movie and I couldn't tell you if,0.073740356
that's visual effects or that's visual effects or not or just practical and that is,0.041094195
the biggest compliment I can give it so I don't know if del Toro used,0.11904541
hardly any CGI if we used a modest amount of CGI but there are very,0.05617078
very few moments in this movie that I can even think of that I even,0.08607803
thought was CGI and that's how good the effects in this thing actually ended up,0.09097936
being Sam Fisher's writing do you think Doug Jones will get an Oscar nomination no,0.05110967
no I don't think Doug Jones will get an Oscar nomination for this mostly because,0.033968195
well for a lot of reasons but a lot because I mean he doesn't that,0.07957498
may be considered I won't say that let's say this there are an awful lot,0.16305928
of very good Best Supporting Actor nominees this year so no I don't see him,0.09254583
nabbing one of those he's he's great as a creature absolutely he plays the part,0.36024278
wonderfully but no I don't see him getting an Academy Award nomination for this let's,0.050508704
see RC is writing in is this a more graphic Beauty and the Beast ooh,0.13453719
that's a you know what RC I have not thought of the movie in those,0.06167595
terms but uh you're not she not far off this theme Attica Lee at least,0.14876156
at any rate you will see some similarities between Beauty and the Beast it is,0.10811414
a more graphic version of that I wouldn't say it's a Beauty and the Beast,0.24262641
story but there are certainly similarities and nobody can blame you if you came out,0.1005778
of it drawing some parallels but overall I mean it's certainly these are two very,0.07513537
very different movies they are very very different movies but it's not far off the,0.057236522
way you're drawing those similarities so yeah I think you could say that you wouldn't,0.12409435
be completely wrong to say this is a more graphic kind of beauty in the,0.08489538
beast but it's certainly one is not completely connected to the other Alex Gerber right,0.18639193
wrote in again I meant to say was my first time with CinemaScore know I,0.058885686
get what you're saying don't worry I understand what you're saying Alex don't worry about,0.14874451
it the uzi 4:08 says I don't know why you decided to waste your money,0.31115925
to tell us a joke but writes in a joke what do you call it,0.15131618
when Batman skips Church Christian Bale huh love what you do thank you so much,0.1624988
the Uzi for it I appreciate that as well alright so let me jump over,0.1671756
then now to Twitter and see what some people are saying in Twitter we will,0.085785076
start off with Lesley 22800 in an Oscar absolutely it's good at this movie is,0.11752926
going to get nominated in some of the big categories you're going to see Sally,0.12782523
Hawkins get nominated for Best Actress you're I believe you're gonna see Guillermo del Toro,0.0727635
nominated for Best Director and I believe very strongly you're gonna see the shape of,0.052480265
water getting native for best picture so there's gonna be a big Oscar presence for,0.080196574
this how many it will win who knows we're not really sure how many words,0.08427926
it will actually win but it's going to be a very very big presence let's,0.06841227
see this one comes us from Stephen thanks sixteen says is the shape of water,0.052931897
as darkest pans or lighter in the story there are very different films from each,0.08018185
other and both have very dark elements in their own way if I had to,0.057527848
just give us plain and simple thing I guess I would say that the shape,0.10992188
of water is a little lighter I guess I would say that it feels weird,0.066919394
saying that but I suppose you could say if one you had to say was,0.07847524
a little bit darker than the other I would say Pan's Labyrinth is probably just,0.15544958
a little bit darker than the shape of water is but I mean they're both,0.19206707
have some very dark elements and both have some lighter very emotional heartfelt elements as,0.047499694
well but I'll say the slightly darker one will go over two we will go,0.090704195
over to say Pan's Labyrinth is slightly darker this next one comes to us from,0.087958485
homes or Simpson who writes John this movie really shows hollywood's double standard we see,0.07733092
tons of female out Anatomy but no fish Anatomy double standard in Hollywood put more,0.19061737
efficient atomy on the screen thanks a lot for the comment let's see this next,0.083259754
one comes to us from T Olli reviews who writes John do you think shape,0.098588526
of water can get an Oscar nomination and do you think it's deserved well as,0.04881006
I just mentioned in the previous question I do I think it's going to get,0.029270615
several of the major categories it's going to get nominated a couple of the major,0.062979914
categories and probably a couple like makeup costuming some other categories like that I could,0.08424798
see the shape of water picking up minimum 5 nominations minimum 5 maybe even more,0.034180686
we'll have to see now I don't think it's a shoo-in to win necessarily any,0.11155913
of them but I'm thinking we're gonna get at least 5 of these things we,0.066953175
go over to this one this one comes us from Walter who writes John which,0.08784313
is better the last gen a or the shape of water well the last gen,0.12222819

the compliment I appreciate that Sam Fisher is writing it out the name of the,0.058715403
show that you can see Doug Jones in who plays the amphibious creature in this,0.2277224
movie is Star Trek discovery he plays first officer sir ooh that's how he plays,0.07031395
