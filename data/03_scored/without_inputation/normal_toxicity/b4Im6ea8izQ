Ragnarok or as it soon going to become known in the porn community,0.599304
so a ragna is directed by ty y - 2 y t - t t wait it's ty Y titty it's it's tight it II did - YT - 2 t - tai tai chi chi chi like i was doomed to mispronounce this guy's name from the moment i heard who was directing this film so i'm just gonna call him ty ty or titty i'm just gonna call him tight side titty for the rest of this review i'm very sorry sir but I'm very bad with names and I just I can't remember your name,0.7140862
wait it's directed by him and this is the third,0.07233351
Thor film in the MCU,0.051012374
"and this is the I don't know 25,000 MCU film that we've had or at least 16 this film once again stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor Tom Hiddleston is back as Loki you've got Cate Blanchett playing the villain hella in this movie and also Mark Ruffalo shows up as the hulk thor ragnarok is a comic that is basically built around the demise of Asgard the destruction of the Asgardians the death of the gods it's pretty much apocalypse for Thor's homeland and everyone in it and the movie they take this concept",0.15831368
and they apply it to a broader range buddy cop comedy type of feel,0.097215585
Thor gets trapped on this planet he runs into Hulk and he has to try to get to as guard because hella the goddess of death is trying to wreak havoc on Asgard,0.27822545
she's trying to destroy Asgard,0.31089434
so Thor needs to figure out a way to work together with Hulk to get off this planet so that they can go to Asgard and somehow find a way to stop the goddess of death I'm not gonna lie,0.22862172
if this movie did nothing else like if this movie failed at pretty much everything else,0.1539868
the one thing that it did not fail at is entertainment value,0.07783163
if this movie if all this movie was trying to do was set out to entertain you,0.16702467
and give you a fun time at the movies well guess what it executed,0.48582488
its game plan,0.05742591
I can't deny that this is an entertaining movie doesn't mean,0.058731236
I was entertained for all of it doesn't even mean that I enjoyed all of it what I can say though is they can't really walk out of this movie going well that wasn't entertaining that was boring,0.10109108
no this movie hits you with the entertainment factor the action sequences and the cinematography probably better than any of the other Thor movies that have come before it somebody who hasn't been overly impressed with the action sequences from the other Thor movies they're okay,0.076645695
they're alright but in this movie ty White City or Titan II,0.12626061
he does a really good job at giving these is a chance to be badasses,0.31089434
so where is way more of a badass in this movie than he was in the previous films,0.31089434
Hulk was a badass in this movie Valkyrie was a badass in this movie played by an actress that I once again can't remember her name really a lot of people in this movie kicked ass,0.8595799
and I think that the action sequences in general were filmed better CGI was better,0.031985525
during these action cygnus movie is definitely going for it in terms of the humor,0.12648875
it takes everything that you thought you knew about Thor from the previous movies and it tries to apply a more comedic touch to it for me that personally has some mixed results,0.057024762
but overall,0.052775852
I can't deny there were definitely a few scenes in this movie where I was laughing my ass off,0.8120466
in particular some of the interactions between Loki and Thor I mean those guys have always had great chemistry those guys have always been those great Shakespearean brothers with a lot of great stuff between them both emotionally and from a comedy standpoint so got some funny moments between Thor and Hulk in particular when Thor and Hulk first run into each other there is some really funny that goes on in that fight that you saw in the trailer,0.10939011
I'm just gonna say that that was probably the part of the movie that I laughed the hardest,0.093879655
I also got a single out Cate Blanchett as hella,0.26799834
Cate Blanchett does a really good job at playing a really evil woman,0.5876557
so she was is evil in every scene that she's in in this movie she's a brilliant actress,0.49418476
and how old is this chick again she's like I don't know 60 or something,0.63442564
but somehow she still looks like she's 25,0.11268567
I don't know how Cate Blanchett has mastered the art of immortality,0.11646982
but I don't know maybe,0.08243565
she's the evil witch from Snow White in the Huntsman and she just keeps herself looking young by sucking off everybody out wow that didn't sound right at all let me boss it rewind that I'm not saying Cate Blanchett sucks people off to get younger,0.8133668
I'm saying that somehow she has mastered the art of being younger by possibly draining the life force from other people,0.1871124
but I was so conflicted walking out of this movie because listen I'm not a huge Thor fan but I am a big fan of the Thor Ragnarok comic and usually when I'm comparing source material to the media that is being portrayed in I try to separate it I try to go you know what artistic freedom they can take license they can change some as long as it works for the movie and I'm kind of torn because the thor ragnarok comic the one that i love the one that I read this movie doesn't really feel like thor ragnarok and that's probably the biggest criticism that I can have a movie called,0.06682379
thor,0.05960106
ragnarok is that it doesn't really feel like thor ragnarok how the tension and the stakes,0.076410726
aren't really there,0.051060304
and when they are there the movie in my opinion compromises the tension and the stakes and the elevated gravity of the situation by throwing in another joke I mean I'm pretty sure this movie can't go like two or three minutes without shoving another joke down your throat get me wrong,0.2754674
some of those jokes are funny,0.068812035
and I laughed at some of them but sometimes I feel like it was a clashing of tones,0.11977837
I feel like part of the movie is trying to be an apocalyptic end of days for Asgardians,0.15514977
it's supposed to be this big epic thing,0.1055045
and the other part of the movie is kind of this self-contained comedy that takes place on another planet,0.21736442
and there's just a whole bunch,0.081245504
of jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes being thrown at you probably loosely about 50 jokes per minute I mean that's what it felt like at times it felt like improv at the comedy theater because if there wasn't a joke being thrown at you there was you know really cool 80s music playing while of really epic action sequences knowing and so you feel like I don't know I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this has been called the most hilarious Marvel movie ever for me,0.13084443
I laughed a few times but I really don't think the movie is as funny as other people made it out to be,0.110502526
but again humor is a subjective thing that could just be me,0.040084805
then there are some other instances in this movie of lazy storytelling,0.22280078
where I feel like there are characters from previous films who are either in this movie or not in this movie,0.054678116
and their absence or lack thereof is kind of unexplained in a way there are things that happen in this movie that have very poor explanations,0.1312774
there are things that happen in this movie where you feel like it's glossed over,0.10578882
and it's a very hasty storytelling characters from previous movies there are characters from this movie and you feel like things just kind of happen around their characters,0.05365293
I can't really spoil and I didn't really flesh out some of the arcs and some of the characters and some of the story elements not just for previous movies but from this movie that could have used a little bit more attention,0.059688866
but instead they sacrificed that to tell another joke,0.1299048
I want to make it seem like I'm bitching about thor ragnarok,0.53490317
I mean the movie again is entertaining,0.07884231
and if that's all you wanted if that's all you're going into this movie for mission accomplished the movie has entertained,0.08502502
I feel like the flaws of the movie in this case kind of way with the positives because for every moment in this movie that I liked or I smile is another moment in this movie that I rolled my eyes at or I hate it and so I can't really in good conscience say that this movie is anything better than average much,0.18557966
as it pains me to say this store Ragnarok while entertaining is an average movie right in the fortress of solitude,0.17652453
I hope everybody else loves it,0.07518352
I didn't personally love it but I'm rooting for the movie to do it big at the box office,0.077934116
