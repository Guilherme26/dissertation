silence your cell phones now sympathy marchers i'm very aware of that mr hoover what,0.24989323
i do know is he's non-violent what i need to know right now what's martin,0.16024224
luther king about to do next what's going on youtube welcome back to the movie,0.14904934
experience and yes i know i said that the movie experience uh is only on,0.07406098
the weekends we gotta catch up on the new movies every weekend but this time,0.075121075
it is a very historical day this is martin luther king jr holiday and today,0.072506495
we are going to review some of the martial kingdom movies and i'm doing one,0.13753767
of my favorite movies hands down uh i thought this is one of the best,0.12894662
uh interpretations of martin king jr story and that is selma summer is directed by,0.03869069
avery duvernay who is famously known for directing uh some of the great stuff like,0.07998228
we see a documentary netflix called 13 that was a a great documentary as well,0.06328693
i know she did a wrinkle in time and a lot of things people weren't,0.077968456
wearing today movie like that but uh someone when it first came out this is,0.09179792
this put every dude on the mat because it was between either her elite daniels,0.15062597
doing this movie and leave dance to at the time took note to do the,0.09752308
butler now don't get wrong i do enjoy the butler and i think i the,0.14186461
butler i will be reviewing for black history month as well but when it comes,0.38030767
to some i think ava junior was the perfect one to to capture this so,0.07782989
this is the story of martin king during 1965 during the uh when he's trying,0.05599254
to go for the voting rights uh act we get to vote right next in,0.04516825
1965 but we would go for uh african-americans right to vote down in selma alabama,0.53197575
so we're only taking place in this one section of water king side martin king,0.076928206
has a very hefty life obviously and one day i know people would like to,0.1407748
see a whole movie of a brainstem but there are some so many events in,0.2035129
martin king's life that weren't just a detailed one movie type thing for instance boycott,0.15853378
starring jeffrey white was the hbo when we got back in 2001 they had just,0.10884492
to focus on the montgomery bus boycott and i was thinking like one thing you,0.13508856
can do with it with monitor king if you can't make a full movie and,0.06207626
like because it's going to be a long movie i think it needs to be,0.10391902
like and kind of like an mcu kind of series and thing where different sections,0.10409321
of his events of his life that they can take a movie to focus on,0.113493264
that like the boycott uh birmingham and then you know nobel peace prize and then,0.21319897
selma to chicago vietnam like there's so many things you could do to stick it,0.117907286
all up in there i was wondering somebody may do that but uh this is,0.06449226
starring dave royello as the role of martin luther king and uh we making her,0.07416246
return to uh at the cinema because she played coretta scott king in uh boycott,0.19253275
she comes back to play correct scott king again as a karma eldrigo i know,0.15250768
i pronounced that her name wrong always do and this was a a movie written,0.25711757
by paul webb and also produced by oprah winfrey so let's get on into some,0.057312656
i'm gonna get into the good i'm gonna get to the bed and i'm gonna,0.5514707
get into well the sport this movie came out it's old right now and i,0.12987715
did not have a youtube channel around when this movie was out so i i,0.17222595
just it came out late 2014 went into movie theaters in january 2015 and then,0.04071682
my youtube channel didn't start until may of 2015 so i never got around to,0.07172141
reviewing it so now i get it going so now start off with the good,0.10159981
starting off david o'yellow and captures the spirit of martin luther king jr there have,0.095712736
been a lot of people that played dr martin luther king i like paul winfield,0.055945624
the ministers even though i think the ministers was terrible i do like uh jeffrey,0.2066867
white and boycott but he represents more than young king this uh the real world,0.3263184
represents a lot of the season martin luther king jr and i i enjoyed that,0.08779109
him and um what we just seen in my range black bottom uh coleman domingo,0.2468256
who plays ralph abernathy those two really capture the essence of martin king and rob,0.18577135
that nothing in their friendship everybody does a great job that because since i am,0.1391176
into this era history and i just study it she brings out characters and first,0.05822883
of all this was cast wonderfully everybody that plays the part of their characters looks,0.04439496
like their character would back in 1965. and a lot of times with these big,0.049723778
cell rice movies you get the big names you get the monster kings you get,0.506096
the ralph albinos you get to andrew young's but there's a lot of people that,0.24502277
played a part in this that you do not necessarily get and she went out,0.08937975
and she is uh teaching the audience of all these other uh heroes in the,0.086495325
civil rights movement and young heroes and older heroes people that doesn't know about such,0.10338153
as common plays of the reverend james bevel who's not really mentioned in a lot,0.10023832
of movies but he's just documentaries a lot of people don't watch america sometimes they,0.17048831
think they're boring uh tessa thompson plays diane nash he does a great job as,0.24232334
dying nashes also they bring in at john lewis now john lewis obviously we know,0.1455456
about john lewis a lot of people know more more about the royal jungle especially,0.103687994
after this past year and of course you know a lot of people really love,0.05532046
know john those but they don't but they bring she brings john williams in here,0.1384562
hosea williams comes to my jimmy lee jackson played by the keith stanfield who did,0.09588882
a great job as well fred gray and all and all these other people even,0.24213764
uh james orange these are all sclc members that play an important part of what,0.34646153
happened down in some alabama and going on into that so i i like how,0.22033326
she takes time to introduce us to a lot of new characters also while still,0.11455308
putting the spotlight on on the main players but also putting the spotlight on number,0.11040778
two and show that they they had a significant role in this uh plot and,0.15031394
one thing i liked about the movie also is that it wasn't just okay this,0.081475906
this place is a problem we're going to march uh we're going to piss the,0.46384647
white folks off we're going to get our rights to vote and that's what that's,0.54245096
what's going to be no evidence humanizes these things because you got to understand that,0.19336015
in this time there's a lot going on and every time just like the whole,0.054530352
town is against you you are a mark in that town you coming in there,0.31089434
into their eyes to stir up trouble so you're already a marked man to be,0.31089434
dead she shows the uh the human side of martin king in this movie where,0.4657402
he's not a martyr he's not the saint that a lot of people put him,0.23768257
up to be and because you know he was nonviolent that that king has flaws,0.14923364
like every human being on this earth has flaws okay and you know some are,0.17240071
greater than others you know say and even even with him doing so much good,0.10781702
he had flaws and he he was scared a lot of times and it's going,0.119733475
into it we look like a history like wait they took care of their problem,0.13379115
to 68 but it king's eyes he was supposed to be dead that day so,0.2709101
she brings a lot of uh human aspects to it even when uh it comes,0.24021158
to the fbi and you know being under the letter to correct his house about,0.15485139
him cheating on her like that was a very tough scene that she did put,0.42725062
in the movie it was also the scene where malcolm x comes to selma and,0.036222532
then he didn't like michael mix coming to someone's turn of all the shuttle trouble,0.09489054
of all the good they have done down south because he was all up in,0.15322024
the north and they don't usually put that or talk about that when they talk,0.072618574
about selma when it comes to that kind of moves like that or even small,0.07019701
kind of documentary so those those things as somebody who watched me i appreciate that,0.08427748
i grabbed on today and i loved all of it and it wasn't that you,0.3523224
know black folks all unified at that time they showed that the slick didn't like,0.6203733
sclc coming down and getting up in their business they felt as though that they,0.25414717
they could do a job at an sclc but the people wanted scf martin kenny,0.33763194
come down that's why you know uh james farmer and john lewis it was clashing,0.15872277
his i like seeing it it it it shows you know reality everybody's not just,0.15678133
like because we're black we all go get we're going to get along and go,0.5154597
out there and do this that's the same thing what's going on in this country,0.08968366
right now just because everybody's black and you feel it was like okay well you,0.48067033
can actually different people with black lives matter means and you'll get 13 different answers,0.73092085
okay so there's always so many different ways to try to handle things but you,0.1142484
know they're going to be a difference of opinion and she put and she put,0.09810804
that in there and i think that was um that was really good uh tim,0.07001683
roth comes uh comes here as joe uh george wallace i think he did a,0.31089434
great job as that like he made me really hate him so that that that,0.44732887
was his uh his job in here and he got a lot of a lot,0.097507946
out of name after that you play smaller roles but they are bigger actors that,0.0745266
are playing a part oprah winfrey cooper good junior just named this name a few,0.052818198
so they were uh really really good in the movie now i could go i,0.11482526
really can go on all day about this movie what i would not now stop,0.17945655
and talk about how many days i like let's get into some of the things,0.116281345
about the bad that you know that probably you know could have been done better,0.09791339
so when it comes to the bed some of the things i like that there,0.14931695
was these slow motion shots that even do when they use to the point i,0.18919231
was just like i understand it's trying to capture the moment in the impact and,0.039153628
i think it just went on just a little bit too long i'm not i'm,0.19441149
afraid look i watch that sniper stuff okay so i i'm a fan of slow,0.43924966
motion stuff but there were times i was just like just uh pick it up,0.071741745
just a little bit it comes like just a little bit too long but you,0.31089434
know see it doesn't doesn't hurt the movie by no means at all and it's,0.05664035
a personal thing of mine it's just like um every time we do a period,0.12478133
piece movie where we talk about one certain thing we we get all the details,0.082048684
leading up to it but then when we get to the end like like the,0.06706842
victory march we kind of rushed through the end and i'm like i would have,0.15246153
liked to see you know whenever it makes it the end and then him he,0.15048476
said make it into the it did the march from summit to montgomery that he,0.11054537
did the speech at the montgomery capitol but i would like to them see the,0.0798207
voter you know have them signed and then johnson signed the voter rights act and,0.05104513
you know um how some of the people that came down there to help them,0.10847208
out i mean they did talk about a lot of people they know a lot,0.12315217
of the people that came down to help like james reid you know the white,0.4595933
uh pastor that came down who was killed so they do go in today and,0.40312237
like these are nitpicks of mine because of how into the history i am but,0.1793026
those certain things i probably couldn't you know enjoy enjoy a little bit more but,0.16451193
guys uh but then uh there really is no spoilers i'm gonna say if people,0.26446682
say this movie's about five years old and there's really no sports it's really going,0.061272703
by the history of it so there's really no experience of sports i'm not i'm,0.056614608
gonna cut that part out uh i'm just gonna tell you right now that you,0.40308782
i recommend you guys go out there and check out some i can really go,0.18159664
on and on about this all one day this is one of the best monitor,0.0765422
king movies they ever made i i really think that when it comes to his,0.08790461
life when it comes to a a period piece for each part of his life,0.19150394
as a movie that would be good like a whole kind of anthology type thing,0.15138385
using same actors i'm cool it kind of like an mcu type thing as opposed,0.12519453
to making one long movie because there are a lot of points that's going to,0.07231357
be left out everybody needs to be in there such as the michael makes movie,0.06340333
i love the malcolm x movie and uh like i said macabre is a little,0.06574366
bit more easier to do because of what happened in his life but there was,0.15208074
still portions of the michael mix movie that they left out and i'm just like,0.08418834
because it was already over in a three-hour territory i'm just like see it it,0.09800507
could have been done you know like that that whole one night in miami they,0.060106322
took that whole part out you know saying him and catches clay thing i was,0.07104315
i kind of want to see that but i'm telling you guys right now i'm,0.08587593
going to give selma a complete nerdgasm i recommend you guys go out there ron,0.67406243
king day check out some if you guys have not seen some already you're going,0.1320201
to see certain things check out boycott king was the mainstream that came out 1978,0.112088144
and me personally it's it's so badly written it really is paul winfield systems do,0.16360302
a great job but it's so badly written and the story's all over the place,0.11412674
especially for people who know the story i'm gonna say you can go watch if,0.08964929
you want to they they play it every year on tv one or bt or,0.05884572
so you go check it out but if you guys see some you guys into,0.09587431
