the farewell was directed by Lulu Wang and stars aquafina as Billy a young woman,0.1046804
who learns that her grandmother has a very short time left to live much to,0.3151564
her surprise she discovers her entire family has decided not to tell her grandmother that,0.21963832
she's going to die instead they arrange a wedding ceremony as an excuse for everyone,0.60470986
to come to China to see her one last time before she passes and since,0.0985699
some of them are having a very hard time figuring out whether or not they,0.099981666
want to approach her about this illness or at least trying to hide it it,0.17690733
creates for an extremely entertaining movie and one that really touched me to be honest,0.1295394
and I don't experience that too much in the theaters nowadays movies have kind of,0.061268143
forgotten how to grab you by the heart there's only a few that come out,0.31089434
a year that really know how to do it without being too sappy or sentimental,0.1709771
to the point of unbelievab ility but this film is able to approach this subject,0.15566853
from a well of knowledge about this culture since this is a true story the,0.051318135
film opens with text that says based on an actual lie because the director of,0.21952084
this film went through this exact scenario and she's written about it and made a,0.075042464
beautiful movie and one that consistently kept my interest with complex characters that felt like,0.06145102
they were real people that didn't seem like movie characters the film was comfortable enough,0.071155615
to have long sequences with people just having conversations and some of these conversations are,0.062363334
really fascinating oftentimes one of the biggest notes that screenwriters get especially SPECT writers is,0.14605993
that all people are talking too much right now people are saying too much let's,0.10082315
get things moving let's have something happen this film is perfectly content to show an,0.07489181
entire sequence in which people just have an argument over dinner about whether or not,0.08226243
moving to America from China was really worth it is the American dream really everything,0.115488
that is cooked up to be and it was one of the most fascinating scenes,0.11085593
in the entire film and this movie has a lot of sequences like that but,0.06311255
I don't want to make it seem like it's a total drag this movie is,0.14917699
actually really funny and similar to 5050 in tone specifically in that it's a film,0.07666099
that's also about a terrible illness and a very sad thing but it's able to,0.14634798
find the levity in these moments and able to find the entertainment value in the,0.15260838
moments both films were also written as a form of catharsis for the person who,0.05220873
went through the event but one of the reasons this movie stands out so much,0.07458071
is awkwafina and her honestly show-stopping performance I really did not expect this from someone,0.13066688
who in the past has mostly been a comedic supporting role someone who kind of,0.08888475
comes in gets some laughs and then disappears and then comes back get some laughs,0.1764892
and disappears and he or she is front and center for most of the movie,0.081985354
and she's marvelous such an incredible actress she has shown so much range in this,0.084998146
film and I can't wait to see what else she does as a writer and,0.14662686
a director she's very smart with her choices she sets up certain things early on,0.09876106
in the movie that at first get a laugh and they're very cute and it's,0.12951565
just a great scene but later on in the film you find there's a much,0.05714114
deeper meaning to some of these things that you learned earlier and thought we're just,0.059310496
there for a laugh sometimes that can be called hidden exposition the idea of showing,0.09471239
us a scene with something and then as an audience we think okay that has,0.052876785
now served its purpose in the story and then later you realized that was actually,0.04576049
just set up for something more important and something more impactful and without getting into,0.069032095
it I thought the ending in particular was really beautiful it made me think for,0.15998408
the entire drive home which was like 30 minutes so I had a lot of,0.067143396
time to toss it around in my head there are so many great themes woven,0.444061
throughout this story that is somehow able to approach them with comedy and equal parts,0.102397144
drama and this doesn't happen often with movies but I learned something while watching this,0.07565131
movie I had no idea that this was a common practice in China the idea,0.09999292
of being uncomfortable with telling a loved one that they are going to pass soon,0.10097263
and I had no idea that that it was so widely accepted and so it's,0.07451168
interesting because you get to see awkwafina's character Billy she's struggling with that because she's,0.101630345
lived in America for a long time now and it's really hard for her to,0.12568884
accept this at first and it's something that she just has to this movie wasn't,0.09367536
mindless you know it felt like it had something to say it felt like it,0.3973026
meant something which is so rare anymore with films this movie came with weight it,0.14517117
had meaning very early on and it always felt relevant every single minute felt really,0.054086603
important to this filmmaker and I'm seeing movies where you can tell the story means,0.07001536
something to this director like they're telling this story because they have to get it,0.072287984
off their chests like it's important to them and I felt that there almost every,0.15544699
minute of the farewell if I were to get really nitpicky about the film there,0.050679605
are times where the pacing drags a little bit there are some sequences that feel,0.09512161
stretched on a little bit too long particularly a third act ceremony that kind of,0.24173392
goes and goes and goes there's a karaoke scene there's like a lot of speeches,0.12934726
and sometimes the speeches don't really feel like they add much to the story they,0.04930488
just kind of feel like well we have to have this bit where the character,0.09903064
says a speech because they're the lead character and they have to say a speech,0.08258757
but then the speech doesn't really say much and so it kind of feels like,0.05406666
wasted time there's just a few scenes like that where it feels as if maybe,0.11046151
a little bit could have been cut and that's about it honestly it's also kind,0.23699556
of remarkable this movie is rated PG like I can't even remember the last time,0.1252345
I saw a PG movie in the theaters that wasn't like a cartoon or like,0.08034562
a family animated film like it's it's very strange I'm not used to that but,0.08389969
it's welcome I'm gonna give the farewell and a - guys thank you so much,0.1441741
as always for watching look forward to more reviews very soon and if you like,0.08010551
