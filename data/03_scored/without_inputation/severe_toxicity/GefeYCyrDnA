that reason alone have you not seen the trailers and early knowing that is directed,0.01646396
by Alfonso Khurana I had to check this movie yeah I did not know the,0.030946339
UH I'd seen the poster but I did not expect this movie to be as,0.01504978
artsy as I was look this movie is not for everyone if you don't like,0.04067066
having to read subtitles if you don't like walking at black-and-white movie isn't all that,0.09940238
noir style and all that you will not like this movie and this isn't your,0.09358801
cup of tea but at the same time I'm the type of person who loves,0.040301483
those movies I love going back and watching movies like some like it hot for,0.09322615
the style of the noir and I love watching foreign films like wreckin last year,0.04126134
a movie that I thought was not as scary as people made it out to,0.046833586
me but a movie I thought was very effective as a horror film and that,0.06530507
was the Spanish film Veronica I love watching foreign films I think that's some of,0.022866353
the best out there so going into this movie none of that really had any,0.042502575
issue on me I thought that was actually one of the reasons why this movie,0.06289511
works so well because it actually had me captivated I wanted to watch it more,0.063235685
because they had something for me to follow in the way of the art style,0.030201998
and also the fact I had to read the subtitles not necessarily that's a problem,0.016867062
it did distract me a little bit from certain things but it also was a,0.037436534
reason to follow the characters and read into them a lot more I found making,0.026640605
it a lot more personal and with me that's not unordinary for me to feel,0.06279666
that way when I watch foreign films or movies with subtitles I've actually found that,0.034420595
has a big positive about them except for what the waters left behind which was,0.0258058
a Spanish horror film that I saw earlier in the year at a film festival,0.039138075
that I personally really didn't enjoy to the point I didn't even bother reviewing and,0.031620834
I thought it was quite bad but at the same time foreign films love them,0.05611223
and I love to this film I think all the performances are absolutely fantastic I,0.05206326
don't know the names of any of these I should have researched and what their,0.01564778
names were before this but I think everyone did a really good job actually um,0.020922687
what is it portraying from script to screen there are motion the Alfonzo Quran directed,0.02084619
the act is so well on screen and now they were what is it position,0.024456142
and acted around the set because this looks fairly low-budget I don't know the budget,0.03269311
of this movie let me check that really quickly actually it was about 15 million,0.032528147
so not the biggest budget in the world and I think the way he directed,0.043159112
the actors is absolutely fantastic and the emotion and the hardship that he managed the,0.03171263
betray was really really damn good like there is an actress and here at first,0.31464666
time actors I don't know her name for the life of me or be here,0.049366605
in the screen or whatever but at the same time her performance in this movie,0.021456828
was beyond captivating and I honestly think she's up for Oscar nominations for one of,0.041897256
the Best Actress roles everyone in this movie gives their all and they're all Oscar,0.023622002
worthy actresses actors will you name it that are all absolutely fantastic and how the,0.07098773

for the actors not just with the director of Alfonso Cuaron which I'll get into,0.038184203
a minute but also as the viewers because you followed them aim delved into the,0.06594897
story quite in-depth now a lot of people made this had to be Alfonso Cuaron's,0.02658207
passion project and that shows because this movie seems so personal to him in the,0.034529682
web how much he does this and it was only informed by any last night,0.034868263
before I sat down and watch this movie by Dylan actually texted me saying that,0.067751616
iPhones the Quran did the cinematography himself and the thing is I think this maybe,0.094255194
should be nominated for Best Cinematography because this movie from the stylistic choices to the,0.022745289
way the movie is shot in the cinematography and the framing this is such a,0.05967695
gorgeous looking movie in every single way also the use of lighting which I don't,0.07258018
