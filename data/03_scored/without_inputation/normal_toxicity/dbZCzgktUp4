spotlight is the most important movie about investigative journalism since all the president's men but for some reason it's not making the same impression with the general public which I found incredibly frustrating when I was leaving the theater because I thought the movie was so good I was like man why are more people talking about this,0.12981047
why is almost everyone in this theater,0.07649898
a senior citizen,0.049099304
why is spotlight getting swept under the rug,0.1675723
so I saw this movie on Saturday night and I thought about it,0.10046061
and I thought about it,0.055995513
and I not only came up with two reasons,0.12636766
why this movie isn't getting more coverage and is it making more of an impression but also in the course of finding out those two reasons and discovering them I also came to the realization that the movie is deeply flawed but you should still see it,0.081570275
and I'm gonna tell you why,0.07685462
but first why spotlight is not connecting the first is that,0.053451397
and these are my own investigative notes that I have right here,0.05866008
the first is that there are some things that the public no matter how horrific and unjust,0.18781532
they're just not willing to acknowledge,0.1854463
and it seems that the dark side of the Catholic,0.13158232
Church is one of those things I mean just look at the aftermath of this story actually breaking because this is a true story the Catholic Church still around and nobody really seems to want to confront this look at all the people who showed up to see the Pope,0.14940153
even though they know yeah,0.05827378
well I don't want to give away the details of the story because I think they're very important to discover along with the film but I think you'll be surprised when the film is done that the Catholic Church seems so unscathed and despite of everything that's happened,0.13426283
and I think that you know in contrast I'm going to contrast law with all the president's men because they're similar films nobody has an emotional attachment to the government,0.19889827
so people were happy to have that change how they felt about the government,0.07196923
so you saw a much bigger actual reaction from the public when they learned about that scandal than the church scandal,0.106105
so the the public basically the number,0.05956552
one thing is the public has already said we're not interested in the church Catholic Church scandal,0.14461401
we're not going to acknowledge it,0.104308024
so perhaps open road is aware of this,0.04955652
so that's why they've created it,0.07529715
the number two reason this movie isn't connecting and that's because open road,0.06359283
and I think that's a some degree the film itself an open road is the distributor,0.07499871
I've decided that this is a movie about investigative journalism only and that's all they're focusing on I saw some awards coverage actually variety reach retweeted it out or sent to that as an email to people on their email lists,0.08573914
and I'm one of them being like did you miss this spotlight discussion because nobody's talking about spotlight and they were like oh it's talking about investigative journalism,0.10080221
that's what this movie is about and I'm like no,0.077868626
I don't think this movie is totally about investigative journalism,0.11443206
and you know that's that's the wrong play,0.09803399
here,0.053441156
I mean think about just even the title of the movie it's spotlight whereas the title of all the president's men referenced the scandal,0.12202999
but this movie's title references to people who uncovered the scandal,0.090645075
and while intellectually that might be the right hook because of number one with people saying you know what I don't want to acknowledge the Catholic Church scandal emotionally,0.31089434
it's not the right play,0.0862582
and it's not enough,0.15080668
I think oh poor investigative journalism,0.1425581
that's not enough to get people to really pay attention to this movie now of course investigative journalism is important is important,0.10268896
and this movie is about investigative journalism,0.095388636
and actually when I was watching the film I was like wow these people should be paid,0.17935921
more,0.04303453
this is just horribly,0.3422672
you know this is unjust as well and I would actually liken it to Trumbo a movie also playing right,0.12532796
now the people also aren't paying any attention to that talks about the importance of screenwriting,0.080833405
and I think that both of these movies highlight how we're becoming a culture devoid of substance or at least where substance is not valued and that that's pretty alarming all by itself,0.14546263
but investigative journalism particularly in this context and in the context of all the president's men but even more so here because wait wait for it wait for it because I've done the work that this movie only a little bit did investigative journalism is just the tool,0.13661534
and the real story here is the scandal and the people who uncovered that scandal,0.11211761
now what the with the scandal Mark Ruffalo's character I mean they the movie touches on these things,0.119372286
but it doesn't do a good enough job of driving at home,0.07599935
it's like it's like investigative journalism that just puts all the facts up there but doesn't frame it for you doesn't give it a voice doesn't give a perspective,0.09422001
and that's what I think this movie is missing to some degree I would liken it a little bit to the wolf of Wall Street for Martin Scorsese which also failed to have a creative voice to have perspective to have you have the film to have itself and offer some kind of judgment,0.08753147
not judgment as in what's right or wrong,0.076633684
but you know again you know a few point,0.07201404
but anyway Mark Ruffalo's character says something very interesting during the movie and he says when he fit when he learns the actual details of what happened with the church over decades something in his belief of the church cracks it just cracks,0.07554305
and I thought kind of had a similar experience as well watching the movie and I think that they as I said with Watergate,0.08204429
people didn't have an emotional connection to the government,0.09312295
so they were willing to be like,0.04623784
yeah the government is evil,0.51117235
oh thanks for telling me uh you know Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward I appreciate it but here this is the church this is a big part of people's lives it's their Savior,0.1031379
it's God,0.06605985
so people are like,0.054029778
I don't want to know why'd you tell me,0.111078
so I think that's kind of the reaction,0.087886475
that's there,0.03106288
you know the incredible faith and how much this meat,0.11003099
and what the church means to people and what you're asking them to give up by acknowledging that these things that we're done,0.07487168
and the movie has the opportunity to go there with Rachel McAdams grandmother a character that is,0.044424623
so underutilized,0.1794311
that you're like well,0.07939039
why was she in this movie if not to make this point,0.10480545
so they could have done it,0.055305194
they could have stressed that and I don't think they do for instance I believe that rachel mcadams grandmother continues to go to church after after this movie and I think that that should have been made more clear then is for the people who discovered the scandal,0.12321827
the movie touches on the importance that the globe the Boston Globe the paper in question suddenly found itself with outsiders,0.117959
in key positions which allow this story to finally come to light Liev Schreiber's editor editor in chief he's playing a terran chief a Jewish individual and a you know who better to be willing to call out the Catholic Church right,0.3507215
Mark Ruffalo's investigative reporter who very much is an outsider you know very bad social skills,0.26610002
etc and also Stanley Tucci's lawyer who you know from you'll see in the film underlines what he feels that he's an outsider okay,0.05147821
and that's what it took to break a story that was covered up by one of the most insider II towns cities in the world Boston and actually they have an insider in the spotlight team played by Michael Keaton's character,0.059589952
and there's a startling discovery that he makes towards the end of the film about his own coverage of this story which I think wasn't spotlighted enough they should have done a better job juxtaposing insiders versus outsiders and i think that it's wonderful to see a movie highlight the importance of outsiders and that they do a lot of work,0.07719832
you know it's the checks the system of checks and balances and without the outsiders you know the insiders can get away with anything,0.07150872
and I think that just to show you how strong a combination faith and insider status can be,0.06645494
that's the exact same thing that happened at Penn State with their molestation scandal with Jerry,0.4323557
Sandusky who was molesting students for 15 years at the school because people had too much financially invested in the football institution of the program,0.19121462
they had a lot emotionally attached to the school,0.08964165
they loved the culture of being part of the school on the sports system the alumni,0.052466247
and also people believed in that it was like the heart of the school the sports program the football team,0.05054341
and they didn't want to blacken it with something that was unfortunately deaf but you know they were willing to let people suffer like this just like what happened with the church,0.3237614
so that just shows you you know how potent and how ugly the combination of faith,0.4381047
and insider status is now with the film itself the craftsmanship of the film,0.056063455
I think as a result of all these things that are missed the directing in the script are weak and Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams just go through the motions,0.12811764
I think their performances are poor,0.2860144
yeah not like embarrassing,0.16813803
but I think it's embarrassing that they didn't do the work,0.10974049
they needed to do all of these people the director of the writer Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams but that doesn't mean this movie is devoid of great performances because the outsiders really do a fantastic job I I've never seen Liev Schreiber so understated it was really cool to watch I've never seen would quite look like this,0.10820975
I thought that the makeover they gave him really did a lot,0.08395874
and he did such a wonderful job with his character Stanley Tucci always of the light but I really liked his performance here there was a seriousness to it that we haven't seen with him in a long time he's usually become a bit of a clown kind of like an arthouse Johnny Depp but he was very very good here,0.44291696
but I thought that the real standout was actually Mark Ruffalo who and all of these gentlemen are doing fantastic character acting but mark ruffalo made such strong character actor choices,0.14760661
and I've never seen him portray a character like this before but yet it was someone I instantly real recognized from you know real life that it was so great to see him bring that character to life on there on the big screen I also want to give a shout out to the actors who played the victims who I think did a fantastic job of portraying people who you can see why they were targeted because of the horrible situations they found themselves in but yet they were a very diverse group but also every one of them seemed like such wonderful people,0.07490574
they pointed out that none of them deserve to have this happen to them and that they were people too people had have been cast aside by the insiders who had too much to lose so finally,0.18387657
in conclusion,0.05190504
spotlight is not a masterfully crafted film it's not even a well-crafted film because of all the things that it fails to do you know to really dive into here,0.07532292
but it's a good enough film,0.09574767
and the story that it depicts is so amazing and so thrilling and all these elements can be taken from the movie if you know you let it sink in then I think it is a hundred and ten percent worth seeing and as a filmed,0.14876758
you know anyone who's interested in filmmaking,0.12027243
I think it's also fascinating to see what the movie misses and how it doesn't go for it far enough and I've actually been hearing,0.086945795
a similar thing about concussion,0.111986406
the concussion has a great story all the tools it needs but it doesn't go far enough,0.10102109
and so I'm nervous but I hope that is not the case there as well so that's my review of spotlight,0.084963314
thank you everybody,0.033536814
thank you,0.039406788
for those of you who insisted I go see this because it's not getting a lot of coverage,0.17628075
people aren't that interested in it but I do think it's worth your time,0.19934568
I look forward to continuing the conversation down below and you can check out some other episodes,0.08702579
