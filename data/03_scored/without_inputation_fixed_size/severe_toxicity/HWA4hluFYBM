hello i am the movie maestro and welcome to this very special movie a lil,0.05364307
as the kampala come on the quality my voice I'm about to make you an,0.06790594
awfully attendant fields this movie is considered by many to be one of the greatest,0.06954029
movies ever made okay I'm not going to do this for the entirety of you,0.07993312
but as you can see I am back in my dark shadowy gritty environment where,0.049874805
I start off doing a vocal impression but in this case it's not going to,0.02736632
be about a horror movie it's going to be about what is essentially just a,0.04254714
dramatic study of a troubled family that happens to be involved in the world of,0.08824858
crime and it just so happens to be one of those movies that many people,0.20572667
consider to be one of the greatest films of all time the film was released,0.031064076
in 1972 under the direction of Francis Ford Coppola with a screenplay by Coppola and,0.0134752905
Maria putzel and of course that movie is the godfather it's kind of hard to,0.22404967
pin down what to say exactly I'm going to film that many consider the greatest,0.10033098
of all time though I will say that personally I thought that it's well worth,0.044933822
the praise it's a fascinating study of people in a difficult situation where it just,0.05060983
happens to be part of their everyday lives and it's surprisingly well paced and the,0.025366113
characters are just so fascinating and even more fascinating still is the fact that it,0.010707461
could easily have been double slow and boring but really it's not especially if this,0.049430463
is the type of movie that many of you might be interested in the story,0.019998081
of the film centers around the Corleone family headed by Don Vito Corleone play by,0.005781111
Marlon Brando however the pivotal character of the film is his son Michael Corleone played,0.012049802
by Al Pacino and one of his first ever film roles and basically the stories,0.025560347
about all the trials and tribulations he goes through as he gradually comes to the,0.032504197
realization that it's his you see to take over his father's role as Godfather in,0.033354968
a family that lives a life crime helping people out and being serviceable and the,0.26696855
great thing about the swim in my opinion is that it's not really a glorification,0.032858077
of the mob or anything speaking against it really it's very very ambivalent in fact,0.02765368
having already seen a couple other films that do a similar thing this one certainly,0.036428116
masters it in almost every respect the characters are all very interesting they make the,0.015881924
film's deliberate pace seem much less deliberate due to that and all of them have,0.056153473
very legitimate virtues and flaws and they balance each other out very well in many,0.022639526
cases it's clear that not all of them are doing things that are good but,0.041811448
not all of them are doing things that are entirely terrible and oddly enough the,0.0548404
film's purpose isn't really to show will decide their own as mentioned before it's largely,0.047838677
ambivalent it's more an observation of a family and more specifically on the difficult acceptance,0.026323978
that a minute early must come to the character of Michael as he develops and,0.038392406
learns about the world he must get used to even though he'd much rather live,0.10040282
a more normal life with his wife played by Diane Keaton and certainly there are,0.059005115
many things about it that worked very well in that respect the atmosphere is also,0.015441573
great this is partial of course held widely superb acting particularly from Brando who in,0.052174345
spite of the fact that you can barely tell what he's even saying because of,0.057987384
his slurred speech still gets a lot across but in addition the atmosphere is well,0.025561012
provided by the very dark gritty cinematography that makes it difficult to focus on things,0.05306835
as well as nino rota's very haunting and very memorable musical score certainly these are,0.02252844
many things that deservedly got academy awards for this film in addition to the best,0.037548285
picture though of course this film is large infamous for Marlon Brando having turned down,0.12116121
his award refusing to accept it on grounds of making a statement for Native Americans,0.037143856
however in spite of that looking at the film on its own there's really too,0.023359254
much to talk about to really narrow it down to a concise review right here,0.044712313
but let me just say it is fascinating if i were to talk about what,0.024660353
makes it so fascinating this would go on for an eternity but let's just say,0.056305137
that there are lots of characters with interesting things to grasp i guess the one,0.02423397
flaw that i can point to this film is that there are maybe a couple,0.025073431
characters that could use a little bit more of an exploration but to be fair,0.017139787
they are particularly important figures in Michael's life and this is essentially Michael story so,0.016306313
I suppose I can forgive that and certainly I really admire the way it observes,0.043407224
the mob partially because the mob itself was very concerned about how this film would,0.04639789
be pulled off and therefore there were several members around to look over things and,0.048956186
another thing that I wished I saw more of though were the services to the,0.03217826
certain people the way the film opens is very bizarre and yet so effective it's,0.028928172
simply an interview from someone trying to make justice for the attempted rape of his,0.35987878
daughter and that it's revealed he is speaking to Don Corleone and the way it,0.049810283
shot is unbelievable it's a great way to open things off and the fact that,0.28640583
Marlon Brando's character Vito Corleone is willing to do services in spite of the situation,0.027974298
for many people in dire situations where nothing else can help is surprisingly touching it's,0.053738855
kind of hard to imagine that it would be but in fact it largely is,0.016600324
people praised the Godfather like crazy but really that praise is very very merited for,0.11322091
something that on the surface wouldn't seem interesting it's in fact a very very interesting,0.04454868
film and I really doubt that anybody wouldn't appreciate something out of it the acting,0.035816815
writing the pay sing the music the cinematography the atmosphere it's all very very well,0.028155228
done and to a very surprising degree Francis Ford Coppola of course became an overnight,0.07351609
sensation due to this film and well deserved he's made several other pretty well thought-out,0.103737384
films since maybe none that quite reached the level of this as well as its,0.03279688
popular sequel which I'm sure we'll get to later but for sure The Godfather is,0.011984614
well worth seeing on the worth meter this gets the distinction of an ultimate recommendation,0.045322955
whether you altima tlie will admire this film or not definitely check it out though,0.04386088
they're definitely going to be maybe a few things that you're likely to admire so,0.008807031
out of 5 stars this is a 5 out of 5 thank you for your,0.028920189
