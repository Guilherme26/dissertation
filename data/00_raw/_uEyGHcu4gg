well buddy you a fan Z here today's review is going to be for the 1952 movie musical singing in the rain starring Gene Kelly Donald O'Connor and Julie Andrews now going into this movie I am a fan of musicals and I had heard a lot of good things about this movie and how I was in classic now overall it's a good movie but it's not a great movie now definitely the three main actors are the best reason to watch this I thought Gene Kelly was good Julie Andrews was good but I felt like my standout was Donnell O'Connor as Cosmo Brown I just felt like any time he was on screen eight elevated the movie a little bit more maybe more interested and I thought the story was good it was definitely easy to follow along with now on to the negatives even though Julie Andrews was good I just felt like she could have done a little bit more and another big problem of mine is that the even though the movie to a lot of people it's considered classic to me it just isn't very memorable and it's not a movie that I would really watch that many more times and it's just yeah there's just nothing very remarkable in the story it seemed just like you knew where it was going and all that overall I'm going to give this a three and a half out of five well that is my review for the [Music] 19:52 would be musical singing in the ring this is move fans e signing off have a good night
