"Hello and welcome to the Flick advisory today, we're going to review Logan"
"Now, Logan is directed by James Mangold, Logan is said to be the final portrayal of the character Wolverine by Hugh Jackman"
This is the ninth time he's played the character
I'm starting with
"2000s, X-men Action was really the first time at least 20 Century Fox kind of took the comic book movie seriously, X-men kind of redefine the comic book genre"
They're the first ones who really put a lot into the comic book movies
I've seen
They could actually be more than just silly comic book movies
"If you go back to that first X-men that I protection, actually touched a lot about the political and social issues"
I'm all being under the veil of mutants versus people
But the whole movie is really a civil rights movie
"You know, if you think about civil rights communes, So starring Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart returns as Professor X, Xavier, and introducing Daphne Keen as Laura"
"I'm also knows X-23 Hey, why not Okay, X-23 is a clone of Wolverine That they got wrong 22 times"
"Then they decided to try to make it a female you know, playing around the chromosomes and filing the 23rd attempt to make a Wolverine clone"
It works
"Oh, I can't much like you know"
One of the things you want to take note is that this movie is loosely based off of the the comic book Old Man Logan
It's loosely based because there are elements that the movie can't take away from the soy
And then the elements of the movie doesn't take away from that particular story
That story has the all the Marvel now all of a model
But that story has Marvel elements and Marvel properties that 20 accessory box cannot use
Such as the whole Hawkeye
"Those things belong to Marvel Studios, you know, in their original series and stuff like that"
"And so 20th Century Fox took the Old man Logan feel, and adapted it into a story that they could actually use with their properties"
"I'm so you know, there is no Wolverine finding the hoax"
"You know, children, those things don't happen in this, sir"
"there's no blind Hawkeye driving Wolverine around, So in that sense, is there an immediate adaptation of old man Logan? It's more of a rethinking, or loosely based off of that"
So here you have Logan
He's an old man
He's an old man you know
Imagine you know Charles Xavier
now a really old man
"This matter of fact, he's kind of going see now"
he's got dementia or Alzheimer's
He has a degenerative
"You know, the kind of brain disease here and Logan is taking care of him"
They have so like a father-son relationship
Almost all the other X-men are gone
They kind of a little to a reason about why that's happening
We'll get into that later
So it's really just Xavier and Logan full of full majority
The movie Until Lower comes along
Laura needs help getting to this other place with these other kind of upcoming
mutants are like a safe haven for them
Anytime you are
Come on
"come on, everyone has come along now"
A lot of the things in this move
We work really really well as talk about those things
"The direction in this movie, the tone they decide to take"
This is a this be first rated our X-men movie
"Are you can say Deadpool if you want through, Dipple is a raid on comic book movie And he is kind of an excellent"
"Your Honor, me, but this is actually something that we've been waiting for for a long time"
It was nice to see Wolverine on the screen Back in two thousand
It was just It was just a neat thing and it has been cool ever since
But you kind of wanted a little bit more
You kind of want of the edginess of that particular character to really come through
And they tried it a little bit before
"with 2013, The Wolverine with James Mangold, also directed"
"It tries to bring you a more ground in a more serious, a more mature Wolverine character, and, after the release of Deadpool which was rated R, 20 Century Fox decided they could take a chance and tell a more mature adult Wolverine story, And so here they had to take that and run with it at a rated R level"
And for that the movie doesn't hold back And let me give you everything you something
we've been waiting to see
You know for the last what 17 years you know
"When Wolverine you know, stab somebody"
You're selected that somebody with this cause you know
Finally actual blood comes out
"Hey, you know, it's not that clean clip"
They clean cut album
You know what would you slice it? You cut all right of the wound At the exact same time we got to a point where I was almost like insulting our intelligence
So we finally get the blood on this and another thing
This movie just hurts
There's movie physically and emotionally hurts
They bring you along with these characters
"You know, you've already known"
you know Wolverine Logan
you already know Professor Extra
Now you get to really spend a lot of time with them because it's mostly them before the other X-men movie
"Here, you're sharing screen time with Real Storm, Jean Grey"
"Rogue, You know Cyclops"
"Do you know all these other characters? Finally we get to sit down with really the characters we've enjoyed the most, and to spend time with them and fill for them and let them take you along the ride"
"If some, when bad things happen to them, and there's allows bad things that haven't told in this movie"
"When bad things happen to him, you'd get there and it hurts you"
"It is sort of an emotionally draining movie, almost like I said with my Princess review, as even as a movie you're just high"
You need somebody to help you out of the seat because you're exhausted and it's a good thing
I mean it's effective storytelling
It's good acting
It's a good direction
I was good writing Hugh Jackman against us as well
"He's got to know this role by the bathroom, you know, like the back of his hand by"
"At this point you know, Plane is character nine different times, but he actually brings it to a whole nother level this time because Wolverines out of place in his life that he hasn't been before"
There's no more glitz and glamour
There's no more team
"Even though he wasn't the biggest team players, There's no real team to fall back on"
"None of that is, Just hear my professor actually trying to take care of them and Professor X, you know Charles Xavier, and you know Patrick Stewart"
"Playing him again, gives another outstanding performance"
"Um, He's an old man even-even, older man"
he's beginning to go see now
"So, but you know somebody who hazards of you know, uh, who's going through this"
You understand what a bad day is for them
"You know they don't remember You were you trying to tell them? Hey, you know this happened back in the day"
They're like
"I'll remember that, but no, when Charles Xavier has a bad day, you know with the mind that he has"
"When that mine such a deteriorate, it's not just a bad day for him"
That's a bad day for everybody in like a five-mile radius
When I try to think about things that don't work in this movie
"I, really, I, nothing really comes across"
"You would think maybe the thing you know, the child actor Daphne King, you'll think maybe you know sushi or the one below, and the movie she works really well"
She gives things across a lot of times without dialogue
You do believe her as this savage now know now you know somebody confronts her
"You're kind of expecting they might have something for her, but nah, nah, you know, when she goes off, she goes off and then Wolverine almost almost have to catch up to her, you know, because you know it's his movie too, so no, she absolutely does a great job as well"
I really had a tough time thinking anything bad about this movie In any kind of points to Dr
"Down, and really the only thing I have"
I have two things
I kind of wish they had
"They wish they had expounded upon one and movies, Wolverine sick, You know, he's not healing"
I wish
they kind of told you hate
This is what's wrong with them
This is like not healing
This is returning them
But they take the mature they make
they take the more mature
"Well, you know, you know, it gives full out of Schilling, and they kind of allude to it and they say, Hey, take that for what it is and run with it, and also what happens to the rest of the accident"
"You know, in the movie it's Caliban, Wolverine and Professor X, and there's no other mutants, Really the Speaker, And you wonder what will happen to the other Mutants, Weapon to the X-men Once again, they allude to it"
They tell you how you know
Just this is probably what happened here
"but we're not saying it definite when I'm saying in indefinite terms, I, again at the moment shear out"
"I, Understanding your audience is talking about all the time you know, like things you know, spoon-fed to you"
"I kind of wished they have spoon fed me this one, but I can live with it"
It's the more mature around
It's good storytelling
I get it because this movie is essentially 17 years of the making
I have to give it a night out of 10
This is something we've been waiting for for a long long time
They finally delivered it to us in a near perfect package
"It's like when we first seen the Spider-man in In Civil wars, Like this is what we've been waiting for"
And so that's why Spider-man stole that show
We learn that whole movie
This Logan is what we've been waiting with
"You know, excellent fan comic book fans have been waiting for for a long time, and they gave it to us, and uh, nicely wrapped bowl"
"So what do you think of Logan? Do you think maybe it was too sad? You think those two series for a comic book movie? Do you believe that this has to do with Deadpool success? Let me know in the comments, please hit the like button"

"I took a quick break because I have some dental work, so I didn't really feel comfortable talking on the camera while it was hurting"
I want to get into it away
