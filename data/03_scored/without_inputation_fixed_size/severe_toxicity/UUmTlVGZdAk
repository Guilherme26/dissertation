singing in the rain so singing in the rain came out in 1952 and has,0.025451256
gathered quite the reputation as being the best movie musical ever made and while i,0.031268287
wouldn't say it's the best it is pretty close singing that rain is just one,0.019928237
of those musicals where every time i watch it i'm blown away by the sheer,0.10125559
amount of talent on and off the screen and it proves that jukebox musicals don't,0.032401096
have to be bad they just most of the time are now for those of,0.04981494
you don't know jukebox musical is a musical where none of the songs are original,0.033459403
they're pre-existing and how it usually goes is that they take a playlist of songs,0.09478468
and then have to retrofit in a story to try to connect them and nine,0.022307599
times out of ten it doesn't work but singing in the rain is the one,0.030445455
time but what is singing in the rain about well it focuses on a period,0.02098455
in history that doesn't often get talked about and that's when hollywood had to transition,0.016875044
from silent cinema to the talkies and that monumental year was 1927 with the jazz,0.009013903
singer the first movie to ever have synchronized dialogue even if it was just for,0.022517797
the musical numbers but more specifically this story focuses on don lockwood played by gene,0.028201126
kelly and he's this silent action hero douglas fairbanks type and it's kind of funny,0.059135493
he's playing this type of character here because ever since i saw gene kelly in,0.038807478
the three musketeers movie i always lumped him in with actors like errol flynn and,0.094578475
tyrone power as these kind of swashbuckling adventurers not knowing of course that he's also,0.07027732
one of the best tap dancers of all time but it's still funny seeing him,0.024895163
play this douglas fairbanks errol flynn type character in singing in the rain and this,0.02952085
is gene kelly's movie through and through he helped direct it he choreographed it and,0.03691636
he is the star of this movie and all of his talents are on full,0.029727057
display here his singing his acting and especially his dancing i'm not exaggerating when i,0.13124739
say that this movie has some of the best tap dancing segments ever put to,0.035536107
film but gene kelly's don lockwood does not carry this movie alone he's also accompanied,0.05009897
with his best friend cosmo brown played by donald o'connor and not only is he,0.10523671
talented enough to hang with gene kelly's choreography he's also the perfect comic for gene,0.35166106
kelly's straight man but their lives are not all sunshine and roses because you've also,0.15240355
got lena lamont played by gene hagen and she is the thorn in the side,0.29530928
of don lockwood this whole movie because she's convinced that she's a lot more talented,0.08164797
than she actually is and doesn't think that her voice is the most annoying thing,0.22484183
on earth for heaven's sake what's the big idea can a girl get a word,0.11500028
in edgewise and what really gets under lockwood's skin is the fact that she's convinced,0.04952093
that he's in love with her and wants to marry her because according to cosmo,0.083305605
she's irresistible she told him so herself but where the plot really gets going is,0.046757087
when don lockwood meets kathy selden played by debbie reynolds and she's an aspiring actress,0.100338295
she wants to go on broadway and she doesn't think too highly of movie actors,0.08074664
but naturally a romance sparks between kathy and don and that of course makes lena,0.026355907
jealous i know that's kind of a bare bones plot but where this movie really,0.066247635
excels is one the musical numbers which i'm gonna get to and two how they,0.04920962
tell this other story at the same time of hollywood adapting to this new innovation,0.03684319
called synchronized sound and it's a secondary story that makes singing in the rain so,0.013398129
entertaining as a movie from the very beginning you get the vibe that this movie,0.019149972
doesn't try to accurately depict the 1920s as it was but more of a caricature,0.037886865
of how it felt to be in the 1920s while at the same time poking,0.02967983
fun at all the hypocrisy and just how fake hollywood culture was and still is,0.24682194
and while the clothing and the personalities and the reactions are all very much exaggerated,0.025780523
the motivations are surprisingly authentic you get a good feel of the hesitancy and then,0.0304255
later frustration in trying to use this new talking picture technology and as someone who,0.047909185
loves history especially film history this is all really cool to see but now let's,0.02449805
talk about the part of this movie that actually matters and why it got made,0.016290348
in the first place the musical numbers these musical numbers do not disappoint and the,0.025063455
first big musical number that we get is make them laugh now make them laugh,0.03569176
is important for a couple reasons first of all it's the first non-diegetic song that,0.2530834
we get in this movie being a jukebox musical they usually make most if not,0.037429884
all of the songs non-diegetic i mean just look at mamma mia most of that,0.24074766
movie is just people busting out into song and dance just because they feel like,0.037334763
it but seeing the rain takes a different approach for instance the first few songs,0.013521853
that we get in singing in the rain are diegetic there are performances within the,0.1563248
world that people are reacting to as if they were watching a show and this,0.03671082
makes make them laugh special because it's the first time in this movie where we,0.05725435
see someone break out into song and dance and it's not a paid performance but,0.054519784
the other thing that makes make him laugh special is that it's one of only,0.039055593
two songs that were made specifically for this movie which might disqualify this as a,0.029689807
jukebox musical but make him laugh is so similar to be a clown from the,0.26315856
pirate that i still consider it basically a pre-existing work just one that's copyright friendly,0.12974142
and who can't talk about make him laugh without talking about the a-plus slapstick from,0.19959168
donald o'connor make him laugh as a master class in slapstick all the gags are,0.2954649
there you got pratfalls you haven't getting hit in the head you have pretty much,0.3529385
every form of physical comedy that you can imagine in this one number and it,0.044691693
is fantastic now the next song is you were meant for me and this is,0.022971451
the big love ballad between don lockwood and kathy selden and it's romantic and it's,0.067584656
slow and it's dreamy and everything and it's good but this is where trying to,0.036645632
tell which songs are diegetic and which songs aren't is becoming a little more difficult,0.09726315
because in this song and while i'm thinking about it all the numbers in this,0.04621696
movie are performed by characters who in the world know how to sing and dance,0.033672262
so it's not that big of a stretch when someone just starts expressing themselves in,0.035703067
song and dance when that character is established to be able to sing and dance,0.018466828
and if you need any more proof just look at lena lamont she can't sing,0.04441631
can't dance and she gets zero song and dance numbers in this whole movie so,0.03211573
following that logic i guess you could kind of classify all of these numbers as,0.033445433
diegetic that they do exist in this movie even make them laugh but i still,0.59303397
call them nondiegetic because there's no official established source of the music where it's coming,0.08480493
from so i guess that's where i would draw the line but i don't know,0.038222782
comment below do you think that all the songs in this musical are diegetic and,0.22375369
where do you draw the line let me know but moving on to the next,0.016199883
big number we have my favorite song in the movie and this is the second,0.023785638
and final song written originally for this movie and it's moses supposes and don't ask,0.032309964
me why this is my favorite i have no idea it just really made me,0.024321774
laugh as a kid and still makes me laugh today i just love seeing this,0.06414699
proper british dialect coach just get wrecked by the antics of cosmo and don and,0.24432553
just like all the other numbers in this movie the tap dancing here is insane,0.16636044
it's so fast and with so much energy and man i just i wish i,0.05784703
was that talented and speaking of insane choreography we then go on to good morning,0.04444225
which this is the number where debbie reynold has to hang with the big boys,0.28845993
and she's gone on record saying that she has no dancing experience and she was,0.04763513
basically starting from scratch when the rehearsal started how how can she nail this crazy,0.24495798
choreography with zero experience she found a new talent i guess i mean between her,0.09625274
and dick van dyke maybe more actors should just be thrown into crazy choreography and,0.75148094
see what happens you might get some really good dancers out of it but i,0.055849485
guess it can't be that hard to keep up when you're dressed like quicksilver from,0.07023341
x-men but now we have the big finale climactic musical number broadway melody this is,0.049526915
the one where they threw all the money all the budget all the choreography all,0.04212741
the effects and it makes absolutely no sense and it's actually my least favorite number,0.04917503
in the movie i know a lot of people like it and it is impressive,0.06979639
from a technical perspective but let me explain the whole rest of this movie is,0.016333584
so grounded in the world of the 1920s that it's created for itself and like,0.023951268
i explained earlier with diagesis it doesn't force you to suspend your disbelief so much,0.086106695
because all the characters are actors and dancers and performers so when they perform in,0.014468409
a musical number it's not that weird but all that goes out the window with,0.03584076
broadway melody i know that in the context of the story it's framed where don,0.03706137
lockwood is explaining the broadway melody segment to the producer because that's going to be,0.016303651
the big opening for the movie that they're trying to make within the movie but,0.025359461
even that doesn't really hold up to scrutiny because what we know of the movie,0.009259356
the dancing cavalier so far it doesn't line up to what we're seeing in this,0.037998617
segment sure it starts off similar enough you have a young hoofer who's looking to,0.12835716
star in a broadway show and everything and he's got big dreams but that's really,0.054762576
where it ends we don't see the sandbag hit him on the head we don't,0.4794025
even really see him star in a broadway show we just see this guy get,0.05929447
picked up by an agent and then montage through him you know getting higher up,0.058038604
in the ranks of broadway and then it takes a turn to the speakeasy and,0.03749241
gangsters and gangster life and this woman played by cerise who might be a wizard,0.4171348
of oz type parallel to lena lamont and i don't know it doesn't line up,0.023927322
all that well and it just feels like an excuse to have gene kelly do,0.0508034
his gene kelly thing for 15 to 20 minutes which is way too long by,0.07805864
the way and pardon me feels bad ragging on this segment because it is really,0.039820556
impressive the sets look really cool the coloring the lighting the dancing and choreography it's,0.04527373
all really impressive and looks great but it does nothing to further the rest of,0.016916286
the story which i guess wouldn't hurt so much if i wasn't so invested in,0.022121347
this 1920s drama that was going on because again i love hollywood history but even,0.04382496
so singing and reign is a fantastic musical and it is a testament to what,0.030594457
jukebox musicals can be if they really tried the dancing is incredible the camera work,0.051435325
is great it's shot in long takes where you really get a sense of the,0.2632555
choreography that's on display and all of the actors do a phenomenal job with the,0.03137871
roles that they're given singing and reign is just a classic movie musical that should,0.025010904
be watched time and time again if you've never watched it check it out if,0.036480665
you haven't seen in a while watch it again it's well worth the time but,0.027769422
now i turn over to you guys where do you draw the line of what,0.058358558
is diegetic versus non-diegetic and singing in the rain how much of it is in,0.283004
universe or just for the audience's benefit i don't know but i'd love to hear,0.0319654
