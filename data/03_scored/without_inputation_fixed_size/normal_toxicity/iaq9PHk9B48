trailers before seeing films especially this trailer it's been everywhere so I've been trying to,0.09001414
look the other way every time it's on TV but from what we can tell,0.05127176
a quiet place is about a family that are in a secluded place it seems,0.098850116
like it's out in the woods and they can't make any noise otherwise something will,0.07888335
come and get them that's all I know about the film's storyline what we do,0.05213352
know is it is directed and starred John Quin ciske who's actually married to Emily,0.1200787
Blunt who is in the film as well the story is apparently Emily encouraged Krinsky,0.07100791
to direct the film after reading the first draft of the script and then also,0.020085422
asked if she could start opposite him in the film also apparently the original screenplay,0.070616946
only had one sentence of dialogue so this will be really interesting going into the,0.056166917
film and seeing how much dialogue there is another really interesting and exciting thing about,0.06336345
this film is that the original script was actually named one of the best scripts,0.056223728
of the year I think it was top 10 in 2017 by the tracking boards,0.056528427
2017 hit list so I'm super excited to see how it works I hope there's,0.11517507

hives let's go hi guys we just finished watching a quiet place and the film,0.13717626
was great Dean actually even liked it himself you thought it was quite good yeah,0.09171569
yeah it was better than I thought it was gonna be yes and that's great,0.0741133
because that's exactly what we wanted to hear from like a non horror lover just,0.11794809
to be clear guys this is not gonna have any spoilers at all just because,0.099800505
I know a lot of you guys won't see this til next week and I,0.08822653
just kind of want to give you my shorthand review talking about technique acting and,0.12960064
structure not really the content of the film the story though is about what I,0.06465667
thought it was about that's as much as I'll say the tension in the film,0.064078964
was amazing and I think that that was definitely made by the actors Emily Blunt,0.078727186
was like such a standout for me the situations that they get into his dire,0.24180867
and is in saying as I said before earlier that there wasn't gonna be much,0.06417265
talking in the film that is definitely correct and it was such a good film,0.029226873
to see in the cinema because of that although you got to be careful what,0.06843368
session you go to because I could imagine if someone was talking or you've been,0.154913
eating something loudly the guys on their phone yeah there was a guy in front,0.15321036
of me he was on he's fine but I guess the light wasn't as bad,0.14997725
as I think the sound would have been to affect the situation and the feel,0.05610995
of the film there was a guy next to me eating popcorn and it definitely,0.07272354
took me out a couple of times but the film was such like a simple,0.121073306
kind of story and all of the actors and characters were really straightforward definitely because,0.03556164
the sound design of the film was such a huge aspect of the film they,0.048310798
really played with it and they brought in some music and then they also had,0.050114732
like a lot of like highs and lows and it definitely kept you on the,0.08362385
edge of your seat but the main thing for me was just it was a,0.11279896
straightforward story but the tension was just done so well I just thought it was,0.04458728
amazing I think those are good balance cuz normally for those high tension movies if,0.090774715
you sit through them for too long even if they're gripping the whole time you,0.2245802
feel exhausted like having anxiety for the entire movie right and you're just exhaust at,0.10418116
the end of it so it wasn't like that but at the same time it,0.07632476
wasn't like I felt quite short even though it was it was very kind of,0.12947597
movie yeah it was a very concise storyline that is quite heartbreaking at points and,0.05807888
very straight forward but it just definitely yeah you hold some tension and you throughout,0.10675305
the whole time and wow I feel like Emily Blunt was just such a standout,0.068815514
for me I don't know if you felt the same I thought she was amazing,0.20358609
this movie and I I've seen her in a lot of movies but I never,0.108246535
thought much of her this film like she was amazing they know anything was that,0.1854984
they showed the trailer before yeah but I watched a bit of the trailer which,0.057474434
I know that you tried not to it actually I thought it gave away the,0.15459688
movie and then when I watch the movie it didn't so if you feel like,0.061940838
you've watched the trailer and it's giving away the movie you don't have to worry,0.1355471
that it hasn't actually I guess all in all I want to say definitely check,0.041312765
this one out the cinema I'm sure you guys already were but it gets our,0.07655028
thumbs up if you want me to talk about this in more detail i real,0.08939899
I'm really just trying not to ruin it for any of you guys but thumbs,0.28366593
up the film was beautiful obviously the sound mix was amazing but the emotion of,0.08099734
the characters are really what pulled it through for me I'm gonna give this one,0.08423928
an 8 out of 10 I thought it was an amazing film scare school I'm,0.15081698
gonna give it a 7 just because of the tension it was just the stress,0.043862775
levels during that film was like insane Andra jolly I'm gonna give it like a,0.22800079
it's like a 6 or 7 maybe like a and I'll give it a 7,0.073366635
I'd say it's about a 6 for me really yeah I thought you liked it,0.08036602
yeah that but man you have different right I don't like about something it's under,0.18400158
50% okay I think that if you do want to take somebody who is scared,0.3027632
of horror films Dean can say it's not the scariest horror film you've definitely seen,0.18472444
it was more attention I'd recommend if you don't like our eyes show them that,0.24121358
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this please let me know if you want a,0.099139325
more in-depth kind of review because I'm happy to do that I'm just really conscious,0.06300519
