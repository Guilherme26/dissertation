see the fact that this whoa is that the first time i'm hearing this with,0.10854197
headphones so that noise just zipped through my left ear that was insane that was,0.28635177
wild i don't know like that was that that spooked me a little bit yo,0.46367437
yo yo what's up everybody welcome back to another movie reaction and commentary today we're,0.0728503
going to be re-watching arrival now i'm really excited to kind of jump into this,0.24217917
one because it's been a minute since i've watched this to the point where i,0.07006831
kind of forget the main theme of this i know it has something to do,0.056356598
with aliens and like communication but i know there's like a twist at the end,0.091674134
that you know i think implements time travel or something like that um but yeah,0.10296869
i just remember being like really blown away primarily due to the cinematography as well,0.12257696
as just the direction that this movie decided to take and i'm really excited to,0.063791506
kind of rewatch that and provide some filmmaking aspects to things uh that can hopefully,0.08720736
bring value to you guys and also maybe clarify some things that maybe you hadn't,0.09560867
realized the first time or second time or however many times you've watched this film,0.10197819
so i'm really excited to kind of do this this is also starring amy adams,0.10412449
forest whitaker and jeremy renner um and we got the man the myth the legend,0.08823906
dennis the villain i'm not gonna call that i'm not gonna say his last day,0.24188411
because i know i'm a butch it up even though i know how to say,0.25415042
it i'm just not gonna even attempt it because knowing me i might butcher it,0.5154597
but on here we're gonna call him dennis the villain because he's villainous with the,0.20323452
camera and this dude knows how to direct movies he's just been killing it ever,0.711131
since i you know watched prisoners on here i'm really excited for i believe he's,0.14956586
doing dune as well too um blade runner 2049 was just incredible yeah i mean,0.18608034
he's he's on a roll in terms of just directing these incredible really deeply layered,0.09836752
films that you know encompass not only filmmaking and why filmmaking is great but also,0.13595311
it does justice to the overall story that he's presenting to the audience in general,0.05536622
and i think that's a perfect balance so i'm excited to kind of jump into,0.15858135
this when i kind of re-watch this and from the eyes of a filmmaker now,0.08890645
and just really just like you know be able to uh sit down and hopefully,0.2437127
bring some education to things that maybe you haven't known about like always guys the,0.08252444
best way to support the channel is through patreon but i get it now everybody,0.06585188

help out the channel just as much as well as let's say for instance you,0.08337512
don't have a sign in account you can just sit back relax and the best,0.108422965
thing you can do for yourself and for me is to just enjoy your time,0.10425891
as we watch or i should say re-watch arrival again guys if you want to,0.08913328
watch the full length definitely check out the patreon link below there you can sync,0.070049524
up your copy of the film with mine and enjoy all the commentary and laughs,0.10003517
and whatever the heck is in the freaking video that i don't put on youtube,0.7093121
you guys already know the drill yeah this scene hurts a lot because of knowing,0.11658158
the scene definitely holds new meaning now if i can remember correctly on uh what,0.042793956
exactly happened at the end of this film but also this is a kick-ass soundtrack,0.65149176
i've heard it multiple times too bad i can't play it for y'all but just,0.08223573
know it's like the it's like the sad soundtrack you guys know what it is,0.09847337
yeah again guys you know i would i mean this is definitely sci-fi i would,0.07857629
say in its own way you know storytelling is there are days that define yours,0.04342816
millions and trillions of ways to formulate a story so i would consider this sci-fi,0.23035008
but very psychological i love the the tackle of you know inner questions and things,0.14939417
or themes that you know really depend on the independent and how they affect the,0.03767822
outside world basically imagine this film being like imploding in on itself and then exploding,0.21224475
hold on i'm learning that more objects like this have landed ah it's so great,0.25856265
that they're keeping this frame on her face as the information is being told to,0.10429359
us without showing us what it is like that's so well done that's so well,0.11830091
done builds a lot of questions and it also builds this narrative it's really cool,0.04737232
i really relate to dennis and his way of you know storytelling because it's some,0.049294647
of the things that i would do the only ones to have one of these,0.12054779
in our backyard if this is some sort of peaceful first contact another thing too,0.13637051
that i really appreciate is the flow of information within this film i'm noticing it,0.081552655
now but just the audio uh that's outside of like you know our main source,0.06466301
here you know the dialogue is being almost transitional it's like a transition phase to,0.06591789
every scene so even though the scenes are changing the flow of information still keeps,0.10112223
the same pace which allows us to you know really piece together what the director,0.04489482
or you know the filmmaker wants us to know lady ain't nobody showing up the,0.069549665
class like there's aliens coming to earth no one is showing up to class you're,0.1783632
always going to have teachers like that it's the weirdest thing to me go home,0.11630841
like can you imagine someone coming into your your your workspace and saying can you,0.56850135
translate that and then proceed to like let you hear that it's like i i,0.06197995
don't even know where to start with that i don't even know what to even,0.19012633
begin with that tonight as russia and china join talks at the united nations meanwhile,0.1229442
financial markets across the world are in crisis as the dow jones industrial outlet if,0.05349553
any of you notice too there's a lot of blue like like the color blue,0.040557265
just literally radiating the film itself why i'm not too sure but i would love,0.07198437
to understand why blue seems to dominate a lot of the shot selections get here,0.10580624
are they capable faster than my travel i think you might have a i love,0.09261998
how realistic this film is man this film is just so damn realistic in its,0.65735
approach and how they decided to tackle this i would have loved to seen like,0.09676565
the conversation of tackling this film as realistic as possible i wonder if they talked,0.06887882
with anybody god what the hell man that shot is crazy dude with this music,0.72649974
in the background just damn it's so good it's so good i love it like,0.5154597
this is my speed to a t that sense of scale is wild wild what,0.21809873
a crazy cool way to just introduce that oval-shaped spaceship man i really love that,0.27225786
it's just super cloudy which is like the greatest thing at least for like uh,0.15029699
a cinematographer [Laughter] like just the the atmosphere the vibe that's weight down in a,0.07307987
lot of these shots because of just how it looks like i'm telling you guys,0.24056157
like the look of your film can really affect the story of your film every,0.14840001
aspect of filmmaking is important and that's why i tell you the best thing that,0.07553854
you could do as a filmmaker or anybody that's dealing with any piece of art,0.19798437
is to know the vibe that you want to cast not only for your audience,0.09823141
but for yourself yeah bro that sense of scale is just ridiculous it's one of,0.7093121
the reasons why i'm also really excited for dune too because that sense of scale,0.15265901
man like the scale is what is one of my favorites within this film like,0.15128338
just looking up and seeing this fortress of an identified floating object that's not from,0.0749072
our galaxy really that is wild that's crazy that's that's insane that's insane dawg that,0.5053359
sound is wild i don't even know how they did that doctor nlgger nlgger dude,0.7444969
like what they literally look like their hands are doing this bro like that's like,0.12538767
dude that's so cool like that's incredible man shout out to everyone who worked on,0.19763371
this film this is just such a surreal moment i don't know about y'all i,0.13910823
get a marine biologist in the building like this this sounds like wells communicating with,0.058536235
each other or some deep-sea creature communicating with each other they're using like vibrations like,0.15302832
that's wild set their compound ablaze their website claims the arrival of the aliens set,0.11362364
in motion of prophecy the 12 sets and it's not even just a race against,0.24044771
time for the aliens it's a race against time for like the people of the,0.40309748
world because we're just freaking out you know like everybody's freaking out because they don't,0.40309727
know what the heck is happening so the reason why i'm assuming that the military,0.47069794
is like hey we need to do this fast it's because everything is gonna you,0.09715864
know everything is just gonna fall apart bro that is so cool man that is,0.19124863
so cool man help me understand okay um i gotta say i'm so frustrated with,0.15531187
forrest whitaker's forrest whitaker's like questions but like i'm happy he is questioning it so,0.12519673
that way i can learn too but he is frustrating my thing is like you,0.32804087
can't see the top of their bodies like it's it's forever in mystery you don't,0.1025532
exactly know how big they are or what the finished product of their body even,0.17130673
looks like they're like weird octopus that are blind it's really strange and i love,0.1549096
it that is wild man i love that that's so cool bro that's so cool,0.24206544
damn i love sci-fi man it's so dope see the fact that this whoa it's,0.7679939
like the first time i'm hearing this with headphones so that noise just zipped through,0.07633571
my left ear that was insane that was wild i don't know like that was,0.25328103
that that spooked me a little bit unlike all written humanly it's like teaching an,0.15350012
infant the dictionary through painting that's literally what it is i only say infant because,0.19163859
you know they don't know the language so imagine trying to teach an infant the,0.23926738
human dictionary through like i don't know pollock paintings you would have to know each,0.403803
word you wanted to use as well as how much space that it would occupy,0.088305876
such a brilliant a brilliant way to tell that like that's just so good what's,0.05733082
this word yeah i if you were to tell me that there would be a,0.10652363
correlation between a grieving mother who's lost their child and extraterrestrial aliens i'd be like,0.3161798
okay it's just it's incredible that it makes sense off her weapon wow oh god,0.32798985
god that's ah yeah that would definitely bring some uh some tension action prevails there's,0.08767422
no evidence of that sure there is let's grab a history book the british with,0.11797302
india the germans with rwanda yeah but that's human like that's human that's so weird,0.48277935
to bring up history when you're dealing with aliens especially when you don't know what,0.17967652
they are and their communication is vastly different that's the one thing man that it,0.06396905
frustrated me when i first watched this is people's just like oh yeah well history,0.15122493
it's only been humans it's human history like what and there would be idiots like,0.8606264
this there will be idiots like this just stupid dumb not know how to do,0.9185368
their job idiots oh god that's so annoying oh snap i think it's tapping it,0.92007893
because it's like yo there is a bomb in our ship brett go get that,0.28010115
thing it's like hey so like i know all over time dimension there's a bomb,0.30924365
in our ship you should get that damn i think this was when it clicked,0.8060606
for me when i first watched it i was like oh yeah these dudes are,0.14902638
like other dimension like they know how to like what with uh ian said being,0.103216924
able to know a beginning and middle a beginning and ending of a sentence is,0.10279145
basically that but just with time wow dude i can't believe i don't remember this,0.070741236
part what the heck that's crazy yo said the aliens have 24 hours to leave,0.59731305
chinese territory or face destruction and he urged all other world i hate how like,0.6051216
realistic how realistic this would be like it's so stupid it's so stupid man i'm,0.8606264
just like why don't you just let people do their jobs i don't know but,0.1510099
like whatever stop focusing on the ones look at the zeros how much of this,0.095158376
is data how much of it is negative space yup and this is where the,0.06870576
dimensions come in man they're in a whole different dimension speaking in 5d basically they,0.105678976
are speaking in five-dimensional i don't even know what that looked like so i don't,0.086842515
even know what how that even would i can't even fathom that what trade it's,0.07695244
a non-zero sum game non-zero sum game oh my god everything is freaking connected bro,0.5216169
what yo it's ah dude time and sci-fi there's so much out there that's just,0.083422154
so interesting to me i'm so happy this film exists i've never seen anything like,0.081711285
it i'm not sure if it was like originally a book or whatnot but so,0.052250236
interesting yeah at that point it's it's destined to be her like you just know,0.16355444
that it's destined to be heard this is so bizarre man i love it god,0.18656428
that is just so awesome man just so many questions are just in my brain,0.1952148
right now so many visually how do you capture something like this you know like,0.083606936
man the visuals in this are just beyond anything yo yo that's that's that's i,0.24263068
can't fathom that how do they design that oh that's so intriguing this is so,0.065891996
cool man this is so dope [Laughter] oh yeah i mean i'll be i'd be,0.35228541
crapping my pants tremendously though who's this child yep and then that's where it clicks,0.6557687
she didn't even have a kid yet right imagine imagine trying to put that and,0.15433232
wrap it around your stupid three-dimensional human mind like how do how does one do,0.896797
that how does one do that it's my fault i told him something that he,0.15766957
wasn't ready to hear oh it clicks now i unders i i'm getting where i,0.10858999
left off from when i first watched this yeah got you that's why he left,0.10890246
it's ian by the way she basically was like hey dude um our tartar is,0.122830704
gonna die from cancer and your poetry and all the other amazing things that you,0.72022724
share with the world i am unstoppable oh that's crazy like i literally was telling,0.47185478
y'all someone came up to me and said yeah this film is about you know,0.09409074
a person you know losing their daughter and then aliens and then connected would you,0.1881687
guys have thought that this would be one of the ways it reads the same,0.0730631
forward from beginning and end all right that's no it's clicking i don't know i,0.08018863
think i clicked this when i first watched this but i can't remember me like,0.08189224
getting it but i'm like re-clicking things and i'm like damn it's basically like trying,0.53490317
to it's like you realizing you've already lived and picking up the pieces from where,0.11913014
you've left off i'm not sure if that's like a good way to remember but,0.11067736
that's basically what i'm feeling like that's it's like it's like imagine yourself already have,0.1552175
lived years like you're in the future but you just don't know it until now,0.12173771
and like your memories start kicking in like deja vu from the future i believe,0.36034516
it was important for you to see that um i called you didn't i yes,0.10439228
you did wow wow dude that's insane like what the heck it's like memento but,0.70650655
like just like like if if you told the story of memento in a five-dimensional,0.07665277
level how i i don't know ah the music building is just oh my god,0.14861616
it's like it's so good man it's so good wow like i'm getting a lot,0.186204
of christopher nolan vibes from that too because it's dealing with time you know which,0.09769965
is a very commendable thing gone disappeared thin air dude that's just like this is,0.10189635
just like probably one of my favorite portrayals of just communicating with aliens that i've,0.12329898
seen in a while a very long time this was a commendable film and the,0.06062018
whole time she knows that's what hurts man like she knows that is just brutal,0.39110813
man it's brutal but she saved everyone you know what surprised me the most that,0.15398552
wasn't meeting them is meeting you damn that line hurts so bad that line hits,0.7929297
man damn man dude i mean again guys this part's probably muted for y'all but,0.8382061
like the feels the emotions and the fact that she's aware of it all you,0.10675536
know just make sure just appreciate it even more yeah guys and that is the,0.051736224
end of arrival all right everybody we just got done finishing up our re-watching of,0.17005923
arrival and man i'm so happy i rewatched this because i just i appreciate it,0.1165346
just through the roof to the moon and back on my second time and just,0.055483013
you know having a better understanding of what was really being you know showcased as,0.057412755
on top of like the beautiful cinematography and the pacing of this film i think,0.13423648
this film is just excellent it's a plus material not only have i've never seen,0.18917497
anything like i mean anything quite like it this takes just sci-fi to a whole,0.15428296
new meaning a lot of the times we think of sci-fi as this you know,0.0568543
action adventure um you know just journey of the universe and it 100 is but,0.026226383
that's just one out of the trillions and infinite possibilities where you could take sci-fi,0.07129954
and i remember this comment that i remember reading on one of our sci-fi videos,0.081656724
that we watched i i don't know what video it was but you know they,0.10337864
said that oh yeah actually sci-fi is something that's already been tapped into you know,0.105075225
you can't really do anything more with it it's actually being worn out and then,0.136331
you have films like arrival coming in and saying nah nah you guys were just,0.31089434
dealing with all the action what about communicating what about that and incorporating it with,0.06729273
psychological storytelling that is very personal and implementing time travel in a way or like,0.0613905
time uh dimensions all of that and then even better the alien designs what like,0.16693024
it was just so haunting but like there was this gentle abstraction to them their,0.10230417
designs were just so so real it's it's it's quite interesting to say that because,0.07141347
again this is imagination this is purely imagination but it was really grounded with reality,0.068126045
not even just on how humans would react but just aliens that's incredible that's super,0.18154144
awesome so guys let me know what your thoughts are in the comments below i,0.10399977
would love to hear them especially for this film like always guys stay healthy and,0.14028259
stay hydrated because we are just getting started purple jacket pocket full of wheat everything,0.073678285
that i should ever need grab some matches cause they give em free just like,0.1033656
