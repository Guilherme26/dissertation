book-smart is a movie that is great there's a good interest death I really nailed it hello my dude Steph cozy here and welcome to my channel today we're talking about a movie that has been out for a while but I for some reason I haven't seen it until recently I don't know what's wrong with me so I don't know how relevant this review is gonna be but I loved this movie so much that I want to talk about it anyway so here we go book smart is directed and written by Olivia Wilde which cool love olivia wilde didn't know that she did that but she does and she's great at it apparently this is her directorial debut very exciting for her very exciting for people like me who like her words what am I saying and it's a movie about two female best friends who are graduating high school and realizing that they didn't have any fun in school all of they did was work and study and try to get into a good college and they find out that everyone else in their school that most of high school partying and having fun and they also got into really good colleges and so they're realizing like oh we up we didn't have any fun in high school we're going to the same schools as everyone else so what we did we did it wrong so they decide to fix it all in one night before graduation to just go crazy go to a party do all the things that they didn't get to do in the four years they were in high school and it's so much fun it felt to me very much like a modern day super bad because it all takes place in one night it's a lot of crazy and partying with high schoolers and it's that like coming-of-age two best friends trying to become more than what they are I don't know it's not as deep as that but you know what I'm trying to say and it was just perfect it was so perfect in every way Kaitlyn Dever and beanie Feldstein who play the two best friends the two main characters have amazing chemistry they're so funny so phenomenal together and just everything they did throughout this film was amazing and I loved every second of it they're really really funny and also just very good actors like I was very impressed with their performances but it's just a really fun female buddy comedy high school comedy and it has that really great like triumphant feel-good moment at the end like all of these movies always have and it has a really compelling arc like it's these two best friends they've been through a lot together they're growing up they're moving on there's a lot of growth a lot of character development it's kind of a coming-of-age sort of film so it has a perfect balance of comedy and ridiculousness mixed with heart and compassion and growth and it just leaves you feeling really good and I loved that I think this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time I was crying I was laughing so hard it's so funny from beginning to end like just ridiculously funny so funny and after thinking about it I honestly feel like this might be my favorite movie of the year so far it had everything that I want in a good film it was funny it was heartwarming it was entertaining consistently and I just had a really great time and I would totally buy this movie watch it again I think it's an instant classic it felt kind of timeless I feel like it's a movie that I'll watch anytime anywhere with friends by myself 10 years from now like it just it holds up like I said it felt very much like Superbad which is one of my favorite movies and I think that film is gonna hold up forever so if you like Superbad you're gonna love this movie there's just no question so yeah I'm gonna hands down and give book-smart a 5 out of 5 I don't have any complaints I thought it was great so that's it for my review did you guys see book-smart let me know in the comments below what you thought about it I'd love to hear your thoughts I'd love to talk about it I know it's been a while since it came out so maybe you've all seen it already I don't know tell me what you thought and if you didn't see it go see it it's really really good but that's it for this video thank you guys so much for watching my name's Steph codes would be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already be sure to smash that like blah my camera just died and I don't have another battery so I'm just gonna finish it like this like this video if you like to dive cefco so thank you for watching I'll see you guys in the next video bye [Music]
