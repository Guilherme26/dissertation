"Hey, guys, so I went to watch Wonder Woman? Okay, so we all know that the most anticipated movie of the summer was Wonder Woman? Now did it live up to a type? I personally like to think that Yes, Wonder Woman did live up to the height"
If you see the final trailer for Wonder Woman
That trailer does justice to the movie
"I mean, just like every other action movie and stuff, it could really go bad"
"But in my opinion, I thought this movie was fantastic and my favorite part of movie was how they wrote these characters"
how these characters were portrayed
"So you have these characters, Diana and Steve Truck"
"Now, the thing that I love most about them was the fact that yes, Diana, Wonder Woman, she is powerful"
"She's strong, she's indestructible She's amazing"
"She is Wonder Woman And then you have Steve Trevor, who's just a soldier"
"He's just an average, not average guy, but I really liked how they didn't make him weak to make her look strong"
"I feel like that is a huge problem with Tv shows, movies, books that a lot of the times just to make a female character stronger, they usually write the male characters as weaker, stupid, and just overall horrible just to make the female characters look stronger"
"Now for me, that is a cheap way to write a story and characters you do not need to make one character weaker in order to make another character look stronger"
That's just my personal opinion
"Sorry, I had to get that out there anyway, but here I love how this showed that she needed him and the rest of the guys and he needed her as well"
They really tag-teamed And that's what I really love about this movie
"He was strong and he was fierce and he had a good head on his shoulders, but so was she and I think their partnership was fantastic"
Now the next thing that I really loved about this movie was Diana's morals
"I love that, even in the face of battle and everything, she has a strong belief and your belief that keeps you going"
"I mean, for me, this movie is kind of like"
you mix the story of Percy Jackson with Captain America and Bam
"You get this woman movie Because this movie shows a lot of Mythology, but it also took place during World War Two, and Diana really reminds me of Steve Rogers"
I know I don't know
I'm probably the only one that thinks that they're just so innocent and pure
"They just wanted to send people even though they know that they're flawed and they could be horrible, But it's just their inner drive to help people no matter who they are, and that's what I absolutely love about Wonder Woman"
"She's fierce, she kicks butt"
"She is just amazing, but at the same time she has a heart of gold"
She really wants to help humanity
"So overall, I loved, Loved, loved this movie"
"While I was watching those fight scenes, I was like, Yes, this movie is what we need"
