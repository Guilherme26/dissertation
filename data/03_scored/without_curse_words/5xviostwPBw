hello I'm Christine and Avengers endgame has happened and game is out I've seen it,0.06538919
it's happened you've probably seen it I'm gonna start this off with my spoiler for,0.15228157
your view but then I'm gonna go into my five favorite moment my punch that,0.3817718
made me emotional like Parts I had little issues with all sorts and categories that,0.10117082
are spoilery so just beware get ready for the warning but overall thoughts I mean,0.19173987
what a feat these last 10 years have been for Marvel no matter what they,0.122845635
did it was gonna be really hard to wrap this up in a way that,0.06411738
made everyone happy but I think they wrap this up in a way that made,0.057407346
everyone happy I did like I said I had some issues that kind of nip,0.27040324
at me but I enjoyed the hell out of myself there are so many fantastic,0.37817633
moments I loved it and I can't wait to see it again and was it,0.090618685
as good as infinity war in my opinion No infinity war to me is perfection,0.24052228
but this is much harder than the first half of the end because the first,0.07428853
half of the end isn't the end and the end has to be satisfying in,0.08676946
so many different ways there's a lot to tie up and I think they did,0.05486937
a really great job with it there was bound to be a little fraying along,0.068169795
the edges because there's so many characters so overall I'm gonna give endgame a 90%,0.06811747
I think I gave infinity or a 98 or 100 it's still an a it's,0.059365764
just not an A plus plus plus plus spoilers are coming goodbye non-spoilery people okay,0.15173745
so I had to organize this video because there's way too much going on and,0.07827935
I definitely have more than five of each of these categories but I had to,0.08200726
narrow it down or this would be a three hour long video I thinks the,0.15540677
rider said that was genius Sun Linsanity war review I talked about how they can't,0.16145433
just bring everyone back you know we can't just use the time stone rewind and,0.06471487
poof everyone back in this movie but in a way it felt like some sort,0.29749247
of time travel was inevitable right here's a time soon but the way the writers,0.065731145
did it was beautifully biggest genius move that they made was coming us off from,0.08652675
the very beginning so will we start immediately they go after Thanos immediately we realized,0.24650964
the stones are gone poop they're gone he destroyed them so there's no stones and,0.49083906
we killed him Thanos is dead within the first 20 minutes the movie we're all,0.66500735
kind of thrown off kilter a bit like I thought that was gonna be more,0.24234045
difficult but already all our theories about getting the stones back from him are gone,0.10909269
there are no stones what do we do now and the second genius part of,0.10119754
that right there is five years later those five years made all the emotional loss,0.069718935
we felt from all those moments and infinity work pay off because there was no,0.070182085
proof they're back they had five years they had to live in this world without,0.11850241
them for five years the world had to keep going and that changes the ballgame,0.11285678
I don't know why I just made a sports reference our characters have to deal,0.035506032
with so much and have to evolve and become new versions of themselves gave our,0.06372604
character so much more of an emotional punch when it came time to get the,0.15218653
stones back three I was worried about Captain Marvel going to this movie after seeing,0.12441309
half to Marvel I'd feel like Captain Marvel is the son and Kartik how is,0.17644815
there gonna be any struggle in this movie you know I think it was such,0.15040027
a smart decision to have her all universe helping other planets our heroes needed to,0.051259547
try to fix this themselves whilst I don't really know why they didn't ping her,0.10807893
about they're going back in time play and they just you know what I've had,0.035767157
with it without her I still think it was better without having her there because,0.23718727
everything would have been too easy she's such a force that you don't get the,0.15198357
same fight you know there isn't that struggle in that fear that maybe we won't,0.055858046
wait at the end when she was fighting Thanos there was still a fight you,0.12241113
know there was still struggle and I loved seeing that I loved watching her have,0.12637345
a hard time there but I still don't fully understand the limits of her power,0.12782095
and I don't think we as a whole do because we've only seen her in,0.08146159
such a limited period of time and unlimited scenarios with her power thus far and,0.09782507
Tony Stark's character arc it's no secret that Ironman is my favorite Avenger if you,0.08463268
didn't know Ironman is my favorite Avenger he has been since the very first Iron,0.0694355
Man movie and his emotional art has been so beautiful I loved seeing him and,0.20610628
pepper settle down and have a kid I loved watching him interact with his Caleb,0.2406769
- that conversation he had with his father he's come so far from that first,0.1373662
movie the first time he talks to Captain America he's like you're not the one,0.22247173
to make that sacrifice play and then he does he makes that cyber heist play,0.19916369
for New York at the end of Avengers and then he makes the biggest sacrifice,0.12874693
you know he sacrifices himself for everyone for everyone in the universe this piece of,0.3533476
fan art says that all y'all top five favorite moments gotta start with the best,0.059032854
moment of the entire film oh my god I think everyone across the land lived,0.08919051
their shits this elation just flown through me and exploded out my mouth when Thor's,0.9156528
hammer rose off the ground in two caps awaiting had I couldn't even contain myself,0.30040392
he's just a magical moment at comedy and age of Ultron paid off tenfold in,0.14900556
this moment oh my god I will never forget this collective ten seconds in the,0.10477978
theater well we were all just losing it together they were like two eight-year-old kids,0.16077189
next to me and after like I screamed and whooped I'm pretty sure I was,0.16376083
just like next favorite moment is another cat moment this movie I finally came around,0.07937178
to cap the moment in the elevator when he gets in the elevator in there,0.058226746
back in time it's such a throwback to Winter Soldier and we're all just immediately,0.10715947
excited like they're doing it they're doing the Winter Soldier thing we're all expecting a,0.057451326
fight to break out he just leans over and goes it's okay hail Hydra oh,0.28365293
my god what excellent three the moment we seem pepper fly up in the Iron,0.13004462
Man suit my heart the tears the happiness coursing through my veins just shot through,0.4467491
the roof it was just so wonderful and rewarding to see her there fighting for,0.076984555
their world with everyone else mm-hmm for that moment when Captain Marvel has hold of,0.092935465
the gauntlet vitamins like I don't know how you're gonna throw that alone and all,0.28691924
the women show up behind her and they're like she won't be alone and they,0.33859
just keep coming all them just keeps showing up in the Wasson the Valkyrie it,0.1641587
was just such a beautiful moment it was kind of a callback to the moment,0.0637163
where Scarlet Witch is about to be killed by one of fan doses children in,0.7034821
infinity war and they go you're gonna die alone and like when I was like,0.6782262
she's not alone and Michonne is there fives a moment where scarlet wit shows up,0.13589205
in front of Thanos and she's like you took everything from me he goes I,0.30861634
don't even know you she's like you will now ah and she tapes him down,0.3993084
that he was going to take him out Thanos was trippin the only reason she,0.26349348
didn't kill him right then and there was because the sky started raining fire from,0.3388874
his ship what a badass Wanda has had amazing moments in these two films she,0.47449625
doesn't get that much screen time and the other ones but boy she just shines,0.052432727
in these two movies and she's barely in this movie oh well we see how,0.15027937
we see her last one that scene or spider-man and Iron Man reunite on the,0.13134558
field and Peter starts filling in made on what happened mr. Schad you wouldn't believe,0.15966439
how I turn into dust and then I just woke up and dr. strangers like,0.15147531
it's been five years and Tony just gives him a hug you know it's just,0.069171846
such a full-circle moment from when we first saw them together we'll be on to,0.06951233
five times I cried I cried way more than five times the second the opening,0.077015564
scene started and it was Hawkeye and his daughter I was like oh my god,0.09474362
I'm gonna have to watch him watch his family who the away I started crying,0.27263477
right then from the very first moment they had me and it didn't let up,0.050384726
the entire time when I laughed it was like laughing through teary-eyed miss moment -,0.24023747
and Tony Stark was rescued and brought back down to earth you know he basically,0.0731584
had a mental breakdown and he takes the thing out of his chest and I,0.59164286
lost it - gasp it came out of my mouth it was brutal man three,0.69541794
second I realized they were going to varam here I know they don't know that,0.075947724
they knows kill Kimura because he need to do for the Soul so bone so,0.6364068
frustrated that like no one even theorized but that could have possibly been in it,0.15221484
why would it be because none of the other stones required that although I didn't,0.05412618
think I was gonna cry it didn't really hit me in the soul until Hawkeye,0.25060928
jumped off and Natasha jumped after him and they were like hanging from the thread,0.44538376
and the same music was playing from when Gamora was pushed just brought all those,0.028468855
feel back it was the same shots and it's just so upsetting and I'm crying,0.18827894
again for that moment the big three are fighting Thanos at the end and they're,0.07343689
losing again it doesn't really hit you emotionally until caps shield starts breaking Santos is,0.18512017
breaking his shield it gets you so down but then it makes moment five so,0.09877884
much more rewarding the entire theater broke out in tears I just started crying harder,0.15379764
it was a happy cry when all the portals started opening up and everyone came,0.10653702
out of it you you just hear the Black Panther army like I above bay,0.24185976
and such a beautiful moment and they all just get there kind of cameos as,0.06744732
you go across all the different portals and it's just such a fantastic overwhelming scene,0.101284005
we feel all the things and they look at banners and he's like I wasn't,0.067474835
expecting that and six yes I have one more at Toni's funeral when that little,0.1278742
wreath floats out onto the lake and it's holding true that Tony Stark has a,0.05750381
heart okay my favorite jokes opposite end of the spectrum here there are so many,0.108406805
great funny moments in this film I did see I wasn't expecting as many as,0.101339236
we got but they were woven in beautifully the first one for me as the,0.08072519
first scene after the cold open with nebula and Tony playing paper football at the,0.06929838
table Tony trying to teach nebula how to have fun it was really really nice,0.0837464
- what a great moment it was we went back to 2014 on that planet,0.11522915
where star-lord started a guardians of the galaxy the whole sequence is iconic now him,0.06108959
dancing with the headphones on I got the music rocket and then we pull out,0.06610811
and see them nebula and war machines Andrew to this very dangerous weapon on this,0.17307457
planet so he's an idiot yes three here another nebula moment maybe they really shine,0.92201954
does the straight man and a lot of the jokes movie and this one she,0.23993899
in rocket just landing outside the avengers headquarters and it manson there was taco taco,0.07508899
blows away and she walks up and stops and she's like rocket be careful this,0.25258344
idiot us four is when Thor is catching the Avengers up on his experience with,0.88360626
the Infinity stones and everyone's just side eyeing each other and then you go to,0.14213592
ant-man and he's like oh yeah subtler nodding along totally and do it it's just,0.36880982
great everything that ant-man at this table was great because he's so irrelevant and that,0.48099735
brings me to the crowning moment of this whole table scene where rocket walks over,0.111553125
to ant-man and starts patting his head rock it really shined comedic lee in this,0.40320784
film he didn't have too many lines but every line he had was fantastic I,0.08417958
liked the moment in the beginning where it's so dark and everyone's so sad and,0.13476956
rocket speaks and Tony goes literally up to this moment I thought you were built,0.07413935
of air and rockets like maybe I am the final category issues I had with,0.10036391
the film hahaha it's very rare that a film does time-travel like this one does,0.0808524
and it doesn't step into any plot holes like there's just too many direction my,0.14992312
first issue with the film I'm accepting it it's fine it's just gonna be something,0.08777836
that floats around in my head because I love time-travel stuff and I want to,0.19225632
know exactly how everything works and I feel like the roles of this time-travel universe,0.05514732
were kind of blurry they were like Back to the Future Back to the Future,0.13539629
yeah that's not how time works you dink it and then we're all like then,0.1781333
how does it work how does it work and they never explain it I need,0.080789134
a lecture so I could just so we can see it cuz there are moments,0.08693378
where I just just don't see it I know hypothetically the idea that they take,0.1268074
the stones way and then put them all back makes it so nothing happens but,0.15016936
in between the time where they're not there and they're using them doesn't everything change,0.08359469
until they put them back and it changes but you know I'm saying what he's,0.092924304
I need the parameters so I can visualize the timeline is it just is it,0.052844632
going off into the darkest I just need to know it's not clear and I'm,0.09592778
sure maybe they have it clear in their heads but my head is blurring like,0.49736688
what nebulous shot herself at the end oh that that's past you why didn't she,0.33748263
a battery why didn't she fade out of the picture they go back to the,0.08329275
future see this do the rule is that my mind could comprehend I was just,0.06606568
like whoa what what what it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense now that,0.09232523
Gamora is in the present day what happened to past good morning past Moore never,0.08873077
happened what - this water juice I get something about it cats chill okay so,0.084105976
cap has his emotional ball but at the end and it refined of ruin the,0.24934672
moment before me didn't ruin it but like it made it less potent sounds like,0.12093123
where did you get that shield cat last time I saw it was broken it,0.08769524
was pretty broken I was crying about it okay and now he's just hot shiny,0.4473268
brand-new one where did you where'd you get that I just did you steal it,0.41620502
from yourself in the past I mean because he's still had to go through this,0.13036044
moment I just wait I don't get it like how is it shiny and new,0.063385405
but also old but you're all the wood bro have you got it from the,0.25474763
past you still need to give it to your few dips in your future self,0.17725177
and you've hurt yourself broken did some either new one I did Commission a new,0.42401198
one but then it's not like his shield it's just like a new shield I,0.15398663
loved when he kind of passed the torch to Falcon little of Falcon he's so,0.08850402
cool I wish she was in the movies more but hey I just where'd you,0.15024766
get it we explained three lookey and the tesseract look you picked up the tesseract,0.07784604
yo and disappeared and how come this hasn't change of timeline where are the ripples,0.08525687
I just I can't comprehend it he just goes off into a separate timeline cuz,0.08927684
he was already in our timeline so why didn't it change the time in the,0.059774574
present Oh does that mean at this time that we saw them fighting that Loki,0.099437594
was also off with a third tesseract like there's the tesseract in that time Santos,0.12845705
is broken there's a tesseract that they have in their glove and then there's also,0.09488054
Loki off in another world land with his tesseract like I don't how could they,0.15476184
coexist what's happening what we never resolved that so I'm assuming it has something to,0.05705457
do with one of the various shows Disney's working on but I don't understand how,0.06162996
it didn't affect Avenger tae-hwan he's just saying this always happened like did he always,0.097740866
take it for this isn't a huge issue it's just very confusing there's a touching,0.07467129
moment when ant-man opened the door and his daughter was there I teared up but,0.1455912
also I was like why is this daughter a hundred years older we saw her,0.10651059
five minutes alone she's like 11 and now she's like 28 I mean she's at,0.21474701
my age I couldn't really compute like it was five years so she should be,0.1140112
like 1718 a most what happened there five I where there I have a couple,0.054984923
more than five plus five is there nothing with the time and the age kind,0.04402974
of making things a little confusing because spider-man at the end reuniting with Ned they,0.13085811
have this nice moment but at the same time we all have to think that,0.046195846
high school is less than five years so either both of them poof in that,0.3504092
case they hadn't seen each other since like two days ago or something and they're,0.058217086
having an emotional reunion or he didn't poof and didn't age and is still in,0.17526783
high school five years later it doesn't make any sense and also so for this,0.0960912
to work for spider-man to every one of spider-man's people who is friends with has,0.15269195
to have poofed so that they could still be in school together or they're just,0.19478498
all three falling it out of school and there's still friends and that's why they're,0.083670475
going far away from home I haven't watched the spider-man trailers so please don't spoil,0.082620844
me six this is the most annoying thing for me first with Thor he's back,0.3170158
in time and this is the only chance you have to save the universe like,0.053159144
not just one person or ten people or a country the universe and Thor's like,0.106142715
I had this I can't do this I need someone it goes to you whine,0.41075376
like this isn't a serious thing and he just takes his sweet-ass time and like,0.8431025
Rockets like no this is serious and he walks off and Thor just like turns,0.14815855
around walks the other way and disappears this is no time for hijinks no of,0.27636877
course rocket gets done because he gets it done but it still was like really,0.09492354
right now and then the other one was really irritated with uncap walked into Peggy's,0.08308969
office without realizing it he was like oh what well officer accidentally stumble into nostalgically,0.11771031
to look off into the distance Peggy and then he looks through the window and,0.092890345
we're on a time line people are noticing that they don't belong here we need,0.10821231
to get out of there he needs to find Iron Man but he's just like,0.13624763
oh look Peggy and he slowly looks through the window and slowly comes really close,0.18339668
to it et phone home me love Peggy and I'm just dead you're like excuse,0.35498288
me people need you get out of there you have a mission what you're doing,0.17840205
we'll come back a time you see her later if you don't do this now,0.17854133
you can never see Peggy but he's just like LA and I get it we're,0.1491726
supposed to be like Oh cap and Peggy never really even started but like right,0.16775346
now I don't care because everyone poofed if you don't do this right now that's,0.37224594
it I know everything works out fine except for one thing and that that's my,0.1520172
next number seven like we all saw this nebulous thing coming a mile away I,0.11263557
wish it was just like a little a little less obvious that nebula and I,0.109121606
Bueller go switch places and the other nebula would be the evil Nebula and then,0.31089434
a little thing don't get me wrong it was fun to have Shrek in the,0.09647345
film but I just think it was a weird tonal shift that happened very quickly,0.098216556
look also we see Bruce Banner and he's like a better Hulk and Hulk is,0.062347952
gone after we just got to know Hulk as a separate person in thor ragnarok,0.083895795
a couple years ago it's just weird that they gave him like a separate personality,0.13790438
so we kind of got to know both people Bruce Banner and Hulk and then,0.07876231
Hulk was gone it wasn't a mess should the two of them it was just,0.13672565
bruised and it's kind of like okay where did Hulk go and also how did,0.13318272
this happen it's kind of a one-off where he just says you know I exposed,0.15301268
myself to more gamma radiation and then we fused into one but really we just,0.053509753
fused into Bruce Banner with Hulk's body I just thought it kind of felt silly,0.59402215
the whole time I like original Bruce Banner that we meet in Avengers he just,0.07604186
comes off much smarter and when Bruce Banner looks like the Hulk he just kinda,0.27259818
seems silly like you try to be smart but he's really just a baby in,0.69542736
a giant body when he's trying to figure out how to send ant-man through time,0.24747542
and ant-man is just like circling throughout human lifespan that's how I picked you Bruce,0.47139877
Banner when he's the Hulk he's just so goofy I'd love to know your top,0.66379124
five in any of the categories that I went through I'm so excited that star,0.108926065
might be in the Guardians 3 he's gone my name is Christine my book comes,0.07982495
out like next week for the game but better it will be available wherever books,0.05307605
are sold but if you're interested and you'd like to preorder it there are links,0.14513686
in the description below and they videos every Tuesday and I will see you next,0.41908082
