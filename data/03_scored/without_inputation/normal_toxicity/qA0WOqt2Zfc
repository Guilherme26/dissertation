hello welcome to R&B reviews I'm rob and a few months ago I actually back in April I was i decided i was going to attempt to watch and review every single film that was made by the classic comedy,0.061892763
team,0.055086873
the marx brothers who starred in popular state shows in the 1920s and made a series of films in the 1930s right up till the mid early 40's their first film was the coconut which was made in 1929 and their last film was love happy which was made in 1949,0.047248136
i managed to get through their first five films and i had to take a break for a while because I some things came into my life where I couldn't I just didn't have the time,0.10405081
but now I think I can go back to what I set out to do and try and review every single one of their films,0.16459976
and today I'm going to be reviewing a Night at the Opera which is arguably their best film that was made in 1935,0.056960206
and it was originally released by MGM,0.043318532
and the plot is Groucho Marx plays business manager Otis be driftwood who convinces his client mrs. Claypool played by Margaret Dumont to invest in the New York opera company and Chico and Harpo Marx play comment who tries to convince Groucho to consider their friend Alan Jones for the Opera Company,0.061743703
while they're looking at other people,0.06637433
and arrange for you to unless you hundred thousand dollars in the New York opera company I go to defense don't you see you'll be a patron of the aircraft you'll get into society and you can marry me take you on a society,0.14791736
and all you've lost is to run about you know this smarts the first time that the brothers made a movie at MGM after leaving paramount pictures as well as their brother Zeppo behind behind,0.29958093
and if you look at the early paramount films and these later MGM ones you kind of do notice a bit of a difference for one the brows were definitely much more family-friendly they became characters that the audience could root for instead of people running around archaically poking fun at everyone,0.057649013
now they only poked fun,0.24874388
at the films of these films,0.14919934
and they were definitely much more alike do you understand you're fired hey a big bully wants the idea of hitting that little boys,0.53490317
well you kinda let me handle my own affairs Cal,0.10568098
now what do you got to say to me justice can you sleep on your stomach with such big buttons on your pajamas boy you many people have felt like this was kind of out of character for Groucho Marx because Groucho poked fun at everybody but I mean if you look at some movies like animal crackers and coconuts sometimes you would go out of his way to help the leading man into romantic couples subplot even though sometimes they could be a bit annoying,0.33579427
but for some people that this was a bit too much of a change to have him do that also another thing you'll notice this groucho's lines are not all double entendres because of the new film morals code that had came around where you couldn't talk about sex or drugs and some stuff like that in the movies they could be clean wholesome fun which is what kind of did Mae West in when she was making her films although watching this movie I noticed that a few of these double attendre jokes kind of slipped through the full sensor circuit,0.24082787
I think we've got to keep everything on a business faces,0.1475111
how do you like that,0.07481675
every time,0.07809457
I get romantic with you want to talk business,0.16382147
I don't know there's something about me that brings out the business and every woman also another thing you'll notice is romantic couples were more prominent granted the romantic couple these young romantic subplot of these couples was prompt was always in Marx Brothers movie since the coconuts but now they definitely are a little bit more forward the reason was become this MGM didn't think Camille they're comedians could carry a film on their own although duck soup and horse feathers that they made at Paramount showed that they could NGM believe that the audience is wanted a variety of entertainment,0.14571993
so in these comedy musicals you've got comedy scenes musical numbers and you have the young romantic couples to let the audience take a breath from their laughters in this film of the couple is played by Alan Johnson kitty Carlisle they're definitely the more tolerable ones in these energy m films,0.13967673
and of course the formula changed Paramount's films like I've been saying we're just most of them are just a bunch of gags strong on a very thin storyline,0.3126063
but here there is plot you get scenes where you feel sorry for,0.12983547
the marx's like there's a scene which I always remembers when grouches getting kicked out of the Opera Company rather roughly in this movie,0.31089434
and many people find it depressing,0.14939764
but that was the MGM formula if you look at the film's and Jim films of Buster Keaton and red skeleton as well as the two films Laurel and Hardy made over there warns of nothing but trouble they followed the formula like one example in the character when the Communists are down and they decide that there's nothing to do,0.07614198
and they decide to step on up and mess with the people who mess with them kind of like the Bugs Bunny cartoons where somebody messes with puts money in bud spaces,0.27724737
This Means War course you know This Means War and he goes in and screw things up just to get back at them under another thing you'll notice is Night at the Opera is a much more polished film than the rough paramount films the what happened was the brothers went on tour to try out these comedy scenes and the writers polished them love based on audiences reactions,0.1514365
which is why one of the reasons why I think coconuts and animal crackers worked very well because they're dummies company seems so very well when they were doing the show wife and also not at the Opera contains some of their best comedy hits including the famous contracts in between Groucho and Chico,0.4143595
the state room scene where the groucho is living in a little stateroom on a ship and people keep coming in and out,0.18611315
and there's also a very honorary underrated one with with the brothers eating breakfast together at the whole tire agreement is automatically notified,0.047678635
well I don't know it's all right that that's an every contract,0.09169864
that's that's what they call,0.06246696
the sanity clause,0.061696813
you can't follow me there,0.15268226
ain't no sanity glorious also,0.12835525
the comedy in the night the Opera is much more deliberately paced,0.118715875
and it's not so rapid as it happened before Chico gets to do a very verbal comedy bit like the ones Groucho used to do,0.18702361
and Alan Jones is definitely more likable as the leading in,0.050246924
and some of the later ones friends talk fast,0.109855585
I see a man in the crowd with a rope how we happen to come to America is a great story but I don't tell that,0.15081045
so now I tell you how we fly to America the first time I we started we get a half way of course when we run outta gasoline and we got to go back then I take a place in watching gasoline this time we were just about the land may be creepy when what do you think we're another gasoline again and the fact that we're going in to get the mortgage that I didn't kick,0.18338391
one of the things,0.060079947
I didn't care for about 90,0.10031547
operas Margaret Dumont character to me just wasn't as memorable as mrs.,0.16069874
Rittenhouse from animal crackers or mrs.,0.16100451
Teasdale from duck soup,0.17944467
I think the reason is because here she seems more annoyed at Groucho and just doesn't fine as attracted as they as she had in those previous films another big problem that i have with some of these later MGM films the Marx Brothers dudes is sometimes you have to fast-forward through the musical numbers or the romantic subplots,0.088301525
well if you watch something like horse feathers or duck soup,0.27517185
you don't have to fast-forward through anything it can just sit back relax from beginning to end,0.084411755
but regardless not if the opera is a I think despite that the movie is very funny me,0.07241378
it was never as good as duck super animal crackers but they definitely the brothers definitely put on great great performances the bits the comedy bits are again one of their best-known routines and I think they do adapt to the changes very well I mean Groucho Marx said that this was one of his favorite films that they had made a Night at the Opera is again,0.14439888
many people sue it as the start of the decline of their pictures but overall it's definitely funny you may have to fast-forward through some stuff and obviously if you don't like opera music you're going to probably fest go through some of the Opera bits but I mean there's not too many of them in the movie but it's a funny movie the brothers deliver despite some changes,0.095882915
so if you're new to the Marx Brothers this might be one you'd be willing to check out,0.08716027
there's always been debates about what type of Marx Brothers films that they like you like the early roughhouse archaic ones they made it paramount or these later ones where they were more likeable and you could root for them,0.1229207
you know why don't you be,0.2744798
