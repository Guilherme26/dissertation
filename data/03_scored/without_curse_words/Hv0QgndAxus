today on the daily review i'm going to be very professional because hi film students,0.123863086
at boston college in fm fm33901.01 fall semester american film genres monday devlin 023 5,0.06950468
to 5 30 i mean 3 to 5 30. hi welcome this is a supplement,0.17067215
to your class as well as part of my infamous youtube channel with thousands and,0.4438606
thousands and thousands of seconds of content today we're doing singing in the rain and,0.050571702
i'm gonna be super professional about it because this is the best uh it's good,0.08209955
it's a stanley doanen classic from 1952 today on the daily review with me joel,0.10831643
larocca all right guys all right so seriously all joking aside welcome to the channel,0.1434468
if you're new here what's up biandi one of the people i do know that,0.09603479
watches it all right so honestly in class uh tomorrow we're going to watch the,0.13914973
blues brothers and it's pretty fun it's pretty long so uh this is um and,0.10336156
because last week we had labor day or whatever and we didn't have monday class,0.10957155
so it was it was all disastrous let me get rid of hands cameras it,0.42463684
makes very little sense right now and od is not in here if she shows,0.1338889
up i guess i'll shut it off now too that camera's normally for my dog,0.31089434
if you're new to the channel uh she's downstairs anyway um so normally we would,0.09444641
have huh we would have watched uh those gels fell again that's the second it's,0.09547598
a theme on this channel that colored gels will fall in the background and scare,0.3565486
me anyway uh um so yeah normally we would have watched singing in the rain,0.06987832
in class and then we would have discussed it but we didn't have it because,0.033196535
it was labor day and so i'm kind of trying to supplement this now so,0.09765008
i probably have sent this link to the class that's what you know all the,0.047497764
other regular viewers want to know what's going on but anyway i love this movie,0.071383946
singing the rain i think it's it's definitely my top five favorite comedies i think,0.068635724
it's just so perfect and joyful and colorful and full of hope and all the,0.0884057
things that comedies and musicals are kind of supposed to be about it's like ah,0.09768869
the human spirit is alive and it's tap dancing on my face i love it,0.30582544
um so i'm gonna kind of go through it more chronologically than we normally do,0.11645213
on this channel um so it's a satire it's a musical it's a romantic comedy,0.20472732
it's everything it's got so many things going on but it starts in a very,0.07027082
important time in hollywood 1927. what's important about that class somebody's hand goes up maybe,0.06948272
one of the really smart kids and they'll go well joe that's about the time,0.10902655
the jazz singer came out talkies are about hell yeah baby so uh yeah the,0.37002376
popularity of talking pictures starts really uh coming well not 1927 that's kind of the,0.09960803
first big hit with the jazz singer but it's not for a few more years,0.18702553
until all the theaters start converting but the big studios are like we gotta do,0.09520958
this we gotta make this switch so what the overall movie is about is these,0.11436297
two stars don lamont and lena oh no wait don lockwood and lena lamont sorry,0.11332987
uh they're like a on-screen duo of the silent era and now they're potentially not,0.09400933
going to make the transition very well because uh oh lena she talks like this,0.15730731
like uh i am holly quinn and so and she's not uh the brightest bulb,0.33744633
so she is gonna be hard to sell in the talking pictures and this is,0.076934166
based in reality there are so many silent stars that were like king and queens,0.102851994
of the world that could not make the transition for multiple many different reasons and,0.042700537
then they just kind of fizzled out uh so a lot this movie's about adaptation,0.15027863
a lot too anyway so it starts on the red carpet for the you know,0.08534923
a lockwood lamont new movie and it's so satirical it's great about how like like,0.12728123
uh how uh like they're there they're as happy as new newlyweds even after two,0.14978175
weeks of marriage you know like the you know the transient nature of relationships in,0.057293333
hollywood and how this whole movie's gonna be a behind the curtains look like that,0.09375943
everything we're seeing is like a facade you know it's like it's and we know,0.1514861
that but we still get caught up in it i still get caught up in,0.07028644
like tabloid when i don't know but because that's why we like this stuff you,0.15038368
know but in reality we know that those people are like completely different than their,0.07656151
personas you know because they're marketing themselves as a product so then you know this,0.081011854
woman is like you know luck would tell us about your life and it gives,0.3537706
us like a through flashbacks that are contradictory to what he's saying which is really,0.060084525
genius about how he made his way up and it's dignity always dignity and it's,0.107405744
this lie about how we went to all the best schools and learn how to,0.23590098
dance but in reality it's how he was like a vaudevillian slowly working his way,0.12637264
up doing all these jobs and then was a stunt guy and then eventually uh,0.1061097
got a roll and uh it's great because it it it's that's really like a,0.09882166
great microcosm for what the media and hollywood is all about how it's like they,0.07398051
project this like disney image um and it's usually far from the reality and it,0.058032967
actually has like this really negative impact on society and we've seen kind of the,0.10859161
zenith of that with social media where it makes people really really depressed and messes,0.15988228
with people's heads and causes a lot of psychological problems when you think that people,0.34605032
are living this certain life for living this thing because all you're seeing is a,0.15318127
very you know like uh archaeologist level like dissection and pulling out just these very,0.08748848
specific things to to show the public to make them um you know love you,0.05615849
and not have any conflict odie wants to be enhancing never mind never mind i,0.17962432
thought he was trying to get in the door but it's not it wasn't it,0.06544933
was my roommate going into his room okay anyway um yeah so all that stuff,0.14567047
is great and like i was saying social media this ends up working nicely and,0.055598028
like still be continuing to be an issue of how the public sees um media,0.08278529
figures and when i say media i don't just mean the movies you know and,0.08783635
music i'm talking about like politics which has become the same thing you know especially,0.095435105
in the trump era anyway um there's one part that i feel like is um,0.06909703
like the the kind of like pinnacle moment of that whole sequence is that they're,0.04648292
all the audience is all looking at lena and how beautiful she is and one,0.102930486
woman just goes she's so refined i think i'll kill myself and that's when you,0.8743037
realize that this movie is a beaver if this movie had to be an animal,0.263135
it would be a beaver because like a beaver is smart and it's cute and,0.09713666
it's industrious but has really sharp teeth right it's social and it's kind it'll share,0.066467226
its damn with muskrats and all sorts of stuff but it's unique and and you,0.8575891
realize ah that this is gonna be a beaver of a movie water is just,0.06277671
gonna roll right off its back and just put it you know and you look,0.3229415
at like oh but it can take your finger off like it's still got teeth,0.3769481
it's still sharp it's not like hey hey hollywood's great like top hat or some,0.29974568
one of these other musicals from earlier you know maybe one of the ones you,0.08726706
watched for your old one because it's kind of late in that in that time,0.115452796
period uh but those earlier ones like in the code era are very watered down,0.10773732
you know this is still in the code era but it's it's snake-like in its,0.16366804
beaverness okay the metaphors are getting too mixed up anyway so then we go to,0.059667908
the that's the premiere of royal rascal and that's like a big silent hit and,0.4004469
uh at the after party uh we meet well we meet kathy sheldon that's debbie,0.15213677
reynolds character as he's trying to get away from all this stuff and then you,0.12946068
get they get to the after party and rf simpson who's like the big producer,0.13587229
in the movie is like i gotta show you something and it's a talkie it's,0.1486114
a talking picture kind of example and it's like this is the new thing jazz,0.061531484
singer is coming out it's gonna be the big new thing uh and but uh,0.07378835
you know we'll see maybe it won't be maybe it'll just be a fly by,0.09553226
the night i think obviously three weeks later it's the big new thing so the,0.08140758
movie they're working on dueling cavaliers uh is going to be transitioned into a musical,0.0969972
so uh uh not a musical excuse me a talkie and uh wait it i,0.3158221
spoiled it damn uh and uh so lena's gotta make the transition in one of,0.8026173
the most famous and comical scenes uh they the quiet rolling that whole sequence of,0.08006944
adjusting to the sound i think i've used that in like every class i've taught,0.10102786
because it's funny it's well shot it's well acted and then on top of it,0.31028897
it's got this great his memorable historic thing of like what it's like to have,0.10914809
a technological change in the industry and have everybody kind of adjusting to microphones because,0.078723215
you see it in cinema that like in the silent film era like the late,0.05465101
silent films are doing the craziest stuff some of the craziest stuff you've ever seen,0.35950416
like just as innovative as anything that comes out today and then the second you,0.10019325
put sound and confined confine it to a sound stage and have to have all,0.06639943
the prerequisites that you need for sync sound it really limits the movement of the,0.0758073
camera and all the creativity that goes into um making a movie because now you,0.28872177
got to get it kind of like it reset the industry for a long period,0.074043736
of time it took a while for them to get their legs back uh no,0.45717898
pun intended anyway uh so uh there's this relationship starting to happen there's the phony,0.29864782
relationship between lockwood and lamont but then there's this relationship that he starts having with,0.03540594
kathy sheldon who's like an up and coming dancer and who wants to break into,0.2622503
the business but she's honest and she's very talented she'd be a good uh a,0.14208832
good actress in this new world because she's a triple threat she can sing dance,0.37707195
and act as opposed to lena lamont who's also a triple threat because she can't,0.20155431
sing can't dance and can't act which i've always thought is really clever just like,0.14948513
put a spin on the word threat there uh there's a great scene that really,0.08397446
shows when they start falling in love cathy and don uh it's like in an,0.10621601
open sound studio they go in the sound stage and they go in there and,0.03854033
he turns on the fan and the music and the lights and i mean the,0.09087084
fan and the smoke machine the lights and they kind of have a love scene,0.06863658
as as they say um and it's really beautiful and it reminds me of that,0.09426648
scene in la la land that sucks that movie's stupid and it sucks and it,0.93093646
looks stupid and everything's cheesy it's like a gap commercial from the 90s i hate,0.8023453
it i hate the characters in that movie and what they're after is so stupid,0.8597041
and i hate la la land whoa whoa something broken him anyway after the soundstage,0.4033069
scene is the elocution scene uh i got ahead of myself when i did the,0.08216514
quiet rolling the elocution scene is the most fun scene in musical history that wrote,0.09451207
moses supposes his noses of roses and moses supposes erroneously that whole thing is awesome,0.1856377
and and and donald o'connor that's the other guy that's cosmo brown the piano player,0.26235244
maybe his character is gay do you ever think about that i think about it,0.7255092
a lot um i think that i think he is and they kind of just,0.07569331
dance around it his oh my god his performance in that is like holy schnikes,0.15038434
as we used to say back when anyway i was gonna say i mean chris,0.08357284
farley was alive but uh we're gonna talk about chris farley because we're watching the,0.08002028
blues brothers and you can't talk about belushi without talking about farley okay so anyway,0.15511952
then it could that goes to the quiet rolling scene and everything the movie's gonna,0.06606189
be a flop and that's when they come up with the idea hey let's make,0.15212344
it a musical oh no lena can't sing let's dub her voice with kathy's and,0.22139795
that's kind of the second plot point the first plot point being meeting kathy sheldon,0.2275797
and realizing it's a combination of that and realizing that we're going to have to,0.058303036
go the direction of talkies and then the second plot point is we have a,0.062831044
way of making this our own we can do the things we know and we,0.047085688
can use the technology right we can adapt to the technology and use dubbing so,0.042077754
that lena can just lip sync and then kathy can actually be singing for it's,0.05777179
you know it's pretty brilliant and obviously lena finds out and she doesn't want the,0.13734946
crowd not because the third act is all chaos i'm not going to go into,0.25811455
detail you should watch it uh i don't want to really spoil anything for the,0.10862289
people who are not in the class but that idea of like lena's going to,0.116685525
ruin kathy's career by saying fine she can play my voice but nobody knows and,0.24611536
she has to do it forever like as opposed to it just being like a,0.15719394
way to launch her career so uh i love it is so good and uh,0.4367816
that image of lena lips singing and then we see that and then we see,0.12429031
behind the stage we see kathy actually singing for her it's like just a great,0.06864462
you know the misonsen as we say so you have to be filmic because it's,0.195784
a class and stuff uh you know it's this beautiful like example of what the,0.09750774
movie's all about that it's like it that the truth is not what's being shown,0.07940321
to the audience what's being shown to the audience is is all fabricating it's all,0.041034587
it might make you feel something but it's not reality what reality is is happening,0.11890115
behind the behind the curtain you know um which is like a complicated and beautiful,0.11478983
metaphor and maybe i'm thinking too deeply about it to give my life meaning because,0.086198054
i've spent so much time thinking about movies and the arts and the meaning it,0.06073218
has for people um it's just a beaver of a movie dude and if you,0.18613651
don't know what i mean watch a documentary about a beaver it changes its environment,0.09666926
if it if it wants something it goes i'm going to use my skills which,0.087707974
is non-down trees and making dams to literally change the environment and flood the forest,0.074686676
so i can catch fish stuff like that it's literally it's crazy i don't know,0.2620652
it's got everything and i love that idea that it's hopeful and kind and one,0.040661655
of these documentaries i watched it's like advantageous for them to make a little compartment,0.14985771
in their damn for muskrats because they take care of like bugs and other things,0.8573599
like that and they like live in a symbiotic relationship and i was like oh,0.094611615
that's just like that's like it see i'm used to i usually use the food,0.07427879
metaphor for people to take my classes about you know kind of schlocky crap movies,0.794439
that hollywood pumps out a lot of times they're like candy bars they're fun to,0.10702673
watch you eat them you're satisfied for a few minutes and whatever and you ye,0.40178025
get some energy but then and you know it's actually killing you and rotting your,0.8538402
teeth and ruining your organs and it's not giving you a lot of nutrition um,0.6611988
but sometimes when you eat a big you know nice meal that has the greens,0.14980935
and the meats and the or proteins we'll say for non-meat eaters and you know,0.094719656
and all the vitamins and minerals you need maybe you don't like eating the brussels,0.14982957
sprouts but it's gonna sustain you for much longer and it's gonna give you like,0.0977905
some actual nourishment and better you um and i truly feel that way and if,0.08542016
that sounds elitist i don't care i don't care anymore whatever find them i'm elitist,0.2402059
about movies and stuff sorry you know whatever i don't know what to say hey,0.09700199
let's go through the song list so there's 12 basically i might be a little,0.06563978
bit off because there's some kind of iconic kind of medleys i guess you could,0.17090157
call it uh songs but i just want to go through them to help people,0.18534634
who might have to write a paper about this here's a little help these aren't,0.1558649
the exact names but uh a fit as a fiddle and ready for love that,0.11562213
should be fit as a fiddle and ready to ask if you want to keep,0.15071529
the alliteration going which would be fun but that's essentially what it means and it's,0.06432129
during that opening sequence on the red carpet during a flashback and it's like the,0.10869353
violin vaudeville song and it's awesome oh my god they're them working together um uh,0.07817913
i almost said fred astaire uh what what the hell's his name oh my god,0.35141137
i am fired gene kelly jesus yeah gene kelly and uh o'connors there have just,0.3727836
like such great chemistry and they can just like move in sync so well it's,0.04447577
great um yeah that one that one's amazing then all i do is dream about,0.068158664
you that's when um we meet kathy and she jumps out of the cake and,0.15120691
she's doing like the flapper kind of dance that kind of stuff which is so,0.24072275
fun and then and then there's the then we get our first uh uh cosmo,0.11563437
brown song and make him laugh which looks like the most painful dance sequence next,0.304513
to that one the jump jive one with the uh nichols brothers or whatever they're,0.15305212
like jumping down the stairs landing in splits this is just about as bad and,0.18345648
so he severely he used to smoke four packs of cigarettes a day so this,0.15142627
is really hardened and he was like in the hospital after doing this sequence and,0.1070164
like something went wrong with the film so they had to do it again and,0.0747448
he did it and it's so badass it's like jackie chan or something he's like,0.35176882
destroying his body just to make you laugh and hopefully when you watch this in,0.6364068
your dorm you did laugh because he deserves it because he did this like 80,0.40913296
years ago and it's still awesome and even the award-winning lotted musicals of nowadays look,0.059539597
like a comedy joke like a satire about how to make a you know it,0.21001816
looks like like we're not actually gonna dance but this would look this is roughly,0.12063652
what it would look like if we had talent you know and this they're like,0.08893274
throwing and he does the run up the wall in the backflip it looks like,0.17868318
special effects and it's all real and they're not even like messing with the camera,0.13140975
speed or anything anyway then there's the i got uh uh uh a uh i,0.26160756
got a feeling you're foolin i gotta be you foolin what i gotta feel when,0.8355208
you're foolin uh that's the one where it's like a kind of in uh beautiful,0.82109076
girls is basically the scene yeah uh and it's like a fashion video video film,0.27201945
or whatever showing how talking pictures are gonna evolve or whatever and one time i'll,0.06294459
tell you one time when i was much younger i took magical mushrooms and don't,0.07570727
do that but i did it i was forced at gunpoint i was much younger,0.21090025
this is like at least 15 18 months ago and uh i watched this movie,0.10901027
on a high resolution screen on blu-ray like this close to it and during that,0.06853602
sequence where there's all that pink glitter in the background the guys yells to the,0.07792854
bullhorn i was like movies are alive hey odie just entered i'll put on her,0.39305398
camera odie going up so there you go odie's in here now you can all,0.20335448
yay she's probably gonna make a little bed and lie down good for her okay,0.357174
so anyway um that one's awesome and then we talked about uh maybe we shouldn't,0.07428776
go through all of these that may be the problem with doing psychedelic drugs is,0.18035328
that you lose your brain a lot now i have no idea what i'm talking,0.664119
about okay uh life was a song you came along you were meant for me,0.2307947
that whole seek that sequence is great that's the one on the sound stage i,0.060038615
was talking about that's like la la land and then we go on to moses,0.06548357
supposes which is so exuberant and then good morning that's their first of all three,0.07759772
of them together it's so classic uh good morning that's when they realize hey wait,0.08493878
we make it a musical um and then there's broadway melody i don't like that,0.063992396
well i was singing in the rain obviously after that which is like the second,0.05731428
plot point peak thing and it's like so hopeful for the future and then there's,0.05131466
broadway melody which is another that's kind of a tangent the movie goes on i,0.15291585
think it's probably one of the weaker parts of the movie although this movie is,0.099623665
a 10 out of 10. that's the one part and then it's the shows like,0.055592615
the dancing cavalier which is what the song the movie becomes uh when it becomes,0.15295243
a musical the would you song and uh it's good that one's not super funny,0.13090397
either this is the one like lull in the movie not that it's much of,0.05433557
a low you know this i i to take one little point off this movie,0.18169601
you know at some point but then they're singing the rainbow prize which is done,0.044240892
you know whenever we reveal that kathy is doing the voice and then he sings,0.15221114
you are my lucky star and it's good full circle because at the end they,0.08223641
kiss in front of us singing the rain poster and then you're like is this,0.12245363
the movie and it's like it's like inception that's great um i like when lena,0.12395765
loman says i make more money than calvin coolidge combined that doesn't make any sense,0.11670745
but i love it oh god make more money than cabbage school is combined uh,0.120804355
okay so anyway that was my run through basically the plot and the songs and,0.106191486
what i think it means i don't want to give you ad too much more,0.15493613
because again if you have to write a paper and you just pick stanley donan,0.24607517
