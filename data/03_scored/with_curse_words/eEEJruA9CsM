well hello there welcome back to the channel my name is james and here at,0.052595355
20th and 21st movies we are about all things cinema so i'm really excited today,0.055288695
to share with you my thoughts on a movie that i recently had a chance,0.09819067
to check out this is a film that i picked up as part of the,0.07964187
november 2020 criterion collection sale at barnes noble and this is a title that came,0.06423317
out on november the 24th and it is none other than the irishman this is,0.14913553
a film starring robert de niro al pacino and joe pesci and directed by martin,0.04061124
scorsese and the irishman came out on netflix in 2019 and it's really the culmination,0.15116756
of a project that mark scorsese and robert de niro have been kicking around for,0.24225625
years that they had planned to make and they finally got around to making it,0.054891244
in 2019 and i'm so glad that they did because this is a fantastic film,0.0734294
i thoroughly enjoyed it so i'm looking forward to sharing with you my thoughts on,0.16584685
the irishman so the irishman is mark scorsese's fourth italian mob film following up from,0.06839689
mean streets in 1973 goodfellas in 1990 casino from 1995 and now in 2019 coming,0.043984663
out with the irishman and i have to tell you of all the films in,0.24050608
martin scorsese's filmography and i think he's made over 25 movies in in his time,0.08800388
he's most famous i think for these type of mob type films and mark scorsese,0.28271526
brings such a wonderful artistry to these types of films that i really really enjoy,0.12291999
so as i said i really enjoyed this film i'm not going to get into,0.15040389
how this movie compares to good fellas or how it compares to any of his,0.1527855
other previous movies i don't really think that does justice to this film i'm not,0.09142944
gonna say it's better or worse than any of those films i'm just gonna take,0.316412
this movie on face value on his own merits and based on that this is,0.18257907
a really really good movie i thoroughly enjoyed it it was 209 minutes so just,0.102725945
under three and a half hours it never felt over long it's definitely a long,0.07945846
movie don't get me wrong but it never felt like it overstayed its welcome i,0.17735328
felt like every aspect of the film was so nicely developed and really played into,0.04340221
the story that was being told that i just felt like it all fit and,0.061047465
it all worked and there wasn't really much in the way of of areas of,0.03938717
this film that i would recommend trimming or cutting at all so the irishman tells,0.44537604
the story of frank sheeran who's played by robert de niro in this movie so,0.13947165
frank is a truck driver who gets involved with mafia crime lord russell buffalina who's,0.45196468
played by joe pesci in this film and eventually frank not only works for joe,0.076963805
pesci's character russell but he also ends up getting involved with jimmy hoffa who is,0.1174791
played by al pacino in this film so he's doing work for russell buffalino he's,0.17494707
doing work for jimmy hoffa and he's doing all these these mob related crimes the,0.28031832
movie is based on the book i heard you paint houses by charles brant which,0.06407943
recounts the true life story of frank sheeran who got involved with jimmy hoffa and,0.18451358
claims to have murdered jimmy hoffa in 1975. so this movie tells the story of,0.35565066
frank sheeran in flashbacks so at the beginning of the movie you'll see frank sheeran,0.15000217
in a nursing home he's very old at this time and he's in a wheelchair,0.35917693
and he's beginning to tell the story of his life and how he got involved,0.075986885
in the mob and how he raised his family and everything that he went through,0.10306675
working with russell buffalino working with jimmy hoffa and all the events that ultimately led,0.14138405
up to him basically you know taking out jimmy hoffa so the events of this,0.13041696
film take place over a very long period of time from 1949 1950s to around,0.087057084
the year 2000 so you're talking about 50 years that this film is covering and,0.10703331
so as a result these actors are being shown at different ages across that 50-year,0.06631797
period so by the time martin scorsese got around to making this movie it became,0.09774607
apparent to him that de niro pacino and pesci these guys were getting too old,0.37326425
to play their younger selves in makeup and so they had to employ industrial light,0.08474496
magic ilm to apply some groundbreaking new technology around digital d aging so in this,0.08989871
movie you will see robert de niro's character frank sharon as young as around the,0.122547925
age of 35 all the way up to his early 80s you're also seeing joe,0.09704697
pesci's character and now pacino's character at various ages along the way as young as,0.016742695
their 40s all the way up to the 70s and 80s as well and the,0.047626473
digital de-aging effects that are used by industrial light and magic are really groundbreaking and,0.07042294
there's a really nice supplement on this disc that goes into that that you really,0.1620045
ought to check out i think that's some technology that's probably going to be used,0.07990286
in other films and it was employed really well in the irishman so there are,0.12510107
some scenes where the effects don't work quite as well as others but as a,0.09484145
whole i think the technology worked extremely well i think the team in industrial light,0.032920584
and magic did an amazing job portraying these actors at different ages throughout the course,0.062338367
of this film so i absolutely love the acting in this film i think de,0.099031106
niro and pacino absolutely turned in great performances but i was most impressed by joe,0.108457886
pesci's performance in this film as russell buffalino i mean the way that he portrayed,0.10988569
this stone cold calm cool collected mob boss was such an incredible and interesting contrast,0.1329034
to the tommy devito character he portrayed in goodfellas you know and that is a,0.05839772
really cool contrast that i enjoyed about this film is his performance as well as,0.0798956
the performances of all the supporting characters at harvey keitel playing angelo bruno you had,0.057092447
ray romano playing bill buffalino who was related to russell buffalino he had bobby canavella,0.21551615
playing skinny razor he had stephanie kurt supa as irene sheeran who was frank's wife,0.11524658
one of his wives and he had catherine narducci as carrie buffalino who was the,0.3469311
wife of russell buffalino so the supporting cast of this film was absolutely fantastic and,0.15274689
i really really enjoyed not only the performances of de niro and pacino and pesci,0.15994202
but the supporting cast around them really made this a very satisfying picture to watch,0.07978572
so overall i really enjoyed this film i enjoyed robert de niro's performance says frank,0.25625578
sheeran i really love seeing this story of frank sheeran and his life unfold throughout,0.23996791
the course of this movie is seeing his involvement with both russell buffalino and jimmy,0.24137136
hoffa and seeing the effect that the mob life had on on frank's life and,0.30721486
on the life of his family and his relationship with his daughters and with his,0.095870614
wives and seeing how that wore on him over the course of the film as,0.06610664
he aged and got older was i think one of the biggest impacts of this,0.11211053
film for me and then also seeing the other characters such as seeing pacino as,0.06833722
he portrayed jimmy hoffa and the complexity that he brought to that character in that,0.09592073
performance and then seeing russell buffalino was played by joe pesci and just seeing him,0.09983686
play this more quiet and reserved character such an incredible contrast to the tommy devito,0.088385776
character he played in goodfellas i just thought that was so fascinating to watch and,0.06181361
i think for me that was probably my favorite aspect of this film seeing russell,0.14974968
buffalino seeing pesci's performance in that role in addition to de niro and pacino and,0.06421385
the incredible supporting cast of this film just for me made this movie an incredibly,0.15183258
satisfying experience i don't think it's a perfect movie i don't think it's even scorsese's,0.123135515
best film i would probably put goodfellas in that category but i don't really compare,0.08846499
this movie to goodfellas or any other mob movie just taking this movie on its,0.1203471
own merits this is a great film and i thoroughly enjoyed it and i highly,0.07971123
highly recommend it so you know for me this this is a a great film,0.08310153
that i i just thoroughly enjoyed all right so from a presentation standpoint how does,0.13065779
this movie look and sound on criterion blu-ray in short it looks and sounds great,0.15072481
this is a new 4k digital master it's approved by director martin scorsese the dolby,0.12492004
atmos soundtrack so this movie on blu-ray with that nice 4k digital master it looked,0.16641183
great on my 4k tv with my played on my 4k ultra hd player now,0.08862198
this is not a 4k ultra hd disc but played on a 4k tv on,0.16556944
a nice 4k blu-ray player from sony it's gonna up convert that image and bring,0.067613736
it to a near 4k quality so when i compare how this looks to the,0.09340239
netflix presentation which was a 4k streamed dolby vision hdr experience the netflix version looks,0.13661806
a little bit darker compared to this criterion blu-ray and the colors look slightly punchier,0.1539652
on the netflix version but when you compare them side by side i think the,0.08226989
images are very comparable again the netflix is a little bit on the darker side,0.1536104
from a definition standpoint i really couldn't tell much of a difference i think they,0.055455342
both look very sharp very well defined and overall i think the images are very,0.07596587
strong i think because this is physical media and it is a really nice blu-ray,0.11479513
disc it's going to give you a more stable image generally speaking depending on your,0.088335864
on your internet connection you're not going to run into any buffering obviously on a,0.18273994
on a physical disk versus the buffering you may run into on a netflix stream,0.09971208
so it depends on the viewer i think the viewing and the audio experiences are,0.03879701
comparable either way so there's no preferred outlet for me i think the netflix stream,0.11351964
looks great and i think this criterion collection disc looks great as well so overall,0.15736362
from a presentation standpoint the irishman on criterion collection blu-ray looks and sounds great so,0.09945306
as far as supplements overall criterion did a really nice job with this edition of,0.08020287
course you've got the nice 4k digital master and the dolby atmos that's on the,0.08823885
disc itself you've got a newly edited round table conversation with scorsese and robert de,0.11563719
niro al pacino and joe pesci which was a very nice conversation seeing all them,0.16973346
together it was recorded in 2019 you have a making the irishman which is a,0.11564856
new program that that has scorsese in it the lead actors and several other key,0.068547614
players in the production which was really really good and you've also got gangsters requiem,0.25159118
which is a nice really nice video essay by film critic farron smith neem that,0.06494575
really talks about how the irishman tells the story of frank sheeran's life and you,0.15504368
have anatomy of a scene which deals with the french hearing appreciation night scene from,0.07947626
the movie which was very good and then you have a really cool supplement on,0.10287964
here called the evolution of digital d aging which is a program that talks about,0.11048956
the visual effects work from industrial light and magic and that was a very interesting,0.056917835
watch because it really shows you the technology that went into the work that they,0.05580263
did to make robert de niro al pacino and joe pesci look their younger selves,0.18582532
throughout this film and i just thought that was an incredibly fascinating fascinating special to,0.082720526
watch you also have an interview with jimmy hoffa the real life jimmy hoffa on,0.31089434
this disc as well so overall the supplements on this disc are phenomenal this is,0.1064179
a great release by criterion from a supplements department so i highly recommend it and,0.05369163
then of course this is a digi pack so as you see here you open,0.19453824
it up you get pictures of the principal characters here of course you've got robert,0.056038145
de niro al pacino and joe pesci here very nicely pictured inside you see the,0.15455073
two discs so you've got the disc that has a movie on it and the,0.15263002
second disc has all the supplements so that's very nice and then you've got a,0.06555298
nice book here that says i heard you paint houses i heard you paint houses,0.056131594
is a phrase that's used throughout this movie and it's the name of the book,0.05688429
upon which this movie is based and it's also a euphemism that's used in this,0.09999206
movie that basically is a phrase that they use to talk about the mob work,0.082734086
that they're doing the mob killings and other work that they're doing they describe it,0.20534661
as i heard you paint houses so i thought that was interesting and of course,0.02898354
you've got some really nice pictures in here from the production nice essays on the,0.14746757
movie so i think that's very nice and overall just a really strong digi-pack you,0.26557413
know presentation of this criterion collection edition so really a great supplement package all around,0.088807315
for criterion all right so there you have it those are my thoughts on this,0.10445144
wonderful film the irishman starring robert de niro al pacino and joe pesci and directed,0.13262816
by martin scorsese this is a wonderful film i highly recommend it it is a,0.07841779
long watch it's nearly three and a half hours long so you may want to,0.0725242
break it up in in segments and take it a piece at a time maybe,0.10078402
take it an hour an hour and a half and then an hour at a,0.061306868
time and just sort of absorb it slowly over a couple of nights but this,0.07141772
is a wonderful film i thoroughly enjoyed it and i really appreciate the fact that,0.05391818
martin scorsese was able to bring de niro and pesci back together again and was,0.11847293
able to also have the opportunity to direct al pacino for the first time so,0.057583343
just bringing those legendary stars together for sort of one last hurrah together i think,0.06440167
was something i really appreciate about this movie and i think it's something that film,0.13848132
fans will cherish for a long time so i highly recommend this title on blu-ray,0.3078263
