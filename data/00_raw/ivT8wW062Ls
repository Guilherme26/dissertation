what's going on people Mike see town here where I'm gonna be discussing the new Jordan Peele film us before I get into that I want to say that I reviewed this on the frames-per-second podcast so make sure you guys go check that out link will be down there but I also wanted to make a video about this - jumping into it us is the second horror film from Jordan Peele third film in general as he also did Keanu but he was also known for his jokey and Peele but I've never actually seen that show I didn't know anything about this guy until he did get out which I loved which I also reviewed so I'll link that down there as well but because I love get out so much I had really really high expectations for this one and before we get into this review there will be spoilers so if you have not seen the movie turn this off go watch the movie and then come back so us is the story of Adelaide played by Lupita Nyong'o her husband Gabe played by Winston Duke and their two children Jason and Zora they go up to Santa Cruz California to their vacation home to kind of chill out but while there they encountered their doppelgangers and a whole lot of crazy  happens I look like I need to tell you the entire story if you saw it you know it if you didn't see it you need to go watch it but I think the main part of the story evolved around who the doppelgangers or the tethered are the tethered or group that lives underground they're in some way tied to their above-ground counterparts and what the above-ground twins do is mimicked by the tethered no matter how weird or awkward it is later in the film we come to find out that the tethered are a scientific experiment in cloning that's why we see so many rabbits and at first I thought it was because rabbits were some of the first animals to be cloned but I was actually wrong about that I now think it's just because rabbits reproduce so rapidly so it makes sense to use them especially if we're talking about feeding the other tethers anyway the scientists moved on from cloning animals and were semi-successful in cloning the humans they were identical counterparts to their above-ground twins except they weren't able to talk never really explains why but I kind of have an idea we'll get to that later but at some point the tethered decide that they're gonna go up of ground because they're tired of living below ground and living a relatively shitty life while their above-ground twins are living great lives so they decide to come above Brown and start murdering their twins with scissors so let me say I loved this movie while I was excited to see it I was also a bit nervous I didn't want this to be drastically worse then get out and then Jordan peel is looked at as a one-hit wonder and then his career within horror movies is over but even outside of looking at the symbolism which we'll get into I thought this was a very entertaining movie it had plenty of drama it had some comedy but it was it was tense and it definitely kept you on the edge of your seat was the perfect film no it was not I didn't have a new small issues with it if he listened to the podcast you'll know that one of my issues with the movie was game the father he was incredibly annoying throughout this movie and I understand that he was written this way on purpose as a way to prop up Lupita nyong'o's character or maybe even to prop up black women in general um but after shooting the podcast and driving home and thinking about it more I now realized that he was kind of representing how women are treated in horror movies they're looked at as dumb they're looked at as useless as pointless and this kind of made me think about the part where he's kind of trying to sexualize the situation by laying on the bed and kind of spreading his legs yeah that's what women would do in horror movies you know and I was thinking before that it was too much that it was too obvious that he's this this big buffoon who gets hit in the leg one time and he spends the rest of the movie kind of whining and crying and crawling on the ground making dumb jokes at completely inopportune times and yeah that's how women are in horror movies I feel like Jordan Peele was giving us a taste of our own medicine and yes it was extremely annoying but now I see that that was probably the whole point so I feel like he did his job there and that part no longer bothers me I also feel like they should have left out the part that definitively tells us that a delay was switched out I think could have left that to us to figure out you know one example I gave on podcast was Deckard from Blade Runner you know the movie gives slight implications that may imply that that Deckard is actually a replicant but it doesn't say for sure so this gives us years of wandering and rewatching and discussing and it contributes to the cult status of that film and I think without giving us the answer so definitively the idea of Adelaide being a tethered would give us the same feeling that Deckard being a replicant did but there's another idea that wasn't definitively given that I feel like could give us that same feeling but we'll get to that in a minute my only other issue was the impracticality of certain things like how would cloning Adelaide and Gabe result in their kids being exact clones it would be different if Adelaide and her clone red hadn't actually given birth to the kids but they did the kids weren't cloned later on so it didn't really make sense but those are extremely small gripes because I'm totally fine with suspending disbelief for within horror movies especially if I really enjoyed the film now let's talk about the details of the film so I did love this movie when I first left the theater I was kind of mad on the whole thing I thought it was cool and I thought it was a fun ride but it didn't really click I didn't really get it I had to think about it long and hard on my ride home and that's when things started to come together and the more they came together the more I loved this movie once I started to think about the details of the story my mind started going crazy so we all know that Adelaide was switched out with her underground clone so when you think back to the beginning how when young Adelaide was found she wouldn't talk and that's because the tethered don't talk Adelaide had to learn how to talk to you she also tells Kitty the mom of the white family they're friends with that she has a hard time talking to people again because The Temper don't talk even though you'd think that she'd kind of be over that by now as she's been above-ground for what we could guess would be at least 20 years also there's the scene in the car where she's teaching her son Jason how to snap along - I got five on it I noticed while watching that that she was totally off beat and I thought that maybe it was just me being too critical and that it wasn't a big deal but it is actually a big deal because she's offbeat due to the fact that she's not of this world her her wiring isn't like ours so even though she's able to pretend with certain things other things just don't connect for another thing that I mentioned on the frame for second podcast review about this is my idea that Jason the son was also a tethered I can't say for certain but many things this movie gave me this impression once I started to think back on it first off when he's on the beach he's not building a sandcastle he's building a sand tunnel and it didn't connect at first but it does once the movies over and you look back at everything just like when Jason says certain things like kiss my anus and is his parents are like where the hell did you get that from and then they say he's been acting weird since the previous summer but they simply think it's because his grandmother died I think it's because he was switched out that previous summer there's also the thing about the magic trick toy that he has he says he remembers playing with it but he doesn't remember what it does and that's because he doesn't know but because his above-ground twin was playing with it he sort of knows how it works but when we look at Jason's tethered his face is all burned up and I think that's because while this Jason was above-ground playing with the little toy his twin was below ground mimicking him but he was playing with matches and he ends up burning his face I also think another indication of Jason being switched out is he's the first to say it's us when the tennard show up he seems to be the least freaked out at first you know Adelaide is so weirded out because I think she doesn't really remember that she's a tethered because it happened so long ago she it starts to come back to her later on in the movie but it's been so recent with Jason that he knows the whole time but at the end when Adelaide looks back at Jason and she gives him that kind of sinister smile that kind of tells the audience that she's a tethered Jason doesn't say anything he just lowers his mask kind of indicating that he's going back to masking the fact that he's a tethered to now let's talk a bit about the symbolism in this movie the first big one that we see is the homeless guy holding the sign that says Jeremiah 11 you know there are many interpretations of this verse depending on which version of the Bible that you're reading but I found this one and I think it seems to fit the movie the most behold I'm bringing disaster and suffering on them which they will not be able to escape though they cry to me I will not listen to them the interesting thing is the other places the 11:11 appear the attack also seems to happen at 11:11 p.m. but one of them that kind of me up was during the fair in 1986 when the fathers playing whack-a-mole the guy that hands in the ticket is wearing a black flag shirt so me being a nerdy punk of course I noticed that and I'm like no that's pretty cool kind of like a random reference until later we see one of the real light twins in the Tyler family the white family they're wearing a black flag t-shirt and I noticed that and it took me forever to figure out why you know I know a bit about black flag but I was never a big fan of theirs so I was looking at songs and song titles trying to figure this out until I looked at the logo it had a huge dub moment for bars 11:11 such a dope little nugget for Jordan Peele to throw in there the significance of eleven eleven outside the verse itself saying that the tethered are bringing evil onto the world and they won't be stopped I think the number eleven eleven is obviously a take on the whole twin thing you know eleven eleven is the same no matter how you flip it the scissors I knew there had to be a reason as to why they were using scissors to attack people but I couldn't figure it out until the scene where red cuts the paper dolls then it dawned on me that the scissors were a representation of severing the above ground people from their tethered twins that's why they specifically use the scissors to kill them this is them breaking that connection between the tethered and the above-ground people now why they specifically killed people by stabbing them in the necks especially with the Tyler family that part kind of confused me so if anybody has any ideas on that please drop a comment down there Hands Across America so this was an 80s campaign that I'm actually old enough to remember it was geared at raising money for the hungry and the homeless and in US red used this idea of Hands Across America a way of fixing the issue of the tethered being the hungry and the homeless as they have no home since they've been living in the tunnels and eating nothing but raw rabid while their counterparts live above ground eating whatever they want chud so there were a few movies that were seen at the very beginning of the film if you play it close enough attention chug being one of my favorite horror movies that one jumped out at me you know judge is a story of these creatures who live underground and homeless people are fed to them we're laying to the idea that the tethered being homeless and living underground I kind of think it's obvious as to why that movie is a big reference so what do the tethered represent to me they represent impoverished disenfranchised or marginalized people you know us could also be seen as u.s. United States Adelaide even says when they're asked who they are you know she says we're Americans the tethered represent this idea of these people who have been here as long as we have but we treat them like others like outsiders the same way immigrants black folks gays or any marginalized group is treated which gives the movie a whole new meaning when we consider who we're supposed to root for in this movie are these people really coming to the surface just to hurt people with no reason like the media tells us in real life and in this film or is this justifiable revenge why don't the tethered talk well disenfranchised people typically don't have a voice until someone from outside of their group is chosen to speak for them we have to remember red is from above ground she's technically an outsider to them so the fact that she's the one that speaks for them I think it says a lot I could totally keep going but I'm gonna stop there I'm just gonna say again that I loved this movie I like to get out more because I related to it more but I still thought that US was an amazing twist on the horror genre the reason being is he has a voice that is missed in horror for the most part horror has always had socially conscious films Night of the Living Dead and Candyman are a few but Jordan Peele is presenting a narrative that solely missed you know the horror movies with with black people as the center who are not based on stipulations or stereotypes I think that's really really dope as our horror movies that really make you think about real life without giving everything to you on an easy platter so I support this fully so make sure you guys go see this movie then be sure to come back and let me know what you guys thought of it and let me know if I missed any of the references or any of the symbolism drop some comments down there in the comments section but yeah that's it as usual thank you for looking thank you for loving thank you for being you and I'll see you guys next time all right peace out boy [Music] you [Music]
