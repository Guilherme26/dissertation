now the Irishman is supposed to be Netflix's movie right,0.10263158
it's three and a half hours long it has a hundred and sixty million dollar budget it has fancy new D aging VFX front and center in a year where that's all the rage right some of Hollywood's most legendary talent and a sophisticated debut at the New York Film Festival,0.061411988
in fact they even had the press screening at Alice Tully Hall where the film will debut this evening,0.018939398
and they hardly ever do that for press they cram us into the wall to read,0.108694494
so that was that was real nice,0.06485383
and because I think they wanted everyone including the critics to feel that,0.056130406
this is a movie Scorsese lobbied hard but failed to get it a theatrical wide release but the theater owners still really hate Netflix because they won't do,0.14993955
at least like a two-month window before digital release I think this is only gonna be like two weeks right theaters before you can watch it on streaming,0.10131903
but Netflix is rumored to have actually bought the Paris theater here in New York City a prestige venue for this very movie,0.04680503
but ironically I think this is actually better suited for streaming and I think that's actually the case with Romo as well both are a long slog like wow like remember how a lot of you wrote me and said like I had a hard time getting through Romo Grace and I felt at the end it was worth it,0.10566973
some of you agreed with me,0.09446506
some of you didn't some of you never made it to the end of Romo,0.15174301
and I think it's a similar situation with the Irishman,0.072976336
now I think that because this is an English it's in color right and it has Hollywood actors with the more commercial storytelling,0.074689515
and performances it'll probably be better received by audiences overall than Romo was right,0.07560446
I think more people will get to the end of this movie now as for award season,0.090304665
I don't know I think that its strongest,0.24100557
bet is a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Joe Pesci who is wonderfully understated,0.08723739
here,0.05344117
I was really impressed with his work,0.056962375
it's in stark contrast to his other iconic Scorsese performance in good which he already want an Oscar for,0.089465156
so I don't know if he's gonna win an Oscar here again for the same director but I'm very maybe because it's such a different role he could and also Pesci was uh nominated for Scorsese's Raging Bull,0.1550348
so there's a very not only is there are good awards history,0.045269616
there voters love that kind of stuff but it's a very good actor director collaboration indeed Scorsese actually looks after a number of actors,0.0782548
but this you know maybe this being just so different than Pesci's iconic persona right,0.104017384
it was funny in fact to sometimes watch them cuz it's so long and someone sometimes it's not that good we're gonna talk about that sometimes it's very good,0.18208557
but in some of the slower moments I was like it's so funny,0.09155301
that's Harry from home alone hilarious he's Joe Pesci favorite character in the movie he's so adorable well they you know but it towards the end when he was like a grandpa's,0.13050382
I was this one to go the whole movie I wanted to scope and give him a hug,0.067011714
he was so awesome,0.07292906
and he had like a cool look he actually had glasses a little bit like my new glasses maybe that maybe that's why I felt a kinship with him alright,0.10084908
so obviously the big question is how successful is the D aging VFX right which is supposedly responsible for the sky-high budget although I think a lot of people got paid big time here talk about the mob to do it this on Netflix although you know nobody else really wanted to foot,0.12474635
the budget right,0.047572877
I believe that was the that was a situation although seeing the movie I wouldn't paid one hundred and sixty million dollars for this either as speaking of the aging as I said in my trailer reaction for this movie I find it ironic that if this technology existed back in the 1970s DeNiro never would have gotten his big breakout role as young Vito Corleone Marlon Brando just would have played the role himself,0.06591302
although I don't know Marlon Brando would have gone along with this he'd be like no,0.18217488
thank you,0.039406788
especially,0.050187077
maybe after he saw how it turned out when they showed him the test he'd be like it doesn't even work,0.097646475
I don't really think that it does in some shots it does,0.22959867
but then it's weird cuz,0.13072687
the very next shot,0.53490317
you're like did you turn off the D aging and they're like it's just not as clean some shots,0.507098
what do you want from us so De Niro and Pesci here play the younger versions of themselves and they cover quite a long their lives acting-wise,0.15043862
I think they do that very well but technology wise well the face D,0.1318496
aging is again somewhat effective,0.075910375
all Scorsese accomplishes is putting young faces on older bodies both in how they look and how they move,0.14809637
I don't know,0.1431935
if you saw the reason I didn't notice it as much in Captain Marvel but the recent honest trailer for that pointed out that Sam Jackson even types like like an older gentleman despite the D aging on his face,0.11798548
but here you really notice it,0.070083134
particularly the first D H seen they have De Niro and Pesci working on a truck engine and in the close-ups there their hands are noticeably the hands of you know guys who are as old as of Pesci and De Niro actually are so that was it was just it was just jarring and you're like,0.1207297
I don't know if this was worth it,0.13340683
I mean they could have just dyed their hair black as I think they did to some degree and it would have been the same thing but thankfully De Niro Pesci and mr.,0.3691651
Al Pacino are legendary for being their own best special effects,0.14837624
and what keeps this movie interesting throughout are their incredible performances not just incredible but it's interesting to see all three of them play roles that are so different than how we are famous for knowing them right,0.052810267
so De Niro is differential right,0.10594622
a soldier instead of a general and the army analogy to the mob is used I think very effectively subtly but I think effectively the movies very subtle in many regards,0.08172607
I wonder how much people will actually pick up about what it's saying I picked up a lot,0.08973973
and I still found it kind of boring in places all right,0.22091694
so Pesci is calm collected and a respected leader,0.0721084
I know and Pacino is totally out of control but also a total lovable softie ah he was so sweet but by the way his supposedly emphasis on supposedly Midwestern accent was all over the place sometimes it decided to show up to say sometimes it didn't I'd be like just forget it al you can't do it consistently,0.06985347
so forget it,0.03781798
I guess there's I forget the accents,0.057127442
forget the D aging technology,0.087978914
this is just a very good play which is I think is also good way to sit smallest good streaming show,0.09307326
that's a good way to describe it,0.0538593
I also appreciated the history of the mob Hoffa and the Kennedys you know that's not very rarely delved into,0.08322131
and as the movie continually points out,0.067069106
many people today don't even know who Jimmy Hoffa is and I think cuz they're focusing on how uh instead of perhaps the Kennedys part of the story,0.09844745
that's very much,0.05341782
in the background and not until like the second half for the last third of the last hour or so or the movie I don't know how riveted it will be for people who aren't into history,0.06978355
but I like history,0.027070984
so I thought that stuff was cool,0.06994757
I also like the subtle revelation again sometimes the movie might be too subtle for its own good,0.0612489
but I like this connection that banks back in the day couldn't get involved in gambling,0.0737608
so they couldn't invest in casinos and such fare so that left that left an opening for the mob but today of course banks and all businesses are involved in all kinds of shady dealings with often government involvement,0.067022
so there's no business left for the mob,0.14336409
and as I said that's really interesting,0.048108146
when you think about it,0.06505615
so I liked that takeaway there also as is usually the case with this type of movie plenty of little and big life lessons to learn and some scenes sprinkled throughout as I said the movie has some serious laws,0.10091989
but there are scenes here and there with almost Tarantino level dialogue and shoot again far not throughout not consistent,0.21148711
but there were a lot of scenes where people in the audience was laughing very hard myself included very good De Niro and Pesci also shine showing their characters towards the end of their lives the passage of time physically mentally and this is a zinger emotionally I was pretty blown away the final few scenes are incredibly moving really I mean I've told you before you want to open your movie strong and you want to end your movie strong,0.22868156
I think the movie did kind of open strong open strong but it ended I'm sure that it ended very strong,0.057363193
and I think that'll help how people remember it again,0.034171857
if you get you'll get to the end of a Scorsese movie it might take you a few days,0.15802832
but you'll get there and I thought that the ending was so moving that I think it could end up getting De Niro and acting nomination as well,0.08794544
I don't know about a win,0.10447649
the passage of time was very convincing and he does have some really strong emotional,0.053937048
scenes like really like a gift to an actor even though I thought at the beginning he was hamming it up a little bit,0.18691675
so I don't think he's a strong contender,0.15434231
but I think he's in the mix but speaking of senior citizens the movie is set up like you're visiting grandpa the senior at the Senior Center and boy to see you have a story to tell you which is an excellent framing device,0.07455096
it's a,0.049287707
it's really a very clever framing device and it's very well set up but you know what's not so great choosing to have the pacing and the energy of a story that grandpa tells you I mean as I said the movie is super slow and feels super long,0.10639246
and I actually almost dozed off,0.0593866
I got very little sleep last night,0.24226955
but still if it had been a really good movie I would have paid attention,0.087998666
but I was like really fighting to stay awake towards the end of the second hour whoa I mean it really was like spending a few hours at your grandparents house because if again the pacing the energy the sex the actors it was it was it was office a little surreal in that regard and also speaking of The Godfather Part two again that's also three plus hours I recently watched it,0.15158783
for the Labor Day weekend went down to Little Italy had some dinner then watched The Godfather Part two which has a lot of scene,0.12285041
and seems a little italy fabulous evening,0.086106986
and I was riveted to that movie the entire time never lost a step loved it,0.13704938
and while this is a very long movie oddly Scorsese has made it a very small movie in scope the cinematography the locations none of it warrants the big screen,0.06406448
in fact this could easily be a four episode streaming series on Netflix which is what it basically is also,0.05535985
well it's a different story,0.04338215
the movie is so similar to The Godfather films the first two and Goodfellas etc with the same actors,0.090802886
but that also keeps them it keeps it from feeling fresh and new the movie is very funny again as I said and has some surprisingly fun turns from Steven Graham who we all know plays a very good mobster but also Ray Romano was used incredibly well here I love gray Romano here and there are some cameos really great cameos sprinkled throughout a lot of times like oh look who it is oh look look I love that person awesome,0.11141051
now obviously in a movie like this the women's roles,0.41461068
aren't great,0.12810726
although Goodfellas of course had a pretty strong female role,0.19225124
and I guess uh Diane Keaton was so annoying and the Godfather movies it's a little bit hard to include her as well,0.30676574
but here I thought Katherine Narducci as Pesci's wife made an impression and it was nice to see dascha Polanco from orange is the new black even if it was just for one scene she stood out though good for her she made the most of it,0.17991869
so I definitely watch the Irishman I just stream it,0.05929103
and as I said you might might want to make it a two-night event you might be like no grace,0.2598137
I want to power through it,0.0844842
I'm gonna watch this whole thing in one night cuz,0.14831151
it's a Scorsese movie damn it,0.716355
but I bet you you fall asleep and you'll have to watch it the next night unless you start it like speaking of senior citizens you start it like a four o'clock,0.21224244
maybe then you could do it maybe you'd be a good after Sunday afternoon movie which is how I recommended you watch Romo by the way I watched Romo myself on a rainy Sunday,0.1961313
I was like let's try this again,0.08294009
because the credits were so long I'd finished,0.11563562
my dinner one evening trying to watch it,0.07077662
and I was like forget this,0.05366345
so I went back on a rainy afternoon,0.13277721
and I watched the whole thing all the way through and ice again again as I said I felt it was worth it,0.06996291
and I would describe the Irishman the same way for both the positive and the negative,0.14868219
so that's my review of the Irishman very curious tear your thoughts down below be sure to hit that subscribe button and of course as always you can check out some more videos,0.18350476
