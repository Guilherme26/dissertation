Daniel Craig who is the private investigator who is hired he has a wonderfully forced,0.022731321
and awkward southern accent that adds to the charm and I'm not saying it as,0.04499036
a bad thing because it really does just round out his character at one point,0.033495322
it's in one of the trail Chris Evans is like CSI KFC and that's kind,0.032259412
of what it is he's got this just this Southern drawl to him that is,0.05684859
just exaggerated but it really works it's like molasses rolling off your tongue the chemistry,0.13560633
of the cast is wonderful especially in their dysfunction as a family and I love,0.07920674
how the story unfolds at the beginning all of their stories their accounts are cut,0.01659234
together in a very entertaining way there are a lot of twists and turns of,0.048619602
this and despite finding out a lot that happens about halfway through the film they,0.017278811
still hold back enough to keep it very entertaining and to just keep giving you,0.068667576
misdirection so that you have to keep guessing the movie does have comedy and it,0.041226752
is funny but it's not overly so which allows it to stay away from the,0.032227483
goofiness I mean there are goofy moments in there but they're very small and and,0.20018104
far between so that's why I said like at the very beginning of this in,0.028026182
my intro that it's a little like clue but more along the lines towards Agatha,0.045942903
Christie I mean there's a lot more mystery to it with just a tiny bit,0.20935059
of you know goofiness thrown in the comedy though is still there especially from La,0.18504743
Keith Stanfield he does some amazing looks and emotions with his eyes and he doesn't,0.042534504
talk but he conveys so much in these moments and it was just awesome to,0.047138903
watch because you know exactly what he's thinking because we were thinking it also and,0.019537108
he is just confirming it for us Daniel Craig and honored Armas end up being,0.04054494
the leads in this which was surprising to me I didn't realize they would have,0.022622896
as much screen time as they did they work really great together especially when you,0.037954047
factor into our mice's character oddity it's brilliant and awesome and a great addition to,0.040288176
her character and something that I don't think I've ever seen before and so it,0.05105484
was really it was funny but it added a whole new level to her character,0.02511933

than heard even though he is the punchline to some really funny quips the story,0.017007416
balance the characters very well but like I said they don't all have equal screen,0.022322899
time which I guess is kind of a problem just when you have such a,0.042406123
large ensemble cast that some are gonna take the forefront some are gonna have to,0.019111391
fall back and you just you trust the story and if it works then it,0.034195762
works and in this it works because it doesn't feel like it's missing anything and,0.025496488
then one thing that I really loved is that I didn't guess the outcome that's,0.014494352
a huge thing for me especially in a mystery because if I can guess it,0.05282423
right off the bat or even partway through and then that's what it ends up,0.048116058
being I just kind of been bored and a little disappointed I mean yay me,0.054395393
but come on I just sat through a long movie and if I guessed it,0.054275658

Christie she was really good and very innovative in the way that she would tell,0.043849573
a mystery there are a few moments that dragged a little bit I mean the,0.051012933
movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes long but for the most part it seemed,0.025398042
to move at an efficient pace now one thing that has me curious like any,0.02899735
good mystery is will it hold up to multiple viewings I mean once you know,0.022675445
who did it can you watch it again and can you still be entertained I,0.030275168
