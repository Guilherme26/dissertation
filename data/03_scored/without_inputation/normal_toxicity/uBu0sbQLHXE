hey there's hope hi everyone my name is Chris and welcome to tread talks where I walk on this treadmill to stay in shape while making videos for you fine people,0.1506889
I stepped into Wonder Woman the same way that,0.11965348
many of you will hoping that the character that we get a glimpse of in Batman V Superman could be fleshed out into someone whose journey,0.101881325
we want to follow,0.040225815
and what they've done with this film is more than meet that expectation,0.07431217
the core premise of the movie is thankfully focused and simple we follow a sheltered Princess Diana as she's drawn into the conflict of the First World War and through that premise we see her journey and discovering who she is what she's capable of and ultimately what role she'll choose to play in the world and right up front,0.16734853
I'll say that gal gadot is spot on as Wonder Woman whatever concerns,0.11988753
we may have had from the limited performance we saw in Batman,0.05669155
V,
Superman is quickly replaced by what we see here there's emotional weight and range there's believable conviction,0.083093554
and a general optimistic sincerity that's difficult to pull off and yet she does so easily and that's on top of doing an admirable job of selling the physicality of the character,0.08701389
she takes things that could come off as cheesy or silly,0.69542736
and for the most part makes it convincing and beyond that I think I'll nominate Chris Pine as one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood today his relationship with Diana is one of the main reasons the movie works so well their chemistry with each other quickly wins us over,0.057069372
and as the movie progresses,0.077672504
we see him slip easily between humor and drama,0.19127953
and he ends up serving as the perfect counterpoint to her focused idealism and there's a moment in the movie where the camera lingers on his face,0.15242119
and you see the multitude of emotions that he's experiencing all in a short span of time,0.09622197
it's a wonderful moment amidst a great supporting performance now as far as the story is concerned,0.05576926
I really appreciated the level of focus,0.058785047
they kept throughout the film almost every character whether it's Diana's mother her trainer Steve Trevor or Diana herself all their motivations are made clear without hitting us over the head with it,0.09318862
and I also thought it was great how the fish-out-of-water elements were just played up for Laughs,0.11488442
and humor,0.056040715
instead we have a story where Diana's understanding of humanity is intertwined with her discovery of who she is and the decision about the role she'll play in the world,0.08338948
and so by the end you have some themes that come to a satisfying conclusion because we've been able to track with it throughout the entire story to go along with that I also found the tone and the mindset of the characters to be a refreshing departure from what seems to have been established in the DC extended universe,0.052710228
so far Diana herself has cast as a determined and optimistic,0.15253162
warrior someone that we want to root for and follow because she fights for something that is nobler than vengeance or bitterness,0.20818159
and the movie also allows for moments of celebration,0.057739783
and levity that are appropriate to the overall tone of the film,0.1334626
and thankfully the climax of the movie succeeds not so much on the shoulders of computer-generated imagery but because of the relationships and the drama that we've been following throughout it was believable and it manages to save the movie from what would have otherwise been an average superhero movie climax of course,0.0573804
there are a few missteps but nothing that Sully's,0.104705885
the overall experience of the movie the villains that you see throughout the film for example they're pretty one-dimensional and shallow,0.13982809
in fact there's a scene where they're practically cackling to one another over the fiendishness of what they've just done it's pretty difficult to take them seriously you'll also see some moments that go a little bit too far into cheesiness territory,0.2487248
but the performances are sincere enough that I didn't mind,0.05587295
and there are a couple of moments in the action where slow motion was used a little bit too liberally for my taste,0.14422263
but I did appreciate the clarity and the impact that it added to most of those scenes,0.054135006
and finally although the movie flows very well the final act of the film is set into motion by a character making an unnecessary revelation it's the kind of thing that I faulted guardians of the galaxy 2 for and it's almost as if they couldn't find a natural way to bring that about but in the end all of this pales in comparison to how much the movie does right,0.038064305
this is a movie that should give some hope to the overall success of the DC extended universe,0.07613137
it's a strong and touching origin story that leaves you with a big old smile on your face,0.38950336
and that's why I give Wonder Woman three and a half out of 5 stars,0.10956561
okay so that was Wonder Woman,0.16489103
now this was one of those rare instances where I was able to see a film before its release,0.054092016
so it's great to be able to share my opinion while it still may have some impact,0.042524174
so if you go see this movie let me know if you liked it as much,0.12054436
as I did beyond that over the course of the next week or so I'll be travelling,0.042631827
so the next videos will come a couple of weeks from,0.09612413
now one is going to be on the fitness side where I did a ninja warrior type challenge so you'll see how I stack up in my current shape and fitness and on the other hand I'll be reviewing cars 3 when it comes out in the middle of June,0.07994275
so please look forward to those,0.05834212
