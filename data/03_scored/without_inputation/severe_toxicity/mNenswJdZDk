you know maybe just maybe we've been a little too hard on M night Shyamalan,0.07728436
because apparently coming up with endings for thrillers is hard just ask Jordan Peele who,0.04140835
in my opinion is now 0 for 2 although I do like his nifty new,0.03768465
title a car door opening sequence for monkey paw productions it's so Wes Anderson 8,0.08196659
but back to M night and I suspect by the way we're gonna be seeing,0.025151258
a lot of monkey paw productions just like we've seen a lot of at night,0.16462363
and we used to love M night remember that the sixth sense with alt was,0.023577435
also nominated for a slew of Oscars and Peele just like M night has quickly,0.07685665
become a master of coming up with very cool intriguing ideas what are they differ,0.029286705
though to be honest as the peel leans in heavily to social commentary which makes,0.011282845
I think it not only makes you really root for the guy while we rooted,0.11697321
for M night at one point but you know PL seems to be doing I,0.02984413
think in some to some degree is doing so much good that you're not only,0.07131966
rooting for him but it makes a little harder to criticize but I do it,0.03297182
with love and I have a lot of good stuff to say here too so,0.020890092
I hope that it washes out and it's constructive criticism I believe I feel like,0.028821742
the ghosts of Hollywood future if these shadows remain unchanged this is the future I,0.021904498
see for you Jordan Peele learned how to write a third act alright so anyway,0.07361521
on the one hand when it comes to opportunities for black actors and representation for,0.04822382
black audiences peel is doing truly extraordinary work it really is cool to say it's,0.123755425
like yeah I'm so happy and it's good it's really good work which we'll discuss,0.0334308
however peel has admitted that us the movie is a Rorschach test like that teaser,0.030861195
posters you might recall and he intentionally has no clear answers or message for his,0.019803848
audience some of you might be like oh I love that but here's the thing,0.029961202
if you're if you're gonna have if you're gonna be really loose on the message,0.06371594
and maybe some of the answers then your narrative has to be stronger in terms,0.06593367
structurally right you got to have got to have something that's sturdy and I feel,0.038379766
the last half of this movie is just all over the place but anyway this,0.043077957
isn't a spoiler review so it's it's hard it's gonna be hard for you to,0.035284
believe this especially as you watch the first half of the movie which is so,0.03308956
freakin amazing you'll be like how could this go wrong and then you'll be like,0.4041196
oh yeah I see what you're talking about now it's kind of shocking how little,0.042587716
answers you get you're like you're not gonna really explain any of it alright so,0.08471579
Pele has put out there that he has given some thought while making this movie,0.046125166
to the duality of the black experience his words are not mine in America I,0.32928348
think that that's I don't really see that reflected anywhere in the movie I think,0.034251638
he's just kind of pushing the mentality of people who are seeing it in that,0.07478793
direction being like you're like what is this about Jordan he's like you know what,0.034872252
it might be about and I'm like make a commitment I think non-committal I think,0.05619072
it's a very good way to describe this movie in terms of what it's what,0.051735323
it's about right because as I said that's barely represented in the script beyond the,0.022306269
central conceit that's what I get for trying to use a big vocabulary word the,0.031148555
central idea of people discovering that they have duplicates right in fact if this was,0.044651117
truly a movie about duality including the black experience in America and even beyond that,0.06360686
because I think duality is a concept that everyone can relate to and everyone would,0.008997274
want to confront right then that would permeate every aspect of the characters and the,0.014853551
story that's how you make a movie about duality and this is not that a,0.012906558
bottom line as I said Pele puts together a first half of a movie that's,0.061386473
pretty much perfect and then the thing just starts to unravel significantly and quite quickly,0.01939742
until it just stops with a non ending like movies over and you're like really,0.089135274
hmm I think whether or not you love us and some people love it to,0.03875759
be fair depends on two things one you don't see the other end twists coming,0.014172403
I figured it out about 15 minutes into the movie so the big reveal couldn't,0.02843261
distract me from the third act problems and I suspect it well for many others,0.067943186
and two if you can successfully project your own social commentary of choice under the,0.012291264
moon then you're gonna obviously be like I love this movie it represents everything that,0.06773233
I wanted to represent because Jordan Peele just made a really loose construct for you,0.062970944
to do with what you will but again as I said to me I think,0.03699419
the film is just so non-committal I don't really feel you can reward a film,0.03945803
for being so likes so non-committal like it's not a it's like I almost feel,0.116655916
like it's refusing to take a stand rather than being a tool for you to,0.05276902
use it's like you can do that I don't think so I don't see how,0.035018593
it can have a message if there's really just nothing there to build on I,0.024665674
mean it's it requires so much projection the message is entirely personally generated and I,0.01921383
guess you know that is a valid form of art one could say like abstract,0.02218188
art but uh it's it's not very rewarding in my opinion as if it's a,0.037504386
piece of entertainment we'll talk about the entertainment value of the movie in just a,0.027549911
moment but one other thing I want to add is that I thought the film,0.023886079
for the first half of it was really progressive in that Lupita Nyong'o gets to,0.040717885
play a Toni Collette hereditary type role and Winston Duke gets to play and both,0.061496895
of them do it quite well Winston Duke is like a Clark Griswold type dad,0.10052322
I thought that was so wonderful so if us though it turns out is going,0.055443723
to be more about you know race politics right and Nyong'o and Duke in these,0.11930268
roles is more a commentary than them legitimately just getting these roles and acing them,0.05293864
well I mean it's like are they actually I guess what I'm trying to say,0.044015866
it's like are they actually just playing these characters is it that kind of cool,0.025276313
opportunity for them or they like what you know black actors ironically playing these roles,0.24668379
I don't like that I don't like the latter I think the former to me,0.046398554
is really exciting and the latter is like I think arguably less progressive but okay,0.04146023
so all this aside how was the movie as a piece of entertainment well I,0.07023341
think it's wildly entertaining for the first half as I said perfect and well peel,0.08559184
his writing needs some work some he might be like god damn it grace peel,0.4860616
us an Oscar he's very good at coming up with an idea as I said,0.0577845
at the beginning of this review and also don't forget the Oscars are very political,0.016436022
and they sometimes you know democratically dole out awards to different films and really the,0.026921978
best the best Oscar forget out to receive was for writing and it allowed the,0.015949108
Academy to give Jordan peel something for his work even though he just could not,0.017696546
win in other categories because again the politics of it all but I think his,0.035180897
writing needs some work but damn has he quickly evolved into a master director the,0.40846127
opening sequence of us has to be seen the opening scene is so good that,0.021986315
it races the entire film up to such a high degree that it carries the,0.07875774
entire rest of it even the third act you're like yeah this is not great,0.1069296
but I just I still have that opening in my mind it was so good,0.026032627
I'll tell you how good it was when I went to film school I had,0.025904913
this professor who taught us filmmaking by just having us watch sequences from Spielberg's jaws,0.032299988
again and again this sequence is that good so one I can't wait to see,0.028674072
it again I don't know I didn't even as you can see I have major,0.037341416
problems with the film and I'm excited to see it again I don't have my,0.03617202
tickets then all the way through the Wilsons leaving their neighbors home about halfway through,0.037991963
again the movie is shockingly good like in terms of the shining when it comes,0.01990429
to being well constructed I love by the way that Jordan Peele has been walking,0.0726181
around doing interviews dressed as Jack Torrance from the shining and intentionally it's so smart,0.060872287
he loves Easter eggs this movie has tons of Easter eggs in it and that,0.06304943
and then in that regard it's a little bit like scream and then it's very,0.08198389
clever and meta both in terms of pop culture but I also really liked that,0.01811295
it had a lot of nods to african-american history and culture which I thought was,0.06886912
a really nice touch again it's not really a message but it's again really cool,0.0333849
Easter eggs and I think gives the film I think not only a level of,0.105279945
authenticity but I felt like legitimacy again they are not ironically playing these roles it's,0.04081833
really about this really nice family and this is the types of things they would,0.025393385
have in their home like for instance like from a Howard sweatshirt to Alvin Ailey,0.015806094
Dance posters I thought that was great the movie is also terrifying so scary I'm,0.0302459
a bit of a wimp when it comes to scary movies as you know but,0.2534704
I hit my eyes a lot and the idea of being attacked by yourself is,0.3382534
truly disturbing like you kind of get an idea in the trailers but trust me,0.0921439
you have no real idea of how disturbing it is until you see this movie,0.079641774
and it's heightened by the entire casts fantastic ability to hypnotically play to very different,0.032209523
sides of the same coin I was like wow you really are like very different,0.05661777
I love it and while everyone in the cast does a great job this is,0.059199348
truly Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Dukes film their performances are truly captivating funny and charming,0.058585383
and they both come across like true movie stars I love it I also love,0.038817458
the Wilson family as a whole and their likability relatability and spunk you'll know what,0.08052913
I'm talking about when you see the movie I think helps to soften the blow,0.06711703
as the film or disappointment let's say as the film begins to unravel you're like,0.012490818
ah but at least I'm still with the Wilson so what a cool family and,0.014483044
we'll talk about all that the unraveling and the spoiler review but as I tweeted,0.01579279
earlier today despite being deeply flawed I feel that the first half of us is,0.01981316
so good that it truly is a must st. so that's my review of us,0.058702458
