hey guys Sam back here again and this week on our in this edition of,0.06354757
the criterion collection review we're going to be looking at a film that sort of,0.06642286
kick-started Alfred Hitchcock's period in America and it's also a part of a trilogy I've,0.1932769
sort of coined specifically for this review series which is three films I'm reviewing in,0.09157431
a row both starting with the letter R last one was for Fifi of the,0.04532988
one we'll be doing next time is Rashomon but right now we're going to be,0.05624313
talking about the haunting Gothic romance Rebecca which is actually going to be number 135,0.100785576
in the collection but this is the most recent transfer by criterion released a year,0.05068401
or two ago I believe now Rebecca I actually saw back in high school because,0.06335255
one of my teachers who was also a big film nerd actually lent me a,0.5465456
copy or her copy of it and I immediately fell in love with the movie,0.10255615
and when I saw criterium was releasing it I believe that was around the time,0.05496622
they had a sale I had to pick it up it's it's just such a,0.0821928
fantastic movie and rewatching it and I think this was the first time I've watched,0.103269964
the movie for about two or three years and there were a lot of things,0.062460877
about it I had forgotten and I sort of rediscovered my love for the film,0.09409231
so I'm very excited to talk about it quite honestly but to get into the,0.079186924
plot Rebecca follows on this love story or this this is the relationship between a,0.05343091
young woman played by Joan Fontaine who actually has no name within the film she,0.11526597
isn't she isn't called by name and this often referred to as mrs. Dewinter as,0.10566097
she does eventually become the wife of the widower maximilian de Wynter played by Laurence,0.14764413
Olivier who they meet while they're both in Morocco I want to say and it,0.09369631
had this whirlwind romance getting married a few weeks later and she's whisked away to,0.19513957
Max's Max's large estate which is referred to as Mandalay which is this sort of,0.02915629
this like almost impossible Gothic mansion this large structure that has a lot of importance,0.1536194
within the town that max lives in and everyone sort of evolved in the goings,0.12982054
on within that within that that mansion one of the most important and most iconic,0.04828455
events that happened there was actually the death of max's previous wife rebecca who one,0.09327888
night went out into the sea and her boat sunk and she drowned with it,0.49237075
and so everyone has been sort of excitedly waiting for max to find new love,0.08073402
and stop being in this depressive slump since the death of rebecca but Joan Fontaine,0.2792654
or mrs. Dewinter moves into Mandalay and soon feels unnerved and unease while living there,0.10547432
not only because of the the servants are the sort of the house maid that,0.13162063
lives there whose name is escaping me who constantly seems to be doubting and questioning,0.13260996
her motives and her actions but even more directly by the memory and almost the,0.11605291
the ghost of Rebecca where Rebecca's initials are on so many different like pillows and,0.08512542
clothes and her side of the house has been closed off and you know this,0.15540645
woman is constantly comparing herself to Rebecca and trying to be like her but there,0.31089434
is definitely a deeper darker secret going on beneath the surface and so it's sort,0.10476778
of a psychological thriller set within the Gothic genre and I think specifically talking about,0.1929614
genre that might be the best place to start Alfred Hitchcock I don't think is,0.08726316
really known for gothic horror he's known for thrillers and more like direct horror like,0.3426896
with things like the birds or with with psycho but I think I kind of,0.2440717
wish Alfred Hitchcock had more of an interest in the genre because as an adaptation,0.078284904
of a gothic novel as a visualization of it Rebecca is a gorgeous looking film,0.09970903
the mansion itself Mandalay is just a bunch of separate sets and rooms put together,0.14864837
but it just feels so grand and massive and kind of daunting you know I,0.058275674
mean the movie begins with with the main character mrs. Dewinter recounting a narration like,0.064275146
I always go back to to Mandalay my dreams we can never return but I,0.17121153
always come back to it you know it has this sort of seductive power that,0.07501363
makes it this irresistible location that is full of mystery and like decadence and the,0.09026431
way that they film the rooms and people within the rooms and the use of,0.1096782
shadows and just it's it's some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a,0.06458262
Hitchcock movie it's there's some very striking imagery and in this movie that really sticks,0.14608404
with me and I think just as an adaptation of a gothic story it does,0.07545429
a fantastic job within the genre tropes and sort of avoid I've had a lot,0.10269761
of gothic novels I took a class at college talking about gothic novels and a,0.046163075
lot of them hint at supernatural elements and then turns out there are supernatural elements,0.08583136
and I I don't know if this is necessarily a spoiler but there is no,0.06434316
supernatural element to Rebecca but there is this this presence right where you are unsure,0.09547372
if there is a ghost if there is a spirit you know like maybe Rebecca,0.053682353
really is haunting this place maybe not as a physical spirit but definitely her memory,0.112147935
and the expectations that come with that are definitely haunting this woman and I think,0.2698193
that's probably one of my favorite aspects of the plot is this is Joan Fontaine's,0.04858675
character dealing with this expectation where she is sort of thrust into this new role,0.09905685
as like the head of a household where she's supposed to take care of the,0.18316197
same duties and pick up almost exactly where Rebecca left off but she's never you,0.11465385
know she's a working-class girl she's never had to deal with high society and sort,0.39314672
of the anxiety and pressure that comes from living up to those expectations it's it's,0.06396751
really engaging at least to me and a big part of that is Joan Fontaine's,0.064561516
performance she is simply incredible in this film she has this ability to appear and,0.11798901
act very like weak and docile and there's a special feature on here that we'll,0.1548107
get to later we're one of the interviewers or commentators discusses how she looks like,0.08258291
a newborn fawn you know where she feels very like angelic and and and and,0.15038022
as if something something that needs to be protected but there does come a point,0.050503295
in the film where she gains more power are they self-confidence and she can play,0.08647362
both very well and she just absolutely kills it Laurence Olivier is good and he's,0.73894393
Laurence Olivier classically trained actor big star at the time and he has a good,0.095338434
job of course but one of the issues with Rebecca and I'm not sure well,0.07498488
I say it's an issue but this might be intentional I don't know but it,0.10421926
feels intentional sometimes is that the romance between Max Max and Joan Fontaine's character doesn't,0.022841543
really feel genuine and I think part of that is how quickly their romance happens,0.070947774
just how fast they fall in love and get married and then whenever they're together,0.09079861
they're sort of bickering and fighting and they think that's kind of the point um,0.24024916
it doesn't necessarily make for a convincing bromance that I feel like the movie is,0.06886576
trying to get across at the very end but it does make for a compelling,0.09131216
conflict right where you have this woman who is not only anxious about living up,0.40314257
to the widow's you know the previous wife's lifestyle vacations that she said but I,0.059484486
was also just trying to live up to this husband that she barely knows and,0.2293717
slowly learning what type of person he is and he's a very controlling manipulative kind,0.39523458
of person that is very off-putting but does a great job for developing these characters,0.14883797
and this conflict and narrative and so to jump off of that relationship I feel,0.19062781
like Rebecca is just to me is an extremely engaging movie not just visually but,0.09554369
character wise I'm really struck by sort of this these these power plays within their,0.1046105
relationship not only between Max and and an enjoyment Eanes character but also between Joan,0.05250384
Fontaine and Rebecca and how Rebecca despite you know being dead Syl still seems to,0.32570148
have power and domain over this house and over the new wife it's it's simply,0.08523784
incredible and Alfred Hitchcock does or at least the film crew does such an incredible,0.06008275
job making Rebecca's presence felt and there are some amazing sequences in the film where,0.03183679
the camera is sort of like pans around a room and moves around in a,0.1446665
way as if it's as if there is a person in the center of the,0.055583417
frame performing actions that are being described and it does such an incredible job at,0.03919633
like conveying how how ideas and people and memories haunt us I just think I,0.089885905
just think Rebecca is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best and I think it's such an,0.06335394
incredible exploration of like anxiety and like not guilt but like expectation and the and,0.047880184
the toxicity of relationships and how past events can can affect the present and you,0.12884906
know all these different themes and ideas leading to of finality like a final 30,0.078051984
minutes that I originally thought there was a criticism in the finale where we sort,0.099426396
of leave Mandalay for four different plots that going to the town and I thought,0.07053548
like man I really wish we were back at Mandalay wish we were back in,0.12877533
the in the house and I realized that's kind of the point right like that,0.06386517
is what is so like it the movie has achieved conveying to me how important,0.09753369
and like seductive this house is this this this place is how its mystery draws,0.051602427
us in just like the mystery of the plot and I think it's just it's,0.0849585
it's one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies if not my favorite it's the one,0.13123427
he actually won the only movie he won an Oscar for anyone Best Picture for,0.05505735
it which he wasn't even present to accept which that actually kind of segues nicely,0.15882336
into the special features so these special features in Rebecca sort of our mixture are,0.05140324
are one of two things you either have a special feature talking about the film,0.09391492
and the weights and like the way it looks and analyzing the themes and the,0.055080924
ideas or it's a special feature talking about the relationship between alfred hitchcock and producer,0.27164975
David L Selznick who at the time was probably the biggest producer in Hollywood just,0.055627167
coming off with a success of Gone with the Wind and would go on to,0.07231017
make many other successes in that era of 30s 40s era of Hollywood and for,0.053307783
me the most interesting special feature here is the the discussion of a conversation between,0.053153425
between these two authors Molly Haskell and Patricia white where they speak about Rebecca specifically,0.0745385
in feminist terms and how its representation for her women and dynamics between women and,0.15721762
their relationships and that to me was very enlightening and very fascinating especially being a,0.05910775
guy I think it's important to listen to how women feel about a movie about,0.31089434
women especially with a female main character at a time when women's roles are very,0.3009601
minor are very you know weren't handled well but there's great behind-the-scenes about the production,0.076442994
and specifically the feuds between Alfred Hitchcock and David L Selznick and even the commentary,0.118423775
track is really interesting going into the behind the scenes as well as just commentating,0.14978155
on themes and ideas within the film and then the booklet the booklet written by,0.03888257
if I can find his name written by David Thompson or David Thompson details not,0.05739807
only the themes of the film and the production but it also details the history,0.023820948
of the script and the adaptation and again Alfred Hitchcock and David L Selznick's tensions,0.06605177
onset along with this is probably one of the coolest things I've seen so far,0.062728934
now I'll say that so far is the booklet includes memo notes sent between Alfred,0.042558037
Hitchcock and David Selznick which is super cool that's it that's a really incredible piece,0.076790795
of film history and again showing why criterion is the best at creating these special,0.05461538
features especially for classic and spectacular movies like this so I mean even if you,0.106818385
don't like Rebecca if you watch it it's not your thing I would still recommend,0.25783297
buying this Edition for that piece of film history for the conversations and the special,0.07015024
features all of it makes the purchase worth it in my opinion but yeah highly,0.08865477
recommend Rebecca please go out and watch it also please come back next time we'll,0.14260983
be talking about the third film in our our trilogy which is a character I,0.06462784
was Rashomon probably his most famous and Robbie's most famous film and the film that,0.0149381
introduced the West to foreign films and Japanese films in general but for now if,0.007842499
