well guys it's spooky season,0.15425865
and you know what that means horror reviews in particular i wanted to talk about four silent horror films this year that i thought would be really fascinating to talk about,0.13235849
so anyway let's waste no more time and talk about the cabinet of dr,0.19140877
caligari the cabinet of dr,0.09029333
caligari was directed by robert vine and tells the story of francis who in turn tells us the story of how he got involved with a strange hypnotist named dr,0.122088164
caligari who uses a sleepwalking man to commit heinous crimes this film was released in 1920,0.31048408
so this year it is celebrating its 100 year anniversary,0.05189018
so i absolutely had to talk about this film,0.1229804
but also this film has a very important place in horror history as it is often seen as the first in a long line of feature-length horror films,0.09599735
and i think that is really fascinating,0.054170858
and it's really interesting going back to this film and seeing how much it has influenced the genre many years later this film was part of the german expressionist movement that was going on at the time in germany and i'm not going to spend too much time on that because it has a really fascinating history,0.08432377
i'm not going to go into the history or pretty much any of the themes or thematic material that a lot of people go into because you can perfectly find that anywhere on the internet,0.107730314
i just wanted to talk about this movie and how much i really enjoyed this,0.10165988
this is actually my third time watching this film but this is the moment that i really was like man,0.11886063
i actually really like this film a lot,0.07836762
i love,0.056826867
its visual splendor which is basically the reason to watch the movie the visuals are fantastic in this film the angles nothing in this film is at a right angle,0.103712514
everything is at strange weird angles,0.10825557
the lighting is so strange because it's so unnatural because if you look at the shadows throughout the film you might notice that they're actually painted onto the sets that really makes these visual shots just so interesting and planned out and they're really beautiful to look at this is a really good looking film,0.09883063
and if you're looking for something with a lot of style,0.09291181
i don't think you have to look much farther than the cabinet of dr,0.15140879
caligari,0.03910246
it's got just so much splendor and artistry in it and it's very powerful to look at many directors have been influenced by this you see this in the later horror films like dracula or frankenstein,0.09367478
but also you see it in later filmmakers such as tim burton who also does the weird thing of not having everything at a right angle,0.12022372
and even the character of cesar who is the sleepwalker character that dr,0.1170369
caligari has going around murdering people is very similar in look to edward scissorhands,0.5876557
and i think that's not a coincidence at all it was very much a influential film for tim burton as it has been for a lot of people,0.123074435
and also i was surprised by how creepy i absolutely found this film the character of dr,0.19398478
caligari,0.03910246
in fact the actor that plays him is extremely sinister in this film there's just something about he has these very circular glasses that have this dark black rim around them that make his eyes just pop out and it's really creepy,0.4451457
there is a continuous feeling of dread throughout this entire movie that really never lets up and the visuals on top of that really make you feel like you're in a dream world it just doesn't feel real which actually does go into parts of the plot of the movie that go on later on which i'll say for my spoilers section but yes the visuals are fantastic,0.08805292
and i actually really enjoy this story and how it is framed as this man is you know telling this other man the story of dr,0.10056922
caligari,0.03910242
and i think that's really cool also the score that was used for this film,0.081210695
i'm not particularly sure if it was a score that was written for the film or if this was a score that was added much later with a restoration but it really sets the tone of this movie very,0.06464036
well i really enjoyed it a lot it's a lot of fun,0.09394447
now of course a lot of the things that this movie does seems a lot primitive,0.11178934
now with the way they you know draw basically odd the sets to make the shadows work,0.06546205
or you know the flimsy looking sets but that adds to the charm and really this disorienting feeling that you feel throughout the entire film which leads into our spoiler section,0.103907764
so if you don't want to know anything about this 100 year old film step away and return to this time code,0.084071465
so that you don't get spoiled but basically this movie is more or less a fever dream of our main character who is actually insane at the end of the movie we figured this out that he's been at an insane,0.3950776
asylum this whole time,0.1549669
and that dr,0.057821244
caligari is actually the director of this asylum and might not be a terrible person at all we see that many of the people that our main character encounters throughout the film are actually patience at this mental institution which i think is it's a really really good twist,0.3174155
but also it brings up the question of what was real and what was not,0.04280239
and i think it is really apparent just due to the visual nature of the film and how everything looks kind of off kilter and awkward and wrong,0.15474345
it is probably true that our main character is completely crazy and has lost his mind and we're basically seeing a movie through the eyes of a madman and i think that is extremely cool,0.44664982
it's a great twist for this film however i will say that i think that the twist can be a little confusing,0.052924134
now this might not be confusing for everybody but i will say i did watch this with my mom and she was a little confused as to the ending of the film i think you know maybe things could have been cleared up a little bit more,0.10780471
it could have also been the translation of the film that we were watching,0.032489784
but nonetheless i think the twist of this film is fantastic,0.116388075
i think it's really intriguing and makes you think of the film in a completely different way i also really like the way the title cards are written in this film with this really unique interesting style of you know showing us the text of the film i think it's really interesting,0.041460156
i've never seen another silent film really have text on the screen quite like this that's so disorienting to watch and that is really this film completely summed up,0.091545984
it is disorienting,0.13848883
it is dreamlike,0.073650435
and it is absolutely a wonder to watch it is a beautiful looking film,0.07547474
and definitely just the influence of this film is shown throughout all of horror but anyway with all that said i'm gonna give the cabinet of dr,0.14648224
