good guys welcome back to the first take ah I don't even know where to start with this to say I saw Logan and mother [ __ ] Oh [Music] I'm debating to say it may be the best since the dark night I debate as to whether to do this reaction in the cinema i figure i need to just hold off I need to lay bad yet it's kind of like walking in as an adult walking in to your parents bedroom and seeing them getting down with third person and despatched shock at rumor that issue you have to kind of just step out will you actually verbalizing communicates that is the feel of the washing loegering loegering the furs and suppose it last of the hugh jackman led wolverine films if you're familiar with the old man local school allow for the comic book it's nothing like that you're gonna have surprise these things are going to happy that you did not see coming we've got Logan this pretty almost perfect character at this point and it really shocking it's very small intimate movies not like a big boombastic end of the world like x-men apocalypse try to be it just keeps it really about characters it really is more of a character study said deterioration of one man and his fence on purpose and the way that he relates to the world Logan is broken he's always worked up Professor Xavier even worse food Patrick Stewart Patrick [ __ ] Stewart who will be going yeah are you going to be surprised I know this is Patrick Stewart as you've never seen like this all kinds of [ __ ] up in a good way Caliban doesn't get a whole lot shot but that's the thing mobile Studios proper they have this issue where they have bad guys are just hollow shells you know it's enjoyable day movies are if villains are just empty nothingness in this the bad guys what that empty love it looks like Batman vs Superman Encino yeah activity the villains of the modern move yeah they don't really cut flesh them out world in this we get villains that don't have a whole lot of screen time and we don't really get that deep into how they got to where they are but their personalities very much fleshed out do divorce being from a narco the blond dude usually the trailer with the robot I can really good really sinister benefits there's a whole wall maybe so I'm an egg do their personality so well developed and they become a legitimate threat for Hugh Jackman they're basically not initially after him when let certain other character x-23 comes into the picture worlds collide basically so huge n minus the character really doesn't want to get involved is any it is because he that probably doesn't give a [ __ ] you know he doesn't care about the world and we get the people in it but he's made to care about this one character and it's legitimately emotional like you will get cleared this industry not going to spoil I'm not going to give it away there's definitely lots of crying doing gonna see coming one if you sit up but just in the way that these characters are legitimate people now tonight obviously we've seen Jack before with leukemia claim over in so obviously we can add that connection but again watching basic reach across he was the main character in that but was there any emotional impact when has there ever been an emotional impact award when really it's fun to watch it's fun to see people [ __ ] up or want to see him put people up which he has never done like he's done in this now lot was made of the r rating in the state don't eat red laces are 15 over here yeah but but that's bloody lawyer way whiskey and faces slashed off with me and brain mass flat I was being cruel going to face leave and come out mouth and back into advocates fakhri but this is what Warren should be the first time ever we get to see on screen the true Wolverine Grey's kind of like tell you from the x-men card and back in the door The Scream claws at the sky and [ __ ] up people and you just sitting there thinking year yeah it makes your we lock up second street movie Shekhar yeah I yeah they're all right not an X 23 holy [ __ ] cuz that let me go yeah if you think hit go with a kickoff character Wow x-23 wicked up pray we get to see more of her the director of this marigold says that he knows open to the possibility of doing x-23 movie that would be interesting to see how they can develop her character even more she barely says anything in this barely but again it's such a well made movie no movies are the word this is such a well made film that even casually don't say anything because they don't take that mentality of it being I just a superhero movie we don't really need to give people logical motivations to Lana do things they don't take that approach to actually think about what is everything is logical everything makes sense and then you can just believe and I love it a [ __ ] love it like seriously sir odyssey again conway key again is truly is going to be huge Evans lost Wolverine film or lost time being Wolverine this is the perfect way to bow out what he deserves as well nearly 20 years be bloody films have been getting missed most of the time no he stayed low we start with it this is movie deserves if it's going to be some songs that I like it it back soon after credits for anything like a bat this is the [ __ ] is now I'm hearing online that there is a post credit scene no he was prescribed Willie somewhat going to say but I won't know because in the preview screen like what to go to there was nothing Oh watch it wants to set their way in yes I even went online just a double check is like yes there is stick around nothing all the way together the credit people in the cinema those people that work there with stem / / they could have sex right they couldn't say hey guys may nothing to support the black light go on nothing but online they say that there is yeah so we will do the Flip what the [ __ ] yeah what's done what you guys are gonna have to tell me I've seen fake descriptions of it and then yeah I'm you guys can tell me the descriptions when you get to see your salesman it kind of makes me mad that the x-men universe is the cluster [ __ ] that is in terms of it being so fractured the x-men films proper at their own kind of continuity and the Wolverine films even though kind of the same character kind of had their own continuity like the Caliban character that's people know she plays in this Taliban was in the x-men snow but completely different character in a different clan is the less and the TV shows are their own thing you know getting the Legion that is all being completely but why can't they be consistent with this man it's a shame if you love the old man local comic book it's nothing like it but it's very much like it in same time you're gonna love it love film this could be legit me the first superhero film oh I don't know i'm going to say could we like seriously moon place to throw away the oscars have just happened so by the time necklace was coming around in a sort of forget about
