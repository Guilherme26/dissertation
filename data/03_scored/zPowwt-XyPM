be a criterium blu-ray I'm not sure when I see The Criterion films come out,0.1051914
on another from another company on blu-ray it makes me wonder if it's ever gonna,0.09371363
come out on their version of blu-ray so this movie was the only film that,0.12715508
of Hitchcock's that was ever nominated or there was ever won Best Picture I've won,0.060122866
the net for 1940 it was nominated for 11 Academy Awards but only one to,0.07369544
one for black-and-white cinematography and one for outstanding production which is basically Best Picture and,0.010627239
Hitchcock was nominated for a for Best Director but he didn't win he's he was,0.048810508
nominated several times but he actually never won for Best Director he was given an,0.04882059
honorary award later on in life it's said that he wasn't able to win because,0.14471218
he's definitely one of the best of all time and another thing about Rebecca is,0.039029367
this was his first American film before this everything he did was a British film,0.034723397
so this was kind of a landmark film in a lot of different ways but,0.06706997
it starts Joan Fontaine as the young woman or the young lady they don't actually,0.18686622
ever say her name in the movie it also stars Laurence Olivier and he plays,0.06471595
max to winter hopefully or Maxim de winter I can't remember it's been a few,0.073916435
months since I watched it but I've watched this like so many times and what,0.045439012
happens is you know the stories the movies called Rebecca the Rebecca is the name,0.056588095
of his wife who had passed away and he's and I think Monte Carlo and,0.22067897
he meets this young woman who was working as a hired companion for this rich,0.1519787
annoying woman and they fall in love and end up getting married like two weeks,0.5876557
after they meet and she moves back to Mandalay which is the house that he's,0.07811415
lived in his whole life it's this huge estate and the the house itself is,0.10276138
like another character in the film it's really hard to describe but it's it's amazing,0.050411314
and there is a woman who was kind of running things in the house and,0.24253951
she was like Rebecca's personal maid back when she was alive and her name is,0.09515338
mrs danvers' and she's kind of this sinister figure who really doesn't accept the new,0.37762636
wife and was completely obsessed with Rebecca like she was almost to the point where,0.106260106
she was in love with her and she tries to kind of ruin things for,0.45119432
the new verge on Fontaine's character throughout the movie she's constantly setting her up for,0.09271459
failure and making her feel horrible even at one point almost pushing her to the,0.33395767
edge of suicide but the film is just amazing and there's a huge mystery to,0.30473703
it at the end but I don't want to even tell you about that part,0.082813844
because it's kind of a really crazy twist in the story and it's great and,0.24746121
I want you guys to experience it for the first time without any first-hand knowledge,0.24037246
I think I may have given away a bit too much information in my last,0.13126977
reveal cabinet of dr. Caligari I didn't realize one of the things I said maybe,0.05075566
some of you who haven't seen the film it might have gone over your head,0.16298132
and hopefully it did so that you didn't catch on but I kind of gave,0.13236904
away one of the twists so I'm sorry about that if I ruined that for,0.13785668
you but anyways Rebecca amazing and like I said Joan Fontaine one of my favorite,0.11766119
actresses of all time she was nominated for Best Actress but didn't win in this,0.039712947
one and the following year 1941 she starred in suspicion which is actually one of,0.04627903
the first Hitchcock movies I ever saw and I love that one as well and,0.10569191
she did win Best Actress for that yeah so Hitchcock has done some amazing films,0.16828203
and it was hard it's hard to choose one of these to review because there's,0.09885254
a lot of different like amazing great movies there's at least three of them of,0.07318808
