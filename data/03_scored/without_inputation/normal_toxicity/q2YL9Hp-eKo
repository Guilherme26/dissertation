hey everyone welcome to scene by dawn today I'm gonna be reviewing the movie the shape of water with Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer,0.0928464
I have the pleasure of watching this movie at the Dubai International Film Festival as one of the 13 films that I watched there,0.042248458
so I'm slowly going through the lists as they're being released in the UAE this one in particular has taken some time being released in the UAE because of censorship issues,0.073469974
I'm not quite sure if this is one that you actually want to go to the cinema here to watch I am interested to go and see it here to see how it has been edited because I heard because there is nudity that there's been some sort of cover-up made for Sally Hawkins character,0.1710317
and I'm sure that certain activities that she was involved in will also have been concocted,0.08690043
sure ah the story is that ELISA Esposito is a mute janitor she can't speak,0.30397
because of this accident that she had when she was a child and she works at a research facility the scientists at this research facility have discovered this reptilian frog like sort of creature,0.4301751
and they're holding him in one of the labs and they want to use him as a part of space exploration and send him up into space,0.08259397
and it's somehow some sort of race between them and the Russians in the process of cleaning the facilities she starts to interact with this creature,0.35388103
and they develop a really cute relationship especially around hard-boiled eggs,0.30077988
and this lady really has a thing with hard-boiled eggs and really maximizes her time that is used during the making of hard-boiled eggs,0.31089434
I thought that Sally Hawkins did a really great job in this film however for myself I did find it really difficult seeing her naked and seeing her go through part of her borning routine especially during the cooking of her hard-boiled eggs,0.5256722
if you know what I'm saying if you've seen the film you know what she's doing anyway,0.11641702
so I couldn't find it difficult because Sally Hawkins plays mrs. Brown in the Paddington movies and I kept wanting to like yell at the screen dang like how long does it take to hard boil an egg I think it's only like 15 minutes but wow she uses that time personally let's just say she's like feeding him these eggs and they have this relationship,0.28088182
because he doesn't speak either,0.08500949
he's this reptile creature and and she can't speak if their relationship develops in this non verbal way but it was really cute and simple and deep and very sweet,0.40331075
and there's just this acceptance,0.05521272
he's not accepted for who he is and he's definitely being mistreated,0.13170666
she also is not accepted by a lot of people or society at large and fields rather marginalized because she can't speak,0.29549378
so they have this deep relationship,0.08659042
I really really liked the beginning half of this film I just thought it was beautifully made,0.0694952
I loved the development of their relationship,0.15011016
I loved the development of all of her other relationships,0.18933114
and just the development of ELISA Esposito's character itself however the last half of this film completely lost me like once she got him out of the facility,0.14867398
and then they started developing this more intimate relationship between the two of them,0.15105107
I don't know it just got weird,0.15337777
and I felt like the deeper themes that could have actually been really drawn out a lot more clearly and with a lot more care,0.067569174
I felt were a bit rushed like the ending and understanding how her injury plays into the carrying on of their relationship,0.17439578
I just felt like it didn't end in a way that really brought a lot of substance to that theme,0.090876475
it was there but I felt it was a bit rushed and it was a bit I just felt like it got a bit weird,0.31089434
and I felt like the story got lost in that I just didn't have the same feeling in the last half of the film that I had in the first half of the film that can understand why this film got the best picture at the Oscars because it's very artistic,0.0522682
and if you look at it that way it is a very beautiful film,0.05742101
but I just feel like the last part just really as a as a cinema goer and a fan of film and a lover of stories and I just felt like the last half of the film just kind of lost,0.069687225
it for me again this film B+ because I did like the artistry,0.091627836
I loved the music I loved the color palette,0.062704876
I really did like the development of her character,0.14827652
but then it sort of fell flat at the end so it lost marks there it is entertaining,0.07548924
but entertaining in an artistic sort of way give this video a big thumbs up if you like hard-boiled eggs don't forget to subscribe and ring that little bells,0.16085859
you don't miss out on anything that I've seen seen by Dawn,0.11408529
