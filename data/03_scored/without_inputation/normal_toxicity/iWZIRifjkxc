her homeland and a man is very rare around those parts and she then learns,0.31089434
of World War 1 and wants to help and take part and battle against the,0.105591364
German and I went to this screening really excited but at the same time realistic,0.18900467
I want to be a little reserved and I don't like to get my hopes,0.16331501
up because disappointment always sucks especially with big movies I'm excited for and the DC,0.74457383
movie since Man of Steel haven't impressed me that much I haven't yet seen a,0.06657744
great one one that I want to watch over and over and over that's a,0.08111202
breath I've been holding since 2013 Wonder Woman is the first really really legitimately good,0.114986345
DC EU movie despite all of the hate that went her way when she got,0.27292258
cast gal gadot owns the role of Wonder Woman she reminded me of Christopher Reeve,0.09665604
in the first Superman movie full of joy hope and completely without cynicism this is,0.2716501
a fantastic casting choice she really nailed this role this movie was a total blast,0.15206476
from start to finish it has a lot of the things that I want to,0.079248205
see in a superhero movie it's extremely funny Chris Pine has amazing chemistry with gal,0.082433246
gadot and there's two fish-out-of-water stories in this movie the first act is Chris Pine,0.099274255
in this place and he's like I don't get any of this and everything is,0.11210725
surprising to him and he's learning a lot about Diana and her upbringing and then,0.24414203
we have another fish out of the water story and that's Diana going away from,0.057457354
her homeland and learning about the real world and what's going on there and world,0.072447054
war one and so we get to see two characters who sort of teach each,0.18084829
other things which I was really happy about because I didn't want to just go,0.0658688
to this movie and see a perfect character with no flaws from the very beginning,0.07965762
she has a lot to learn she's very naive and the film was wise to,0.34709725
understand that and it allows you to go on this journey with her and feel,0.10218031
like you're experiencing all of her ups and downs emotionally it's not just like she's,0.23296475
born she's a perfect fighter she's a superhero nobody can touch her she's not a,0.38267177
Mary Sue that term that describes someone who's just perfect at everything a lot of,0.10303714
people complain about ray in the force awakens that this very self-sufficient character that had,0.09409231
virtually no flaws that's very much so not the case in Wonder Woman this isn't,0.115971476
just about empowerment like this perfect person who hates men and doesn't like men and,0.5876557
men suck it's actually a very equal movie which is something I was really excited,0.88824683
about because I really didn't want to watch another Ghostbusters movie where the entire time,0.0740466
I'm just reminded about how horrible I am because I'm a man this actually it's,0.22376907
very much so the opposite of that which brings me to Chris Pine their chemistry,0.1028064
is amazing they both learn from each other and their relationship in the film went,0.03952107
to emotional Heights that I did not expect and I was genuinely touched by the,0.09365379
end of the film I was really into that aspect of the movie which was,0.0758262
a major surprise and I found myself really caring but he brings a lot to,0.058865357
the movie he's not just some guy that she's constantly saving because he's some weak,0.4255619
guy like he actually brings quite a bit to her character and her to him,0.14583822
they both really learn from each other and there's a lot of times in the,0.08247248
movie where patty Jenkins and the screenwriter they took the time to have smaller moments,0.09898851
there's a scene where he teaches her how to dance and it really means a,0.122715935
lot for their characters but it's also the type of quiet small moment you don't,0.053738005
normally get in movies like this and it makes their relationship so much more fleshed,0.07753624
out and there's a lot of scenes like that I won't get into any spoilers,0.10077242
but there's a lot of times where the movie does slow down and lets these,0.1110566
characters just be people it's not just a mindless series of action scenes there's quite,0.19555233
a bit of action in it and when the action is going down my god,0.12877078
it's satisfying there's a lot of tiny action moments but there's like three major set,0.056856234
pieces in each act there's an incredible sequence on her homeland an amazing world war,0.35483852
one sequence and of course the big epic finale that finale did get a little,0.07699366
CGI heavy and it reminded me of some of the doomsday stuff in the end,0.06893447
of VBS for some people that might be a turn-off but here I thought it,0.37264764
was handled considerably better in regards to the way it was all cut together there,0.043076284
is a lot of CGI and that's to be expected because Wonder Woman is not,0.248735
normal so that kind of shit's going to happen but since I actually cared about,0.87281644
the characters this time around I didn't mind as much when it got CGI heavy,0.09570493
my biggest gripe with Wonder Woman is pretty much the same one I've had with,0.14169796
most superhero movies as of late whether it's Marvel or DC and that's the villain,0.15247771
characters they're pretty weak there's like two or three in this movie and some of,0.15531802
them are just so poorly underdeveloped and they feel very hammy which doesn't really fit,0.55263263
in with the rest of the movie and that was a major disappointment for me,0.10375125
the movie is really long but I think it works for this character you really,0.08274305
needed to see her upbringing her roots where she came from why she is the,0.31089434
way she is it wasn't just a bunch of padded scenes and they also wisely,0.14886655
understood which elements of her origin to poke fun at which things sounded silly enough,0.69542736
to make a joke out of it and so it wasn't just it was kind,0.105522916
of like the way they did it with for like Thor has some really silly,0.5329758
and cheesy origins and they found ways to poke fun at it and make it,0.22343245
entertaining enough so that you could at least get a joke out of it I,0.18614636
talked about it briefly but some of the action scenes are genuinely epic like the,0.05865179
very definition of epic the score is also really exciting and I'm looking forward to,0.06334668
buying it all in all Wonder Woman is pretty much exactly what I would want,0.15026103
out of a Wonder Woman movie I am so happy to say that this is,0.12778373
the first great DC EU movie and I had a blast with it the villain,0.31089434
characters could be better this isn't like the best DC movie since the Dark Knight,0.046133123
I would say The Dark Knight Rises is probably still a better film but this,0.05280977
is a blast it's really fun also colorful this is a really colorful movie it's,0.09878501
not be saturated and depressing there's a ton of colors in almost every scene which,0.13922481
oh my god just colors people they really matter I'm going to give Wonder Woman,0.16140954
an A - I really did have a blast with this one guys and I,0.23513313
