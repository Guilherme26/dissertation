and return to help save the resistance meanwhile the first order is attempting to end,0.07852391
the resistance once and for all and that's all I'm gonna say about the plot,0.08496658
and the setup because this is a spoiler free review and I will be putting,0.14238293
out a spoiler full review on Sunday with that said the last Jedi was good,0.117856495
but it left me with so many mixed feelings now before I dive into my,0.17993228
full thoughts be sure to put your thoughts down below in the comment section tell,0.12803984
me what you liked what you hated about it but avoid spoilers in the comment,0.17854425
section on this particular video also stick around to the end of this video to,0.13715278
learn how you might be able to appear in one of my future videos using,0.11662902
the start of staff with that said let's start talking about the best things about,0.06084194
this movie the best thing about this film is it's a character based film where,0.07580271
each of the characters have a journey thereon of discovery and there's a great performance,0.03139743
backing that journey that they are on this might be the best we've ever seen,0.09936701
Mark Hamill in this role and maybe ever in his entire acting career Carrie Fisher,0.11295582
gives another amazing performance it just has such sadness in the character as she's seeing,0.07559782
the world around her as she's fighting for hope once again Daisy Ridley is charming,0.1584981
as she's ever been has met all these characters seem to be pretty charming and,0.092382744
likable in these roles Brian Johnson brings possibly the most unique and distinct directorial style,0.053394277
that we've seen in any Star Wars movie thus far with angles he uses the,0.07597942
look of it and this is a gorgeous looking movie the action is shot with,0.106133595
wide angles you can see what's happening in the lightsaber battles there's little distinct things,0.08237019
and our space battles and our land battles that just give them a unique look,0.06743859
and that's all Ryan Johnson's action and this is a movie that avoids the tendency,0.06279217
of most sequels to just go bigger better bigger equals better it doesn't do that,0.06712222
and while the stakes are more dire than ever and you feel the danger of,0.14219782
everything happening it's not because they're just making everything bigger whereas in previous Star Wars,0.07368339
movies planets what star systems are destroyed there are death stars and star killer bases,0.1497681
this movie doesn't escalate stakes by just going bigger and makes it more personal and,0.05687517
it's directed in such a way that you actually fear that something bad could happen,0.13694307
throughout the whole movie you just feel like the resistance could fall apart at any,0.09407704
time our good guys could turn to the dark side at any point in time,0.10847312
it in that regard it's very much like Empire Strikes Back in that the story's,0.050550446
not gigantic but it's personal and it matters in that regard it's very much like,0.09632056
Empire Strikes Back because the scope is smaller it's more personal but for some reason,0.058641743
the stakes seems so much greater than they did before from there let's move on,0.054705657
to the parts that I had mixed feelings about this film constantly goes against your,0.24233414
expectations and then at the movies very unpredictable but it feels like it's unpredictable for,0.07609807
the purpose of being unpredictable for the sake of being unpredictable in that regard sometimes,0.07039032
it feels hollow like moments will happen where you think there's gonna be substance to,0.10495535
it something really unpredictable happens and you don't feel the emotional weight that you should,0.15250604
feel there the audience had a reaction like oh that was shocking but you didn't,0.05345905
feel substance to it it just felt like they were actively trying to go against,0.09944417
whatever you thought was gonna happen or what could have happened just to make sure,0.058293298
that the movie was unpredictable and in that I appreciated that it didn't play into,0.04730974
what we expected or what we wanted then who took twists and turns but at,0.043271128
the same time they didn't pay off the way I felt like they should have,0.08086643
the film also plays a good bit of homage to the Empire Strikes Back and,0.011962373
Return of the Jedi now what it doesn't do is use those films as a,0.123032756
template like the force awakens did but there was a lot of stuff that felt,0.109591864
a little bit too familiar some of them was good perhaps and some of it,0.12843348
felt a little bit too much like okay we have to have an element like,0.122836806
this from one of these two movies and you could just feel where scenes were,0.08189683
going because it was playing so much homage to previous films also the humor in,0.039137166
this movie was a little bit mixed certainly I laughed out loud it added a,0.17512025
levity to a movie that had a lot of weight to it and a lot,0.272772
of Arcanist to it but the jokes didn't land as well as they did in,0.06891012
the force awakens a lot more of them felt forced some of them felt like,0.0877865
they were callbacks to the previous movie it was like I don't think we need,0.059139132
to do this I'm cringing a little bit at how much you're trying to be,0.15221956
JJ Abrams type funny speaking of JJ Abrams some of the mystery box type stuff,0.111958
that was set up in the previous film this movie doesn't embarrass itself by trying,0.15388623
to give answers that don't work but it feels like it kind of shifts away,0.08934558
and avoids answering some of those questions and so is the level pretty mixed bag,0.12271239
on a lot of different things with this move it wasn't like I hate this,0.1888509
it's not that loo that's really bad it was just kind of like okay that,0.13151295
doesn't fully work as well as I think it should have and with that said,0.06507568
from there let's move on to the worst aspects of this film and by far,0.195641
the worst thing about this movie is a plotline involving Finn that just feels unnecessary,0.24115871
now in one sense it is necessary because it kind of links together a few,0.0667274
plot points in it but you feel throughout the whole thing like ooh you could,0.06673343
have found a much smoother way to do this without having this gigantic rabbit trail,0.15543742
that's the least interesting thing about this movie like every time that we go off,0.11043069
to cutaway to this other adventure you're thinking man I wish I was back with,0.14923212
Luke and Rey man I wish it was with kylo Ren right now and it's,0.15078644
not interesting even the the design of the world where things kind of take place,0.1143808
and the characters there is some of the most bland stuff in any Star Wars,0.1175797
movie ever you're just like wow this feels so la and possibly because of this,0.1445126
subplot this movie is way too long for the type of story that's being told,0.06879719
I mean the movie has a fairly straightforward narrative in the movies the longest Star,0.049379613
Wars movie that's ever been put out and that's because you've got a few too,0.16758114
many subplots going on and some of them are way too long and unnecessary for,0.11391637
the type of movie that's being told here and you feel that weight as the,0.12465264
movie goes along and since so much stuff is going on it feels like the,0.07140729
movie takes a long time to get started and while the stakes of the movie,0.05874292
give a sense of urgency to it the environments and shots are used make the,0.096142694
movie feel like it's not moving forward like there's several points in time where there's,0.05074206
establishing shots that feel like haven't we seen this exact establishing shot four or five,0.1689574
times already as it cuts back and forth between the three kind of plot lines,0.063790426
that are going on also the script frequently uses miscommunication or bad communication as a,0.087764256
way to kind of move the story forward and create conflict but the end result,0.07078221
is feeling a little bit like if people had just communicated information that they could,0.13441087
have communicated you could have avoided big gigantic dire consequences and that's not really addressed,0.06718421
within the movie and so it kind of popped out to me like shouldn't that,0.10078488
have been addressed or should we come up with a better reason that they didn't,0.060105473
have certain information so overall this is a movie that I did enjoy I do,0.08613123
think it's a good movie but it is a movie that leaves you with all,0.13022655
kinds of feelings that are all over the place that kind of demands additional viewings,0.054507244
and for that reason I'm not gonna put my rating in the movie just yet,0.15302326
I'll put a rating on my spoiler review that I'm gonna put out on Sunday,0.2817536
I have a pretty good idea where it's landing amongst all of the Star Wars,0.06503263
movies but it's giving a score to it so that you guys will hold me,0.12527817
to in the future I want to hold off just a little bit until I,0.27111354
have a second viewing and if I'm being honest you need to go see this,0.058872543
movie it is a Star Wars movie it is a good Star Wars movie it's,0.08094209
not one of the best Star Wars movies but it's a solid addition to the,0.06038366
franchise then we'll definitely elicit a response from you and in my case I need,0.12736842
to see it a second time before I can fully decide how I want to,0.053650584
score this one so those are my initial thoughts on the movie here's what some,0.08444317
of you guys are saying about it this was fantastic I mean everything the tension,0.1973565
the suspense the humor if I'm being completely honest after one viewing I'm slightly underwhelmed,0.06060047
and don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but for me it just felt like,0.09838416
a series of really great moments that never quite came together to form a cohesive,0.083682865
story in a word last Jedi is unpredictable um I loved it definitely go out,0.07111457
