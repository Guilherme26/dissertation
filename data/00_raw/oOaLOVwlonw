[Music] what is happening Magnus sites so I'm going into Dunkirk it was very excited I know this is not hooked up to my camera okay ah I'm Christopher Nolan fan uh you know enjoying the Dark Knight trilogy inception so I was in there and he had my full trust over time I've enjoyed war movies like Full Metal Jacket Saving Private Ryan C glory warhorse Wonder Woman these are all born movies or at least set in war periods based on a real defense and when I walked out of the theater I looked on my phone to see what Rotten Tomatoes had to suggest curious I never did give a damn with rod Clemson because it was my opinion bob was curious and when I saw the score I would woo okay alright well every man is entitled to his opinion and I did not enjoy this movie I'm not sure if it's a quote unquote history buff movie in other words of those who are very very excited about history history wasn't my thing in high school I never really cared for history I was a major science buff so that was one thing I was majorly interested in science by Alan nature I always ace those courses but 1776 and stuff like that just didn't like I was born not to mean that history is boring history can be made to be very stimulating and interesting to learn and I remember when the first trailer came out and I enjoyed that trailer and many of you said oh yeah check out the story of Dunkirk and a lot of people from the UK we're like telling me different stuff about it in the comments you know sorry okay I was like oh okay I found this resume okay cool but when that bring you not clicked a couple of links read about it so I went into this knowing a little about what what happened I enjoyed myself I would say for the first half hour started off rather like oh [ __ ] okay oh wow okay oh right whoa-oh-oh-oh whoo we made it alright and after that things just seemed to be very slow um no I just was not stimulated in this movie I didn't go into it expecting a big firefight movie and a ton of action I wasn't expecting that but for some reason I just was not because there's plenty of movies that I watched you know while my personality speaks to people that watch me on YouTube as being a guy that likes comedy or action only I'm not that type of guy all the time you know they trust me I'm smart enough to keep up with 99% of y'all intellectually and you know I like a very stimulating movie something that makes me think or something that catches my attention to drama the storytelling but for some reason I was bored um I felt though that he captured the tone of the situation very well the movie looked like a Nolan movie there were certain Nolan actors that we are used to seeing in his movies that were in it Tom Hardy was one of the heroes of the movie I thought he played that part well or sometimes when he spoke where I was like that a little bit of bang I felt like I heard a little bit of Bane in there I did like the firefights the dogfights with the planes some of the things that went on with the bombings and the soldiers trying to get to safety stuff like that there was a certain part that we're kind of lost me I was like all they read that was be retold in they caught up to this part okay okay okay there is a particular character that did die I was like man that surprised me and I was like I was better fed but as a whole um I guess I was just bored and I don't like to be bored my go-to movie I can't like I said I can't say it wasn't shot well and maybe the storytelling was done well but for some reason as far as I'm concerned for me I was bored you know and I don't like to talk bad about any movies by a director that I like and uh you know like you pained me to talk about transformers 5 and how much I hated it because I loved Michael Bay to do lives next night a little Christopher Nolan a little James Cameron yeah there's a lot of different the righteous love that at work but it doesn't mean I'm gonna like every single things so I don't like doing it because I feel a camaraderie with like I'm there I could almost like their friend now your friend does something and you use soem village right yeah and you say whatever it is they do we're going to show you and give me emulate you only don't want her defense that's how I feel when it's busy director even an actor comes out with a movie that I really like love and then I don't really care for the movie like two guys that were sitting together were clapping at the end so the movie bus I mean not movie thoughts well maybe movie bus like history books maybe there was just like hottest cold personally or whatever I don't know there was a certain point I was just waiting for it to be over you know so I'm going to have to give this for me because I was bored to out five Woo's I wouldn't watch again I wasn't go see it again I wasn't ready I'm not saying it was bad I'm saying it was I was bored you know there's a difference between there being a bad movie it wasn't bad I was just bored you know what I'm saying that I've seen play I've seen movies where a nothing but dialogue and storytelling and character development all that stuff and I've been interested for some reason is doing interesting I guess I've seen other movie war movies are interested me but this for some reason didn't what captured being is that it was no one directing it and Hardy was going to be in it and as a war movie let's go check it out that's that's what got me to go see it but other than that I just I just couldn't get into it so closely comments down below let me know what you all thought if you enjoy my movie
