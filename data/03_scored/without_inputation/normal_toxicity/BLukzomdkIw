some of the morning Hague a tribute are going well and today we are reviewing Christopher Nolan's World War two film Dunkirk and right up there with the big Marvel releases this was easily my most anticipated film of all the studio summer blockbusters and really it was not at all what I was expecting in the best possible way it's a war film yes but without that classic Hollywood heightened movie gore thrill of the battlefield,0.09996231
but that doesn't mean it's not still edge-of-your-seat thrillingly 10 so written and directed by Christopher Nolan Dunkirk is a place in France,0.06814272
but here historically and military in 1940,0.12398656
"it's known as the site where some 400,000 British soldiers were being pushed out of France by the enveloping Nazi army told to us through different perspective from the land from the sea and also from the air we see a crisscross of interweaving characters these men have already experienced all the horrors of war",0.23959962

you haven't got that familiar classic Hollywood genre our beginning middle and end for audiences to get a sense of bearing about my friend who I saw,0.06909145
this was described it as feeling like one long continuous scene because it is just relentless in its focus these soldiers are just trying to do what they can to stay alive as the enemy is picking them off methodically across all fronts,0.12562567
there is no sense of calm or safety for any of the soldiers nor is there for the audience the cinematography is from Kosovo,0.08352941

it is so concentrated and clear there isn't an over bloating of dialogue which means that there is room for an incredible sound design and a score which is non-stop,0.074811324
it's a metronome of the story it's so tense and ticking the whole time that when there is silence it's so stark,0.10800399

now Nolan often likes to play around and explore with passage of time in his film,0.105039835
and here in Dunkirk,0.0514021
there are some non-linear moments of storytelling where all repetitions are seen from different POVs which can be a little bit disorientating at times it kind of did take me out it does throw you around a little bit just trying to figure out where you are in the story or what has happened to that character or what is about to happen,0.14531264
if it's like a repetition of a scene from someone else's point of view Dunkirk was not the typical Hollywood action war film that I was expecting to see it was so much better it was a war film without the blood and guts but still with all the intensity guides they are my thoughts on the film of Dunkirk,0.14929026
