love the criterion man that's a beautiful cover it's so creepy and haunting and it's,0.28518045
oh man i love these covers so rebecca was released in 1940 this was directed,0.115278326
of course by alfred hitchcock it was based on an acclaimed novel by i think,0.2723231
it says on here her name is daphne dumouria based on her novel and this,0.27576488
was alfred hitchcock's first hollywood production alfred hitchcock was already a successful director in britain,0.33730265
he had made a lot of well-regarded british cinema in the 1930s with films such,0.09732008
as the man who knew too much the 39 steps and the lady vanishes hollywood,0.11086609
was starting to pay attention to alfred hitchcock's talents particularly david selznick who was hot,0.4033156
off the success of recent best picture winner and at the time the highest grossing,0.05928754
film of all time gone with the wind and so they ended up working together,0.06613083
on rebecca hitchcock's first hollywood production rebecca while not as monumental of a success has,0.2406578
gone in the wind was still a huge hit as well especially for putting hitchcock,0.44475543
on the map to talk to a larger wider audience than what he was doing,0.07054932
in england i am moving to hollywood got him a lot more attention from a,0.10420772
wider variety of film fans and moving into the us actually paid off as rebecca,0.0818107
won some academy awards as well particularly best picture and because of that alfred hitchcock,0.44523484
ended up making more signature films that really signified his talents creating iconic classics that,0.08401232
are still beloved to this day like their window vertigo north by northwest psycho the,0.3508703
birds none of these movies wouldn't be possible without rebecca so this is a very,0.089689896
influential film in hitchcock's filmography a very game-changing film in his filmography is it still,0.061087273
a masterpiece this very day let's find out together doing rebecca joan fontaine plays a,0.064284034
young woman who believes she has found her heart's desire when she marries the dashing,0.15550773
aristocratic whether were maxim de winter but upon moving into manderlay her groom's baroque ancestral,0.16254495
mansion she soon learns that his deceased wife rebecca haunts not only the estate but,0.14606576
the temperamental brooding maxim as well and besides joan fontaine this movie also stars lawrence,0.08462686
olivier george sanders judith anderson and gladys cooper so this was the first time i,0.31089434
had seen rebecca in a few years back when i was starting to get into,0.08094948
classic cinema i think about eight years ago now uh rebecca was one of the,0.074215405
first alfred hitchcock films ever watched i distinctly remember the first two alfred hitchcock films,0.36714557
i remembered watching rebecca and the birds the birds being the very first and rebecca,0.04782443
was one of the first hitchcock films i remember watching as well i was intrigued,0.1823117
to get into that one because i knew that it was the only alfred hitchcock,0.53124005
film to win best picture and i wanted to see what made the academy love,0.07632127
the film so much and watching rebecca it's pretty easy to see why i think,0.07492907
this is one of the more melodramatic films in hitchcock's filmography i guess because hitchcock,0.31089434
paired with david selznick who just did gone with the win this sweeping melodramatic epic,0.1958891
film one of the best films of its era and so him pairing with alfred,0.060426943
hitchcock to create a melodramatic romance but also very gothic and very psychological as well,0.43559194
i think they were a great pair now hitchcock has later come out and said,0.49487343
he was a little dissatisfied with the making of rebecca he didn't get full creative,0.12245036
control like he did in his later films he definitely had some tension with selznick,0.24236758
throughout the making of the film selznick wanted to do some things hitchcock want to,0.27507862
do some things and so there was a little bit of a tension between the,0.11319661
two but i don't feel any tension watching the film i feel like in the,0.065903515
final version of the film there's still a great balance between the psycho drama that,0.24244438
makes hitchcock films rewarding mixed with the melodrama that made uh david selznick a prominent,0.24076708
producer back at the time uh back in the day and i think it's a,0.054276288
pretty good match uh the cinematography in this film is very haunting throughout very atmospheric,0.07330163
and very gothic i really love the way uh the movie makes you feel the,0.08789386
presence of somebody who's never really on screen this rebecca character the former wife of,0.08409571
maxim who tragically died and everybody's comparing her to the new wife that joan fontaine,0.2867291
is playing and it just makes for a very unsettling film it's not a scary,0.100443445
film by any means it's more of a psychological thriller that where the fear in,0.11947181
the film is upon expectations it falls upon obsession it falls upon expectations where you're,0.061505668
trying to do your own thing but everybody's comparing you to somebody that they think,0.15699293
is better and that just makes for a very very creepy experience at times especially,0.12163059
the housekeeper character mrs danvers played by judith anderson we as soon as you see,0.12391105
her on screen she is one creepy woman very much obsessed with rebecca has like,0.53490317
a her own room shrine dedicated to this woman there's a little bit of creepy,0.53490317
undertones to her character when you're like how did this make it past the sensors,0.08783669
some of the stuff she says and the stuff she keeps but she is so,0.09529962
good in this role she's probably the scene stealer of rebecca because of how creepy,0.322675
she is you also got like i said jim fontaine plays the young woman who,0.15390095
marries lawrence olivier and is struggling to do her own thing as the new wife,0.07867221
while struggling to learn more about the mystery of who rebecca was and why people,0.07041784
are obsessed with her and then there's a lot of crazy twists as well between,0.46786574
her relationship to maxim lawrence olivier there's a lot of good twists in this film,0.1539103
uh the romance in the film is uh pretty compelling throughout between joan and lawrence,0.059879076
olivier horns olivier is so good as maxim very much one of the best dramatic,0.10929521
actors of that time who committed to every role that he was in in such,0.11326344
a theatrical presence and it's another remarkable performance here in rebecca the very brooding shy,0.09239493
man struggling to cope with a loss so severe while also trying to find new,0.12720606
love and move on as well movie moves at a pretty good pace it's a,0.052815028
little bit slow at times and it's run time because of the nature of the,0.16369452
story but it all leads to a very rewarding payoff in the end i did,0.048790194
enjoy the twists and turns in regards to what really happened the the mystery surrounding,0.06702576
rebecca's death and what was really going on and what lawrence olivier's true feelings and,0.31089434
regards are and then uh some of the other mysterious figures that have had a,0.04684562
connection to rebecca there's another character that claims to be her cousin who is played,0.06672987
by george sanders if you're a disney fan you may know him as the voice,0.13874845
of sheer khan in the jungle book he shows up in the film and he's,0.12576228
pretty entertaining as well i enjoyed his small part as somebody that has his own,0.14910124
agenda and trying to solve the rebecca death and he has an interesting connection with,0.19440457
her as well which i'm not going to spoil but definitely want to take the,0.15029073
cousin term lightly here that's all i'm going to say the movie is very well,0.09038228
scored it has a very eerie score throughout and while this movie is not as,0.06780473
suspenseful or as intense as some of hitchcock's later films i do agree that when,0.29489708
hitchcock got full creative control he made some of the best movies of the golden,0.3613784
age of hollywood like look to psycho and vertigo rear window and some of the,0.34600124
very very best alfred hitchcock films but he was getting his start in hollywood i,0.24135442
get that and his first hollywood production still really good i did enjoy the mix,0.15867707
of the psycho drama the melodrama the gothic atmosphere it's still an excellent atmospheric watch,0.31089434
i don't know if it would have been my pick for best picture that year,0.07788404
because 1940 i know the great dictator came out that year i love that film,0.24082394
from charlie chaplin uh the grapes are raph is another excellent drama that came out,0.1540884
that year i like those movies a little bit more than rebecca and i think,0.116770655
they probably would have been my picks for best picture one of the two of,0.04744008
course the academy doesn't care for animation films if if it was a truly fair,0.09512517
year like pinocchio or fantasia should have been in there in the running as well,0.14415099
but rebecca is a really great film nonetheless it's one of my favorite alfred hitchcock,0.4305946
films i know it's not the best alfred hitchcock film but i'm strangely attracted to,0.16573031
it and i think it's because of the atmosphere the atmosphere in this film really,0.08937379
sells the movie for me and every time i've rewatched it i've really really dug,0.14149754
it and i do appreciate rebecca even more on every rewatch that i see of,0.0943292
it so if you have not seen rebecca and if you're an alfred hitchcock fan,0.54035693
this is a good film to check out your enjoyment of the film depends on,0.04423941
i guess your experience with it but for me this is one of the best,0.07687672
out for hitchcock films probably in my top 10 i don't know um i haven't,0.34658903
seen all alfred hitchcock's film but this is a really good one and i'm going,0.15526068
