hello everybody I am Tiffany and today I am doing another movie review let's go,0.063941926
I'm kind of dressed up right not really nice no stuff as I would like,0.23951198
to be you because I was really trying to get specific items I kind of,0.06292689
find anywhere but I really need to do this movie review before is I completely,0.08824611
escape to my head this is just going to have to do it's not really,0.09512852
an outfit at all but the color kind of fits it I guess I don't,0.15409169
know maybe it doesn't but to me it does so that's what's important is that,0.060914982
in my heart I meant for it to match this movie the movie I am,0.10644964
discussing and reviewing today is Logan the new x-men movie that came out a little,0.15168045
while ago I didn't see it where he was actually in theaters which is really,0.050148513
sad because I work at the movie theatres and it was in theaters while I've,0.06653014
been working there but did I go see it no I didn't good job' but,0.07081575
I saw it on on-demand and decided to watch it with me Familia and you,0.21024975
have a really fun time I was super excited I love superhero movies I'm not,0.10446674
like super up-to-date on comics or anything like that so I don't pretend to be,0.14864857
like the super duper fans who like read the comics along with it and they,0.12833136
know exactly what comic is face office I'm not that but I do enjoy superhero,0.14950986
movies and I have people who have read the comics and they kind of catch,0.088960126
me up on the backstory of stuff that they don't live in the movies so,0.1098966
in the excellent franchise this was a very special movie because I believe in a,0.059410594
huge Ackman last movie is Wolverine it kind of makes sense that it would be,0.07089281
if you've seen it you know what I mean and then will be lived up,0.16061044
to the epicness like it should because Hugh Jackman is awesome and is there's an,0.084641986
awesome final last movie of Wolverine because he's done an excellent job with that role,0.1047601
so Hugh Jackman fabulous job if you couldn't tell by that I loved this movie,0.12116268
it was so good very intense it is definitely a darker take on the comics,0.094772436
marvel is usually very light and fun and has a little bit of humor in,0.05166596
it has dramatic moments but is known more for their lighter side and the more,0.052670565
action side and does have plenty of action trust me it has a lot of,0.05847084
action sequences in there but it also has a more soul and darker tone there,0.058653492
aren't a lot of funny moments really very very few there's very few in this,0.055235747
it's kind of like dark night a little bit you're not going in there to,0.4033652
have a happy-go-lucky time it was definitely a very intense movie it's at I can,0.050014716
definitely see people crying in this so bring tissues just in case and all the,0.20635322
characters are just so awesome you have a couple returning you have new ones a,0.06332697
lot of new ones for those of you who won sophistic it has an eight,0.49474993
point three out of ten on IMDB do you know how insane that is it,0.4647741
is on IMDB top 250 movies now you know how hard that is to do,0.15192224
oh my gosh that means that there is another movie out there that was on,0.12094388
that list that was 250 and it's up folks I'm sorry I'm so sorry to,0.07410263
that movie I'm pretty sure you are fantastic I have a lot of superhero movies,0.1942194
on that list a whole lot there's a couple there's blogan now big Avengers Dark,0.06110938
Knight I just know those three for sure that are on that list for those,0.045887124
of you who want to know the actors it starts of course Hugh Jackman as,0.10279445
Wolverine who else DA has Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier as you always is and,0.117167614
it also introduces a new actress Daphne King soon amazing job oh my gosh love,0.12042246
her so young she's so awesome has a lot of awesome other people in it,0.086877294
too I would HIGHLY highly highly recommend this again if you are looking for a,0.041221276
happier movie this is not the best route to go it's not going to make,0.08263015
you feel happy and warm and bubbly after you leave it's going to make you,0.3033956
feel kind of depressed I feel like super duper like bawling your eyes out half,0.40635514
an hour later but still depressed and potentially a couple tears well the plot of,0.11283745
the thurible if you see in the x-men movies it follows of course the Wolverine,0.106421076
on the story you had a couple standalone movies as well before this one this,0.11010795
one cuts to many many many years in the future when stuff has gone awry,0.059726264
I don't really want to spoil you too much you should really go into this,0.1955808
blind and not really what's happening but the main thing you should know is that,0.14744745
it is many many many many many years into the future so that's why things,0.054894257
seem really different it's not like this has happened a year or two from the,0.07024864
last movie is action drama sci fi has been born at a time it's not,0.11506484
bad or really at all so don't worry about that so if you like action,0.15293065
yes you'll love it if you don't like action well just watch it anyways for,0.1473355
the story because the story is amazing it's really all I can tell you without,0.071648985
completely spoiling you so I'm going to go ahead and jump into the spoilery section,0.53219897
okay thank you for joining me today non spoilery people go watch Logan and then,0.1536864
come back and we can talk about all the fields and everything on it together,0.076702684
have a good day goodbye I know it's not supposed but you know why I,0.07140621
made up one so I don't have the clause I really want a clause so,0.06955569
I went into this expecting it to be bad because I have been warned at,0.14686322
least of that that it is very dark and depressing compared to the other x-men,0.2672239
movies and that's totally fine you need those dark night moments especially in comic book,0.09225061
movies because those are so bright so deep if you're not expected to be as,0.18959813
depressing as it was I gotta say and the engine shocked me I got a,0.14915267
bit hit hope that says automatically at the beginning is just that this very curious,0.10191356
depressing town because the very opening scene is of course Wolverine is getting attacked by,0.2403893
these guys who are trying to steal his car which is a very dumb move,0.76968324
and he's fighting them but just something seems off he's not healing as fast and,0.14907415
he seems to be hurting more than usual when the guys hit him for just,0.2905927
kind of wondering the whole time what exactly happened to the x-men and why isn't,0.051773325
he at the school teaching why is he a driver now and everything like that,0.075787514
it's really really confusing it was just so depressing because I was kind of excited,0.15539841
because I was really hoping that I would see some of the other x-men in,0.1347459
this movie but you basically find out right at the beginning that all the rest,0.09191609
of them are dead and it's really Wolverine and Charles Xavier and the creepy guy,0.49139938
who can hunt down mutants Calvin Calvin Gus's name Calvin and you find out there,0.16801736
hasn't either then mutant children in the 25 years or something like that and you're,0.29592532
just like what's going on what happened where's magneto and sore and Cyclops we just,0.116044946
goes back and but it's really there what if he cycle but he's dead again,0.3037538
oh gosh oh I was really sad and on top of that you find out,0.23975904
Professor X is having these seizures that basically can kill everybody so that's really fun,0.6518406
too I did find out information that was interesting because you know I have friends,0.054543573
who read the comics and everything and so I was actually informed that in the,0.058687035
comics I mean they hand shattered they never fully said it but it was Professor,0.24025959
X in one of the comments that actually kill are the x-men because he had,0.32795495
one of those seizures and the Wolverine could heal himself so he was okay but,0.09773799
the rest of them couldn't so they all ended up dying and I wasn't thinking,0.44565654
into that but I did hear that in the actual comics that Wolverine is the,0.057114474
one that kills them all I don't know if any of you guys have read,0.75839096
the comics but if you have you can talk about it below a little bit,0.14829224
because I'd like to know that in more detail because I'm not going to hunt,0.15278336
down those comics and figure out exactly what happened so it's that stuff I like,0.106062725
but like lip spoiler can't email people don't want to read about the comics themselves,0.09842845
and don't want to be spoiled for them and then you find out that there,0.14531706
are other mutant children out there you come across Laura who is played by Daphne,0.2651101
was amazing amazing Wolverine takes her in and promises to get her to this place,0.17072824
called Eden but you're kind of wondering this whole time what is her power exactly,0.09028307
and I was like shocked when I found out that she basically is Wolverine junior,0.093234584
girl version and she's more enhanced in a way because she had claws coming out,0.3705293
of her feet Wolverine only has at hand she has them in her feet too,0.12419429
I was like wait a second did Wolverine have a kick I was really confused,0.09913851
I did not expect that to be her power out of everything so I was,0.09498625
freaking out and thinking it was awesome and she was awesome like those fight sequences,0.31089434
that she had especially at the beginning when they attack them in Mexico oh my,0.46023974
god that was so good almost time to watch her because she's just a little,0.13736457
little spunky thing and she's gonna grow little new it's really cool and I wish,0.5039584
I had those girls a little bit but I don't and then the whole time,0.37109387
I was like okay so she's gotta be boring kid healthy sorta miss but isn't,0.32842222
she's like a clone actually did not but I was ed said that he had,0.267721
a kid and I was like this is gene great kid I'm gonna cut up,0.24119718
I have these psychic powers along with the claws like I was determined for life,0.089495175
to happen because if you don't know who she and gray is because you haven't,0.167965
left me other x-men movies for some reason she's the main love interest for loking,0.28020087
he's with Cyclops technically and she never breaks up the Cyclops never will but Logan,0.099109255
has a crush on her and wants to be with her there's been a gap,0.48865852
since the last movie and this one and she was alive last time I saw,0.12966427
because they revs arrested her and everything does that mean that they had a kid,0.2536631
and he didn't know about and the kid got captured I was going down that,0.09588547
hole and I erupted that is not true family but I really wanted it to,0.15160726
be true which is bad because I love Cyclops at the same time I wanted,0.15198681
her to actually be Logan daughter that's why I just really wanted to actually be,0.13775139
looking sorry and Professor X didn't help because he's like that's your daughter Logan and,0.262703
I'm like oh I'm right I'm right but no find out that you have all,0.09840634
of these young mutant kids that were in this facility and being tortured and basically,0.5529019
turned into weapons and then they escaped and are heading off to eat in logan,0.09108726
task now is to bring laura to eating and he has to bring professor x,0.23676604
with him which is scary in itself because his seizures and everything and i loved,0.27516165
how the movie didn't because i didn't know when they were going to happen but,0.06793227
he did it so well in moments where you were just not expecting it at,0.11455833
all like the main one was when they were in that hotel he has the,0.071955614
seizure all of a sudden and you see everybody's like frozen and the whole time,0.12406596
you're just watching Logan struggle to try and get to that hotel room so he,0.1539537
can stop professor eggs from killing everybody that's being probably tortured me out of all,0.68820053
the other scene you're just walking you move in and you're like can you move,0.23169473
just a little bit faster he couldn't move faster not like everybody's gonna die there's,0.46995658
gonna be a whole scene this is not okay and then the action sequence was,0.055943612
really cool because he comes in and he's like boom like that could have guys,0.15527198
and then they fall under dead and I was just like this is so cool,0.38509583
oh my gosh stop the seizure from happening please he just had a sense of,0.24502787
dread everywhere they went because when they hope that one family on the side of,0.07496664
the road I was kind of what Wolverine and I was like we should really,0.08290182
move on because I was gonna happen to the family the way this movie is,0.08926027
going and what do you know I was right though I did think for a,0.05318017
second that the kid was actually going to be another mutant you would see Laura's,0.18589664
like powers and then human be like oh my gosh look what I can do,0.25878963
and then he joins them or something like that I'm not sure but I do,0.10454517
not think all of them would survive I was clearly right I did not expect,0.14173509
to be their clone of Logan that is stronger and how he should be in,0.12533551
the sense and I was just terrified at that thing because asking was just plain,0.16139853
unstoppable it was it was scary okay you're not going to beat yourself I'm sorry,0.44328544
that other self is way stronger than you and then a shock came for me,0.41322953
at that moment though that thing that duplicate kills Professor X and I was so,0.3596068
mad I was like no we only have two people that are left in this,0.31089434
mutant world well three now but still I'll be original you're going to kill one,0.7763618
of those right now there is not okay and who is Professor X out of,0.10319523
all the people that you just killed I was so pissed and I was really,0.8049553
sad because he was dying and Logan was trying to save them but there was,0.115799546
nothing that Logan to do you know I'm like now it's just human Laura and,0.13108966
then Logan also knows that evening is actually a thing from the comics which was,0.034042783
frustrating I was like there's no such thing as hidden you gotta be kidding me,0.16920254
and I'm just panicking whew the whole entire time because I'm like they're gonna get,0.07155863
Laura and he's going to have to try down and this is not going to,0.08966408
be good ha is a better than that was me that was me during the,0.09235899
whole movie basically okay this was one comedic part for me was when Laura finally,0.044830907
speaks Logan Gibson because he's like you can't show off this whole entire time and,0.24805072
then she just goes on a rant in Spanish and I was laughing hysterically -,0.18584932
me / Laura you are awesome and kicking butt yes I loved it and then,0.8546587
also during all of the sudden happening you have this impending genome with Wolverine because,0.07774458
he's not healing well and that's really scary but you don't know exactly what is,0.13742228
going on with him and you don't know if they're going to make it but,0.11091428
of course they were able to get him to the Eden which was kind of,0.06156333
Eden but not really and the kids are the ones who end up nurturing him,0.101162225
back to health in a sense and you're just like yes okay everything's gonna be,0.31089434
okay Wolverines going to go let them protect them everything's going to be good and,0.08994
there's going to be a whole new little mutants game but then the last sequence,0.12605663
came up and oh my gosh I was super intense and heartbreaking and intense again,0.14289862
Laureen who wakes up and realizes that that these kids are going to get captured,0.092571914
and so Wolverine takes the medicine all at once which he was not supposed to,0.07996605
do and you have this moment of old Wolverine where he's so strong and unstoppable,0.10046024
and it's this really nice battle sequence because you have him and then you have,0.09870669
Laura both kicking butt together and working together and I know she's not his daughter,0.6779913
in a sense but it was like father and daughter working together then the medicine,0.09060595
starts to wear off and let's do the Logan clothes Dylan is dead and he's,0.17989452
beating him to a pulp and got run oh my gosh thought run was so,0.60510814
pitiful at the end and I was just like this is so fast I paced,0.17246659
disintegrating basically back to where he was at the beginning but work is so painful,0.15536304
to watch and so emotional because you see him fighting and you have all the,0.13482653
other mutants coming together they're so young but they're fighting for Wolverine to protect him,0.21553162
and for each other and they come together and finally repeat that stupid Logan clones,0.88567394
but the real low game is so injured that they cannot do anything for him,0.17003678
and you just have this such emotional tender moment between him and Laura where she's,0.07685173
crying and not wanting him to go away because he is her guy in a,0.3376796
sense you just don't realize fully what's going to happen until it does because I,0.14175239
don't know about you but in superhero movies I don't expect my main character to,0.11770217
die and so I'm like he's going to be okay they're going to have one,0.69546425
of the mutants like heal him or something and he's going to be fine and,0.15048999
he's going to lead them to the border and everything's going to be fine but,0.105064146
it wasn't okay I cried I literally cried because Wolverine died he's going to be,0.2759897
resurrected or something because that's what they did in Superman so what you'll be doing,0.18539354
with Wolverine but no they ended with him dying and I was just sitting there,0.1256022
in silence for a good ten minutes afterwards and hearing my mom go like that,0.31089434
did that was funny that saw me out of it that that was funny she,0.17726322
literally was really upset that he died in that with it and I tried to,0.26109287
explain her it was hit the last movie but she was like that's not okay,0.14013432
that he died and she walked away pretty angry that night that that was how,0.28984997
it ended with him suck all of them it's more than just him dying by,0.85054636
himself because a Wolverine has been a central figure of the x-men franchise for such,0.1828977
a long time and so that in itself is really hurtful but also knowing that,0.06785907
he was the last original x-men and the last original guys and this the stars,0.09766706
these whole new mutants which is cool and giving white to future x-men possibilities and,0.46893972
new mutants and everything but it's still so sad that all of the originals are,0.20323882
dead now ah I'm going to miss them and the thing about that character is,0.24159165
that it's such an iconic character there's not really anybody else I feel like that,0.060943503
can take Hugh Jackman's place as Wolverine I don't they are going to because I,0.11063737
know they're doing younger versions of some of the x-men people now like Cyclops and,0.19706914
Jean Grey Sansa Stark is Jean Grey people I don't know if they're actually going,0.13618301
to do a younger Wolverine look out of all the characters Hugh Jackman has been,0.084495135
the central figure of that and he's done so much with Wolverine and you've come,0.09536206
to his close but I'm guessing they're going to fill that gap basically between that,0.11192371
time and go back and refer a very and fill in some other time places,0.104911834
that they can because we're doing younger versions of everybody I will say I was,0.06538502
really sad that Wolverine died and that broke my heart but it was still a,0.14836961
really good send-off makes me want to go back to the beginning of x-men and,0.41085327
see everything he's done the best thank you Hugh Jackman from being an awesome awesome,0.059226092
Wolverine that is really all I have to say about this movie it was so,0.095822275
incredible very emotional intense has little cute moments has very very depressing moments but it's,0.18795736
still so good and a great send-off to Wolverine and what Hugh Jackman has done,0.121612296
with that character thank you so much for watching this if you have any other,0.05772433
book or movie recommendations you can leave them in the comments below and I'll write,0.13054374
them down check them out and make sure I do review on them for you,0.24071972
thank you so much for everything have a wonderful day evening night afternoon whatever time,0.07437363
of the day you are watching this end don't forget to be awesome and watch,0.12887609
Wolverine and if you have Wolverine claws oh my gosh show me them because I,0.26777956
want some like to put on the hip that'd be so much fun alright have,0.17472717
