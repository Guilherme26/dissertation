"Well, buddy, you, a fan Z here"
"Today's review is going to be for the 1952 movie Musical Singing in the Rain starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'connor and Julie Andrews"
"Now going into this movie, I am a fan of musicals and I had heard a lot of good things about this movie and how I was in Classic Now"
"Overall, it's a good movie, but it's not a great movie now"
Definitely the three main actors are the best reason to watch this
I thought Gene Kelly was good
"Julie Andrews was good, but I felt like my standout was Donnell O'connor as Cosmo Brown"
"I just felt like any time he was on screen eight elevated the movie a little bit more, maybe more interested, and I thought the story was good"
It was definitely easy to follow along with
Now on to the negatives
"Even though Julie Andrews was good, I just felt like she could have done a little bit more"
"and another big problem of mine is that the, even though the movie to a lot of people it's considered classic To me, it just isn't very memorable And it's not a movie that I would really watch that many more times And it's just yeah, There's just nothing very remarkable in the story"
It seemed just like you knew where it was going and all that
"Overall, I'm going to give this a three and a half out of five"
"Well, that is my review for the 19:52 would be musical, Singing in the Ring"
"This is move, fans E, signing off"
Have a good night
