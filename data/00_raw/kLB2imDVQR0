hey guys it's Mariana and today we're talking about Mad Max fury road this movie is directed by George Miller just like the previous three and it stars Tom Hardy Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult now I went into this movie with really high expectations because not only wasn't excited after watching the Mad Max trailers which I thought looked awesome and I never got tired of seeing those trailers but I also was really hyped up just all my own because I'm marathoned the first three Mad Max movies right before I went to see Mad Max fury road so I had pretty high expectations for this and this movie still blew my mind I am so excited about this movie that I can't even begin to tell you and I am obviously going to try to tell you because I'm doing a review but yeah I'm excited my first thought after the movie ended was how am I ever going to watch another action movie because this film was everything I wanted it to be and more the premise of this movie is pretty simple we have Tom Hardy as Mad Max who by the way looks fine who is captured by this group of really strange people who are ruled by a crazy looking dude with a skeleton mask on his face you probably remember him from the trailer you can't miss him he looks crazy and fun fact he's actually played by the same actor who played the villain in the first Mad Max movie which they're completely different people but it's still kind of eight so this group of people almost feels like a cult because they pretty much worship their leader and then one of the people there is Shirley's Erin's character furiosa and she is actually trying to get out of that situation and so we have her getting out the crazy people chasing her and Max is kind of just caught between the two sides now if you have never seen a Mad Max film before the trailer is a very accurate representation of this movie it is crazy chaotic insane post-apocalyptic action that's what this movie is I absolutely love the world George Miller created for the Mad Max franchise it is so weird and so crazy and if you're somebody who enjoys dystopian post-apocalyptic worlds I think you're going to find this fascinating there are so many crazy details and you can tell that every single thing and every single person in this world has some kind of function like they're not just there to look crazy they actually have a backstory and a reason to be there the action in this movie like I said before is mind-blowing it is beautiful first of all it looks realistic it looks like something that can actually happen it is not all green-screen CGI it looks amazing people get hurt things break not that it's great when people get hurt but you know what I mean like we don't have invincible characters which is so annoying in action films I was legitimately concerned about everybody in this movie because people then just walk things off second of all there's none of that shaky-cam stuff that is so annoying in movies these days you can see everything that's going on you can see these beautiful shots of chaos unfolding in front of you and there is this one particular scene that really had an effect on me for some reason because it was towards the beginning it is a scene where the characters go into a sandstorm and it just looks like all hell broke loose on earth this movie also has an amazing soundtrack which is something that I wondered about because often I see trailers using music that isn't actually in the movie and I can tell you that the epic music from the trailer is in the movie and it is stunning it just all fits together there's even a guy in this movie whose sole purpose is to stand on top of this truck while it's driving places and to play an electric guitar that also spits out fire occasionally that is how crazy this movie is and I was a big fan of this guy because that was just wild of course all of the actors did an amazing job Tom Hardy as Mad Max is really solid I really like Tom Hardy but I was a little bit concerned about him because Mel Gibson as Mad Max is excellent but I was pretty impressed Charlize Theron s furiosa is pretty much the ultimate badass and then Nicholas Hoult plays this really insane character it's great they all did a fantastic job I have nothing bad to say about this movie now the question that you might be asking yourself is whether or not you need to see the original three movies to watch Mad Max fury road and my answers is yes and no if you're concerned that you're going to be confused about what's going on like the plot is going to not make sense you don't need to see them this movie stands perfectly on its own however I would definitely recommend seeing the original three movies a because they're great movies well third ones kind of rocky but it still has really good moments be it's really interesting to observe the progression of this post-apocalyptic world because you can see things getting worse and worse with every movie and crazier and crazier so that's really interesting and in the second movie Mad Max road warrior you also get to see a little bit of the history of how things happened so if you're interested in that definitely see the first three movies and also you don't get as much character development with max in this particular movie they kind of go over his origins a little bit in the beginning however if you want to know how this guy went from a pretty normal person who was a reckless cop to this insane shell of a man you obviously need to watch the previous movies so for plot you don't really need to see them but you really should see them now guys because I'm apparently a very mean and demanding movie watcher and reviewer I have not given a single 5 out of 5 rating to a movie that I saw that came out this year and Mad Max fury road gets five out of five stars from me it happened that's it for my review obviously I think you guys should absolutely go see this movie in theatres as soon as you can it is awesome I definitely want to see it again and I will definitely be buying it on blu-ray to add to my collection because I need this movie in my life if you have seen Mad Max fury road already please let me know what you thought about it and we can talk about it in the comments below and let me know how do you think it compares to the original three Mad Max films I hope you guys enjoyed the review thank you
