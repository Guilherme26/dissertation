[Music] what's up guys I hope you're all fantastic out there I want to thank you as always for stopping by the channel if this is your first time here welcome to the silver screen analysis I hope you like what you hear and decide to stay we have a highly anticipated movie to review in this video that being the second directed film from Jordan Peele called us starring Lupita Nyong'o Winston Duke Evan Alex Shahadah right Joseph the story and this one follows a family that's on vacation that in defining themselves being terrorized by the demented doppelgangers now it certainly isn't easy to follow up a massive critical success in a directorial debut with another movie that accomplishes the same if not more feats than that one but I think that could be what Jordan Peele is sitting on with this movie because simply put I thought this movie was awesome it was creepy it was intelligent it was just twisted and loads of fun it was a perfect blend of horror and psychological thriller with dark comedy and together these elements just really fit nicely into one fluid narrative that took me on a very haunting ride with endless amounts of sinister appeal I think the plotline in concept is very grounded it isn't hard to put yourself in the position of this family to imagine what you would really do in their situation I thought it was just absolutely compelling to see how things unfolded the first act in particular the opening scene do a great job of setting the stage for this plotline it gives us this section of a flashback for this haunting night with this little girl it gives the viewer something to think about in the back of their mind as the tone then shifts to meeting the seemingly normal family the dynamics between them are all common to many other families their personalities were as well which I thought just made them very easy to connect with the dialogue was naturally charming with a great sense of humor it landed some solid laughs to keep me entertained and as things kind of built up but all the while you can just feel that something very dark and looming is foreboding in the backdrop of the story I thought it was very effective in creating subtle uneasiness and I was constantly on edge waiting for something dark to happen despite the atmosphere of the movie early on being kind of light and I enjoyed the contrast between both feelings it doesn't take long to learn enough about the characters to get a sense of they were and how their family dynamics were all structured then the story really does take a turn the mood drops into a much darker territory the atmosphere instantly switches to that of being very ominous as the family's tethered twins make their appearance and from that minute the tension really does shoot up and it doesn't waver for the rest of the runtime the scenes that progress from there where I thought equally as frightening as they were just steeped in a lot of just natural curiosity as to what was actually happening and I thought that is where Pele really shined with his writing and his direction by weaving a story that was just very haunting and eerie but at the same time thought-provoking and honestly fascinating it was unpredictable and it took some appealing terms during the progression it created some suspenseful home invasion sequences as well as some just pier flights for survival the character tropes are all at first kind of delivered and a seemingly routine package but I thought throughout this story their arcs were swapped up just enough to create some fun certain members of the family I relied on four things to keep them all alive and it was kind of a breath of fresh air to see some of the character tropes switched up a bit this added a ton of enjoyment to the already unique premise and it gave just the entire film a fresh vibe to it and I don't want to go into a lot of spoilers by speaking too much on the doppelgangers in this movie but I will say that the concept and then on paper was absolutely inventive they fit perfectly into the story to hit with pure frightening impact and it could not have been done without the excellent cast performances all the headlining actors had to play basically two versions of the roles that they took on and I thought each one of them knocked it out of the park with their performances I thought Lupita Nyong'o was amazing she captured both sides of her role to absolute perfection as this normal mother protecting her kids I thought she capably hit all the emotion and intensity needed to just root for her success and then as her dark and twisted twin she was even better with a haunting performance that I think is award worthy I think she made this movie she was eerie and unpredictable and just what this story needed to create just a great demented protagonist the easily the other bright spots in the cast were the performances of young Evan Alex and Shahadah right Joseph I thought these roles really required a lot of range from them and it was a pressive to see both of them pull off every needed angle of these characters I thought Jordan peels Direction was excellent it was an artistic it was ambitious I think he showed a very inspired eye behind the camera to really craft a fantastic horror film the production design and his methodical camerawork really blended together with a strong use of lighting in the movie and different angles to really build imposing scenes without the need for the usual jump scares I think in this movie the horror was in the writing just as much as it was in the visual appeal and together the result was a success it really plants the seeds for some ideas early on and then the final act it explores these concepts more to create just a world of thought I will be honest and say I think some of these layers could have been built a little sooner in the film but it was still well structured enough in the closing act to not feel rushed but it was very close despite that though I'm still gonna give us a solid 90 percent on the entertainment meter I had a great time during this movie it was very entertaining it was a blend of genres but the focus was always on the horror it was a movie that really did a good job of making you think about the big picture of the storylines actual setting the second act did linger just a little bit but it was very minor also some of the attempts at humor kind of just felt missed timed but I would have to say nothing to the extent of being distracting because I think everything else in this movie shined it was filled with natural characters that were able to really accomplish pulling off evil versions of themselves and with Jordan Peele riding and directing the tone of the story never lost its intention of just being subtly horrific and it accomplishes that thank you guys so much for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did give it a thumbs up share it with your friends don't forget to subscribe to the
