in black and white so it's very unique and refreshing to see in a movie,0.021949064
like this I feel like the in last movie that I saw in black and,0.029318634
white that was even up for awards consideration was Nebraska that was also really good,0.042876408
and I also enjoyed the fact that it wasn't just a series movie it was,0.01825929
a serious movie in a sense of certain issues that were being brought up but,0.028773183
it was also slightly comical so it wasn't just this long drawn-out movie where we're,0.026929295
like okay it's in black and white there's just so much going on that you,0.116220884
feel like you have to pay attention to it it's so detailed but it is,0.023787633
exactly what goes on that makes it so light-hearted and like I said going through,0.027806006
the motions especially a scene in the third act really just brought me to tears,0.029388478
and it just made me so emotional to watch you know the progression of the,0.026949916
character and what this movie was all really about in the end but unfortunately the,0.036608383
things that I didn't really like about this movie was that some parts of the,0.02443419
