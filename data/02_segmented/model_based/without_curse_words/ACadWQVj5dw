"What I can? Hey, what's going on out there, you two family"
"this is Samuel Leggett representing Team Jvs, To my great pleasure, I was able to go and attend the Middleburg Film Festival 2019"
"in Virginia, This had a slew of variously amazing films that have won awards all across from Tiff to Venice, to all around, And there was one film that was probably one of the first films that I saw @mf of 2019"
I really want to talk to you guys about
I'm talking about the Portrait of the Lady on fire
This film
"It was actually directed by Celine Saima, I apologize for pronunciation of the different names"
Claire Muffin was the cinematographer and the cast range from
I make sure I get all the cast and get all this out of the way
"Noemi Marlin, play the role of Maryann Adele had no play the role of Hey Louise, and they are the two stars of this film"
"Now this is the synopsis of the story on an isolated island on Bettany, at the end of the 18th century, a female painter is obligated to paint a wedding portrait of a young woman"
"Simple premise, right, but I was looking and I was like"
I see so many amazing different scores and reviews cinema scores
I think right now currently out of 93 rating
"so I was like, What is it about this story? What is it about this film that has elevated people's response like this? And I will tell you this is one of the best films I've seen all year"
This probably is one of the best foreign films I've seen in the past three years
"To be quite honest with you, Now break it down and tell you why"
"So breaking out from the cinematography what they were able to do with a lot of the shots, We're just mind melting because it opens up on the the ocean"
"You have Mary, and is going to the island, and kind of going with her painting materials and try to do everything she need to do, And the first thing that happens she has to go over for some unseen reason, but the camera never leaves the atmosphere"
"What I mean by that is Mary-louise again is an artist, and they take so much careful detail to the way she paints, the way she draws, the way that the characters interact"
They are very personal Istic
There's an amazing moment by a campfire that there's this Harmonist
"Ik, like noise is happening where people are singing"
people are dancing
"But the way that this actually shot is just so it pulls you in on so many different levels, but at the same time there's an elegance behind it because a big part of this film is the love story is the the essence of art and the beauty behind, like painting and drawing, and just the art form in general, and it goes from different ranges of that it can go from"
"At a certain point, there was a moment where Hey Louise and Mary, Andy are going at a piano and Mary"
Louise starts to play this interesting tune
And like you're just immersed into that
Now one of the biggest key points about this is the sound
The score
There is technically no rhythmic score throughout the film
"It's very silent film, but their attention to detail, whether it's the waves, whether it is the the paint Brussels hitting against the canvas, Whether it is like the interaction like the human touch, whether it's like this unseemly moment where it feels very uncomfortable and like you hear, like the scratching of like a chair or like something going on in the background or like at a campfire, you hear the popping of the, the wood or the materials or the the leaves"
This crackling
The sound design is perfect because it lays the atmosphere for everything that's actually happening
What other film kind of did something similar to that which was a lighthouse where their atmosphere was one of the biggest catalyst for the film
But there's there's technically not a real big score Throughout this
it's just the sound design is just perfect
Now let's go to the platform of the actual actresses and the people that were played in it fit with this
"so within this, of course, you have Adele Hansel, know me Marlin, with the main two leads, but you also have apologize, for"
I'm not even gonna try to name her her last name
But Luna plays a role of Sophie and Valeria Garli
"No, plays a role of Like Humpty's, Who is? Hey, Louise's mother"
"And really, that's it"
There is no other cast
There's really not any male characters that are primary leaves or secondary leads
"The only time you actually see male figures in this film are they're going and carrying luggage, or their, the background, or people are talking about what their connection is with this"
"now again, this is a very"
"This is a French film, English subtitles, But there was never a moment that I have missed the step"
There was never a moment
I felt like I had to pause because that was going to class
It's very paced
"very well, Matter of fact, I would say its pace perfectly because the the tension builds with the relationships that are had"
"because when Mary Louise, when not Mary Louise, when Mary Ann gets there like, she's kind of like put in the situation where like Okay, nobody's helping me to get here"
"I need to get where I need to go, but she's very independent"
"She's very, you know, passionate, and the actress that plays the role of Mary Ann is so perfect because she comes across very crass and yet passionate, and very artsy but yet standoffish, But then she like, consistently kind of drinks wine"
"Consistently, you know, smokes her pipe, and so you know, she's kind of like trying to think, trying to process, trying to get into her own headspace, but keeping people to a distance where the other side of that, the parallel to that is hey, Louise, who really just doesn't want her face to be painted"
"I'm not gonna say the reasons why, but she doesn't want to be painted"
"She kind of like wants to be on her own, and she's had tragedies before her life"
That's platformed her to the way in the direction she goes
"Now, then they are connected together and these actresses are so amazing because the thing about it is Yes, they can act"
There's in their scenes and the moments just by themselves
"They can act very well, but when they are together like it is some of the most amazing imagery of art and compassion and empathy and stress and worry and concern and empathy that are stretched through all different levels in the short amount of time in the gap of this film, and I was like there's so many different raw emotions that are so efficiently done that I was"
"I was captivated, I'm gonna be very honest"
I was very much so captivated
"And then they interact with the younger person who, Sophie, who kind of like you know, taking care of the place and kind of not undertake it, But she has her own store"
She has her own atmosphere
"That's going on, but there's never a moment where you feel like all this so dreary and so drought"
That's one of the things about favor up that
"Towards the the third half of the film I was kind of mean, Isn't the present Man Is is rough"
"There are moments of levity, not just comedy, but just like natural progression of characters, like they come to really come into their own, come into who they're meant to be, who they are to each other, and this, all different ranges of emotions that are effortlessly effortless effort"
Leslie done and displays through the screenplay
"Because the screenplay, I think plays the most part of it"
"I'm not sure how much of this was improv, but it felt like the script was just tight and I mean, I have to give credit where credit's due when it comes to the directing for this one because the movie knew exactly what it needed to be"
"It didn't try to reach, it didn't try to go super natural"
We didn't try to go too artsy
"It was the perfect blend of every one of those different dimensions of genre and again, Celine Saima, I give her a lot of credit because this right here to me should be, and would be, in my personal opinion, up for Best Picture nomination"
Not just best foreign film
I've not seen Parasite
I've heard great accolades about that
I've also not seen what was the other film was a farewell
"I haven't seen that, but this film right here to me could be a contender for best picked, and for me, I give this nothing less than a ten out of ten"
I know I didn't go too much into the story
"I think that the the mood and the movie in himself, it immerses you enough that you are gonna make this story in and out what you feel it's gonna be and what you feel behind it, and by the end of it you know I was in tears"
I was laughing
I was taking it back with every single moment and I think that the the the cast were amazing
"The sound design was excellent, the cinematography was immaculately beautiful, and the essence behind art form mix with camaraderie"
friendship
Love is the spread throughout this entire film and they just glistens perfectly
It is the perfect painting
I think that's the best way of kind of complementing this film
