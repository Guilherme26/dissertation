it's not good obviously tracer pressure her and hooking up and it's not good it's sad luckily he just doesn't hit the rape side,0.45493984
so that's good luckily she is home safely it's sad yeah and then she's trying to and then next day she's trying to impress her crush turns out he broke up with his last girlfriend because she didn't send news it's like but anyway and then so she's like she hints that she is dirty picture and that she doesn't send he's intrigued as a whole thing,0.24162196

it's nice she's making strides in the right direction,0.22004487

and you can see so I'm like because it's like a hopeful,0.085910775
ending but it's not ending,0.11159823
and I like those because the thing is and one way or together either my all-time favorite from Breakfast at Tiffany's has a crystal clear nice wrap,0.068073176
it up in a bow ending whereas other films like la-la-land,0.10545698
the ending is real and hits you,0.44490445
so I really like the ending of eighth grade,0.1445127
I think it's a really good movie,0.095792204
I think it's important to see um I think like a lot of people who like the romantic comedies in life or like the blockbusters will not like it's not a mainstream film not a lot of dialogue not la characters,0.13288844
it's very much in the mind of her,0.15320347
so if you like realistic films are are okay being inside the mind of thirteen-year-old girl then definitely it's great,0.22186553
but yeah so overall,0.07992988
I think 8th grades are good film I can definitely see it getting a word,0.05893666
but I don't see it winning though because I think a lot of things will beat it it's gonna be a heavy season between stars Boren and all the other good stuff so definitely but it creates a good film I highly recommend it,0.070942305
so go ahead and watch it,0.08690474
and now hopefully I will be posting the Broadway breakdown 13,0.1271936
