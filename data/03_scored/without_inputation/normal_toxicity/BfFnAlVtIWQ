hi guys,0.064576566
my name is Jimmy cage,0.09549836
and right,0.050612092
now the VN rd vienna international film festival is right on my doorstep and today i want to talk about a great movie called spotlight,0.18148059
the Boston priest molested kids in six different parishes over the last 30 years the church found out about it,0.44591543
and did nothing,0.07872683
we haven't committed any,0.07438525
long-term investigative resources to the case no we haven't and that's the kind of thing you're a team with you spotlight is the newest film of director Tom McCarthy whose last movie was the Magnificent cobbler,0.073184185
wait what yeah it's the same director and I don't know,0.099813014
what happened there,0.03492909
but maybe I don't really want to know,0.07694121
so let's just forget about that because spotlight is wonderfully classic filmmaking first you take a great story everybody's going to be interested in this obviously the church will fight us very hard in this case,0.14082061
that's the actual events of how the Boston Globe uncovered a massive scandal of child molestation and cover up within the local Catholic Archdiocese second transform it into a gripping and Leia baleia unfolding screenplay and then a third cast a bunch of great actors for all the lead roles,0.4390952
well these are only the basics but I built a strong foundation for the whole movie spotlight is very much in the vein of great biographical thrillers like All the President's Men it's done slow,0.24399033
and then keeps on building tension drama revelations and also satisfaction,0.10583955
that's what these stories are born,0.039857473
you're going to give me the names and the names of their victims are you threatening me,0.34935987
I was doing my job,0.08114467
yeah you never more nose suspense mystery and also a lot of hard work,0.26743352
I think that's the main reason why I'm really into stuff like this the people involved the journalists of the Boston Globe laughed their jobs and it's great to see what they can accomplish when working together,0.06626629
it's a well-crafted story with of course a groundbreaking Pulitzer prize-winning source material and it's so important to tell it because now roughly 10 years later those molestation scandals are still around and they keep coming the movie shows how important investigative journalism is but also more in general their victims should never be silenced and that even big institutions like the church must be challenged and fought when doing wrong that said let's talk about the performances I'm herself was totally surprised by Mark Ruffalo,0.26546025
I was aware that Michael Keaton did a fantastic job as head of the spotlight team at the boston globe but i had no idea what is strange,0.10630546
but powerful performance Ruffalo would deliver he portrays,0.093010545
Michael resendiz who was the lead writer and lead reporter of the opening story about the scandals Ruffalo plays him as an eccentric but also very lovable character who absolutely lives for his field of work from the spotlight team,0.09908183
he is the most fleshed out character as mentioned before Keaton is also great and yet another surprise for me liev schreiber by the way a great name for his role as editor of The Boston Globe because shabba means writer in Germany the whole cast forms a greater Samba and it's nice to see that the people involved are not written as superheroes but they too have flaws and are only human they also very few moments that feel sensational in any way most of the time the facts and a true story speak for themselves,0.15448155
I am here,0.06623651
because I care we're going to tell this story,0.051202748
we're going to tell it right,0.0654336
spotlight takes the audience and a real-life subject seriously and I think it's a great movie are you on the same page or other things,0.09660103
you didn't like that much,0.15383232
please tell me in the comments below and my next movie review from the via nada will be a pretty strange,0.1336159
one the lobster,0.074905716
