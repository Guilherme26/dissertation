so I saw the Dunkirk movie this review I guess of this movie there's going,0.04172963
to be a lot of spoilers my friend there will be a lot the reason,0.04828834
I'm reviewing this I didn't expect to do this video at all the reason I'm,0.07106423
reviewing this is because this is my all-time favorite movie I was freaking shook us,0.19970809
to the core to the freaking core of the earth and myself shook by this,0.35015458
movie so uh the whole world seems to know that Harry Styles first movie is,0.018722923
Dunkirk so early on like last spring blast some time where I wasn't in school,0.042291045
that's all I remember I looked up Harry Styles while he was on his break,0.021702282
and I'm like oh interesting he's going to be in a movie not just like,0.05853217
I'm gonna see that movie you know when you're a directioner or you just like,0.078493
Harry Styles or any of the members you just kind of want to like support,0.027428182
them and whatever they do hence the movie like a bunch of Directioners are going,0.10888923
to see the movie because you know it's like your baby you know yeah baby,0.2618398
kind of growing up and becoming his own oh man he's not even a baby,0.14675348
he older than me my friend I know it don't look like it but he,0.0528076
is and he's living his life and his see he's succeeding he's freaking finessing everything,0.32845643
so naturally I didn't know what the movie was there was no trailer there was,0.01937414
nothing much about it it was just like he's in a movie no I'm going,0.10846618
to see that so time passes and then I found out the movies called Dunkirk,0.04804023
I'm like oh great I'm going to buy tickets when it comes out didn't think,0.04974842
much about it was like supporting my man Harry Harold Edward Stiles that one and,0.04620698
so originally I was brought to it because of Harry I'm not going to lie,0.05465681
to you a few more like a little more time passed and I actually saw,0.03676204
the trailer yeah yeah I thought it wasn't even playing on it kind of hit,0.20654817
me by surprise those in the movie theater with my friends and it just is,0.032522824
like Dunkirk burnt you know like the trailer just did the trailer it just did,0.17762332
its thing and I was like oh god this is the one with Harry in,0.030991571
it too right uh-huh mm-hmm so we go this is going to hurt me more,0.19547951
in my feelings and I was a besting it too so it did basically more,0.03577624
came out more interviews more trailer time everything kind of it just became more and,0.06963541
it kind of built up and yes but mmm my god thing with war movies,0.18025745
is I personally they're probably one of my favorite movies and I'm like I suck,0.4380812
at history but I really like more movies for some reason the reason I don't,0.026182959
watch it that much it's because Tyra my bunny is on the floor if you,0.11043712
can hear that I apologize okay buzzing with me and more movies is that I,0.07419192
usually don't watch them just because they're kind of like emotionally kind of like okay,0.16905908
like why did we have war and I kind of get mad at the fact,0.13958946
that there's so much hate that we had to like fight with other countries like,0.10066357
there's so much bad stuff that we had to fight with each other so I,0.092461854
get really like saddened kind of by war movies so I just don't watch that,0.092843674
many but they're like my favorite type of movies which is weird I found out,0.03620262
that Christopher Nolan directed it honestly I haven't watched any movies from Christopher Nolan because,0.029494243
I have this gap of like not washing movies in my life and I don't,0.09295742
know why I haven't watched any of his previous movies as far as I know,0.030906428
that's going to change okay so I was sitting there was my friend and my,0.06920571
mom and my friend sister and we were watching the movie it starts right lights,0.051348187
went down movie begin oh my god it just started as already action like we,0.03563189
went straight into it they had the main character I don't think any of them,0.123524606
have names except for one or I wasn't paying attention if they actually did have,0.023632644
names but the main character we just starts off and he goes and he's in,0.021480776
with a group of people and then straight off the bat like they're just getting,0.38976562
shot they did they gone for the rest of the movie that's why I five,0.3132848
people got paid their five dollars and now they're good and they just great and,0.0402629
they're dying that was over so you already start with like boom action you're intrigued,0.07019351
he got your attention he Christopher Nolan yes he knows what he's doing he was,0.038351163
and some at territory I'm assuming that's why he was getting shot at him and,0.15580264
his group and he was like the only survivor he went with the French although,0.017863506
you know English and French allies they don't like each other so they were like,0.18430908
okay come here and go somewhere else like bye so he just went and he,0.07350945
found his other English people on the beach and they were all trying to get,0.19133875
out of Dunkirk on the way he was about to take a dump very good,0.22626087
touch on the movie because you just don't expect to see that in a movie,0.039950263
great um and well he didn't written same thing by the way and there was,0.025633518
a guy burying a body and he switched coats so he had the English coat,0.16518107
on but he wasn't English from England but we don't know at this point where,0.0704496
he's from um then the story continues they're trying to get out and basically Germany,0.037791744
just keeps like sudden bombs and killing a lot of people so they would just,0.617781
have to go back on shore and just try to survive but they would send,0.02171359
more boats try to survive spend more boats try to survive and we have like,0.016789235
these three point of views right a little boat like a little vacation boat one,0.06510285
they just say on the sea usually was going out to Dunkirk so they can,0.027396254
bring some people back to England the second one was a pilot also going to,0.09651682
protect them from all all these planes that kept on shooting their ships so they,0.15182151
were sending the airport and so we had one of the characters it was three,0.01432473
planes they were going out there and then they had the other point of view,0.040004145
which is the one we started with is where they're already in Dunkirk and trying,0.027042376
to escape so they have a few scenes in the movie I'm not going to,0.029828165
like tell the whole story because you need to see the movie there's just like,0.021416917
a few scenes that really stuck out to me one was when they were like,0.03686514
really losing hope they just had a random guy we didn't know him or anything,0.044815417
he just went into the water and he just jumped in and drowned themselves like,0.2839978
he literally gave up hope and not only him but everybody they had the scene,0.17002493
where they had the boat coming out and it was leaving the port they were,0.031407975
leaving they had their bread they were kind of just like okay we just go,0.105661094
back to England and do whatever they need to do and they had I think,0.1832102
a torpedo that just hit a ship and there we go and the ship was,0.07377818
gone and in the room they were in it was like locked because that's just,0.06759463
how they were at the time and the guy that we didn't know that who's,0.035727013
not English was out while all the English soldiers are in there and he was,0.06829041
out just kind of like thinking about what he was doing and I think he,0.045865744
was just contemplating a lot of things and so he was outside of the ship,0.022777218
and they got hit and everybody was stuck in that room the ship starts like,0.054157257
tilting and they had water coming in and literally they were just drowning in this,0.25392348
room and so many were trying to unlock it but they were already like this,0.02191115
it was almost impossible and then the guy we don't know where he's from yet,0.035245422
opens it and then they all like come falling out and they go back to,0.050005846
shore and that it was such a freaking emotional like I can't describe it how,0.29440573
good of a seeing this was it was such an emotional scene and you just,0.053973
felt it and you saw all these characters and everything oh like if my god,0.063074045
just saw like how helpless is basting then like they kept trying and then but,0.023510916
it just like stopped like I was brought to tears I'm almost crying four times,0.030815963
in this movie I don't want to tell I've never done like a movie review,0.033635013
I don't want to tell too much as a story it's just like it's such,0.036773346
a good story something I wanted to mention what they had since the very like,0.018429577
first scene this ticking it was ticking and ticking and ticking very subtle in the,0.02251048
background but it was happening the whole time that was telling you that just time,0.014979935
kept passing and rushing everything like everything needed to be done and it's just not,0.023342624
being done it's kind of like the ticking feel of what like what I was,0.02176481
feeling around the end of the movie they had actual like ships that came by,0.034954734
and they were back in England they were on the train and while he's boarding,0.120096244
the Train Harry's character Alex a butthole by the way there's um you'll see why,0.38931632
when you see the movie like you just you you're not meant to like his,0.14253223
character he's real tough and like you know you're just not supposed to like him,0.032650538
oh my god by Harry's acting it like this being his first movie it's just,0.030522617
weird tonight like usually don't notice when you see like a pop star going some,0.035165597
so this was like a whole different thing for me but like where did you,0.07537063
learn how to act there was a scene where I was just like so surprised,0.060216416
and this whole movie like I know I originally heard of it because of Harry,0.03365031
but I forgot Harry was in it like it was such a beautifully made movie,0.024897158
all the angles all the things in like the color grading was so great and,0.04264492
like beautiful and it just fits so well and you just felt every single character,0.043009445
and you felt every death and there were so many deaths and you just felt,0.37630895
all of it and how like you just felt the hope leaving and they had,0.042783283
something like panic scenes and like just you you're like stomach went into a not,0.09479665
like you didn't know how to feel and all you can do should sit there,0.029892022
and watch the movie and I think Christopher Nolan he's just a genius in the,0.061192904
way that he made this movie like I don't know how his brain even thought,0.24413279
of this like how did he make such a great movie I don't freaking have,0.12922522
a clue anyways they were brought back to England and s and they were getting,0.061915293
there's a guy handing out towels and he was looking down the whole time it,0.045576386
was ticking and was ticking his ticking everything it was like a very subtle tick,0.04728857
they had the main characters like the nice guy the guy you like and then,0.061695784
they had Alex so Alex was the first one walking into the train and the,0.024309801
guy was looking down and he was he said congrats and then Alex looked back,0.047004536
and he was like for what we only survived or something like that and it,0.04182076
was like that's enough and then I was just kept walking in the train and,0.030557206
then the main character he got his towel and then the guy was looking down,0.029220853
who's handing the towels and said that that's good that you like survived felt his,0.023280762
face meaning he was blind and then after when they were in the Train I've,0.022986086
said that dumb guy couldn't even look me in the eye to say congrats or,0.43551034
whatever and he was just you know like they need completely like two different things,0.029546127
and that's when the ticking stopped like as soon as he said that and that,0.026523532
like I don't know like I feel like I should know what that means but,0.023772998
I don't and this whole movie just kept me freakin alive guys I don't know,0.3375946
