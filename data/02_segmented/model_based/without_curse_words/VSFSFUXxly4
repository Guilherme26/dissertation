"Hey, guys, welcome back to my channel"
This is Charlene
I haven't record a movie review video for such a long time today
I am going to do a review on Lady Bird
"Yes, I watched this movie this afternoon"
It is a great movie telling about how middle class family are going through
It has been a while since a movie had moved me emotionally
I cried In the ending
It is a really great movie for any family or any one who had gone through high school and gone through conflicts with family
I won't tell about flaws today
I just wanted to share you guys how this movie is
"I really liked the pace of this movie, and also the tone"
"the color Hm, cause Ladybird has pink hair, they used a lot of blue and pink colors inside the movie"
Also a lot of sceneries landscapes that I really love through out this movie
I think everything is based on a simple script
"The family are a middle class family and they are through day by day financial stresses, and Lady Bird in high school is through searching for love and you know, meeting the wrong person and noticed that her lover is gay and everything in the story is simple"
"All the transitions in the story is really simple, but in a fact it feels so true and so realistic that I feel I was in their world"
The soundtrack is comforting
"It has a really great ending, So this movie I really do recommend"
this movie is telling us to be grateful and to have a gratitude of life
I think the movie kind of taught me to just be who I am right now and know that love is always there for me
"I think you guys will like it, So thank you for clicking on this video and just remember to subscribe and I'll be posting every week"
