the black clansmen hi my name is Kyle Suggs and welcome to my channel and,0.06624032
I'm going to give you my conservative take and we're going to start right now,0.0331175
so the way this works is I'm gonna give you my movie review based on,0.069221005
five categories and of those five categories and we're gonna score it and I'm giving,0.020218257
you a four star rating after that I'm gonna give you a conservative take on,0.024530642
whether or not you should go not go or to go with caution now mind,0.056059018
you this section will include spoilers but I will indicate that above and you can,0.03596049
skip over that if you like to do that go into the description and look,0.03207449
for the index and you can skip forward to anywhere in the video okay so,0.04617239
now with that let's get started so the black clansmen is Spike Lee his latest,0.25910234
movie it came out in 2018 it stars John David Washington as Ron star worth,0.023135751
as well as Adam driver and it's a based on a true story about an,0.016881695
infiltration of the police into the Ku Klux Klan and it's interesting because Ron star,0.3254033
Werth happens to be black and so this story is pretty interesting because obviously it's,0.21280289
very difficult for a black person to join the Klan and so Adam driver is,0.39978185
a person who actually helps with this sting operation and so as far as the,0.02714814
story is concerned it's a pretty decent story it goes forward with Ron stallworth goes,0.019535778
to college campus he meets a woman that he falls in love with and ends,0.13590167
up finding out that there is a gentleman there who's the political person and they're,0.036956273
worried about potential Black Panther uprisings and so he's supposed to be spying on that,0.13093807
but to find out he actually decides to let's do this and infiltrate the Ku,0.037722565
Klux Klan so he gains permission to do that and then escapades ensue so as,0.13911784
far as the story is concerned it's pretty cut and dry but since it's a,0.023329986
true story I'll give this rating a 7 as far as the emotional impact in,0.01510233
this movie I don't feel much I mean I'm a black man and I still,0.37799817
didn't really get any movement in my emotions one way or the other out of,0.030540576
sort of what blase I was expecting something a little bit more powerful but it,0.106975496
was trying to be a comedy and then trying to get serious so it really,0.03339754
didn't have any impact because I didn't really know what it wanted to do in,0.018844653
terms of its tone and so yeah I give it a 5 as far as,0.025158577
the intangibles for this movie again this movie doesn't have much it doesn't jump out,0.03237981
at you the direction is anything spectacular it's it's okay there's the acting is okay,0.1063775
I guess the screenplay is so so again the mood of the film is all,0.015025168
over the place you don't know this wants to be a comedy if it wants,0.099837415
to be serious what is it I think Spike Lee just kind of phoned this,0.03251351
one in and he expected this to actually be you know an oscar-worthy movie so,0.04666596
for the intangibles I'm getting a 5 as far as watch ability I give it,0.04689744
a 4 because I don't really want to see it again and I don't want,0.032173604
to recommend it the last few minutes just destroys the movie it's too much on,0.09730905
the nose and that's nothing about this film he does stuff that's way over the,0.094527915
top and it's like the messaging is just in your face punch you with no,0.6902713
subtlety whatsoever it's a clear propaganda piece and I don't want to see it again,0.089096025
and I don't want to recommend it my overall rating for this film it's going,0.08162668
to be a 6 and that's highly generous because I mean I guess there is,0.011276858
some decent acting in here and it is fairly well put together but the story,0.02459849
isn't really good the soundtrack or the score really isn't that memorable the climax in,0.017067282
it into the film is a misnomer it's poorly directed by the way this is,0.025911564
a spoiler section not that you they care anyway but just so you know so,0.031134585
Spike Lee at the end of the movie does a three or four minute montage,0.021565253
on the Charlottesville incident where he takes the president out of contact saying that there,0.015786804
are good people on on all sides the actual quote I'll put up on the,0.020852176
screen is not what he said in the context and if you look at the,0.016970165
actual situation there Charles Vil it's a lot differently what the media was portraying it,0.017225595
and if that's all he has to lay on the president's feet in terms of,0.06092018
being racist well I mean that's pretty that's pretty weak and he tries to draw,0.36379462
loose comparisons to America first about the plan using that slogan and he's obviously taking,0.055282082
a dig at Americans and that's also very weak considering the fact that Spike Lee,0.08614927
wants to essentially say that he's for illegal aliens over Americans that's that's the messaging,0.26606646
the America first it's put legal Americans first over illegal aliens and here you have,0.23642516
a guy who talks about the bondage of the African people of African despo yet,0.6284536
he wants to put the people that struggled hard for over a hundred years where,0.04723469
they actually were whipped beaten lynched he's gonna put these people in the descendants of,0.646674
these people in the back of the bus for illegal aliens which is essentially what,0.29260677
you're saying I think now is a good time to mention to spike that every,0.082937755
person every races that was depicted in this movie by an actor was a Democrat,0.10647262
that includes George Wallace that includes President Woodrow Wilson and yes even includes your main,0.035568036
antagonist David Duke at a time of this occurrence in history David Duke was a,0.058266763
Democrat and though some of you may be saying hey but the party switched and,0.032994438
so forth well that's not true it's very easily debunked I will leave a link,0.0284519
below of a video that I did that's very well documented called the three ways,0.080668814
to prove that the parties never switched so check that out and also his messaging,0.040579528
he comes out and says you know what he says well once you go out,0.035307284
and get a gun he has Stokely Carmichael who was presented in the movie who,0.1771617
basically whisper in the lead actresses ear saying go get a gun and arm yourself,0.60552543
delete a character stallworth and the female lead here knock on the door they go,0.051022246
grab their guns and go out Blake blazing but they go out of the sea,0.36613414
what's outside and of course it's a cross burning in the backyard and it goes,0.1856042
into this montage it makes no sense whatsoever but at the same time he wants,0.07777993
to have the socialist liberal mentality in terms of an victimization of Africans but he,0.20529962
wasn't turn around and say go and get a gun so that's totally hypocritical in,0.19533117
terms of the messaging front coming from the left so I don't know what Specter,0.040958017
he's trying to do and then he wants at the full on the Oscars and,0.019652186
put down the green book as if his movie is so much better well spike,0.123974934
your movie was not that much better in fact it was horrible in comparison no,0.07191234
one's claiming that spike always want to have an Oscar to his name for Best,0.016783249
Picture he got Best Screenplay he shared it with three others and by the way,0.024891172
he was only person to actually speak during that ceremony so spike in there what,0.046529595
man you really dropped the ball on this one and you really showed yourself on,0.170291
this and no no one needs to go see this film the little bit that,0.0977341
it was good you've ruined it towards the end with that out of context montage,0.10686907
racist crap that she put out there trying to portray people in a light that,0.7841199
they weren't supposed to be so that's my rant and I'm done with that so,0.022320237
my final take on this movie is basically it's a rating of 11 out of,0.08494195
score of 20 it's a two and a half star movie there's some few things,0.031142568
in there that keep it from being a total piece of crap but two and,0.67735505
a half stars definitely dunkels see this and so with that I'm done and if,0.04254182
