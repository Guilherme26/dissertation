bo,
burnham has a really great way of crafting a story of 8th graders you know we're all kind of weird at that age,0.35779968
you know 13 14 years old and we're quirky and we're into weird things and we have a weird sense of humor and he really portrays that I guess in this film he where they shot the movie in the school these were actually eighth graders there's a lot of great performances,0.15493779
in this film kayla has a crush on this one guy this main guy that we've seen in many coming-of-age films we've seen this in a lot of films a lot of John Hughes films,0.13847634
you know like the nerdy characters has the hatch for the the really rebellious or the popular boy and that's true in this movie as well she's really into this guy,0.30138904
and they cut to this this kid and all you see is his eyes his dreamy eyes and like his shirt off and things like that,0.35155052
and it has like cool,0.05293321
synth Wave music in this movie they cut to in different acts of the movie and it's really really great and with Kayla,0.07693004
she has a YouTube channel each day she kind of does a little V log or you know talking about you know building confidence coming to terms with who she is and like trying to build confidence and go out there and meet people and make friends and and really just become a better person and being an introvert,0.122883424
she does have a great personality,0.10441921
she just doesn't know how to display that with her you know schoolmates and you know she's thrown into the situation she has to go to this popular girls pool party and she really doesn't want to be there because they're popular and she's kind of the nerd and quiet one but she's thrown into that and you can see how really terrible kids are today in this movie especially because they're so wrapped up in social media they're staring at their phones all day long they're in school they're at a party,0.41684002
they're not even like interacting with one another just staring at their phones like zombies you know looking at Instagram and snapchat and stupid filters,0.80089366
they haven't snapchat but she's thrown in this situation that's really out of her comfort zone,0.20065701
and she does the best that she can really do to fit in and try to make some friends,0.11218479
and there's a boy there that she becomes friends with you know,0.24081866
he's kind of a weird kid as well it kind of hit it off and become friends,0.56008184
but the rest of the popular kids kind of look down I'm Kayla as being that big geek and personally they don't want to be friends with so coming up to the end of the eighth-grade year they have to go to high school - shadow high schoolers to see what they're gonna be coming across next year and how everyone is in high,0.2409399
school you know different personalities and different groups and things like that Kayla becomes friends with the high schooler and she kind of shows her to the ropes of that,0.12684458
school and they actually don't hang out at a local,0.09862654
mall I guess that's still popular to go to the,0.06502695
mall I thought models were kind of absolutely these,0.10513078
days Kailas introduced to these older high schoolers and hang out at the small and she's really seeing how these older kids interact with one another and their sense of humor and things they like it really opens up to this really nerve-wracking scene in the movie that really kept me on the edge of my seat with Kayla and this older high school boy and him trying to make a move on her and and realizing that this is pretty up,0.09120251
and you didn't know what's gonna happen,0.112852216
so I don't want to ruin any of that,0.24010053
but that's one particular scene in the movie that really kept you on the edge of your seat with that being said Bo Burnham has crafted a really really great story here probably one of the more original films of 2018,0.06529614
you know we're wrapped up in superhero movies and horror and things like that you know this is more like a modern take on like a John Hughes film,0.22181839
you know like a pretty in pink sixteen Candles and seeing where kids are today,0.151275
and how they're wrapped up in technology and social media,0.050143708
and you know that they can't communicate,0.09722578
with one another in person and they can't go hang out,0.2292541
they're always on their phones and it's really kind of sad to see that you know with me being in eighth grade,0.1306233
we didn't really have cell phones and a common theme here is how kids today are just using social media and really not forming real relationships everything's over the internet,0.08368391
and I think that's kind of what Bo Burnham was going at with this story,0.07386026
you know kids having snapchat accounts it like 5th grade and things like that's absurd and hopefully,0.4434948
my son will not be using the cell phone at that age until he's you know in high school and there's a lot of great themes and stories here of great performances by l-c Fisher playing Kayla she was obviously the standout performance and really seeing her life from the beginning to the end going into high school and everything she comes across and building confidence and trying to make friends and you know just be herself and be a good person,0.054916263
and I really appreciated that she did an excellent job,0.0918219
in this film,0.10722094
I want to give it up to Bo Burnham for writing and directing this film he directed the big sick which was another great film that came out a few years ago and really looking forward to his future work and other stories,0.17577763
