with the release of the new movie adaptation of rebecca starring lily james and army hammer i thought it was high time that i rewatched the alfred hitchcock directed adaptation from 1940 starring laurence olivier and joan fontaine i'd watched it when i was 17 so it's like eight years ago so to re-watch it as an adult was an interesting experience let's get to [Music] it [Music] hey everyone i am cassidy krieger i am an actor writer and the founder of hollywoodland photos right here and over on instagram my aim is to share the passion and love i have for old hollywood films and stars by doing movie reviews talking about the lives and scandals of the stars i release videos every week so make sure you hit the subscribe button and give me a follow over on instagram the 1940 movie rebecca is based on the 1937 book of the same name by daphne du maurier now i've googled how to pronounce that i apologize if it's wrong the author drew on inspiration from her own life and feelings of jealousy towards her new husband's ex-fiancee now rebecca is about a young woman who marries an aristocratic and diversely handsome widower maxim de winter he takes her back to his grand mansion manderly where we meet the cold and calculating mrs danvers who is played brilliantly by the australian actor act actress actress judith anderson the ghost of maxim's first wife the glamorous and beautiful rebecca haunts the newlyweds and the new mrs dewinter believes she pales in comparison to the first my suggestion didn't seem to go at all well sorry oh but you don't understand it's that i well i'm not the sort of person men marry i don't know what you mean i don't belong in your sort of world for one thing well what is my sort of word well mandolin you know what i mean rebecca was alfred hitchcock's first hollywood film after many years of success back in his home of the uk it was produced by david o selznick who was fresh off and riding high from the success of gone with the wind which was released the year before now speaking of gone with the wind vivian lee who was newly married to lawrence olivier was determined to play the role of the second mrs dewinter mainly so she could act opposite lawrence olivier now the director and the producers weren't so convinced she was right for the role not because she's not a great actress i mean she just won the best actor award at actress award academy awards but they believed that her personality was too strong for the meek and mild and sister winter so luckily for us though the audition tape with laurent olivier still exists we don't know sir because danvers is very distressed about it find out who broke it and make them be more careful in the future yes samus why do they come to me with these things that's your job darling i i meant to tell you but i didn't i broke the cupid myself i'm awfully sorry it was terribly careless on me you did well why didn't you say something about it when fritz was here i started too but somehow i didn't get a job it doesn't matter we'll have to explain to mrs danvers that's what i've got oh no no please max and will you tell her and let me go upstairs in charlotte chandler's book it's only a movie which was a biography dedicated to alfred hitchcock olivier is quoted as saying when they called to say someone named joan fontaine had been given the role opposite me i can't say i was thrilled i'd certainly never heard of her when i met her what i noticed was how young and skinny she was i didn't really understand what my character maxim dewinter could see in her as i understood max better i decided that she was just what he wanted someone exactly the opposite of rebecca he had enough of rebecca he was looking for docile even wilted at david o'sale's next insistence and still quite rare in hollywood today the movie faithfully adapts the plot of the book there are a few minor or quite major plot differences that had to kind of be enforced because because of the hollywood production code which was in place at the time mainly now this is a spoiler if you haven't seen the movie you read the book stop watching but in the book maxim does shoot and kill rebecca but according to the code the killing of a spouse had to be punished which in the book and film it is not so her death is declared a suicide and it's kept that way interestingly there are undertones and hints to a romantic relationship between rebecca and mrs danvers which of course thanks to the code could not be fully explored but hitchcock in his genius way found a way to subtly hint at it when mrs danvers is showing the new mrs de winter rebecca's negligee he proves that just the thought and the implication of nudity can be just as powerful as nudity itself did you ever see anything so delicate [Music] look you can see my hand [Music] rebecca was released in april 1940 to critical and commercial acclaim the new york times called it an altogether brilliant film haunting suspenseful handsome and handsomely played it was nominated for 11 academy awards and won two including one for best picture which was alfred hitchcock's only best picture academy award i am such a massive lawrence olivier fan that's painfully obvious to anybody that knows me uh so anything with so larry involved i'm guaranteed to love but there was something special about rebecca i am yeah i i can see it becoming one of my favorite films it was different watching it now as opposed to when i was 17 watching as an adult with a lot more respect for the craft and filmmaking and um and more life experience i guess i just i really i really enjoyed it um but the standout for me was joan fontaine her beauty and talent was perfectly captured by alfred hitchcock that in times it literally took my breath the way i had to kind of sit back and go whoa that was something else i can see why it won best picture it truly deserved it this film rightfully so made joan fontana star and the following year she won the academy award for best actress for another hitchcock directed film suspicion which is another film i've yet to see so i must watch it i'm shocked and angry that i hadn't seen it um i get to read the book so i would love to know if you've read it what your thoughts are in comparison to the movie and if you've seen the new film it's not out in australia yet i cannot wait to see it and compare the two i'm such a massive lily james fan so i can't see what she does with the role let me know your thoughts in the comments or send me a dm i'm always open to chat about films it's my favorite thing to do don't forget to hit the subscribe button give me a follow on instagram and i will see you again very soon
