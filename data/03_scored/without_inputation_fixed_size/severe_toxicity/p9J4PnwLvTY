Oh could I ask you to love Rebecca step whenever you touched me I knew,0.088178076
hi guys thank you for joining me again um we are talking about Rebecca today,0.03871635
from 1940 so normally on this channel I share things with you that I am,0.045355547
watching for the first time because there's so many there's just so many classic films,0.06711503
and I've seen quite a lot of them but there's always ones I haven't seen,0.023840182
and I always like to expand my viewing you know but this time I'm sharing,0.033998866
Rebecca with you because a friend of mine said she's like why don't you talk,0.086944826
about Rebecca and I was like the only reason I I haven't is just because,0.034724582
normally I share things I haven't watched and Rebecca is one of my favorite classic,0.031822387
films and yeah I guess I should share some of those with you guys as,0.05799337
well right so this is a Hitchcock film was actually Hitchcock's sort of first Hollywood,0.05252689
film and it was the only Hitchcock film to ever win an Oscar so that,0.047679033
makes it a little bit special in itself it is a psychological thriller and it,0.13173962
is based on the book called Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier Hitchcock adapted other of,0.028352123
her books some of some others of her books as well if you've never read,0.13096069
a Daphne du Maurier book highly recommend it she's such a good writer she creates,0.076255985
atmosphere and her books are kind of not really supernatural sometimes there's an element like,0.050156176
a ghostly sort of element or mood like a gothic mood Rebecca definitely has kind,0.029801557
of a gothic vibe but um she just has this way of kind of making,0.05182246
this atmosphere and this creeping strangeness and mystery and you just want to know what's,0.076877266
really going on and who did what and what's really happening so if you've not,0.02484461
read one of her books before I recommend Rebecca hustling because it's a bit of,0.07913557
a favorite of mine this film Rebecca is actually very similar to the book which,0.022324229
is nice I think Hollywood films of this era or maybe just films in general,0.03248158
sometimes they stick to the book and sometimes they really don't and you know either,0.028044142
can be good without apt ations but I think in this case sticking sticking to,0.03535052
this plot was a good thing so stars Joan Fontaine and she actually isn't named,0.04636729
so we will call her mrs. to winter if you don't know Joan Fontaine I,0.091373615
do talk about her in some other movies they talked about she was in suspicion,0.037558265
which is another Hitchcock one as well Laurence Olivier plays Maxim Laurence Olivier is a,0.035845418
was a really Laurence Olivier it was an institution basically so he's known for his,0.022579659
version of Hamlet so Joan Fontaine plays I think she's about 23 24 she's very,0.05584283
young and she gets she goes to Monte Carlo working as a companion so she's,0.027023086
somebody who's quite naive has been quite sheltered and she's trying to work for a,0.06790195
living in a respectable way so she's very socially naive and young and she gets,0.12892456
swept off her feet by Maxim de Winter who played by Laurence Olivier as I,0.26251718
said he's dashing handsome sort of mysterious he has this past where his wife died,0.16201478
tragically and everyone talks about how he never got over it and his wife Rebecca,0.09812058
is like supposed to be just the most beautiful woman and but they fall for,0.061332595
each other and his nicer kind of side comes out and she agrees to marry,0.036558494
him and it's all very cute but then they get home to his house called,0.048319604
Mandalay which is like a huge mansion that's been in his family for generations and,0.035204843
it's it's such a core part of the film and it's also part of his,0.021468801
identity because it's his ancestral home and it means just means so much to him,0.053076997
but you get the impression that Rebecca's just everywhere in this house so the new,0.019800521
mrs. Dewinter feels like he can't forget his ex-wife and she sort of almost wants,0.045140028
the film but not physically and this is kind of exacerbated by mrs. Danvers who,0.044834707
is the housekeeper but she was personal maid to to Rebecca she's played by Judith,0.042434726
Anderson so 10 commandments Laura she has such a great face for this role because,0.031668726
she sort of she has like a severe kind of nose and she's not plain,0.30398175
but she's not um she's sort of not sparkling or lively and you can kind,0.094163395
of see why she would be she's a mean spirited person and you can see,0.2794573
why she would have been drawn to Rebecca as somebody kind of who was everything,0.11284042
she couldn't be you know like wealthy beautiful admired all of these things so mrs,0.16985132
danvers is pretty horrible to the new mrs. Dewinter she kind of she's never directly,0.20761712
rude but she just does little things like Oh Rebecca would have done it this,0.0983208
way Rebecca would have done it that way or the previous mrs. de winter always,0.038805485
did this and the jerem Fontaine's garde to basically just can't kind of catch a,0.045932926
break and it starts to make her more and more sort of retreating into her,0.060183156
shell and she can't quite reach out to maxim he just has his own personal,0.08398077
demons and doesn't really understand the position that she's in because he's never been in,0.17405993
that position himself so that's kind of the core thing is Rebekah haunting them but,0.048322264
it sort of comes to light that there's more to Rebecca's death than kind of,0.08324574
meets the eye so I don't want to tell you too much about that but,0.05049542
that's kind of a cool thing I absolutely love Durham Fontaine in this movie she's,0.08850601
kind of she's got an inner toughness but she's just so unsure about herself socially,0.07502141
because she's so young she doesn't come from money she's never had to you know,0.08488608
run a household and that's the kind of thing that people are raised to do,0.041839387
and she also she's very pretty but she's not like a bombshell or anything you,0.2241648
know she's not used to people looking to her for answers and that kind of,0.06895294
thing so she doesn't know how to take control of a situation and that's handled,0.05425171
really well in this film because could just easily be like a OneNote character but,0.016062854
in de Moraes book you really understand how she's looking for guidance and people are,0.05857208
kind of taking advantage of that I'm giving her incorrect information and that kind of,0.069554925
thing so she's kind of she's beautiful her character is very dramatic but she also,0.084767014
has this vulnerability that's just really nicely done so yeah I think she's so good,0.07964776
in this film and also Laurence Olivier's maxim is really great because he's very commanding,0.06532303
he's very dashing but he has that British reserve that can come across as coldness,0.06964938
and it also kind of hides a temper and a kind of passionate nature as,0.028910877
well she's kind of his perfect romantic but maybe kind of doc character um so,0.03894916
Hitchcock when he made films he would always storyboard a lot so that's like almost,0.053438857
like drawing the book is a cartoon it was a comic strip beforehand so he,0.18604521
would really only shoot what he wanted and they kind of call that style of,0.4631308
editing in camera it's where you you don't take any extra footage for sort of,0.06565096
just in case you just shoot you know exactly what you want so you just,0.6179574
shoot that and it has kind of made him very popular I think because it,0.4411464
meant he was always sort of on-time and on-budget and organized and he didn't mess,0.03095166
around which Studios really appreciate because it keeps things keep things moving and they're not,0.040118556
wasting money but it also means that you can't do any sort of edits because,0.04424735
there's no extra footage to kind of throw something else in there so it's a,0.0916796
kind of way for the director to kind of keep control Selznick who had been,0.037876222
walking on gone with the wind around this time and as a producer he definitely,0.03472791
had more of a hand in this film than Hitchcock would normally have allowed but,0.06004746
he was new to Hollywood I think cell isn't kind of felt like you know,0.072083294
he was proud of this film whereas I do think it's it is Hitchcock's baby,0.07686197
but no offense to Selznick but it definitely feels like a Hitchcock film but he,0.034059398
did actually order some reshoots and things like that which is quite unusual for hqo,0.058647912
film so I used to watch this film with my dad growing up this is,0.029035266
one of my dad's favorite films as well she's kind of maybe why I have,0.049375918
a bit of a soft spot for it but I love movies that have some,0.030877825
kind of a mention in them I don't know what it is but haunted house,0.052712478
movies I love anything where there's like a big kind of house I just love,0.066857606
it I dunno I'm not even a big house it's just an interesting house I'll,0.061224833
go for that but if you throw in like a mystery or anything like that,0.15387028
you know I'm there so this film kind of has that gothic tone because it,0.07205602
is that like sort of foreign aid sort of a horror film it's thriller but,0.067429
it has this kind of mansion a woman in distress kind of Rebecca almost a,0.08707187
ghost you never see her or anything like that she's not moving furniture or anything,0.10098818
but even though she's dead it still feels like she's a character in this film,0.15154812
so yeah that's kind of what I love about this I mean that obviously the,0.07944621
performance is it's amazing how well they capture the tone and the style and the,0.026951246
character of the book like no one is trying to make themselves sort of different,0.030197343
or you know pulling focus it's all about stabbing the story and I just think,0.1752566
it works really well does this may be my favorite Hitchcock film um so yeah,0.040286183
I also think Rebecca as a character is so interesting because she's not actually in,0.058032617
the film there's no one plays her she's not here but she's talked about and,0.06144501
she's not a shrinking violet she's very dark and manipulative and you kind of piece,0.24504267
her together from what you know about her like she starts off as being this,0.0674137
romantic tragic figure that Maxim just can't get over but she's really not an innocent,0.036360268
victim in any way she's so unusual as a car as a female character in,0.16114606
in a movie because women don't often didn't often get these kind of really interesting,0.23760095
complex characters so I think she's kind of I understand she's really great like and,0.05146925
also ever the you know the visuals of this film are so good to the,0.027531287
restrained performance of mrs. Danvers and the costuming where Joan Fontaine is is very pretty,0.042207234
but she sort of got this slightly conventional unassuming way of dressing it's just I,0.122209534
didn't really like the incredibly high ceilings in this house and then moving Cotton's and,0.015605873
the the bedroom where Rebecca's things are never touched and mrs danvers has this sort,0.04606929
of obsessive like everything must remain the same kind of thing it's very atmospheric so,0.076501444
yeah I think and this is Danvers characters almost hypnotic I think probably what is,0.009200155
so great about this or what is handled so well is that you know any,0.0315776
of this could have just sort of fallen into melodrama very easily but it's the,0.036739424
restraint everybody's sort of restrained and nothing's ever caught too nish nobody ever gets hysterical,0.11327745
it's sort of everyone's kind of got this quiet but Channing emotion it's really great,0.06955426
so yeah this is an amazing debut film for Hitchcock in Hollywood obviously he'd done,0.05944214
quite a few things in the UK but this is an incredible entree into the,0.053748835
kind of studio system and all that kind of thing so yeah I mean this,0.03294322
is one of my all-time favorite films so I kind of I can't really recommend,0.03013947
it highly enough and I also think having seen it like a few times over,0.038220122
the years I think it means different things to me at different times I think,0.025189174
as a child I felt I didn't really care about Laurence Olivier I think I,0.038669787
really related to the new mrs. Dewinter kind of having the stuff and sort of,0.02242334
push her around and then you know now as an adult I kind of think,0.27199927
there's a transition period in all of our lives where we go from being other,0.07108485
people having direction to us having direction of our own lives and have seemed to,0.07964044
take control of situations or even move from being from being one thing to being,0.020045975
like manager of other people or even just that sense of you have an idea,0.054223776
a dream of how things are gonna be and sometimes the reality is not fitting,0.029237483
in we don't always fit in and as people often romanticize other people and I,0.070863344
think Rebecca is somebody who's romanticized by the people around her and yet she's not,0.09014236
that nice so there's a lot of kind of coming-of-age sort of concepts in here,0.071437396
it's not a coming-of-age film in any way but I think it sort of says,0.09761105
a lot about relationships and how people see them from the outside and how we,0.016343562
present ourselves and maybe even a loss of innocence but house so yeah so that's,0.021776117
Rebecca it's from 1940 it's black-and-white film I cannot recommend it I laid off absolutely,0.14850824
