DC you did I knew you had it in you [Music] Oh [Music] so Wonder Woman tells the story of Princess Diana Princess of the Amazon leaving her Amazonian island famous care for the first time to discover the world of men try and stop World War one and become Wonder Woman I'm not even going to beat around the bush people I've already shown you my excitement in my intro yes Wonder Woman is an awesome fantastic movie it's a great superhero film it's a great origin story one of the best ordered stories I've ever seen it's definitely the best movie so far this summer and it's one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it might even beat out Man of Steel is the best DC EU movie I'm on the fence about that and I'm a huge fan of that movie so that's saying a lot so all of us DC fans let's go ahead and take a collective breath once we met Green Lantern ring yeah another good movie thank you thank you we are crawling out of the depths of hell of 2016 finally we have another great DC movie thank you seriously people if you're a DC fan it's been a little bit scary lately not only was last year really disappointing for most of us I know that maybe Superman and Suicide Squad have their fans but for the most part a lot of us were disappointed by those movies there's no secret in that and all of this news that's been coming out about all the changes all the drama all these announced projects while not finishing the projects that are already in motion all the craziness of the DC EU and a lot of us did not have very much hope left well I'm here to tell you that if nothing else Wonder Woman gives you extreme hope and extreme optimism for what's to come in the DC EU learn nothing about the future let's talk about this movie that's what we're here to talk about right Wonder Woman so the star of Wonder Woman that's where I want to start off I was one of those people who was worried about gal gadot I was really on the fence I wasn't sure if they were just picking her cuz she was a pretty face or because they were trying to make a star - somebody from The Fast & Furious franchise I wasn't sure about our acting ability if she can be able to carry a movie and this is easily one of the most anticipated and one of the most iconic female roles in Hollywood history so it's very important to nail the casting well I'm here to say people I'm a believer in gal gadot they nailed the casting I absolutely fell in love with her over the runtime of Wonder Woman the story that we've heard for a couple years now is that when gal gadot sat down for the casting session for this role with zack snyder and a few WB execs they saw a spark in her they saw something there and regardless everybody's hate regardless of that everybody's doubt they casted her with extreme confidence and I'm telling you people you will see the spark by the end of this movie you'll see it within the first 30 minutes of I'm being totally honest she is charming she is electrifying especially her smile she just has this beauty about her that embodies that character of Wonder Woman you see the strength you see the value you see everything that that character needs to bring to the screen to really convey who that character is because most of us aren't really familiar with the actual core elements of that character aside from the fact that what we saw in the old incarnations of the TV show she brings everything to the forefront and even the side of the character that's a little bit naive because she's somebody who's been on a secluded Island for so long and now she's in the world of man she's in the world of all these flaws of all this death of all this hate all of that naivety of her character comes through with her performance really easily it's almost like it was second nature for her and it blew me away watching that I was like holy crap she is nailing this yep that's not going to work please put the sword down Lana Dinah let me try something up to you sir and another part of her performance that she really nailed is the chemistry and the back-and-forth between her and her love interest Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine and Chris Pine is the other strongest part of this movie they were amazing together they are one of the very few couples in a superhero movie one of those love interest couples that you immediately buy into and you're really emotionally invested in their journey in their relationship and at the end of the day you want to see more about them it's no longer about I want to see some badass action I want to see what's going to go on between those two characters the millions of people you talk about they will die I win anyway you mean you were lying you're spy that's what I do do I know you're not lying to me right now I am taking you to the front hey Chris Pine let me tell you me I have not seen Chris Pine give a bad performance yet that guy can do no wrong in my eyes so far I love this captain Curt a lot of the independent stuff that he's done like when he popped up in smokin aces one of his first roles the dude is just awesome and in this he's got the same qualities that he has when he brings Captain Kirk into this new incarnation he's got the charm he's got the wit he's got the humor and you really understand why Princess Diana would really gravitate towards this guy Steve Trevor has kind of her example for what a man is supposed to be because he has all of these characteristics and all of these traits that you would want to be exemplified in your ideal man he's got a lot of charm he's got a lot of dignity he really wants to fight the war and World War one was to take out the bad guys at all cost even if it cost him his life he is ready to put all that on the line and that's awesome and that's totally why they go together so well as a couple because diana has those same exact characteristic traits she wants to fight regardless what happens to her because it's the right thing to do and so does Steve Trevor and I'm not going to get into all of them but I will say that pretty much every single side character nails their performance and they really fit their piece into this story in this movie really well all the Amazonians like Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright they all do really they really have that badass warrior quality this island is basically the Spartans from 300 but women and their badass [Music] Lucy Davis is really funny and really entertaining in the small partner she has at a candy all of the little ragtag group had tags along with Steve Trevor into battle and the third and about halfway through the second half of this movie but they're really funny they're very similar to the ragtag group that Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes put together in Captain America the First Avenger not to compare it to a Marvel movie chill the [ __ ] out DC fans small comparison if I had to give one negative as far as characters and I know I usually save negatives for later I'm going to get it out of the way now because it's honestly the only negative I had with this entire movie is Dana Houston's character and it's not necessarily his character because his character is utilized well for the story and what his villainous role needs it to be can't really give too much detail there was going to be spoilers but Danny Huston just really hams it up and anything that he's ever done really he really hams it up he throws his cheese out there he's chewing up the scenery and he really feels out of place he feels like he's in a different movie all together and I didn't love what they were doing with his character ultimately in the third act they do pull it out of the Hat and kind of make that flaw acceptable again can't really give any spoilers but you understand what I'm talking about to see the movie so it's a very small negative but he's the only character run my hand just not buying this guy and if I can be honest I'm getting a little bit warmth in on kind of the generic stock evil German bad guy we've seen it a million times I know it fits the timeframe of when this movie came out World War one but I've seen it a million times I've seen it done better I was talking about the story because this is the element of things that the DCE use so far with the exception of Man of Steel in my opinion has really slipped up on they really try to throw a bunch of things in there there's not a whole lot of a cohesive flow to their stories they're just trying to really fast forward to catch up to get to where the Justice League is so they can be right alongside Marvel and I'm here to relieve you that Wonder Woman really takes its time and tells the story that it needs to tell from the very beginning when she's a little girl telling you all the way up to whenever she's adult how much she's trained how much she has really had this will to be the best warrior of the Amazon why she is worthy of the name of Wonder Woman why she is worthy to wield the weapon of the god killer why she is so determined to leave everything that she has ever known in her entire life good to go and help innocent people you buy into that and that's the characters that we need to have in the DCE we've seen the somber side we've seen the really downside we've seen death we've seen darkness we've seen destruction it's time for some levity it's time for some positivity and that's what Wonder Woman is she's here that you can get behind and it actually really intrigues me and excites me even though I have my doubts about Justice League about seeing her interaction with Bruce Wayne about how she is going to be a good foil for him how she's going to be that symbol for hope and that push to make him that superhero that he can be when Superman is gone because Bruce Wayne the one that we have in this current universe is down he doesn't believe in hope he doesn't believe in good he doesn't believe in humanity and Wonder Woman is the perfect character to show him why you should believe in all those things and ultimately what I love about the story of Wonder Woman and how they really tailored the story of Princess Diana in this movie is that it's not your stock boards in the story where you have a superhero that just discovers their powers and they're trying to build up enough strength throughout 90 minutes to finally take down the big bat in the third act there's elements of that but that's not what the core story this movie is about it's about a character who is good down to her core who is built and driven to protect the innocent to protect humanity finally getting exposed to the flaws of humanity but seen through those flaws and seeing the good in humanity and the reason why there is ultimately hope in the end and there is a reason to protect that hope even when you're watching the big climactic third act showdown between her and the main villain of this movie to me I wasn't watching the hero triumphing over a villain I was watching a hero triumphing over her doubt of humanity and I was incredible how they were able to blend those two things simultaneously in the same story and while I'm talking about the story there's one detailed at the very beginning of the movie in the very end of the movie that I need to comment on because I was really happy with the way that they did this the way that they incorporate the story of this movie into the overall picture of the DC EU was masterfully done because it's done really tastefully it really enhances the story and really cares to the story of who Princess Diana is and the journey she goes on in this movie it's actually kind of a really emotional moment whenever it all comes together towards the end but it doesn't distract from the fact that this is a Wonder Woman movie there's not Batman cameos there's not the flash cameos nobody's flying by in a red cape none of that's going on just a small little detail that lets you know just in case you weren't aware this is in the DC EU along with that maybe Superman and Man of Steel and all that but it doesn't distract the movie at all it actually adds to it so I thought that was a small detail that they nailed in this and a lot of the credit I got to give to the director patty Jenkins I mean we were all really optimistic from the time that this woman got signed on the director of monster is directing your Wonder Woman movie that's like a dream come true and luckily they utilized her they let her make the movie she wanted to make and we have the Wonder Woman awesome badass masterpiece movie that we have in front of us now because they trusted their director and I hope that this is a sign of things to come for the DC EU because they have a lot of great directors and a lot of great writers on their billing currently to do some of the movies that are already planned and as long as they let them make their movie the way that they let patty Jenkins make her Wonder Woman movie we're all going to be just fine but seriously patty Jenkins did an incredible job I love the way that she really structured and divided up this movie into three separate acts because each act has its own flavor its own tone and they somehow all blend together to make one really cohesive story that's not easy to do like your first act is definitely your sword and sandals movie you're introduced to the island of that mascara you get introduced to the world of the Amazonian you've got Diana and from birth all the way up to an adult you get all of that great stuff the second act is more of a period piece you get a little bit of spy movie flavor in there as where a lot of the budding romance and the relationship between Chris Pine and gal gadot really starts to grow back [Music] or maybe not and then your third act is your war movie that's when World War warm that whole setting really starts to take shape you get Princess Diana sharing all of her clothes to deal that awesome armor that looks unbelievable on gal gadot by the way walking into a hail of gunfire showing what she is made of what she is here to do what she is here represent and from then on it is just balls to the wall great action scenes great set pieces a lot of amazing camerawork especially when they're doing like horseback riding and everything the way that they shoot between the trees and the way that Patti Jing has really framed a lot of shots whenever they're doing fight scenes and you see a lot of these slow-mo flips around and there's no point in the action scenes when you can't tell what's going on it's all really cohesive it's all really focused all of that came together awesome all of the action in this movie is awesome it's all directed great gal gadot is really physical you can tell if she really trained for this role and she was not taking the role of Wonder Woman lightly she wasn't taken as a paycheck she is here to bring you the iconic female superhero that Wonder Woman is and the last thing that I really need to nail down in this review is that the score and this movie is [ __ ] incredible now I am NOT a guy that talks about scores very often I don't know very many composers name I don't really have soundtracks or any kind of scores on my iPod that I'm listening to and it's honestly a weakness whenever you look at me in trivia games Sean but from the opening frame of this movie the score literally grabbed ahold of me it's one of the greatest superhero scores that I've ever heard in my life and I might even download it to listen to it some more because it is that [ __ ] good the store itself is telling the story alongside the movie you can almost close your eyes and just listen to the score for two hours and the music is going to take you to the same journey that patty Jenkins Chris Pine and gal gadot take you in while watching these characters it's incredible so wrap all this up guys Wonder Woman is an incredible superhero movie it's a great origin story it's an incredible piece of the DC EU that we so badly needed and it just gives you a huge symbol of hope and optimism for what's to come out of the DC EU gal gadot absolutely nailed it I fell in love with her over the runtime of this movie as I'm saying it again I fell in love with her Chris Pine was incredible patty Jenkins was incredible the score was incredible only one tiny little weakness with one of the villain characters that's easily glossed over because the way that they utilized that character this movie was just a wild ride it was an absolute joy to watch I think just about everybody is going to be pleased by this I can't think of anybody who will watch this story see these characters and seek out without performance especially and walk away turning their nose up I think this is one of the best comic book movies to ever be made it's definitely one of the best DC movies to be made since the Dark Knight and it's absolutely worth your attention worth your time and worth your money so go see it in theaters and then when it comes out on home video go out and buy it so what did you guys think of Wonder Woman is this the best DC EU movie that we have gotten I'm still on the fence about that or Man of Steel keep an eye out for my ranking video I'll be having this weekend where I finally have to make that decision I need to watch Mayo steel one more time but it's definitely going to be a tight race is this your favorite DC movie that's coming out since the Dark Knight do you love gal gadot do you hate gal gadot do you love everything that this movie
