oh boy what's going on that day YouTube this is SEL zero feature zero representing James yes I'm about to review the most anticipated movie of the year 2017 Star Wars the last Jedi here we go all rights to go first off Ron Johnson de directed looper came on talked about how he was like vicious and wanted to change the scope of how this movie's gonna be worked as far as the Star Wars franchise as far as this guy Walker Stan fries then opposite from what they've been doing with anthology films and then on top of that he's been confirmed doing his own trilogy from what he was able to do with this I'm very intrigued what he's gonna do with his own trilogy because he would do if he was ever the directors very well but let's go ahead to the different things about the movie from the set pieces from the set designs to the practical effects to the practical creatures and the lifelike things throughout the entire movie this was a very well made sci-fi film like as far as just the production design the scope it was beautiful some of the moments like really surprised me everything with the temple the Jedi Temple location on the island I thought was just amazing some of the imagery they were able to do with ray and with Luke and different time jumps and different thought processes of how things are happening what things are happening are just amazing like they're very much so inspiring to actually watch and see towards the third egg there's this one moment on this planet is basically made of salt I've never seen anything like this in a Star Wars film that off the gate I can promise you you're gonna be like wow the very opening of the movie there is amazing like battle sequences some of the probably the best battle sequences they've ever had in any Star Wars movie and throughout the movie like a the way they actually able to do the cinematography there were moments I was like yo what's about to go down the sea this movie is excellent it's actually superb it certain difference extends from the way they would do certain things I'm trying not to say too much this is a non school to review of course as far as the soundtrack the soundtrack to me was better than the force awakens but it doesn't elevate it to that upper level you know to where I've seen John Williams go but this is definitely a step up and in the right directions there are certain moments where the music you change the shifts when there is dialogue between two certain characters and definitely the sequences wherever is on the island whenever is actually in space and whenever like supreme Snoke is brought into the fold into this movie I'm not going to talk to you about anything what the characters are doing but I can definitely say from a performance standpoint this is definitely Mark Hamill's possibly his best since the Empire Strikes Back performance of Luke Skywalker like he nails the sky work if you've ever doubted you know what he was able to do what he should be what you think you should go regardless of what direction Luke is being platformed into this movie Mark Hamill nails it Daisy Ridley again powerhouse the sings that it was weird there was one scene in the dark that surprised me because they really just acted it so well like that motion was just dripping and it was like a dark sequence I don't think I've ever seen like a well cried out moment like that in the dark this actually been filmed um Adam driver was given a lot to do in this one as far as acting and ability physicality they gave him a lot to work with in this one um John boyega towards the third act I really loved what they did with him but as far as what they do with his character that is where I started getting to nitpicks and possibly negativity standpoint just because of the way that they platform his arc as opposed to Wade they platform his art in [Music] the force awakens I don't like necessarily what they did with the connection of his character to everything is happening but I did enjoy the entertainment value of him interacting with this new carryin rose and what they had to do and him his self-assurance about who he's supposed to be Pro Dameron had to me a better arc than what they did with Dom boyega's character and Finn in this one because I can see where Poe is going you know I'm saying and oh my gosh r.i.p to Carrie Fisher because see I don't call her goddess but what they were able to do with her it was beautiful it was beautiful there is a negative that I can say about what they did with her character in certain instances that I feel like this is where I get into the negatives of the film I feel like the film is so ambitious has so much potential of story weight and elevation that I felt like they pulled back you know I'm saying the punch like there were certain moments in this movie that like I never saw coming there are certain revelations that I was just like what but at the end of the day from the storage standpoint of this movie it was everything that I wanted it to be from the battles from the action to the process of what the Skywalker's have been dwell with this whole entire under lock of you know the first order and Snoke like you get all these boasts of information and these great performances and these consequences that are built in literally you can see them like right in front of you right in front of your face but in the end of the day when I leave the movie there are questions that I'd literally marked on the page of paper like five different questions only two of those questions got answered and when I was hoping for and those two questions weren't what I wanted what what I thought were gonna be and then the other three never got answered it's stuff oh I left the movie with more questions and because I left the movie with more questions I don't know where to rank this movie I don't even know if I necessarily can give this movie a rating but I'm gonna try my best with that because I love business of this film I love the way it was directed I love the way the performances were in his movie I love the fights I love the battles I haven't told you guys anything about the meat of this when I get to my school review there are certain Easter eggs are certain moments dude they I just cannot Oh but at the end of the day I can't say that this is the best a kid I just I personally I personally cannot because of some of the questions the answers I got to the questions didn't merit of positive reinforcements response and then some of the questions I happen of course witness didn't get answered and now there's more questions because now I have no idea where this is going to go and at the end of the day I put myself in the shoes of those you know back in the 70s when they looked at between a new hope and Empire Strikes Back or in-between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi where you just kind of just like what happens now like that is how I feel and if you're able to do that and convey that as a director you've done your job that's why I say that he is merited a franchise because go ahead give me another trilogy and make me think make me want to have questions but I think that if some of those questions would have just wait for that gut punch and just went there and took it specifically there are certain moments in the third eye I felt like that should have went a totally different way because there are two different characters and the way that they're gonna be platformer no next is four different characters and the way they're gonna be platformed next I don't know that it makes sense and that's all I can say I'll give this move a point five out of ten I want to give it a nine but I'm gonna wait on that so I'll rest out of nine but I'll pull back and say eight point seven it was a really good movie I really enjoyed it thoroughly I cannot wait to watch it again this is my most anticipated movie this year but I think that I shouldn't have had as many questions as I do have and that's not to discourage anybody you're gonna go into this movie you're gonna enjoy you we see this movie and IMAX the visual effects are great the performances are great you're gonna get so much out of this and the richness of it you know especially if you've seen the force awakens and if your songs been this definitely elevates you moving forward but you're gonna ask yourself a lot of perplexing questions about things that happen with certain characters things that don't have my certain characters and then questions about the background of certain characters where I feel like if a little bit of background a little bit of foundation was kind of like late in this movie for certain characters dude it would merit anyway you want to take any of these characters personally so that's all I gotta say hopefully y'all enjoyed this review keeping a lot JVs Wingstop there will be a full review coming very soon in addition to that on the 17th we're gonna be doing a spoiler discussion keep it alive JVs we ain't gonna stop may the force be with you these guys
