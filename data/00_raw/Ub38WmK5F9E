[Music] now this movie has a Netflix movie but I didn't watch it on Netflix in the comfort of my house I went to an early screening two weeks ago I woke up at 8 o'clock in the morning drove 2 hours and sat in an art house theater that had the most uncomfortable chairs in all of human existence that's a small price to pay for a new Scorsese movie so now let's talk about the Irishman the Irishman starring Robert De Niro who plays a mob hitman recalling the events of his past and his criminal activity revolving around the murder of Jimmy Hoffa like I said I watched this movie for the first time in a theater and I'm sort of jealous of everyone who got to watch this for the first time on Netflix on their comfortable couch and they got to pause the movie whenever they wanted to to get up to get more popcorn take a pee or refill their drink which brings me to a profound thought I wonder if anyone actually made it through this entire film without having to go to the restroom three and a half hours movie now let's talk about the structure of this film and it's typical of what Scorsese has done with previous films you have a main character who's a criminal and he's recalling the events of his past with narration throughout the film and by the end of the film it concludes in present day with the outcome of all of those events oh yeah the structure this film is very similar to past coursezi flicks but I like that method of storytelling this film's timeline spans from the 1950s all the way to the 1990s and it all revolves around the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa who went missing in the 1970s he was murdered obviously and there's been a lot of conspiracy theories floating around of what actually happened and this film directly relates to all those events and centers around that and I'm a sucker for things like that I love historical films and speaking of Jimmy Hoffa in this film he's played by Al Pacino who's loud bombastic and he waits no longer than 10 minutes for anyone and in my opinion this was perfect casting and I loved every scene with Al Pacino because he just chews it up whoo-ha [ __ ] but the main character in this film is played by Robert De Niro and he follow his journey from a delivery driver to the right-hand man of Jimmy Hoffa and a mob boss named Russell who's played by Joe Pesci and Joe Pesci always brings a smile to my face just the way that he gives his lines in his performance I've been a fan of Joe Pesci since home alone 1 as a kid but Joe Pesci for me is really the standout throughout the film I just like the subtleties of this character named Russell but I will say my favorite performance ever from Joe Pesci was in the film casino he's just utterly insane in that film and I loved the little things that he says when he's just beating people's heads and yeah that sounds dark and morbid but I stand by it what happened in a [ __ ] tough guy told my friend stick it up let's talk about the Irishman himself Robert De Niro and what can i really say about Robert De Niro's performance it hasn't already been said six thousand other times and a much more pretentious way than I'll probably say but he's phenomenal as always it's Robert De Niro and in this film he is playing the role I've character a Frank who did all this crazy [ __ ] for the mob decades ago now my biggest fear going into this film was I was hoping that the d aging effects would look convincing and not be distracting because there's nothing worse than having great actors great performances but it feels like there's this blurry mess of CG on top of their faces because the actors in this film are in their 70s and they need to look a lot younger because the film does span from the time period of the 1950s to the 1990s and that's a long time period to really de-age actors and make them look 40-plus years younger and does the movie really do a good job of that it tries it really does try throughout this film they do their best to camouflage the de-aging effect as much as they possibly can for example when you have younger versions of Joe Pesci Al Pacino or Robert De Niro in their 30s or 40s in this film when they're actually 70 years old acting these characters they do their best to camouflage it with shadows or angles or maybe not put the camera or a hyper focus up close to their face and keep them in the distance and after 20 minutes into this movie you sort of just forget about the D aging effect because the the actors performances honestly overshadow it they're such good performances where you sort of forget oh this guy 70 years old he looks like he's 60 years old with the D aging effect but really he's supposed to be 30 years old so that's really my biggest negative from a technical standpoint with the film the Irishman but with all that said I will say the most jarring de-aging scene throughout this entire film was one of the first shots we receive Robert De Niro keep in mind he's 70 years old attempting to play a 30 year old driving this truck and the face does look slightly younger than 70 years old maybe years old nowhere close to 30 but you still see old man Robert De Niro's body and hands and I thought maybe they should have tweaked those aspects to really make it more believable now the Irishman is a mob movie directed by Martin Scorsese and it feels like a mix of a few previous other films like good fellows or casino blended together in this film and you can tell that score says he was wanting to include all his favorite things that he even puts in films or he's directed over the course of his career into one film and just have fun with it every little trope that he's done and he's perfected he put into this movie and I like that it felt like a culmination of the best hits of Martin Scorsese now let's talk about the runtime of this film it's three and a half hours long and at times when you're watching this movie it feels like you're binge watching a really good miniseries and even in the theater I was thinking to myself okay that episode could've ended right there this one could start there this one could in there this one could start there and don't get me wrong I love a slow burn I love an immersive theater experience that takes its time it develops the story and gives you everything you want and more and by the end of this movie I was fulfilled but I will say is the three and a half hour runtime completely necessary you know it's a Martin Scorsese movie Who am I to say he should cut minutes off of his movie I should have a slap my hand for such an accusation this is the part of the video where I dive into negative as I had with the story of the film and really my biggest criticism with the overall story of this film revolves around the subplot a Robert De Niro's character and his daughter throughout the film and their relationship or lack thereof because throughout the first half of this film you really feel like they're teasing something to develop out of this relationship and have a payoff by the end of the film and it never really happens you just you sort of understand that they they weren't close but you you understood that by the first half of the movie and it sort of just drags that same concept out into the end of the film and it didn't really have the payoff that I think it could have it just feels like it's sprinkled throughout the movie for the sake of being there now very quickly before I give you my final flicking thoughts on this film there is one technical aspect I did want to mention because I just found it fascinating the director of photography of this film who did a phenomenal job this movie looks beautiful times he did say throughout the film as it progresses into each modern day time period from the 50s to the 90s he D saturated the film just a little bit more as the film progressed and this was done to represent the depression and decisions that these characters are making in their lives and how it's not for the betterment of them as people and how as it progresses they become more depressed and the audience should feel that same depression and I will say as I watched the film in the theatre I did feel that way because it starts out vibrant in the 1950s and by the time you reach the end of this movie you just feel miserable and and you understand that decisions throughout your life really affect the outcome and it does make you think and that was sort of the message of this movie but no worries don't get too depressed before I give you my final flicking thoughts in this film I first want to

for watching now let's get back to the video and now feature presentation now here are my final flicking thoughts on the Irishman this film is directed by Martin Scorsese and he still has the vitality that he had 40-plus years ago this man is a master storyteller and he gets the best performances out of any actors I've ever seen in a film and every movie that I watch of his I am so captivated by it and the Irishman is no different I was really fascinated by the real-life events with the unions and Jimmy Hoffa and the things that went on behind the scenes in this film I just I loved every second of it in all reality this film is sort of like the Avengers of mob movies you have this perfect ensemble cast coming together to give this great performance so with all that said I'm going to give the Irishman an a is it my favorite Martin Scorsese film probably not is it his best mob movie in my opinion probably not does it have as much rewatch ability as some of his other films definitely not but this is a true piece of cinema and it's definitely worth watching and I think this is a movie that will resonate for years to come and it's by far the best Netflix movie ever made so now here's my question for you guys and let me know down below what did you think about the Irishman or do you guys paint houses what is your favorite mob movie of all time yeah let me know those things down below
