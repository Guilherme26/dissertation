this year if you're new to this channel my name is medium and in here,0.070674144
i aim to talk about classic movies and discover and discuss what makes them so,0.071543716
special and also the people who made them possible i'm devoting the whole month of,0.10455746
november to hopefully talk about a film noir movie each day thank you so much,0.09579017
for joining me today because we have one of my favorite film noirs of all,0.09324828
time and beyond that one of my favorite films will stop and that is none,0.07248548
other than double indemnity so sit back relax because we're going to talk about film,0.15876392
noir magic here and so with no more ado let's jump into it there's a,0.25917494
quote by alfred hitchcock saying since double indemnity the two most important words in motion,0.14988461
pictures are billy and wilder and that is just a hint of the extent of,0.071670555
the impact that double indemnity had upon its release and furthermore the movie has persistently,0.114713356
and quite rightfully so as one of the best examples of film noir i'm sure,0.09629598
wilder wasn't aware that he was filming a film noir but he certainly helped shape,0.07514843
the themes the atmosphere the archetypes the characters that made and continue to make this,0.036452223
genre so popular and so fascinating having said that this is also a film that,0.070598476
beyond any genre it's a billy wilder movie and one of the greatest assets of,0.0849724
this film as in most of the movies by wilder is the script is the,0.075658426
writing for double indemnity it had not only one fantastic writer but three wilder who,0.20779273
frequently worked with a writing partner in this period was normally charles brackett who for,0.028918445
this movie stepped out of the project found in this case in raymond chandler who,0.11611496
was an accomplished crime fiction writer the best possible writing partner to adapt a fantastic,0.15486504
novella by james malahan kane another prominent figure of crime fiction and quite frankly these,0.16314362
two writers are my favorites the relationship between chandler and wilder in this movie was,0.060219098
far from ideal they clashed many times but the results of the movie are outstanding,0.048200324
you can even see for a brief moment chandler in this movie who makes a,0.12444804
cameo and it's the only time he appeared in movies and also james malhankan was,0.06857969
very pleased very happy with the results of their adaptation of his original novella and,0.062043022
that's something that doesn't happen often so kudos to chandler and wilder the original novel,0.0969603
was based on a true crime that took place in 1927 when ruth snyder and,0.09899388
her lover killed her husband to get double indemnity in her husband's life insurance and,0.7805601
that he was a writer whose work was frequently brought to the screen and you'll,0.06724473
probably be familiar with also mildred pierce and the postman always rings twice two of,0.037341617
his most famous and fantastic work so as you can see we're dealing here with,0.048207
heavy powerhouses billy wilder in turn was predominantly known for writing and then directing comedies,0.06672956
and with this movie he raced above all genres as not only a fantastic sharp,0.15433177
writer but also as a great filmmaker in double indemnity he used voice overs we,0.062482364
have a quite amount executives but in any case it's remained one iconic from fatale,0.05825009
of the genre who is also marvelously dressed by eddie head and she plays a,0.12984166
ruthless yet super charismatic lady that it's again right up there with the best examples,0.24372798
of this very cinematic archetype so they are razor sharp dialogues full of sexual innuendo,0.6364068
and i think that especially the voice over the fred mcmurray who plays walter neff,0.08751552
the main character of this movie has it is beyond amazing and i think it's,0.09673039
been spoofed many times when they try to recreate the genre in a comedic way,0.108182415
and again especially fred mcmurray's character with lines like i couldn't hear my footsteps it,0.10601459
was the walk of a dead man or how could have i known that murder,0.5345175
sometimes smell like honeysuckles let me tell you that he plays here in my opinion,0.24017166
even though he has fantastic co-stars like again barbara stanway or edward g robinson i,0.15450378
think that fred mcmurray in this movie is outstanding he was cast against type in,0.15273911
fact i think all of them are cast against type because in mcmurray's case he,0.2558476
was predominantly known for playing good guys in light comedy screwball comedies in the 30s,0.12774104
and 40s too barbara stanway in turn had played dramas had had terrific performances in,0.083092496
comedies too pre-code dramas prank copper dramas certainly very intense but she had never played,0.11247206
a role like this before and conversely edward g robinson who was known mostly for,0.14956325
playing gangsters in the 30s he plays here quite an agreeable character in fact the,0.15535839
chemistry he has with fred in this movie is the sweetest i think relationship that,0.06515715
we see in double indemnity so i think that they were all again cast against,0.14255914
type and it worked wonders it's one i think of the successes of this movie,0.0660564
aside from the writing the movie released in 1944 also the year that as i,0.052643742
said in my previous video phantom lady laura were also released it helped in a,0.14143056
way launched the genre and it became clear that audiences were very keen at that,0.043402653
time to watch this type of stories brought to the screen one of the most,0.050817885
captivating things about this film is the fact that crime is associated with relatively ordinary,0.14912853
people so unlike 30s gangster movies where crime was attributed to criminals in this case,0.28374976
as also happened with phantom lady crime happens to again relatively common people but there,0.15433264
is that element that is so fantastic that the genre brought and is that fatality,0.07693957
we are watching characters that are doomed from the get-go and there's that element of,0.052550137
there's no escaping my fate and it also presents characters that don't show any regret,0.087683804
for the crimes they commit it's more like an stoic acceptance of what's coming to,0.1089439
them and that's quite fascinating and in turn quite revealing of the era in which,0.07407991
these movies were made and released i particularly love the scene in which the crime,0.19327523
is committed i think that the way it was shot in which we can only,0.18378335
see barbara stanwick's face the way she acts in that scene is amazing and it,0.26455072
is one of my favorite scenes from the movie it is also known that billy,0.06410038
wilder filmed two endings for the movie which i'm obviously not going to reveal but,0.1717516
i'll only say that the one that it's in the actual movie is quite characteristic,0.092365354
of wilder's work so again we have many elements that helped shape film noir but,0.06602927
this is also very much a billy wilder film so for those of you who,0.24125235
are not that familiar with the genre but do love wilder's work you cannot miss,0.09466221
