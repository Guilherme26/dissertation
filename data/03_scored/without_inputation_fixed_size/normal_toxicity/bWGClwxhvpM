so hi and welcome to the channel to the first part of what i'm mostly,0.063131645
calling my first season of my french cinema season plan is to take one film,0.07312687
roughly from each decade from the 1930s up and talk about it in terms of,0.055006027
theme in terms of plot in terms of ideas and imports relevance to the events,0.04608048
of the world that were going around long around that time and what was happening,0.06162393
around cinema and why this film is worth talking about or worth watching and a,0.14060077
mixture of these films will be either films that have seen either once or more,0.10184568
times beforehand or a film that i watched that seemed to fit or be different,0.07392246
enough around that time to talk about and if i'm gonna start in the 1930s,0.11711134
there's really no other place to start off than well one of the most important,0.091886036
i would say films of all time or one that many people will revere for,0.06590204
numerous reasons and we'll discuss reasons why that may be you may be familiar with,0.049714435
it you may not you may have heard about it you might not have but,0.13774538
it is the film that has got infamy certainly in boutique blu-ray collecting circles as,0.16402386
being spine number one in the criterion collection that is jean-ren mars or grand illusion,0.06435569
the grown religion is a 1936 film which stars jean-gaban as a co-pilot or a,0.13815631
helper for a pilot who was shot down in an enemy territory and captured by,0.28416708
the germans now this is all set in world war one and while the film,0.31791285
is a war film it is a war film of taste or it is not,0.15085575
a bombastic war film that many were filmed you've seen before because there's hardly a,0.083495684
bullet fired there's hardly a shout of anger this is a film about the nicer,0.23563507
side of war or what happens behind the scenes in war it talks about the,0.11590534
relationships between the people that are both together and their captors and what john menmore,0.28672844
was thinking about that jungkook is a mechanic to the more celebrated captain blonde they,0.0510524
are thrust together into the same captivity and what you have is a film that,0.13109429
explores like i say relationships between different nationalities but also relationships around aristocracy and working,0.10292264
class and really this is what the film is about regardless of experiences of war,0.10402187
because on one level we have captain blunder the captured french officer who's from the,0.11095047
aristocracy and then you have erik vance throughheims character van rothenstein who is the german,0.26819354
aristocrat who's his captor and one of the ideas that renoir had and that he,0.11230284
has said about subsequently is that our circumstances are the things that bind us together,0.045256924
he often says rather than the frenchness of each other being the people our nationality,0.15511174
that binds us together that is our experiences so he uses the experience or the,0.050845865
example of a chinese farmer in a french farmer meeting as long as they could,0.3115346
get over the language buyer they would have lots to speak about whereas the aristocracy,0.05700765
and the working class have left to speak around well once they get the their,0.05837438
common bond of being french out of the way so these are these are the,0.09098881
themes that are explored within and sure enough when rothenstein and captain blunder bond over,0.14869866
their common upbringing there is a camaraderie around people of same class even in war,0.367347
situations and they will dine together just like the working class can dine together but,0.05374303
one of the other nice things that comes into this is that the aristocracy in,0.0641684
the work class they see that these things are changing in the modern world so,0.042209428
things like wealth are going to break down these class buyers if you have enough,0.13179593
wealth it can subjugate or tear apart these boundaries an example being one of the,0.1500839
captors is a jewish banker he comes from a family of juice bankers and they,0.31089434
have wealth and while there he's in captivity together with the other people that are,0.060256664
supposedly of working class they can eat quite well because his family sent him food,0.07134143
packages into captivity and they eat lavishly just like the aristocracy and while blunder and,0.05220556
von rafenstein think about you know how this they're the last bastions of that generation,0.1521048
it is born out with what you have here and while there are other things,0.09749912
and there are other parts of this film brought to the fore it is these,0.05637948
that stick in the mind the idea that those in captivity are trying to escape,0.08701997
is one that runs throughout the film as they're thwarted by both circumstance or by,0.034840394
otherwise and you get this really wonderful taste of even at the end of high,0.15044875
barriers and neat people's needs circumvent that the underlying themes are the underlying beliefs that,0.073631294
are there i do intend to talk about some of the relationships between the director,0.063777134
and what they they made though because jean renoir was somebody that fought in the,0.08161763
first world war he had an injury that he sustained and he this is sort,0.2555872
of loosely autobiographical about many of the experiences that he thought he had or experienced,0.06882023
around that time and what was supposedly a gentleman's world world war one and on,0.19335085
the back of her in the face of world war two coming across which was,0.47072965
a very militant war which was much more about technology which was much more about,0.109727435
hatred this contrasts with what world war one was now on the side of this,0.31089434
you have what actually happened the film itself and this is i think one of,0.072086014
the lovely bits of story that actually where art mimics life because this film was,0.10500106
used insane as bit of a a bit of a populist piece around war and,0.4314205
what war should be and what it shouldn't be so much so that when the,0.11264566
nazis seen it they confiscated it they got rid of the film they did not,0.34954366
want it seen when roosevelt seen it in america for his i'm sure as a,0.06589122
part of the birthday party for his wife he fell in love with the film,0.08131214
he wanted it widely seen he thought this was the very embodiment of what a,0.14271933
modern society should be so while he was praising it the nazis were looking rid,0.44120145
of it this kind of idea of populist or using the film as a way,0.10628781
to tell a message or to spread the good word was at very much at,0.07515245
the far ends of the spectrum in fact lagrand illusion was confiscated so much that,0.056227747
people thought it was lost the time turns out that it was in the russian,0.1333601
health part of berlin and they decided to take it away with them for many,0.104723394
years and put it in the moscow film foundation and it was only returned to,0.053196866
france around 1960 toulouse uh for restoration and for looking at and as a a,0.1457522
piece of of grand cinema other prints that were used at the time there was,0.05841295
one put out in 1948 there were there were pieced together from other surviving elements,0.081043005
but the original fulfillment was only really brought back in that stage and then later,0.05357499
they were re-scanned and cleaned up and and the film that we see today bores,0.09880059
bears fruit from that it has a stunningly beautiful picture even by modern standards in,0.15157443
the form that we have it the release that i had which was the studio,0.040544365
canal version has lots of really considered extras both about the journey of the film,0.05864429
how it passed from nation to nation and how those nations had to work together,0.15730582
for a common goal of restoring this film and the fact that nobody actually did,0.078231566
even though it was heated by the nazis they didn't actually destroy it they held,0.40337566
on to it and stored it away so it wouldn't be seen and as many,0.09263531
parts of of nazi life they appreciated art and there was a appreciation of how,0.4031328
powerful art could be in so far as you know girls had lenny reefing style,0.15299122
make propaganda films so so this is this is the film that we see today,0.07500428
and one that i desperately think everybody should check out in some way should perform,0.16370961
thanks for watching and i'll catch you next time when we go to the 1940s,0.1683231
and as well as a surprise and for let you prepare i'll tell you what,0.05273611
film that i'm going to do i'm going to talk about panic by jules de,0.09810106
vivre a story about another jewish person in the face of war i'll catch you,0.68729925
