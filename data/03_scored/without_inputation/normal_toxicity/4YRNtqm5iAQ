the cabinet of dr. Caligari this is a 1920 film from Robert wine an absolute,0.059736315
classic kind of a horror fan rite of passage because many many do credit this,0.12102944
as being really the first film to be categorized as horror as something meant to,0.17784329
to scare audiences and you know chill them to their core things like that and,0.11798687
it is a silent film 1920 a German film a German expressionist film so with,0.052018274
that you get a lot of the exaggerated set pieces and real kind of surreal,0.15512285
nightmarish kind of look to it where it's it's not meant to kind of reflect,0.10978746
reality but kind of I don't know reflect the mental state of the characters within,0.18448561
this nightmarish kind of world so that works really well and you obviously I mean,0.14889175
you can kind of look a little closer and see that there may be like,0.06688616
cardboard cutouts said sort of paper things like that but 1921 when the camera like,0.10120499
was stagnant you know not moving around it you can kind of get away with,0.13489133
that kind of visual trickery which I mean this film has to be the absolute,0.13710035
best example of something like that of the German expressionist kind of kind of thing,0.20335813
well I had seen the movie a few times before this month actually I had,0.086150676
the opportunity to catch it on the big screen see it a theater with with,0.05484131
a live score played for the filament and that was really cool and and really,0.038669784
cool like it was almost a full house so it was very nice to see,0.07299021
that it looks like the the lure of the good doctor still still can bring,0.060882594
in audiences to this day and and still hopefully scare people so that is that,0.11159924
was great basic part of the movie it is we have this sort of like,0.069875844
the main character Francis he's he's recalling the story of meeting this doctor and how,0.052860092
basically the doctor Caligari he he travels from town to when they have fairs and,0.06316674
in this this particular town is having their fair their festival whatever you want to,0.053706083
call it and his attraction is some nebulous sleepwalker I guess named Caesar the the,0.23968476
tall spooky looking fella that's that's the most memorable kind of visual of this movie,0.239022
I guess you could argue and this scare probably the scariest thing about it the,0.1013678
attraction is he's forever asleep I think he's been asleep for 23 years but when,0.10242347
he awakens him for the audience he has the ability to see the past see,0.076253004
the future read fortunes things like that and it certainly affects some of some people,0.109667584
and and basically what starts happening is within this small town there are murders happening,0.17762089
and we begin to suspect and of course the main character and the the police,0.31206506
force they begin to suspect that it might have something to do with this dr.,0.078824885
Caligari and his sleepwalker and it's about piecing that all together there's a general plot,0.12770344
of the movie it's I mean of course you know it's it's a very influential,0.09414037
film where I mean like some obvious examples like David Bowie and and his Ziggy,0.09195313
Stardust persona was very much inspired by the Caesar character even if you like watch,0.099827915
Rob Zombie's video the living dead girl basically it's like almost like you know shot-for-shot,0.6364068
cabinet of dr. Caligari stuff like that and like a lot of modern movies really,0.075746164
take examples from this and storytelling techniques from this movie to this day this 100,0.0718583
year old movie so I mean I like I'll probably be getting into spoilers here,0.1509741
so if you don't want this century-old movie spoiled for you I mean short reviews,0.4312398
this check it out definitely check it out and if by any chance you do,0.06580952
have an opportunity to catch a screening with a live score see it with an,0.093397185
audience absolutely take advantage of that it was a great experience but I mean what,0.0743053
it it has inspired a lot like within horror genre and thriller and things like,0.08100754
that is the display of the mental state of madness and how a story establishes,0.463487
that because really this this is kind of I mean first silent film from 1920,0.072920874
it's really ambitious plot wise and very layered plot wise and quite complex where we,0.07687344
do have kind of like a a story within a story than a big twist,0.06325145
and where with the the category character everyone's trying to figure it out Francis's best,0.050176416
friend is killed by Caesar and he's trying to figure it out with the police,0.53490317
they they track it down to the mental institution where the director of this institution,0.3698729
is the spitting image of this Caligari and we learned through his diary that he,0.23976699
had become obsessed with supposedly the real Caligari and he wanted so badly to learn,0.19360529
the ways of some Nambu lism and using a sleepwalker to perform your will having,0.1995948
control over them being their master and doing things that they normally wouldn't do that,0.103308
they would find a testable such as murderers as we see with with Caesar and,0.5489074
so he kind of steals his identity in a way but we wonder how can,0.31089434
this really be so I mean the the big twist of the movie is that,0.09159616
the the character Francis the the man he's speaking to is is actually just another,0.05581399
patient within the institution and this whole thing has kind of been within his mind,0.05715204
but is it really or is it actually the the insidious work of dr. Caligari,0.10335134
because there is kind of there there's this final shot in that film before they,0.13902886
they iris out where you know everyone within the story of the film appears in,0.049695604
the end as patients where you think okay he's just used those as examples within,0.09212847
his mind you play out this deranged fantasy of his and they take him away,0.6131802
at the end and Caligari he's like ah yes okay i understanded lusion now I,0.09701226
can help him but then he kind of like gives this little look - like,0.093766004
suggest that maybe this is this has all been his doing is kind of like,0.062173884
a supernatural twist to it so there is kind of a blend of the supernatural,0.11092427
and a blend of just the psychotic of this main character so we kind of,0.40605342
we're left to wonder how much of each it is affecting the overall story so,0.068314955
that's pretty clear and like eaec like with any movie where it kind of like,0.08374127
you know turns out in a twist that the person was was crazy all times,0.48258197
it was a delusion the whole time I mean it's it's been done time and,0.11109937
time again and this movie had really kind of set the groundwork for that where,0.061259717
you know in with these sets and kind of having the the surreal visual style,0.08236191
to what we see the environment within where these characters are are living you know,0.026577218
the the skewed doors and the flooring that's like kind of all centering into this,0.09114394
character in a very specific kind of way is it's all really cool and and,0.045594413
even kind of stuff like where we see when reading the diary the madness of,0.09318659
the institutions director where he's seeing like he's gone totally insane he's seeing in in,0.4517307
the sky on the trees on the doors become Caligari over and over again and,0.059785936
kind of establishing that mental breakdown and like visual cues like that so like all,0.25472516
that kind of stuff I mean you can kind of trace back to this movie,0.150577
so it is highly influential but I mean at the same time it does work,0.06915522
really well you know on its own it I think it still holds up well,0.063608706
as a scary movie like even like you know it is kind of scary or,0.18242592
spookier to see a movie like this where it is I don't know just because,0.12671794
it is so old because it is silent because the image we see feels just,0.051469248
a little ghost leer I guess I don't know quite what it is but there,0.07281939
is something really really creepy about silent films and and especially this one that you,0.22163033
know it it does tell its story so effectively visually right not just you know,0.058460716
within some of the over-the-top stuff but you know obviously the the title cards which,0.060057163
even like in the original German they're they're very kind of over the top and,0.13674603
and twisted themselves meanwhile like if you're an english-speaking audience member you just kind of,0.5216695
see the little subtitle bottom which which isn't too much but still still very effective,0.15355197
in telling the story and a spooky scary story indeed it is and the this,0.11820543
version that I saw like I think some versions have like just plain black and,0.27661207
white I guess but this one I saw it had kind of like the tints,0.2892945
to it to you know set certain look at them you know like that a,0.058232002
light yellow tint or a light red tint and things like that and this version,0.07082317
must have been some guy list a semi recent restoration because the movie looks great,0.077893764
it almost looks like a modern movie trying to look like an older movie like,0.15471597
this which is pretty cool and of course I you know I really enjoyed the,0.060419988
the live musical accompaniment which is really good it was the band is called the,0.0628642
invincible Tsar's who they're an Austin band and they traveled the US and Canada and,0.053042505
they made their way up to my neck of the woods and I was able,0.18867046
to see that so I mean I can't recommend strongly enough that if if they,0.08752326
do happen to be playing in your town one of these one of these presentations,0.08851839
absolutely take a look much like Calgary himself kind of touring around and in bringing,0.20528008
horror to the unsuspecting audiences and things like this a very influential film of course,0.13653488
very hat film and kind of being the first in the horror genre and establishing,0.12969631
all these kinds of psychosis and and supernatural and very visually scary just certain images,0.27069658
from the film just standalone are just so eerie looking and it's so well done,0.059071425
absolute classic I love the movie a rite of passage I'd say for any kind,0.119507484
of horror fame you want to kind of see where it all kind of started,0.19539611
kind of the the first horror movie if you won't call it that and that's,0.13962728
that's at the cabinet of dr. Caligari so if you can't check out one of,0.046572335
the the performances I'm sure you can find it pretty much and I don't think,0.11551755
it's I think it might be in the public domain but you can probably easily,0.05523822
find it pretty much anywhere pretty pretty accessible I would say so if you haven't,0.14968152
seen it before if you don't mind the spoilers that I gave you definitely check,0.055420946
it out well worth it well worth bringing to the table to your Halloween who,0.19237019
are viewing if you're doing a a marathon like I am this month 31 days,0.18648337
of horror plenty more reviews to come stay tuned for those until next time stay,0.092924096
