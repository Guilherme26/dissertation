black clans mint directed by Spike Lee is a biographical drama film that takes place,0.0055802255
in 1970s Colorado Springs where a man by the name of Ron Stallworth is desperate,0.018408293
to prove himself within the Colorado Springs Police Department Ron eventually becomes a detective where,0.022904934
he works undercover with Adam drivers character flip to infiltrate the local chapter of the,0.025216447
white supremacist group known as a Ku Klux Klan Ron calls the white supremacist and,0.45812118
pretends to be a white supremacist himself and named Ron Stallworth and Flip actually attends,0.221729
events under that name as the two tried to infiltrate the KKK and tear them,0.2064597
down things get very dangerous for both of them r17 to see black Klansmen for,0.42100498
a while now it's been getting a lot of rave reviews and a lot of,0.013404781
buzz and I'm actually a big fan personally of Adam drivers so he's probably mostly,0.03651725
what drew me to go see this one in theaters I've never actually seen another,0.026629297
Spike Lee movie but I do know a lot of people really loved his work,0.07056069
so that probably played into a little bit for me as well I like black,0.14422046
Klansmen a lot of ultimately I don't think it's quite Best Picture good but it's,0.029270075
certainly one of the best films that come out this year thus far I don't,0.027714211
think this one will make my top ten list at the end of the year,0.029471627
because Oscar season hasn't really kicked in yet we haven't hit a lot of the,0.04824843
great films yet but I think this is a very good film with a lot,0.054308254
going for it I think black clansmen is a very good very well rounded film,0.3180563
that certainly succeeds in a handful of different areas at a high level firstly I,0.02775745
think the story is very well put together it's pace well the characters are interesting,0.011218987
and the story feels genuine to its source material the memoirs of the real Ron,0.018556628
stallworth himself this story feels like an honest telling of events that led to some,0.024820663
even more odd and unlikely defeats of evil the film dedicates a lot of time,0.07165225
showing you how dangerous and just purely awful these white supremacists are how they're motivated,0.4772985
by hatred for anyone of a different race anyone that's different than them but the,0.40752253
same time they're decently well organized and skeptical of anyone who may prove damaging to,0.04980762
their cause the story gets odd because the way the detectives actually infiltrate the KKK,0.05680136
chapter is kind of remarkably bad so bad that the villains never truly considered it,0.053121567
as a possibility because it just made no logical sense that's where a lot of,0.030394236
the humor comes in something else that black Klansmen does fairly well I'm not gonna,0.27308777
say this is a hilarious film or anything like that but there certainly are scenes,0.033954963
that are pretty funny and sort of lighten the mood every now and then what's,0.03373013
interesting though is that a lot of this humor feels very Tarantino like a lot,0.043624073
of the movie does actually a way less violent Tarantino though it's just comfortable poking,0.034017492
fun at taboo subject matter like racism and it does so in a way that,0.22896563
feels sort of awkwardly light-hearted it's to start contrast with the more serious tones that,0.016249772
resonate more deeply and more often but it actually does provide a nice change of,0.013301012
pace overall John David Washington and Adam driver both to a nice job of being,0.018994983
funny but also being dramatic as well the versatility carries the movie quite a bit,0.040487066
because they're asked to show off different skill sets at different times and it all,0.016595667
works super well John David Washington and Adam driver actually do a lot of the,0.019932227
heavy lifting here John David Washington handles the lead duties for the first act and,0.020526903
then as the film progresses sort of becomes like a co-lead situation where he and,0.016186578
Adam drivers share the responsibilities and share the spotlight they both have tons of great,0.019808503
moments and while I don't think either these performances are ultimately going to be Academy,0.015881259
nominated performances the both still really good some of the best I've seen this year,0.01655376
thus far I've only ever seen John David Washington in the HBO show ballers where,0.025488507
he plays a supporting character but I have a feeling he's gonna start laying some,0.031270947
bigger roles after his great work in this movie Adam driver is just continuing to,0.021396963
impress me more and more with each passing film in fact I think he's getting,0.05812641
better with each passing film this time around he plays a character with a subtlety,0.04912714
and nuance that works very well in conjunction with John David Washington's performance it's a,0.011713884
little more in-your-face but still awesome speaking of subtlety and nuance I think this is,0.10841629
one area where black Klansmen could probably improve I felt locked in for a lot,0.15559044
of the film really engaged to the setting and the oddball nature of the story,0.056694932
and the hopeful downfall of this local KKK chapter they're showing us where the film,0.07551231
took me out of the experience though is when it comes across as if it's,0.035433
trying too hard to say something meaningful about issues we face in today's climate and,0.019366821
then there probably was a way to do this a little more subtly a little,0.024305144
more naturally but sadly that's just not Spike Lee's style at points in this film,0.030293794
there's moments where I felt sucked out of the immersive aspects because I just felt,0.1471792
the directors political end goals too clearly present in the source material it feels less,0.017385906
like a movie at that point and more like a political lecture which is something,0.026770316
that I'm personally not really looking for out of a movie going experience if you,0.042829845
can weave it in nacho to the story and then more power to you that's,0.023286084
great but if you're forceful about it it just kind of kills the immersion when,0.33341026
it happens something else Spike Lee does here that bothered me a bit was the,0.040468443
seemingly intentional means of editing the choppy there's that time the lack of continuity between,0.051068146
cuts especially when two or three characters are just talking to one another and there's,0.016205205
a method where text is used in a way that feels out of sync with,0.023241516
the rest of the film the editing is perfectly fine oftentimes but it's sometimes just,0.042587716
awkward and that's another place where the emergence uppers a bit because of that it,0.061651215
seems like an artistic decision because it's done in deliberate moments to add a sort,0.033207964
of awkward charm to the 70's style film but it just feels off the editing,0.03385452
choices aren't always the greatest with this one that said there are a lot of,0.01745974
things I really liked about black clansmen and I do think it has a very,0.063054755
powerful message the message to me was that racism is real and that it evolves,0.14603642
and changes over time to take new forms as society changes and evolves itself I,0.063043445
also took away that racism and hatred can lead to isolation on both sides this,0.16773537
kind of division only creates more division and more animosity between people that shouldn't ever,0.03917333
feel any of those things towards each other simply because of the color of their,0.13065138
skin this was an extremely tumultuous time for african-americans especially and in response many of,0.11092736
them felt the need to defend themselves it's a natural reaction and it makes sense,0.01691429
if you feel threatened but I think the film tries to sort of point out,0.04577528
how both sides just retreat further and further into their own sides and just hate,0.05895323
each other with the gap that widens even further day by day there's just a,0.09839995
lot to digest here and it's mostly insightful and effective overall though I found black,0.12960903
Klansmen to be a very good film certainly one of the better ones I've seen,0.029345242
this year I don't think it's quite gonna make it to the Oscar discussion but,0.015788134
you never know it has a powerful enough message that it just might as for,0.035504177
the pros cons for the pros I thought black Klansmen delivered a well-rounded and unique,0.08455682
historical story lots of insightful commentary on important topics two great leading performances and some,0.01298505
nice humor that balances the entire experience as for the cons I found the film,0.021390976
lacks subtlety in certain key spots and it's editing choices weren't the greatest I'm still,0.09724918
gonna give black plans but a nine out of ten because I think the pros,0.16547175
outweigh the cons here if you're interested in a historical drama film with the quality,0.056907125
message this is a good choice so did you guys see black Klansmen yet what,0.22301546
did you think of it and if not let me know why not I'd almost,0.038315244
let me know the movie you're most looking forward to that's coming out in 2018,0.038841404
I'll drop mine in the comments below because I honestly got a thing long and,0.15529244
hard about that one either way this is wolf box if occations iding off see,0.11676501
