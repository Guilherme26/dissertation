trailers review of Mad Max fury road oh what a day what a lovely day,0.18134333
wanna get through this it would seem that the only thing standing between George Miller,0.09488157
and cinematic glory is 150 million dollars yes that's the budget for Mad Max fury,0.15879838
road and if Miller delivers he'll provide a strong argument that Studios should have more,0.058392543
faith in creative talent and let them loose with hundreds of millions of dollars to,0.10147867
play with then again while Miller isn't a sure bet he's still a solid bet,0.08821324
the creator of the original Mad Max trilogy Miller has since impressed with The Witches,0.28130496
of Eastwick babe pig in the city and two Happy Feet movies speaking of Happy,0.5154597
Feet for a time Miller toyed with the idea of making Mad Max fury road,0.15106873

bid to get the movie made after 25 years in development Mel Gibson had dropped,0.07485518
out long ago and was it welcome back after making the wrong kind of headlines,0.1426325
Plus for a while all the shooting locations Miller had in mind were considered a,0.09502843
security risk but while animated films aimed at adult audiences are quite popular in Asia,0.06650077
perhaps Miller felt fury road was risky enough without the added hurdle of trying to,0.07197579
convince Western audiences that animation could evolve beyond family entertainment too bad especially because Mad,0.3396458
Max fury road might be a tough sell even as a live-action film emulating the,0.070243925
work of legendary mainstream photographer Pete Ehrlich whose galleries are a Vegas staple Miller's fourth,0.08400842

and further complicating matters is Gibson's replacement tom hardy Hardy signed onto the film just,0.08856673
as he was becoming a household name thanks to inception in the Dark Knight Rises,0.0670869
but then that star power never materialized but Warner Brothers still has high hopes for,0.061033398
Mad Max fury road not only making it a focal point during their last comic-con,0.2635577
presentation but citing Hardy for three more movies that's right these days Hollywood finds itself,0.10444619
in the movie version of an arm race with each studio trying to lay claim,0.1327038
to as many franchises as they can but while Warner Brothers wants Mad Max to,0.15910842
compete as a blockbuster meaning a movie that's commercially viable our Mad Max movies commercially,0.12572515
viable George Miller just did a major solid for artistic filmmakers everywhere I mean this,0.07763935
movie isn't just great it's like AFI top 100 films of all time great it's,0.065009214
so grotesque both visually and emotionally that it becomes something beautiful and straight up as,0.36080635
this movie demonstrates if the apocalypse ever does come and you're not a white dude,0.6329093
run for your life however to be honest the civilized world isn't much better and,0.25099644
I think a lot of people trying to make their way in this world regardless,0.103496954
of ethnicity or gender will be able to relate to Mad Max fury road I,0.16178904
certainly did but then some people will not and I say that because at the,0.10397143
end of the film there's a quote that comes up on the screen and at,0.051517326
the press screening I attended when that quote came up some people laughed at it,0.083515264
dismissing Lee which was unfortunate because it was both unimportant and brilliant waked and the,0.15365443
movie and we'll discuss that in my spoiler review but here I will say that,0.06411368
it makes me a tiny bit worried about the box-office prospects for Mad Max fury,0.23067059
road because it's definitely a blockbuster with a high art sensibility and there's a reason,0.07432532
that high art depends on a few buyers with deep pockets rather than mass appeal,0.094155096
but then again Apocalypse Now was a very big set of commercially so maybe there,0.1033286
is hope for Mad Max fury road and yes I did just compare Mad Max,0.24230127
fury road to Apocalypse Now I would say by way of Cirque du Soleil and,0.17509386
I mean that I mean that the Cirque du Soleil aspect in a positive way,0.10714297
however if you don't appreciate Cirque du Soleil well let's just say that at the,0.14393628
press screening I attended there were two types of people in the audience those that,0.05311014
applauded the movie and those that laughed at the movie and I'm not just talking,0.07889068
at the end of the movie I'm talking during the actual film that's how engaged,0.09297579
people work even if it was sometimes in a negative manner people laughter applauded after,0.10616921
scenes and action set-pieces also speaking of watching this movie you must must must must,0.15379095
must must must see it in 3d seriously if you don't see Mad Max fury,0.27206066
road in 3d then you are not seeing it as it was intended to be,0.12447652
seen and the 3d is spectacular now I'll go into details in my spoiler review,0.06608709
but here I want to just go over some broad strokes first off the world-building,0.15866376
in this movie is amazing not just in its attention to detail but its realism,0.12561102
how well it's thought-out George Miller has done a fantastic job you know realizing the,0.06911898
infrastructure of this you know post-apocalyptic situation that he's created and also its military prowess,0.15425418
I mean it's really really impressive and I think some credit goes to his screenwriter,0.091497906
who is a UK comic-book writer and I think that you can definitely see that,0.09431858
DNA in the film both UK comics which are pretty distinct and also the post-apocalyptic,0.04390014
genre and comics which actually the UK tends to specialise in so that's very impressive,0.07620118
now as for the actors we're going to discuss here are two leads and we'll,0.06693563
discuss everybody else in the spoiler review now Charlize Theron Wow if Tom Hardy wasn't,0.08198446
so good-looking this would 100% be her movie she is amazing what a fantastic role,0.06620612
not just for a woman but anyone and she nails it watching this movie I,0.24154873
was said that she's not Wonder Woman I mean gal gadot really has the bar,0.39117104
raised substantially by Mad Max fury road and Charlize Theron performance but maybe she'll be,0.18592185
Captain Marvel or somebody if some studio doesn't snap her up after this for some,0.17448173
kind of franchise it'll be I think they will but it would be a major,0.060934924
missed opportunity this should be the film that makes Charlize Theron finally an action star,0.05555451
she's been trying for a while with Aeon Flux and Prometheus but this is her,0.14164425
moment this is it she is just spectacular and then Tom Hardy is very good,0.095070325
and it's so nice to see his face he often hi he hides it for,0.34065568
a good deal of this film actually so when it does come back it really,0.08129824
makes an impression and not just because he's good-looking but because it's a powerful acting,0.06792423
tool for him I mean he has a very rich a rich and expressive face,0.34835613
and he shouldn't hide it all the time and speaking of hiding things you get,0.06596071
the feeling that Tom Hardy is almost afraid to let loose with his full acting,0.12109943
prowess which is weird I don't understand why he does that and you know you,0.15480104
could argue that Mad Max is holding back but I think it's more than that,0.22415482
you get the feeling that like Tom Hardy is afraid of his own acting ability,0.15061413
and I don't understand it I think it's weird I wish someone would say unleash,0.1603381
your inner acting beasts Tom Hardy don't be afraid you know your inner movie star,0.6751181
even I mean he's clearly a movie star I would say the he and Ryan,0.21044016
Gosling actually have the same problem and they could start some kind of support group,0.09994906
for guys who should be at the top of Hollywood but for some reason I,0.069571845
keep tripping themselves up and now I want to end my review coming back to,0.40315637
George Miller because it's just so wonderful to see a filmmaker who's paid his dues,0.15055588
I mean he started out with Mad Max but then he went to Hollywood and,0.15106164
he was a part of the Hollywood machine he made his big you know solidly,0.074508354
commercial successes you know he put always his own twist on it but you know,0.12976338
he had his happy feet as we discussed in the opening he produced the babe,0.08914026
and movies he directed this the sequel witches of eastwick he did all that and,0.36218753
he was able to pay his dues come full circle just like we're coming back,0.07580402
to him in this review and finally take his place as his rightful place obviously,0.22353396
based on this film as one of the great filmmakers of all time it's just,0.10295276
such a wonder to behold and it's just it's like seeing a butterfly emerge from,0.08086109
