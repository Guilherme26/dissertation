now all the kids in the cast's are real middle schoolers and I really enjoyed that because a lot of times was nice to see these type of films and say hey wait a minute that person who looked like they 13 they look like 21 and look like they're happy to have this role there are all middle schoolers and I really enjoy these young actors because you can see there's a vast difference between a 16 year old and a 13 year old because again Kayla had a session where she went to a high school and she had the buddy up with a high schooler and you can see the difference in their ages their discussions and things like that I like that but this is focusing on Kayla's life other actors in this film too is Daniel's O'Hara as Riley Frank dill as officer Todd and Greg Crowe as principal McDaniels,0.08873405
