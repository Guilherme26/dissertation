I'm gonna give this one three books there were some really good Oscar furnaces but there were some movements where the actors were breaking character but just me and that was usually when they I could tell it they were about to laugh and I so I got they were doing making the film but it took me a little bit out of the film I think Kaitlyn Dever was the strongest performer of all of them,0.07923469
and she very much committed to the role,0.07319439
and just was honest she never felt forced to me no one galvan also stole the show he is a minor role in this but he was amazing and great and stole my heart for diversity in front of him behind the camera I'm gonna give this one three books it was written and directed by woman guys fully woman like thrusted and I love that we love that,0.20744208
