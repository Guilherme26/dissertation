the Irishman is directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Robert DeNiro Joe Pesci and Al,0.02200361
Pacino and follows the life of Frank Sheeran a truck driver who may or may,0.06680905
not have had some involvement with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa I was really excited,0.030279825
for this movie purely and simply because it is directed by Martin Scorsese now I,0.03391106
don't have to explain myself on that one because the guy is a genius when,0.04748746
it comes to filmmaking and throughout his entire career he's never made at least in,0.0627328
my personal opinion he is yet to make a single bad film every movie he's,0.10146445
made has been good if not great and the best thing about his career is,0.04340789
that even though some of his movies may be structurally or stylistically a little bit,0.070657134
similar every movie he makes is pretty much completely different from the last for example,0.031796444
Hugo is completely different to silence the wolf of Wall Street is completely different to,0.041680407
Goodfellas and the Irishman is another one of those movies in his career it feels,0.041414335
very familiar yet has enough different things going on that it kind of stands as,0.009303924
its own unique thing that he is yet to pull off in his career and,0.034020152
I've got to say the Irishman is yet another great film to add to his,0.029878054
filmography because I enjoyed every single minute of this movie and that's saying something especially,0.049711835
considering how long dismay V is but I'll get onto that in a little bit,0.06388623
first up I have to talk about the performances everyone in this movie brings their,0.01655376
a game and that's saying something considering you have pretty much a shitload of a-listers,0.45570335
in this film you've got Robert De Niro playing Frank Sheeran and he's really really,0.060447898
good in this movie he does a lot he conveys a lot of emotion in,0.04235956
this movie just through his facial expression or the way he looks because usually nowadays,0.1495446
in film you're used to someone kind of telling you how they feel whereas in,0.054738626
this movie there's a lot of just distant or blank expressions that are left open,0.028282944
for interpretation in terms of how he is feeling and there are a lotta scenes,0.022189861
where you're just solely relying on the look that Robert De Niro is giving on,0.02377566
his face to pretty much explain how he is feeling in said scenes and I,0.093834795
think it works really well here that and also the fact that any scene that,0.01903955
he is in with Joe Pesci who plays Russell is absolutely brilliant and it's really,0.045779932
nice to see Joe Pesci in a movie like this again because he is /,0.10116313
as far as I'm aware he came out of retirement just to be in this,0.020251516
movie and I haven't seen him in a film since well Homeline - all the,0.017834904
good old Goodfellas and it's really nice to see him doing what he does best,0.070039846
again because I've kind of missed him being in films but no Joe Pesci brings,0.0576202
his a-game to this film and he really is so good in this movie that,0.09353014
he's one of those characters where if you're on his good side you he's a,0.0280182
really likable character but then if you get just ever so slightly on his bad,0.034117933
side he could completely your life up and that switch between the two is really,0.034649417
noticeable in this movie and I loved everything he did with that performance Al Pacino,0.07668769
is also really great in this movie as he plays Jimmy Hoffa and I thought,0.020492978
he was fantastic in almost every single scene he was in and I'm quite surprised,0.04323627
to find out that this is his first collaboration with Scorsese you would think over,0.041152917
the many years both of them have been working you would have thought at some,0.017356636
point they would have worked together but apparently this is the first time they have,0.019769924
worked on a project together and it shows because they really do work so well,0.028992694
together when put in the right project and Al Pacino makes every moment last in,0.025962783
this film especially the moments where he's able to kind of go full-on and really,0.03895515
over exaggerate certain things and just go really over-the-top in his performance and I love,0.029971179
it when he does that in movies if you've seen heat you'll know exactly what,0.022824446
I'm on about she got great ass and you got your hair all the way,0.57981527
up but yeah he was fantastic in this movie and also a lot of the,0.036631662
supporting cast were great as well and as an avid follower of Martin Scorsese's projects,0.0494278
throughout the years it's really nice to see a lot of actors from his TV,0.030426165
oriented projects such as Broadwalk Empire or vinyl it's nice to see a lot of,0.051837098
those actors crop up in this movie such as Ray Romano Bobby Cannavale and of,0.10969743
course Steven Graham Steven Graham is one of the most underrated actors working today I'm,0.021166809
just saying every performance I see of him is like better than the last one,0.036719467
I'm not saying something considering that every performance he gives is absolutely fantastic but yeah,0.0281978
he really does deliver in this movie and everyone delivers I suppose my only nitpick,0.05774659
when it comes to performances or screen time in that sense is the Anna Paquin,0.025251701
who plays an older version of Robert Nero's daughter doesn't get that much screen time,0.017600095
and I wouldn't really care that much if it wasn't such an integral arc in,0.023031984
the emotional personality of Robert De Niro's character is such an important emotional arc for,0.008175773
his character yet you don't really see much of her character therefore that arc kind,0.041895926
of feels a little bit a little bit empty in my opinion I do think,0.28591672
the point of it is conveyed by the end of the film but I just,0.015057762
would have liked one or two more scenes with her character just to fully to,0.015965737
make that arc fully realized in its best form oh and in regards to the,0.030851217
de-aging stuff that they do for the actors yeah it's a little bit noticeable at,0.07296666
first but after a couple of things you just kind of get used to it,0.03931036
and it's actually really bloody impressive there's a lot of shots where Joe Pesci looks,0.22794248
like a young Joe Pesci or De Niro looks like really De Niro and it's,0.068895064
just really impressive especially with some of the scenes and how they play out and,0.02508075
how technically intricate they are especially in regards to how well they're shot the fact,0.083946176
that they're able to make that D aging thing look as convincing as it is,0.016821165
amongst these intricate looking like long takes is really impressive now the one thing that,0.019293651
people are talking about the most about this movie is the runtime is three and,0.034280904
a half hours long and yes that can seem very daunting at first but I've,0.03856868
got to be honest even though there are times in the film where you can,0.026832178
kind of feel that three hour runtime kick in I was thoroughly fascinated and engaged,0.17016795
throughout the entire thing and that's also even more saying something considering that a lot,0.018430244
of the movie is just people talking yes you do have scenes of violence and,0.10097954
you know some really tense scenes especially towards the end but the majority of the,0.029005334
movie is just people sitting down and talking to each other or just a lot,0.077634245
of montages explaining how certain things got from point A to point B and it's,0.019497197
pretty much Scorsese doing what he did in Goodfellas but a lot more refined and,0.057111338
restrained to the point where it feels more polished than Goodfellas in a sense if,0.046398554
you've seen the movie you kind of know I mean but it kind of feels,0.09226297
a lot more you know focused and restrained than Goodfellas water was and I really,0.02273398
did appreciate that about this movie which kept me engaged throughout it's three and a,0.025375426
half hour long runtime also is entertaining as the Mafia related stuff is in this,0.03902566
movie I actually found one of the more interesting and more powerful moments to come,0.015742902
actually right at the end of the movie when you see Frank as an old,0.04722405
man I don't say anything else if you haven't seen the film but I just,0.017217614
thought it really really worked for me and the emotional resonance of that scene specifically,0.027025746
the one of the last shots of the film really hits home and kind of,0.04293561
ends up delivering a completely different theme and message then maybe what was conveyed at,0.017147103
the start of the movie because at the start of the film you kind of,0.04427063
think okay I'm kind of going into my regular Scorsese cliches here but then by,0.085563906
the end of the film school says he delivers you a completely new message and,0.020372579
it really does hit if you know exactly what you're looking for in the end,0.059872515
the Irishman is a thoroughly entertaining movie that can feel a tad slow at times,0.0811238
but never completely drags the movie down because of it but no it is a,0.013972848
thoroughly entertaining movie with fantastic performances I suppose if I had to nitpick in the,0.07698769
movie I would say that the passage of time in certain bits towards the start,0.042173974
of the film is a little unclear because you're kind it will kind of cut,0.051863037
from one scene to another and you're not sure whether you're still in the same,0.019593649
time period or whether they've jumped forwards or backwards in time it gets a little,0.042515878
bit clearer the more the movie goes on to come because it kind of sticks,0.09032196
in a certain time period of Frank's life for a long period of time and,0.033128142
then will then cut to the next and then cut to the next but in,0.108226046
those first few scenes it's a little bit unclear because it just bounces back and,0.11379762
forth all the time and you're a little bit unsure how old he's supposed to,0.12321596
be or how far or how early in these people's lives we are currently in,0.055368558
because there's no indication of it and it just kind of feels a little unclear,0.02587764
at first but like I said it does get a lot clearer the more the,0.030047676
movie goes on and apart from that though I will happily give the Irishman an,0.051409382
8.5 out of 10 this is definitely proof that Scorsese still knows what he's doing,0.03384255
and he's just a master of his craft at this point he's yet to make,0.05121781
a bad movie and the Irishman is proof that he can still make fantastic films,0.09815384
so guys that was my review for the Irishman I hope you enjoyed it if,0.12100688
