Mad Max fury road I normally reserved like movie reviews for my tech Channel but,0.15144071
today is something special in a history of Australian cinema there's very few movies that,0.07380567
are as iconic as Mad Max Mad Max 2 was probably considered one of the,0.15492228
most epic a pop apocalyptic car action movies of possibly all-time and it definitely set,0.0964514
a style and a theme that people have tried to replicate in the past for,0.058470532
me I'm gonna be very very biased because of what you Mad Max - so,0.36663452
many times as a child growing up and as an adult and it would rage,0.31089434
probably one of my all-time favorite movies along comes Mad Max for fury road with,0.1935761
Mad Max 3 didn't live up to the expectations as it would hardly be able,0.17523442
to of Mad Max 2 and so here we come - Mad Max fury road,0.1036525
so I saw some of like their previews and some of the pictures and to,0.09497605
me the vehicles looked sort of over-the-top and I didn't really have any excitement or,0.029322367
really a great interest to watch it I kind of thought it might have been,0.044038042
a little bit of a letdown but the movie come and had a look on,0.18757632
Internet Movie Database and everyone's given it on 8 9 10 out of 10 I,0.11909674
thought wow it must be okay and then a movie reviewer and Australia gave it,0.13752949
a 5 out of 5 and I thought maybe there's Thompson about this maybe that's,0.06588318
worth going to check out and so I went to the cinemas to support the,0.0668673
the creation of the movie into and to basically show my interest and support for,0.045783028
the movie and man I was belonging the way so let me just give you,0.082081616
like an insight into Mad Max Mad Max was played by Mel Gibson and there's,0.16326523
no possible way that another actor could capture the the heart and the soul of,0.11270061
the character that was Mad Max it was created by Mel Gibson this is not,0.1485904
going to happen and so the first part of the movie that you know he's,0.09193348
going to sort of cause the problem is Mel Gibson is not in it no,0.0955719
matter what your opinion of Mel Gibson is Mel Gibson created the character Mad Max,0.25292066
and he did a really really good job and that was sort of like he's,0.07909039
sort of early days acting so forget about whatever your views are on well Gibson,0.14747976
Mel Gibson is a good actor and Mad Max Mel Gibson isn't Mad Max and,0.24207999
so well just forget about the character of Mad Max at the moment and we'll,0.09087837
just focus on on the theme and the heart of Mad Max it's an apocalyptic,0.20392361
world where gasoline is the most valuable substance that there is water seems to hold,0.06579306
a little value and food you don't even hear about except in dog food Mad,0.31089434
Max 2 and and and so pretty much straight away they've that managed to capture,0.1923056
the heart of what Mad Max 2 was where you know you had your vehicle,0.17966002
and your vehicle was was the life you know it was the thing that got,0.09483426
you from A to B but you're out of trouble and basically it was a,0.33210194
life and so Mad Max and his vehicle was a key part of of the,0.23673433
movie and the truck the truck being such a menacing vehicle is another key area,0.06203622
of the movie and so the movie starts off with Mad Max and it's a,0.12880081
little bit of a letdown at the beginning for me so Tom Hardy plays Mad,0.35037643
Max and there's no point trying to compare him to the original Mad Max so,0.15494235
George Miller the director of the original one has come back for this movie and,0.081893265
uh I don't think anyone else could have done it except him and so the,0.11747945
Tartan Mad Max and he's sort of character role it sort of pushed to the,0.23906827
side and I think that was a really smart move and that the focus of,0.055854954
the character of the movie was pushed more into Charlie's Theron and I quite a,0.0490442
fan of her and let me just start by saying that the way that her,0.09288897
character come onto the screen with something that was missing I'm trying to give away,0.09360922
spoilers with this set her character up for an immediate development and immediate interest and,0.10616234
not feeling sorry for her but wanting to kind of learn more so they put,0.17996176
more character development on to her character which i think was a really really smart,0.11110295
move so now we're going to get Tom Hardy so Tom Hardy did a good,0.0766816
job I thought you know I tried to forget about the comparisons and I I,0.06412813
think he did a good job as as a as Mad Max not a great,0.3781563
job but it's impossible for him to do that it's just not gonna happen so,0.07955876
you know he did the best job that he could Charlie Theron was the standout,0.05780595
of the movie but she was designed to be the standout of the I'm sorry,0.09779447
sorry sorry she was not the standout of the movie the movie is based around,0.14256105
the vehicles the apocalyptic environment that said that that question of thirst for gasoline and,0.051381905
you know that's sort of what drives you on so I think the movie lost,0.22550102
its passion and drive for gasoline and the focus was instead on on people and,0.10724553
I guess that's just the direction that they wanted to go on an amazing but,0.03650931
Mad Max is about the vehicles the apocalyptic environment and the ride and they captured,0.09368652
their heart of Mad Max and the the driving and an action they captured it,0.11683097
to a tee it was it was cinematic perfection with cars you know it's kind,0.09935079
of like a car chase but the way that they portrayed it in the action,0.054580443
and the vehicles like when I saw the vehicles on screen when you saw them,0.04333281
all together that over-the-top appearance of them was sort of merged into just awesomeness you,0.08092805
know just spectacular almost like military precision of an attack formation of row grade you,0.34709287
know in an apocalyptic environment sorry and so you know the the movie is based,0.09545571
around the chase and the taste is like almost to our events and they somehow,0.07858451
managed to sort of have the action you know it's dark like I sort of,0.08521702
started a little bit I know so I'll let you down a little bit and,0.4032845
you've got a little bit of character development and the characters that they used in,0.090825856
the movie were some of the old characters in the original movies which I thought,0.04804285
was really good and you know they had the bad guy and they definitely captured,0.17261703
sort of what I think they tried to capture in Mad Max 3 but they,0.09892185
did it quite well in this movie of the of the people in the environment,0.15412818
and then the character developed come up and then you know a little bit of,0.096617766
action and started to come on and then it sort of just ramped up and,0.09311121
actually just kept ramping up and ramping up and ramping up and then you've got,0.07311674
like a little bit of a while with a little bit of more character development,0.22387771
and then back in some more action and then kind of it flowed I thought,0.063079625
quite well to the point where you know it's a good movie where you lose,0.11796962
sense of time and you sort of get really wrapped up into the movie itself,0.167544
so I had like accent a little bit of character development action partes great cinematography,0.08275284
great car stunts the cars themselves were they were over the top but it that,0.07798112
was kind of like the essence of Mad Max you know the whole world was,0.1510857
based around gasoline and your vehicle and so it was it was over-the-top but it,0.07735803
yeah it created that sense of of the of the world in the environment and,0.06079247
the sort of desperation that it was that the characters and white dark I loved,0.04806939
a little bit strange and very strange to hear them talk in a very casual,0.24803403
almost an Australian style accent so that was a little bit of a sort of,0.097169116
a little bit of us how off but it was it worked fine to anthem,0.07335458
ad so I'm giving the movie ten out of ten because I'm completely biased and,0.13424785
yep and so basically Mad Max is like the iconic Australian movie and um I'm,0.13759193
hoping that you will support the movie cinemas and the directors and the actors and,0.077169955
go see this movie on the big screen it's an action movie involving cars that,0.06239031
you will very rarely come across Mad Max 2 was really really good but this,0.29794085
was this was the spectacular in its action and so you know they didn't I,0.039413564
guess the focus wasn't really on Mad Max it was more on ferocious you Charlie's,0.18803436
there on his character and the cast himself because the movie just you just can't,0.08623195
do a Mad Max movie without Bob Gibson and so they shifted the focus a,0.115303084
little bit off of that to balance it out I guess and so the movie,0.16055542
was very very well balanced in Tom Hardy you did a great job and I,0.06026447
was quite happy with the performance and yeah so I firmly just seen this on,0.061308954
the big screen 3d I don't think is necessary but if you want what's in,0.07590672
3d and it's available in 3d you go for it yeah Dmitry's one of Dimitri,0.08214645
