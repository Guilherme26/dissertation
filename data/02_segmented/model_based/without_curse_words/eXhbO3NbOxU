"What our peeps, Tony Baker here back for another movie review? This time I'm reviewing The Black Plans me old cake cake cake, classic Black clansmen, I don't even know how to say it"
I've never said it out loud
"Black pit cake, click, clansmen, Black cuckoo-land sound like I'm still doing, But you know what I mean, Black cake, a clamp"
I don't know
"It's a new Spike Lee joint man, and the best Spike Lee joint I've seen in a long time"
"Probably the best Spike Lee joint since the inside man, but the inside man didn't really feel like a Spike Lee joint"
but it was inspired to be joint
but it didn't
It didn't fall into the Spike Lee joint mold
This is right up Spike Lee's alley right here
"the subject matter, the tone, this is right up his alley"
It was good to see him back back in form and you don't there and shout out his documentary
"He's done some great documentaries, but like a movie with the with the attention of the people in his style of director, it's good to see him back"
man
"Anyway, the story's about"
"It's based on a true story, which I didn't know about until the movie came out about a black cop who infiltrated the Kkk"
"I was like what, a Colorado Springs police officer infiltrated the Kkk via telephone conversations"
Then he had another cop go in That poses him
"Infiltrated the Kkk I was like, Wow, I thought they made it up for for a film"
"You know, I thought it was just a Chappelle's Show sketch, And then they expanded it on that, But no life is stranger than fiction, Man, I was like Wow, that's pretty dope"
"The movie stars John David Washington, and you got Alec Baldwin in there"
"You got Topher, Gracie"
You have Adam Driver and the girl from Spider-man Homecoming Because I was trying to figure out the whole time because she had an afro
I was like
this girl looks so familiar
I was looking at the whole town
I can't wait to get on Imdb When this movie is over
That's what I love about Imdb
You can just go straight to
There's no back in the day
I grew up in the 80s
There was no Imdb
You had to really be like
"I know that face from somewhere, but you don't even know the name"
"so, even even when the cast rolls at the end you don't even know who you're looking for"
We love crap
"I see the name, but there's nothing"
What else were they in? But now I am Db
"highlight, Paul Walter Hauser, who played in the He played An eye, Tiniest Shine, Eckhart, he played in that movie Man, He killed me in Italian, He killed me again"
In this man
the way he plays his characters is hilarious
"And this movie man, there's a lot of funny stuff in this movie"
It's not like a
It's not like a
You know serious
Are we gonna be serious and stressed and pissed off? the whole movie? It's like a lot of moments of comedy in this movie and a lot of hard-hitting moments too
"And like you know, you really, just take it in and it's just cool the see"
"and like these characters the characters they create it, They felt really like, lived in and creeping like you find yourself like even the Kkk members"
You find yourself like this guy right here is not that bad
even though he's in the Kkk
I could deal with him right here
"This guy's just No, but this guy kind of cool, laid-back kind of like his attitude, even though he hates people like me, did bad if a guy"
"that's when you know you've created like good characters, like when you could still find a nugget of humanity in there, and like you know, there was a wife of one of the Kkk members who did a good job - she was like this happy homemaker type, but she was really just racist as hell, but it was just good to see, but had the sweetest face"
I'm the old guy
"All this ugliness coming out of this didn't see that coming, but you see it coming because she's married to a die-hard Klansmen"
"Seen women to die hard out here, Man when they believe in something off"
Man it worse in the men
Those dynamics were really good in this picture Like there was a moment in the movie where they were like dancing and like A at a party
And you know this is seventies
So the music was right
They had the afro was gone
I found myself smiling at the scene like I want to be there
"Yeah, I told my girlfriend I was like I wanted to be at that party"
You know this
She just looked at me like
"what, Don't judge me out here"
The performance would be good man
It was just a good flow
"Occasionally, I would like drift off and kind of be like"
Where are they going right now? Like they were there with definitely moments
Do the editing
"and like you know, those type of choices where I was"
just like where we're going now
"Okay, all right, that's cool"
That's cool
"Why we? Why do we go there this way? Spike? All right, So I definitely had moments of that"
"This movie is not flawless, but it was a good watch, and the last"
the final ending moments in the movie were very powerful
I'm not gonna say what happened
I'm not gonna tell you
Just gonna have to see it for yourself
What did? It was just silent
It was very powerful man
My girl was like
I almost folded
That was like this
This movie is right on time
This is the one-year anniversary
"You know, the stuff that went on in Virginia with the tiki torches"
"Neither I say anymore, And so it's very timely"
"This is very on the button issues, so it really resonates and that's one of the takeaways, man"
The timeliness of it
"Another takeaway is man, Denzel Sun"
he has the future man
"Like you know, he plays on the Hbo series Ballers, And like this is the first time I seen him in the film"
I probably seen him in other films
Didn't even know it was him
and he has a future man is just like his pops
He did a good job
I was listening to see if he sounded like Denzel
If he moved like I thought I heard pockets was like Yo
"He sounded like busy right there, but I don't know if I'm overlooking"
Like says I know who his dad is
I'm like
"Oh, that was it"
"is it? I think I heard a little bit in it, but if I didn't know who he was what I had heard, then Zero"
probably not
probably not
"He's his old man, I'm saying, but I was definitely looking and listening"
Definitely doing that
This is easily the best Spike Lee movie in a long time
Does it live up to the hype? It's a good movie
It's a good movie
Is the great table's great
"I say it's good, though very timely, but you know it didn't"
It didn't blow my socks off
"It didn't make my team shatter, but it is definitely definitely better than Chiraq, Chiraq, that Spike Lee joint right there pissed me off"
"It's not just because I'm from Chicago, but it might be because up from Chicago, I just didn't like how it was done"
I was like this is
"I really didn't like Chiraq at all, So this is a big"
It's a big improvement
It was Spike Lee's last movie
But forget all that man
"Y'all want to know the smooth jazz review of Black clansmen Well, here it is"
Oh yeah
I'm giving Black clansmen three and a half saxophone side of the five
"I'm gonna be called a de clan and see if they can, Uh, tell it"
I'm black
"Alright, Peeps, That's my review of Black Klansmen"
Let me know what you thought about the movie In the comment section below
"Are you excited about it? Have you seen it? What do you think about? I would bring up other movies in the same vein, but I honestly couldn't think of anything based on the true story, So it's not a lot of movies to compare it to"
"I was gonna say, American History X with non-us That's different, and like you know, get out, but no, that's That's different as well"
So this is just its own movie night
