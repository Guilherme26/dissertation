the year so far so the favor is directed by your grasslands emails and stars,0.060700413
and the stone as Abigail who arrived at a palace in England to work for,0.079033494
Queen Anne however when she arrives there she is competing against her cousin Lady Sarah,0.17400481
to be the Queen's favorite first off I'd like to talk about Olivia Colman in,0.12580115
this movie as Queen and giving an oscar-worthy performance here she is brilliant in this,0.22456212
movie I'm a big fan of Olivia comb and I've been a big fan of,0.24874237
her back you know Peep Show days I love Olivia Colman I think she's absolutely,0.26261088
brilliant I think she's so funny and she's great in this film as Queen and,0.11963855
very over-the-top very over exuberant but very very appropriate and also very very funny she's,0.09273007
great in this film and like I say potentially oscar-worthy I'd love to see the,0.07497336
Oscars give her Biff attention I've seen she has been getting some you know award,0.1493615
season buzz from other shows so I'm really hoping that for the Oscars they do,0.046411004
give us a recognition because Olivia Colman is excellent in this movie also Emma Stone,0.12058637
as abigail is as delightful as always a very innocent performance from Emma Stone for,0.10403601
the most part and she's very good here too of the Emma Stone you don't,0.106033176
need to say she's good in a movie of course she's good in this movie,0.18465537
and she was absolutely mesmerizing I really enjoyed a lot of her scenes she was,0.24121648
very funny in this movie else we know Emma Stone is very very funny too,0.078435935
and she gets to put that on a full display here in the favorite my,0.069960795
favorite performance in this movie though has to go to Rachel Weisz as Lady Sarah,0.10042515
it's always a treasure when we get to see Rachel Weisz in a film and,0.055633582
she is fantastic in this movie as well very very devilish and I enjoyed that,0.49537134
a lot she has a lot going on behind her eyes she is a very,0.10205894
duplicitous very almost evil character at times and I really enjoyed her performance and it,0.4121162
seemed like Rachel Weisz was having a lot of fun playing this role which I,0.05767308
really appreciate for me like if I can see an actor on screen having a,0.103093766
good time in their role it makes it reflects a lot better on me and,0.10479173
for me I could completely see Rachel vice just completely relishing in this devilish role,0.488389
and I thought was fantastic also I really had to praise the direction in this,0.057155054
film Yoko slanty must did a fantastic job directing this film it's really well handled,0.12739
that the camerawork it's really sleek and smooth and almost modern in a sense which,0.056187168
is weird given that this film takes place in the 18th century but seeing that,0.09810694
you can actually see the camerawork done so well in this movie just makes it,0.061625477
that much more cat eating that much better to follow as the camerawork is that,0.09036523
well handled by your Assad's Hamas and of course this film does have a excellent,0.090347424
script now all your ghost lands must didn't write this movie he still could you,0.2530778
can still see elements of his extremely witty humor coming through in this this script,0.099159
in this movie is so sharp and it's just really funny at times this movie,0.115941465
is well it's partly a drama it is also partly a comedy I say it's,0.085167386
in more parts a comedy but not a traditional comedy like you know your typical,0.2666782
kind of American style film instead this is a lot more focus on more situational,0.039379906
humor and dialogue and character interactions and it's a lot more funny in that way,0.11548615
I think the natural humor that comes out of this movie works really well in,0.10485579
its favor because especially with a movie like this you know on paper especially when,0.19380917
you look at it in concept you wouldn't really expect it to be a funny,0.09682467
movie but when this is as funny as it is I think it's really impressive,0.08206224
and they say I was laughing so much throughout this film I think they're so,0.0690617
good dialogue especially the interaction between Emma Stone and Joe Allen's character it's really nicely,0.051316746
Joe Alwyn in this movie too but the interaction between them two is really hilarious,0.10549591
and again just seeing the competing nature between Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz and as,0.053846836
high as it gets by the end of this film it's fantastic and even wild,0.18281753
by the end of the film especially with Emma Stone's character when you get to,0.033656064
the end of her arc it does have a bit of a sad undertone to,0.1730926
it the movie still has a really good plentiful amount of jokes in it that,0.07110561
will have you laughing throughout my only negative with the favorite is that I feel,0.15258352
like it's a bit slow and a bit tedious at times and I think that,0.4338699
mostly comes down to the pacing I feel like the pacing in this film is,0.07037076
a little bit sluggish it can feel like it's dragging on a bit I feel,0.1419214
like 10 minutes of the movie probably could have been shaved off and I feel,0.1121372
like the movie does drag on a little bit with certain things but for the,0.06755399
most part it's okay and I think the first half is a lot less suffering,0.23800606
of this than the second half but the pacing is my only negative it was,0.094085805
anything that really stood out to me is like sometimes the movie did come across,0.06133941
as a little bit tedious and you were kind of thinking to yourself yeah we,0.5351302
can move this on a little bit overall I really enjoyed the favorite I thought,0.21305107
this movie was absolutely outstanding I loved pretty much all of it like I say,0.1181217

personal favor I loved her Emma Stone and of course Rachel Weisz who probably gives,0.11731167
the best performance in the film I think they were all excellent and smoother performances,0.052175492
as well I Nicholas Hoult is really good in this movie so Joe Alwyn like,0.05093584

was and I just really enjoyed all the elements even though the pacing was a,0.072430745
