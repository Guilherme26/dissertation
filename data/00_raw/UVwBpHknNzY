[Music] well Conda forever what is happening magnesite hmm so just got back from seeing the Black Panther and I have to say that I am thoroughly satisfied with what they did with this movie this movie takes place during civil war because his father is dead at this point we all know this it's not a spoiler but as you know his coordination of becoming King you know there's that in everything that transpires so it's it's right in that timeframe right there okay I'm gonna let you know that there are two post-credit scenes and now let's get into the movie so follows T'Challa after his father is killed and him becoming the king of Wakanda but then he is challenged by Michael B Jordan for some reason or the other and Michael B Jordan is our main criminal but Andy Serkis plays Klaw and he is also a villain and he plays it was really nice to see Andy Serkis enya a real Andy Serkis an on CGI sir-sir because it was interesting to watch him act as himself already know he's a great actor but it was nice to see unless himself and you did a great job I don't know where to start the special effects were top-notch there were scenes where it was like is kind of a CGI fest but nothing more than you might not see in certain other movies yeah I mean they did not show us as some dancing in the grass you know dirt Hut people it was off the chain what Condon's were very technologically advanced and powerful people many tribes there and I got to say the music was done very well throughout the movie my main gripe although I said was a small break when I first saw the first trailer first big trailer that came out so I was like what's with all the rap this is taking place in Africa I understated think I thought the rap was out of place the music was good for the trailer I just didn't think that the ramp even though I heard what the rap words said I just didn't think it fit for this African story I must tell you the music was very powerful and ethnic all throughout there were a couple of rat joints but they were placed very well where they were needed where it made sense to have it sometime use people at all types of African garb all type of different the African cultures and the markings and the clothing and it was so [ __ ] cool just to see all these black actors together in this Seville movie like this I'm telling you it was powerful for me as African American it was powerful to see this it really felt good from my point of view to see this unfold in front of me okay Michonne might have been the most badass song [ __ ] in the movie I'm not joking when I [ __ ] tell you this I was like a little more badasses to chose it up it is a Michelle I forgot her name meaning y'all know I go by who I remember you by the most you know so you know I called Black Panther Black Panther yeah I'm saying that's who he is me Black Panther I know he's played all the roles black man that me and Michelle Michonne to me that's just how it is the actually the fight scenes were good the fight scenes were good man Black Panther was kicking ass and I got to tell you man it was like it's funny that you know as the technologically advanced they are there were a lot of ancient ceremonies and things going throughout but they were interwoven into why they did what they did and Black Panther definitely had some challenges in this movie he wasn't let's let's just say he had some challenges one big challenge and I was surprised I was very surprised I got to tell you Michael B Jordan as the villain the main villain was a sympathetic villain like you kind of like Oh that God changes something hmm hmm okay I see why you doing what you doing I got you I got you but uh I gotta tell you what's cool man it was really cool watching that movie I might actually go see it again that's not solved in 3d 3d was done well but personally me it wasn't me it wasn't like this extraordinary avatar thing 3d stuff now it wasn't even me it was just maybe when I buy it on blu-ray I'll get it in three days just cuz I got 3d TV I might as well use it young-sam I loved his sister a love to childhood sister she was so funny she did a great job she was the chick that was in the black Museum of black mirror I loved him that who really stood out to me the characters that stood out to me the most or T'Challa of course his sister Michonne killing his usual my favorite [ __ ] characters in the movie I'm serious like I don't know I like berm or her or Black Panther and I'm joking Michael B Jordan is kill monger [ __ ] killed in Andy Serkis those are my favorite right there those are my favorite everything that everybody else did a great job too they did there are some twists in terms of the movie that you're not gonna expect the way this story goes which kind of links into the veil things like that always shipped in and there's some political things in their ideas thought well good [ __ ] in there so I'm gonna recommend that you all go see this movie I'm gonna give this 4 out of 5 boos for our the black panther post comments down below let me know what you all thought I'm sure I've left some things out but even if I did so what [ __ ] comments down below let me know what you liked the most if you don't want it spoiled don't look in the comment section you know because you know people wouldn't be talking thoroughly subscribers [Music] [Music]
