A 24 just keeps on coming
Let's jump into it
"You F grade is a comedy-drama film directed and written by Bo Burnham, in his first feature film directorial debut, stars Elsie Fisher, Josh Hamilton, Emily Roberson, and basically here is that we followed the life and struggles of an 8th grader 13 year-old Kayla, Kayla, turning her last week of classes beat of middle school before embarking on to high school, and she makes her way through this last week and the end of thus far her disastrous 8th grade year, and she also struggles with anxiety in social situations, but produces video blogs giving life advice"
8th grade was a great film
I wasn't sure whether or not to believe people on the prairies That does movie was Guinea
"I wasn't sure if this if to believe him not, but they knew what they're talking about and I decided to give in and give it a chance"
"Ok and I, I enjoyed the film"
For what it was
It was entertaining
It was fine
It's enjoyable and it was a great film
The Afternoons movie was really great from everyone
"But even on the the, The young Kid who played Um, you could play the Kayla, Josh Hamilton is the dad"
He was worried and the rest of the cast was very good
I liked the directing handwriting here by Bo Burnham
I think he wrote
He
"He drew off his own influences of anxiety when he was writing the script back in 2014, and the that I love the things that they go through they use in this movie With the heavy use of social media, mental health and generations, the concerns in sexuality"
"Now that has gotten controversy, which blocked many eighth graders from seeing the film, But the distributions the free screenings across Ford in the Us"
for those eighth graders who couldn't see it and I have to applaud the Are reading
I do love deer
The Are rating does or help the film
Of course it doesn't
I don't mind the fact that this is an r-rated film
"Yes, is gonna keep some 8th graders from watching"
But but they
"but hey, what can you do? It's just how people are now"
The music here is is really good
The music here is great
I do like the dramatic moments
You get some great humor and some good
Some good
"Most, no scenes here and I'm not going to spoil anything"
I'm not gonna give anything away
But I just think that this was this was a good
This was a good one and it was great
"So the kudos to the director and writer for doing this for the for that, Because this, that, because this was great and I have no complaints with this movie whatsoever"
"Overall, I am recommending you watch it great"
now
"of course, some eighth graders are not going to be able to watch this because it is all radiant, but it's a great movie and I'm gonna say, See it and I will give this my Jd rainbows sill of approval"
