so I've watched the farewell I feel about an asian-american who finds out her grandmother,0.27669573
is dying so her family all gather in China to say goodbye however the grandmother,0.08675591
doesn't even know and instead thinks that they're all coming for her grandson's wedding this,0.030676274
is Lulu Wong's first major film and it's based on her own life and relationship,0.040611457
with her grandmother the strongest aspects of this film are the performances and the writing,0.046597444
the soundtrack and visuals are also rather good consistent and quite memorable this review is,0.0071267774
not going to be as structured as I'd like so I'm just going to talk,0.03311883
about it in some supose convoluted way but I should say warning that there are,0.19596443
spoilers ahead if you haven't already seen it if you're in the UK you can,0.045406766
see it on Google or YouTube right now so please do aquafina who plays the,0.061988465
lead character Billy has this utterly perfect expression all the time some actors could easily,0.04387551
do the typical actus thing where they pretend to be sad where they talk slowly,0.06472636
sigh you know laughs weakly to that thing what that it's like to me it's,0.07176999
just really obvious and it's obvious that they're acting and it distracts me but Aquafina,0.03975071
is very believable she is quite an endearing approach she doesn't try to hide her,0.061788242
sadness though her ninite doesn't even see how depressed she is just just totally he,0.073282614
current of how she feels the performance is over all are very naturalistic and I,0.044379722
thought everyone did a good job there are a lot of scenes of eating in,0.045114085
this film food is a huge part of Chinese culture and a classic dinner scene,0.0722436
is a cinema essential making these scenes particularly warming and filled with dramatic tension very,0.06673588
little is said explicitly but it's like the whole bomb under the table situation everyone,0.121990025
knows there's something wrong but no one's saying anything or doing anything for fear no,0.014338698
no finding out I like how Aquafina is trying her best to speak Mandarin in,0.03244367
the film this is an experience that I've been through many times you know she,0.01854399
tries to guess the tones of the language and she gets corrected but at least,0.021049071
she tries also the hotel scene in it it's basically their flip reverse of what,0.061111752
it feels like to look Asian in Europe you get are still are these questions,0.067670465
like do you feel more British or Chinese it's their these from my perspective it's,0.076668404
just so bizarre that people would think that I who lived in Hong Kong for,0.0683709
just one year of my life and then lived here nearly thirty years of my,0.039625656
life like don't speak Chinese I hold a British passport you'd think I would feel,0.14293
more British than Chinese but it's nice at least they show an interest I guess,0.08134398
there's a lot of shots with negative space no doubt it's meant to create some,0.111672364
sense of sadness and loneliness and well the film is really good at delivering on,0.019780567
that it's so hard to explain just how much of a merit is to watch,0.0322348
this film for me I mean anyone that's gone through loss will feel the same,0.107713856
anyone that's ever tried to pretend to be okay so as not to upset someone,0.08263577
else will feel the same while I was looking forward to this film I I,0.052294742
didn't anticipate how much it would dredge up inside of me and consequently I found,0.057433285
myself crying hysterically while watching this film I was just I wasn't able to watch,0.11662199
it without relating it to the loss of my own grandmother to top it all,0.032391116
off when I first watched it I was with my friend he bless him he'd,0.03564187
experienced the same loss very recently so we both lost our grandma and we were,0.022511145
watching this film I just spent most of the time apologizing to him I'm sorry,0.039179318
Mike I'm sorry the writer director Lily Wong takes time to show B Lee and,0.042682838
her nice relationship it was doing these scenes I found myself tearing up the most,0.08982174
I really don't think it's possible to watch this film entirely objectively unless you've never,0.056124207
experienced loss of a grandparent I simply found myself constantly projecting it made the experience,0.031068733
both while cathartic extremely difficult the fact that this film is labeled as a comedy,0.0875395
is the real joke cause jokes in this I kind of the sort of sad,0.047068395
attempts that Outsiders make to try to cheer you up during a tragic moment in,0.025954802
your life and like you laughs weakly but it does nothing to help that being,0.11745347
said the film is successful at balancing tragedy or comedy it manages to be considerably,0.018400975
humorous despite all the characters being so sad I guess the right word for this,0.020844195
is absurdist you're laughing at the situation not how sad they are the cinematography I,0.07701762
struggled with to begin with I was struggling to understand the need for so much,0.017758409
negative space as I was saying but you know it's unique in that it's framed,0.037626114
in this way and it almost feels like a comedy in the way it's shot,0.20721468
but it makes the characters appeal pathetic because they're small and significant which is a,0.2937974
good thing it also lets us see the lovely set design there are few scenes,0.03659641
where no nice white hair is against the white background which might be a mistake,0.098247625
but over where we really enjoyed the set design it doesn't try to glamorize China,0.07341499
or make it exotic and a fantastical like some imagined it to be it actually,0.033258516
feels nostalgic in all of its imperfections the fact that it seems old-fashioned or even,0.043795027
tacky especially the wedding stuff it gives it this undeniable charm I especially love the,0.0475001
clothes that the elderly family members wear like the best and the flip-flops and just,0.15726605
the lovely patterns and obviously the flat caps and everything it feels familiar and therefore,0.02457521
nostalgic even though I know obviously a lot of viewers when an experienced it firsthand,0.024616452
it doesn't feel like an international film and Hollywood sense obviously and it isn't it's,0.017598098
an American film this film is about integrity and culture differences in a single way,0.01075735
is it wrong to lie or rather hide the fatal illness of a loved one,0.05434484
or to save them from the pain and fear of dying that is essentially the,0.05531667
question of the film is asking Billy who is American above all protests to lie,0.10125026
struggling to understand why family members could do something so immoral in her eyes but,0.0867293
it's a typical criticism that people have of China and its culture you know ignorance,0.22457778
is bliss that it is but Americans and Western culture object to the idea that,0.05197346
someone isn't fully informed of their situation but perhaps is designed in such a way,0.016696775
in order for people to live happily and free from discomfort or pain I mean,0.13874999
personally I'm on the side of the Westerners I'm West and which is why this,0.02033799
film is truly an American film because our point of view characters American with American,0.00842322
sensibility is everything Western morals we learn about Chinese traditions through her like scene at,0.05295261
the graveyard she shown the almost bizarre ways they show respect to their past loved,0.04378638
ones this scene nervous he says as a funny scene something I've always found a,0.042551797
bit boring about actual Chinese films is that they're just too serious or their comedy,0.119047254
is just too outrageous and just not funny but the farewell has the subtle but,0.065496646
respectful element of comedy it does it really well there's a poignant moment in the,0.02379362
film where Billy's uncle tells her that the main difference between East and West is,0.020000743
that Westerners Billy ones life belongs to oneself but in reality one's life forms part,0.060927495
of a whole it belongs to family and to society individualism is very Western and,0.033909068
is ultimately considered selfish when a family member dies the pain extends to the family,0.2053954
but equally Billy ashamed for being so openly sad about it that hurt sadface will,0.12056919
bring everyone else down it's as if she is expected to do what's right for,0.032846104
the family by not resigning to her own selfishness she wasn't able to attend her,0.15182285
grandfather's funeral in the past in fact it was kept a secret from her too,0.041755572
but the thing is is that she doesn't understand the difficulties it would have caused,0.0363024
her from a financial point of view nor the stress it would put on her,0.048304304
parents to tell her but as a result she wasn't able to get closure and,0.05408675
she feels that she's entitled to it as she should feel death is difficult but,0.27358803
you can't necessarily share grief you shouldn't be able to dictate how someone should feel,0.03210176
when suffering from a bereavement grief is personal though it can be shared as a,0.037697952
kid we can resent our parents for doing this or thing for the rest of,0.047514066
our life even after we've had our own kid I completely empathize with Billy despite,0.047854643
the intentions of her family that's what makes this film so thought-provoking eventually Billy becomes,0.06877533
part of the family by sort of finally one last time resisting the desire to,0.031529706
tell 9i the truth but this time she's learned the significance of playing her part,0.021965029
of this family despite her moral compass pointing her in the other direction but she,0.043461103
doesn't accept this reality out of submission or fear or anger or anything like that,0.030938357
but rather out of love for her family especially for her 9 a this is,0.05456435
a moment visually signified by the slow motion tracking shot of the family walking together,0.09156452
or looking into the camera Lulu Wong says in an interview that it's meant to,0.03862123
be a dramatic representation of Billy's feelings as she finally embraces the line so it,0.039454702
was gonna say a bunch of other little bits that I liked in no particular,0.15582658
order I like how when she arrives in China after the flight she gets assaulted,0.25482556
by taxi drivers trying to get to buy a taxi or to get in their,0.01325977
taxi or whatever I mean this happened to me when I visited China so it's,0.074519195
and yet it's quite intimidating there's a great establishing shot of the apartment complex for,0.054037523
her 9i lives when Billy first arrives and it's so different from New York it's,0.08666744
also very much a communal building the flat doesn't stand out or anything it forms,0.07440079
part of a whole series of flats but you know maybe I'm just looking too,0.013594358
deep into it then they're necessary but I just feel like it has that sentiment,0.04336332
of community versus the individualism of New York also the relationship between her and her,0.046626046
mother is extremely like mine as in with my mother my Chinese mother and I'm,0.09193503
sure many people regardless of their mother's homeland can agree that they have a similarly,0.07065381
tense and passive-aggressive relationship at times though one of the many awkward dinner scenes are,0.04490788
the one where they're at the restaurant with the lazy susan they're just something so,0.07741274
uncomfortable it's great it's essentially like oh no it's just a thing in Chinese culture,0.111142874
but it's almost like every conversation with family is like a battle or competition of,0.02153532
who's more successful is America better than China you know you always competing with each,0.03726758
other you shut trying to show off just success because success is the biggest sign,0.15327893
of prosperity obviously means money and success and safety it da bobba I had to,0.03339355
I had to look up the drinking game that play play where there they're like,0.011641379
flapping their arms or whatever okay so essentially every player in the group gets a,0.06680506
number so you just name yourselves in a circle and then what you're supposed to,0.0598938
say is number bird Flyers number bird Flyers so if I say I'm one I,0.038396396
go one bird flies one bird flies one bird Flyers till three bird flies and,0.06227915
then the person who's named three has to then continue but you can do things,0.03511571
that are tricky like you could look at someone you could say you can look,0.07551165
at number five but you say six and then five stuff starts to think that,0.0103715435
it's their turn and then they start going and then they have to drink basically,0.060180496
if you make a mistake or if you miss your turn then you have to,0.10384781
drink and obviously the more you drink the harder it gets so yeah it's pretty,0.13103719
funny to me also I have to play it with so my friends anyway this,0.030683592
film is absolutely lovely even though I weep like a baby whenever I watch it,0.20122936
and watched it a second time yesterday seeing the grandmother waving goodbye to them at,0.042104796
the end of the film it's unbearable I just kind of imagined my own grandma,0.043629397
and it's so hard I feel like I wanted to watch this film completely objectively,0.051871687
but you you can't you can't not think about your own experiences of these things,0.052764364
that's what film is it's what art is right it's supposed to evoke emotion but,0.020310717
it's hard yeah but overall yeah the film it's it's very approachable despite being almost,0.06234633
entirely a Mandarin and obviously despite the subject matter it isn't an art film but,0.019574359
it's almost certainly an independent film please allow yourself to experience it I'm happy to,0.031187136
hear it won the Independent Spirit Award for best film of the year - I,0.0071999477
mean it's always nice to see films like that get recognition because now I feel,0.035637215
like it's helping to promote films of this kind of nature it just means there's,0.035109058
more film to me to talk about my channel and we thanks so much for,0.032682467
