it's very sad and very scary that when it comes to hatred in America so little has changed since the 1970s when this film takes place I mean on top of black Klansmen intentionally and powerfully driving home its point with actual footage of Charlottesville in 2017 in that whole situation including footage of President Trump at the end of the film black Klansmen also inadvertently draws amazing parallels considering that it couldn't have known this was going to happen between the hate speech film The Birth of a Nation which was allowed at the time to become a national mainstream blockbuster and this movie even points out that a plate at the White House,0.19246572
it contrasts that again inadvertently with the story this week that several digital distributors have decided to stop carrying Infowars because they feel it qualifies as hate speech and the contrast between stepping in and stopping something and not stepping in and stopping it,0.097309284
and what it does to society as a whole it's really interesting stuff,0.13829273
and by the way I've never actually seen the birth of a nation of course I'm familiar with it but they show chunks significant chunks of the movie here,0.08980199
and it is something something truly awful and shocking to see now our this month,0.17535919
it was James Baldwin's birthday which was promoted very heavily this year because moonlights Barry Jenkins has his own Oscar contender coming up which is based on Baldwin's novel,0.09601458
so there there was a an incentivized push to celebrate Baldwin's birthday and to get his name out there that I think that that film will probably be more Oscar friendly for the reasons I'm about to outline but there was an amazing quote from Baldwin which I came across that day which was I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates,0.19917919
so stubbornly is because they sense once hate is gone they will be forced to deal with pain,0.31089434
and that is an amazing very astute quote and a nuance that I think this movie misses it's KKK members are as much caricatures as the disgusting characters and the caricatures and the birth of a nation rather than really exploring what creates a hate,0.42201197
so great that someone couldn't stand even be touched by someone of a different race or religion and would actually take great joy in their torture and death and so in a lot of ways black clansmen is I would say preaching to the choir and breaks little new ground and exploring something that's been a dirty horrifying secret in America since its inception,0.69542736
I mean I guess it explores it and explores it in new ways but it doesn't break new ground,0.07072174
it's like it's a it's a different way to have a discussion,0.062448014
we've already been having to me,0.07811751
the most unique thing about black Klansmen is that while it juxtaposes very effectively white and black power extremist groups at the heart of the story is a black moderate wrong Stallworth,0.26389575
and the white moderates who work with him at the Colorado Springs Police Department which with the exception of one or two unsavory characters seems like an amazing place to work like these are a great group of guys and that moderate viewpoint unusual for Hollywood I think will be a welcome change for many,0.19148348
and perhaps maybe we'll get a couple of people outside of the choir to watch and consider this film now I could watch this film all day long thanks to John David Washington's Ron Stallworth I mean the promotion for this movie has not done his performance justice,0.07777078
it is something worthy of a Coen Brothers movie the movie itself is not though side note,0.10247147
this whole thing Spike Lee borrows heavily from the Coen brothers but he never turns it up to an 11 an absurdity shock value or high art as the Coen brothers do so well where you're like damn that is weird and crazy beautiful,0.5395829
and this comes close a couple of times I think that Spike Lee felt the absurdity of the situation would do that,0.20537716
but again this is a conversation we've been having very intently,0.07647115
for,0.028156307
the you know the past couple of years now again,0.05346615
and so I think that that those qualities aren't quite there the way that maybe he had hoped but could have been if I think he'd been a little bit bolder from an artistic perspective,0.14622301
but I also think it's great that while John David washing denzel's son he is very much his own actor and doesn't try to capitalize on any of his father's signature moves they say you would never guess they were related but they are both very talented and while I didn't think much of him as an actor before this movie I'd seen him on like one or two episodes of ballers,0.103732236
and I wasn't impressed with the whole thing quite frankly,0.080919065
but now I think he should be on every casting shortlist and I'm very excited to see him again shortly and Robert Redford's the old man in the gun where he plays another police officer actually our detective,0.24213077
I think in that film now the rest of the cast does a very nice job in addition with a few standouts and then also a couple people who sucked but let's talk about the good people first so Adam driver gives an understated but powerful performance as a jewish detective who has to come to terms with having past,0.5200052
you know past most of his life and coming you know something that he hadn't even considered laura hair is very likable as an unwavering member of the Black Power movement even to a fault which I thought was very brave of the movie to also explore Corey Hawkins anchors a very compelling,0.1722868
and moving sequence of a rally where he speaks as a black panther member Kwame Toure the way like Spike Lee that was really great like the way he would focus on black faces in the crowd being moved by the words of Kwame Toure that was pretty neat stuff,0.1508772
there was one of the better I think maybe more artistic moments of the movie and then Harry Belafonte has an unforgettable scene where you actually believe he lives,0.068203025
he lived the story he's telling and finally in the good category Ken ggarrido,0.49013716
plays the best police boss you could ever ask for such a sweetheart but like he still seemed like a realistic member of the police department I loved him I was like that guy so great,0.18563798
and as for the actors who didn't quite work out Alec Baldwin practically embarrassed himself I feel he did embarrass himself and a small supposedly comedic cameo at the beginning of the film that's just a mess,0.32220456
it does Network,0.04418472
I even feel maybe it should've been cut,0.2416313
Nicholas Turturro,0.053633194
I know he's a spike Lee favorite,0.18423878
but he is the least convincing KKK I've ever seen I'd be like that guy wouldn't be welcomed by the KKK what and then while Paul Walter Hauser is very funny as another KKK member interestingly building off his eye Tania performance last year he stands out in both movies but he Jasper poq Onan and Ashley Atkinson are also clownish in their performances and not I would say in an effective way,0.53185666
so while I found black Klansmen extremely entertaining and powerful featuring some stellar performances I think it's just shy of greatness,0.114404954
so I don't see it going the distance in terms of awards season,0.036525674
I can maybe see it getting some nominations,0.10857287
it's because of the subject matter Spike Lee you know Jason Blum Perdue Jason Blum and Jordan Peele producing behind the scenes it's an attractive package,0.07543527
but it just you know again as I said it doesn't go the distance it's just shy of greatness as an awards film is like a film for the for the ages,0.0819171
but as a piece of entertainment and a way to spend two-plus hours of your time,0.16971654
it's great I would actually put it along the lines of like really great television,0.06955483
you know like along like better call Saul or something or Breaking Bad or something like that or Fargo,0.17949311
you know based of course on the Coen brothers work it has that quality to it but for a movie and even I think even for us to tell standout television show again just misses the mark just misses it,0.063144565
it certainly gave me a lot to think about though maybe and hopefully you know again preaching to the choir,0.07735774
but I hope it reaches a couple of people as well so anyway,0.1380654
that's my review of black Klansmen I'd be very curious to hear your thoughts down,0.4378166
below don't put any spoilers in or at least,0.15150936
if you have a spoiler market is such because I think there are a couple of interesting twists and turns in the film now I guess,0.052592628
finally you might be like why don't you mention Topher Grace grace,0.25306705
and actually when I was at the press screening someone said another member of the press was like oh I heard people saying Topher Grace should get nominated for an Oscar like maybe just because he was willing to play David Duke,0.08025087
but I don't think that's fair cuz,0.068615325
I don't think his per he's just Topher Grace and a wig and he's like oh a mustache like,0.3833298
he's it's hair acting right like he he said he did a lot of research for the role,0.079346545
but I didn't see it,0.04377555
I think that,0.04509421
he's actually one of the least effective like,0.13121162
he like Topher Grace talking about this character said he was surprised looking at old footage of David Duke how effective he was and maybe making people think what he was saying wasn't horrible,0.18687677
so I didn't see that with Topher Grace I just saw Topher Grace,0.05420837
so I think that another actor maybe would have been able to get that disturbing quality across that gray zone,0.26423827
if you will all right so write your thoughts down below and of course as always you can check out some more videos,0.19250967
right,0.04255815
