time to find some joy and some love for yourself and for the community this,0.0766551
month now I originally really wanted to start kick off this month on the second,0.27042574
but you know the world was the world had other plans so I took a,0.022972118
week off because we we wasn't doing that so we're back we're a little more,0.0402629
sane and we're excited to talk about moonlight that moonlight is a film directed by,0.02710956
Barry Jenkins they came out in 2016 it's based off of a play by Tarell,0.04467573
Alvin McCraney titled in moonlight black boys look blue all night is a story about,0.010510567
a young black man named shyrone and he's growing up in the 1980s in my,0.23449771
hearing you see three sections of his life where he is a child where he's,0.1912097
a teenager and when he's an adult as with most coming-of-age movies he's kind of,0.106858425
figure out who he is where he fits into the world and where he kind,0.17760803
of fits in with his environment you might have heard of moonlight back in like,0.01893911
2017 during Oscar season because they had a whole fiasco at the Oscars where the,0.03305497
announcer said the wrong title for the award originally they said la-la-land and the Academy,0.022898948
Award for Best Picture la-la-land it was like oh just kidding it's actually moonlight so,0.013676176
they ended up actually winning the award there's a mistake moonlight you guys won Best,0.0314266
Picture this is not a joke moonlight is won Best Picture the Oscars Fiasco aside,0.023040632
let's talk about my thoughts on this movie let me give you a little background,0.04578193
this movie came out in 2016 but at the time I thought oh this looks,0.035643864
interesting but in 2016 I wasn't really in two movies like I am nowadays I,0.03737201
was just like especially Oscar movies cuz I was like hmm this is probably gonna,0.034556955
be some like bougie pretentious hoity-toity kind of movie that I'm just gonna be sitting,0.08143045
here like what was that supposed to mean to me so I kind of just,0.03774385
brushed it off for a little bit and then the word season came around and,0.037536312
it was getting some acclaim but I was like oh I need to go watch,0.029766303
that and then I think I just you know you'd be having the list of,0.029916635
movies that you're like oh I need to go watch this and then at some,0.032892667
point your list gets too long you starts again some that's where I wasn't moonlight,0.037497066
so I attempted to watch the one year my best friend we both I don't,0.023678543
know something happened with the internet it was acting funky we're never watching it so,0.038325887
come bleep me I'm finally like oh I want to finally watch something like oh,0.16452053
oh I can watch it and then review for Pride Month because I knew it,0.02986209
was an LGBTQ story so I was like this would be perfect so I watched,0.07771008
it fell in love I love this movie it's so good like there's like movies,0.05603374
that are good there cuz you know they entertain you and they kind of make,0.045509204
you laugh and they're just like oh well that was you know a fun old,0.08956831
time but this movie is just beautiful like it is a work of art to,0.07299992
me it's it's like it's the epitome of like oh film you know there's like,0.055406474
movies and there's films this to me is like oh film one of the things,0.06715561
I love is that it's such a subtle movie like the main themes of the,0.029824173
movie is not hitting you over the head you're not getting smacked by you every,0.21374679
five seconds you're not sitting here like oh my god okay I get it director,0.10871096
I know what you're trying to say like the story encompasses a boy's life so,0.042460002
it feels realistic everything about it is not you know usually in some movies that,0.024982302
want to hit you with a message they like message take this message and you're,0.44308656
like all right you know I got you I see you but this one it's,0.049679905
like and it's just it's so it's just so subtle that I love it so,0.02754725
much there's a bunch of topics that I just kind of illustrated in the background,0.037178446
or in like a subsection of the fire I guess you want to say that,0.057539716
you don't fully paying attention until you may be watching a couple times or you're,0.036942303
like hmm I would if they were trying to say this about that or if,0.03821214
they were trying to give an example of something like this so like two topics,0.05377677
at least I saw in the movie is the showing of like the school to,0.02124796
Prison Pipeline and masculine in black culture the masculine you want is a little more,0.067921236
shown but the school to Prison Pipeline drugs in neighborhoods living up in a poor,0.17722954
neighborhood all of those kind of combined together and it's just background or like little,0.048132688
pieces of the plot but you're so focused on the characters that you're like oh,0.034414608
wait a minute like they're trying to say they think they just proved that or,0.04986416
they're trying to say that or like oh I love it now speaking of the,0.019225137
movie focusing on its characters this will be such an intimate movie like you're really,0.08635813
up close and personal for a lot of the shots you're really only focusing on,0.11715015
"so much characters like there's not really like 6,000 characters you need to keep track",0.03062572
of and with this person's plotline is it's really a story about Shai Rome so,0.018500088
you only really see things through Sharon's perspectives sometimes you'll get a little glimpse of,0.0453469
somebody else's perspective but for the most part you only see through Shiro is not,0.018974364
much dialogue in here so the actors really got a focus on facial expressions and,0.058395807
body language which I'll talk about the actors later but oh they just do it,0.027467428
so well they tell so much things this movie does a great job of showing,0.03186895
and not telling you know usually if you hear like a story or you watch,0.030504657
a movie the critique is don't tell your audience everything make sure you can show,0.018156853
it by somebody's actions their facial expressions you know things going on in the background,0.12601173
so that way you're not making your audience feel stupid by telling them everything that's,0.3933206
going on another thing I really love about this movie is you get a slight,0.06963475
sense of what it's like growing up in the hood because like I said this,0.030301776
takes place in Miami it's a poor neighborhood so you see what it's like when,0.08937009
there's in your neighborhood you can see what it's like when you know your parents,0.039893057
are working in some of them just don't pay attention to you and you kind,0.045706097
of see what it's like for the kids who are going you know going through,0.024740174
this and and how they interact with each other also since you're getting kind of,0.026848143
a glimpse of what it's like to live in a poor neighborhood they don't focus,0.14542711
and rely on stereotypes which I love because it's it's refreshing where it's like it's,0.022424672
a story about a young black man growing up in the hood and there's no,0.121422626
you know real obvious stereotypes the topics that this covers are similar to kind of,0.03319466
the stereotypes but they do it in a way where it's more realistic and less,0.024471441
you know exaggerated I told you there's drugs that are kind of mentioned in this,0.07391188
movie but the way they talk about drugs is never like glamorized this doesn't seem,0.059655666
like oh I want to be a drug dealer one day like no glamorizing the,0.23625767
subject no one's extra aggressive for no reason like there's lots of good cases of,0.025513783
it just being you know like oh this is just there this would really do,0.020578787
a great job of depicting do different ways that closeted a gay man might act,0.13135181
in a poorer neighborhood especially a poor black neighborhood I'll give you a slight spoiler,0.4161481
but there's a character named Kevin and he's of there closeted gay Mian in the,0.049383234
movie now both of them act in certain ways definitely based on personality and definitely,0.030009095
based on the fact that they are both closeted both of them are you know,0.07236799
closeted gay men but both are acting in a different way to make sure they're,0.3564305
still you know being closeted Sharon's just consoling he if you say he's gay he's,0.3988839
like just doesn't make any comment on it or he'll just be like no and,0.029486926
you know don't try to prove nothing Kevin I love the hand he's trying to,0.051232446
prove that he's an I gave and trying to beat you to even having the,0.23277524
assumption that he could be gay oh they're very valid ways that someone can can,0.27204382
act in those environments so for them to showcase both of them is so great,0.079146214
to me me usually when you see coming of the LGBT community that's black usually,0.2005083
they kind of fall into the extremes at least what usually ends up happening in,0.08042602
entertainment so usually they're either very very feminine or very very masculine both are very,0.07797349
you know valid ways that people live but the media always tends to do the,0.015713634
extremes now Kevin and shyrone to me for more in the middle cash our own,0.05048611
these Falls more towards the feminine side because of the stereotypes that people associate with,0.06258047
being feminine so you kind of fits in its light like a little little nudge,0.20407103
but not you know not obviously to the extreme Kevin's masculine in stereotypical terms of,0.03002506
being masculine but you know not all the way at the end of the spectrum,0.051187214
because he's not looking for a fight he's not beating up somebody every five seconds,0.20266482
he's not only ever talking about girls if it's more I want to say like,0.15658024
more in the middle but you know still still a little masculine which you know,0.039956916
obviously it's especially lost all members of the spectrum are it completely valued by for,0.017441114
the media for our film to show to people who are kind of you know,0.0666973
in the middle on lunch maybe on one side or another is so great because,0.017931355
it allows young black gay men and you know anybody else to be like okay,0.5829377
there's more than just obviously the extremes there's people in the middle there's people who,0.053469457
maybe not on one side listening spectrums or spectrums because people can fly all over,0.024039071
they want to me it's so important that the media showcases both of them or,0.03543566
just kind of chilling now let's talk about the filmmaking of this movie disclaimer I,0.035896637
am NOT a film critic I really just recently just got into kind of focusing,0.046906754
on a film but the parts of it some rather than just looking at the,0.022269018
movie as a whole I really just kind of started looking at what is the,0.019478573
soundtrack China saying what is the lighting trying to say and what are they trying,0.04288971
to say by zooming in or the wide shot saying in the plot and all,0.09706626
those kind of thing I just only just started so pick it as someone who's,0.03987776
just kind of getting more into movies because I used to just be a casual,0.06445962
movie watcher now I'm really kind of focusing on you know what's going on in,0.035838764
the movie moon lights filming with Beijing's directing and everybody else of part of the,0.023925325
film crew who you know had some input in it I think they just did,0.034493096
such a good job now like I said it's just my opinion but my opinion,0.029697789
is backed up by critics because if you're gonna write in Tomatoes more Lighting's definitely,0.03227737
saying that like a ninety-eight ninety-nine percent which is obviously really good and then if,0.033720154
you look at the Oscars from 2016 you can see that they won best picture,0.019946862
which is one of the most prestigious awards you can get during the award seasons,0.011091937
and at the Oscars there's a won an Oscar for Best Screenplay adaption and then,0.013111435
I believe Marshall I won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor I think regardless pretty,0.040564895
sure they also got a Golden Globe like I read like the talk during an,0.03667357
awards season so I mean I'm saying it's good but you also have prestigious you,0.030057654
know boozy filmmakers who are also agreeing with my opinion even though they won there,0.026229521
two or three Oscars I still think Barry Jenkins probably should have got like a,0.020482335
Best Director Oscar because he did such a fantastic job I mean like in the,0.037504386
movie I feel like each scene has a purpose which sounds stupid because you know,0.34516963
it's a movie all the scenes should have a purpose in the end but nowadays,0.049543545
most movies be having scenes for who knows what reason just to have the scene,0.05780845
if you think about a movie in your life well they probably could have cut,0.11252047
out this scene there's no scene in this movie that they could cut out that's,0.06096275
how purposeful each scene if this movie is because you take one part out and,0.07372696
you're gonna be slightly lost like and I just think I just think that's so,0.072183736
impressive like I said I'm not a film critic but so that might be the,0.023278102
basis of all really good films but to me it's just so impressive that each,0.050873246
scene is so pivotal and so you know impactful for the the message of the,0.04100059
movie as I said previously this movie doesn't beat you over its head with the,0.095335454
message of the movie and the theme however they do have some themes that you,0.025650147
can pick up on let's reoccurring in the movie like I said it's still not,0.043490373
beating you over the head but you notice them if you paying attention so one,0.46933684
of the things is the color blue the color blue is mentioned and shown many,0.002485125
a times in this movie as I told you the screenplay that the movie this,0.031898882
is based off of is called in like black boys love blue so obviously they,0.074607
were gonna incorporate blue in there but they did such a great job of just,0.033555187
little hints of blue lights sometimes a character would be wearing the color blue but,0.0065154736
you don't even notice cuz you just like well it's a shirt the walls will,0.0511167
be blue you know something that the background is blue all of these things that,0.019553738
you don't fully you're just like oh well you know it's just the color the,0.085062355
way they implement it I was always trying to tell you something the same can,0.027286498
be said for water water is also mentioned and shown in the movie I mean,0.017788341
first of all they're living in Miami so you're gonna see the water at the,0.07062787
beach because it's Miami so there's the beach scenes that's kind of recurring in the,0.061319288
movie and there's other little things that just kind of deal with water that always,0.02035994
mean something I won't obviously go into full detail with all the mentions of water,0.021659045
and the color blue because I'm not trying to spoil the whole movie for you,0.027478736
but if you give it a watch pay attention to some of those things and,0.024164792
you know actually self what is it trying to say what is it trying to,0.023847498
invoke out of you why do you think they put it there because I think,0.0811391
it's fun to try to see what you interpret out of it and if you,0.03934295
do come back to this video and let me know or you know me personally,0.11725259
hit me up and let me know along with the the lighting of the themes,0.2659064
the sound design of this movie ooh sound design is also as impactful as the,0.027357673
lighting in like the camera shots because this movie has little dialogue compared to like,0.06385098
a normal movie there's a good amount of scenes where people aren't talking where it's,0.0689403
just kind of silent and I know you're probably like Sabrina silence is not a,0.03147649
part of sound design but it is good sound as I so really focuses on,0.008664017
the silent moments of the film which moon like does moonlight features some really silent,0.016087467
bushings or like close to starting where you just hear like a little whisper of,0.054966122
classical music the silence and sometimes some of the scenes is so important because you,0.07554225
feel you know how shyrone is feeling in the moment you can tell just the,0.018577915
way that the silence works with the film there's also some parts where the sound,0.046015408
kind of gets distorted and those are the kind of things that kind of put,0.098244965
you in the position of shyrone and you can kind of feel what he's feeling,0.061729044
just based on you know the weights some of the sound is distorted or it,0.020482335
sounds like you're underwater or if you're at the beach how come kind of feel,0.043746468
or or the loneliness and the silence you all kind of feel those as if,0.2278656
you're shy room I also would like to mention that the fact that this is,0.034514382
a movie about a young black man in you know technically the hoodie soundtrack is,0.07353272
not ramping with hip-hop I'm not saying that's a problem but it's refreshing they're always,0.01972336
putting the association with hip-hop with you know being a young black man or just,0.34372422
a black man in general honestly I mean I think there's maybe two sections where,0.3091614
they have hip-hop playing but for the most part it's silent it's the sounds of,0.028532388
the environment or there's like classical or old-school like doo-wop and R&B the way moonlight,0.056033075
ends is something I also really admire about this movie this movies sort of like,0.050587215
a coming of age and usually but those kind of movies you know by the,0.017663952
end of the movie all the problems that was in the movie is solved everything's,0.03577624
wrapped up in a nice little bow you know that they're going into college or,0.07652472
you know that they find the love of their life or whatever you know all,0.07203074
the issues with their parents are relatively solved for the time being but the way,0.018903188
this ends to me is so much more realistic I'll give you this analogy it,0.039887737
ends where it's like you and a friend are talking and talking about a story,0.029195575
that happened in their life but instead of going and then you know we hug,0.016777927
then everything was great they go and you know I don't know we'll see what,0.042472642
that's kind of how this movie and not everything needs to be fully told to,0.022826442
you you can have some liberty of having some fun and figuring out on your,0.10162942
own one thing I really wanted to make sure I mentioned about moonlight it's the,0.025651477
fact that this movie has an all black cast did you hear me I said,0.22371358
all black cast and and I would say at minimum 80% of the cast is,0.06791924
all dark-skinned people like can I get a hearty Amen I say that because usually,0.6808909
we're talking about a backup movie film TV show I guarantee you they're gonna focus,0.045600336
on light-skinned or brown skinned people and though maybe have one maybe two four really,0.32578173
lucky dark-skinned characters but this movie this movie said not not a lot we gonna,0.31053028
have mostly dark-skinned black people in our movie and I'm just oh but I will,0.75902027
critique though is that the women in this film are not dark-skinned white I'm taking,0.2688262
what I can I'm a big advocate for dark-skinned people in TV shows and film,0.4601723
because we just don't be getting that kind of representation and I need that in,0.025315559
my life when I say all black has yes I'm talking about the main characters,0.1876809
that we're focusing on all of them are black why the director Bear Jenkins a,0.21916737
black man Tarell Alvin McCraney who wrote the original play black gay man I mean,0.43506432
let's really dive into the importance of this all-black cast and the writers and director,0.17484951
being black people because what did I say earlier none of this feels stereotypical they're,0.50147325
not beating you over the head with stereotypical black thing why because it's written by,0.59333193
black people directed by black people so they know they know they lived it they,0.67347246
know the experiences that will go on in real life so what do they do,0.024374325
they put real life into action this is why we need black people right in,0.5014133
black people before I started getting real high over the black cast I really want,0.48833236
to talk about the actors who play Kevin and shyrone as previously mentioned the movie,0.023394508
covers three chapters of shower rooms like so obviously there's gonna be three different actors,0.07097376
playing Shiro and Kevin appears in all three of these chapters of Shaun's life so,0.0163868
there's also gonna be three actors who play Kevin now the three actors who play,0.0212453
shy rooms but those are all is played by two auntie Rhodes teenage Tyrone is,0.029422402
played by Ashton Sanders and kitchen Aaron is played by Alex Herbert Charles the lead,0.025254363
character all three of them really needed to be on their game and all three,0.015655097
of them absolutely delivered shyrone is not much of a speaker he doesn't talk much,0.033996873
in this movie so a lot of the acting that goes into this movie is,0.026391827
his body language and facial expressions so for all three of these actors to exude,0.13137576
the same energy and characteristics that shyrone would have is magnificent with Kevin we don't,0.025838394
get as much time with him because obviously he's not the main character and not,0.036772016
in his perspective but I'm still not going to diminish their role because all three,0.038480207
of them are still and tastic little kevin is played by actor named Jayden minor,0.05501867
teenage Kevin is played by jor-el Jerome an adult Kevin is played by Andre Holland,0.027148806
all of them are so charming because that's one of the main characteristics of Kevin,0.03551615
at least to me is he's a very charming man he's very likeable though for,0.08018523
all three of them to be charming in the same way at the various different,0.035402402
ages is Jeff's case since I'm talking about Kevin and sharone I want to talk,0.014138479
about the way that this film depicts their relationship I say shyrone and Kevin's relationship,0.03966756
is one of my favorite things about this movie because it plays right into what,0.055006698
I really enjoy now as you're getting to watch more of my videos and hear,0.056405578
about some of my opinions you'll learn that I love a good subtle flirting I,0.037454497
enjoy the real your face flirting that's that's fun and all but I really love,0.110848196
a good subtle flirtation where you mister viewer are like oh what they just are,0.059934378
they just flirting like oh they're trying to play it off as if they're not,0.04672782
flirting but they're definitely flirting cuz you're looking at their eyes and you're looking at,0.03991102
the way they're acting and you're like order definitely flirting that's my Jo what's just,0.052034657
was he looking at me like that so now they're obviously not going to be,0.04894488
