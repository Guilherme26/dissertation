best spider-man movie best Stan Lee cameo,0.10373766
now I'd say come at me and I'm sure many of you will because this movie doesn't open to the public until December 14th,0.17988677
but when you finally feast your eyes upon this masterpiece you will realize that I am speaking the truth seriously at my press screening well first off,0.058624513
we were all just so delighted to see it,0.05993187
so freaking early but the entire theater sat in complete silence except for applause for the Stan Lee cameo and a lot of us and like I'm gonna cry was so perfect we'll get to the Stan Lee cameo a little bit later don't worry this is the non-spoiler review and there will be a spoiler review because there's so much to talk about,0.3849736
but anyway the other the other instance when someone who's talking was the little boy next to me and I will share that in my spoiler review but for the most part because I don't want to give away what he was reacting to it looks adorable but anyway for the most part yes complete silence as we said on barely able to process,0.1517738
what we were seeing we had no idea it would be this good,0.08981223
and as I left the theater I heard many people proclaim best spider-man movie ever it's I know it's gonna be so hard for many of you to believe but it's really really good,0.10183344
now I think that's partially because it's got a Spider Man for everybody you'll get bit by a spider you'll get bit by a spider and while our main spiders delightfully so are miles Peter and Gwen the other spiders really make their mark and I'm amazed at how accessible this movie makes alternate realities for non comic-book readers I mean I am a comic book reader and I love me some alternate realities but I've never liked it with spider-man,0.09659569
but here rapt attention I think my favorite thing about the movie is that it takes itself so seriously,0.12572093
I mean it's animated,0.111530766
so it can be highly stylized and closer to its comic-book roots right from the get-go and you even see the way this movie opens with the credits you'll be like,0.09527885
I think I'm in for something special and you are but it's very much still it seems very much like a live-action movie you've been hoping for in terms,0.118369006
we know when it comes to the evolution of animation,0.10160868
but I'm talking about scope depth action scenes and what's at stake,0.12337411
this is the Beauty,0.15007469
and the Beast of superhero animated movies I'm also in awe of this movie's authenticity this is Miles Morales,0.17357841
this is Peter Parker Spider Gwen but it's also miles this extended family such great characters Kington Aunt May and well there are some surprises here yes while the trailers have been amazing I am so impressed with how much they've been able to keep hidden about this movie,0.046328623
and I mean I can't find the running time anywhere online and I checked my invitation and even Sony didn't provide it whoa,0.06939315
this is a long movie but in like in a really good way where you're like,0.11107735
I can't believe we'll be still going,0.075478636
I never want it to end keep going keep going,0.16001561
yes,0.036876976
give me more,0.092197016
I really,0.034917086
I hope hope they're working on the sequel right,0.21042524
now although I have another idea which we'll talk about in just a moment,0.055380125
but for those of you first of all worried about getting miles just right,0.082997166
oh boy do,0.08093222
they,0.029486282
he even speaks Spanish for instance I know a number of you,0.08517298
were worried about that but most importantly he feels is real and unique as he did when he was first introduced in the comics because in the comics recently and I think this has to do with Brian Michael Bendis his attention being drawn elsewhere first within Marvel and then leaving for DC but miles has lost his way as a character over the past couple of years I've bought every single one of his comics always enjoyed them even though it's been waning a little bit recently,0.09273288
and I'm hoping that this movie reminds Marvel and Sony what a great and valuable character,0.14893202
he is I would love to see shameik Moore very talented actor should meet more fans since um since dope but he does the voice of Miles Morales and I would love to see him appear alongside Tom Holland in a future live-action spider-man movie and you know,0.22320046
I'd actually say the same for Hailee Steinfeld who I don't usually enjoy but she is perfectly cast as spider-gwen,0.25565714
I really liked her too come to think of it they animated these characters to look a little bit like the actors so they could do it they could jump to the live-action but there will always be a special place in my heart for Jake,0.088687
Johnson spider-man,0.16127469
I have waited so long for an adult spider-man to appear on screen and it was worth the wait he is perfect,0.16655453
I also want to warn you at the beginning of the movie like myself,0.18713063
you might be like where's Jake Johnson's voice did they cast a different voice,0.08378624
don't worry he's coming,0.11534815
it's just part of a twist in a movie full of twists then as I said truly true believer best Stan Lee cameo ever no shirt to be fair coming right after his tragic passing it does pull on the old heartstrings just a bit harder,0.12258745
but I still think even if you take that element away it's the best Stan Lee cameo because I think for one it's associated with spider-man the character,0.07789941
he's the most associated,0.064186476
with,0.024530113
and then he's given such a wonderful line that he says to Miles Morales,0.0502498
it's like almost as good as the one he wrote for spider-man in the comics with great power comes great responsibility,0.12024853
and I think it even plays on that a little bit,0.15493332
it was just it perfectly captured Stan Lee and on that note this is a really well-written movie so kudos to Phil Lord,0.06411571
and he usually works with Chris Miller as his writing partner,0.04650766
but here he's writing with Rodney Rahman,0.078225486
they wrote a movie that is scary thrilling absolutely hilarious and has so much respect for the source material and while I heard Sony isn't pushing this for Best Animated Feature which is insane,0.31089434
I hope that was just something I misheard because it's stupid,0.7451546
I still hope to see this directing trio here acknowledged for their work,0.096898034
because this is the biggest leap in animation since Disney's Paperman,0.15787753
so if you love spider-man Stan Lee Comics superheroes and animation aimed at adults it's here it's happening,0.16440853
this is the moment please I'm begging you go see this movie I know there are ton of movies coming out right now,0.110852845
but really it is so worth your time definitely,0.084495224
it's my favorite animated movie of the probably one of my most favorite animated movies of all time but definitely for the year and yes I do remember what came out in 2018,0.032846995
