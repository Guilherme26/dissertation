I realize that the propaganda war movies in Hollywood was making during the 1940s we're not a good idea right,0.127761
that's that's not good for anyone,0.1493256
although of course when you see what Christopher Nolan has done here you understand why they did that because I think that hooker boy the pendulum has totally swung too far in the other direction with this film,0.6364068
and I am genuinely shocked at the way Christopher Nolan has decided to portray British soldiers in this film,0.08347091
he's British,0.2037361
why would he send us about his own military and his fellow citizens who who put their lives on the line to protect England,0.07837043
I mean it's just absolutely incredible as I tweeted he swaps Band of Brothers you know that idea for world war ii with every man for himself,0.18987519
and some people when i tweeted that row like well that's what it was like grace,0.07555319
it was really tough out there,0.03445038
you know it was all about survival particularly at Dunkirk but I'm talking about every man for himself against fellow soldiers against allies against civilians,0.111925945
I mean after this movie if you saw a British soldier you would be like,0.18499322
I don't know if I'd make it out of this encounter alive because that person is all that for himself,0.39327672
and I realized that there might be some soldiers like that but to to say that all soldiers are that way,0.078364596
I think it's really a disservice to the incredibly heroic and kind majority of soldiers that exist which we know because of the stories and the medals and the real stories,0.10964751
this is a fiction,0.15309319
so the fact that it would try and change that narrative to me is really odd,0.057188563
and there were two deaths in the movie in particular that really bothered me you'll know when you see him and actually even made me angry because neither one had to happen,0.15293637
and it shouldn't have happened,0.07896767
they were both just cold human cruelty and selfishness for British soldiers against people it was just crazy,0.6046419
and again this is fiction nolan wrote this and if he's going to portray british soldiers in this manner he better damn well back it up i'm very curious to hear how people feel about this down in the comments who have a military background are currently involved in the military both if you're overseas and if you're an American military person I think in May I'm just I really curious to see what the reaction is because mine was not good,0.39588428
now no one of course wants an Oscar,0.09202309
and he clearly was aiming for Spielberg Cameron territory here to fellow wildly successful directors commercially who were ignored by the Academy until Saving Private Ryan and Titanic but instead because of the flaws that have kept Nolan from being nominated to date and he just can't help himself,0.13215443
you know I'm surprised he wasn't more self-aware to figure out what the problems where it's hard to be,0.13220146
it's hard to do that anyway I think he should have studied Spielberg and Cameron more carefully but instead of going in their direction,0.12430901
he ended up going Mallik Terrence Malick The Thin Red Line specifically mixed with Pixar,0.23965622
and I'm not talking early Pixar I'm talking you know the really obvious Pixar of today that is aggressively bleak and emotionally manipulative like I was watching this movie and I'm like oh I bet this is going to happen now because that would just make this even sadder then I was like,0.24094881
oh yeah I did okay on and till you but you don't cry can you just annoy and it just makes everybody in the movie unlikable,0.34960094
now I'm sure some of you right,0.087071314
now like but I like the thin red line Greg you're horrible why aren't you more self-aware,0.65006936
I know you guys,0.06566393
well some of you we don't want to paint,0.15020278
everybody with the same brush like Nolan does right and that's great I'm glad you like the Thin Red Line,0.10079976
but the film was not successful with mainstream audiences it made just like 36 million dollars domestic and this one will obviously do much better than that because it's a Christian for Nolan movie and it's so well reviewed and has all this Oscar talk we'll get to that in a moment but I do suspect will be one of his least successful because I think that a lot of people in Middle America will not like it,0.2133637
I mean people who like American sniper aren't going to like this movie,0.17945614
I'm sure some of you are like,0.09612618
well I hate it in there,0.5549249
I mean war divides people and we'll see we'll see how in box office dollars,0.29915342
how many people like this really bleak negative portrayal of it with all the heroics isn't sucked out of it and kindness,0.32570094
I also think that it won't be successful just for some other reasons there's hardly any dialogue and oh the dialogue they do have,0.05269974
it's very hard to hear like an remember an interstellar,0.11134675
Michael Caine,0.09128854
he was like I have diseases,0.39146483
we really important to you and like everybody in the theater was like woody say did you understand it that happens for a number of lines here as well although I'm going to get the shout out to the sound design person in a moment,0.08560232
mostly for the vs the the sound effects also we use a nonlinear storytelling device three different stories to take place over different periods of time like a week like two days or something in an hour or a day in an hour and they don't make it very it's very hard to follow,0.025671596
and I don't think it pays off even or not at the end of the movie you're not like,0.15497266
oh,0.046070345
that's why you did that good show,0.06803424
you're like,0.09439483
yeah,0.040847696
you could have just totally got rid of that,0.3500637
and then also let's just again very aggressively bleak and negative,0.1640782
and its portrayal of soldiers,0.11678858
I was also surprised that upend hardly any attention to the civilians who willingly drove their boats their tiny little boats into a war zone,0.24196133
that's the narrative hook for this movie the Dunkirk story Spielberg and Cameron would have recognized this,0.07683743
and you know that's where Nolan messed up I think,0.12354721
and that's why I think it's going to ultimately cost him the Oscar and I will talk to you more about that just a moment when we get to know himself,0.06528007
but interestingly a movie came out just a few months ago called world's finest from the UK as well Chris Nolan's British and not understood that was the angle that was the human interest angle,0.10129062
that's the word of the Dunkirk story and this movie doesn't do that,0.059700433
I think that Spielberg and Cameron would have realized that what you need to do is to get the audience watching the movie to ask themselves they would do such a thing today,0.058645822
let's say the military was like you know whatever country,0.112042576
you're in your government said we have soldiers stranded behind enemy lines and none of our vehicles for some reason are working,0.09466056
we need you to drive your own car and pick up a bunch of them,0.15446158
would you do it,0.05482673
what you know in an active war zone,0.23673065
where you were in mortal danger and from soldiers to - well as you'll see in this,0.14986353
movie but anyway I will say to be fair that this is a stunning,0.10451794
achievement when it comes to the film craftsmanship outside of,0.047106754
storytelling in fact think this is the best that no one has ever achieved in that,0.10800793
regard and I have no doubt that this one will be nominated for numerous,0.06321795
awards particularly in those categories also its IMAX cinematography alone is,0.09860722
revolutionary and if you are going to see this film you would be doing yourself a disservice not to see it in the IMAX format a real IMAX not a fake baby,0.43592745
IMAX I mean it just fills it the whole screen and it's just a breathtaking picture it was truly it was truly an experience in every sense of the,0.09347729
word and I think it gives the movie a lot of leeway especially toward the beginning until you just crumpled under the bleakness of it and the ability to follow the,0.1652798
story,0.023445284
I also feel it Hans Zimmer who I just finished the other day saying has never produced a score that I think is particularly memorable,0.11840693
he does his best work ever here,0.09092003
I mean in fact I think the movie succeeds because of Zimmer score points in who attend with cinematography and Richard Kings sound design specifically the sound effects,0.08835623
it's just a really good trio they do they do amazing work,0.0633843
and then I think for best score back to best score right now I would say that the Oscar you know award season it's going to right now it's between Zimmer and Michael chiquinho for warfare the Planet of the Apes the the work they both do is career-defining,0.19467078
I feel there's a chance that Noland still won't be nominated here though for director I think that could be the case or you'll be nominated and I don't think,0.0723018
I think for sure he won't win unless things get political unless everybody decides that it's time for Nolan to win another Best directing Oscar,0.073856145
but I think this film especially because you have to consider that so many people who are trying to change the voter ship,0.08467306
particularly to the Academy Awards a lot of them are from the greatest generation,0.093763225
I think they would be particularly offended by the way those soldiers are portrayed,0.19178393
and he should have thought of that when it was making the movie how every Weinstein whatever although he's not doing through all these days either available,0.09932985
no one is not just the director but also the writer so it's his fault that the film misses,0.07196974
the mark storytelling lies both in terms of the ability to follow it and also emotional payoff and engagement,0.17679916
so those are the reasons he usually has it nominated so he still has the exact same problem now acting wise,0.084045395
there's nothing Tom Hardy,0.112251736
can't,0.051001165
do,0.03680355
he's just such a profession,0.1778689
it's a joy to watch him work,0.088017754
he's not asked to do much here,0.16265145
I mean this is the kind of role that he could do in asleep and be warned he has a very very small roll back,0.15064263
most people list movie have a very small role and again when they are on screen there's no dialogue for the most part,0.05225937
so you have to look at the actors most of the time and in that regard Hardy's fellow pilot played by Jack Loudoun was really cool looking he had this really old-fashioned bunch of 1940s Michael J Fox look like it was just like you were like oh you don't really see that anymore,0.19575131
I mean he's just perfect for the movie so he just looked great,0.090947285
I really thought he was fantastic,0.13130747
I can't tell you how good of an actor it was because it was gonna have to do very much acting but he was better than Harry Styles,0.11177329
I'm sorry to say because I was really excited about Harry Styles in this movie I was like oh he's gonna be bigger than Justin Timberlake why isn't he in the trailer more I know why he wasn't in the trailer,0.095986456
more,0.04303453
he's not a good actor I never once believed,0.31089434
he was in any real danger or was actually at war especially when he was next to his co-stars,0.15593603
you were like ah those guys seem really just in despair,0.19099288
you know Harry Styles was that he was just told to seem like he was in despair and he was doing the best he could also he played such a despicable human being that if I were his management team I really would have advised him against taking a role I know it's Nolan but I think he did not come out particularly well I mean I his fans will still love him but anyone who's new to Harry Styles would be like that jerk from Dunkirk,0.81092954
ah now I know a lot of you won't be able to resist,0.15166396
seeing this film partially because the number of you won't believe that what I'm saying is true because of Nolan's reputation,0.11815948
in fact when I was walking out of the theater I asked another critic that I've seen it number numerous screenings,0.054248493
I said would you think of the movie he said I liked it of course but it's like like who could dare not love,0.14415787
a Christopher Nolan movie like why add me of course it was was very to me because I hated it so much Emperor's New Clothes kind of a mentality,0.32545102
oh I similar problems with baby driver in fact,0.2421349
and I think if you like baby driver you might like Dunkirk,0.31089434
maybe you know I'll put you in that category as a movie goer in the first 45 minutes of the movie or so are very good because they're so over the technical craftsmanship and so again you're like oh it's pretty good and like it's bad but I could also tell you though that I had plans to see it again on Sunday night,0.15660453
but I cancelled them after seeing the presque reading because I was like I just can't sit through this movie again,0.081948824
but I know that some of you could you've already seen it I've enjoyed it,0.073640205
and I'm sure that many more will enjoy it,0.057049785
but I think many and more will also agree with me,0.03820469
so let's keep it civil,0.07267152
in the comment section down below as we discuss our differing opinions on Dunkirk and also try to see it not just from your perspective,0.08143008
but it's lighted you know from an awards perspective do you think it'll do well during award season and not just because you think it deserves an Oscar but knowing how the Academy votes who votes etcetera the politics of it all try and keep that in mind as well and their history of voting the patterns that have emerged,0.065720774
all right,0.052336596
thank you so much for tuning in and you can check out some more videos,0.09363665
right,0.04255815
now,0.031218953
