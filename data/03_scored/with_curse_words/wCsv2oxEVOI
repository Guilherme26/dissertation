a shoemaking family that absolutely hates music they hate music so much even saying that,0.39399028
music is the reason that their family was cursed many many years ago so the,0.5513756

really really against music in the family and he tries so hard to try to,0.09955585

coming the the animation is stunning I mean this Pixar I mean everyone pretty much,0.15952504
knew that this movie was going to be stunning but it's absolutely gorgeous with the,0.1291767
use of colors when they lay out what the the land of the dead looks,0.11588733
like and is absolutely amazing from the different characters to the skeletons even the little,0.05687942
characteristics that they gave to everyone to make them look different the spirit animals everything,0.1291594

instead of closer to the first week of November which is closer to November 1st,0.03427959
the day is dead but after watching the movie and seeing their really theme of,0.13242893
family and being thankful for what those before you have done and making sure that,0.07012868

the theme of my perseverance like seizing the moment was like a really big deal,0.11509087
in this movie and watching Miguel even though he was a young boy like he,0.24212034
wanted to be a musician he knew that that's what he was destined to do,0.069639556
