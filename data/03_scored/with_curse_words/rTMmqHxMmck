a quiet place is directed by John Krasinski and stars him and his real-life wife,0.20105913
Emily Blunt as a married couple living on their farm trying to keep their family,0.11870911
safe in a world that has now been overtaken by alien creature things and safety,0.2875081
is not guaranteed because that these creatures are all though blind they are incredibly fast,0.1745647
and violent and our hypersensitive to noise basically if you make even the slightest amount,0.3606888
of noise outside of the general nature eco noises that exist day to day these,0.10364176
creatures are going to hear you they're gonna find you and they're going to tear,0.2794804
you apart [Applause] you guys this entire movie I had my popcorn held up to,0.35650104
my face like this and that's for two reasons one for some reason whenever I,0.12722325
watch horror movies thrillers anything where there's tension and anxiety I find it a lot,0.26406524
easier to watch if half of my face is obscured I don't know why I've,0.26005992
always kind of had this thing really and horror movies I'll often watch through fingers,0.24140094
like this but the second reason my popcorn stayed firmly in front of my face,0.2015261
was because you cannot eat popcorn in this movie it's too noisy so the theater,0.17777182
that I watched this movie in was quite small it was about 30 seats maybe,0.06022327
and about half of the people that are watching this movie had popcorn for the,0.092410885
first 20 minutes of the movie it's practically quiet so everyone was kind of sitting,0.1293834
there had their popcorn out Carlita too noisy would wait until there was maybe like,0.16951579
some dialogue or some music and then it was like either the popcorn drink all,0.06276789
the drinks and it would go quiet again and then you put your popcorn down,0.14321062
and I think the reason that this is a testament to how well sound or,0.052922778
lack of sound is utilizing this film is that if you're an audience member and,0.11193104
you feel panic about making noise because the characters on the screen feel panicked about,0.102234736
making noise then that just shows how transported you are into this film so the,0.12540615
film centers around this family about just under a year and a half after these,0.077837214
creatures have invaded I guess and they are still living on their family farm they,0.10260307
communicate mostly via sign language and they've established these safeguards all these signals for emergencies,0.14125308
so they've kind of established some sort of day-to-day way of dealing with these creatures,0.14955798
also the mother Evelyn is pretty heavily pregnant which we'll talk about a little bit,0.1532388
later as well so one of the best parts about this movie is seeing what,0.07260976
steps the parents have taken to create a kind of normal life for their children,0.12631585
and what is obviously a very abnormal situation the children or games but instead of,0.1574471
the little plastic pieces they now play with pieces of fabric or pom-pom type things,0.1399654
they have homework they have family dinners around the dinner table they have created this,0.05659768
kind of normal world for their children and it's the little attention to detail in,0.09314428
these scenes that really brings to life this family and their struggle in this universe,0.14315529
I really love the casting in this film John Emily have amazing chemistry what you'd,0.09313572
expect because they are married in real life but the children in this film are,0.13411197
phenomenal in particular the deaf daughter and the movie Regan is played by an actress,0.15228142
called Millicent Simmons who is deaf in real life and she was absolutely outstanding in,0.15217102
this I've watched interviews with John Krasinski where he said that he insisted that a,0.078921005
deaf actress was cast to play the role of Regan one because he didn't want,0.15222017
somebody pretending to be deaf but two because he really wanted to get a true,0.24178079
sense of what it would be like to be deaf in this world that he,0.4019382
had creatives and I think that really paid off because it does feel very genuine,0.09539923
and the movie another thing that's really interesting which comes from this deaf character is,0.1367565
the difference between quiet and the film end true silence whenever Reagan's on the screen,0.09051982
always see the movie from her point of view they've removed all sound from the,0.10664865
screen so it's completely silent and to me this added an extra layer of tension,0.10141986
because for somebody who was deaf living in a world where noise is so important,0.21326993
it would be so much harder not knowing ie whether you've created noise so if,0.12588498
you accidentally stand on something or not something over you wouldn't even hear that or,0.24106105
likewise if you were near something that was creating noise and you wouldn't be able,0.11628441
to hear it and there's a scene in the movie that really captures that where,0.04793935
there is one of the creatures behind her heavily breathing but she obviously hasn't noticed,0.2215621
it because she can't hear that so let's talk about emily Blunt's character evelyn being,0.08217267
pregnant for a moment i had no problem with the fact that she was pregnant,0.14986533
of anything actually it does provide one of the most tense scenes in the entire,0.09113792
movie my gripe with it was the fact that the film is set for the,0.06221539
most part on day or around day 460 something I think which is about a,0.053694643
year and a half and to these creatures invading and Evelyn's maybe seven months pregnant,0.23693955
which means that she got pregnant after the creatures invaded we see so much of,0.21626125
them putting in these safeguards for their children and really trying to protect themselves in,0.19396746
the future of their kids it didn't feel like a decision that the characters would,0.07374569
have made to me I don't think they would have consciously made the decision to,0.0787582
have a child maybe it wasn't a conscious decision but it feels like it would,0.13678817
would have been some ways of him to avoid that happening I would have preferred,0.127309
that rather than it being de 460 whatever it was say de 180 which means,0.10191061
that Evelyn could have been pregnant prior to this happening and not known about it,0.15461841
or something like that rather than it being a decision that potentially they made consciously,0.10305371
not a flaw with the film by any means just a personal preference for me,0.08041963
it would have made more sense to have it that way there are a couple,0.0630351
of decisions that I didn't like as well in this movie namely something that happens,0.088849485
with John Krasinski's character Lee towards the end of the film and also a revelation,0.012534742
that happens towards the end of the film again not flaws in my opinion just,0.07210039
things that I didn't quite like as much but overall this film I think was,0.08345173
absolutely fantastic it was scary it was tense every single second I cared about this,0.15330338
these characters in this family absolutely want to watch in the movie theatre because I,0.0706086
think the the way that sounds utilized is heightened when you're in that movie theater,0.098447286
situation but differently one to see I really enjoyed it quiet place I'm really excited,0.11418371
to see what John Krasinski does next as a director because I think he has,0.12347263
done a fantastic job with this one I'm giving a quiet place 8.5 out of,0.102569826
