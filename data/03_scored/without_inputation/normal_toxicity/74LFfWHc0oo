I'm not gonna call this a no spoiler or a spoiler review I'm just gonna talk about the movie there might be some things in it that you might consider mild spoilers,0.07007224
no big reveals,0.07527812
but I just want to talk about the movie the way I want to talk about it,0.06045557
so watch it your discretion and if you like watching me do movie reviews make sure you click that subscribe button Star Wars,0.1650055
the last Jedi for me was a very entertaining and very interesting film I've been thinking about it ever since I saw it,0.072585896
and I'm going to go see it again,0.089767955
because it was a movie that I walked out of it going alright,0.093594
I can handle this,0.058653887
and then the more I thought about it,0.052872762
I was like,0.039237767
yeah yeah there was some stuff that they brought to the table with this one that was a little bit different than what I was expecting this could have been easily,0.091085516
a rehash of the Empire Strikes Back or at least heavily inspired by it in ways that the force awakens was heavily inspired by the original Star Wars and every moment that came in this movie where I thought it would go that way the movie just went,0.05381888
nah,0.03427619
Brownlee going over here,0.06024982
you wouldn't expecting that boom,0.17858194
I thought the evolution of all the newer characters was really good,0.05403009
he could to sear a meeting face to face with Luke Skywalker ready to become a Jedi,0.12185729
and what you learn about her is that even though she's happy that she has these Jedi powers,0.10458873
she's also afraid,0.2814486
she doesn't know how to deal with it,0.27709985
she does know how to control it,0.12292047
she doesn't know her backstory of why she has it or who her parents are and a lot of that troubles her and it also troubles,0.121483155
Luke because he's worried that because of these fears it could lead her to easily get swayed by the darkside and he's already dealt with that with kylo Ren he don't want to deal with that again,0.11135112
and kylo Ren man I gotta give him props he brought it in this movie I know people have their concerns about him,0.13298957
but the thing about kylo Ren is you can't look at him like,0.15230057
he's supposed to be the next Vader cuz,0.076270364
he is not this is a guy that is clearly emotional,0.14937712
and he has some issues,0.15205815
because he's had problems with his mentors both in the light side and the dark and he's just very confused,0.14440383
and conflicted about who he's supposed to be with this power,0.059049975
and then they showcase in this movie that there's some kind of special connection between kylo Ren and Rey is almost like a Jedi face time where they can just sense each other and talk to each other when they're not even in the same area and at least some very interesting conversations both want to have a better future,0.09590245
they just want to do it in different ways,0.08928141
and they're both just like come on outside,0.13835238
now you come on my side you come over here you come over here,0.39878595
it's like a big tug of war is going my Jedi little war,0.2558856
literally,0.031167679
there's a scene that feels like a straight-up Jedi tug of war like meanwhile you got poe dameron he's still flying around the best pilot but he's getting a little cocky general Leia has to remind him a few times that look you had done something awesome over,0.31089434
here,0.053441156
the first order was over here with these 10 other people that you weren't noticing and just killed them all so good job,0.800404
and there's this scene that takes place where they're having this big space ballot at the beginning of the movie and I was thinking like oh this is the cool big action show piece they put the begin of the movie to get the action started right away come to find out that this is actually a large part of the entire movie there is a resistance ship,0.07735003
that's pretty much the last of the people in the resistance,0.20691678
and the first order is on them and the resistance is in trouble they're running out of fuel they're running out of power and they even have this new thing where I don't wanna say too much,0.10662678
but there's something that ships always been able to do to get away that this time don't work first order got some newest a new GPS tracking to figure out that even if you get far away from us using certain ways,0.1078873
we got you,0.06527097
and then of course you had Finn he finally wakes up from his coma,0.34316477
the first thing he's doing he's like where's Rahab,0.15417145
he knows that Rey is away,0.18004741
he doesn't want her to come back because he's afraid that she'll get in danger,0.31089434
if she comes back here,0.106465064
so he tries to find her so they can escape and he runs into Rosa's brand new character who thinks that he's trying to get away and at least this whole like Oh crazy dynamics but then they end up becoming a pair that goes on his quest of their own and trying to help everyone out,0.2408049
and let me just say man I freaking love rose I just love her spunk,0.4928623
even though she does what she needs to do she gets her job done,0.11280054
there's just something kind of aura about her that kind of feels like it feels like she won a contest like she won a contest to be in a Star Wars movie like have a walk-on role,0.1115335
but everyone just loved her so much that she now gets to have a major partner movie like a dream come true like,0.104300834
I was just going to be an extra in the background because I found the right piece of my Star Wars cereal,0.06652484
and now I'm a main character in this whole universe baby,0.08413036
but yeah it's really cool to see her character in this and her and Finn get along really well throughout,0.08719283
the course of the movie nice a lot of the time together,0.107834056
so it makes sense you also get a little bit of story about her sister as well which is very quick,0.15093873
but it's very powerful like this one character,0.060519096
her sister probably has more emotion than some of the characters who are in the entire movie which is her,0.15344156
one seed,0.0747439
oh and Finn brings it this time man hello jokey jokey,0.38514218
I'm gonna run away you got a boyfriend,0.48259053
he is the fan I worn it like he even does something at the end of this movie towards it into this movie that I was like damn fan you have,0.6050543
grown,0.0437619
Randy Quaid would be proud,0.18729672
hey stormtroopers,0.09002302
I'm back the only character I've never really been big on his general hooks that fleece hasn't even gotten more and more out there,0.11291514
but what I like about the movie is that even in the movie nobody likes general Hux this dude is slapped around throwing across the place made fun of,0.29384017
and now I like him more for the fact that no one in the movie treats him seriously,0.11705455
but the classic characters are here too,0.048066087
and they're not forgotten,0.10699408
and what I like about this movie is that they're not just there for fanservice and nostalgia they actually try to do some evolution with some of the classics like Luke Luke you would just think it's gonna come in as the obi-wan role and just do his thing so that Rey could be the next Jedi and that's it nah man,0.10997569
Luke got some backstory,0.05963141
that's a little like dude what and it kind of could also have been the reason why all the stuff we're dealing with now is happening,0.06307296
and he always regrets that I thought that was kind of cool and what's interesting about the story is one of those stories that you get to hear a couple of times in the movie and you can hear it from different perspectives,0.0500253
so you see how each person feels about that moment and how it looked to them,0.06800619
and why they are acting the way,0.051298816
they act,0.07045167
now because of what happened in their mind at that moment and lay a man Leia she's badass Leia has gone full general and she also reminds you real quick remember I'm a Skywalker,0.31089434
- I know Luke got all these,0.04880515
powers but let Lamport out of power I was like,0.066979565
damn I didn't even know Jedi could do that you thought you've seen everything that the force could do this movie is like,0.73491997
nah we got some advanced level courses of,0.05244544
force some advanced force courses that you need know about and you bout to get a lesson son they got me two,0.15669069
minutes I'm moment in this movie I don't to give too much of my boarded that tear was about to come down because I smell something about to happen and in that movie was like nah nah suck that tear right back up you,0.65248424
cool you cool everything's good everything's good and Luke - boy Luke does something with his,0.05921892
Jedi powers I was like damn Luke,0.60515624
doesn't thing whereas like you got this one time you'll never see me do,0.16632491
it again but when I did it this one time I hope you,0.08629488
enjoyed it and I was like I did I did Luke,0.053549062
good job,0.054077614
but I tell you who I think really has a force in a ray and ain't kylo Ren it's freaking bb-8 bb-8 is like Opie robot,0.40473697
this droid can pretty much do anything,0.15633266
it is really the Swiss Army knife of Android especially towards the end man bb-8 does something,0.26050794
I was like what can't you do people talking about Rey being over power,0.18735479
uh-huh bb-8 people throw bb-8 in this movie like they throw him,0.45994797
he should break apart,0.15069015
he's just like bounce like a freakin gummy bear like,0.6710843
oh,0.046070345
oh my head fell out,0.17788512
let me just go grab that real quick okay kill bb-8,0.6649681
bb-8 is a terminator y'all baby,0.35141435
is gonna come back in time and kill John Connor and we're gonna be ruled in the future by bb-8,0.6523083
and that's the wrong I'm okay with living in as always the action is always on point in these movies the space battles are good the lightsaber bat,0.16412379
oh the lightsaber there is a lightsaber battle in this movie that is so awesome man,0.086218774
they even do something with a ship in this movie that was like oh man,0.15539482
I never would have thought about doing that with a ship in Star Wars,0.065252885
but when they do it it is so awesome,0.050172538
it is so awesome that the movie just stops doing sound it's just like hey Nelson all right,0.056724407
on the final act of this movie or the final battle in this movie it's really cool,0.067586385
it's not a Death Star this time it's def storage but at least it's on the ground this time,0.093045756
so we get a ground fight there on this salt planet or this planet we're like the white part,0.28214002
it turns red so it has this nice visual to it,0.10977634
it was worth it,0.092921264
we get some new creatures of course they're cute and adorable some of them received you guys,0.15331385
some of them are practical some are mixture of both the poor you're not annoying,0.15185815
I was really happy,0.048857488
I was really worried about the pores,0.0430911
I'm like these become the Star Wars,0.062139492
minions I'ma be a little bit upset but they're actually really kind of cute,0.17683977
I love the arctic fox things a little like Crystal,0.12952375
foxes,0.2401744
those were awesome,0.04068496
there are some other creatures,0.060674652
are,0.030010587
like,0.02861636
yeah,0.040847696
you know,0.07163658
they're okay some of them are there for jokes and humor,0.14727694
there's a lot of humor in this movie a lot more than I would've expected,0.084944196
it's not like the Star Wars Comedy Hour or anything but definitely more humor and more direct humor than you would probably expect from something like Star Wars,0.11325259
so for some people that might be a bit hard to swallow,0.45895365
some of the jokes I think did work though some don't but some like there's this whole scene that takes place in the casino and I know some people who have been really harping on this part,0.075681016
I think it's the worst,0.2805999
I think there's some stuff and then it works some things that don't work,0.07724631
they get a little silly in there it gets a little jokey-joke,0.464148
but at the same time I got a mic Sega Star Wars Casino I just thought I was gonna meet and you know what got me,0.05894054
and it's the lamest thing in the world,0.3677701
and I should put this as a bad but it was good for me,0.28724298
there's a character that literally in this movie is one of those rich snobs people with the little tiny mustache and the white suit and the lapel he just goes loving anybody ever says love me like that I'm like all right,0.4156822
I know I should not like you cuz that's cheap but I do but like I said the big thing I can give credit for this movie is it is not predictable at all all of you that created your Star Wars theories blogs and videos and everything that you've created for the past couple of years about what you think is gonna happen,0.17321144
with Rey's parents,0.04294497
if kind of rids gonna go full Vader the origins of Snoke all that stuff you just might as well delete it just file delete cuz this movie in there takes it a direction you never even thought it would take or it just goes man,0.28087848
that's not important,0.14951663
you thought that was going to be important in a sorry sorry did you waste your time,0.35241643
she just went to the movie came out like everyone else,0.17183802
did that's your fault,0.3543478
one of the biggest problems,0.15307783
I have with the movie is that all the carriers that I like are split up so Rey has her thing going on with Luke Finn and Rose have their thing going on Poe has his thing going on with Leia,0.083901644
and then kylo Ren kind of pops in with Ray every once in a while and I get why they did that because they have,0.10356218
so many different things going on with this story,0.04538805
but one of the things that made the force awakens work for me was I loved the chemistry between Finn and Poe,0.06550453
I love the chemistry between Finn and Rey the fact they're mostly split up for this entire film,0.11552304
you kind of miss it a little bit,0.18317246
that's why I'm glad they had been Andros together because they kind of brought back that chemistry that I was expecting based on what I saw with Rey and Finn and Finn and Poe in the force awakens plus their plot points aren't even they're all good storylines but some get a little bit more detail than others,0.10588278
some are put on the screen a little bit more than others,0.09544992
because we get back and forth like five or six times of Luke being like I'm not gonna train you rain,0.059736222
I'm like do we know you're gonna train us just go ahead and do it we already keep coming back here for you to say no,0.1569372
and there's some things that happen with poet it made sense,0.052722014
there was a couple times I was like you probably could have just had a conversation with him Laura Dern and then we probably gotten this all cleared up meanwhile Finn and Rose are sort of establishing this relationship as a duo together it kind of gets established through dialogue,0.06836191
but I think we would have been nice to see more of it,0.06668136
they kind of get a little excited when they get that Casino is like all,0.08361335
the CGI listen looking at that we got to do all this stuff to make it all fun,0.09689091
and I get it because the kids are coming to you gotta give some to the kids,0.13150516
but I love those two characters together and I think they were establishing something great with them,0.05442565
and so I wish that their story was beat up a little bit more the movie is fine with its link,0.14924893
but I think it could have either been a little bit tighter or it could have just balanced out a little bit more you balanced out the force,0.18521945
let's balance out the plot points,0.06933484
and there is a character that casino,0.06476013
I was like come on y'all,0.24162635
that's a leprechaun don't go back to that I'm not going in there with two Jedi Knight type of Star Wars characters,0.13798179
okay we do that in the prequels don't do that again,0.088885985
the movie has a mix of practical effects and CGI effects which is fine,0.060410738
but that just means that some of the CG eyes don't look really CGI when you see it but I gotta give them props man because there's something,0.093882665
they could've done CGI that has been done CGI before that wasn't CGI before that,0.061677452
and they couldn't CGI again,0.059521336
and they chose instead to go back to practical,0.058507785
and I was like wow that's bold and some of the lessons that they try to put in this movie are a little heavy-handed,0.15337865
they try to do some things about the rich living off the poor the casino scene there's a whole talk about weapons and how they're handled on both sides,0.11760815
and it's like nah man,0.10177524
I get it,0.065855
you want to put your lessons in there but a little on the nose poor captain phasma man it's like she just had such a great outfit and a great demeanor and you just wanting her to shine she gets like a scene,0.4032599
it's a really good scene,0.1088824
but it's a scene Acy but at least captain phasma does better than Maz Kanata little Lupita Nyong'o they need to get rid of her CGI character and just make her a character in the movie like the actress not only is she in one scene she's like in like a little viewing globe like we're in the freakin Power Rangers command center,0.48804855
and we're watching Zords globe and she's in there like hey I'm gonna tell you some exposition and then I'm out I'm off the Black Panther seriously like is she like going to cocoon and like metamorphosis Maz Kanata going to cocoon and come out as Lupita Nyong'o as a human can we just do that do that in episode 9,0.23993178
and now for the nerdy is Star Wars done and I'm pretty sure there's gonna be some hardcore Star Wars fan boys,0.33826584
they're not gonna like this movie because some characters gonna not gonna do the things they thought they were gonna do some storylines not gonna go the way they thought,0.08759951
they were gonna go,0.06333928
their fanfiction is completely ripped up and shredded and burned and to that I say who needs your 3d glasses when you got nostalgic goggles you like the movie fine if you don't find these are my opinions is how I feel I enjoyed it wish it could've been structured a little bit tighter but I still enjoy what I saw,0.36484516
but what I really respect about it is a movie that made me think,0.095700614
and it's a movie that I want to see again,0.09232837
because it made me think so much and that is not something I would have expected from Star Wars The Force awakens was more of the funnest I'll just throw back,0.078958735
this is more of a thinking man Star Wars for me,0.09585396
and I appreciate that they went in that direction,0.058080897
so those are my thoughts about Star Wars,0.06532605
let me know what your thoughts,0.101741046
