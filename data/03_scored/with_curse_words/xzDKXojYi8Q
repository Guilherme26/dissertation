seeing as Star Wars is a huge franchise and has been since the late 70s,0.04874037
I decided this is not going to be a typical review and more of a,0.08192476
spoilery discussion I mean let's be honest it's Star Wars you already made up your,0.15099718
mind whether or not you're going to see this so yeah if you don't want,0.2371705
any spoilers I suggest you wait until after you watch the movie before you watch,0.18151872
this review if that doesn't bother you then let's jump right in you hey that,0.24172041
movie chick here and today I'm reviewing Star Wars Episode eight the last Jedi my,0.28362736
parents were fairly big fans of Star Wars so it was something I definitely was,0.07572822
exposed to heavily as a child my thoughts I only really rewatched him her Strikes,0.4146657
Back and the terrible Ewok spin-offs yeah I was that weird kid I don't think,0.35563996
I can ever fully explain how far back or how deep my love for bad,0.1808619
80s films goes I sure the sentiment was my mom of course is she's the,0.18159895
one who had the Ewok movies recorded on VHS there's nothing wrong with the new,0.16307251
Hofer even to a lesser extent returned the Jedi stars just wasn't something that shaped,0.24066836
my childhood the way it did for others so yeah fast forward to 10-year old,0.15099911
me when the first prequel the Phantom Menace premiered I hated it well most of,0.24223422
it I love the costumes duel the faith scene was pretty legit it introduced me,0.15049013
to you McGregor in Le Portman who I am big fans of even to this,0.10291848
day I ended up liking Attack of the Clones more only because the cringy love,0.30956155
scenes are marginally more tolerable to me than the boring politic scenes from Phantom Menace,0.41333088
I'll take a bad CW twin show over boring session of c-span any day also,0.24207194
you can't go wrong with you McGregor at a beard one of my first big,0.2960904
celebrity crushes in high school Revenge of the Sith was the best out of three,0.22558406
only because your expectations are lowered so much anything is better at this point honestly,0.31419954
the first act is fun the third act has an amazing fight sequence and some,0.10434571
great emotional punches mostly from you McGregor and Natalie Portman gets the best line in,0.1951598
the entire prequel trilogy [Applause] thunderous applause I just wish George Lucas would have relinquished,0.085795894
control just a bit and let someone more competent at least help write the dialogue,0.095386565
in the story with him and apparently my prayers were answered when he did just,0.027001008
that he signed over his cash cow to Disney and in 2015 we were given,0.07472076
the force awakens I thoroughly enjoyed it it had a great cast some badass scenes,0.33736628
jokes hit and I'll give it a pass for all the nostalgic callbacks and basic,0.1557485
copy and pasting from a new hope because I understand why JJ Abrams had to,0.05855834
prove to everyone that not only could he bring Star Wars back but engage both,0.05131404
new and old fans though I will admit I was initially happy to hear someone,0.08916566
else taking over for the next installment we need fresh ideas and for someone to,0.068869546
breathe life into this franchise JJ irbaz isn't a terrible director per se but South,0.18382953
Park wasn't really exaggerating when they say he only uses member berries the new Star,0.15091619
Wars was not as good as everyone thought it was it may seem fun to,0.09339623
go back and recycle the past we loved but we end up with no sustenance,0.11710869
I thought you're gonna explain why people want a guy like me to be President,0.16996975
well that's important too I guess but it's just a symptom of the same thing,0.06359008
he makes movies at a pier nostalgia and more often than not forgets to shake,0.13697684
things up and try something new so the last Jedi was handed over to Rian,0.054677676
Johnson director of brick a film I liked and looper a film were Joseph gordon-levitt's,0.057362128
prosthetics gave me nightmares so how does the last Jedi fair then the last Jedi,0.28789952
has a fun first act in a thrilling third act the fight scenes from the,0.15444024
last movie are amped up to 11 here there was an especially cool fight scene,0.13174577
between kylo Ren and Rey against the Praetorian Red Guards I felt he even rivaled,0.19502707
the badass Vader fight from rogue one yeah it was that kind of awesome there,0.35152885
are some really gorgeous shots in this film especially in the third act when they're,0.14775108
fighting on the salt planet I would say the mo just emotionally gripping scene for,0.1724719
me was all done by an on character I wasn't expecting it and then realizing,0.090030365
it was clearly a setup for the new character Rose but I'll take it kylo,0.078029394
Ren has only gotten even more engaging and cooler to me here I don't care,0.17386124
what anyone says he was one of the best parts and force awakens and that's,0.10198373
no different here in fact the better dramatic moments all belong to him in his,0.16100588
interactions with Rey Mark Hamill's return was much more improved than that of Harrison Ford,0.11967286
who walked around with the face of a man who was only there for a,0.1426101
paycheck he puts his all into his performance and doesn't hold back it felt like,0.058986787
he never left which gave me a fuzzy feeling the lovely Carrie Fisher is here,0.10230255
in her last film role and she couldn't have picked a better one to go,0.08360146
out on Oscar Isaac gets more to do and show off his talents as more,0.12817818
than just a simple charming ace pilot also bb-8 manages to remain just as adorable,0.11392243
and hilarious as he was in the first movie alright you ready because I need,0.14941928
to address what I didn't like about this movie there were so many nlgger cutesy,0.3741524
creatures in this film for anyone who complained about baby Groot or the Ewoks you,0.26769817
will die from the cuteness overload in this movie at first from the trailers I,0.3745711
thought I was just going to endure like maybe one or two scenes of those,0.083374366
puffins which basically looked like what happens when you squeeze your cat's face but they,0.30511507
don't leave they overtake many scenes with Ray and Luke on luck I'm sorry this,0.075391605
island clearly looks like they stopped filming the Highlander just so they could film a,0.13876756
Star Wars scene here and even when I thought I had escaped those little cat,0.08161113
penguins they just get replaced immediately with nlgger icicle foxes and yes while the icicle,0.5867229
foxes did have more bearing to the plot was it really necessary to crowd every,0.23986223
scene with them Russell's a gross aliens wears the ugly-ass Tontons that sound like dying,0.90142363
camels I'm really not exaggerating here it gets to a point where the main story,0.08853674
is hijacked by a subplot including big fluffy creatures that are being mistreated which speaking,0.2789873
of the main plot as is was good enough and could fill a whole run,0.13885547
time why the need to bak it down you got lay on the rebels fighting,0.3918901
to survive and escape from the clutches from the first order while ray goes to,0.05821214
seek help from the last remaining Jedi Luke Skywalker thrilling stuff right but then late,0.09380928
gets put out of commission and one of the strangest scenes I've ever had to,0.16326916
sit through in a Star Wars movie and that's saying something so in comes Laura,0.08896246
Dern with very purple hair it felt less alien and more like watching a woman,0.31806588
going through a midlife crisis Paul and Finn decide they don't like Laura Dern are,0.09925233
her plan so then a new annoying character rose set off to find the codebreaker,0.23974778
only to get sidetracked when they stumble onto the movie set of okhta and tried,0.105550215
to rescue some animals instead like I get it movie I get that you wanted,0.18498817
to show both sides of the coin that there's good and evil on both sides,0.16351388
except you never go far enough with that concept more on that later so yeah,0.2407495
then gets fuck-all to do in this movie his characterization comes to a screeching halt,0.9324011
and his subplot goes nowhere and is ultimately pointless in the end this movie doesn't,0.21188514
even allow him to engage in his many fight scenes and comedy bits which is,0.14891931
something he excelled in the force awakens he is completely wasted here and his new,0.17513435
sidekick slash shoehorned in love interest Rose is just bland her said it was interesting,0.29195416
and why she decided to help the heroes made sense but she mostly speaks in,0.07988109
made-up sci-fi jargon about technology I don't know or care about so she's basically a,0.13555938
Star Trek character without the charm she's just very preaching and consistent meanwhile as all,0.095666245
this nlgger is happening raised bucking around on a planet switching between her back-and-forth with,0.35974848
Luke or kylo Ren it is nowhere near riveting as the training subplot and Empire,0.053083163
but damn if los daddy doesn't try its darndest she basically just trains herself and,0.8470924
learns nothing new on the island from Luke they basically have the same conversation over,0.05786006
and over again the second act is the worst section of this movie it drags,0.32151914
its feet and clunk Lee goes through every storyline without being able to balance any,0.09108438
of it out there is so much that could have been cut down I hadn't,0.107715614
felt the length of a Star Wars movie since Phantom Menace but you know who,0.07356466
should have gotten more screen time instead Wendelin nlgger Christie have you guys learned nothing,0.46252218
from force awakens you don't hire brand of ptarth and not user she's clearly here,0.1265057
as a substitute for Boba Fett and she could have been a great one if,0.24235438
they actually put her in the movie she has even less screen time than Fett,0.38620624
how was it even possible she gets two scenes accompanied by a lazy Disney death,0.5899174
she would have been an appropriate subplot in catalyst for Finn as a means for,0.13705848
him to overcome his stormtrooper past and his insecurities about who he needs to become,0.11018413
there was no need to kill her off so soon what a waste of a,0.794439
great actress I don't know the scripts to blame or the new director both but,0.11108795
yet the acting in this is not very stellar here the actors were struggling the,0.10350556
jokes they they just went flying man apart from bb-8 little skits I found myself,0.2503507
sighing or cringing away from the screen there is a scene where Luke Skywalker drinks,0.115555815
gross green alien milk from a strange creatures utters it will never leave my brain,0.5005803
and I'm pretty sure it will haunt my dreams for the rest of my life,0.1643165
though Mr Cable does manage to breathe some life into these lines the director seems,0.08358044
to be working against him on it when you're first introduced to him rave returns,0.13003361
his lightsaber just like at the end of the force awakens and Mark Hamill with,0.11782839
a straight face Chuck's the laser sword off a cliff I actually started chuckle until,0.6364068
I realized the music and Daisy Ridley were playing this off so seriously it squashed,0.25733143
the joke before could ever actually take off and that's just the tip of the,0.11206003
iceberg in this film there is no balance or proper placing of the jokes in,0.05761612
juxtaposition to the more dramatic scenes of this film seems that should be tenser sad,0.093527064
or interrupted by crappy one-liners or lame gags being crammed in like after Poland the,0.5115668
rebels barely survived an attack from the first order then wakes up leaking this weird,0.26413685
fluid everywhere from his plastic bubble suit seriously movie you just made me watch all,0.20286776
these casualties and you stop it all for a lame sight gag I understand films,0.40027347
need levity but not to the point that it disrupts the pivotal moments I won't,0.18352881
be putting the entire blame on the last Jedi as it's a pattern of notice,0.15033005
with many movies of today I was quite fond of Daisy Ridley's performance in force,0.07098657
awakens all the complaints of her being a Mary Sue I thought were unfounded as,0.077904105
she was no different than that of Luke from a new hope she was a,0.081680275
pretty good role model for young girls and she was successful in both the light-hearted,0.057729665
moments as well as the more darker and emotional scenes I was definitely excited to,0.059472196
see how they would further her character development in the next installment and does she,0.07668673
a short answer she doesn't not really the long answer I had the same problem,0.104714796
here that I did with her performance in the Murder on the Orient Express Daisy,0.40320483
Ridley is young and is still paving her way in acting she has still yet,0.09495017
to convince me of really showcasing a darker side of herself I did not buy,0.18794072
for one second that she could be so easily swayed by evil she's to doe-eyed,0.5023725
and her version of anger is screaming like mice little sister when she was five,0.4402964
years old it's not always her fault she was jealous some really bad dialog like,0.24067062
when she's first taught to feel the force they use really heavy-handed metaphors like her,0.17868568
dialogue is way too on-the-nose she has to say things like I feel death in,0.3130507
life and light and dark the dark side is even symbolized by a literal dark,0.15584916
giant hole in the ground when I said I really enjoyed her scenes with kylo,0.64564276
Ren it wasn't really because of Daisy Ridley it was because of Adam driver he,0.106767245
carries their scenes and I'm sorry he just has the better more complex performance let,0.1113487
me put it this way Daisy really is not so much like Sarah Michelle Gellar's,0.18182512
Buffy but more like Kirstie Swanson's Buffy then we'll be completely cops out on giving,0.101915576
her a more intriguing and darker storyline the movie constantly hints and teases that she,0.112777546
might turn to the dark side in that they'll pull switcheroo and kylo Ren will,0.0941225
turn to the light however it's almost as if a Disney executive saw this and,0.0846057
when wait we won't be able to sell toys to young impressionable little girls of,0.2974968
Rey turns evil cut that out doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense as long,0.24148303
as it's predictable that killed the momentum of this character rape for me she truly,0.5647805
transformed into a Mary Sue here and it really made me sad to admit that,0.06828597
I said I gave force awakens a pass for all its nostalgic winks and nods,0.09106822
but the last Jedi is at its weakest when it's copying the other films most,0.1520974
evidently and purr strikes back it tries to recapture the battle scene on Hoth the,0.11979682
training sequences from Endor however they should have learned from JJ Abrams as past mistakes,0.1193392
with Star Trek and that you need to leave classics well enough alone there are,0.085517175
a handful of pandering scenes that actually do work here r2d2 is the one who,0.18449047
convinces Luke to help the rebels by showing him an old hologram of Princess Leia,0.15783224
back from a new hope and when Luke decides to destroy the old Jedi Temple,0.14473757
on the not Highlander island Yodas ghost shows up to give them some sagely advice,0.06622653
and it actually works however most of the time it just feels like they're copying,0.103794076
pasting what worked from impressed it's back and even force awakens and just writing off,0.051612012
their coattails in the end it came off more like a hot mess similar to,0.33756375
return the Jedi than anything else there are so many character arcs and storylines that,0.049839176
are either dropped entirely or rendered completely moot Benicio del Toro please the Code Breaker,0.15084967
that Benin Rose had to find not only does the storyline drag I mean it,0.07943086
felt like an eternity in that nlgger casino but when he actually gets her into,0.24129845
helping them he immediately be traced them in the next scene so yeah that plan,0.11810932
meant nothing to really rub it in your face Pope finds out Lauren actually had,0.22755995
her a brilliant plan on how to save the rebels by using cloak transports to,0.15145949
get to a salt planet which of course ends up nlgger up because of their,0.53640187
nlgger of having the codebreaker who led to a betrayal of knowing where the transports,0.409579
were good job heroes roses Ark makes no sense either her sister the non character,0.15291621
with the cool motional scene she sacrifices herself to save the rebels which in turn,0.19124354
moves rose to become a better rebel hero except in the end she stupidly stops,0.7686623
Finn from sacrificing himself in order to stop a first-order weapon from killing all the,0.64149714
rebels because she loves him now I guess and yeah they tried to shoehorn in,0.26481363
that she learned some lesson that I've learned not to kill what I hate but,0.48935196
save what I love except you know she's pretty much doomed to all the rebels,0.69542736
if it wasn't for Luke luckily just sauntering in disable other asses they would have,0.7688739
all been dead she didn't know that he was on his way there to help,0.40324256
so she basically acted out of selfish desire and did not really learn from her,0.324762
sister sacrifice ray on the not Highlander planet learns nothing come look his lessons are,0.27212575
basically just chastising her and telling her about how the Jedi faith is good and,0.062858015
dead he's a failure and she's too easily seduced by the dark side up apparently,0.65109605
they never shown me this but they do like telling me a lot oh and,0.091937244
that he doesn't believe in the force anymore or something it brought me back to,0.12195514
one favorite TV shows penny dreadful Marceau - my favorite episode in season 2 Ava,0.10613885
Graham portrays Vanessa a young woman with mysterious powers who was constantly fighting being seduced,0.15153798
by the literal devil because if she does the world will end and humanity will,0.60467386
be doomed desperate and afraid she seeks the teachings of the cut wife Joan Clayton,0.23361966
who was more than resistant to helping her in fact she makes her stand outside,0.05774033
in the cold rain for three days before deeming her worthy it's a great episode,0.116387084
with some brief moments of levity brilliant gut punches of drama as we follow the,0.11600287
Nessa being taught not only how to utilize her powers but is heavily warned to,0.1527445
never use her darkness or it will swallow her up and you believe it too,0.41280073
now I realize that this is an r-rated TV show that has more time to,0.08207477
develop its characters but it managed to pull this off in one episode with this,0.083606526
entire movie never could all these plot lines go absolutely nowhere except for kylo ren's,0.101759516
watching his descent into madness is not only fascinating but it was at times heart-wrenching,0.17425017
early on he gets a chance to kill his own mother and he doesn't take,0.7680866
it he hesitates and the wastes no belittle him for having conflict in his heart,0.2412093
and still carrying feelings for those from his past till the point that kylo just,0.06148279
straight up de sizeable I guess I gotta cut everyone out of my life and,0.5876557
by cut them out I mean literally to ribbons and when you finally get his,0.48495305
backstory with Luke you really feel the emotion and less sorrow between those two I,0.10108067
wish Mark Hamill and Adam driver had more scenes together as they were both the,0.09178868
sole saving graces of this movie Adam trigger also had some pretty decent chemistry with,0.10282135
Daisy Ridley and I wish they had further developed that instead of just copping out,0.100537285
and just placing the black hat on him and the white hat on her it's,0.23737143
truly heartbreaking that Carrie Fisher has left us as a person she was someone to,0.09341807
be admired someone who survived and never allowed herself to become a victim and always,0.31089434
stayed true to herself and said what she thought and her arc in this movie,0.083830066
they had more than enough chances to end it on a high note instead they,0.06016994
have this unintentionally uncomfortable scene where she gets blown out into space and we see,0.15635227
her floating around is what we assume is her corpse and then out of nowhere,0.43777543
she magically flies like Superman into a surviving ship and has a short-term coma as,0.24236718
a result they temporarily replace her with laura dern who ultimately sacrifices herself and the,0.25461516
most badass usage of CG in this movie she uses Lightspeed to slice through the,0.3989443
enemy fleet it was awesome it made me think of only hindsight or in 2020,0.1851107
and instead of laura dern they used carrie fisher for this ultimate sacrifice instead no,0.1422424
instead the classic character they decide to kill off this time is luke kind of,0.40367696
reminded me of the Dark Knight and they're on fortunate switcheroo so yeah Luke astral,0.0661994
projects himself does some badass stuff then acts out one of his popular early scenes,0.2543613
from New Hope and vanishes into the force the rebel base is saved by him,0.0681667
and Rey everyone celebrates kylo Ren has now taken over the first order and the,0.06143278
movie just kind of ends on a Rando kid we met briefly and to show,0.11055991
that he has Jedi powers the end the ending didn't quite have as much of,0.093127914
a punch as Empire Strikes Back did or even attack of the clones for that,0.2715336
matter I don't have any pressing questions the same way I did after the force,0.07748325
awakens now that I've watched it go a very predictable route they I mean they,0.074630864
already gave up Rey's parents as scumbags who sold her off for drug money or,0.8606264
something which would have been an interesting thing to bring up in the movie that,0.07139229
she has no place here but they just kind of say it and move on,0.24862367
so another wasted element in this movie meanwhile kylo has really turned to the dark,0.15477116
side Rey is pretty much taken Luke's place and with that little kid at the,0.10771313
end it's heavily imply that we're going to see more people who are one with,0.07277958
the force and that clearly the Jedi are not indeed extinct there were no real,0.08786065
loose ends here not any that I actually cared about anyway all in all this,0.16846316
film could have been a great one it had so many good ideas and interesting,0.071481645
themes with grey morality but the execution is beyond amateurish the dialogue is too on-the-nose,0.14992158
and void of real human quality no balance between the humor and drama the whole,0.24093471
movie was a jerky roller coaster ride that didn't know how to properly build up,0.21318766
two scenes or characters so do I hate this movie no what I watch it,0.27815452
again when it's available in streaming sites I'll give it a go and just watch,0.065888286
my favorite parts and that's the most frustrating element about this movie when it's good,0.12477533
it's nlgger amazing but when it's bad it's god-awful and just cringe II this is,0.3128137
a rentable movie for me at best I really hope they get their nlgger together,0.41065377
and end this new trilogy on a high note well that's my review I hope,0.19516283
you enjoyed it if you did please subscribe to my channel and like this video,0.1988584
