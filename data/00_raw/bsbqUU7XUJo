what our peeps Tony Baker here back with another movie review this time I'm reviewing spider-man into the spider verse it's a dope little animated concept a Spider Man and this is Spider Man this miles morales in comic books they always do alternate universes all the time that way they can always change the narrative they can add new characters keep the character the same but make a little tweak on them and then you don't have to restart anything else in the main universe so spider-man Miles Morales is a kid from New York now in this reality okay Peter Parker just died spider-man and so this is kid from New York Miles Morales who is bitten by a radioactive spider big surprise he's in viewed with the powers as well this time he has a tweak on his powers he has a slow electric burst that he can do any could turn invisible Miles Morales New York kid you know I'm saying black and Latino he's just in New York you know say which is very New York to have a a biracial kid in New York City that's this very realistic so Peter Parker dies and then there's interdimensional gate that's open switches everything up so now Peter Parker from a different dimension shows up and miles is dimension and so it's like the Peter Parker that let himself go him and Mary Jane split up so he's just like you know he's gonna show him the ropes on being spider-man in his reality but he still got to get Peter Parker back to his original reality it's kind of confusing but it's not really it's very easy to follow when you watch it but when you sit here and listen to me tell us you're probably like what not only that there's other spider people from different dimensions that show up as well so it's a whole bunch of spider people they show up and they're like yo we got to get back cuz if they stay and miles is I don't know how you say miles in poor form if they stay in his dimension they'll end up dying so it's like we got to get you guys back you know that's the and so that's pretty much what the movies about and it's also you know miles coming to grip with you know I'm the spider-man how do i how do I adjust to this new life you got a spider ham in there the new are spider-man just like anime spider girl things so it's all kind of different spider people coming together for this one mission in this dope it's like a different concept the animation is something I've never seen before and it looks like it's it looks like it's supposed to be 3d you know a 3d movies look when you got the glasses off and you could tell like are they daddy's on it kind of looks like that except it's easier to see and then when you watch it in 3d it's pretty much dope to it feels very current very fresh very with the times Myles is young you know a smart kid you know the main and so all of that works and then the original Peter Parker is coming to show them the ropes and everything works it's like you know you care about spider-man spider-man is somebody that you always want to see done well okay even the bad spider-man 3 that was horrible everybody still wanted more spider-man it's not like they just give up nobody ever said just give up on spider-man know you've like all right let's try to get you always willing to try it again and I think this animated step is very fresh and dope and I'm glad they didn't send it just straight to DVD well a lot of people overlook oh it's a good time man there's a good time at the theater it was funny you cared about the characters I was just dope to see the action was cool the Jordans were fresh you know what I mean and that was dope to see as well one of the takeaways from this is the Stanley effect know we all know he just passed so it was like man if he shows up in this movie will we fold up cuz Stanley had an amazing run 95 years old with love you know just brought so much joy to so many people so when you see us my home and he's in this so you know be ready for that another takeaway is I don't always wonder like who's cleaning up the spiderwebs in the in the city spider spider man's been web slinging all throughout the city who's cleaning that up what happens to the spider where do they dissolve after certain time because in real life spiders are messy as hell and I'm sick oh they don't clean up they make spider webs in your house and you're calling all your ceilings whatever and they just leave them in like packages when you get across reel it back in take it with you you don't say this very is very selfish the spiders a Spider Man is just as selfless he's webbing up the whole city I'd never see him cleaning it up I've never seen that I want to see him my art sorry guys pulling it off the wall because in real life you'd be spider webs everywhere man spider-man saving the day with Jesus its webs all over the place I don't want answers on that front man and in real life spiders if you're watching my YouTube page real spiders clean your  up man sick of y'all out here just leaving the way I'm walking through them every night in the summertime no regard for nobody but yourselves and your meal I'll tell you this if I see a bug get trapped in your web like right I see it happen I'm saving that book just just out of spite cuz I'm like you wrong for not cleaning up after yourself and then when they leave the food behind the disrespect of the food left you don't even finish the carcass you drink the insides then you leave the whole carcass posted up in the kitchen in the ceiling sick of y'all man anyway y'all want to know the smooth jazz review let's fight a man into the spider-verse would hear it I'm giving spider-man into the spider-verse four saxophones out of five ah but the spiderwebs oh man for real if I turn around what if I turned around into the spider with would they be there to clean it up problem alright peeps that's my review of spider-man into the spider verse if you like spider-man of course spider-man 2 she's probably my favorite with Doc Ock and
