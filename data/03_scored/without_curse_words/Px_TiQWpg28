cars are sent out on this mission and we learned that furiosa is a traitor,0.50703317

these women um yeah this movie is pretty something special this is this is not,0.4032081
a movie that gets made right now it is weird it is action II and,0.059624083
let me let me like specify this movie is very very very weird um like,0.14528239
when I saw this I I I honestly don't know how mainstream audiences are going,0.09954696
to react to this because like in the trailer trailers there's a lot of action,0.06700032
but like they have touched on none of the weirdness like this movie has some,0.17881194
weird disturbing kind of gross in it and it's awesome I love it it's fantastic,0.34980837
if you love mad max you're gonna love it but like I don't know mainstream,0.29356045
audiences can get on board for like the amount of like weird crazy um you,0.3131951
got Nicholas Hoult who plays knucks who's kind of one of them Morton Joe's disciples,0.6364068
and he is just crazy he's just a crazy character he somehow kind of gets,0.7448024
brought in with Max and furiosa on this um this just crazy ride and you,0.40317646

piece have her action set piece after action set piece it is just one long,0.063676186
action scene the cinematography and this is beautiful beautifully beautifully shot and what like compliments,0.15667439
like the just beautifully shot film is the fact that almost I'm gonna say like,0.1663463
ninety percent of this movie is practical effects a lot of the color yes color,0.09505246
has been corrected so when you look at that you like yes that's not natural,0.11321664
but like that's pretty much it all the exploding cars the flipping cards the crashing,0.13190123
cars the stunts it's all real um it is and it is just wild it,0.11755425
is absolutely wild the stuff that they do in this movie it is unlike anything,0.15418692

if this is profitable which oh it is great it is so fantastic what's weird,0.16791026
about this movie though is how furiosa is pretty much the main character um max,0.1212617
is in it but Tom Hardy as Mad Max he's great he maybe has 20,0.19172081
lines of dialogue the entire movie he does not say anything at all he's just,0.105929345
kind of there and he's good and he's grunting and you get a good performance,0.11188325
but this movie belongs to Charlize Theron as furiosa this is badass she is badass,0.6364068
she is God she would make such an amazing action star and in this movie,0.076354675
is fantastic for just like it's just great and it gives this this woman just,0.29101577
