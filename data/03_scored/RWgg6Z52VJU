to go out on her journey and experience great things Lady Bird does meet boys,0.21304756
along the way here one of them played by Lucas hedges but this movie is,0.082923315

gives probably the best performance I've seen from her she is so so drastically real,0.31270963
in this movie and one of the best parts of what Greta Gerwig has done,0.12610477
with her script is that scenes kind of begin they don't feel like they have,0.12081182
a natural beginning like most movie scenes do when you sit down to write a,0.13047667

characters mid-conversation and you're like what were they just talking about well it doesn't matter,0.13923837
because we're now observing this moment and the moments are so well realized because the,0.036818035
scenes just come about that technique keeps this film feeling so raw the film also,0.076126486
has a really great balance of portraying our lead character at this religious school that,0.07219407
she's going to and it's making it hard on her she wants to blossom she,0.24125025
wants to do a lot with her life but there's a lot of restrictions there,0.09904836
normally when films have a character at a Catholic school or something very strict like,0.08371573
that they portray it as this big negative like a really horrible time in their,0.24237303
life where they weren't able to follow their dreams this movie sidesteps that and presents,0.18079735
it as simply not necessarily a roadblock but just something that Lady Bird has to,0.09053488
deal with it doesn't say you shouldn't go to Catholic school it doesn't say like,0.18860693
don't believe in these things because it's hard on you it just shows moments it,0.107353054

of them really strong work there is not a weak link in regards to the,0.06617396
actors here the film also balances the right amount of embarrassment with realism there's so,0.24326688
many scenes here where you just cringe for the lead character but it's not awkward,0.14921293
in the way that some films do when it comes off kind of pretentious like,0.18664552
hey look at this really awkward character we wrote aren't they so unique and different,0.14859127
and weird aren't I a great writer Greta Gerwig really does a great job to,0.10175507
avoid all of those cliches I'd be curious to know how much of the film,0.14945765
is improvised because the dialogue flows so naturally between actors I found myself really caring,0.039098762
about these characters I was wrapped up in their lives and I was honestly concerned,0.10278153
about them I felt like I wanted to befriend them and be like it's okay,0.19643594
