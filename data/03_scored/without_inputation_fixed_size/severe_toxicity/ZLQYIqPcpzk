children the men had innovative long takes and the governor was a fantastic use of,0.06998198
visual effects I think Burma is probably quads most technically impressive work the when he,0.021843966
manages to execute sermon in logistical challenging and technically difficult long tape filled with hundreds,0.19211501

expecting to feel more but then after the first hour and a bit I really,0.027097587
began to feel more and by the end I was moved and afterwards I can't,0.017024046
think of the film without being moved by why we ultimately took me on the,0.03727157
journey and so even emotionally it's a film which is complex in the film which,0.02075373
seems distancing but it's actually not and so well not just works in every conceivable,0.031153876
