hello everybody today I'm going to be reviewing a moon light this is written and,0.08494631
directed by Barry Jenkins Jenkins actually based the film on a play that he had,0.07976422
seen that was called in moonlight black boys turned blue chickens was so struck by,0.04700087
the play and also the playwright himself both of them had very similar backgrounds they,0.020926626
both grew up in Miami and a lot of the situations really resonated with him,0.079033636
and the result is this magnificent very sensory poetic work that I think depicts the,0.08343427
minority experience it's so beautifully and so authentically I really do think that this film,0.1369124
has the kind of artistic presence that can resonate with anyone and everyone and I,0.10150562
think it really does have a certain kind of raw power I walked into this,0.08551272
movie knowing almost nothing about it really I all have seen it was a poster,0.060760316
and just a brief premise and I think the less you know about the film,0.070980236
the better in terms of when you're just going in to watch it but I,0.07427346
mean when I talk about the premise I'm sure you're probably going to roll your,0.1221946
eyes because it does have a lot of what may seem like cliches and things,0.1437164
that we've seen over and over and over again it is a coming-of-age story it,0.07446731
has that typical set up character set up and plot set up that does seem,0.0726311
very much like Oscar bait or something of that nature but it's presented in a,0.051211625
way that is so unique to the filmmaker and in a way that I don't,0.05391246
think we've ever seen before it's actually kind of similar to boyhood and Tree of,0.07728429
Life in a lot of ways maybe more similar to boyhood but it is in,0.074212395
the sense that it is about a young boy going from childhood to adulthood and,0.0796555
this particular film it's told in three parts and honestly each part could stand on,0.07126808
its own as some great kind of short film but when you add them all,0.07192771
together that's when it really has a lot of gravitas in this case the film,0.07031032
is about an african-american male named Sharon and he it's basically just about him trying,0.40309688
to find himself him struggling with his identity his sexuality the persona that maybe he,0.30285504
wants to wear for the rest of his life and all of this is happening,0.10317739
of course while life throws all kinds of different obstacles at him Sharon is a,0.19894055
very awkward very taciturn kind of boy always feeling like he does fitting like he,0.30032998
can't express himself and where you might think the film is starting to veer into,0.0743894
cliche territory it actually doesn't but it may seem like it because he does have,0.10310657
a drug-addicted mother he is taken under the wing of a drug dealer who becomes,0.6656817
kind of his father figure there is the school bully so when you see all,0.35881335
of that you may kind of have an eye roll or two but this film,0.2106871
even though it does employ those ideas and those concepts that were used to it,0.057042666
does it in a way that feels like it's very complex and like it all,0.085800685
is serving the layers of the story the main ensemble of characters is very well,0.050467506
defined I think and all of this is done with very minimal dialogue but we're,0.05631138
in cliches you might see the drug-addicted mother or the bully being kind of negative,0.68154484
stereotypes and film in this case I feel that they offer that complexity because each,0.060587097
time something happens to the character of shyrone it always models the waters it's never,0.076493934
good or bad it's kind of a mix of the two because everything in life,0.18262304
is messy and I feel like in certain scenes of the film for sure the,0.047990803
film is kind of saying that whatever beats you down whether it's figuratively or literally,0.11347912
in this case it can good can come out of it it can help you,0.104452886
evolve and make you stronger and help you navigate life maybe a little bit better,0.15541372
but at the same time when good things happen and good people come into your,0.15447186
life sometimes that can lead to negativity that can lead to betrayal or it can,0.10386304
hurt you in some sort of way so there are pros and cons to everything,0.45248467
where I make a connection with the Tree of Life is more in the visual,0.054525718
style of it because I think they're similarly abstract especially at the beginning of the,0.06113218
film in this movie you feel like through the the camerawork it's like you along,0.14705099
with shyuum are discovering the world the cinematography in the beginning feels very physical it,0.08190148
feels very disorienting and you know there are parts of it that are kind of,0.10002466
out of focus and that to me kind of reflects what it's like being a,0.086661495
child you know that that vigor that confusion and that need for self-discovery but as,0.081808716
the film goes along it starts to kind of settle into itself a little bit,0.09649289
more and become more kind of soft and subtle and it's as if Sharon has,0.06973942
finally learned how to deal with the world and how to make his way in,0.121174514
a way that keeps him semi in control he may not necessarily completely understand the,0.054203242
world but you know who does but he's learned how to kind of defend himself,0.120422915
and build these hard calluses and nothing in terms of the aesthetic of the film,0.10651665
feels gimmicky I mean when you look at the cinematography or the lighting all of,0.05821322
it feels completely authentic and essential to the moment because it's not trying to reflect,0.054292828
reality necessarily but rather it's trying to capture emotion and the score is also amazing,0.042559817
and I can't even remember the last time that I actually took note of a,0.06494444
score and mentioned it on a YouTube video because it's so rare in this day,0.08530329
and age but it's very simple and very pure because it's you know for the,0.058434207
most part it's it's kind of the main theme is a simple melody but I,0.09548132
love the kind of wispy airy feel to the strings because it seems almost like,0.10389987
in the beginning of the film at least it seems like a bird is kind,0.07785802
of just starting to learn how to fly it's it's fluttering its wings almost like,0.0727652
it's testing the waters and all of these different elements come together in what feels,0.055587668
like this symphony of artistry basically in depicting an unlikely protagonist because first of all,0.08509611
we rarely see an african-american at the forefront of the film so that in itself,0.19078879
is wonderful to see but it's also just the fact that he isn't used in,0.07400563
a stereo to go away but what really resonated with me and I think what's,0.17426033
going to resonate with most people is the way that you see this character evolution,0.096315704
that his need for human connection and love vulnerability is so achingly present yet society,0.24607274
slowly chips away at that that beauty that innocence that we have when were children,0.18707393
until it's almost lost but it but it's not it's always there like in Sharon's,0.09036831
case in the case of so many men I mean when he's a young boy,0.31677517
he's taught to be this kind of masculine idealized man taught to walk it up,0.20492956
not to show emotion and that's just not who he is he's seen this week,0.10335469
because he wants to cry when everybody else says that that's not a good thing,0.2161977
and he also wants to express himself sexually in a lot of ways or at,0.46264607
least he has sexual confliction for sure but in the society in which he lives,0.5876557
he just doesn't know how to do that in part one of the film there's,0.07053494
a line by one of the characters where he tells shy room that you have,0.06385729
basically I don't remember exactly what the line is but you have to decide for,0.035530202
yourself who you want to be no one else can decide that for you and,0.18918554
that's a line that in movies and in life you do hear a lot but,0.07917125
I think that the film itself is trying to say that no you don't just,0.06289303
decide who you want to be we are so heavily influenced by our surroundings by,0.06095912
the people in our world we often become what we know whether we want to,0.1435541
or not and yet when we become adults we start to kind of find that,0.08476276
truth than you think steer and we start to want to strip away all of,0.6042668
that kind of hardened those hardened calluses that we've built up as children because that's,0.25176752
who we are inherently and I think that's what shyrone tries to do especially in,0.1816393
the third part of the film there's a quote by Roger Ebert that I know,0.03848102
I've mentioned several times I I definitely overuse it but I think that it fits,0.05894891
this film so perfectly and I kept thinking about it I was as I was,0.10093223
watching the movie and he said something along the lines of art is the only,0.08710234
way in which you can really truly understand what a stranger really feels and I,0.102597244
think that that just makes so much sense in the context of this film so,0.06894097
even if you work on Wall Street and make six figures a year or something,0.06624701
you can watch this movie and completely understand this young african-american man because you too,0.4843554
have become a product of your society and yet also like shyrone we you have,0.25569576
that need to be vulnerable and to be true to yourself despite all of those,0.22956508
layers that you've built over the years every once in a while a movie comes,0.08464151
around that really does move me in a way that I can't stop thinking about,0.11115374
it and I feel like in a way it just it really dug deep and,0.08322004
I it's much more than I feel most things boyhood was one of those and,0.06848284
Tree of Life was one of those and this film did just that I think,0.06276171
everybody has to see it it is just a masterful creation and that is my,0.089304775
