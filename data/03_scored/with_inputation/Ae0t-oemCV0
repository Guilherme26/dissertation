sad the more female x-wing pilots there's more Asian characters it has dark parts it,0.30828443
has light parts and there's a wings and I get it as a content creator,0.114729226
myself I can relate to what Disney is doing but there has to be a,0.041674275
line drawn at some point where it is impossible to keep everyone happy and I,0.05774999
know them how I do with my channel you know someone is going to dislike,0.34552804
something I do or it just won't agree with them but Disney don't have an,0.093769155
objective that this film just feels like a statistical analysis where it just feels synthetic,0.08758754
there's no heart in it it just literally just feels like a tick list and,0.081126735
everything that was missing from the force awakens has cut being slightly crammed into this,0.080187336
film and to me it's kind of it's quite obvious while my main prompts of,0.10427524
the song is it feels very bloated for one it has far too many characters,0.0708503
you pretty much have the original cast from the force awakens sweet girl I Bray,0.2824144
Luke kylo hots Leia Snoke Poe Finn Chewie mouths phasma c-3po r2d2 a bb-8 and,
that's excluding all of the new characters on top of that and if you compare,0.13073997
that to saya a movie like a like the imposter a smack that has pretty,0.3532743
much a cast of ten maybe plus a few extras like Boba Fett so when,0.24217874
you compare that with double the mass action double Man the jokes that doesn't leave,0.115484655
much room for kind of character development for example Finn story arc is almost completely,0.06555924
unnecessary I mean you could probably remove it from the film and it wouldn't overall,0.074646324
make any impact anything you could just have his character in state to sleep for,0.101915576
the whole movie and it really wouldn't have made much of a difference almost the,0.047493614
same goes for Luke's Marquez character I just found he was just heavily underutilized they,0.07871589
have had Morphin or just done more with him and I just found it was,0.109819084
a wasted opportunity they could just cram so much more Luke Skywalker in that film,0.18232056
but they chose not to probably cuz they're afraid of bringing back too much of,0.116680615
the old cast but I honestly I don't from there I've been a massive problem,0.11194005
how many Star Wars fans would you say would ever complain about having too much,0.05753318
Luke Skywalker in a movie the last Jedi also tries to be funny it's not,0.09133332
quite as effective as a film to say like thor ragnarok cool and you ever,0.16449934
got disney like properties where you know has lots of cute animals and it has,0.106071435
cuff the force awakens when has they've heard these little quirky funny parts but I,0.17352717
just felt just don't feel it was quite strong as the force awakens in that,0.068093814
department that means comedies subjective so some people probably disagree with me on that but,0.075998455
I honestly don't think it was quite as funny it was a quite fuse the,0.11414965
jokes were a little bit hit-and-miss well it feels like it's dialogue it's clean a,0.15287016
little bit made more for children like sums the lines to try remember snuff them,0.15017246
out one character says snuff them out or let's go chrome-dome or of course they,0.12882657
use like more familiar ones like you've read like rebel scum but I will never,0.7696345
that scene it will never be as good as the scene in like Return of,0.12177757
the Jedi you rebels this movie almost feels like clickbait where it builds up quite,0.22694936
a few great moments and this is really really big build up from quite a,0.05587312
few scenes but then they go and waste it we've all the characters development and,0.11742999
everything this film is so much potential to being great like the second act there's,0.085686415
some interesting character development between rain burn and also kylo Ren I won't go more,0.065866716
detail than that but it is it was going somewhere is really cool and they,0.048846096
don't really use it very effectively and there's quite a few lackluster moments where you,0.318119
think there's a what were you thinking it would have just been so cool if,0.06038304
they had gone a different direction but they didn't officer that's a personal preference and,0.03383089
obviously being a fan of the franchise everyone cut wants things can't go a particular,0.10264647
way and how they imagined it so when it doesn't then obviously it feels more,0.052889075
disappointing I understand that but for this I honestly think they could have done a,0.15295313
lot better I'd assume the resources Disney have they could have done better I obviously,0.067736864
think it's a little underwhelming I find the film's biggest weakness is probably its plot,0.27028707
I don't go into spoiler territory but it pretty much revolves around a starship fuel,0.0919215
and stalling for time it's filled with deus ex machina ray is still a complete,0.17369649
MarySue if you're not familiar with that term it pretty much means a character who,0.07327303
does nothing wrong there's everything pretty much correct every time everyone likes them the pretty,0.20315485
much near perfection so much to a stage where you can't actually relate to her,0.05778972
and she's very similar to that as she wasn't the force awakens and they haven't,0.15906844
kind of correct to that problem whether I recommend the last Jedi if you really,0.108714715
like the force awakens then yes it looks great it's fun it's funny I'm sure,0.101143
you're pretty much enjoy all of it but if you're like me and you found,0.15521047
that the force awakens was her like lust a remake off a new hope then,0.18403538
you'll probably think it's okay maybe you'll hate it but I can say that at,0.26133114
least it's not a carbon copy you know it has its own original content and,0.06302482
it does take a few chances here and there but as I said before it,0.041177236
just feels a little bit bloated I think too many characters there is some hope,0.0893959
there is progress hope maybe the third film it will be completely its own thing,0.07694649
100% and they won't need to steal scenes from other films they don't need to,0.15590817
you know they've got so much content there's so much resources they can do anything,0.11728443
they want hopefully an old for a public movie or something like that that'd be,0.19155699
brilliant see ya so they are getting something but yeah for me I just think,0.14492024
it's a good movie well I want to see it again a time soon probably,0.087642044
not maybe a year from now maybe I'll watch it but I had that same,0.045850202
effect with the force awakens so that's your benchmark really thanks for watching guys and,0.060750343
as always I appreciate the supports and if you like the video then by all,0.0649507
means like it and subscribe if your face suggestions please let me know hopefully I,0.17929144
