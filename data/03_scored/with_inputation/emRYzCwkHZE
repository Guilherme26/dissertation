released in 1940 directed by sir alfred hitchcock starring lawrence olivier and joan fontaine with,0.25222296
other notable performances by george sanders and judith anderson okay on to a quick synopsis,0.12431998
of the film it says a woman struggles with adjusting to her new role as,0.080190346
an aristocrat's wife and living up to the expectations of his first wife oh this,0.069893084
sounds like this is going to be fun i'm very excited to watch this so,0.10620084
at this point we are going to get into some historical background for those of,0.07318592
you who want to jump right onto the film reaction go for it but for,0.111902185
those of you who want to stay we're going to get right into it rebecca,0.18546608
was originally a novel written by daphne du maurier in 1938. de mourier was inspired,0.011520491
by some of the events in charlotte bronte's jane eyre when writing her novel rebecca,0.0900798
after rebecca was published it was an instant hit in both england and in the,0.11465674
u.s there was a lot of excitement about making this novel into a picture k,0.09623943
brown and east coast story editor had recommended this novel to big time movie producer,0.06365532
david o selznick and it was also k brown who had recommended gone with the,0.29669857
win to him as well so her recommendations were pretty spot-on so selznick was impressed,0.16239944
with the novel and decided to buy the film rights for fifty thousand dollars which,0.017654927
in today's money would be worth just shy of one million dollars selznick also hired,0.15052025
on alfred hitchcock to direct the film after noticing his success streak in england during,0.17863224
the production of this film there were some creative differences between selznick and hitchcock selznick,0.24213143
really wanted to stick as closely to the book as possible and hitchcock wanted to,0.3548586
lighten some of the dark gothic themes of the story now selznick would eventually go,0.14748622
on to write hitchcock about his disdain of some of the substitutions that hitchcock added,0.48571888
saying quote we bought rebecca and we intend to make rebecca end quote now despite,0.059727192
these differences rebecca was received very well with the audiences and it actually went on,0.05181066
to be nominated for 11 oscars at the 13th annual academy awards and it won,0.04247678
two including best picture okay on to some interesting facts now before this movie's release,0.070990205
selznick allowed orson welles to release a radio version of rebecca and unsurprisingly it was,0.15059325
a huge hit because as we know everything that orson welles touches turns to gold,0.1242165
so this was meant to draw up a lot of publicity for the film version,0.05492278
and once the radio version was released to the public everyone was super excited to,0.08428083
watch the film version of rebecca filming for rebecca started on september 8th 1939 which,0.050025612
was just less than a week after the uk entered world war ii now this,0.23252599
became slightly problematic because a lot of the members of the cast were british so,0.19538254
80 years later in october of 2020 netflix released a remake of rebecca starring lily,0.052191723
james and armie hammer and then finally this is the first criterion collection film that,0.060247
we are watching where i actually bought the physical copy of the film i was,0.042643894
so impressed with just the amount of care that they put into making just the,0.107171595
packaging of this and if you compare it to like say you know the good,0.15246168
the bad and the ugly this feels really plastic like it's just a case to,0.4010825
hold a dvd but this one is like really well packaged by the way this,0.125283
video was not sponsored i literally just wanted to share that with you because i,0.18590055
was just blown away by the packaging um now with all that being said i,0.11428459

a teeny weeny bit forward with mr winter your effort to enter the conversation quite,0.15354677
embarrassed me and i'm sure it did him her forwardness she didn't even say anything,0.38522893

guy i was able to have lunch with me okay i'm here for her i,0.16485767

a beautiful house on it right by the sea and the old lady said next,0.23958947
man didn't i like the dialogue of this film so far because it doesn't feel,0.12545666
like like doctored in any way i don't know if that makes sense but it,0.19136745
feels like a very natural very natural conversation between two people i'm really liking the,0.11158377
dialogue so far it's just a place where i was born i've lived in all,0.1136327
my life now i don't suppose i could ever see it again as soon as,0.09313086
he started talking about his home manderly his whole entire demeanor changed he went from,0.18749914

those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping altitude she's all like,0.31089434
i want to remember this moment forever and he's like well you don't want to,0.1516424

have to hand it to you for a fast workout how did you manage it,0.15143837
i love the use of the pannins in this film i wonder if that is,0.07584256
like a trademark of hitchcock that was then used later on to show suspense i,0.36022714
don't know you better leave mrs van harper you'll miss your train mrs dewinter goodbye,0.2396014
maddie and i'm telling you as much as we all want to fall in love,0.38230553

makes your heart melt but there's something else to him and i just i don't,0.08636367
completely trust him and why did he want to get married to her so quickly,0.11565053
you know just questions you gotta start asking yourself the the questions of like you've,0.15832147
only known each other for a couple of days why do you want to get,0.061873514
married to her so quickly um something's not completely right there's nobody that's mandating oh,0.13354604
wow it actually is really beautiful gorgeous it looks kind of like a cottage ish,0.1583639
cottage manor manor i don't know my house jargon okay i have everything in readiness,0.09628866
for you that's very good of you oh i didn't express this danvers she gave,0.33035237
her the up and down look she was like oh no this is like making,0.15989566
my nerves bad mrs danvers i i do hope we beat friends i hope i,0.6438652
should do everything to your satisfaction madam i've managed the house since mrs dewinter's death,0.53490317
and mr winter has never complained her eyes say so much like she says things,0.21260644
you can tell she is a woman who's very dedicated to her work but her,0.24144186
eyes tell a very different story she is like looking at this new bride all,0.083689846
up and down like you think you belong here but you don't belong here like,0.52989864
you just see it in her eyes that room in the west wing i was,0.15309788
telling you about is there through that door the only one that looks down across,0.074693866
the lawns to the sea it was mr winters i knew it i knew it,0.06352847
was mrs dewinter's room there'd be no other reason to board it up oh and,0.06817358
there's like a dog that just sits right in front of it oh i wonder,0.24093078
if they decided to use a black dog or like a darkly coated dog be,0.111555666
to kind of signify like an omen of some sort i don't know could be,0.2688575
me i love the the music in this i think the music really does set,0.058052216
the tone between scenes also because it's like the music starts to change a little,0.07384331
bit like it was like light-hearted and fun and now it's still light-hearted but there's,0.08578179
like little notes of of something a little bit darker in the music she's like,0.30943036
still totally in love with him have a look at the times there's a thrilling,0.11420137
article on what's the matter with english cricket oh my god laura it's olivier i,0.25198713
could not act with this man i would actually in real life fall in love,0.28976732
with him my sister beatrice and her husband giles lacey have invited themselves over for,0.48732734
lunch today already he's literally leaving her to deal with his sister and her hus,0.2576698
and her and her husband his sister and his sister's husband that's weird to say,0.26488453
there's that dog again yeah that i wonder if that dog is always like that,0.17473525
dog is always there whenever it's a room that the that rebecca would frequent so,0.08591776
yeah i wonder if this is like her study or something i don't know oh,0.15145174
i'm afraid you've made a mistake mrs dewind has been dead for over a year,0.45862988
oh i mean she's like i'm she's like when it's like mrs winter she's so,0.17493384
out of her depth it's almost like she's expected to live up to this sort,0.16564561
of idea this role that i don't think that she's ready for at all she,0.22204453
had some pretty high profile friends oh no i like that phone call that she,0.12378154
received and she's like oh i'm sorry mrs dewitt has been dead for over a,0.44967955
year and then she hangs it up and she's like wait but i'm mrs dewinter,0.24074894
shall we sit down you see she's bound to be insanely jealous at first and,0.50326484
she must resent you bitterly why why should she she simply adored rebecca so that's,0.26773167
why she's all dark inside cause she's like your tail like i said she's like,0.7210787
you're taking a place that is not yours like oh no that could spell trouble,0.23323666
my dear you fond of dancing well i love it but i'm not very good,0.295285
at it so but i'm trying to find out exactly what your wife does do,0.19568418
she sketches a little he doesn't even know what his wife does because they only,0.3264484
know each other for like two days he doesn't even know her what don't sail,0.14951071
do you no i don't thank goodness for that oh so he wasn't supposed to,0.079961605
mention sailing oh no what does that mean why don't you do something about your,0.234914
hair no it looks perfect i can see by the way you dress you don't,0.19012663
care who how you look wow he must have changed a lot then wow the,0.075533286
sister is really forward i'm here for it you know the whole story no she,0.08111969
doesn't i don't even think i know the whole story now we can have a,0.049587656
walk about the place runner get a coat from the flower room for mr winter,0.08606051
will you just hearing her being called mrs dewinter doesn't even sound like right because,0.25581947
i feel like this whole film we have been conditioned to think of rebecca as,0.05718466
mrs dewinter and like this woman as his new wife you know where does that,0.38208207
lead to oh it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a,0.065895006
boat oh let's go down there all right we'll walk down and take a look,0.18314151
if you really want to oh my god i love this i love the romance,0.09621745
of it but i just feel like it's too good to be true he's heard,0.08342291
himself no he's all right leave me alone don't you think i better go and,0.17150024
see don't bother about him i'll tell you he can't come to anyone he'll find,0.18993111
his own way back something happened there there's no way there's no way he's reacting,0.09351399
like that because there's something happened there oh and it opened by itself don't go,0.0936019
in there i know that dog he comes for the elf ew he's mr de,0.2659747
winter's dog you're mrs dewinter oh that's weird i didn't like the way he looked,0.2870268
at her rebecca dewinda oh my goodness she had some affiliation with that cottage know,0.13657811
i didn't want you to go there but you deliberately went oh because i hate,0.46109337
the place and if you had my memories you wouldn't go there or talk about,0.17204884
it read and think about it you should never have come back to mandarin he,0.19018148
knows there's something that happened that something that he is not telling her secrets skeletons,0.24129473
in the closet are those all rebecca's things down there yes she was washed overboard,0.17167929
wasn't she afraid to go out like that alone she wasn't afraid of anything everyone,0.18401599
knows something that this woman whose name has still not been mentioned okay this woman,0.31089434
and the audience don't know they know something because they're all super secretive and super,0.12501588
shady i don't know i don't know what's going on they're all comparing me with,0.22931905
him yep with rebecca you have qualities that are justified really big shoes so throughout,0.09543867
this film there you really do get the sense that she is being compared to,0.15236092
this glorious rebecca de winter but then also there are people who are like yeah,0.15040706
you're really sweet like they're like comparing her but then also reassuring her that she's,0.19578066
like good or in a good position and it just feels really strange i don't,0.07809567
know why tell me what was rebecca really like i suppose she was the most,0.07189927
beautiful creature i ever saw oh well that makes you feel good huh literally just,0.2710732
negated everything he said to her to reassure her oh she's trying you think there's,0.1589642
something's right for you doesn't seem your type at all she loves him so desperate,0.27658305
like i don't think that he loves her the way that she loves him and,0.14749195
the tragedy is that like he's trying to fill these shoes of this woman who,0.32885903
i'm not even really sure existed at this point okay because we still have not,0.09558299
seen her and it's just sad it's like don't compare yourself to someone who you'll,0.23017463
never be you know it appears that mrs danvers has accused robert of stealing a,0.20538743
valuable ornament from the morning room what was the thing anyway china cupid sir oh,0.25184453
yeah that's one of our treasures isn't it it was it was the thing that,0.06508458
she broke that is all i broke the china cupid you broke it is it,0.42979267
possible to repair the ornament madam smashed into pieces she looks man look at fruit,0.40312746
fritz was even scared for a second he was looking like oh no what's going,0.10658296
to go down she kept her composure but her eyes were like this he says,0.40323365
dan must must be furious with me oh hang this down oh she should you,0.5958016
be frightened of it cause she's scary abstract is made or something i do love,0.24178314
how she how danvers really keeps her composure the whole time because you don't know,0.26794755
what she's thinking i mean you can see it in her eyes right but like,0.15776092
she's so calm about it and it just it intensifies things i suppose that's why,0.15420397
you married me never be any gossip about me got it whoa whoa the lighting's,0.31089434
on his face i also like how he really kept the audience in the dark,0.09386514
here like in this film we're really as much in the dark as you know,0.14258471
this woman who is this new mrs dewinters i've gone up to london on some,0.5078158
business of the estate i shall return before evening and certainly this brief holiday from,0.048594162
me should be welcome maxim she's like in despair she's like where's my maxim i'm,0.26089174
sure she does not like that house or the people living in it looking for,0.24186581
me left his little bride all alone this is mr favel madam i am rebecca's,0.18561688
favorite cousin who one of rebecca's family members oh my god i don't know what,0.08660946
i love this this suspense i don't know what to think right now i'm so,0.1500874
lost don't go in there girl don't do it i know you want to it's,0.25293645
on your face oh she's about to go in and of course the room is,0.27751195
big she looks so small in this big space and it's like symbolic of her,0.40331587
like not being able to fill these shoes of mrs dewinter that's really i see,0.15006742
what you did there hitchcock i see what you did there it's a picture of,0.31089434
maxim kind of tells us that she really loved him i love how we get,0.14824428
the characterization of rebecca she really is a main character in this film yet she's,0.11880067
never physically seen so that's really cool that we kind of get that in this,0.071731
this is where i keep all her clothes feels like this is weird they were,0.32409328
made especially for her by the nuns and the convent of sinclair oh wow how,0.3366604
glorious that her her uh like her drawers like open like kind of like a,0.36580524
lazy susan almost where it like opens up and it's just like it's just so,0.29594454
glorious wow i always used to wait up for her no matter how late sometimes,0.14909671
she and mr winter didn't come home until dawn very much admired her just hearing,0.08852161
of the greatness of rebecca how everyone loved her all these things it's furthering this,0.07771719
poor woman's idea of herself like i'm never going to be this i could never,0.3293383
be this for max for manderley like i'm not this woman like it's this is,0.37387982
a lot poor girl did you ever see anything so delicate it is delicate wow,0.35886192
like she looks visibly uncomfortable about this entire situation like it's kind of making me,0.17404565
uncomfortable a little bit i'm like i feel that secondhand like discomfort do you think,0.26878223
the dead come back and watch the living i don't believe it i wonder if,0.16185378
she doesn't come back here demandedly watch you and mr winter together you know that's,0.14153695
probably not something that she wants to hear it's probably not something she wants to,0.10551766
hear she's constantly surrounded by ideas and thoughts of rebecca it's like haunting her i,0.18515664
am sister winter now mrs danvers gotta watch out for her thanks maximum could we,0.17760351
have a costume ball i feel that we ought to do something to to make,0.13186483
people feel that mendel is just the same as it always was instead of cowering,0.09267475
and like running away and being afraid she stood her ground and she's like no,0.17440756
i am the new mrs de winter and she like stood her ground okay honey,0.15425168
i see you boo you might find a costume among the family portraits that would,0.24195969
suit you oh you mean those at the top of the stairs i'll go and,0.105157524
look at them she is staging a war oh my goodness i've heard mr winter,0.16254789
say that this is his favorite of all the paintings oh well well well that's,0.054041002
a splendid idea mrs danvers i'm i'm very grateful um i don't trust her i,0.35469538
don't trust her at all um i wonder if that's rebecca and that costume is,0.15476978
going to get a rise out of the winter oh my god i think that's,0.10756365
what's going to happen you were the first one down yes where's the child well,0.24099502
she's keeping a costume for every single show oh lovely oh please don't come in,0.34353298
beatrice i don't want anyone to see my costume every single aspect of this film,0.31089434
has some sort of like suspenseful leading on the audience what's gonna happen next how's,0.1187264
everyone gonna react like he truly is the master of suspense i just i'm scared,0.28077078
i know something is off good evening mr de winter oh my god what did,0.10031359
i say what did i say dan vs staging a war oh i watched you,0.18268715
go down just as i watched her a year ago even in the same dress,0.3494926
you couldn't compare you knew it you never trust your enemy dude mmm that naivety,0.53490317
got her this time am i done do you think you should never hate me,0.2817201
so you're trying to take her i knew it i've seen his face he doesn't,0.23655081
love you he wants to be alone again with her you have nothing to live,0.24766457
for really have you she is just tearing her down emotionally and mentally oh this,0.490035
scene is so powerful and we feel with this woman everything you are strong you,0.19364333
can do this fight here i'm talking as if she could listen she can't hear,0.16323848
me she's like you could never compare to her like what are you even doing,0.44422662
like just tearing her down that was that was and but here's the thing she,0.19502506
did it keeping her composure very sinister stuff i knew where rebecca's body was because,0.30900857
i put it there what wait a second did he just confess to murder did,0.5154597
he did he murder rebecca wait a second wait a second wait a second what,0.404977
is going on oh my god how could we be close when i knew you,0.1082848
were always thinking of rebecca you thought i loved rebecca i hated it oh my,0.30913335
god that changes everything this whole time i'm thinking to myself he just loved her,0.10435939
so much and he's grieving her death but no he just literally said he hated,0.5266153
her i want to hear his story okay i was told i was the luckiest,0.06360917
man in the world but i never had a moment's happiness with her she was,0.28180158
incapable of love she stood there laughing and told me all about herself oh my,0.28375262
god so what did rebecca do i want like an origin story of rebecca now,0.073586464
i i need to know more about her so i'll play the part of a,0.0668295
devoted wife mistress of your precious mandalay i'll make it the most famous show place,0.24066657
in england if you like i kept the bargain and so did she apparently oh,0.0944169
she played the game brilliantly so it's like we're really getting a full character analysis,0.07587029
or a full character development of someone who we don't actually ever see i think,0.08037513
that is fantastic then there was a cousin of hers a man named favel yes,0.14534901
i know him why didn't you tell me i thought it would remind you of,0.09711188
rebecca so i wonder if he really did marry this woman because he really actually,0.2630718
found love with her literally this plot twist just changed the entire perspective of the,0.100300714
film oh my god when i found that she'd come back quietly from london i,0.10331931
thought that favela was with her and i knew then that i couldn't stand this,0.18192175
life of filth and deceit any longer okay so favel is not rebecca's cousin i,0.6606555
think favelas might be her lover at least that's what it sounds like that is,0.14670604
so twisted a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her suddenly she got up started,0.31387195
to walk toward me oh my god and they're using the camera angles to literally,0.09849699
show us her movements they're lit they're literally characterizing a person who doesn't actually exist,0.30942914
in terms of like like physically like she isn't physically there and yet they're making,0.11093696
her be there that is so strange i must have stuck almost triumphant she stumbled,0.31377092
and fell it's almost like she wanted him to kill her like to say i,0.87866724
got you even in death oh my gosh i remember wondering why she was still,0.60455304
smiling and i realized she was dead but you didn't kill me she fell it,0.5395885
was an accident who would believe me yeah yeah and and who would believe him,0.3660663
because she's she's literally shown herself as like the devoted perfect wife nobody knows about,0.4256726
her like secret life except for him so no one would believe him they're writing,0.17548464
if they find out it was rebecca you must simply say that you made a,0.06700643
mistake about the other body she can't harm you anymore we're the only two that's,0.24018463
not true no maxim you and i she literally has not been shown this entire,0.25530523
film and still somehow she is still the strongest character in this film there's nothing,0.09866014
you can do she won i loved you my darling he really did love her,0.17538837
no no she hasn't won no matter what happens now she hasn't won bro she,0.15128525
totally won like i'm just so blown away at the fact that she literally has,0.15399908
not even been physically shown yet she holds more pow the freaking movie is named,0.63597673
after her okay this is this is rebecca's movie she is the shining star of,0.07748722
the film and we don't even see her i am floored i don't mind this,0.12266424
whole thing except for you he loves her oh we still have this strong romance,0.1524449
that we can still root for you know that we're like okay he truly loves,0.10387291
her he truly wants to be with her which i like i don't know nothing,0.40309873
i don't want to go to the asylum clearly he didn't see anything okay move,0.15191776
on anyway i feel bad that i misjudged him in the beginning he was a,0.24195042
little creepy i'm not gonna lie but you know what he truly was just kind,0.28805208
of like a a bystander mr winter please i have to ask you a very,0.19937125
personal question where relations between you and the late mr winter perfectly happy she looks,0.14906415
like she's literally about to blow and say something and screw everything up she just,0.66996986
needs to chill out i won't stand this any longer and you might as well,0.23681256
know now will adjourn to oh lunch mr winter i presume you'll be available for,0.06648292
us then oh my god this is so intense darling wait here a few moments,0.07812538
i'll see if i can find old frank and how does the bride find herself,0.11382472
today you know you've grown up a bit since i lost this oil what do,0.13453183
you want for them you can also kind of see that in the the wardrobe,0.1160158
or the costuming choices that they've used throughout the film she looks like she really,0.06402687
has grown up like this really has taken the innocence right out of her i,0.23196739
find myself in a rather awkward position it's from rebecca and what's more she had,0.14951332
the foresight to put the date on it but i can assure you that it,0.058489315
is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night,0.44953334
i'm not gonna lie i kind of like favel's character like he's like he's sly,0.37084574
but he does it very like charismatically he's like i know what's going on you,0.13260587
know like i don't know i really like his character even though i feel like,0.09596797
he's a bad guy he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the,0.3693267
inquest if i made it worth his while just seen the doctor and i'm going,0.06964659
down to mandalay right away i have something terribly important to tell you rebecca i,0.2595988
thought the letter was going to be something like like more in-depth like you know,0.061758887
starting a new life hey maybe this kid might be yours i still don't know,0.24983299
if that's her cousin ah here she is the missing link apply the motives i,0.12848236
believe you'll know everyone else and we know that she is like in total admiration,0.08626186
of rebecca so she's oh something's gonna go down i feel it who was rebecca's,0.15305226
doctor i don't know anything about it oh don't give me that danny you knew,0.11532011
everything about rebecca you knew she was in love with me didn't you love was,0.14403367
a game to her only a game it made her laugh i tell you i,0.15974659
knew that i knew that she admired that dark side of rebecca i knew it,0.07728874
it has been suggested mrs dewinter was deliberately murdered the name of the murderer it's,0.46096516
a lovely name george fortescue maximilian de winter look at her face the first time,0.24209611
she's shown emotion on her face we don't want reminiscences danny what was his name,0.34096047
dr baker 165 goldhawk road shepherd's bush there you are colonel there's where you'll find,0.07654268
your motive he is just a little freaking rat that is the first time i'd,0.8211621
ever seen emotion on her face i've never attended a mrs winter in my life,0.2492594
the lady must have used an assumed name the woman was very seriously ill what,0.25558558
was wrong with her cancer that would have given her motive to want to take,0.40339226
her life literally this plan the favela had literally backfired on him that's what you,0.36917692
get for being a douchebag there was nothing that could be done for her except,0.8606264
wait she smiled in a queer sort of way when i told her it was,0.40328926
a matter of months she said oh no doctor not that long she knew she,0.1374241
was gonna die and she had pla like she planned this she planned this cunning,0.69542736
woman please just let them live in peace danvers please they've been through so much,0.34133312
oh my god she's gonna set up she's gonna set a fire she's gonna set,0.3349547
a fire i can i can see it she has the candle she has the,0.26069495
crazy eyes oh my god she's gonna commit arson just dry it it's that's not,0.46174604
the northern lights that's mandalay she's totally dead there's no way that she's like that,0.31774002
oh she made it out oh jesus thank you thank you thank you that she,0.23968826
made it out i was literally freaking out she she's in there she looks crazy,0.63904923
that final scene with vr oh what a film that was fantastic that had me,0.10392728
on the edge of my seat from beginning to end like all of the twists,0.12800689
and at the end it just kept coming just new information just pow pow pow,0.07805247
right at us i mean that was fantastic i think that was so good you,0.12542908
never saw rebecca and yet she was such a prevalent figure in this film so,0.0910611
the fact that they were able to make this character so real and so like,0.055296734
visceral without actually having her physically there is astounding it was fantastic and then the,0.24019456
plot twists where like we got to see a different side of rebecca not this,0.047115047
brilliant beautiful cunning woman but this like sadistic sinister monster even though mr dewinter maxim,0.76880604
didn't tell us what she had said to him after those four days of marriage,0.076415405
we still got the sense that it was something that was a lot darker than,0.057190068
you know what she was letting on on the surface i definitely have to give,0.10210644
