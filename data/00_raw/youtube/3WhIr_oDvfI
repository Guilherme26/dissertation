hi I'm Andre time a black nerd with a review for you better reviews Mad Max fury road I'm gonna tell you the good imma take the bad I'm gonna take the nerdy plot of Mad Max fury road Mad Max and furiosa are mr. and mr. your girl's best knives ever this will be pretty much spoiler free I might hit a couple of plot points but I won't give any major things away promise first the good this movie is action pack it starts off with action you get like maybe two scenes where people just sit around and talk and the rest of the time you are on the fury road you are seeing fight - you're seeing cars you're seeing explosions good stunts to the practical effects yes you're gonna get that big CGI scene with the tornado I've got no problem with CGI fights I got no problems with characters fighting multiple robots and creatures or whatever else but sometimes you lose a little bit of the gravitas with it you start feeling you're watching the cartoon with this the whole time I'm watching the movies going did I really get hurt once you have a giant truck with speakers on it and a dude playing guitar with a mask on his face and the guitar is spitting fire and you accept that you know you in the right place this imagine if like fast and furious had a nuclear explosion fallout in Borderlands for that to pot dr. Dre California video which of course was inspired by Mad Max that is what this world is and I love it and even what the action scenes they're not all crazy in your face some are just very simplified action but still just good it's just such a good movie there's not a lot of dialogue in this and yet you can still follow the story the actions and the emotions of people really speak for themselves get a little prologue a little voiceover I'd m√°ximos a compliment or breath other than that you just figure stuff out just from the way people are and that's cool even with it being based on a franchise especially one from 30 years ago it's a self-contained story yeah you can make a sequel out of it and trust me I'm sure they're gonna try whether we get or not get another Mad Max this is a beginning middle in here there's no random scene thrown in to set up some other movie there's no random character that we see for five minutes because they're gonna show up as a major character later or maybe who knows some money out of this might get their own movie I'm just saying Charlie's throne as furiosa is freaking a in this film she fights she's badass she's so great now I know there's been some criticism that people are like is this a Mad Max film cuz I'm pretty much seen like there's one part of the movie where he's not heavily involved for a reason but once he is is there the entire time it's just that he has a really good person beside him but as far as the setup of the movie it's the same as the Mad Max movies particularly last two Mad Max movies he's on his own he's drifting he's lost everything he wants to just get out of Dodge but he meets some people who need his help he don't want to help they bargain with him to get him to help and then he reluctantly helps but then of course gets close to the people helps him out and then once everything is said and done he's out of there that's what happened in road warrior that's what happened Beyond Thunderdome but that's what happens in this it's just this time there's a person along the way charli's their own furiosa who's just is awesome it's not the same as you know going to see a movie about transformers but most of the movie is starting shot LaBeouf we're going to see move about Ninja Turtles with Mosul movie in April milk the Smurfs the most time is Neil Patrick Harris but that being said Charlie's the road is amazing Charlie's the road Daniel you rock this movie oh my gosh you are amazing shave your head we're off - geez - she's amazing in this movie but max is good to Mexican so if you want a badass dude you got it if you want a badass chick you got if you want action you got it if you want explosions you got it bad guys you got it racing you got this movie has everything if you all hot chicks you're good - they're saving these women the breeders that this evil man amoral Joe has he's basically like the leader of a religious cult he has access to water he's got access to gas get access to food so everybody follows him they paint their selves white when they want to do something for more Tony like spray paints Chrome on their face on the mouse like spray-on grills because he's movie I promise I'm sorry maybe it's just because I just watched this on Netflix but the whole hey immoral Joe being the leader of this cold and he has these women trapped did anyone else get it unbreakable kimmy schmitt vibe from this break it's zoe kravitz it's a miracle and I never thought I'd say this but Rosie huntington-whiteley remember the girl that replaced Megan Fox in third Transformers film she was like some Island Michael Bay said I must have her he was pretty much immortal joke you will be min my movie you will be mine I'm immortal BAE I was very impressed by her kudos to Rosie I take back everything I said about dark and moon no no no I'm sorry yeah you you redeemed yourself but I'm not taking anything back the character I kind of identify with the most is Nicholas Hoult he plays nuts it means nothing more to him than to have a mortal Joe recognize him and one day take him to the gates of Valhalla there's a particular scene that I felt bad for this dude even with him being on the bad side you just want to do this one thing right you finally get the opportunity to do it he does something wrong and you just are like oh man oh man that was so much fun non-stop can't say enough good things about this movie but it's a black bear review so you know if I got to give you the good and I got to give you the back ok 3d you gotta stop I'm sorry this was my limit I'm cool with IMAX I'm cool with big screen but the 3d gimmick has got to go this movie is going so good I've enjoying myself and then there's just one little mask or one little guy running across or one little guitar just something that just just shooting directly at the screen and I don't watch it in 3d but I knew oh this is for the 3d screen stop doing that it just takes you out of a movie when things do that make a 3d gimmicky complete film or just make a film in a 3d environment I'm so sick of seeing scenes in movies where I know they are deliberately there just so they can have that 3d effect so they can say hey let's make people pay $3 more for 3d if you don't need it don't do it it doesn't know if it's a sequel or a reboot and I think it would have helped to decide they explained generically who max is in the beginning you're gonna be able to follow it even if you know nothing about the Mad Max franchise it's a whole new story but yes there aren't time that's kind of referencing something that happened in earlier Mad Max films but you don't really get too much detail to it the biggest part of that are these flashbacks there's time when Max has these just weird flashbacks where something happened in the past you can leave it to interpretation if you've seen some of those earlier films you might have a better understanding of what that's trying to reference so I think if they would have just decided it was a sequel decided was a reboot and just gave some kind of context to some of those things that would just made it absolutely perfect for the nerdy immortal Joe the main bad guy in this film is played by the same actor who played toecutter the main bad guy in the very first Mad Max bill from over 30 years ago that is an amazing thing and obviously the director George Miller has been with Mad Max since the beginning but did you know that George Miller was also the director of babe pig in the city and the Happy Feet movies now the next time they do a Mad Max film I just want your pig on a motorcycle like a talking pig Mohawk and then in the back is just a penguin dancing okay I have to dress criticism on the internet of what is this movie trying to convey is it trying to teach us something to preach something to blow it's a movie enjoy the movie for what it is it's fun are there some themed attic elements you can platter alike sure what movie doesn't have that um soul plane it is just a movie to enjoy and I enjoyed it man I can't recommend this movie enough Mad Max cannot be beat well except by female acapella group gangs can't stop them cars can't stop them guns can't stop them acapella singing 90s hip-hop jams too much for max let me know what you thought of Mad Max fury road I love you like a blade doesn't about a 5000
