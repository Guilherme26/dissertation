so hi and welcome to the channel to the first part of what i'm mostly,0.028436601
calling my first season of my french cinema season plan is to take one film,0.030309757
roughly from each decade from the 1930s up and talk about it in terms of,0.020492978
theme in terms of plot in terms of ideas and imports relevance to the events,0.014984592
of the world that were going around long around that time and what was happening,0.024767447
around cinema and why this film is worth talking about or worth watching and a,0.05132291
mixture of these films will be either films that have seen either once or more,0.03970082
times beforehand or a film that i watched that seemed to fit or be different,0.032771602
enough around that time to talk about and if i'm gonna start in the 1930s,0.084054604
there's really no other place to start off than well one of the most important,0.043574184
i would say films of all time or one that many people will revere for,0.026005354
numerous reasons and we'll discuss reasons why that may be you may be familiar with,0.014276837
it you may not you may have heard about it you might not have but,0.0436121
it is the film that has got infamy certainly in boutique blu-ray collecting circles as,0.061949883
being spine number one in the criterion collection that is jean-ren mars or grand illusion,0.017961955
the grown religion is a 1936 film which stars jean-gaban as a co-pilot or a,0.051010273
helper for a pilot who was shot down in an enemy territory and captured by,0.20247193
the germans now this is all set in world war one and while the film,0.27476123
is a war film it is a war film of taste or it is not,0.086290285
a bombastic war film that many were filmed you've seen before because there's hardly a,0.03185764
bullet fired there's hardly a shout of anger this is a film about the nicer,0.18110555
side of war or what happens behind the scenes in war it talks about the,0.06573944
relationships between the people that are both together and their captors and what john menmore,0.16792561
was thinking about that jungkook is a mechanic to the more celebrated captain blonde they,0.01333028
are thrust together into the same captivity and what you have is a film that,0.051235106
explores like i say relationships between different nationalities but also relationships around aristocracy and working,0.05245106
class and really this is what the film is about regardless of experiences of war,0.044243358
because on one level we have captain blunder the captured french officer who's from the,0.04932869
aristocracy and then you have erik vance throughheims character van rothenstein who is the german,0.14494884
aristocrat who's his captor and one of the ideas that renoir had and that he,0.049387224
has said about subsequently is that our circumstances are the things that bind us together,0.011271537
he often says rather than the frenchness of each other being the people our nationality,0.0717221
that binds us together that is our experiences so he uses the experience or the,0.01481497
example of a chinese farmer in a french farmer meeting as long as they could,0.22951044
get over the language buyer they would have lots to speak about whereas the aristocracy,0.021231331
and the working class have left to speak around well once they get the their,0.015335144
common bond of being french out of the way so these are these are the,0.038125664
themes that are explored within and sure enough when rothenstein and captain blunder bond over,0.060701333
their common upbringing there is a camaraderie around people of same class even in war,0.2564288
situations and they will dine together just like the working class can dine together but,0.018033128
one of the other nice things that comes into this is that the aristocracy in,0.023477657
the work class they see that these things are changing in the modern world so,0.011731844
things like wealth are going to break down these class buyers if you have enough,0.05626589
wealth it can subjugate or tear apart these boundaries an example being one of the,0.056263894
captors is a jewish banker he comes from a family of juice bankers and they,0.24852398
have wealth and while there he's in captivity together with the other people that are,0.023172338
supposedly of working class they can eat quite well because his family sent him food,0.0225311
packages into captivity and they eat lavishly just like the aristocracy and while blunder and,0.018645763
von rafenstein think about you know how this they're the last bastions of that generation,0.042682175
it is born out with what you have here and while there are other things,0.039469335
and there are other parts of this film brought to the fore it is these,0.024531309
that stick in the mind the idea that those in captivity are trying to escape,0.029934594
is one that runs throughout the film as they're thwarted by both circumstance or by,0.009016564
otherwise and you get this really wonderful taste of even at the end of high,0.054131314
barriers and neat people's needs circumvent that the underlying themes are the underlying beliefs that,0.02792973
are there i do intend to talk about some of the relationships between the director,0.023749052
and what they they made though because jean renoir was somebody that fought in the,0.039407473
first world war he had an injury that he sustained and he this is sort,0.18354945
of loosely autobiographical about many of the experiences that he thought he had or experienced,0.022831764
around that time and what was supposedly a gentleman's world world war one and on,0.14008568
the back of her in the face of world war two coming across which was,0.37391493
a very militant war which was much more about technology which was much more about,0.05468009
hatred this contrasts with what world war one was now on the side of this,0.21936959
you have what actually happened the film itself and this is i think one of,0.024635741
the lovely bits of story that actually where art mimics life because this film was,0.048033576
used insane as bit of a a bit of a populist piece around war and,0.25557685
what war should be and what it shouldn't be so much so that when the,0.05899846
nazis seen it they confiscated it they got rid of the film they did not,0.28251415
want it seen when roosevelt seen it in america for his i'm sure as a,0.04042454
part of the birthday party for his wife he fell in love with the film,0.033424813
he wanted it widely seen he thought this was the very embodiment of what a,0.062829256
modern society should be so while he was praising it the nazis were looking rid,0.33370402
of it this kind of idea of populist or using the film as a way,0.06215476
to tell a message or to spread the good word was at very much at,0.03721636
the far ends of the spectrum in fact lagrand illusion was confiscated so much that,0.019292321
people thought it was lost the time turns out that it was in the russian,0.05725635
health part of berlin and they decided to take it away with them for many,0.0490094
years and put it in the moscow film foundation and it was only returned to,0.02037657
france around 1960 toulouse uh for restoration and for looking at and as a a,0.07718791
piece of of grand cinema other prints that were used at the time there was,0.023049278
one put out in 1948 there were there were pieced together from other surviving elements,0.037237644
but the original fulfillment was only really brought back in that stage and then later,0.0194666
they were re-scanned and cleaned up and and the film that we see today bores,0.048414726
bears fruit from that it has a stunningly beautiful picture even by modern standards in,0.07247109
the form that we have it the release that i had which was the studio,0.017743109
canal version has lots of really considered extras both about the journey of the film,0.029517524
how it passed from nation to nation and how those nations had to work together,0.108913176
for a common goal of restoring this film and the fact that nobody actually did,0.027686939
even though it was heated by the nazis they didn't actually destroy it they held,0.32965338
on to it and stored it away so it wouldn't be seen and as many,0.03789485
parts of of nazi life they appreciated art and there was a appreciation of how,0.30533135
powerful art could be in so far as you know girls had lenny reefing style,0.07832338
make propaganda films so so this is this is the film that we see today,0.026725749
and one that i desperately think everybody should check out in some way should perform,0.08612399
thanks for watching and i'll catch you next time when we go to the 1940s,0.09858022
and as well as a surprise and for let you prepare i'll tell you what,0.022652164
film that i'm going to do i'm going to talk about panic by jules de,0.03965426
vivre a story about another jewish person in the face of war i'll catch you,0.6604896
