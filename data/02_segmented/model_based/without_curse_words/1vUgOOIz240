"Katelyn Deaver stars in Book-smart where she does her best to break out of her character as smart and responsible Eve Baxter, by playing somebody who is smart and responsible except with a terrible mouth"
Its Olivia Wilde's feature-length directorial debut
So how does she do with this high school drama tea? So it's the day before graduation and the two top students in the school who happen to be best friends realize that they have missed out on all kinds of parties and really just high school social life because they focused so much on their schoolwork in order to get into the top schools
"Then they realize though that their friends, well, their acquaintances, their classmates, who did party, who did have a lot of high school experiences, also got into those exact same top schools, so they set out on the night before graduation to find an epic party so that they can kind of cram all of these experiences into one night before they graduate"
"All of the characters seem to be kind of caricatures of real-life I mean, they are all just taken kind of to the extreme and really exaggerated"
"I mean, like the jock is all jock"
The skater is kind of just dumb and brainless and a little bit clueless
"The the stoner is Well, there's stoned out of their minds, and even the gay guys are just wildly an overly flamboyant"
and just it was a little off-putting to see all of these characters who are just such extremes of anything based in reality
"I mean, Yes, you do have all of these people on all of those as examples in real life, but typically you don't have all of them to such a degree in one small little microcosm, So to see them all put into that situation, it did feel just a little bit forced, like it didn't feel or ring true"
"So along with Kaitlyn Dever, we have beanie Feldstein and together they're kind of good"
"I mean they, they, for the most part bring out the best in each other"
"I mean, they really work hard as best friends to complement each other to lift each other up, and I appreciated that a lot, but on the other hand, they're also super crude together and that began to really great on me"
"Just it, it became wildly unnecessary and like that, they were just trying to be crude for Croods sake"
"Now I'm not a prude or even disillusioned that there aren't crude people out there, and that that's not how real life is"
"However, in this scenario it felt forced"
"It felt almost like that's how it should be that everybody should be crude or that they should be acting like this versus it, kind of being in the minority"
"I mean, I volunteer with middle schoolers and high schoolers and for the most part they don't act this way"
"I mean, sure, there are some that do, And and we all have our periods of you know, acting out or whatever"
But this In this instance in the film it just it felt like it was trying to tell us
No
"No, this is how you're supposed to be versus Hey, That's kind of an anomaly or a little blip on the screen"
The pace of the film is is pretty good
"I mean, it moves along and it keeps the story going for the most part right up until about the beginning of the third act, and then it just kind of steps on the brakes for a minute and it slows way down, and then after that it picks back up again, so you know I had a minor pacing issue there, just because you start to feel the time just a tiny bit, but for the most part throughout the film you don't notice the time moving along"
"I like some of the interactions between the characters, and I also really like that some of the assumptions that are placed on the characters at the beginning of the film, or that we are told to have assumptions as an audience, they turn out to be wrong, and then also that we see growth in some of the characters"
I really like that
"I really appreciate that fact, because have the characters all stayed flat throughout the entire thing? Then it's just kind of pointless"
"I mean, there's no reason to watch because it's just you're just watching a day in the life of somebody where they don't learn anything"
"And to me, that's just kind of a waste of time"
but they thankfully didn't do that with all of the characters
"I mean, you actually saw growth"
You saw change
"you saw repentance or remorse, or just you know, them, working on relationships, And that was awesome"
"There are some genuinely funny moments in the film and some parts where I laughed out loud, but I think they're kind of few and far between that most of the time when there was humor"
sometimes it felt forced or it just wasn't funny
"Well, you can probably get a little bit of enjoyment from book-smart I don't think it's memorable and it's certainly not that funny"
"And really, I don't think it's worth the time or the money"
Certainly to rush right out and just drop all of your cash on it in the theater
Check it out on Netflix
Wait for it for Red Box
"Absolutely, because then you're not out a ton of cash"
"I mean, there are some redeeming points in the movie, but overall it was just kind of there"
"There's no violence, but there is sex nudity and a ton of profanity"
I give book-smart two and a half out of five couches
