hey everybody today I am going to be reviewing the film get out which is,0.06827623
the directorial debut for Jordan peel peel is of course known for being more of,0.052056532
an actor writer specializing mostly in in sketch comedy and things of that nature and,0.08335273
of course he was quite successful at that with the television show key & peele,0.04471614
and I think his comedy roots are very present here more so than you might,0.23850669
suspect by watching the trailer for this movie but to me this movie is almost,0.08229413
more of a hora D than just a straight-up horror film you know it's very,0.25470012
satirical it's cheeky it's mixing a lot of those horror cliches that we all know,0.34629962
and love from other horror films with a social commentary that is very very topical,0.13710691
and I don't think Pele could have picked a better time to write and make,0.06686923
a movie like this especially in the midst of such racial tension in such a,0.25788775
social divide Jordan Peele has said in a few interviews that he thinks that the,0.0984453
line between comedy and being afraid is very thin that there's almost no mine and,0.1082781
I kind of like that philosophy from him because I think he absolutely has a,0.08659214
point humor is often covering up fear or covering up discomfort in some way it's,0.0719686
almost like a defense mechanism but at what point does humor cross into becoming very,0.063619606
uncomfortable and then sometimes horror crosses over into humor I think they're both two very,0.15032458
exaggerated ends of the emotional spectrum and that's why they kind of bleed into each,0.3704458
other at a certain point I feel like when I film is getting me to,0.08508537
question things like that like when you're sitting there in a movie theater and you're,0.118899055
saying things like should I be laughing at that or oh that was really funny,0.0715475
but I kind of feel guilty about laughing that that's a good thing I think,0.1333237
that this film does that really really well and it does it through the vehicle,0.05885376
of exploring the minority experience which I'd say in mainstream Hollywood movies are especially in,0.07107461
mainstream Hollywood horror films you just don't see that very often this film is about,0.15370484
a guy named Chris he is a photographer he seems very easygoing very withdrawn he's,0.11700088
also black and he is dating a white woman named Rose they've been dating a,0.2213496
few months and they decide that now was the time for him to come home,0.06275676
with her for the weekend and meet the parents but she hasn't told them that,0.0702406
her boyfriend is black and as a white woman you know that's not something she's,0.46174496
ever had to think about so she doesn't really think too much of it she,0.14870411
kind of brushes it off says don't worry it'll be fine they're not racist bla,0.4444384
bla bla but obviously Chris has some concerns and rightfully so it turns out when,0.15532039
they get to the house everything just feels slightly off it's one of those things,0.082250856
where you can't quite pinpoint what it is but it's really bothering you almost kind,0.25372806
of like a pleasant bill sort of scenario and a lot of that first half,0.07105304
of the film is is kind of very much like a comedy of manners in,0.118331574
a lot of ways it reminded me of the film the invitation which I reviewed,0.059294727
last year and I mean this film is nowhere near as good as the invitation,0.09812187
at least in my opinion but it had this kind of this cheekiness about it,0.15667538
and this kind of forced facade of wholesomeness on the surface but in this film's,0.07538952
case it has that very bitter sour feel underneath of resentment and defensiveness from Rosa's,0.10717454
family against Chris roses parents also have a black maid and a black gardener and,0.021968754
the two of them there's something very off but they look almost like caricatures of,0.10453219
themselves at the same time they look like they could just snap at any time,0.23997527
in it's eerie but it's also as I said very satirical this movie reminds me,0.07963646
of something like the Stepford Wives which you know is partial parody and partial social,0.072978
commentary but my favorite scenes are the scenes that involve the family and Chris in,0.021436717
some way all of those earlier scenes the ones like the dinner scene that happens,0.12053969
their very first dinner scene or there's a big party scene later on the scene,0.12429968
where Rosa's father takes Chris on a tour of the house and again all of,0.05127014
these moments are trying to reveal that thin line between what should scare you and,0.1529296
what should make you laugh and sometimes that can be hard to pinpoint all while,0.11399712
making the racial repression feel very culturally poignant and it's very cringe inducing to watch,0.4047311
at times and that's that's the point and I think that teetering between humor and,0.08319293
discomfort is Peale's sweet spot that's working really I would say excels in terms of,0.11284501
his writing ability but I think he so has many areas that he could improve,0.13305975
on I think that he has a real struggle with tonal shift he doesn't really,0.09650117
know how to establish a tone in the horror aspects but I also think this,0.07857259
is his first movie and he is still trying to establish his directorial style and,0.062262
that's something that he'll learn with experience he'll learn to convey his point of view,0.13495077
in a more sharp way visually as well as through the content because for me,0.06322555
I feel like the content of this film is a bit too pointed at times,0.11324076
for me what is really strong especially in satire is when you distinguish the difference,0.08635313
between the black and the white and you focus more on the ambiguity on the,0.15172836
gray area and this film to me it relies a little bit too heavily on,0.1180801
more of the easy conceits and things that are right on the nose rather than,0.1506681
getting you to think for yourself ever due to movie a couple of years ago,0.13079076
called the sweet blood of Jesus and that was Spike Lee's crack at a horror,0.332342
comedy through the African American experience and well I feel that get out is a,0.23178154
much much more focused film and in terms of the narrative imitates flow I mean,0.08150336
sweet blood of Jesus is a mess it's a complete mess but at the same,0.55309504
time I feel like Spike Lee obviously has much more artistry and much more of,0.07809663
a point of view in terms of his directing style and even though I had,0.05963181
tons of problems with that movie I still really enjoyed it and I liked the,0.104714505
way that it handled ambiguity it took its themes into darker more interesting places and,0.05010546
I have to give him credit for at least trying that I feel like get,0.05617789
out starts to fall especially in the third act of the film past the halfway,0.10596028
point but more in the third act of the film it starts to fall into,0.053017385
a lot of those obvious traps when it could have opened those ideas up for,0.1338098
more exploration and I didn't like the direction that they decided to take the film,0.054465503
in because it lost so much of what made it special by kind of settling,0.070441954
into the genre conventions in a way that to me just wasn't nearly as interesting,0.14842285
as the first half and one of the big problems I notice and I got,0.111785024
to be careful here because I don't want to go into spoilers because this movie,0.06773084
it's very hard not to give away spoilers but what to me is so important,0.13874061
in a movie any movie I don't care what it is is strong motivation from,0.08558721
both sides obviously you have a protagonist and an antagonist in a typical story and,0.09850219
I think that you need to have motivations from each one that's what makes characters,0.06573099
more complex when you understand their reasoning for why they're doing what they do and,0.08117192
that's what separates the more interesting films from the films that decide to go more,0.060245764
the cut-and-dry hero villain good bad scenario I think there are two or three major,0.11359109
characters in this film and again I'm not going to give away which ones but,0.06534521
I feel like there we needed to see why they were doing what they're doing,0.064357616
rather than just seeing them as as as a movement of chaos and of hatred,0.32664794
when we understand their motivations that again makes them more complex but also makes it,0.05656885
more eerie because then you can kind of understand where they're coming from and sometimes,0.14861217
that can be a hard thing to deal with thinking wow I can empathize or,0.123160996
maybe sympathize with someone that I don't agree with and that can be difficult but,0.093350425
it also gives the film in the story more dimension and I wanted it to,0.040751368
go there but regardless of my criticisms I actually think this is a fun time,0.1177473
at the movies I think that people definitely should see it just go see it,0.076929234
with a bunch of friends have fun and then talk about it afterwards because that's,0.084286794
the key I think that this is it's so important for a film like this,0.068288594
to be coming out from the african-american point of view directed by a black man,0.63636404
and written by a black man we need more of that in the mainstream we,0.47691977
just need more filmmakers in the mainstream that have more diversity more diverse stories because,0.08441174
that's going to help us grow in terms of what we are willing to accept,0.05318488
because obviously people are known for kind of staying in their little bubbles and not,0.15055408
wanting to try anything new or accept anything that is new so when you can,0.10975225
really cross over into a horror film which again is a big mainstream sort of,0.16855107
thing that can be I think extremely important and that is my review thank you,0.061154366
