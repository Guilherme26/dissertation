if this movie gets any oscar recognition whatsoever music has to be part of that conversation write a music itself was just an array of emotions that I really done but even the supporting cast surprised me,0.074959725
oh I see a few comics in here a few comedians you might or will recognize Dave Chappelle and Andrew Dice Clay are both in this movie I didn't recognize Andrew Dice Clay for the longest time,0.11183841
so I was like usually when I see Andrew Dice Clay he looks like that he looks like the 80s just sneezes someone out in modern day it doesn't look like that in this movie looks like a normal dude plays Lady Gaga's father he's not in the movie much but I thought he was good for what he did same with Dave Chappelle,0.18568031
he's in like a scene in the movie but for what he did I'm glad that they're flexing their dramatic muscles,0.45694754
one of the other reasons I like this movies people glamorize the fantasy of dating a famous person yeah granted dating,0.21642433
this famous person actually helps her out was professionally speaking but one she wasn't looking for that but also to just personally it's different,0.115680896

there doesn't mean,0.030963257
there's not passion there means there's drama there,0.063690804
and one of the great takeaways from this movie that I personally had is how it shows when you rise in Fame and there are more moving parts to that machine,0.08097012
