really took everyone by surprise when john krasinski obviously you know from jim as jim,0.18460996
from jim in the office so he directed a horror movie starring him and his,0.23968679
wife uh where essentially there's these monsters who can't see but they can hear and,0.5876557
they have really good hearing so if you make a noise they're going to kill,0.69542736
you and so this movie's really about that and like the family's survival with that,0.12937166
concept but overall this movie is terrific this is my third time watching it and,0.058521394
honestly it gets better every single time john kozinski takes this kind of simple concept,0.23637913
of you know these monsters that can only hear you and they basically hunt with,0.6097451
what they hear um it's he takes that simple concept and really flushes it out,0.06901324
to perfection with really a really deep story that has a lot about like family,0.05591548
dynamics and really very a creative story with how he treats this concept of these,0.06228619
monsters but first this movie works so well as a horror film in the horror,0.29952502
genre first off it just feels very horror modern you know 2010's horror with how,0.17373799
it's shot it just it just feels that way but also it's pretty scary at,0.21115471
times it's not like super scary it's not like the scariest movie i've ever seen,0.24040398
but it is pretty scary at times but it's really more terrifying and suspenseful with,0.13409832
that's kind of the nature of the movie the concept of if you make a,0.06517903
sound you're gonna die that's real a really terrifying idea and the idea is really,0.4736911
done perfectly and really creatively like i mentioned like the stuff with the waterfall where,0.067860074
you can talk around the waterfall as long as it's louder that's really creative and,0.06618108
really all the like the cool stuff with like the lights and all these like,0.057995636
the fireworks and all this different stuff i have at the farm to kind of,0.06628256
combat this enemy i think it's it's really creative with what they do here and,0.21693578
that's definitely nod to the writers and the director as they just they do this,0.058323286
concept really well and that's one of the biggest strengths of this movie that made,0.050173093
it so great is that it's just you take the simple concept and develop it,0.0881302
so much to you just make it perfect like i've always loved the opening scene,0.111158244
alone where you know the kid has like the rocket ship and he just like,0.12611915
turns it on and he just gets killed by the monster john krasinski's running towards,0.7685299
him it's a super like bold opening um for a movie and i um it's,0.18285127
really sad and it's really terrifying but i really love it it's such a good,0.12562558
opening to a horror film i think i really want the best in my opinion,0.22262159
when it comes to your crazy openings to really set the tone of the movie,0.4159932
and it does that perfectly but overall this movie is just you know terrific with,0.0604962
the suspense and with just how scary the monster is but also this movie is,0.25540408
very dramatic with the concept obviously you know you have the daughter who's deaf and,0.35406458
you really have you know the family dynamic with that with john kasinski trying to,0.060399424
you know get make her a hearing aid and really um she ends up obviously,0.10851375
she's responsible for the kid dying in the beginning so then there's a dynamic with,0.25833464
that throughout the movie and then the wife is pregnant um and there's a dynamic,0.10372441
through that so there's a lot of like drama elements mixed in here that also,0.089096785
complement the story very well in my opinion and it really it gets pretty emotional,0.0621871
towards the end of the movie obviously with john krasinski you know getting killed and,0.55843735
sacrificing himself to save his kids in the movie and then when you see exactly,0.116162166
how much he was doing for his kids and for his deaf daughter obviously making,0.3648922
the hearing aids you know it gets pretty touching and heartwarming towards the end of,0.24129397
the movie with you just you see how much he was doing for them and,0.13317297
that definitely really helped the movie i think and it's just it's really nice how,0.06723105
they blended so much drama into you know a horror movie about a monster it's,0.5021716
pretty a nod once again to the director and the writers um with just how,0.054977506
well they did that and the family elements just work so well in this movie,0.05644688
and it definitely enhances the movie and takes it that next step in my opinion,0.09028485
the acting from pretty much all four or four leads i believe is really good,0.045797117
as well i mean you just get this really they all pull off this really,0.15158024
intense performance particularly emily blunt and john krasinski into two like adult lead roles this,0.16806985
they really convey the the the the tone of the movie just the suspense and,0.048447512
just how terrifying this world is um they really do a good job at conveying,0.13209909
that and that just once again it just helps the movie just be this you,0.14596036
know really almost a masterpiece of what they did here with this movie but the,0.05576344
acting in this movie is just terrific but possibly the best element you know obviously,0.07747702
the most no the kind of biggest takeaway from this movie was the sound and,0.15643439
the sound editing and the sound mixture and everything because obviously you have these those,0.06752647
dead quiet scenes where they're kind of they're being hunted and they just don't can't,0.24226177
make a sound um then you really mix that with you know these kind of,0.119726926
small noises that they're you know that they're allowed to make throughout the movie and,0.10167536
then you also mix that with like the score of the movie they mix that,0.080840416
in there as well um at different scenes throughout the movie but this the sound,0.054695148
editing is in sound mixing is incredible in this movie and it's just really like,0.104454614
next level type stuff and it's like unbelievable what they're able to pull off with,0.15074286
that and once again i'll go back to it a lot but it just it,0.09500145
helps convey the tone in the mat in the point of the movie with just,0.043601647
like these monsters hunting these people it really helps with that when you just you,0.5605209
have the sound which really is the most terrifying aspect of the movie but just,0.07786261
how well it's done and it really just makes you really terrified for these characters,0.06363267
as he really really pulls you in so overall this movie is just really an,0.1977104
amazing horror film in my opinion but my only negative with the movie and it's,0.1531675
kind of sort of a negative i think it could have used a little more,0.19341153
development the movie is only 90 minutes and about half of the movie is the,0.09616063
final act of the movie with emily blunt having the having the baby which is,0.15305193
really the main kind of arc in the movie um so that's really that that's,0.061624162
like half the movie i just wish there was a little more um obviously this,0.108694576
movie's really good so i do wish there was just more and more it was,0.051019084
longer in general because 90 minutes is pretty short especially for a movie like this,0.09565666
that move tends that does move really quickly um so i wish and i think,0.077364944
the emotion would have hit harder in this movie if there was just more a,0.08681985
little more character development it is pretty good everything is pretty good i just think,0.09946489
it could have been a little better in that regard not a huge issue for,0.05737882
this movie just something i can i kind of i wish there was a little,0.073665686
more development for pretty much everything in the movie but once again not a huge,0.089838326
deal with the nature of this movie and really like the sound stuff and you,0.11520635
know these monsters that can only hear those are going to be plot holes and,0.5876557
you know people are going to point those out but i'm not going to go,0.14978144
in depth with those you probably already know what they are um and i don't,0.10034163
really like i don't personally really care about them the movie is terrific in my,0.16587539
opinion i don't really feel a need to nitpick the plot holes they do hold,0.15112
the back a little bit just because there is some like the pregnancy during this,0.14993909
whole situation it's kind of a little kind of frustrating um but it's like that,0.1027454
that definitely adds to the movie the pregnancy that's the the concept that make one,0.055625543
of the most intense concepts of the movie so i'm completely fine with it i,0.074134015
get it um i don't want to pick the the plot holes in the movie,0.11694784
but it's they're definitely present and there might bug people more than they bug me,0.1652863
personally i'm pretty fine with it but anyways like i've kind of alluded to this,0.09958973
whole video on this movie is just really good as a horror movie but also,0.2991997
as a suspense kind of thriller kind of movie and as really like as a,0.1799165
drama the drama elements also really work here it's just terrific from the acting to,0.11691125
just how they treat the concept to the sound editing and obviously that great sound,0.05780062
editing how well that conveys the tone of the movie it's just everything in this,0.09365961
movie works and it's really it feels like a movie that shouldn't work but it,0.082437016
just works so well and it's really a nod to john kozinski here who does,0.1859388
a terrific job in directing the movie um and it's just this movie is just,0.12444631
an incredible experience it's really endlessly rewatchable i might have to watch it again before,0.05340672
a quiet place part 2 comes out because it's just it's so good and this,0.11447326
it's really short and that makes it really easy to watch um i know i,0.07199565
complain about it being underdeveloped but it being 90 minutes also makes it a really,0.1650536
quick watch like this movie flies by it feels like 30 minutes when you watch,0.11205536
it because it just there's it's so much happens in this 90 minute period so,0.065017484
anyways i think this movie is really really good so i'm going to give a,0.10149177
quiet place 90 and 4.5 out of 5 stars i think it's definitely deserving it,0.050794233
doesn't quite reach 5 stars for me maybe it will one day i hope it,0.068990044
does one day as it gets better with every watch but right now i'm just,0.07517247
gonna give it four and a half but like i said this movie is just,0.060948297
an incredible and unique experience and it's just you know it's one of the best,0.03106839
horror movies that we've gotten in recent years and i endlessly enjoy watching this movie,0.18165262
but anyways that's going to do it for my review of a quiet place i,0.07836884
