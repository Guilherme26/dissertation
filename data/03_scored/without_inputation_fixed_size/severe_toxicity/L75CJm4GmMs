you know I only got this jacket probably about a couple of months ago aberrantly,0.023469675
how much of an opportunity to wear during the summer even though it is pretty,0.023494286
lightweight the funny thing is that considering that's got a military s styling it's not,0.03648466
entirely accurate obviously but there were some patches on the shoulders most of which I've,0.034573585
taken off just weren't really my thing there wasn't actually American flag patches it's kind,0.12986779
of funny because I'm Canadian but I think it's about time that given this jacket,0.025962783
I might as well wear it during a movie review and actually talk about a,0.014324064
war movie for once hey there folks welcome to spectrum pulse we talk about music,0.07368039
movies art and culture and today in another unscripted movie review we're going to be,0.051414706
talking about the newest film from Christopher Nolan Dunkirk I think if you take a,0.023484308
look to a lot of guys especially guys my age in the 21st century and,0.06264567
ask them to name a filmmaker for which they admire and like most I bet,0.024442174
a lot of them would say Christopher Nolan and it's not entirely surprising as to,0.045415413
why if you take a look at a lot of films there's a certain hyper,0.03408534
masculine logic over a motion actually logic and structure and Duty over pretty much everything,0.04607328
that has run through a lot of films and for a lot of guys that's,0.0621215
a pretty powerful resonating force and if you want to all pretty much all of,0.058433056
its films like memento and insomnia and the prestige the Dark Knight trilogy Inception even,0.06596293
to some points interstellar although not really caused it to turn for an emotionality that,0.020936655
anything quite stuck the landing a lot of these films are based upon guys on,0.05546634
a mission or on some sort of deeply seated task and these are brought down,0.025108688
by their emotions or contradictions of duty or living forces of chaos and anarchy sometimes,0.057704017
you get that defined force I think one thing that I think Christopher Nolan does,0.026996478
not get enough credit for is a lot of the definitions of character that goes,0.013966196
into these stories the people who are actually facing the brunt of this chaos and,0.07193895
raw emotion ality for obstacles that that sort of brain cannot quite contextualize the things,0.19682717
that don't make sense and the fact that christopher nolan can so candidly construct these,0.035206176
characters even in broad archetypes that can be pretty powerful to tell these sorts of,0.022410702
very structured narratives and he'll probably in section is the biggest example when you have,0.048475925
all those interlocking layers of dreamscape nearly undone by that female presence in the mind,0.09536139
and yet walking out of it there is some still form that that was more,0.026771646
of an layer metaphor for filmmaking itself layer upon layer upon layer of production and,0.052654605
scripting so what happens when you get a film that's a little bit less about,0.060741246
that script a little bit less about that architecture and puzzle box around it but,0.034012835
least on the surface at least when it comes to the characters dialogue and more,0.014407213
about the concept of how the film is going to be structured and layered well,0.021992302
then you've got a film like Dunkirk and I will say this right out of,0.079263285
the gate the story of Dunkirk from a world war two narrative is not an,0.016633581
easy one to tell the Dunkirk evacuation Rutledge took place over a couple of weeks,0.030074948
of the coast of France coming in right after Germany has pretty much steamrolled through,0.078314066
the majority of Belgium and France and it's a losing battle it's an evacuation there,0.06665739
are hundreds of thousands of soldiers that are going to be quite literally driven into,0.04476686
the sea if they'll get destroyers or something that ferry them back across the channel,0.16566399
to get to back to Great Britain and there are not enough boats and the,0.064679794
big story here is getting those boats being able to fight off the Luftwaffe and,0.04120214
with enough air support and just getting those troops home getting them out of there,0.024445498
the problem with that is that telling that sort of story over a week-long expanse,0.027971638
of time that would probably be more suited to like an HBO miniseries it's the,0.027726185
sort of film that I think a lot of people would just say from a,0.031748552
structural vantage point would not really make sense here's where Christopher Nolan comes into play,0.02897806
here and the big twist to how this film is structured and I think a,0.024661684
lot of people have given him a lot of credit for it but I'm going,0.021883212
to dig into Weiss both a good idea and get a slightly hampering on the,0.10599435
first story is set among a bunch of marooned soldiers who are desperate to get,0.17774107
off the mainland and that takes place over a week of time then you have,0.026728408
the story of a couple people on a boat a family who is basically going,0.03406738
out and making one last dish chance to go out and then rescue whatever troops,0.020139765
they can that story takes place over a day and you have a squadron of,0.052041307
three fighter pilots that are going out and making a last-ditch cover run to drive,0.03960836
off any dive bomber saying the Luftwaffe before any of those boats across the channel,0.15473169
will get a hit or sabotage that story takes place over an hour of time,0.20403378
and all these stories are nested inside each other the week-long story then you have,0.05825612
the day long story and then you have the hour long story here's the twist,0.0237118
all these stories have been sliced up and placed somatically across each other so the,0.047126267
time seems to jump piece by piece by piece until they all come into alignment,0.36339915
at the one point in the third act climax it's novel I'll give Christopher Nolan,0.055418447
that in terms of structuring thematically it makes a lot of sense in terms of,0.03931967
structuring the narrative so that the tension is constantly maintained I think it's actually quite,0.10161212
ingenious in terms of being able so that each story has an effective arc and,0.0122447
arriving at the same rough point dramatically so that you don't have one arc that,0.023243513
is ended off before the other and then you get all your big actors having,0.15365675
enough screen time yeah that makes sense too I get why he did this here's,0.023459697
the thing when you realize that dick Euler structure comes into play once you wrap,0.6856459
your head around it you're then starting to see okay you're telling three arcs you,0.09584831
telling three pretty broad narratives in that broadness might work against the film's advantage because,0.02818383
and this is where it gets a little bit tricky because again this is where,0.052679885
I was asking and why was I struck before Christopher Nolan does have a skill,0.09379156
at emphasizing and developing up character and that doesn't really happen in this movie it,0.023313357
leans extremely heavily upon the actors playing these characters of the farce lines that they,0.036855165
have in order to flesh out some idea of that tension and hopelessness as they,0.14165418
feel remember they've got no backup coming they have lost this fight they need to,0.03175653
be able to go home and rally against and it that sense of hopelessness is,0.028886931
palpable the problem is is that when Christopher Nolan gives these characters so few lines,0.028657442
for all three main subsets of characters it can make things feel a little thin,0.027135503
a little bit too heavily reliant upon arc and relying on the actors to elevate,0.060480494
them and turn them into something more now don't get me wrong the actors really,0.115697384
put through the paces here particular mark Rylance as that riverboat captain in order to,0.04477684
haul people back T does amazing work basically trying to handle that stripped down straight,0.24237505
and proper common Englishman full that's able to make that one last-ditch effort really against,0.025904913
everybody's proper objectives including Killian Murphy who shows up as a shell-shocked soldier and really,0.17276482
kind of blew me away there just in terms of the subtlety of his performance,0.16395314
but then you also have characters like Kenneth Branagh who you would expect even a,0.026390497
much showy performance and he actually does its just really well in that particular role,0.020326016
as that to your master basically now having to stay behind in order to reconcile,0.06826314
with the Pythons effectively hopelessly at these people off and then you have the few,0.08875545
soldiers that are desperate enough and really they have names but you're not going to,0.023836857
remember them and the one I did recognize with Harry Styles and frankly he was,0.028553674
remarkably good in the terms of a role that ya requires him to emote and,0.020274132
pushes his character into some dark territory but at the same time like you and,0.082979
recognise that if you didn't know for one and for another it's also a case,0.025167223
where I wish his intensity felt more grounded in something that could have been explored,0.05022669
a little bit more through dialogue through a lot of these scenes and through how,0.045147344
a lot of this movie's visual language came together and then you have Tom Harvey,0.021144193
basically acting as the courageous British Air pilot and you know what credit to him,0.019070815
for doing as much as he can where he's got a face mask over most,0.083154604
of his face and because that calls back a little bit to Mad Max fury,0.24886861
road there but at the same time you've got with Max Rockatansky emotion was coming,0.023512911
from a George Miller film whereas for Christopher Nolan by obscuring so much of his,0.031514406
face with kids happening in the characters with his particular territory and Christopher Nolan films,0.032768942
it actually kind of mutes a lot of our emotional response when you're relying on,0.037109267
him to carry an entire arc of part of that narrative especially when he's running,0.036989532
out of fuel he doesn't know how much fuel yet and he's pretty much doing,0.06896558
a one-man flight in order to blow away and you look WAPA bombers and fighters,0.24008735
and you know what I will give Christopher Nolan a lot of credit for how,0.040878195
he films a lot of this it's a pretty bleak war movie in terms of,0.051632218
the amount of water and oil and slick gray metal shifters toppling over and the,0.023448389
fire and again the water that explodes in and the amount of dirt and a,0.13535489
Haggard desperation that translates through a lot of visual languages of film even in some,0.02191115
of the big hero shots they do feel a little bit muted because again this,0.13793913
is desperation a lot of it is very much gray scented duty they're trying to,0.03861923
do what they can and the acknowledgement that most of them will not get out,0.028973404
of this alive you could say it's a very British aesthetic when it comes to,0.104060665
putting together a film like this and the fact of this movie is so intently,0.04730387
British and almost detached from presenting a lot of it I can imagine it will,0.030760752
resonate very strongly with that audience my problem is that for as cleanly shot for,0.088854566
as dramatic as this movie is trying to be foreign heavily as it relies on,0.059252564
a score from Hans Zimmer that constantly has that ticking as emphasizing the background in,0.03295187
order to intensify an update tension in fact about how much this movie relies on,0.056147486
that score with so much of the film is shot with vast empty stretches of,0.08849936
water and land Nord emphasize the smallness of these characters again Christopher Nolan's command of,0.033848535
the visual language is good but there's a couple inaccuracies that got a little bit,0.115116015
distracting not Elise being you do feel somewhat detached from these desperate characters these desperate,0.028094696
men when they're given so little dialogue and basically a lot of it falls into,0.108626485
well we have to follow orders we have to get out of this we have,0.029588034
to go home and it tries a little bit to intensify the moral drama and,0.070337184
add some shades of ambiguity but it's a little hard to suck me in when,0.6687128
you also have several competing narratives they're going directly full force with probably Tom Hardy's,0.015343126
being the simplest of all of them and while there is some degree of complexity,0.091418184
again it's not exactly as involving when the characters feel has been or as archetypal,0.029856103
as they are then you have the baffling twist to go for a pg-13 here's,0.032023937
the thing about Dunkirk and I get that this probably makes sense when it comes,0.021957712
to a Christopher Nolan movie and that he's trying to emphasize the mechanical stiff the,0.03444853
duty found and yet there's no blood at all it's actually sunny when you have,0.07123917
characters who died in this film who suffer some pretty traumatic head injuries who get,0.0785216
lit on fire and a lot of the injuries a lot of wounds a lot,0.15847002
of the trauma that would have occurred in this evacuation it's not even shown and,0.025449926
it does take you out of the movie a little bit when you realize that,0.076548666
that does happen and it gets even more stark you don't see German fighters in,0.08907541
this movie and I get the reason why it was presented more as an impalpable,0.09199091
threat something that you know is there but you can't see because behind sniper fire,0.107852876
there's behind a war machine that is just not quite there in order to intensify,0.09955271
that tension the things that you don't see becomes all the scarier I get that,0.14142203
but it also becomes the point where you need to show something you need to,0.022640856
be able to pivot otherwise the tension just lies at a flat line and doesn't,0.046936687
escalate no matter how much sawing on the strings your orchestra does and again when,0.056825973
you have such archetypes they can work for fighting they are framed in a way,0.054042846
that allows you to empathize the characters allows you to get a little bit more,0.07094915
into what those characters are thinking allows show a little bit more subtlety and complexity,0.048789226
lean on that acting a little bit the problem is that Christopher Nolan is shooting,0.110628024
with big-ass IMAX cameras where Lanza shots will pan out to a wide shot and,0.666874
you don't tend to get those levels of acting subtlety that will grab but otherwise,0.03698155
come through and yet I guess that it's a war movie and a lot of,0.08626035
these characters are designed to be archetypes but at the same time when you have,0.01378061
that there's still ways that you can emphasize the emotional drama in tension without just,0.023334643
relying so heavily on the fact that this is a thing that happened I am,0.016055537
showing it for you all taken and as you will and when the musical score,0.022250393
comes up be sad or be otherwise inspired I don't know guys like I want,0.053063694
to like this movie but there's a part of me that feels a little detached,0.046488356
from it and it relies like I said Christopher Nolan isn't relying on character in,0.020085886
the same way that he's in with Cobb and Inception where he did with Harvey,0.08707786
Dent coming out of the Dark Knight or I did it out from Gary Oldman's,0.030636363
characters in the entire Dark Knight trilogy like there was an point and I just,0.035622578
wasn't getting it in Dunkirk the same way I was trying like their characters that,0.017957963
do bear mount there but when you're looking for the thematic underpinning so much that,0.033097543
this is just more filmed as if it is a historical documentary event with a,0.02895478
neat framing structure tune or to intensify the drama I can almost see the gears,0.031940125
working overtime behind the screen in order to put things all together but when you,0.025578972
remove certain things from the human experience of what actually happened in that historical event,0.15721083
the mechanical construction of the whole thing becomes a lot more apparent and that's when,0.02602265
you go for the SATs soaring moments of human drama they just don't hit the,0.13161989
same way they could yeah the score is powerful but Hans Zimmer and some subtle,0.034391325
acting work from Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branagh can only do so much here look,0.029673843
I know I'm ragging on this movie probably more and I get why people love,0.07134893
it I totally do because it's not going to make a hollywood-esque story of a,0.03484897
war especially when a war scene that would not otherwise be covered by as mist,0.10426288
Oracle fiction it was an American focus like I totally get why this is a,0.043992586
passion project for Christopher Nolan and it's shot and constructed in a way that clearly,0.094232574
makes it seem like it was a passion project but it also feels like it's,0.044325177
trying to do three different things there's one interview that I read that says suggested,0.013903668
that Christopher Nolan wanted to make that a dialogue free movie and you know what,0.024045724
if he was going for that sort of bleak harsh tone poem approach when it,0.034499086
comes to that sort of war I might actually be able to appreciate it more,0.0723161
it would make a little bit more sense but the problem is when the dialogue,0.06085765
constructs so many of these characters as archetypes and yet we're still supposed to respond,0.019706065
and Cheer when you have big broad set pieces and get all the way further,0.16290879
while intensifying this scenes of desperation of war in which there's no blood I don't,0.05181448
know I wish I had more of a connection to it but all these elements,0.07905575
seem to be working somewhat at cross-purpose and I can see the mechanism behind it,0.034358732
so much more clearly and yeah that does kind of take you out of the,0.06257981
film now am I saying this is a bad movie of course not I think,0.07918878
a lot of the acting for what we get it is pretty impressive against Killian,0.107927375
Murphy mark Ryland Harry Styles probably has a career in more movies good for him,0.0324889
he seems like the legitimate triple-threat in that regard I'll give him plenty of points,0.10490079
for that and you know what as much as I kind of rag on Tom,0.087086506
Hardy for not being able to see a lot of this and see him emote,0.056072988
in the same way acting he still does do an impressive job being that stalwart,0.022133986
hero I'll give him points for that and you know what I will say the,0.029645905
film is shot beautifully it's clear that Christopher Nolan put a lot of effort and,0.0634532
do this staging and architecture of this film but when you see so much of,0.024961682
the architecture it doesn't suck me in the same way that inception did or the,0.4282128
Dark Knight did and I can be very blunt about that as such as much,0.06175964
as I like this movie I'm giving it a light seven out of ten and,0.057473198
I know that is harsh and I fully understand accept that but I wish I,0.054113355
was emotionally pulled by this movie more rather than just marveling at its construction it,0.031670723
has emotional pull to it but that's because just hold on for a second because,0.021436874
I've read this it's a John Keegan book about the second world war and it's,0.10832117
actually pretty alarmingly comprehensive and describing all these initiatives it honestly feels a little bit,0.05227745
like Christopher Nolan read this book or read any real study about what happened at,0.03626781
Dunkirk and tried to film it as much historical accuracy as possible except when it's,0.047446884
not nor to intensify tensions cousin via tease a filmmaker and you know what I,0.063600205
get filming a book I get making that sort of adaptation of real events but,0.037060708
for a story with so much potential to draw out that level of human drama,0.08185949
when in reality you have so many stoic stone-faced characters that are if even the,0.04950563
ones who are shell-shocked are barely emotive at all it's a little hard to get,0.053029772
invested in the story I wish I could more but at the end of the,0.01973866
day Dunkirk leaves me colder than it should it was good you'll probably enjoy it,0.14415728
but I'm not seeing the high praise that somebody else have given it that's just,0.025161237
it sorry so yeah thanks Laura for watching you like to like and subscribe I'd,0.023075886
be more than grateful I know this will probably annoy some of you again I'm,0.09674564
a bit of a historical movie so I again I get why Christopher Nolan made,0.028149907
this movie and I can tell that it was a passion project and I can,0.039634302
tell the amount of core to the story you can tell he feels a connection,0.019193875
to this work an emotive connection I just wish that beyond the construction and beyond,0.04650698
the obviously choreographed moments in order to trigger that connection that we got more of,0.05190694
it and that it was framed better in order to emphasize some of those moments,0.036459383
coming out of the acting which in the most part it doesn't quite do as,0.033799313
much as I would otherwise like I think it's a good movie again not a,0.033214614
great one but hey if you guys have any opinions beyond that happy here in,0.047330476
the comments if you guys want to get involved in my scheduling so I don't,0.021971015
cover this movie two weeks after its release link to my patreon right there where,0.020882776
three times a week you guys get to vote on my schedule and once a,0.03994827
week you guys need to add records or movies to my schedule or details right,0.013378839
there but till then I'm mark you're watching spectrum pulse and I'll see you next,0.0532852
