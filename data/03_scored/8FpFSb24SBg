i'm going to be getting to but this one i really wanted to do as,0.08288498
soon as i could i don't know much about this movie at all i believe,0.14971966
it is about the day of the dead and it's about the main characters kind,0.19224115
of like ancestry and culture and kind of learning about that i know this movie,0.070656985
has such high praises so many people have said what an amazing movie this is,0.08184644
anyways that's really all i have to say about this i'm so excited to watch,0.14885631
so let's get into it oh i love this intro already i can already tell,0.13412271
this is going to be such a beautifully designed and animated movie the papa he,0.09049518
was a musician he and his family would sing and dance and one day he,0.08430685
left with his guitar and never returned they always gotta hit us with a sad,0.19426872
story in the beginning she didn't have time to cry over that walkway musician oh,0.0910889
okay after banishing all music from her life she found a way to provide for,0.17172307
her daughter oh you're a twig nico have some more no gracias i asked if,0.6049647
you would like more thumbnails i feel like grandmothers in a lot of different cultures,0.10798416
just love giving the grandchildren as much food as possible oh that's rough music is,0.09134119
amazing oh my gosh is this dog gonna be a main character wow i love,0.24192913
that dog nesto de la cruz took his first steps towards becoming the most beloved,0.20288607
singer in mexico is this going to be his great great grandfather that tore his,0.17992125
family apart until 1942 when he was crushed by come on what did the la,0.15255833
cruz always say seizure moment oh that's like his little mentor yeah i don't blame,0.133982
him for being terrified to tell them that he likes music if that's how they,0.084759474
react to this it's just poor dante follow you forever now go get my shoe,0.2425562
i love the humor in this so far all this work to bring the family,0.06706317
together look how beautiful that is coming home no mama it's okay oh this is,0.24015222
really cool because i don't know a lot about the day of the dead and,0.31089434
what the traditions are so i think that this is really cool that disney did,0.06399796
a movie representing a different culture and different traditions this music is so beautiful i'm,0.10904022
gonna play mariachi plaza if it kills me nothing we've all decided it's time joined,0.40656608
us in the workshop i'm sure he'll be thrilled to do that carrying on the,0.11958958
family's tradition i also don't trust that dog underneath there i feel like he's gonna,0.24050559
mess something up oh my god i knew it he was so close i knew,0.15308443
it i'm gonna be a musician what is all this you keep secrets from your,0.32439288
own family it's all that i mean yeah you guys react very poorly to anything,0.24876824
regarding music you said my family would guide me well de la cruz is my,0.15336484
family he's got a point oh god is she gonna break his guitar or something,0.44558936
i don't care if i'm on some stupid ofrenda wow that's beautiful oh god he's,0.7713903
gonna try and steal his guitar your great great grandson i need to borrow this,0.44288766
oh no i'm gonna play the plaza just like you did that is pretty terrifying,0.19493274
i oh is this his family yeah see i love that i hope he adopts,0.110987
the dog at the end and he becomes part of the family i'm pretty sure,0.14318332
i saw something like that shot in the trailer and i thought it was so,0.36868298
cool looking look at all of that oh your photos are in your son have,0.12628153
a great listen yes what about the worker they don't get to see their family,0.10971508
okay when i say that was pretty bad just now that that was a lie,0.21909805
and i apologize for doing that no photo that's really sad i don't know what,0.1008299
i do if no one put up my photo i know that sounds so depressing,0.16891447
you starve from the dead but i wasn't stealing the guitar it was my great,0.59992826
great grandfather's yeah don't say that in front of her you know she's the reason,0.086770765
why the whole family hates music i give you my blessing to go home to,0.49683902
put my photo back on the ofrenda and to never play music again what she,0.1119468
can't do that here we go mariachi plus here i come two seconds and you,0.2418404
already break your promise i've just had a really hard dialogue and i could really,0.1298261
use an amigo right now oh i'll be your friend oh you like de la,0.11016104
cruz he and i go way back i can get your front proceeds to his,0.11771821
sunrise spectacular show this is de la cruz no one's ever put up my picture,0.15425502
but you can change that this is okay so he's not de la cruz well,0.1957603
this is great because he needed a friend so now he has one one hiccup,0.35217574
the la cruz is a tough guy to get to and i need to cross,0.1846516
that bridge soon like yeah he definitely doesn't know de la cruz right he's just,0.39458707
lying about that hey you said you have real tickets that that was a lie,0.32213935
i apologize for that at least he's honest and feels remorse or maybe he only,0.10149547
feels remorse when he gets caught that's probably it actually and they go to drink,0.08773064
from the milk of their mother who is a cactus but also me and her,0.15415321
milk is not him this is quite an elaborate piece ernesto doesn't do rehearsals he's,0.15523861
too busy hosting the fancy party at the top of his tower i know where,0.15194704
we have to go i don't want to see your stupid face actor come on,0.93232936
my favorite character promise we'll bring it right back like the time you promised to,0.027672281
bring back my van or my mini fridge oh just yeah he has a bad,0.3131808
track record you okay i'm fading it i can feel it oh cause no one,0.11821244
remembers him why am i getting emotional oh yeah i'm with the dog on this,0.24643214
one when there's no one left in the living world who remembers you you disappear,0.436699
from this world oh that is so heartbreaking that was actually a question i had,0.07289714
in the beginning where it's like obviously families are honoring those in their family that,0.06763082
they love that have passed on but eventually if people stop having children in your,0.25131267
family everyone's gonna forget about you at some point if generations don't pass on these,0.118459545
stories and these people that's really sad is ernesto de la cruz going to be,0.18014611
really rude or not appreciative of miguel i don't know i'm just stressed about he,0.265473
idolizes him so much when he actually meets him i feel like people are always,0.09860345
so disappointed when they meet their idols okay even the dog is disappointed i'm nervous,0.21334466
for him you got this let's go hector's great don't go crazy he's a natural,0.5232622
i love their friendship oh my gosh this is one of the most wholesome and,0.11050699
pure friendships i think i've seen in a movie in a very long time why,0.10007834
do you have to ruin everything run away from his family they just want to,0.30999517
send him back to the line of the living room you said that was your,0.19351457
only family the only person who could send you home i do have another family,0.09334009
i could have taken my photo back this whole time okay this friendship crumbled a,0.081807345
lot faster than i thought it would keep your dumb photos stay away from me,0.76945144
now music's the only thing that makes me happy it's very selfish of the family,0.31089434
to be like you can't like music because one person that was mean to us,0.2207507
and screwed us over was a musician if my family was like this oh my,0.5154597
gosh i would be the same way as miguel i wanted to put down roots,0.42093378
he wanted to play for the world what's more selfish than leaving your family to,0.54725146
go do pursue music do pursue to go pursue music is to then ban every,0.21722093
single other person in your family from liking listening to playing music all right the,0.1103926
moment of truth is coming i'm so nervous for him this is like jay gatsby's,0.13123427
parties this is a lot he really had it there are you all right nino,0.071725205
my boy with a talent like yours how could i not listen okay he seems,0.463551
nice i have a great great grandson good okay i was really nervous he was,0.05925353
going to be mean or i don't know i am sorry to see you go,0.21691695

blessing and it's not going to work i give you my blessing you said you,0.3337271
take back my photo you promised miguel he told me he knew you hector please,0.09908449
began you're being forgotten and whose fault is that hector please those were my songs,0.2132516
you took my songs that made you famous being forgotten is because you never told,0.27096605
anyone that i wrote them that's crazy they let go no we made a great,0.316396
team but you died and i knew something was gonna go wrong he couldn't be,0.6076224
