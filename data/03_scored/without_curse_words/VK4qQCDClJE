I spread into it directed by Spike Lee produced by Jason Blum written by Atari,0.093446344

Washington David driver Laura Harry R and took your grace just Topher Grace and Adam,0.07788651
driver not David Ragan yeah thanks and yeah so guys story of black hansman what,0.4254434
do you guys think I mean usually when you run just well my role so,0.03306471
the story in black Klansmen is there is an african-american police officer who basically infiltrates,0.46401048
the Klu Klux Klan but they send his partner a white police officer in as,0.46090505
him so he is playing all the parts of the Klan member when they talk,0.22353369
to him on the phone but the other officer is the guy in person what,0.09331825
are you guys doing a story a super smart story lesson in history and obviously,0.10526482
on what's going on in present time mixed with comedy and real-life issues this story,0.09765727
bands I love it I think this story is just okay Jan I'm saying that,0.070326865
the general story like the story's good Jan I'm saying the story's good that this,0.044761214
platinum black african-american I don't know depending on where you are where the african-american officer,0.6722409
infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan I think that part miss lit the part where they,0.2633842
send in his partner also live there's other things in the story that I thought,0.085314244
I could have been way better but the general story of it is good I'm,0.05106198
gonna say originals I'm noticing about this before as well so yeah true story that,0.09017606
this guy is a rookie almost trying to prove himself and he kind of story,0.40322933
goes for something something like dangerous being african-american and then lucky saying he's bringing up,0.7217257
these guys and he's like I can't go so I'm gonna send my partner who,0.35718128
is dead also like Jewish the Ku Klux kind of also kind of hey he's,0.48655388
also kind of messed up hopefully like there's so many that confliction said so much,0.15048842
can go wrong but yeah you know go through the ties and stuff before that,0.10190992
was an interesting story no it's definitely a conflict of races and when I say,0.2754388
grace I'm just talking about skin color cuz we're all the same human beings but,0.48555538
it is just I like how the story puts in perspective these like watching the,0.058652487
story you know black white Jewish but then it's like you know two of them,0.556984
are kinda in the same pathway but in society it's gone a lot seemed that,0.07014213
way and even that Cara consult don't say that so I think that's really the,0.06241914
way they put it in a story with it decently decent so guys acting-wise used,0.0769723
to do do jeans down so much what you guys drink for me Adam Drybar,0.1525345
kylo Ren them so I feel like Adam driver it's a super legit in this,0.10748551
movie John David Washington who the main character is as well both of these two,0.07148868
I just love the dynamic how they bounce off each other the it's like just,0.24536994
just the chemistry between them is is it's interesting because it's like you know they're,0.05872893
on the same team but like one's putting his life at risk to satisfy the,0.11599179
other ones need to I don't know what to express himself or to to that,0.09609004
to fight his crusade you know I'm saying I well Adam drivers characters like not,0.13286808
feeling as emotionally tied to it as he should my issue that position yeah I've,0.14016236
got a jump on that as well because I think that's that's that's the real,0.13312957
balance of things about this movies that we all go in with the expectation discount,0.05415872
has been main thing would be obviously about this black guy but then he's not,0.6654268
the one like I said inside in that scenario you know in the midst of,0.082394294
of the KKK so and other drivers character finds himself and it kind of reveals,0.11096253
like who really is which he kind of like was brought there by a meaning,0.081868075
not that it was his fault but he was just because of his upbringing and,0.24101421
he's like oh like well this is bigger than that for you know he's not,0.14499314
only your Crusades over a smile as long as some so protected so I really,0.19308005
think those two character waste like you said down the way they've bounced him looks,0.35733882
really great yeah I do also like a David John David Washington and Adam driver,0.10362497
Jackson but I damn sure don't know how this movie would be carried on is,0.5154597
other actors who stood out and play their part well no see that kind of,0.06817582
hate enforcement kind of guessing that they did their part yeah definitely like the main,0.2785726
office not I mean officer that the chief of the whole Police Department he was,0.07918918
an from the beginning you kind of know what he's trying to do they like,0.06760269
are you something oh you know I like the Ku Klux Klan he was kind,0.38763133
of being a dick about everything yeah yeah I kind of like the way who's,0.8785311
know what I can read his current from buddies almost like a fool everyone was,0.7322509
almost like that on that side of the team but then not like the way,0.091679886
he's firing his calls he's like going some - about it but usually like this,0.24278985
kind of but you know that's how you know for ya David Dunn what's your,0.07715126
driver like them too like he goes what he said like with chemistry carry the,0.06984887
movie good acting yeah I think it's fair to say that also created to to,0.0863801
the gas on opposite team because they acting made me feel some type of words,0.24245834
on which just shows the way they deliver death their side of it so you,0.5258265
know I like the production is a level of this movie I like how there,0.059504505
were some scenes shot dutifully the contrast between two stories you know who is basically,0.108363576
who's saying what to WHO so basically the audience know you're talking to and there,0.078629896
are some specific scenes very very powerful things that actually goes on today but then,0.055681583
I also feel that the what they've implemented in which is the history of what,0.044040266
as you know African Americans as you would say have gone through and what they've,0.53490317
implemented into kind of like educate a new generation because I thought that some things,0.09913626
they would sit would have said some people with a picture but for others who,0.09937128
are not so up they're not from that generation you just find in that name,0.11046162
you know would satisfy you know you wouldn't really gave just you know we just,0.08755482
wouldn't do anything really so having certain images and scenes really really great and seen,0.116020076
oh my goodness breathtaking yeah I think he was just mainly about showing what's going,0.09677353
on in the world and how we've been having this conflict for god knows how,0.15155052
long production-wise i feel like as a whole it was alright i thought that there,0.05474315
was some really epic scenes i feel like there was some really scenes that kind,0.06317848
of took me out in the movie as well so i call that production cut,0.10886691
me might be like one of the downfalls of the movie I thought like overall,0.15336825
it was okay she let me say I feel like there was definitely some scenes,0.15127721
that I was like don't need this don't need that but they were also superseded,0.17652734
by some scenes of and laziness where I'm like this is so sick I wish,0.3561455
there was more of this do not save so in any kind of balance that,0.0614722
I saw but I just thought like this this is probably the only everyone thought,0.07741971
that this movie could have done that was when like major high and it went,0.06454003
super low they gave us a in way is is facing the basically they're saying,0.08590646
so like it was right everything felt like he was in place even the way,0.11413713
was like the looks or the way was sure felt like it was a whole,0.073674805
new destroying those kind of times everything saying those cool but there was some shots,0.31089434
that were big wave minute when he don't playing some scenes I was like that,0.08124573
wasn't made the key for you to do that movie it's a movie that everybody,0.10039375
must watch especially because what was going on the world it's very very fun a,0.086087
funny movie but at the same time with serious issues and obviously something that you,0.1674415
can we all as you know you would be as we joke about by the,0.15086822
same time is soon as so it's just an aspect of just being human being,0.15260139
you know with every comedy has you know truth to it I think the movies,0.14949946
really good I really like here I thought like it's lacking the level of depth,0.15166986
that I thought I was gonna get with the movie especially it being a spy,0.12307053
TV movie I thought like it was gonna go a bit deeper but it didn't,0.06943967
but even with that lack of depth is still really good moving I do think,0.12333839
that like hey watch it watch it cause in the crime of what we live,0.23994331
in today while I like about the movie is the way showed you one side,0.07974251
or what people were preaching in the other side of what people were experiencing I,0.078239925
can sum you don't really get up too often and they reached on this wall,0.09491395
especially in certain scenes where you saying one person will be doing this and that,0.058923405
and it's kind of conflicted whatever people or people who are doing it another scene,0.11026695
and that goes to show her what the movies trying to portray and like it,0.10515677
really just I'm from in this kind of movie but some that this is a,0.0631287
direction a little bit didn't we missed you all the whole movie like wasn't Reagan,0.08048248
it's a for me oh my gosh the TCA official rating for this movie black,0.5154597
can't even gets a full sofas if let movie guys let us know in the,0.23408456
comments down below what you think what the movie is that lit for you broken,0.24159914
sofa is it dead legit we want to know I'm sorry mister blitzed and I'm,0.40309697
