okay if you just saw Logan and you did not walk out completely blown away,0.31089434
I have one thing to say to you so Logan tells the story of a,0.08763198
way past his prime Wolverine that goes on one final adventure after meeting a very,0.064905174
mysterious young girl this is the tenth x-men movie the third Wolverine Side Story and,0.26190197
the final time that we're gonna see Hugh Jackman portray the character of Logan oh,0.036508124
oh it's so sad to say those words out loud because people this is not,0.08766984
only one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen it's not only the,0.076692894
best x-men movie that's out there this is the best that we've seen Hugh Jackman,0.13442725
be in the role of Logan and Wolverine and it's the last time we're gonna,0.061541148
see it I've just why now the story in Logan is easily the most grounded,0.045989882
the most gritty and the most downscaled story that we have seen in the x-men,0.18528442
film universe yet and it totally works to this film's advantage because that's the tone,0.09718185
that they're going for with the story and the tone of Logan the trying to,0.029607514
go for this gritty grounded tale and that is exactly what you get I really,0.14909565
liked how this story kind of slowly evolved throughout the runtime you start off and,0.09944019
you're getting introduced to this past his prime Wolverine to this dying Professor X and,0.2582146
it really just seems like you're waiting for these characters to perish and then they,0.16934368
get thrown into this situation with this new girl and it becomes a road movie,0.2426449
there's a little bit of the post-apocalyptic flavor in there there's a little bit of,0.08991261
comic-book flavor in there mostly dealing with this group of mercenaries chasing down Logan and,0.23990272
Patrick Stewart and x-23 but really the movie's not even about that struggle it's not,0.066648245
about them trying to escape the villain it's more about Logan facing himself and facing,0.10016226
his mortality and really trying to rediscover his heroism trying to rediscover why he became,0.12748839
Wolverine in the first place why he tried to save so many people throughout this,0.07237038
film franchise why he tries to be the good side of Wolverine and it was,0.056388136
pretty incredible seeing him go through that transformation really it was like they were trying,0.08994554
to get Logan to kind of rediscover himself and get back to where he was,0.15053986
morally and heroically in the beginning so that he could end and that's why this,0.072057955
movie has the perfect title this is not the x-men this is not the Wolverine,0.14018175
this is Logan it's because this movie is about who Logan is underneath all the,0.078213155
blue underneath all the pain underneath all the larger-than-life stories that he has gone through,0.10719313
in the legend that is the Wolverine who is Logan what is Logan down to,0.097223885
his soul you know when you hear a lot of people talk about amazing performances,0.13336894
in comic book movies you often hear the same names you hear Heath Ledger's Joker,0.17358483
you hear about Robert Downey as Iron Man but you know what Hugh Jackman beats,0.093411565
all of them for his portrayal of Wolverine not only does he just live and,0.23138955
breathe the character of Logan and Wolverine but he's been playing this guy for 17,0.13821328
years and I'm thinking about it and not just just escaping comic book movies for,0.09426909
a bit I can't think of another actor that has dedicated so much to one,0.08583321
singular character like Hugh Jackman has to overing from the first time that we got,0.106854394
to see this guy just in that cage fight when he turns around with a,0.32956693
cigar and just has that animalistic look to him we're just like that's him and,0.18887514
through all the ups and downs this x-men film franchise has been through with some,0.12744415
really great movies and some really shitty movies the one constant in all of it,0.8060606
is Hugh Jackman is always amazing as Logan and what I just saw was Hugh,0.070751674
Jackman take all of the 17 years of experience that he's had with this character,0.08749128
and end it on the highest note possible I'll tell you what people this is,0.10525281
gonna be one of the hardest roles ever to try and recast because like the,0.049991447
old saying says you can't top perfection it's gonna be hard to talk about anything,0.14994362
else in this review guys because what Hugh Jackman just delivered was nothing short of,0.08203958
an amazing performance I mean this guy this is the Wolverine that he has been,0.16195694
wanting to give us from the time he first put on the claws this is,0.15260756
easily the most human that we've seen Wolverine he's facing his own mortality he's facing,0.1084322
living a life where he just constantly sees all of his loved ones die around,0.48791692
him and he just out lives everybody and he's facing himself in this movie just,0.26389223
as much as he's facing the outside influences and the villains in the story it's,0.06373107
also the most insane that we've seen Hugh Jackman's Wolverine to words people berserker rage,0.478528
I was not prepared for how bloody and violent this movie was gonna be for,0.5365864
those of you that wanted to raid a tower Wolverine you got it Logan went,0.22515543
way beyond just seeing Wolverine stabbed a bunch of guys with his claws you could,0.5542981
limbs taken off people get decapitated you see so much carnage in this it's wonderful,0.70614606
granted it's not something you need to see with every single comic book character but,0.07035237
this does really excite me for what doors this movie might open for some rated-r,0.36719602
comic book movies going forward but as much as I'd love to talk about Hugh,0.08574092
Jackman for another 25 minutes there's another actor that we are saying goodbye to in,0.08037445
a beloved role this is Patrick Stewart's final performance as Professor X we get to,0.09994225
see a much different shade of his version of Professor X in this movie you,0.18190055
know there's a very different style between James McAvoy Professor X and Patrick Stewart Professor,0.111438446
X and the Patrick Stewart Professor X that we get to see in Logan is,0.059684914
like a third shade he's a much more grounded a much more greedy and realistic,0.41953483
version of Professor X he's weathered he's been through some just like Logan has Hugh,0.14903834
Jackman and Patrick Stewart have always had great chemistry with each other in these movies,0.09788348
but it was firing on all cylinders in this the humor is great back and,0.15988429
forth there's a lot of really really gut punch emotional moments in this between those,0.21538073
two characters and it's a really bittersweet send-off for both of them because you've been,0.16556615
with both of them for almost 17 years and it just feels like a fitting,0.06071108
way to end both of those characters and to send-off both of those actors portrayals,0.24494596
with each other now the new character that were introduced to in this movie is,0.06574343
x-23 played by Daphne Keene and you know what in a movie where it's really,0.06305257
built on not only nostalgia and not only this bittersweet send-off for these two actors,0.24078937
that we've been with for so long and we're really focusing on them I was,0.076078214
focusing just as much on x-23 she was a great character not only was she,0.10423074
just as badass as Wolverine but from the second she walks onto the screen you're,0.23975639
interested in her you're intrigued by her you like her you think she's cool and,0.14159639
you really want to see what's gonna go on between her and Wolverine and Professor,0.28282148
X and that says a lot about this little girl's performance because for the first,0.18564646
two-thirds of this movie she doesn't even say a word I don't know if we're,0.19017448
gonna get to see more of X 23 I don't know she's gonna continue on,0.09501645
in this franchise she's gonna be part of the New Mutants or we're gonna see,0.15283798
her in some further x-men apology movies but I love her character and I want,0.12901843
to see more of her and she fits right in with Hugh Jackman and Patrick,0.1454656
Stewart without missing a single beat she has the chemist with those two almost like,0.08529336
she's been around since beginning of this franchise now the villains in this movie are,0.17009315
a group of mercenaries called Reavers their leader is called Donald Pierce and he's played,0.37660587
by Boyd Holbrook and he's a really cool villain he's not really like this big,0.24114004
larger-than-life villain that were used to seeing on the x-men franchise he's not a mutant,0.23204927
he's not somebody who has like all these powers in this grand world-ending scheme he's,0.16870481
just a small little villain that works for the small movie and the way that,0.15305369
his villain is used is much more close to what the MCU does with their,0.20875384
villains where it's more of a plot device that's used to propel the story forward,0.1488894
you're not really supposed to focus too much on the villain he's not supposed to,0.15386973
overtake the heroes and they executed that really well in this because he's not really,0.20156029
somebody that you're gonna walk away thinking man he was such a badass villain but,0.6542445
he was used really well to propel the story to where it needed to go,0.08592166
for Logan Professor X and x-23 and Boyd Homburg does really good in the role,0.06537513
now aside from all the great performances and characters that we've got in this movie,0.056856465
the other biggest star of Logan is James mangled now this guy has directed some,0.10387938
damn good movies in his lifetime he directed cop Lane was Sylvester Stallone really really,0.6708991
underrated cop movie he directed 3:10 to Yuma the remake with Russell Crowe and Christian,0.12887973
Bale one of the best westerns that I've seen in a long time I really,0.10949352
enjoyed his previous x-men movie The Wolverine even though the third act kind of fell,0.17702457
apart but really his direction in this movie as flawless as it is makes me,0.1230253
really wonder what we would have gotten out of the Wolverine had he had the,0.081301324
gloves taken off and was able to make the movie he wanted to make which,0.10683079
is clearly what he did with Logan because not only did he direct this movie,0.09618171
but he came up with a score story of the movie and he also co-write,0.07280478
the script with two other people so this was really James Mangold's brainchild and what,0.09597913
I appreciated the most about his direction in this movie aside from the amazing action,0.081982136
scenes aside from getting some of the best performances that we've seen in a long,0.08927493
time and especially in this franchise but he uses a lot of really really subtle,0.0718988
details and his filmmaking in this movie which I love there's a lot of subtext,0.14534956
there's a lot of little minding details that aren't really shoved in your face they,0.3575843
give you just enough information just a little bit of a nugget to give you,0.32378677
an idea and they let you fill in the rest of the blanks yourself and,0.18455203
I love movies that do that because too often nowadays we get movies where they,0.0680091
just feel like they have to over explain everything and I really like how he,0.053776577
set this story in a dystopian future that doesn't go to over the top with,0.06617466
a dystopian thing it's not really like a big post-apocalyptic world like Mad Max fury,0.24719882
road it's not super futuristic it feels like modern times for the most part but,0.09570301
there's just subtle little things thrown in there like these little automatic semi trucks that,0.15039013
go down the road that's futuristic and the fact that mutants aren't around anymore this,0.16575278
has taken place at a time where mutants are all but dead some kind of,0.29120013
event happened that wiped out almost all of the mutants and another one of those,0.18407431
so details I was talking about they don't tell you exactly what happened they give,0.08892966
you enough a little bit of information throughout the movie to kind of figure it,0.12033518
out for yourself or come up with some kind of an idea yourself and that's,0.17540967
all you need we don't need it to be spelled out for us and I'm,0.117478296
glad they didn't above all else one thing that James Mangold really nailed in this,0.10875027
movie is the pacing because not only is this some of the best pacing that,0.06807364
I've seen in a comic-book movie it's some of the best pacing I've seen in,0.09127827
a movie in a long time it opens up with this awesome scene that just,0.059982035
grabs you by the throat lets you know what kind of a Logan movie you're,0.6364068
in for and you were just along for the ride and you have some great,0.123151444
action scenes you got some really emotional moments and the movie just continuously rejuvenates its,0.13702308
energy throughout the runtime of this movie it just rejuvenates the audience's interest in this,0.094134346
story in these characters all the while maintaining the fact that it is a very,0.040652018
grounded and greedy story and not one point in this movie does it jump the,0.18987302
shark and go off into the stupid territory like the last 15 minutes of the,0.8785311
Wolverine Logan stays on course from the time it starts to the time the credits,0.062189188
roll and when those credits roll people I don't care what kind of preparation you,0.15660149
went through what kind of counseling and what kind of group therapy you had before,0.10154291
you walked into Logan when that title screen comes on and the credits roll and,0.06868813
you realize this is the last time you're going to see Hugh Jackman's Wolverine this,0.09871252
is the last time you're gonna see Patrick Stewart's Professor X you're gonna shed some,0.1681929
tears so on that note to wrap all this up guys Logan is not only,0.11528363
one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen it's one of the best,0.08119582
movies that I've ever seen this is not your typical comic book movie it almost,0.1925878
seems like it's doing the movie a bit of a disservice to put it in,0.26152754
comic book movie genre because this is something entirely different this is the best performance,0.08422709
you're gonna see from Hugh Jackman in his long 17-year reign as Wolverine this is,0.16882098
the best performance you're gonna see from Patrick Stewart in his long 17-year reign as,0.103679396
Professor X we got a great new character in x-23 who I'm really crossing my,0.11095468
fingers we get to see going forward and the further x-men movies because she was,0.15057826
badass and above anything else it's just really great to walk into a movie with,0.54277754
this big sense of finality and these characters that you have spent almost 17 years,0.05196347
with and you not only walk away satisfied but you walk away completely enthralled so,0.10893559
grab some popcorn some drinks and a box of tissues and be prepared to be,0.1522159
amazed by the incredible movie that is Logan and once you're done checking it out,0.05920584
in theaters definitely go out and buy it so what did you guys think of,0.055979166
Logan do you think this is a great way to send off Patrick Stewart and,0.09917978

movie that you've seen in a long time or were you disappointed in it put,0.24118456
