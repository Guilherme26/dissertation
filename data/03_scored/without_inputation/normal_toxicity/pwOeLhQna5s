today I want to talk about the new thriller a quiet place directed by John Krasinski who also stars in this one alongside his real-life wife Emily Blunt I was excited for this movie it definitely had my curiosity I enjoy the blending of the horror genre with that of the suspense thriller I do think this blending of genres is really great for getting both satisfying elements of the horror and the McCobb as well as much more potentially fleshed out characters than you get in your traditional can't be slasher flicks all things,0.11359072
I think this film was able to pull off because I had a great time watching it,0.09283502
and despite my excitement to see it it was really better than I was expecting it was very well paced,0.12682112
it provides just enough character development and has a strong collection of performances as well as a story with an organized plan and a very well-crafted approach,0.041430917
so let's talk about the story a little more,0.05569028
I thought it was very intriguing and has a short runtime,0.0975204
so things get going very quickly,0.081872635
it's a very contained film,0.15057334
there are minimal subplots to pull your attention from the main issue facing these characters which I thought was very effective in keeping the tension constantly high the plot keeps us focused on the specific family you just enough substance to really understand the ramifications of all the threats that they face but there were some nicely placed tidbits that captured,0.09631647
the fact that there is a world going on around them,0.0856323
and I thought it was a nice added element of mystery,0.059710663
the storyline keeps a swift pace,0.06223324
it has a great overall focus,0.06125382
it spends the right amount of time developing the dynamics between all the various family members really placing you into their lives in a very intimate way but it also has the perfect amount of more tension filled moments to really switch gears and it was a nice flow between the two of those which leads us into the character performances which I thought were all very good Krasinski and blunt shared a strong believable chemistry with one another,0.07529241
they really had to rely on a lot of physical acting to capture emotions and moods,0.067086875
and I thought both were able to really do some great things without the use of dialogue you really grow to like these characters you can connect with them,0.08535013
you can put yourself in their position,0.31089434
and it really adds a nice intriguing dimension to this film,0.0789264
you really care about these characters through their performances and it makes those more intense moments hit that much harder and the performances from the younger cast members were solid as well I used to think that kid actors would either could break a film but over the past,0.07658842
handful of years there really has been a strong uptick in the quality of younger performers,0.06670855
and this film was no different with noah Joop and Millicent Simmons both bringing some very natural performances to this storyline,0.09589319
now let's talk direction and cinematography to more strong aspects for this film,0.07694375
the direction was simple but I really thought it was effective in capturing all the implied tones the settings and backdrops were all perfectly selected for this plotline it felt very isolated and imposing and with a nice use of lighting and camera angles you really can feel the ominous routine of their lives,0.09627514
and the intensity from that constant threat of attack,0.16772906
I thought the camerawork also used nice angles and very nicely times slow pans to build suspense instead of using cheap jump scares which was fantastic,0.15407225
this movie also utilized sound or lack of it very nicely,0.13082774
there were some long bouts of silence and when it would implement sounds from either the musical score or from nature or sound effects or some of the minimal bouts of dialogue it really would stand out there was also some moments where the musical score really did a great job of amplifying the moves of specific scenes very effectively and overall for a film that relied on his characters to make no noise,0.05091244
it really did use sound to its advantage so overall I'm gonna give a quiet place 85 percent on the entertainment meter,0.102241814
I thought it was a great time and has strong horror elements as well as some very powerful tension that will have you locked in from start to finish,0.32666367
there are some things you have to overlook and some gaps in logic due to just lack of explanation overall but there was more than enough here,0.09025286
to connect with from a character aspect,0.10256643
as well as on the story side,0.041233804
and I definitely recommend checking it out I had fun with it,0.09804423
