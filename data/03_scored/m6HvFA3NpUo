a direct sequel to 2015's Mission Impossible rogue nation So this movie contains a couple,0.15541796
of firsts for the franchise first off it is the first time that they have,0.048462044
ever done a direct sequel to the previous film the other movies in this franchise,0.076529875
are standalone stories with relational connections to the previous films this movie is a direct,0.05816916
sequel to the story of 2015's rogue nations So I would highly recommend that you,0.2600634
re watch rogue nation before you watch this film the second first in this movies,0.34695315
It's the first time that a director has returned to do a second movie in,0.057467557
the franchise Chris McQuarrie directed rogue nation And he's come back to direct this film,0.37224358
as well because it is a direct sequel to his other film rogue nation But,0.2782439
before I give my thoughts on the movie if you love to talk movies so,0.094525695
much so that your friends think you talk too Much about movies go ahead and,0.14271742
join us down in the comments section We would love to talk movies with you,0.18246764
all day long Tell us your thoughts on this movie as well as the franchise,0.1107005
in general with that said let's get started talking about the good what I love,0.051836323
about this film is the World-building sort the sixth film in this franchise and what,0.05732224
it wisely does to distinguish itself from the previous five films is try and tie,0.06952106
The world together of this franchise what I mean by that is we start to,0.100741595
understand There's some direct Sixth the film and that just makes us feel like this,0.044007644
"is a bigger world Not just these kind of cool standalone stories, but in a",0.06423665
world that's being inhabited by these characters along those same lines It continues the themes,0.09104912
from the previous film about the consequences of actions and in doing so we start,0.049923662
to dig a lot deeper Into Ethan hunts character instead of him just being seen,0.12505975
as kind of like this unstoppable Action hero this movie dives into his psyche and,0.1520385
the consequences of everything that he's gone through in the previous times It takes a,0.104384266
toll on him and we start to get little pictures of what that looks like.,0.09984454
Another thing The movie does well is it gives us a very clear Story we,0.055934414
know exactly what Ethan is trying to get the warheads and what the consequences Are,0.086660534
if he doesn't get to them in time This also gives a sense of urgency,0.083703
in tension throughout the entire film and what gives the movie complexity is the different,0.046708163
"characters and their motives, and we're not always sure what Everyone is trying to do",0.06154277
in each scenario and who is betraying who in each situation? So while the basic,0.18826924
story is fairly straightforward it has a lot of nuance to it because of the,0.040210433
interesting characters that Populate the film speaking of interesting characters this movie has an amazing,0.0767096
cast now we know the returning cast are great in these roles and have amazing,0.031225717
chemistry with one another but we had some new favorites into the mix with Angela,0.075472295
Bassett as kind of this higher up in the government who's not Necessarily on the,0.14654958
side of the IMF and who sends along an operative Henry cavill to kind of,0.06637725
try and watch over the team and make sure these nukes are returned No matter,0.17013134
what and Cavill just makes form. It's an interesting role for him He's playing against,0.08101493
his usual type where he's playing the charming lead here. He's kind of while he's,0.24349768
on the team. He's Antagonistic towards the team and just makes for an interesting fun,0.097644396
kind of tension and dynamic to see him in a different type of role He,0.10060459
also has an amazing mustache in this movie that had dire consequences for the movie,0.19695736
"Justice League I tried to do my own little Henry Cavill mustache, but I forgot",0.20674324
to grow it out starting a week ago so I didn't really pull it off,0.08026956
as well as I would like to but he pulled off the physicality like you,0.4284251
feel him as a physical presence in the room and he plays against Like the,0.10602913
the jokey humor of Simon Pegg and you know the Tom Cruise grin and everything,0.24212086
like that So he's just an interesting new dynamic to add in to the mix,0.08896348
here Also the villain from rogue nation returns in this film I've been critical of,0.2751769
him and rogue nation because I thought that character just seemed off Visually the way,0.2457517
they made him look I just didn't make him feel scary and intimidating to me,0.11247477
and that's different in this film He just has a different look because of where,0.077704936
he's at in life and what's happened since the previous film and he he fits,0.14760736
the role much better in this film and gives off the right vibe and Menacing,0.23964298
ambience around him. Once again the action here is great whether you're talking about motorcycle,0.16888857
chases through crowded Traffic filled European cities or helicopter chases with Tom Cruise Dangling underneath,0.18427032
the helicopter as usual for this franchise. The action sequences are memorable. They're iconic They're,0.058573026
exciting and they're just shot So well like in this movie there's kind of an,0.4112881
infamous stunt in the movie where Tom Cruise got injured and the film was delayed,0.122206345
for a couple of months and They'd showed kind of the shots of It in,0.10010477
some of the trailers a little bit and they kind of would there have been,0.074118555
some leaks of the footage on like TMZ? and stuff like that the shot in,0.13074762
the movie is Awesome. I mean just so well choreographed if you kind of know,0.15140127
the history of the accident and everything like that You know what? It's coming and,0.118035965
it's it's great if refrigerates That's had quite a few great Hand-to-hand fight sequences the,0.071111865
bathroom fight in this one might be the best hand-to-hand fight scene inside of the,0.13395016
franchise and one final Positive while the movie has all the action that the film's,0.055156287
are known for it also has all the spy trickery that the TV show is,0.052978043
known for with the masks that disguises the sets all the Fun spy stuff where,0.1348582
they're just kind of messing with people's heads It's got all the stuff that Mission,0.18458636
Impossible is known for from there We will move on to the bad in the,0.096781395
big- on this film Is this just a lot of things about the film that,0.08342126
"were very? Predictable and for me, I rewatched all the films in the franchise over",0.07358855
the last month And so maybe I've just got a lot of Mission Impossible on,0.068396576
"the mind. I'm thinking very mission of possible esque, but every single time there is",0.043508526
a moment in the movie where there's a bit of a reveal where the audience,0.055616345
would a little bit I Saw it coming at the very beginning of the scene.,0.08441695
I knew what was about to happen every single time They tried to pull a,0.08440024
trick on the audience. I can see it coming This is both true of individual,0.11022747
sequences as well as the story overall also with the film I feel like it's,0.035104483
almost victim of our expectations of the franchise and what I mean by that is,0.09029135
that Several of the last films have had so many of these iconic stunts that,0.07236242
the level of Expectation has gotten a little bit too high So going back to,0.10592548
that Dubai sequence where Tom Cruise was dangling on the outside of a building and,0.06623441
then they followed that up with Tom Cruise's dangling from a plane as it takes,0.08371539
off That's just the level of expectations so high that there's not really Anything you,0.07426735
can do to top it at that point in time So while the helicopter sequence,0.05207284
in the building jump are great action sequences that are very well shot It doesn't,0.08268739
feel like they top what came before feels like they were trying to do something,0.06532573
to top it But it doesn't quite work And you know by this point I'm,0.06614815
when you've had him on the outside of the plane and you've had him on,0.09347414
the tallest building there's not much you really can do because you can't exactly do,0.11730272
a top and critias space jump in Mission Impossible 7 So that's why I say,0.10416166
that the film feels like a victim of our expectations for it from there I,0.08258353
got one more negative and the third act feels like it was dragged out a,0.11111992
little bit too long there's a time element that plays into the mix and it,0.11035629
seemed like they were repeating some shots in some elements for the sake of Filling,0.15162997
up the amount of time that needed to pass but overall. This is a great,0.087830804
"exciting addition to this franchise overall, if I were to rate this one, I wouldn't",0.055490434
fit a Solid a this is what I wanted out of this movie It's delivering,0.13803215
what this genre is supposed to deliver and on an entertainment level. I would go,0.06421972
with a nine out of ten This is a great spy film It is a,0.14750743
great action film and it does a great job of tying this franchise together there's,0.06195189
not a lot of times where you get to the sixth element of franchise and,0.076268956
it's one of the best and that's Impressive with this franchise. That's kind of been,0.074936874
"firing on all cylinders for about ten Years now, so that's my take on the",0.4493037
movie. How about you did you love it? Did you hate it? Did it live,0.2476963
up to the hype or did it disappoint you a little bit? I would love,0.24095038
"to hear your take on this one. Also, I reviewed all the movies in this",0.06002385
franchise You can check that out right up here lite the fuse That's not good,0.089711525
