actually see in 2019 as part of this little segment on my channel we're gonna,0.081177264
finally discuss the one that a lot of people were very very positive about and,0.052244823
that is the Joseph mankiewicz film from 1950 also the Best Picture winner of 1950,0.035224296
All About Eve starring the greats Betty Davis and Baxter and Marilyn Monroe so I,0.047122166
really didn't know what this movie was about but it definitely was a movie that,0.05725461
I had always heard of anything by name and the fact that it also starred,0.069452815
the great Betty Davis but one of the few things that I always thought about,0.055350143
in regards to this film was the fact that Betty Davis was the character of,0.046881206
Eve and to my surprise she wasn't she was a character named Margo Channing and,0.12563568
Eve was played by Anne Baxter so that was definitely an interesting twist for me,0.05930091
also knowing that this was directed by Joseph mankiewicz and last year reviewing his film,0.12272258
Cleopatra I definitely was very curious as to how I was going to feel when,0.05368367
I watched this movie so this is the story of a young woman named Eve,0.13623844
this simple woman who is just head over heels over this Broadway actress named Margo,0.37813443
Channing and all she wants is to meet her and possibly be a part of,0.09128382
her life and after getting an opportunity thanks to the writer of a lot of,0.09993001
plays that Margo was a part of his wife Karen played by Celeste Holm Margo,0.13893284
really takes a liking to Eve and asks her to be one of her personal,0.109107405
assistants and as time moves on it turns out that this innocent hopeful woman with,0.239599
big dreams in her eyes was not the woman as she claimed to Margeaux already,0.52533656
had her suspicions about Eve pretty much from the get-go when after a few weeks,0.13561472
had passed and she realizes that while she may be idolizing her she may be,0.2564406
a little bit more towards obsession but it turns out that Eve has not only,0.117905155
powerful feelings towards Margo in terms of her star power she actually wants to use,0.08861048
this aging Broadway star to bring her own personal career to new heights and in,0.06460171
the world of theater one of the ways to do so is to step on,0.106471345
as many toes as you can and play people to actually make sure that you,0.17708746
get to where you want you literally have to act offstage as well as on,0.15928954
stage and through this process who of course gets involved well the journalists get involved,0.06347738
particularly a man named Addison DeWitt who is probably known for digging up the most,0.15538712
dirt on celebrities as he possibly can and what he discovers who this Eve is,0.36886263
and what she's all about he takes her under his personal wing and through that,0.24078159
Eve truly feels that she's gonna get even bigger and better and finally surpass Margo,0.14506331
as the new fresh face of Broadway until she realizes that even she with the,0.07600653
ambitions that she has can be played as well I will say with no expectations,0.1543446
about this film whatsoever this was one of the most interesting and powerful and overall,0.069285855
excitingly dramatic films that I have seen in a long while especially through the Golden,0.12428667
Age of Hollywood this movie with the accolades that it received at the Oscars as,0.05643312
well as being known as one of the greatest films of all time I see,0.102553666
it it is one of the most powerful and beautifully acted films that I have,0.0801277
ever seen I loved all of the acting in this film I was so entranced,0.117551014
by this story even with a movie over two hours long the hours just flew,0.06187135
by while I was watching it one of the other things that I really appreciate,0.05514593
about this film is especially when you take a look at today's world in film,0.096775234
how the leftist loonies are constantly yelling about the fact that women don't have powerful,0.68852013
representation in films did you not see All About Eve because the male characters in,0.10094014
this film are barely significant compared to the powerhouses that the female actors are in,0.21268287
this film we got an baxter and betty davis in their primes and they gave,0.27313653
us oscar-worthy performances for which they did in fact win the last home playing Karen,0.061602365
Richards also playing such an incredible performance as the writers wife as well as Marilyn,0.08201479
Monroe who has such a small role in this movie with her being on screen,0.28191915
every minute she just shines throws out great lines and even though she's only in,0.10285142
the film I think for a general amount of maybe five minutes she makes her,0.14132097
landmark in this movie as a whole is regards to one of her better performances,0.09564105
and I love that but without a doubt the dynamic characters the ever-changing layers of,0.06443383
each of them is just absolutely incredible I mean Betty Davis is one of the,0.070853546
legends her famous line fasten your seat belts it's going to be a bumpy night,0.3276816
speaks volumes in regards to what this movie is about and Baxter as Eve is,0.06301238
such an incredible character and it's not just the character evolving in the story but,0.014104458
it's the way that she looks at the camera looks at the characters the way,0.09157151
she looks like an innocent person in the beginning to an evil diva at the,0.47030377
end is just absolutely incredible I think that that was one of the most amazing,0.06670583
and worthy performances that I have ever seen from any actor it just gave me,0.07347268
goosebumps while I watched her change on screen and I just loved how at the,0.110919476
end of the day with this character being who she was the fact that what,0.11201542
happens to her and the end is something audience wanted to see happen because you,0.11128273
would think that Betty Davis was going to be the real crazed diva of the,0.3112429
film but it's incredible how she ended up being the victim at the end of,0.09361662
the day to a degree because of Eve's intentions I can't recommend this movie enough,0.11004602
even if you have never seen a black-and-white movie before even if you're not interested,0.24044588
in any movies that were made before 1980 I still cannot praise all about Eve,0.08913259
enough this is one of the best films that I have ever seen in my,0.14608032
life it is a movie that I would gladly see again and yes it's even,0.11137727
a movie that I would consider getting on DVD but I haven't reached that conclusion,0.08369156
just yet but it is definitely what everyone says it's supposed to be it is,0.04799555
such an incredible film for what it is for its time and it definitely pushed,0.06626989
so many boundaries in terms of roles for women I cannot praise all about Eve,0.18994968
enough which is why I will be giving it a very strong three and a,0.08158825
