"giving them nicknames based on the personality traits, and at one point he becomes convinced",0.096284
that the neighbor directly across from him has murdered his wife and he enlists the,0.22809029

even if your heart isn't pounding throughout the majority of the movie (because I gotta,0.055045277
"be honest mine wasn't), ""Rear Window"" is still a unique suspense mystery thriller that demands",0.034413274
your constant attention to everything that's happening on-screen and the reason that you pay attention,0.019231789
to everything that's happening on screen is that the three main characters are all so,0.0041048485
likeable and you want to see them be proven right! Jimmy Stewart is fantastic as,0.099352494
Jeff; he has this everyman personality where he's so soft-spoken and calm but still very,0.044440255
blunt and honest about how he feels towards people and he doesn't say very harsh,0.07741607
"things to anyone out of pure hatred or contempt, he does it because he feels",0.12349467
it's appropriate for the situation- especially when he's trying to convince everyone around him that,0.014328056
the neighbor across the street murdered his wife! I also really like how he's able,0.32468542
to (even in the most dire of circumstances) crack a joke to make fun of,0.09806004
"himself at his own expense and also take the edge off, take the stress levels",0.035622578
"down so that you can remain calm and collective and focus on the investigation, but",0.027454125
his arc in particular- the things that he learns over the course of the movie,0.017427811
"was probably the most fascinating thing about him! At the beginning, he's so detached from",0.028560326
"everyone around him-especially his girlfriend that as he's spying on his neighbours, he's spying on",0.17943795
them out of envy for supposedly having a much better life than he is and,0.13281256
"the more and more that he spends observing this one murder suspect, the more he",0.17181095
begins to see the other neighbors in order to pass the time in between and,0.025835067
he sees them experiencing possibly some of their worst moments in their lives and it,0.13940454
makes him acknowledge the fact that everyone around him is suffering in some capacity and,0.12275698
it makes him feel a lot more grateful for the people in his life to,0.037711922
"the point where he begins to get them more involved in the investigation, trust them",0.018204747
with the fact that they are willing to risk their own lives in order to,0.081326015
"help them prove that this guy did kill his wife! In a weird way, Alfred",0.6829548
Hitchcock actually uses voyeurism as a metaphor for the way that we make assumptions of,0.025907572
other people based on envy and mistrust and how often were proven wrong! Jimmy Stewart,0.08675658
in this movie especially has these assumptions that his girlfriend is too good for him,0.04578459
she has a much more upscale lifestyle and is much more into fashion compared to,0.031438574
"him who has more more of a simple, adventurous lifestyle-which she says to him over",0.080830455
and over again she's willing to try that out and also calls him out for,0.038824107
not being able to try a little bit of her own side of life! It,0.14844239
isn't until they both see the exact same clues that this murder suspect is leaving,0.05619272
behind that Lisa as a character has a lot more to prove and Grace Kelly,0.014003446
"absolutely rises to the occasion as this smart, honest, dignified woman who would hop a",0.25056806
fence in an expensive dress if it meant digging up clues and providing evidence to,0.018247318
the police! She's such a surprisingly well-written character for that era and I'm surprised based,0.24074876
on the success of this movie that there weren't that many female characters like her,0.037284873
in that time period! Thelma Ritter is also really good as the nurse-I was kind,0.033518605
"of hoping she would be in it a lot more, but she still brings some",0.026095819
levity to the subject matter by being this light but still snarky nurse who is,0.074266426
kind of Jimmy Stewart's confidant; she gives him advice throughout the majority of the movie,0.014679273
"but is never afraid to hold back-just like him, which is what makes them a",0.017837565
nice duo and it's nice to see her go from someone who instantly denies his,0.13886507
suspicions to become more-and-more focus on the clues and the tiny details as she's helping,0.04591031
him out on the stakeout! Now I haven't seen every single Alfred Hitchcock movie and,0.10634424
"the ones that I have, I could use some refreshing on, but it could possibly",0.028609548
be true when people say that this is him at his best! He always does,0.028245028
try as often as he can to put the put the audience and the characters,0.02254374
in a single location in order to raise the tension and make you feel trapped!,0.024653036
And the apartment complex that Jimmy Stewart lives in is the only location! The majority,0.016998768
of the camera angles in this movie only come from his apartment-it really does feel,0.036283772
"like you're in his mindset, like you're trapped alongside him being unable to control the",0.11103378
situation and I especially love the fact that as he's observing people with his own,0.04781606
"eyes and through his binoculars, that there's a certain level of scope based on the",0.037473787
geography of the location and how far away Jimmy Stewart is from the other neighbours;,0.025763893
"if the neighbours are close to him and he's spying on them with binoculars, they're",0.08548874
much bigger in scope and their dialogue and sound effects are a lot louder! But,0.036099516
"as soon as they're farther away- especially as he's spying on the murder suspect, the",0.06964207
"characters look like ants in comparison, you can hear absolutely nothing that they're saying and",0.026395151
it makes it a lot more mysterious! And one thing that I really appreciate about,0.022508483
the direction of the murder suspect is that for the first few shots of him,0.12949197
"and his wife, they're often in 'frames within a frame' where the suspect (played by",0.017627366
Raymond Burr) will be in this one living room that's portrayed through a window and,0.0733059
then in the other window you can see the wife who is bedridden and it,0.11393066
"shows the separation and the tension of that relationship and also provides some clues, possible",0.010102144
motives as to why he would want to kill his wife without any dialogue whatsoever!,0.66797787
There are so many great scenes where it's just Jimmy Stewart observing characters saying nothing,0.035808165
"but with the expressions and body language of being so still and motionless, just showing",0.020150408
how envious of the lifestyles that he thinks other people have and then only to,0.07525555
"be proven wrong over the course of the movie, which I think was also there",0.026075864
to kind of make it uncertain as to whether or not Jimmy Stewart was right,0.024217341
"or wrong about the murder suspect, but I gotta be honest, the biggest problem with",0.06427536
"""Rear Window"" is that the eventual outcome is incredibly predictable and a part of that",0.019015605
"does come from the fact that this movie has been remade, reconceptualized an paid homage",0.07122986
"to in so many other thrillers that it's not really this movie's fault in particular,",0.042746697
but it's something that you can't really ignore-especially if you're someone my age and you,0.08437655
"watch the movie ""Disturbia"" and you're just like ""This is such a cool concept"" and",0.10472119
"then older people in your life will just say ""No no no, that's from Alfred",0.07535267
"Hitchcock's 'Rear Window', that's completely different""! So I don't really blame Hitchcock or this movie",0.019559724
"in particular for being so predictable and kind of formulaic but at the same time,",0.018722923
it does take you out of the movie in certain scenes-especially towards the middle where,0.058314655
"characters do kind of express doubts over whether or not they're wrong, especially with Jimmy",0.012791482
Stewart and Grace Kelly and it also made the movie feel a little bit slower,0.042140048
in the middle once they begin to question themselves and their relationship and it felt,0.04015248
like there was 20 minutes of extra padding for no real reason... But that's really,0.022414694
"about it, ""Rear Window"" it probably is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies! It has",0.02035329
some of the best stylistic trademarks that he uses and one other one that I,0.027510665
want to point out is I love how there's a musician that's one of the,0.030527938
"neighbors and he's always playing his piano, so the musical score comes directly from that",0.019801186
musician character and it makes the overall score feel like a character of its own;,0.022243075
"when it's daylight it's full of music, full of energy but at nighttime there's nothing",0.027684279
but dead silence as Stewart and Kelly are observing this one murder suspect- who's also,0.28670925
played very well by Raymond Burr with almost no dialogue whatsoever! You never hear him,0.050192762
"for the first hour and a half, you only see him from the point of",0.021980993
view of the binoculars which makes him the size of an ant-which also makes him,0.068178
"seem a little defenseless because without spoiling anything, there are so many scenes where he",0.062373605
has absolutely no idea that he's under suspicion by anyone which also kind of makes,0.025564337
us wonder if that's really the case-if he knows if someone is watching him the,0.022231102
entire time or if he acknowledges that anyone's gonna ask some questions about where his,0.042173974
"wife's been this entire time, we have so many possibilities so many interpretations and that's",0.058435053
"the genius of this movie in regards to building it's suspense! ""Rear Window"" is so",0.050087664
"well directed, so well acted, so well written, so well scored that if you have",0.028732607
"Crave or any other streaming service with ""Rear Window"" on it, give it a watch!",0.04098662
"It'll totally be worth it! And for all those reasons, I'm gonna give ""Rear Window""",0.03648865
"4.5/5! Guys, thanks as always for watching! If you have seen ""Rear Window"", let me",0.01800386
know in the comments below what you thought of it! Let me know what's some,0.016491897
of your other favourite Alfred Hitchcock movies 'cause I've got plenty more classic movies to,0.04536752
"go along with over the course of... well, however long we're stuck here so whatever",0.029924616
"the case is, let me know in the comments below! Be sure to stay tuned",0.039990842
