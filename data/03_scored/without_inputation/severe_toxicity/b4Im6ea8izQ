though is they can't really walk out of this movie going well that wasn't entertaining,0.028322855
that was boring no this movie hits you with the entertainment factor the action sequences,0.06366872

in this movie played by an actress that I once again can't remember her name,0.03459354
really a lot of people in this movie kicked ass and I think that the,0.74456793
action sequences in general were filmed better CGI was better during these action cygnus movie,0.04460921
is definitely going for it in terms of the humor it takes everything that you,0.016957527
thought you knew about Thor from the previous movies and it tries to apply a,0.0061403103
more comedic touch to it for me that personally has some mixed results but overall,0.046542235
I can't deny there were definitely a few scenes in this movie where I was,0.023995835
laughing my ass off in particular some of the interactions between Loki and Thor I,0.39935604
mean those guys have always had great chemistry those guys have always been those great,0.040513676
Shakespearean brothers with a lot of great stuff between them both emotionally and from a,0.11598342
comedy standpoint so got some funny moments between Thor and Hulk in particular when Thor,0.023556149
and Hulk first run into each other there is some really funny that goes on,0.03527203
in that fight that you saw in the trailer I'm just gonna say that that,0.06685894
was probably the part of the movie that I laughed the hardest I also got,0.030583149

at all let me boss it rewind that I'm not saying Cate Blanchett sucks people,0.56505376
off to get younger I'm saying that somehow she has mastered the art of being,0.04151012
younger by possibly draining the life force from other people but I was so conflicted,0.095268935
walking out of this movie because listen I'm not a huge Thor fan but I,0.03427026
am a big fan of the Thor Ragnarok comic and usually when I'm comparing source,0.023577435
material to the media that is being portrayed in I try to separate it I,0.024669
try to go you know what artistic freedom they can take license they can change,0.036720797
some as long as it works for the movie and I'm kind of torn because,0.039893724
the thor ragnarok comic the one that i love the one that I read this,0.06755871
movie doesn't really feel like thor ragnarok and that's probably the biggest criticism that I,0.0158633
can have a movie called thor ragnarok is that it doesn't really feel like thor,0.018902523
ragnarok how the tension and the stakes aren't really there and when they are there,0.028674737
the movie in my opinion compromises the tension and the stakes and the elevated gravity,0.023644619
of the situation by throwing in another joke I mean I'm pretty sure this movie,0.04958944
can't go like two or three minutes without shoving another joke down your throat get,0.22257444
me wrong some of those jokes are funny and I laughed at some of them,0.05144131
but sometimes I feel like it was a clashing of tones I feel like part,0.025024874
of the movie is trying to be an apocalyptic end of days for Asgardians it's,0.06527048
supposed to be this big epic thing and the other part of the movie is,0.044367082
kind of this self-contained comedy that takes place on another planet and there's just a,0.08972196
whole bunch of jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes jokes being thrown at,0.14258477
you probably loosely about 50 jokes per minute I mean that's what it felt like,0.018159514
at times it felt like improv at the comedy theater because if there wasn't a,0.028964756
joke being thrown at you there was you know really cool 80s music playing while,0.07185314
of really epic action sequences knowing and so you feel like I don't know I,0.018808734
don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this has been called the most hilarious,0.0593264
Marvel movie ever for me I laughed a few times but I really don't think,0.06383768
the movie is as funny as other people made it out to be but again,0.040431194
humor is a subjective thing that could just be me then there are some other,0.008748495
instances in this movie of lazy storytelling where I feel like there are characters from,0.057541713
previous films who are either in this movie or not in this movie and their,0.03285475
absence or lack thereof is kind of unexplained in a way there are things that,0.018095655
happen in this movie that have very poor explanations there are things that happen in,0.046846222
this movie where you feel like it's glossed over and it's a very hasty storytelling,0.069708586
characters from previous movies there are characters from this movie and you feel like things,0.017383244
just kind of happen around their characters I can't really spoil and I didn't really,0.014796345
flesh out some of the arcs and some of the characters and some of the,0.033315722
story elements not just for previous movies but from this movie that could have used,0.011802353
a little bit more attention but instead they sacrificed that to tell another joke I,0.04856639
want to make it seem like I'm bitching about thor ragnarok I mean the movie,0.244239
again is entertaining and if that's all you wanted if that's all you're going into,0.026905349
this movie for mission accomplished the movie has entertained I feel like the flaws of,0.027327074
the movie in this case kind of way with the positives because for every moment,0.05263199
in this movie that I liked or I smile is another moment in this movie,0.033978246
that I rolled my eyes at or I hate it and so I can't really,0.15781549
in good conscience say that this movie is anything better than average much as it,0.032866724
pains me to say this store Ragnarok while entertaining is an average movie right in,0.12353059
the fortress of solitude I hope everybody else loves it I didn't personally love it,0.06391417
but I'm rooting for the movie to do it big at the box office so,0.015023173
