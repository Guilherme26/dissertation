think and let you guys see what the booby is before you guys see the,0.3939195
movie so I'm just going to read off my written review the movie Selma was,0.063305944
placed in rural Alabama during the 1960s during this time black people in the south,0.0168416
for fighting for their voting rights the legendary martin luther king jr. brilliantly played by,0.06655457
david on Lulu came to settlement with his members of Southern Christian Leadership Conference to,0.104595214
connect with the grassroot black activists already in summer to lead the nonviolent demonstrations throughout,0.2922782
the city during these demonstrations director Ava de Luna was able to depict the several,0.10108431
violent acts that were committed against the peaceful protesters by the city officials being you,0.40326223
know the officers on the governor letting them do these things crazy the violence against,0.34430066
the protesters recreated on film and connected the viewer to the struggles that the black,0.026752636
people of the 1960s went through fighting for their voting rights it also showed how,0.103270486
heartless the white people in the South once were screenwriter Paul web grabs the attention,0.5601575
of the viewers by creating a personal dialogue between dr. King president LBJ at the,0.08164467
time and his wife Coretta and also they show personal conversations with his group members,0.100982904
of the sels see these conversations allow the viewers to see a different side of,0.03559055
King allowing us to connect with King struggle and the movement do it all this,0.07038406
was a great movie ok that's the written review now this is my personal opinion,0.07794176
about the movie now Selma was a recreated event this happened you know in the,0.055537507
ninth in around March bloody sunday was a March March something 1965 let's say in,0.51760954
1965 right now we're in 2015 this is almost 50 years ago that this event,0.0443266
happened now um being a heartful film and being um actually produced by oprah his,0.09982682
production company and i was thinking the other day like Harpo is crazy cousin color,0.4546338
purple I think hella purple every time I think Harpo or I think of Oprah,0.1561074
so harpal was I think Danny Glover played by danny glover and he was raping,0.72727287
you know whoopee and stuff and I mean that's what I think besides that um,0.14584914
the the creating budget for this film was 20 million dollars 20 million dollars so,0.047075752
they so my personal opinion we use 20 million dollars which you know I see,0.07233413
everything as a big community because I feel like that's what um that is what,0.0646045
our people need we need to stick together you know and the thing to spend,0.24086887
them really wrecking our communities is the whole divide and conquer mentality so we're out,0.27299297
here separately it's not going to work so let's say 20 million dollars coming out,0.068383746
of our community to create a Selma now a lot of us you know that,0.06306795
um has some time on this earth has heard about about the civil rights movement,0.12847544
you know and it's felt the struggle of the civil rights movement that is still,0.107759826
a real struggle today you know some people that are in Alabama some people that,0.05842864
are still in the rural South are still dealing with that same oppression because as,0.07624027
we as we understand you know the United States history um these people came from,0.08940432
Europe they came from Britain they came from Germany it can from italy they came,0.14990522
here and oppressed the original native american that lived on this land push them into,0.17949925
reservations massacre there there of their elders and their children this is what happened so,0.1681688
that story has been told you know even though you know it's been told from,0.039255053
there his story you know their personal accounts of what happened and um basically it,0.054342836
was bloodshed you know and and that has been their history and their story ever,0.2716741
since even leading up to this 1960s selma events called Bloody Sunday so the fact,0.17741688
that we still put ourselves in situations like that um just regarding to the 1960s,0.056056
because as I watched the video you know even though you know um the devonian,0.19010806
I think I'm murdering her name I don't want to murder her name but you,0.69542736
know she was able to you know create scenes during in the movie that was,0.08761993
that was very um heart heart wrenching you know it was tearjerkers cuz she she,0.17665954
began the movie with the with the birmingham girls in the church being just blown,0.5953616
up boo automatically took even though I wasn't even alive then you know I didn't,0.16996896
even know about how about that i was even thought of but once i seen,0.08111715
these girls get blown up on film it automatically took me there you know our,0.4164045
man took me to to the place of of the harsh races prejudice South you,0.47982466
know and but I mean it's not really surprising to me you know once I,0.104106195
because I understand history this is the Europeans history you know everywhere they went it,0.10604495
was terrorism it was it was bloodshed it was killing this is this is their,0.4171372
history so I'm saying with with visa with these certain scenes that ava devine he,0.06862537
was able to create Jesus brought me back I'm 20-24 so she just brought me,0.12873828
back to that oppression you know she brought me back to you know filling um,0.34733254
um empathy and sympathetic and just low and why me for these girls I mean,0.31089434
even though these girls has went on to you know the Act life you know,0.24671721
that the UM the forever the infinity you know they they are our essence is,0.05137232
now because if they would have live did not have been bombed by you know,0.24222116
other Christians it's ready cuz you got to understand um these people are people black,0.5876557
people in America you know black is the label they put on us but I'm,0.4032203
gonna go on you know for the sake of this review black people you know,0.53490317
um that were put down in the church at that time was bombed by white,0.62895256
Christians so there was black Christians in the church and there was white Christians outside,0.47199696
of the church bombing the church building killing our little girls that's just fact that,0.6463645
that's just this is what it was so you know it was it was cruel,0.16308081
seeing it on the scene I mean seeing it on the screen but the scene,0.1507355
was real it's what happened it was faction um other things you know the March,0.05138577
dub the bloody sunday March seeing our people walk from Selma you know going to,0.5876557
Montgomery after you know a heated um conversation with Martin Luther King and the recent,0.0797597
president LBJ at that time um on the King big basically babe he said it,0.22339204
within you know in an educated standpoint you know as depicted by Amy does devonian,0.102836005
written by Paul web though this is all text written by Paul web you have,0.093450315
to remember that Paul weapons your peanuts once you like to know that Google that,0.24143256
so so we still have the European telling this story so you know he spoke,0.059883714
to LBJ telling about the importance of us having voting rights all around the south,0.08246899
because that was something we were deprived up we would deprive the Voting Rights so,0.089079395
after that LBJ denied him said I got other things to do I got other,0.099391475
things to do so they continued on the March so they can bring awareness and,0.08243277
show what's going on to show that we need boating rights now so you know,0.14976372
um passing a little talented the towns called Lions they didn't lock the black American,0.47429076
the black citizens to pass through there they're counting these are real Christian folks to,0.43211895
these are Christian folks then other Christian folks want you guys to understand that make,0.26103842
sure that's clear so they didn't want the black people passing through their city you,0.6324041
know they call them you know they want them passing through the city so you,0.113987766
know what they did they barricaded the side of the city they barricaded the bridge,0.115087226
and they got ready for war you know being mean the white people I speak,0.59149605
about of lions i think it was Lions County they think they was on horseback,0.10057549
policeman on horseback they had policeman with bats batons they had um one guy that,0.24203014
they showed as he rolling up one of his bats with barbed wire I mean,0.49088585
ready to commit violence and this crowd of black people were just marching peacefully marching,0.8606264
peasley to Montgomery just to get voting rights I mean these rights are written in,0.11736621
the Constitution they are mean if you understand the Constitution and read the bill of,0.06188766
rights I mean we're giving inalienable rights means meaning you cannot lean on the natural,0.11924673
rights of the man you cannot lean on our rights we have rights that are,0.12572207
written and rights that are not read I mean they're given to us by our,0.13512924
Creator so these rights are infinite so boating is definitely one of those so these,0.072856255
people get beat I mean Bloody Bloody on the scene so it automatic scene is,0.53490317
another scene that brought me back to that oppression I seen my grandmother my auntie,0.24036667

to be brutalized waiting to be harassed that is what we wait for we want,0.25253785
the world to see us get beat why why why do we want to be,0.18753906
in such a docile state do we not understand that that in the days of,0.123488106
Kemet in the days of newbie in the days of the great cushion push em,0.15843156
pyres in Ethiopia we were kings and warriors we were kings and warriors I was,0.18052357
watching a Native American doctor documented me the other day it was on on him,0.11653708
the aim Association when they were fighting for their rights and the Native Americans are,0.15601212
fighting for their rights at a very similar time when you know the black America's,0.5553734
fighting for their rights and when they was fighting for their rights they they got,0.11311512
in touch with their spiritual self they got in touch with their ancestors they got,0.25768113
in touch with the ancient rituals their people used to do back in the day,0.18178736
when I seen you know Selma I'm good where we're focused on Selma now every,0.063813694
time we had a conference every time we came together to talk about the events,0.048646953
that were going on where we yet we're in the church who built the church,0.08416376
the southern white man who taught you about Jesus Christ who taught you about the,0.36153704
King James version of the Bible who taught you that it was the slave master,0.2604811
it's written is written the slave masters talk to you about King James the slave,0.3740778
masters talk to you about Christian be and where do we come together at when,0.20679705
we want to talk about I guess I even joining the slave masters because right,0.32753155
then we're pushing integration we wanted to go into their systems we wanted to vote,0.053352844
for our own senators and governors but we have to realize that governmental system of,0.046494637
democracy is their sister it is the slave master system so let's wait you're talking,0.31089434
about fighting for boating what really confused me and had me perplexed over the the,0.18041852
movie is out of everything we can fight for out of everything to fight for,0.108482935
it with with promises the 40 acres of them and the meal I was even,0.05201634

watch it counts as as you know Selma Bloody Sunday we see the history of,0.2407862
them not morning us here but yet we want to fight and integrate into their,0.16784768
system the great Malcolm met the great teacher Malcolm X he spoke about this a,0.06567796
lot why what why try to fight and n be brutalized because of us wanting,0.21289393
to sit at their counters and eat or us wanting to go to the schools,0.14572418
with their kids so they could teach us about Columbus Columbus founding you know America,0.10066692
which we know is wrong when she know was not a relevant statement in the,0.087418646
perspective of us being melon 80 people that have been on this this here land,0.08352437
that they call America's since the beginning of time look up the Native Americans I,0.15223911
want you guys to look up the Morse nation you know there were tribes here,0.1147739
that were originally here way before the European came here that looked just like you,0.10197202

kings and queens the originator of the earth just look at the information because there's,0.10581628
information out here so as a community we could go past slavery I feel like,0.13303682
us making movies as in Selma we're just reminding ourselves with oppression a small period,0.1572654
of our life we've been around since the beginning of time let's tell that story,0.051925983
we go past the caveman let's go past that story don't even don't even think,0.33787167
paleo think the great Asiatics think the great um I could bulan this think the,0.1496303

those people there's a lot of stories out here so you know us telling the,0.054357987
story of selma and i want to say rest in peace all of the ancestors,0.092989415
that sacrifice their life for settlement because that's what they seem fit at that time,0.31089434
so i don't say anything is wrong i'm not saying anything is wrong with those,0.060966384
actions that those people at that time took but this is our time now we,0.13750118
have to walk through the doors that they open we have to live the dream,0.07095619
of Martin Luther King reactor we have to actually put into action these things that,0.0710658
our great ancestor sacrifice forward and create our own create our own stories instead of,0.06385574
