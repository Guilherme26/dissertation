I was very impressed with what Bradley Cooper was able to put together,0.057044182

if you ever watched his interview on Inside the Actors Studio,0.09876197
you might cry because he's sitting there being interviewed by James Lipton and he can't keep it together because it's just so emotional for him that he's and at this point in his career which I love and here he has shown that he has considerable talent at constructing a film and Lady Gaga who I think is insanely talented and one of the best musical voices of our current times is incredible in the film she obviously has a role here,0.083660826
that's tailor-made for her,0.100022845
it's not like the character herself is like Lady gaga,0.45791602
but it's obviously one that she could play very well kind of like mm an eight-mile,0.13295601
she's never gonna get a role this perfect for her but that being said she really did knock it out of the park her voice is just astoundingly great the music is so good,0.24263084
some of the best songs I've heard in a film written for a film in a long time,0.111232586
and Bradley Cooper I think gives the best performance I've ever seen from him really touching stuff really powerful movie that being said my favorite actor in the film and I think the best performance in the film is actually from Sam Elliot who I feel like is a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor I've seen him in things for years I mean he's incredible although I packed a Roadhouse for God's sakes which is just a guilty pleasure,0.06978663
but um here,0.05915243
he plays the brother of Bradley Cooper's character who helps him out on his tours gets gigs for him,0.0820066
and he's having a very hard time watching his brother circle the drain and it's some of the best acting,0.18157981
I think I've seen this year,0.05247461
there's one scene in a,0.051025886
car no dialogue,0.10083002
he's just he puts the car in reverse,0.13243501
and he turns around it's just that shot right,0.4033319
there is a shoo-in for like all the Best Supporting Actor Awards this year and if he doesn't even get nominated I would actually be upset the chemistry to between Gaga and Cooper is off the charts,0.10263862
I mean these people feel like,0.08158155
they're in love this doesn't feel like acting,0.0983962
it feels like one of those films where the cameras captured real events and that's like the highest level of praise for acting in regards to issues,0.08788384
there are some major majorly important character moments that do feel rushed,0.06194935
there's one scene in particular involving a ring at a dinner table,0.041623253
and it was just like what what there's other moments where sometimes time has passed but you don't really realize it,0.06547135
and then you realize the time has passed but it didn't really feel like it past,0.04915309
you know the narrative isn't always perfectly flowing there's little character beats like that that could be a little more fleshed out and some more emotion given to them,0.055247568
but the way you watch an artist taken by the industry and turned into something that she isn't and a man another artist who's been in the industry for a long time who feels like he's running out of juice,0.15497003
it's such a great commentary on what the industry the music industry can also do to an artist transform them into like a product like a package for everyone to just consume rather than someone who has something to say,0.10495855
and it's actually a really beautiful message,0.06334784
so some of the best music I've heard in a movie for a long time some of the best performances of the year Sam Elliott man he knocked it out of the park Cooper is going to be a great director if he can continue this type of filmmaking and this type of momentum and Lady Gaga does have a serious future as an actress,0.10927616
