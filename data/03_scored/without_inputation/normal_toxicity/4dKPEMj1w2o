this is really his stamp his style of directing that you feel within the favorite really the great performances in here are all just wonderful one of the reasons being Olivia Colman steals the show a lot of the time due to the fact that just a strong script that she got in the way that she was able to chew the dialogue out and just spit it out on to the screen and just portray it perfectly but really rachel weisz and emma stone are really both competitive for Best Supporting Actress this year so both superb everyone really in here does such a great job in here doing the character that they're supposed to play and really transforming into these characters this is one of the first roles where I didn't just see Emma Stone I saw the character that she was playing same goes to Rachel Weisz and Olivia as course you just see their characters you don't you forget that they're actors,0.15426818
