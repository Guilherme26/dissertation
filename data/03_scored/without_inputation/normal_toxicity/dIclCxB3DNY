it was a great movie that's all you need to know welcome back,0.07972921
today we're talking about a star is born at my school,0.059029445
there was a pretty screening for the movie so as you know the movies coming out on October 5th,0.03395167
so we're gonna talk about the movie plot a review of the movie and there's gonna be a lot of spoilers,0.07590842
I'm not a movie critic so I'm not gonna use official terms like the rising action and stuff so I'm just gonna talk out of my ass basically,0.86069924
so the very beginning of the movie started out with Bradley Cooper who plays my god what was his name Jackson me,0.06906657
so Bradley Cooper plays Jackson main who is a country singer as and that's like we see within,0.06446533
the first few minutes,0.121058345
he is obviously an alcoholic,0.69542736
and he is constantly taking pills before and after his show and then after his show he wants to go drink some more he's out of liquor,0.16272293
so he ends up going to I thought it was pretty obvious that he was an alcoholic to begin with but so basically afterwards he goes to a bar and it's a drag night at the bar and there's lady gaga and she was performing La Vie en Rose which is a good song,0.28017578
and basically she falls in love with her boys FY Lady Gaga's not playing a drag queen that she just happened to be like performing there that night also anyway so he falls in love with her,0.3530422
and then he was like dude that was resin this start they have chemistry and then like you can see like oh my gosh it's gonna be an epic love story,0.101815335
so then afterwards they go to a bar where they Lady gaga her character's name is Ali punches,0.40310928
this guy who was being basically a dick to Bradley Cooper's character and I'm like it's all cute like he gives her peas for her knuckles,0.8606264
and then there sitting on a curb he's drunk she's singing to him and then he like falls in love with her like right then and then basically stalks there for a little bit but not like in a weird way like some other movies romanticized stalking then he's like oh like,0.35882735
please come to my show and then she's like okay,0.2002031
and then she goes to the show then he's like by the way that song that you sing the other night you're performing it right here with me so yeah and then like that started this whole thing where they went on tour together and Ally became huge but like right like in the middle of the movie there's just like this dark tone where you're like okay,0.13180226
something's about it like get up,0.061361603
so you can see that his drinking problem is getting progressively worse as they are following more in love with each other,0.15842032
it's just like he was like oh like he's a drunk with that like they add character to like to that you know usually a movie though just have like a drunk be a drunk basically,0.4052547
the humanized him using human,0.44700557
we're like a lot of movies when they portray drunks they don't portray the human aspect of them,0.44806704
so you can see how in love,0.08427493
he is with her but he also is struggling with this alcoholism,0.095125616
but it's not being addressed by the right people,0.15276076
and then they end up getting engaged in the end of getting married and then Ali starts like launching her own career and then at the same time accents career is like starting to fizzle out and then at one point he even gets replaced by somebody else and then Ali has like become a huge success,0.07790272
but also like her manager is kind of a dick and wants to change her and then you see like her style changed from was it down-to-earth country until I pop and I'm like she's even like oh we need to dye your hair and I don't know it was weird,0.8315943
so she changes a little but then like throughout all of this she gets really successful,0.076151535
even wins like she's nominated for three Grammys wins a Grammy,0.11640761
and this is basically when the whole thing went to and you're like this is what all the like weirdness throughout the movie has been hinting towards was already at the Grammys,0.08257237
and he had been replaced by somebody so he had to be like a guitarist like the person's guitarist,0.15144983
even though like he was bigger than the other person it just like kind of hurt his ego,0.23879811
so he's got really drunk then he went to go sit down with Ali,0.34174553
it was announced that she won the Grammy but she goes up to get her award,0.06775338
and he like starts going with her but then he stumbles down falls on the stairs like Jennifer Lawrence and like what was that like 2014 Grammys or something he eventually stumbles up with her and she's like giving her acceptance speech,0.10292291
and he's standing next to her and he is so drunk,0.5803108
and then he pissed himself onstage at the Grammys and collapsed and it was this whole dramatic thing they carried him out and he got sent to rehab,0.3858016
but the whole time he's in rehab like Ali's still doing her shows but she misses him a lot like the the thing about the movie is that they love each other so deeply which is also part of like why the movies like it's great,0.09817485
it's not just a tragic story about somebody falling in love and then like somebody having alcoholism and then like both of their lives getting destroyed which is like does happen,0.14974311
but it's so it's so great like,0.058116514
it's a great love story,0.04998609
so he got sent to rehab everything seems great,0.16353498
he's obviously like a little depressed about everything,0.41817948
and he feels so bad but it seems like he's on the right track to making things happen and it goes home,0.16370735
and now we're going to talk about Ali's manager which I said earlier was kind of a dick Ali's not the air the manager talks to Jackson and it's basically like you're a and you're gonna ruin Ali's career if you stay with her and then so what happens next was just like oh my god it was so bad cuz,0.7703108
he finally seemed like everything was getting back together,0.12622577
then like Ali's got a concert and she was like this is the last concert and then I'm gonna be home with you all summer because she had actually had a whole tour in Europe then but she decided to cancel it so she could stay with him,0.08220299
because her manager wouldn't agree to let him go with her on the Europe tour and then so at her last concert he is this huge dramatic scene he distracts his dog so that his dog won't like I don't know do something,0.4033302
and then he goes and he kills himself in the garage like he hangs himself with a belt,0.77035964
oh it was a saddest scene ever like everybody in like my school's Little Theater was like,0.19010742
and then like you could audibly hear people like starting to cry and then it's just so sad because afterwards it shows Ali and like the effect it had on her and you can see how much she really loved him the way,0.17244072
the movie ended was her singing,0.14381886
a love song that he had written for her,0.10434837
and that's just basically a short summary of the movie but it doesn't really do,0.054926593
the movie dresses in any way so in conclusion Robbie Cooper is an amazing actor and director if you didn't know he did direct this movie it was an amazing movie just the whole time you feel all the raw emotions and it just seemed,0.089290045
so it was great,0.08120879
I don't know what's a word,0.07973521
and I I know Lady Gaga has been like in TV shows before,0.17131421
I don't think she's ever been in a movie before I could be wrong but she did she did it a really good job at portraying somebody with such raw emotion and just somebody who was so new and innocent to an industry and Bradley Cooper is really good at portraying a damaged person,0.1617647
he's really good at playing the damaged person and that's kind of scary because you're like how can you be like that,0.31089434
but this story is the type of movie where everybody can feel a connection at some point or another,0.04992139
it's not just one of those movies that you go in for entertainment,0.14593002
it's something that you go in to feel like to completely submerge yourself into a plot and really like become attached to characters which is what makes the ending so tragic,0.11701368
it's a work of art,0.089073434
I highly recommend this movie it's premiering on Thursday,0.0956968
that is my review I got these awesome posters for free,0.06219455
it's really a great movie you should go out and see it like this video,0.35824907
