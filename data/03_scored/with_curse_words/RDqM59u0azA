there's nothing that says i love you more than giving your boyfriend an old-fashioned on,0.45774466
the beach it's true love in its purest form moonlight released in 2016 and is,0.104358
directed by barry jenkins who has also directed such films like medicine for melancholy and,0.15444922
if beale street could talk and this film is starring travante rhodes andre holland janelle,0.15459056
monae ashton sanders jerrell jerome naomi harris and mahershala ali moonlight follows a young african-american,0.2494876
man who grapples with his identity and sexuality while experiencing the everyday struggles of childhood,0.47557485
adolescence and the begrudging adulthood and this film is the recipient of three academy awards,0.0854991
including best picture officially best supporting actor and best adapted screenplay which i'm gonna be,0.05878327
honest i gotta call nlgger on that adapted screenplay thing because this is based on,0.26970935
a play that was never published i i believe it the work has to be,0.080159195
published in order for it to be adapted and fall under that category so if,0.05896893
anything this should have won best original screenplay in my opinion and then films like,0.08324408
arrival or fences should have won for best adaptive screenplay that year just my opinion,0.020156745
this is also the movie that was part of the big like once in a,0.09019208
lifetime controversy at the oscars where the best picture winner was announced as la la,0.032976337
land and then for like two minutes it was the best picture until it wasn't,0.056420755
and they realized like oh no it's actually moonlight we had the wrong card we,0.06748458
read off the wrong card i remember when it happened too and when all of,0.0586909
it happened and they said la la land i was super happy because that was,0.056896888
my pick for best picture that year but there was i remember having this gut,0.08782327
feeling like something was gonna happen or something something like this was gonna happen and,0.10689007
then all of a sudden here it was did they ever announce who was fired,0.11037315
over that i mean that's that's something that's like okay someone's gonna be fired over,0.25253084
this it's nothing against you as a person but this was a humongous mistake someone,0.51855487
needs to lose their job over this oh whatever though i'm not going to look,0.19309558
it up instead i'm going to talk about this movie which is a beautiful look,0.08471306
at a very difficult time in a very difficult subject for a lot of people,0.068146996
especially of a younger age now i have my own baggage i am a straight,0.15174827
white male so that's the experience that's the privilege that i have so looking at,0.33210975
this film that just examines the black experience and especially someone of the black experience,0.23491323
coming up confused about their sexual identity i can only pull so much from my,0.49198368
own baggage so take that for whatever you will hey it's a white boy talking,0.49165672
about moonlight you can find it credible if you want or you can pass over,0.066610835
this review it's definitely your prerogative but i'm just laying it out there for you,0.14836279
i remember watching this the first time and i was kind of lukewarm on it,0.12710866
there were things about the film that i absolutely loved and i thought were perfect,0.038748223
they were beautiful they were heart-wrenching and there were some aspects of the film where,0.03742614
i was like this what the storytelling device just doesn't really make sense here and,0.072743714
watching it a second time for this review i still feel the same way the,0.062060412
story structure or the storytelling device that this film implements is this is three different,0.06327866
separate chapters in chiron's life the first chapter deals when he was very very young,0.101074494
as a kid chapter two deals with when he was a teenager and chapter three,0.15908867
deals with when he is an adult which sounds good on paper i think but,0.2330157
in execution it just felt like you hit a wall between each chapter in particular,0.39782262
the first two chapters this is when shiron is figuring out himself and figuring out,0.0910355
where he wants to go with his life and then when the screen pops up,0.106531195
he's aged 10 years and i go no no no i was i was liking,0.12373567
what was happening with the kid i was liking what was happening with mahershala ali,0.096344255
i want to see that connection more so in terms of satisfying the audience in,0.075230055
the term of storytelling the plot structure here it doesn't make sense why would you,0.06093647
do this it's terrible there's a part of me for like the first like five,0.15068243
or ten minutes of the next chapter that's just so angered inside because i was,0.09825565
being i was being groomed for what was happening in the one part of his,0.11789713
life and i wanted to see it and then nope it happened and now we're,0.06643051
over here in this chapter of his life it almost felt a little pretentious like,0.31089434
oh yes this is my storytelling device it's so unique to this film come on,0.15161347
that's that's not cool but i have a sense that i'm definitely in the minority,0.10365256
with that viewpoint on this film because this film is paled by many people by,0.11246207
many publications as one of the best films in the last decade do i agree,0.050518986
with that sentiment no it's good it's just not one of the best that i've,0.08585532
seen sorry well let me talk about the things that i love about this film,0.09562256
jerrell jerome who plays the adolescent version of chiron is magnificent oh my god i,0.09386042
felt it felt so hard for this kid this poor adolescent teenager who is hiding,0.36490613
just this what to himself feels like this dark secret inside he doesn't want to,0.26745343
let that out because if he lets that out he's going to be bullied and,0.24374652
beaten to an inch of his life and just the obvious depression and sadness just,0.41577664
with his facial reactions alone he doesn't have that many lines and it makes sense,0.16443318
because he's a quiet teenager he is struggling with his sexuality and how that has,0.4575226
implications on the culture that he is in there have been articles and there have,0.100489676
been interviews of the directors saying that the the black culture the black adolescent culture,0.34701246
when you are a man you're supposed to promote masculinity and to do that you,0.31089434
need to promote toughness and you need to show up your muscles and show aggression,0.39691594
that makes you manly that makes you tough and to some degree that's kind of,0.108446345
how my adolescence was too if you had any feminine or homosexual tendencies as a,0.55512065
young boy as a teenager you were made fun of and picked on it definitely,0.1515263
happened to me a few times growing up and it happened to a couple other,0.06422714
people in my school growing up as well needs to say i connected with this,0.1612762
character so much and i felt so bad for him he barely has any lines,0.26119846
he just he tells the emotion he tells the story with his physicality and with,0.09106152
his facial expressions this actor is exceptional i want to see him go on to,0.5154597
do many other things he he was great here and heck even when we get,0.18363789
to young chiron this little kid has the same tendencies he's seen as an outcast,0.31089434
and he's constantly bullied on by kids at school and i'll be honest the first,0.51664114
time that i watch this movie i didn't watch any trailers i didn't read anything,0.106360644
about it i just watched it and it took me a while to realize like,0.07285981
oh no this is about a kid who's discovering their sexuality for the very first,0.41679358
time and asking themselves questions am i gay am i straight what what do i,0.5444034
find attractive how would i know what i find attractive and that's where mahershala ali's,0.08235328
character comes in one hershali of course won the best supporting actor in this role,0.052331626
and he absolutely deserved it but it's annoying because he's barely in this movie he's,0.42964122
only in the first chapter you have such a great supporting character i wanted to,0.0762337
see where that relationship was going and then we go to chapter two and he,0.11362635
is oh again that's the storytelling here and i hate it because it leaves the,0.22060813
characters to tell us about things that happen or maybe ambiguously tell us things that,0.040542733
may have happened to certain characters that we don't see again anymore i hate it,0.3032851
i hate the storytelling here i can't get over it i love the child actor,0.48522788
mahershan ali is fantastic in his role as one janelle monae who plays his wife,0.1272512
is a stellar actor i've loved everything that i've seen her in and she's such,0.14865504
a kind-hearted warm spirited character that i i want to reach through the screen and,0.15863329
give her a hug and say thank you for helping this kid out because this,0.13691378
kid is being bullied he is such a what seems to be a terrible life,0.49705583
thank you for helping him and then we get to naomi harris's character who plays,0.037021626
chiron's mother and she plays a character that you just love to hate i hate,0.53112906
this mother so much she's one of the worst mothers in all of cinema putting,0.79114395
my foot down on that and kudos goes to naomi harris she is a brilliant,0.26596504
actress and she does an amazing job here what she does and the way she,0.12261364
portrays this drug addict of a mother who doesn't give two shits about her kid,0.91420525
just is looking for that next score to make herself feel good the way she,0.07792601
portrays her is so brilliantly done it was such a tight race with her and,0.15576117
viola davis for best supporting actress that year at the academy awards i would have,0.3970945
given it to viola davis too but god damn it naomi harris is a close,0.85628736
second it's a character that you just love to hate there's nothing redeeming about her,0.36037245
at all and she tries to make her son and sequentially the audience feel bad,0.13679254
for her in the final chapter when you see that she's in rehab and she's,0.17004529
trying to make herself better and have a better life you just see what she,0.26834175
did to shyron in the first two chapters that you go no you don't deserve,0.17938937
forgiveness you were a terrible mother no mother should ever do that to a child,0.7448482
i just hated her so much she was that damn good so good where i,0.7680624
think this film falls short other than the storytelling device is our final two lead,0.10262558
actors in the final chapter of chiron's life andre holland and trevontae rhodes they play,0.09915894
the adult versions of the adolescent versions of their characters and when they were teenagers,0.08828342
they did have a kind of hidden sexual relationship and here they are as adults,0.57269084
and they're trying to rekindle that spark because they hadn't seen each other in almost,0.067434415
10 years and personally i felt no sexual or romantic tension between the two in,0.45232204
particular on chiron's part this this kid your former friend from high school he's the,0.23408468
only one that's ever touched you or lit that flame in you in a sexual,0.69542736
or desired manner and here you are as an adult you are on your own,0.256753
fruition and you're seeing him for the very first time i do not feel any,0.15250885
type of sexual or romantic tension between you and kevin i just don't as an,0.6364068
audience member it's absent for me needless to say i think this film is it's,0.17975351
a good two-thirds of a film but then when we get to that final chapter,0.07597244
just kind of halts and all the energy at least that was supposed to be,0.05873272
happening throughout the entire movie i think we just come to an abrupt wall we,0.1419072
never keep going after that the cinematography here is beautiful the use of colors the,0.08739927
use of water throughout chiron's entire life is exceptional i love the little details and,0.061617978
the layers upon layers that everything that you see in each shot is telling you,0.28522626
as an audience member but again the final chapter and the way that the story,0.052126486
is told it just why would you ever do that as a storyteller you stop,0.14927448
the energy you stop the pacing abruptly and it takes a while to get that,0.08641057
going again and then when you get it going again all of a sudden we're,0.047698095
stopping and we're fast forwarding another 10 years in this kid's life i don't want,0.27939978
to do that i want to see the transition i want to see the progression,0.092438884
of this character as opposed to being told hey here he is and hey here,0.13990934
he is again here he is again as an adult there you go give me,0.19447559
the oscar again there are great things about this film but there are also things,0.06585968
that i i hate about this movie and i know i'm in the minority with,0.43215021
that but this is my personal opinion this is my channel this is my review,0.08858062

dvd movie for bruce willis which is what he's been loving to do in the,0.15063702
