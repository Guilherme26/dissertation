well greetings and salutations everybody welcome to my movie vlog my name is John Campea,0.073428296
and this is my review for the brand-new Guillermo del Toro movie the shape of,0.03417514
water I'm not quite sure what the shape of water is but it's a damn,0.26546893
good movie I'll tell you that there I just spoiled the lead for it I,0.045255106
love this film I really enjoy this movie we're gonna talk about a little bit,0.08457411
here now I'm actually doing this little video live because what I found is quite,0.061665185
often when I do movie review sometimes people will then ask questions of things I,0.06245742
didn't cover in the review so I thought you know what why not do this,0.012530064
live and let you guys ask me questions that you have about the movie once,0.04625022
I give my a little bit of a review for it so we're gonna do,0.06669796
that in just a second but right now let's get into the movie the shape,0.06081907
of water follows the character played by Sally Hawkins whose name is Eliza in the,0.007543848
film now it's kind of really funny and odd for me because this is the,0.027786717
same woman who played the mom in Paddington such a wholesome great little fun movie,0.18444146
and fun character and let me tell you something folks the shape of water is,0.0121030165
not a family film no way no how it is not a family film and,0.024621774
I remember when I was watching one preview for it it said the following movie,0.019642873
contains graphic sexuality and nudity I'm winning and like wait wait wait what this movie's,0.3875798
gonna have that I mean surely it's just gonna be rated R because it's gonna,0.04835087
have some like really creepy graphic stuff it is Guillermo del Toro right and it's,0.07383605
gonna have some violence or whatever but I didn't think that and yep it does,0.07072765
just be prepared when you go in to watch the shape of water there's some,0.018163504
there's nudity and some graphic sexuality and things like that in there too which I,0.37155715
thought just added to the film to be honest with you but just give you,0.01896239
a heads up again though it was kind of jarring for me at first thinking,0.11359674
but this is the mom from Paddington come on but no really she is absolutely,0.051484548
magnificent anyway Eliza plays a mute woman she's not deaf but so she's mute so,0.29286152
she communicates in sign language and she works as an in janitorial service at this,0.041108347
government facility and at night she goes in and cleans up now as you saw,0.05472599
in the trailers what happens is this one government starts to hold or this government,0.010205912
agency starts to hold this sure that they found in their facility and of course,0.017473044
the creature No contrary to popular belief even though it is played by Doug Jones,0.028346801
it is not AIDS sapien so who is also played by Doug Jones in another,0.038583312
gamble del Toro film but this facility starts to house this creature that they have,0.08492998
come across and discovered and of course Sally Hawkins as you can see in the,0.024191398
trailer starts to befriend the creature now also starring in the film playing our bad,0.039303705
guy is General Zod himself Michael Shannon who is spectacular in this film along with,0.09539066
them of course we also have Octavia Spencer who plays Eliza's best friend at work,0.019867705
she's fantastic and the absolutely unbelievable Richard Jennings who is in this film plays her,0.154592
kind of her best friend and the only person in the world she's really really,0.03809507
close to they live in adjoining apartments and he's kind of her confidante and she,0.15987688
to him and I'm telling you right now if I had to vote today I,0.022374783
would vote for Richard Jennings to get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor,0.03818886
for this movie he was wonderful in it Sally Hawkins is gonna end up getting,0.13313119
a Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards she just is and she absolutely should,0.010313672
if she doesn't it's a bit of a snub if she doesn't get a Kadim,0.14077148
II award nomination for Best Actress in this absolutely now you would think by watching,0.017885458
the trailers as well and I'm not gonna give any spoilers in this thing here,0.037160486
you would think by watching the trailers that this movie is exclusively about you know,0.030125502
it's kind of a monster movie it's a little bit of a Pan's Labyrinth thing,0.17935812
where now she's gonna break out the monster blah blah but really the beautiful thing,0.22083764
about this movie is that there is so much more to it there is so,0.028320858
much heart and so much meaning in everything Guillermo del Toro does in this film,0.055209577
that to me really at its heart when you're looking at the characters played by,0.010458018
both Sally and Richard and even Octavia and even our villain Michael Shannon when you,0.047770165
really look at this film what this movie is really about is about loneliness and,0.037397955
about belonging and finding your place preferably with somebody and that kind of theme is,0.020567479
echoed through each individual character in the movie and expressed in a different way by,0.015720285
each individual character in the movie to the point that I just I was falling,0.025100704
in love this story it's so much so that the creature that IMDB just refers,0.049622037
to as amphibian man that the creature in the film almost doesn't even have to,0.03147915
be a creature it could have just been another guy kind of filling that role,0.09423058
but the airmen of El Toro uses him as a creature to kind of tell,0.07376155
this tale from a fairy tale perspective you know what I mean it has great,0.06269422
cadence it has a great pace it has a great two or three little side,0.03870637
storylines that run throughout with various characters in the film as well but ultimately when,0.0071128085
it comes down to it it's about Eliza this mute girl finding her place in,0.2138745
the weirdest of places this and phibian man this creature that they have and that,0.1449841
they're holding in the government facility and again all that you see in the trailers,0.020459719
but it's done so well with such heart and such care and such precision in,0.016995443
the hands of guillermo del toro I've heard some people say that they believe that,0.03881679
this is Del Toro's best film since Pan's Labyrinth I would actually put this on,0.029383823
par with Pan's Labyrinth now I know that that's really high praise because Pan's Labyrinth,0.039088186
is just crazy good but I would honestly put this movie on the same level,0.090653226
as Pan's Labyrinth just because it goes so much more beyond just what you see,0.016287021
on the surface and what you think the movies about just from the trailers and,0.012829397
goes into a real human movie about human experience in human emotion that I just,0.0777327
found myself completely enthralled with this movie right from the get-go now I got a,0.02386945
few other things to say about this movie but I also want to know if,0.04722671
you guys have any specific questions that don't go into spoiler detail but if you've,0.029215531
got any specific questions about the movie or specific observations about the movie you can,0.018424256
communicate those to me right now in one of two ways and I'll take them,0.16356932
from both number one you can hop on super chat obviously I get to every,0.06495784
single super chat number two you can jump on Twitter and tweet to me at,0.07135225
John Candy's just fire just jump on Twitter and fire off a tweet to me,0.22766542
at John Campea and let me know if you have any specific questions about this,0.03586404
movie and I'll spend the next ten minutes so taking questions continuing to talk about,0.024167452
this film so go ahead and start sending those out to me now now again,0.1059418
I want to talk about a couple of performances here and I'll go back to,0.03561859
Michael Shannon Michael Shannon I've always kind of said that one of the best villains,0.058163658
or the best kind of villain you can ever have in one of these movies,0.07880165
are the villains who do not see themselves as villains but rather villains who the,0.041764222
most dangerous of them are the ones who see themselves as the good guy and,0.185394
Michael Shannon is definitely one of these types of villains he thinks he's the good,0.08014997
guy he thinks he's doing the right thing he thinks he's doing the good thing,0.058149688
and ultimately that's what makes him the most diabolical and the most dangerous of any,0.31762958
kind of cinematic villain he seems himself as the good guy and at times the,0.09576383
way del Toro shapes this movie you there are even moments in this film and,0.08088966
this is what makes del Toro so brilliant there are moments in this film where,0.026774973
you actually find yourself sympathizing a little bit with the Michael Shannon character again I'm,0.0370627
not gonna talk about how or why because I would be spoilers but there are,0.03483101
times that you find yourself sympathizing with him which only adds to the impact that,0.024075657
his character plays in the story it's so brilliantly done on that level like absolutely,0.016247775
brilliantly done on that level and you're swept up in all of it okay listen,0.19901828
we've got questions coming in about it so let me switch over to those now,0.033075593
I'm gonna start off with this one from Alex Gerber let's see Alex rates each,0.023204267
individual element was okay but it didn't come together for me however this movie wasn't,0.049983896
my first time getting to give my cinema score you know you know I'm not,0.04123141
totally surprised to hear that Alex because just like Pan's Labyrinth Pan's Labyrinth was a,0.022310259
movie that I thought was absolutely breathtakingly brilliant but that movie wasn't for everybody and,0.036560487
since I'm seeing a lot of similarities not that this movie's a copycat of that,0.05443397
other movie but just thematically because I see a lot of similarities between this film,0.05656256
and Pan's Labyrinth it's not gonna surprise me at all that this movie also will,0.06665672
not be for everybody it's not going to be for everybody but not everybody is,0.01992092
going to get this film not one sorry it's not that if you don't like,0.044625174
this film that that mean you don't get it not at all but what it,0.0741886
does mean is that I think this movie isn't going to touch everybody the same,0.029753665
way that Pan's Labyrinth did I think this movie is going to impact everybody the,0.0589366
same way just like Pan's Labyrinth didn't for everybody I don't expect this will be,0.026813554
for everybody - and if it doesn't strike you the right way that doesn't mean,0.028603561
there's anything wrong with you all film is subjective but for me it worked damn,0.32700396
well like it worked damn well ok next one comes us from Sam Fisher and,0.2325539
Sam Fisher writes I love this movie I think it's Del Toro's best movie since,0.0468429
Pan's Labyrinth I called Doug Jones at the Andy Serkis of practical creatures and yeah,0.061069846
Doug Jones has made a complete career out of being in gambrel del Toro's movies,0.03262859
but also being these practical effects creatures and actually you can currently see Doug Jones,0.029024623
in that new Star Trek show Star Trek oh why am I forgetting the name,0.011885501
of it Explorer a Star Trek whatever he's in the new Star Trek series on,0.034255628
CBS he plays like this alien captain and he's brilliant in it he's absolutely fantastic,0.11260096
in it so yes I completely agree all right next one the next question comes,0.012764874
to us from John Carr EP who writes how is the CGI okay I'll say,0.021390976
this this is what I'll say about the CGI the CGI is so good that,0.026431737
I couldn't tell you when it was CGI and when it wasn't I mean there,0.026075864
are a few little moments I could do that looks like it's something composited but,0.037295517
it's some minor little details but overall I don't know how much this is the,0.040914115
biggest compliment I can give to the CG in this movie I can't tell you,0.04752072
how much CG was in it I even I somebody who worked in the CGI,0.04206954
industry for a while I'm looking at this movie and I couldn't tell you if,0.024772769
that's visual effects or that's visual effects or not or just practical and that is,0.010193274
the biggest compliment I can give it so I don't know if del Toro used,0.048406743
hardly any CGI if we used a modest amount of CGI but there are very,0.020604728
very few moments in this movie that I can even think of that I even,0.037319463
thought was CGI and that's how good the effects in this thing actually ended up,0.036817916
being Sam Fisher's writing do you think Doug Jones will get an Oscar nomination no,0.010501254
no I don't think Doug Jones will get an Oscar nomination for this mostly because,0.009800816
well for a lot of reasons but a lot because I mean he doesn't that,0.027672306
may be considered I won't say that let's say this there are an awful lot,0.060775835
of very good Best Supporting Actor nominees this year so no I don't see him,0.03497735
nabbing one of those he's he's great as a creature absolutely he plays the part,0.17598698
wonderfully but no I don't see him getting an Academy Award nomination for this let's,0.01372673
see RC is writing in is this a more graphic Beauty and the Beast ooh,0.06123348
that's a you know what RC I have not thought of the movie in those,0.020247525
terms but uh you're not she not far off this theme Attica Lee at least,0.045506544
at any rate you will see some similarities between Beauty and the Beast it is,0.044633158
a more graphic version of that I wouldn't say it's a Beauty and the Beast,0.12575829
story but there are certainly similarities and nobody can blame you if you came out,0.027573192
of it drawing some parallels but overall I mean it's certainly these are two very,0.02548119
very different movies they are very very different movies but it's not far off the,0.019362831
way you're drawing those similarities so yeah I think you could say that you wouldn't,0.031265628
be completely wrong to say this is a more graphic kind of beauty in the,0.03149445
beast but it's certainly one is not completely connected to the other Alex Gerber right,0.05978072
wrote in again I meant to say was my first time with CinemaScore know I,0.023568122
get what you're saying don't worry I understand what you're saying Alex don't worry about,0.04462451
it the uzi 4:08 says I don't know why you decided to waste your money,0.06978508
to tell us a joke but writes in a joke what do you call it,0.039383527
when Batman skips Church Christian Bale huh love what you do thank you so much,0.088962324
the Uzi for it I appreciate that as well alright so let me jump over,0.10332763
then now to Twitter and see what some people are saying in Twitter we will,0.034344096
start off with Lesley 22800 in an Oscar absolutely it's good at this movie is,0.07988589
going to get nominated in some of the big categories you're going to see Sally,0.0528229
Hawkins get nominated for Best Actress you're I believe you're gonna see Guillermo del Toro,0.02537476
nominated for Best Director and I believe very strongly you're gonna see the shape of,0.01764067
water getting native for best picture so there's gonna be a big Oscar presence for,0.046765737
this how many it will win who knows we're not really sure how many words,0.031130595
it will actually win but it's going to be a very very big presence let's,0.031880256
see this one comes us from Stephen thanks sixteen says is the shape of water,0.017491668
as darkest pans or lighter in the story there are very different films from each,0.0379015
other and both have very dark elements in their own way if I had to,0.02631134
just give us plain and simple thing I guess I would say that the shape,0.043997906
of water is a little lighter I guess I would say that it feels weird,0.020876123
saying that but I suppose you could say if one you had to say was,0.022247732
a little bit darker than the other I would say Pan's Labyrinth is probably just,0.07526686
a little bit darker than the shape of water is but I mean they're both,0.0901723
have some very dark elements and both have some lighter very emotional heartfelt elements as,0.015778156
well but I'll say the slightly darker one will go over two we will go,0.05073888
over to say Pan's Labyrinth is slightly darker this next one comes to us from,0.040435184
homes or Simpson who writes John this movie really shows hollywood's double standard we see,0.031810414
tons of female out Anatomy but no fish Anatomy double standard in Hollywood put more,0.07601386
efficient atomy on the screen thanks a lot for the comment let's see this next,0.03865648
one comes to us from T Olli reviews who writes John do you think shape,0.026220208
of water can get an Oscar nomination and do you think it's deserved well as,0.013803891
I just mentioned in the previous question I do I think it's going to get,0.013247132
several of the major categories it's going to get nominated a couple of the major,0.024742171
categories and probably a couple like makeup costuming some other categories like that I could,0.036805943
see the shape of water picking up minimum 5 nominations minimum 5 maybe even more,0.013724734
we'll have to see now I don't think it's a shoo-in to win necessarily any,0.057712663
of them but I'm thinking we're gonna get at least 5 of these things we,0.024516009
go over to this one this one comes us from Walter who writes John which,0.035997745
is better the last gen a or the shape of water well the last gen,0.07583094

the compliment I appreciate that Sam Fisher is writing it out the name of the,0.018551307
show that you can see Doug Jones in who plays the amphibious creature in this,0.06582325
movie is Star Trek discovery he plays first officer sir ooh that's how he plays,0.022381434

guys that will do it for my review of the shape of water I absolutely,0.049157735
