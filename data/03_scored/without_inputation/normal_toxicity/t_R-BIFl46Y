hey everyone it's Mariana and I finally got the chance to see parasite the film a lot of people are calling the best of 2019,0.25770736
I am here to tell you that the hype is 100% justified,0.098547325
so let's talk about parasite to keep things as spoiler free as possible all,0.36171108
I'm going to say about the plot is that here ki-woo a young man from a poor unemployed family goes to work as an English tutor for a very rich family on a recommendation from his friend from here he tries to help his family out as much as he can which may or may not involve some serious scheming,0.15925567
let's just get this out of the way parasite is the best film of 2019,0.31089434
not just for me,0.065361045
but you are going to see it,0.08917299
at the top of a lot of lists at the end of the year,0.06123861
so if you are here just for a quick recommendation from me you want to know whether I think you should go out of your way to go watch it on the big screen yes absolutely watch it because it's fantastic watch it because we need to support films like this in theaters so that they do get a release beyond just a few locations watch it because people are going to be talking about this one for a long time just watch it,0.082905054
I went into this film knowing next to nothing about it,0.08339735
I am a big fan of the director bong joon-ho,0.14863338
so I just trusted that this was going to be great didn't watch the trailers didn't read the premise,0.08472354
all I knew was that this film was some combination of drama comedy and thriller which it is all of these things and it was fascinating to watch this film more from one thing to another and just have no idea what could possibly come next,0.096108675
so yes I would definitely recommend avoiding information about this film as much as you can that being said,0.102820635
if you have seen the trailers maybe heard people talking about the themes of parasite obviously you're watching a review right now and you might be worried that you know a little bit too much don't worry about it there are,0.33764613
so many turns that the story takes different ideas,0.062560506
it addresses that unless you specifically went out of your way to read a plot summary you're still going to find plenty of surprises in there and you're going to enjoy the hell out of it one of my favorite things about parasite is how masterfully bong joon-ho handles these genre shifts that happen throughout the film you have satire and black comedy you have a family drama,0.31089434
you have suspense that crosses over into thriller territory,0.27301648
and all of it is flavored with really well-done social commentary the film has this beautiful flow to it that is very reminiscent of a stage performance and it made so much sense,0.06956089
when I was watching and reading interviews with bong joon-ho afterwards and hearing him talk about how important the rhythm of the film is to him and how what parasite in particular he started off with an idea of it being a stage play,0.31089434
the pacing is exactly what it needs to be as well the beginning shows us all,0.06096656
we need to know about the two families one after the other,0.036141597
and as the film goes along it keeps ramping up,0.042475935
it keeps winding the tension like a spring until we get to the culmination where well you're just going to have to watch and find out how that goes,0.08208518
another thing,0.058267165
I loved about this film is that there aren't any heroes or villains here,0.098188035
all of the characters are various shades of grey and each and every one of them has their own faults,0.13027465
parasite is not interested in pointing fingers or taking sides,0.31089434
instead it shows the problem of the gap between the rich and the poor it shows a conflict and the lack of understanding between classes and while every character is looking out for their own,0.10144804
the audience is left,0.04697468
wondering if coexistence is possible at all can the invisible line be crossed is there a solution or is it just that no matter how the power dynamics shift someone will always end up being a host and someone else a parasite the film relies on this delicate balance of characters and ideas which could have easily fallen apart in the hands of a less skilled director or came off heavy-handed with a less masterful script but parasite maintains this balance perfectly from beginning to end while also shifting genres and keeping the audience 100% invested in every minute of its runtime honestly it's amazing,0.15431704
this movie even exists of course all of it is tied together through visuals starting with the architecture,0.09999205
which the director had a very specific vision for he'll,0.051071934
they actually ended up building a whole neighborhood just so the semi basement apartment of the poor family would be exactly what it needed to be reflecting that in-between status of the family not quite ready to give up on their situation often throughout the film themes and ideas are represented in a very visual way which is something I am a big fan of because visual metaphors are always fun,0.061073225
however I cannot tell you the details because that would get me into spoilers one thing you can be sure off though is that none of the visual choices are random,0.07467486
so paying attention to details is definitely worth it,0.06001796
here,0.053441156
finally before I wrap this up,0.08981492
I want to briefly mention a few more things because I just can't ignore them first of all the cast is exceptional,0.2690045
and all of the actors are playing off each other,0.11385675
so well you completely believe all of their relationships and interactions,0.24563818
and the dynamics within the families feel very real this is one of the best ensemble casts I've seen in a long time also apparently 2019 is the year of amazing film scores because this is yet another review where I have to point out how perfect the music is I guarantee you're going to notice it,0.026239328
and it really elevates some already powerful moments,0.06533565
now if you've been around my channel for a while you know that what I'm about to say does not happen very often here,0.16968927
but I don't have anything negative to say about this film I don't have any nitpicks,0.18766156
I don't have anything that stood out to me as something that I wish would have been done differently,0.111094184
nothing,0.074627765
I needed more of or less off,0.15050733
I got nothing only love for this film,0.149743
so that's a 10 out of 10,0.12876841
my first perfect score of 2019,0.08861866
