hey guys this lady i wanted to give you a quick movie review uh double indemnity uh is the movie and it stars um and first of all it's a great movie this is a great um keep you on the edge of your seat um a mystery it stars uh fred mcmurray barbara stanwick and uh edward g robinson it came out in 1944 and it was nominated for all kind of oscars and probably almost ever all of the major categories and then didn't win one and that's a shame although honestly i don't know who the competition was so i can't really i got to be fair about that so basically um as fred mcmurray's character is an insurance salesman and he does pretty good for himself he's a regular guy nothing spectacular and special none stands out for him just regular guy working and he works in this office and edward g robinson's character is the insurance manager the claims manager of the office and he can spot a phony claim you know a mile away he's he claims he always says this little man inside his his his instincts inside he can tell when it just makes him sick when he sees some when he sees a claim come before him and it's not it's phony you know someone's trying to build the uh the office so he actually we actually see that uh a a gentleman in the office and he was trying to you know it looked like he deliberately set his car on fire to get you know insurance money whatever and uh he he's you know he has sent somebody over there to check it out and he's really good with that so you know so he his character is very integral to the plot so anyway you know um fred mcmurray's character uh his name is uh um walter nuff neff i guess neff so he you know he's kept going about his merry way and he's uh you know selling his insurance and he goes to a house where they have let their insurance lapse so he's going there to get the renewal and he meets um barbra stanwy's character phyllis and you know she's this beautiful beautiful woman seducting you know very seductive seduct just a seductress and she's coming she comes out in the towel and you know she's like oh what do you want you know and she you know she's like scoping him out although he's flirting with her he has no idea what she's got cooking in her in her little pretty little head so um basically i'm gonna give away some spoilers but not all the spoilers i'm not going to spoil the entire thing because to really enjoy this movie you know you have to um kind of um if you've never seen it before you have to really you know the mystery of it is what is just so fascinating first of all the acting is magnificent it's a shame before god i don't know who won the best supporting actor oscar in 1944 but edward g everett g robinson should have won for sure he is brilliant as um keys the claims adjuster uh the claims the claims manager he is brilliant his acting is brilliant in this film so they meet up he finds out that she's not that happy with her marriage and basically uh she wants to kill her husband and you know at first he's not really that fond of going along with it like you know i don't know that sounds a little crazy but after a while he decides to go along with it so they plot to kill her husband and he encounters um so they you know they they scheme and they you know whatever all that type of stuff and he has a daughter that lives there um with them and you know she's not that faith she's nothing she's crazy about um that's actually a stepmom not her mom that lives there so her mom actually passed away and phyllis who is currently the wife is was the the mother's nurse so you know and then you know so she didn't like her from the beginning so she has questions she has doubts she has thoughts that she this woman could have possibly had something to do with her mom's work on my murder but death so um it just starts to you know th this thing takes up speed like a snowball it just it just goes and goes and goes and then the stuff just starts unraveling on them and then i mean all kind of twists and turns this is this is a brilliant acting brilliant directing brilliant writing this these the um the the um the dialogue between keys and walter neff is brilliant it's brilliant as he slowly uncovers things about the case he is brilliant she is brilliant uh phyllis is just she's so evil it's just it's like this lady is too easygoing you know for what's going on so anyway guys i recommend this movie it is on a prime video right now it is for rent um what i do now guys with the covey you know i have this ritual it kind of takes me back to if any of you guys remember like hollywood video blockbuster video you know all those video stores some of them still around and you know friday night was the night you rented your movies for the weekend and then you turned you gave them you turned it back in on monday morning so this is sort of got become my ritual so i read movies every friday and they're like you know prime video you can buy the video if you want the video i think the the prime um i'm sorry the um the video to buy it it's 14.99 um and then to rent it it was like four dollars to rent so every weekend that's sort of like been my ritual just to have something to do some something to look forward to because you know i've seen a lot of the other movies on prime video but um it just gives you some new things to watch that's the difference to me with um other streaming services which are already you know they're free of course but sometimes i just want to watch something different i have watched i've i have actually owned this video i just don't know where it's at it's in my home somewhere i just have to look for it i've actually bought i purchased this video so um but i just decided that you know i just pay for it and watch it on the streaming service but anyway guys excellent movie four stars for sure you will absolutely enjoy it um check it out um thanks for watching like comment and subscribe and also oh one quick thing guys i
