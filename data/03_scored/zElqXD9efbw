hello and welcome back to mac at the movies today i'm going to review for,0.05852804
you the 2019 french film portrait of a lady on fire uh this was directed,0.3670779
by celine siama who also directed waterlily's girlhood tomboy and my life as a zucchini,0.6047
which later got a u.s release all done by american voice actors it's a it's,0.086629726
a claymated film nick alfriman michael sarah few people are in it really good film,0.097740725
check it out this one was released on lily's lily's films uh september 18th 2019,0.15175198
uh it stars adele han hanel who plays heloise uh noemie merlant who plays mariana,0.10932516
luana beijirim luana beijrami who plays sophie and valerie gallino who plays d the mother,0.11631223
d doesn't uh play a huge role throughout the film it primarily follows heloise uh,0.03544301
mariana who is the woman who is hired to paint heloise and sophie who is,0.15045549
essentially like a chamber girl maid if you will in the film the film does,0.19458853
take place in france and it was filmed primarily uh in uh brittany uh they,0.08990042
just wanted the beautiful landscapes and it is beautiful when you see it it i,0.10431714
mean it it's a period piece but i don't believe that anywhere in the film,0.10592946
they discuss a matter of what year or time period i know the director has,0.058100834
stated in the past that some of the movies that she's done she doesn't want,0.109201305
to give an exact timeline that just wants to focus on the film itself as,0.033851646
like a piece of art and by having a timeline it sort of takes away,0.22050703
from the overall story and kind of gives you know question of why would they,0.03823339
be using this particular cell phone and this year you know things like that so,0.07876395
by taking that out of the picture you're kind of given this you know ambiguous,0.14953494
timeline of when the the film could have been taken place um a good example,0.053514857
of that if any of you have seen the horror film it follows um it's,0.109337516
kind of left to the ambiguity of time because like the device is being used,0.070044816
or anything being used isn't really time um it can't really put a time stamp,0.08522942
on when the film takes place uh which i feel really brings you into the,0.10767383
picture as a whole um i mean this is obvious obviously a time piece is,0.11971218
takes place a long long time ago um and you know that's kind of what,0.13836664
you know and so it allows you to really get into the story um all,0.061377745
in all i love this movie uh which i'll talk about later um and and,0.11434837
what i liked more about it uh so mariana she is hired to paint eloise,0.10750605
who is uh dee's daughter she's brought in they've had people other artists brought in,0.17645931
to paint before but i suppose the paintings were never to the liking of uh,0.057706244
heloise and she you know she would destroy the painting something would happen it just,0.265583
wouldn't get done um which i'll discuss here in a minute or reasons why i,0.0779649
think that happened um so she's brought in to essentially paint the portrait of heloise,0.07673938
in secret so she spends a lot of time she's she's brought in to to,0.1450474
to spend time with eloise and to you know get a good memory of what,0.08224778
she looks like you know taking notes along the way she she brings um you,0.17239098
know just a little sketching pieces of paper to you know if she notices the,0.1554583
way she places her hands things like that so she has to essentially put this,0.21160883
portrait together by memory one thing i i enjoy is the the times that they,0.10394234
spin together they start to learn about one another you find out that at the,0.07582811
beginning of the film elise's sister died she jumped off a cliff some people thought,0.13126913
it was an accident um sophie the the the chambermaid she believes that the sister,0.19580927
jumped uh intentionally uh and when uh mariana asked her why she thought that she,0.1992214
said because when it happened she didn't cry out she just turned around she was,0.08559803
gone and looked over and and noticed that that she had left to her death,0.4316681
um hello east and mariana they talk on the beach uh later in the film,0.07772288
uh marianna's trying to get more information about luis and like who she is to,0.113753095
i supposed to you know spend more time with her of course because she has,0.092737876
to get that image of her in her memory to to create the portrait but,0.10791029
she's not afraid to ask questions that other people may have tiptoed around like the,0.2639698
death of her sister what happened and so one of the questions she brings up,0.69542736
is you know she asked like what about your sister's death you know she finds,0.69269097
out that uh that it was and uh there was an apology letter left behind,0.09390314
and she asked like why what did she apologize about and eloise tells her essentially,0.08289477
she apologized for passing her fate along to her sister which later gets discussed like,0.16874108
what fate and that's when the idea of an arranged marriage a a more in-depth,0.083902635
understanding of an arranged marriage that's going to be taking place between uh eloise and,0.08651833
another man who she's never met so this is when i start to understand that,0.33905193
it's not so much that eloise doesn't want her portrait taken like once her portrait,0.17664744
created i think it's more of a not wanting an example of a time that,0.124332994
she can look back to and say this is when i was happy that's what,0.10628706
i gathered from it anyway so you kind of see that she's unhappy with the,0.320018
idea that she's going to have this arranged marriage and any time that there is,0.10198137
a portrait done of her she either protests sitting for it or there there's a,0.27949458
destruction of the the portrait where you see the the the one portrait the last,0.2716432
one that was done the face was smudged out i i think the the reason,0.13128279
behind all that is that she doesn't want this example of a time that was,0.15472497
better so if she's in this you know miserable uh marriage like she doesn't want,0.56213766
to remember that there ever was happiness before that she just wants to know what,0.07538078
is so maybe a portrait made after her being married it would just signify what,0.1091264
you know she knows from that point she has no memory or anything to remind,0.2966542
her of what would you know make her think about those moments um the you,0.14114168
know the mariana she is essentially she is made to follow louise uh again to,0.056721892
get to know her but she is suggested to let her go on her own,0.083470486
one day um which heloise did not understand really um and which i get you,0.20147997
know that's the sort of the point that she's there is to be like she,0.10200307
doesn't know that she's painting the portrait so she just thinks she's there to accompany,0.13663018
her to make sure i suppose she doesn't do anything brash on her own and,0.4032121
mariana suggests she go by herself one day you know just six suggests solitude and,0.082828835
when she does that uh eloise comes back she returns after that and she was,0.11048673
just like you know that was a great idea you know i i had all,0.08783197
this time to to think about this and think about that she you know asked,0.084822185
like what she thought about and she louise tells mariana that she thought about how,0.12846361
she missed her so she kind of introduces this idea of solitude and how you,0.15220809
can you know how how solitude can sort of give a person time to think,0.10722793
about other things or other people and how if you weren't alone to your own,0.104388475
devices would you ever have those thoughts and and i like the idea of that,0.14909083
um you know one thing i personally like to do uh myself is a lot,0.24533841
of things by myself so you know going out to a restaurant and just having,0.04502694
a you know one-person meal and just enjoying my time alone or going to a,0.15198222
movie by myself there's just me involved in that movie and you know it just,0.07147399
lets me think instead of having that well you know while i love you know,0.054310065
going out to eat or going to a movie or hanging out in a park,0.2406827
or something like that with other people you know it's a different experience on how,0.06278219
you interpret your thoughts or what you might want to do so i i like,0.07309231
that this allowed her to introduce a feeling of longing in her and that you,0.18789531
know a feeling that she wouldn't or may not have felt otherwise if she was,0.09608655
accompanied by mariana um at one point and i think it signifies uh you know,0.07183257
it just an igniting of passion but mariana's looking at the previous portrait of eloise,0.097998016
and with the the smudged face and she has the you know it's all done,0.14971316
by candlelight and she's you know looking at this portrait and you know right when,0.07671782
she gets around to the area of the heart the portrait catches fire and mariana,0.15408903
just sort of steps back and watches it happen until later it's you know transferred,0.06420843
to the the fireplace to to finish burning and i think that it's both you,0.4196087
know a symbol of igniting passion uh in heloise and the the significance of the,0.09231394
burning of the the complete portrait is a way to start over and start fresh,0.34387532
so it's it's not so much as you know that she was trying to destroy,0.2703744
something as the the director was trying to you know symbolize the future passion and,0.07151295
starting anew uh also in the film uh there are moments where uh marianne uh,0.06280693
she sees a ghost uh like a ghost image of heloise uh in what i,0.3029663
i you know it kind of symbolized it looked like a like a nightgown but,0.13261652
also a wedding dress so it seems like there's also a growing passion in her,0.135069
and that she's being haunted by that and the the the semblance and of just,0.16655827
like her feelings of you know what's going to happen like what's going to come,0.15495709
and to take whatever you know time she can uh you know because she's just,0.15443504
being haunted by what's going to be uh beyond that there's while they're let me,0.06548396
backtrack a second the portrait that does by memory uh gets destroyed she looks the,0.15974028
the portrait with eloise and realizes that um it's not her like i mean it's,0.15459067
her but it's not her um so they destroy the photo the mother gets upset,0.352763
and heloise decides to sit for the the portrait which you know baffles her mother,0.24128863
so her mother allows her to allows mariana to stay around and complete the portrait,0.24016218
as eloise is sitting in for it while they're they're making the the portrait uh,0.088270344
mariana is looking at elise and like describing how she needs to pose or you,0.31089434
know about her smile or just little bitty actions um that that she's doing describing,0.24105057
those actions uh eloise at one point in time tells her to stop stop what,0.19861808
she's doing and to come over to her um sort of like it it feels,0.31089434
like an order like stop what you're doing come here like we're gonna talk and,0.19844134
it ends up being like a like i'm gonna turn the the table on you,0.30144674
like look at you know the the direction i'm seeing you from and then she,0.14115214
starts describing little nuances like mariana described of her and you you sort of see,0.40324947
this like passion building um you know i feel like if this was an american,0.17945446
film they would have you know started passionately making love or whatever that given scene,0.17386381
but what i liked about this is that it allowed that passion to build and,0.0905559
grow which you see later and done in private and i i really like that,0.09583371
so you know in this moment you see that she's sort of like they're both,0.078532405
describing just little things that people notice about you that you don't necessarily notice about,0.0901256
yourself and just you know little pleasantries and little nuances like the way you know,0.5154597
your eyes you know when you're intrigued about something you're you know your eyebrows rise,0.2257955
or when you're upset you you know your mouth sort of drops and you don't,0.6096299
know what to do and so just little things like that and i think it,0.07491848
adds to the story and the the overall growth of the passion that you see,0.056373756
later there's a moment when they're all reading it's uh louise mariana and sophie they're,0.060941108
all sitting around a table reading orpheus and eurodice and that they start breaking down,0.122524075
this moment of the story when when orpheus is the they're having an impassioned conversation,0.09939332
uh the these two characters uh the the book is based off and eurodace is,0.067485735
that they're discussing uh a love between the two of them and as uh uh,0.104789995
orpheus leaves uh your eurodice tells him to turn around and so he turns around,0.23989996
and then leaves instead of like it's sort of uh like a a way to,0.10733643
describe the that this character and which when i got to this part of the,0.07008269
the film you see it kind of open up and and things start to make,0.050180666
more sense and the things that i thought earlier in the film when they were,0.058300175
sitting at the beach and uh the idea of the portrait and the ranged marriage,0.07185158
everything like that um and why the portrait wasn't wanting to be done is you,0.12448381
start to see in this book and then the film continues and follows after this,0.02815672
uh sort of kind of like a midway point and you know it it's showing,0.14589655
you that you can either have the choice of the poet and you leave you,0.1370735
know only retaining the memory of what you had rather than you know the choice,0.10851185
of the lover and taking the moment for what it is staying around and you,0.093639895
know either it goes on and you live a great and wonderful life or it,0.15110794
doesn't and you know it buds out and it just is what it is so,0.060975734
in in this the it pretty much encapsulizes the rest of the film so there's,0.088382766
a love story these two uh heloise and mariana they they fall in love um,0.11777795
and they realized that that love can't be after the portrait is completed and that,0.06440531
marianne she chooses to walk away like orpheus did and you know she chose to,0.16814633
take the poet's way out and just have that last memory of happiness rather than,0.055077758
what could have come from their relationship uh especially in the world and at that,0.15169744
time uh who knows how that could have turned out ended up so the sort,0.09140096
of gather everything uh you know that they fall in love it's your you know,0.15348554
it's the story how you see it unfold throughout the film uh you know there's,0.047588512
no i don't think there are any real surprises necessarily uh i i think that,0.066109344
the film writes itself out as it should and as it's supposed to uh a,0.058311537
couple of things in the film i did notice is uh there's a scene which,0.07165942
involves sophie uh she finds out that she's pregnant and i suppose at the the,0.14993343
time that this film is set around if she were found to be you know,0.09110177
an unwed mother she may have lost her job what you know what have you,0.31089434
and been on her own to to try and find out what she needs to,0.14898431
do to to keep going um she winds up going to a local woman and,0.1306799
she gets an abortion uh there's a very sad and unique juxtaposition during the scene,0.46118155
um you see it all unfold and take place you know she comes in the,0.07947174
lady lays her down and performs the abortion as it's happening there's a baby next,0.46303248
to her the the woman's child is next to her on the bed and you,0.64533216
see this sort of connection and like she doesn't want to have this abortion but,0.23044626
because of what she's presented with she has no choice and so you see it's,0.16989872
like she's face to face with what she's lost and you see like a a,0.5415055
breakdown of her soul and you know it's it's a very intimate moment um hello,0.32931873
east and mariana they're there uh hello east makes you know marion is trying to,0.08490496
to look away and she's like watch what's happening you know it's you you have,0.12246683
to understand that your choices have actions and you know they may not all be,0.09627346
the best so you know that this is the outcome of the action she chose,0.053111684
to take but it's it's just a very like you get into that scene and,0.2064256
especially when it you know pans in on her and the baby and you know,0.3664846
she's crying just seeing everything it i mean it it sort of breaks you down,0.44660237
in that scene and it's just a very beautiful scene there's uh another scene where,0.10454176
he'll release and mariana are you know it's their last moments together and uh mariana,0.07793532
that she's drawing a portrait of heloise and they discussed like oh you can you,0.22492565
know you'll always have my memory you'll be able to recreate this portrait a thousand,0.12225595
times over just from memory and then she discusses a you know would you draw,0.10943055
something from me and hands her a book and chooses a page in that book,0.18585695
and mariana she draws a self-portrait of her for hallease you know it's just as,0.32515842
a a lasting memory you know something that she can look back to and remember,0.11958221
and then you know that the mother comes everyone gets dressed goes about their separate,0.09422691
ways and then you you have the the final goodbye where marianna she gets paid,0.14257944
for you know performing her duty and completing the portrait uh it's her time to,0.112237334
leave i mean she obviously can't stick around and she has her final rounds of,0.18754445
goodbyes and then she goes there's that final moment where like in the book hello,0.08701285
east runs down the stairs to stop mariana from leaving and she's like turn around,0.19831644
and you know has that whole moment just like in the book um almost verbatim,0.027224617
and mariana leaves you know it cuts out next thing you know um miranda's an,0.07436374
art show and she's showing off uh some of the art that she has done,0.15146618
uh under her father's name uh i you know i guess as a woman back,0.28043607
then you you wouldn't have been able to you know put out your own art,0.3022127
in some cases so she put it under her father's name so it would get,0.113824375
recognized and if anyone asked she would explain that it was her piece while she's,0.1121997
there this is many years later while she's there she sees a portrait on the,0.07386998
wall not her portrait but a portrait of eloise with a daughter so you have,0.28450164
that she sees it and all these emotions come flooding back come flooding through and,0.15139312
she sees that louise is holding a book and it's her finger is holding the,0.2399267
book at the page you see the page number that she's holding it to and,0.10865867
it's the page that she drew that portrait on so it was kind of like,0.11827906
a you know this portrait's going to get out and i want you know if,0.18790784
there's any chance that marianna is going to see this that i want her to,0.096635774
know that i still think about her and so like i thought that was just,0.11659422
kind of like a beautiful nod and she saw it and she was like you,0.31089434
know just reassured that what they had was what she remembers and i i love,0.10631788
that and then lastly the end of this movie it like it sucks you in,0.8227662
it's you know it's the last like 30 seconds to a minute but it like,0.08866217
sucks you in and earlier in the film there's a scene where uh the two,0.81901306
of them are sitting at you know she's trying to explain eloise asks mariana what,0.11496655
orchestra music's like and she can't really explain it but she tries there's a heart,0.09426929
support in the room and she plays this favorite tune of hers a vivaldi tune,0.098877005
uh and you know just kind of talks about the the piece while she's playing,0.14271541
it for her and trying to describe you know what what an orchestra is like,0.088462934
to someone who's never heard one and you know doing her best at the the,0.10710609
this film ends with uh mariana attending an orchestra show and she sees from afar,0.12471899
um she's she's alone mind you um which kind of uh harks back to earlier,0.3504837
in the film with the idea of solitude and doing something just for yourself and,0.07985979
so she's there and she sees off like she notices in the distance a woman,0.33559656
walking and it's heloise she's there by herself doing this in solitude and what i,0.14938562
loved about this is she notices it and and you get the the commentary describing,0.07921116
her entering the you know tour seat in the theater on the balcony like you,0.31089434
you see all this going on and it you like you no longer you're at,0.19087195
this point seeing through the eyes of mariana and as she's looking across at eloise,0.15215734
the the production starts and it zooms in closer and closer and closer to eloise,0.059261877
and you think and this is a another thing i like this i i feel,0.101669595
like if this movie was made in america you would have had her like look,0.11133848
over and like there'd be a like an obvious you know connection of sight and,0.124896646
the movie would have just ended the last 30 seconds of this film is the,0.10432574
music starts it's the vivaldi song that she was showing her earlier in the film,0.11231444
and you just see it zoom in closer and closer slower and slower to heloise,0.08265507
and you see that like all this emotion she realizes what song is she it's,0.13451926
all this emotions flooding back in and you see her like breathing heavier breathing heavier,0.35408056
she's realizing like it's it's that poet moment where she goes back to realizing what,0.11998796
she had in the good time and you see her she starts to cry and,0.26381403
the breathing just starts getting heavier and heavier and then the film ends it's such,0.07269927
a beautiful movie if i had to give this a star rating a solid five,0.07621857
it's just in that last 30 seconds alone an amazing piece of film that that's,0.07989923
definitely going into like i love little nuances like that in film and i feel,0.2396059
like you only get like split seconds of it but this you had 30 seconds,0.29136145
of what was just honest true bold emotion and how somebody by themselves would react,0.08050693
to something like this so i mean definitely like five stars a solid five star,0.06873853
this is a beautiful movie and i do want to watch it again soon and,0.09104686
just just really take the film in um that there's a scene in the film,0.052252553
uh i'm gonna put the the song the link for this song below um but,0.23030238
there's a scene where they go back or they they go out to when sophie's,0.09059178
trying to get you know find out about her pregnancy they go to this they're,0.11925711
they're it's like a i wouldn't say a party but a gathering in a field,0.22068898
there's a fire there and there's a song that starts up just uh like a,0.11420506
an acapella like a group acapella and you know just clapping percussions and you know,0.2395307
