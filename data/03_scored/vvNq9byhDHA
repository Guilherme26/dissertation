there has been a crime I paid to see one movie but discovered another the,0.10098117
old switcharoo mr. Ron Johnson continues to subvert expectations indeed who gets the most screen,0.08115077
time why this little later right here back of the poster before the plot thickens,0.086249605
this must be how this low-budget movie could afford all these actors who actually have,0.15571575
very little screen time she also appears very little in the trailer a trailer for,0.06799032
whoever cut it should be paid most handsomely yes that voice is fun to do,0.37263706
I see you Daniel Craig I wish she done it more everyone has so little,0.08846095
screen time and clinic take a quick place the detective anyway how did I like,0.09945693
the movie we actually got well it's hard for me to tell because I really,0.085062906
couldn't get over my disappointment and not getting the all-star ensemble murder mystery I had,0.15379949
been promised from the trailers I didn't live other trailer started out but I thought,0.0728888
the last couple of trailers were amazing and they've been playing it so often I've,0.06844241
seen it in front of so many movies and every time it played I'd be,0.060291212
like I can't wait to see this movie so they whipped me up into a,0.116710514
frenzy and then and typical Rian Johnson you know but playbook then he switched it,0.09778523
on me wasn't what I wanted speaking of being blindsided blindsided this film's strong political,0.17766845
commentary was also a surprise and it must be why Lionsgate is trying to float,0.059661955
it in as an awards contender it's been on the festival circuit I'm gonna invite,0.10416968
you to award screenings and I've been like not knives out really now that I've,0.1772781
seen it I get it and I also suspect that's why it's getting such overwhelmingly,0.077534944
strong reviews now I don't mind political films at all in fact I quite enjoy,0.093610935
them but again I did not appreciate the bait-and-switch and also this movie is very,0.093613535
aggressive and I'd say somewhat mean-spirited in its commentary I mean I kind of liked,0.30495298
what some of what it was saying I'm still not totally sure by the way,0.098370194
what it is saying but I thought it's like you don't have to insult me,0.18147297
while you're making your point Ryan right I mean after what happened with how he,0.07936822
dealt with the Star Wars fans who are unhappy with the last Jedi you would,0.15111649
think he would have learned his lesson but instead he seems to have doubled down,0.1319794
you know how he tweets about Star Wars well that's how he deals with this,0.0616397
situation as well and I even like the last Jedi but he made so many,0.05338987
people upset and I don't like I don't think he handled himself very well and,0.14726934
in that in that situation and I don't like how he's handling himself here to,0.085845254
be honest with you now speaking of Star Wars yes Johnson really does continue to,0.06534475
love to subvert expectations but not just with the trailer but the mystery and the,0.057994243
movie itself don't worry no spoilers but I wouldn't even call this a murder mystery,0.19547187
to be honest with you and I discovered that I would say halfway through it,0.10300944
when the movie wants you to and I was really disappointed in that revelation I,0.14878742
was like it's not even a murder mystery are you kidding me I'd say it's,0.31089434
more of a political thriller well thriller with like political straw very strong not at,0.1666416
all hidden undertones and Johnson's choices and twists I'd say are a little too clever,0.15078923
so much so that I had not only found them disappointing but I think they,0.16928644
stuck a lot of energy out of the film you're like I don't even know,0.23995262
what this is anymore in fact it's one the film which starts out very strong,0.06720639
by the way so when you start watching this movie you'll be like Oh grace,0.16746847
Iran but then you'll be like Moomin God but when it switches for my ensemble,0.16528694
and turns more into a film about honored to are mrs. Marta that's when it,0.06946471
slows down considerably and loses its energy and it's really unfair to de Armas by,0.14516662
the way I've been a fan of her since war dogs she was so good,0.3286617
in that movie I thought she really stood out and what's usually a typical girlfriend,0.113420025
role and I thought she did a great job Blade Runner 2049 movie I had,0.08173388
problems with but I thought she was very good the acting was not one of,0.1487592
the problems with that movie some of you really liked Blade Runner 2049 some of,0.16392499
you really liked this movie so I'll be curious to hear your thoughts about it,0.11800217
down below but anyway I think Ana de Armas is very talented and very likable,0.24199545
but here she plays a character with so little agency well it's the type of,0.0691291
female character we're trying to get away from you know in entertainment you know like,0.18818305
I don't want to give too much away but I found it frustrating the type,0.07787829
of woman she was playing also to make her the face of such harsh commentary,0.35199353
I mean it's not it's not doing her any favors I would say strikingly similar,0.16439255
when think about it - how ryan johnson hung poor kelly marie melt tell him,0.2070397
a reet ran out to dry in the last Jedi I mean she's already looking,0.10917493
better with JJ Abrams the stewardship you know I think telling Miri Tran you know,0.11134581
also didn't handle the situation as well as she could have although it was new,0.06627051
to her I think she was unexpected I think think it's understandable and she already,0.210943
looked so much better here I said in my commentary in the last Jedi the,0.061232433
Kelly Marie Tran was given very poor lines she was given very unfortunate you know,0.24857844
hairstyle and costume design and she was made the face of something that was very,0.16618313
aggressively trying to change what Star Wars lives and that was you know it was,0.06582977
unfortunate and I feel come bad because I think Anand Armas is like in the,0.1513482
same situation here now as for the rest of the cast they're clearly all having,0.07166135
a great time right and for the little for the little time that they're on,0.051337384
screen and Johnson has assembled such a strong group of personalities here who are all,0.0556097
very talented actors that they're limited scenes can't help but be enjoyable but I will,0.16322295
say that you've seen most of their best moments in the trailer in the trailers,0.08742378
a Frank Oz though he shows up briefly and is a delight but he's like,0.079752855
he's got two scenes and like a handful of wines but the production design they,0.06960987
that team also deserves a shout out because they do I think maybe even the,0.23096392
best work here the costume design - it's a beautiful stunning and really you know,0.108914405
a film with so much dimension I guess I would say the thrombi of State,0.15639876
and the thrombi family are really they're an amazing amazingly well realized murder mystery setting,0.4032048
and cast of characters I mean one point Lee Keith Stanfield has a great line,0.03558477
when he says it's like a living clue board and it really is it's so,0.06899345
cool and it's unfortunate that it never lives up to that but it's still even,0.10305763
the promise of that throughout the film is enjoyable to watch you're like any minute,0.09159862
now it never happens but I was still coldest it was still a cool place,0.07475639
to be are so so yes this is a political thriller and murder mystery clothing,0.36902615
only but that clothing again makes the film somewhat enjoyable throughout I still maintained by,0.044318445
the way that this is a fun movie to see for the Thanksgiving holiday even,0.064404845
with its problems it's still it's still so Thanksgiving you and so much about like,0.1448771
family fighting that I think it's a fun choice but if you don't see it,0.11791277
during the Thanksgiving holiday or if you're in a country where they don't have Thanksgiving,0.06775132
I don't necessarily know if it's worth paying to see it in theaters when there,0.047140997
are so many other great choices out there go see Ford versus Ferrari ah the,0.028713075
good parts though here are good enough good enough that I would not I would,0.14964458
not skip it all together you should see it at some point but I'm telling,0.09936914

such spoilery down below how you felt when the movie switched gears so incredibly I,0.17570376
mean were you as disappointed as I was I mean I see again I've seen,0.36243778
