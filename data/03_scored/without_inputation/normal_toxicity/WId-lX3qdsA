what is up guys Stewie and welcome back to another review from the London Film,0.08716964
Festival which is feeling even stranger and stranger to say as a month keeps going,0.05318326
up to November now and I still haven't got all of my film festival reviews,0.05137858
done I guess it's a testament to my timekeeping skills which are not good and,0.1580306
today we're talking about another film which has got a whole load of buzz where,0.09540389
ever it's been shown at festivals in the year so I naturally went yep that,0.06489064
I'm gonna I'm gonna see it and that one is portrait of a lady on,0.16625674
fire it's a French romantic film directed by Celine Shama and my goodness gracious yeah,0.09725257
it's fantastic it's an amazing film I'll keep it brief on the summary for this,0.09312244
one but it's essentially the story of a woman who is tasked with painting a,0.1374261
portrait of another woman that doesn't want to have her portrait painted suddenly realize I'm,0.23991102
doing a great job of selling this one they they have the love romance you're,0.102480546
just gonna have to trust me on this one and there's not a huge amount,0.15487367
else I can say about the story without going into too many details which I,0.05039949
think might ruin the experience for you just going not knowing much that's all you,0.2642739
need to know that this film is so incredibly effective at telling a romantic story,0.104257174
and the relationship between the characters are just so perfectly executed I mean Celine sciama,0.1865509
let's just talk about her direction here which is just stunning I don't have to,0.2075367
throw my hands up here and say I haven't actually watched any of her previous,0.31403533
Direction work she did a film called girlhood which is one of hers which got,0.15718149
a lot of acclaim when it came out ever saw it though I'm terrible but,0.09654862
she has written other films which I have seen she was actually the writer behind,0.17043887
one of my favorite animated films the last few years my life is a cause,0.09435035
yet if the name made you laugh just watch the film you'll be blown away,0.24333777
I guarantee it but here there's not really anything I didn't like about the way,0.059392273
she approached this film from what I've seen of her writing work she was a,0.12041035
very effective way of approaching human relationships and really getting at the heart and humanity,0.15201561
of the story and that is absolutely present here it's a film which takes a,0.05099682
lot of time to just let the characters breathe in their moments which I know,0.07710601
can sound incredibly pretentious but it's not the first pretentious thing I've said on this,0.15503794
channel so we're just going to go with it and it's quite a simple thing,0.066156656
but I love the way that she uses a narrative of this and almost as,0.101072595
a kind of tool to get at the characters as opposed to the characters being,0.07360594
a tool to get the narrative and I just loved every second of watching these,0.1026538
characters fall in love with each other and her performances from both the actresses in,0.128735
the lead roles are so so good here stars Adele hon L as the the,0.07094228
woman that doesn't want to be painted she does have her name still gonna say,0.24939837
it because I'm not French even better than her roles in films like unknown girl,0.4484611
and 128 beats per minute those are good roles but here she's just something else,0.08442818
she really nailed this character that's got a lot of walls up when we first,0.12072654
meet her but we gradually see her come around to certain things throughout the film,0.120062225
alongside her as the painter and I cannot give with the character names there's no,0.07246336
me Merlin I probably butchered it and we're gonna go with it the top my,0.43270478
head I don't think I've actually seen her in anything before and she smashed this,0.2666927
one she was brilliant and along side her nail the two of them just works,0.13687655
so perfectly in this film cuz you got a really great contrast between the characters,0.10297348
one starts off quite cold one of them is much more softer and warm just,0.112668
sounded like a serial killer saying now but that makes us such an interesting dynamic,0.3280625
in their relationship so as soon as they met I was like yes I want,0.092984274
to see this happen it just feels natural and that definitely comes from the two,0.06739553
performances but it's again one of the great things about sciama as a writer and,0.07412219
director she just has a fantastic way of making all of this feel natural feels,0.12727332
authentic it feels real it doesn't feel like it's doing anything gimmicky or anything flashy,0.09680235
it's just a relationship that is perfectly explored through the means of film and that's,0.038725685
where it shares quite a lot for me with a film like call me by,0.15309124
your name and I don't want to sort of dismiss this film is just like,0.18939213
a lesbian call me by your name I think to simplify it down to a,0.76839155
statement like that it doesn't do this film justice it's so much more than that,0.08820496
all that being said there are certain themes and parallels which which are the reason,0.037673175
I love a film like call me by name and a reason why I feel,0.12189653
like this works so well as well though for them deals so wonderfully in quite,0.082039304
different ways but similar ways as well with that feeling of falling in love and,0.054166682
it's kind of feeling like it's just you and this other person and it's just,0.12816198
it's just you two in the world nothing else matters in fact there's this incredible,0.103048
line in in scamaz film here which deals so wonderfully with that and encapsulate sit,0.18351305
also perfectly at one point one of the character says to the other do all,0.030915955
lovers feel like they've invented something new it's a line which is just stuck with,0.09743613
me ever since I saw this film and perfectly encapsulates everything that is so good,0.10039935
about this film it's that feeling you get when you're experiencing something so amazing and,0.100280054
so incredible for the first time with someone else how could there be anyone else,0.07786611
that knows we're going through here and I loved that side of the relationship in,0.050113264
a way that's explored so perfectly in this film and there's a certain point from,0.05916804
this film in a similar way to call me by name where I realized I,0.111484386
was totally in with these characters I could watch them do anything and I just,0.16586372
feel like everything they're doing and saying to each other just feels so genuine and,0.04569332
I find that incredibly moving it made me feel all kinds of emotions this filled,0.114175856
but what I also found really interesting about this film is that on top of,0.05746547
the relationship which is the main bulk of this and the main thing is going,0.070166245
for there are also some really interesting decisions made from a directing point of view,0.05790149
which just sort of make a little bit spicy huh there is moments that almost,0.07391442
kind of Teeter on the brink of feeling like we're watching a thriller or some,0.083461866
kind of horrors feel strange saying it but and I hope you know what I,0.15188499
mean if you see in a film there's almost this kind of ghost-like presence in,0.11090025
a film which I wasn't a hundred percent sure what was happening at the time,0.09091274
of seeing it and then come the end of this film it all just makes,0.095123455
sense and there's a point in the climax where it all comes to a head,0.17725971
and I just I suddenly got why she done that throughout the film and it's,0.068824865
just another layer to this film which just elevates it above your bog-standard kind of,0.20572327
romantic film ultimately just film did everything right I absolutely adored it I can't wait,0.08056649
to see it again it's gorgeous to look at and just in terms of the,0.075228356
way it's shot in its cinematography but on top of that it is so brilliantly,0.40381902
performed and so stunningly directed and written it all just works perfectly it's totally deserving,0.096435994
of all the praise it's getting and you have to make sure you go out,0.14913358
and see this when it drops wherever you are but what about you guys have,0.076278955
