Pixar itself must be a bundle of emotions as the animation studio tries to reclaim,0.04788391
its former glory you're watching beyond the trailers review of inside out I'm joy this,0.04492584
is sadness that's anger yeah this is disgust and that's fear we're Riley's emotions these,0.07285291
are rice memories they're mostly happy you'll notice not drag I wanted to maybe hold,0.04157265
more what happened sadness she did something to the memory is everything okay Thank You,0.019653516
Pat Joey great joy no the core memories can I say that curse word now,0.21366563
yes ironically the studio which claimed it would never make a sequel got sidetracked by,0.041716326
them in fact Pixar has a dicey history with sequels as it was the threat,0.07557617
of making Toy Story 2 without them that force then-fledgling animation studio to stay in,0.10501986
business with Disney even though the two companies weren't getting along eventually in 2006 Disney,0.013573072
fully acquired Pixar and even though Pixar insisted it was still semi-autonomous it became sequel,0.05209785
centric after the acquisition Toy Story 3 Cars 2 monsters University and coming soon finding,0.047172163
dory Toy Story 4 and The Incredibles 2 the box office numbers for these sequels,0.02379894
are pretty impressive with Toy Story 3 Pixar's most successful film ever but their new,0.019691432
focus on sequels has cost Pixar some of its prestige allowing its step-sibling Disney Animation,0.044091698
to make some big moves frozen in big hero 6 not only dominated at the,0.06325963
box office but also won the last two Best Animated Feature Oscars in fact frozen,0.01810896
surpassed Toy Story 3 to become the most successful animated film of all time but,0.035363823
while Pixar set out 2014 Disney Animation is sitting out 2015 giving Pixar just the,0.014736478
opening they need they're releasing two original films this year the good dinosaur for Thanksgiving,0.03753698
and this summer inside out and true Pixar fashion inside out is an ambitious project,0.041270655
that hopes to be both intellectual and mainstream ironically calling to mind some of the,0.034526356
classic animated shorts from friendly competitor Disney Animation on how the mind and body work,0.08212357
and let's not forget that the sitcom Herman's head already laid the groundwork for this,0.10880542
idea as well speaking of television inside add is a little light on star power,0.027980285
for a Pixar film going with mostly TV talent there's former Saturday Night Live performers,0.02017236
Amy Poehler and Bill Hader the offices Phyllis Smith and Mindy Kaling now over on,0.014350006
Hulu with the Mindy project books Comedy Central's Lewis Black and alas who would seem,0.003361173
that even here sequel itis is at work as Pixar already has a short plan,0.05840512
for the blu-ray release of inside out entitled Riley's first date but everyone might be,0.035109058
able to relate to being highly emotional well these personified versions of emotions ironically keep,0.017983906
us for making an emotional connection with Riley herself so inside out is an interesting,0.0827688
case because while I think it succeeds wildly as an introduction to psychology 101 I,0.052059267
think it fails miserably as a film now this is my non-spoiler review my spoiler,0.1393919
review will also go up today so I'm going to try and explain what I,0.030867182
mean by that without giving anything away about the film and I guess the crux,0.01624578
of my argument is that this is a message first an entertainment second and with,0.023694506
filmmaking it's supposed to do the other way around basically inside-out swaps it's a and,0.050955065
B storylines but even worse than that I mean that implies still some kind of,0.04521719
structure and inside out is is out of control creatively as the emotions in Riley's,0.019004297
head and logic isn't just missing from the filmmaking process here but from the movie,0.013252454
itself literally yes while I was watching inside out I was like something's missing here,0.044704996
this isn't a complete picture of the human mind I just I couldn't put my,0.054860357
finger on it I was like this is not a complete picture so I thought,0.07181389
about and I thought about it and I just couldn't crack it so I was,0.045046903
googling emotions I was like what are they give me the list of emotions because,0.030347673
I know that someone's absent and lo and behold I found an article talking about,0.04384558
inside out and how they had originally intended to have a sixth emotion in Riley's,0.01605088
head and that would be logic and I was like Eureka it was a really,0.024715563
bad idea to cut logic out of this movie because emotions are governed by logic,0.037219685
and I think the logic could have represented Riley heck more than represented her I,0.057058122
think it should have been Riley inside her own head you know the voice in,0.14038901
our head when we're kind of like when we talk to ourselves we're thinking things,0.033000425
through because Riley was really absent from her own persona which made it very difficult,0.030051667
difficult to not only emotionally connect with the character but the film itself there just,0.014264863
was this detachment and I think it's like you know the really popular idea of,0.044140257
an angel and a devil on your shoulder right which is I guess kind of,0.26579946
like the origin of this idea this idea evolved from that but the fun thing,0.048875034
about the angel and the devil on your shoulders is that you talk to them,0.2516573
they talk to you there's a dialogue you are wrestling with your emotions as I,0.059790697
said logic governs emotions but here the angel and the devil are talking amongst themselves,0.17811024
and you are just left out and I think that ultimately doesn't ring true as,0.0235036
representative of who we are I mean we all we all are emotional but we,0.022729991
are that's not all we are right there there's like a I guess a soul,0.02374506
missing like emotions are reactionary what was where is the driving force of Riley that,0.01526796
wasn't in the film and when we're not we're not all Yeager's controlled by an,0.058074523
argumentative team of five desperately in need of a team-building exercise now that said uh,0.019346202
what I think is the fatal flaw of the film I still did enjoy a,0.04484801
number of elements in the movie for instance I'm again no spoilers here but I,0.015220732
really liked the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film they were brilliant and,0.018430244
I was very happy I was like who looks like I'm gonna like this film,0.11614838
after all and then it just totally fell apart I'd say when joy and sadness,0.03208646
start their little road trip again I don't want to give anything away that's when,0.0281978
the movie starts to go off the rails but the beginning of the film is,0.015710972
excellent Pixar at its best and I think when you start watching this movie if,0.042022977
you haven't already you'll be like that grace is crazy this movie's great and then,0.09118337
you'll be like oh yeah it is it is kind of boring more on that,0.12628712
in a moment now I also really liked the world-building which I think does good,0.04160125
a job as possible when trying to depict such a complex and difficult and abstract,0.018388337
subject as the human mind I also like the world-building of San Francisco but that,0.057217102
was very well done - I thought it was very well realized so I liked,0.025964778
that I also liked the animation you know we talked recently about the good dinosaur,0.07207398
and how the animation looks really wonky there with the dinosaurs but here this was,0.066231005
classic Pixar everything was beautifully realized in the mind and in the real world but,0.07298195
the best of all was by far and away joy joy is offense pastic character,0.07373494
i love how she glows I love little pixelation of her skin and Amy Poehler,0.2072679
to such a wonderful and nuanced job providing her voice and I also thought the,0.028299574
expressiveness of joy was really good it was just it was the full package that,0.033798646
character more than anybody else in the movie just really came together I was like,0.02398253
that's a winner and then I also like Riley even though I think that Riley,0.029577391
because I want to get to know her better but what was very odd about,0.028065428
Riley and this occurred to me after I watched the film was that really is,0.0096651185
like not emotionally where she should be as a tween she actually I think had,0.08423154
the emotional capacity and maturity of like a six or seven year old and I,0.049623366
don't want to give anything away that's you could imply that's part of the message,0.02533618
of the film but she just seemed um you know a little bit not developed,0.06583788
enough for the age that she was supposed to be in the film and I,0.027265212
think that also made it hard to emotionally connect because she didn't seem like a,0.061687134
real fully realized character I mean I know the joy had to be uh but,0.024855917
I think that Riley needed to be as well and cuz it just kind of,0.017691225
created the idea that joy was Riley and I'm like wait a minute are you,0.043964647
saying I'm not my own self I just again I applaud Pixar for trying to,0.04193717
depict the human mind no easy task and I think that they gave it a,0.09217716
decent shot but all the dots don't connect I'd also say that I think this,0.2328993
is not a good film for children why well I think that the messages of,0.051078785
the film won't be appreciated by children I think they're a little bit too adult,0.22391821
I also think the middle of the film is just downright as I said boring,0.064243436
I mean they're gonna be like I'm super bored I mean I was like oh,0.025356136
man maybe I should like go get another snack from the concession stand like I,0.10235979
was really like oh I'm not having a good time and then also it wouldn't,0.01695154
be a Pixar movie if someone didn't commit suicide ah pics aw you just can't,0.1119105
help yourself we'll talk about that more in the spoiler review so at the end,0.019958835
of the day I guess I have to say that inside out is certainly on,0.026846146
provement on some of the films that Pixar has been making lately but at the,0.04485666
end of the day they're just a little bit too inside their own heads on,0.34328562
this one alright that's my non-spoiler review I look forward to talking about the movie,0.022779213
with you down below in the comments this is the non-spoiler review so don't put,0.0970177
any spoilers in there and then also there is a contest from channel frederator which,0.024894498
