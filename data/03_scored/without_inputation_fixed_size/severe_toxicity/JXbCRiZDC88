now that's I do a Star Wars movie hi guys welcome to my name is,0.027180068
Kendall anyway it's finally time it's the most anticipated movie of 2017 Star Wars the,0.019012945
last Jedi so many people were hyped for this myself included because it's Star Wars,0.044426285
how could you not be excited for Star Wars this one is the most iconic,0.060169186
franchise of all time so let's get this ball rolling so the last Jedi takes,0.046097226
place right after the force awakens and rain has found Luke Skywalker he's been in,0.03342681
hiding for so long because he feels bad then he turned kylo Ren aka Ben,0.079630464
solo over to the dark side and he wasn't able to save him and ray,0.14761555
wants to learn the ways of the force he's trying to get Luke to teach,0.052945293
her those things but he's like it I'm done I don't want anything to do,0.0770449
with the force anymore I'm just gonna live in my little Hut doing my own,0.11162646
thing and meanwhile on the other side of the galaxy the resistance is being tracked,0.02180472
down by the first order who really really want to kill them they have them,0.674754
corner so you have like lay up pull Finn they're all trying to figure out,0.070975095
how to escape him and thus we have a pretty excellent movie like I said,0.045214526
I was really high for this movie but I wouldn't go as far saying it,0.05297057
I was in like my most anticipated movies of the year that was that went,0.026437059
to like Blade Runner and Dunkirk to war for the pond apes because I I,0.19969212
knew this was gonna be good it's a post George Lucas Star Wars movie I,0.056788057
mean come on it's not without its flaws but I still loved it nonetheless what,0.10155691
really works in this movie is the characters and the character motivations that was kind,0.01417839
of the problem with the prequels is that though all the character motivations were a,0.017263511
little bit muddled they didn't really know what characters wanted to do what they were,0.09126452
thinking you didn't really feel like you got in the minds of the main characters,0.032734353
and now with the sequels you know that's not the case these characters are much,0.028668085
better fleshed out than George Lucas ever could have done ray gets a lot more,0.04122742
attention in this movie the character grows even more so than she did in the,0.030270511
force awakens rey and Johnson's direction this movie is it is awesome this film is,0.026083846
not quite as fast-paced as a force awakens as if you remember that everybody just,0.033425476
flew by this one's a little slower it kind of takes a little bit time,0.0623317
to sit the story aside and it's more filled in with the characters than anything,0.028796466
else so if you go in expecting the lightning fast Aysen force awakens and you're,0.03735605
gonna be disappointed because that's not here with the last Jedi this is a lot,0.041115
more of a somber slower paced film yeah actually which is across the board a,0.026281405
fan-fucking-tastic it's it's Star Wars movie come on let's say that's the one thing at,0.6835851
least it has to get right no all the Star Wars movies even the bad,0.028137268
ones have at least one good one or two great action sequences Adam driver once,0.025403364
again is perfect as kylo Ren this time around kylo is a little bit more,0.12408203
conflicted you saw after when he got his ass handed to him by Rey in,0.7002384
the previous movies a little bit more shaken up this time and this he's got,0.04239681
like this is cool badass like scar across his face it's like that's that's a,0.4149555
true villain right there alright so a driver was like a virtual nobody before like,0.10501121
2015 now he's like considered one of the bigger stars working today rightfully so cuz,0.01745575
he is a damn good actor there's a couple scenes between kylo array where they're,0.37791693
kind of for having this force connection and they're talking to each other even though,0.068803936
they're light-years apart and those are some of the best moments of the movie cuz,0.03277759
it really allowed these two characters to grow and allowed their conflict between them to,0.041100368
grow as well by far the best performance in saira movie with the Mark Hamill,0.02945034
as Luke Skywalker this is by far his best on-screen performance that we've seen from,0.026251473
him but we plays looking this is it's a very weathered old man a man,0.16029795
who is truly deeply troubled by his past mistakes and you could tell that Mark,0.020995857
Hamill had a great time playing and reprising this role for the first time in,0.047081698
over 30 years and there's also a lot of really really touching moments with Luke,0.027770752
so be on the lookout for those as well I'm sorry I'm just I'm trying,0.026568765
my best not to spoil this movie cuz the nice I just want any I,0.07939033
just want to get up and talk about I just want to spoil the show,0.024948377
this but I gotta be I gotta be the professional I gotta be reasonable like,0.042955562
I said this movie is not perfect it's got its flaws and this is probably,0.03583943
the most polarizing Star Wars film to date some people would argue that was rogue,0.07705022
one but no blast tonight is way more polarizing than Rome 1 there are things,0.033563837
that rien Donson does in this way where he takes chances and some of these,0.021054393
chances are cool man they are pretty heavy and I think not everybody is gonna,0.15200643
appreciate it so that's why I like some people now are kind of on it,0.043274853
because they don't like some of the changes because it doesn't feel like a standard,0.023943285
traditional Star Wars movie and I got some to say about that I got a,0.027313106
whole video coming up but I'm the saying like for the most part the things,0.084767014
that he changed the new that he brought to the table really worked and it,0.017602755
really drove the story and it really added a lot to certain characters but some,0.008597499
things that he took in a different direction that were really unnecessary like for instance,0.02402976
I'll do my best not to spoil this but there is a little scene that,0.02952085
happens in this movie that I understand why they wanted to put in there I,0.040948704
commend them for trying something different but it is cheesy it is stupid and you,0.4639752
take it out of the movie and it really doesn't change whatsoever you probably say,0.022780545
that they had it in there for some like some heavy weighted drama but honestly,0.037877552
it was pretty pretty cheap it's got some editing issues here and there just a,0.04854976
little bit like some scene transitions I felt like in the first actor a little,0.10148641
bit like wonky but in an even itself out and then those transitions never came,0.1363673
back again but aside from those things I loved the last Jedi for me it's,0.062386908
on the same level as the force awakens I think in some ways it does,0.037127227
things better the force awakens like for instance is its own story it's not like,0.034667376
retreading I were stepping on familiar territory no it's kind of its own story no,0.03526471
kind of does do a couple threads and nods to the original and I feel,0.032190897
like the characters grew a little better than this one but in terms of like,0.008904814
a wholesome feeling I felt like the force awakens beats it out I'm gonna give,0.089857
Star Wars Episode 8 the last Jedi a 9.2 on it's in definitely check it,0.029449675
out it's Star Wars movie of course you're gonna go see it just turn off,0.045670178
