hey there's hope hi everyone my name is Chris and welcome to tread talks where,0.010802583
I walk on this treadmill to stay in shape while making videos for you fine,0.15414234
people I stepped into Wonder Woman the same way that many of you will hoping,0.06872877
that the character that we get a glimpse of in Batman V Superman could be,0.021693634
fleshed out into someone whose journey we want to follow and what they've done with,0.055080533
this film is more than meet that expectation the core premise of the movie is,0.022888305
thankfully focused and simple we follow a sheltered Princess Diana as she's drawn into the,0.10627174
conflict of the First World War and through that premise we see her journey and,0.09248847
discovering who she is what she's capable of and ultimately what role she'll choose to,0.076387696
play in the world and right up front I'll say that gal gadot is spot,0.046966624
on as Wonder Woman whatever concerns we may have had from the limited performance we,0.019856397
saw in Batman V Superman is quickly replaced by what we see here there's emotional,0.0317858
weight and range there's believable conviction and a general optimistic sincerity that's difficult to pull,0.013515866
off and yet she does so easily and that's on top of doing an admirable,0.024459468
job of selling the physicality of the character she takes things that could come off,0.0590284
as cheesy or silly and for the most part makes it convincing and beyond that,0.14082336
I think I'll nominate Chris Pine as one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood,0.014423177
today his relationship with Diana is one of the main reasons the movie works so,0.04175358
well their chemistry with each other quickly wins us over and as the movie progresses,0.03160886
we see him slip easily between humor and drama and he ends up serving as,0.043681946
the perfect counterpoint to her focused idealism and there's a moment in the movie where,0.019821143
the camera lingers on his face and you see the multitude of emotions that he's,0.21094969
experiencing all in a short span of time it's a wonderful moment amidst a great,0.04589767
supporting performance now as far as the story is concerned I really appreciated the level,0.020979227
of focus they kept throughout the film almost every character whether it's Diana's mother her,0.012325188
trainer Steve Trevor or Diana herself all their motivations are made clear without hitting us,0.08851532
over the head with it and I also thought it was great how the fish-out-of-water,0.09162372
elements were just played up for Laughs and humor instead we have a story where,0.030222619
Diana's understanding of humanity is intertwined with her discovery of who she is and the,0.05479251
decision about the role she'll play in the world and so by the end you,0.036701508
have some themes that come to a satisfying conclusion because we've been able to track,0.015587248
with it throughout the entire story to go along with that I also found the,0.009611239
tone and the mindset of the characters to be a refreshing departure from what seems,0.01785486
to have been established in the DC extended universe so far Diana herself has cast,0.057842374
as a determined and optimistic warrior someone that we want to root for and follow,0.031122612
because she fights for something that is nobler than vengeance or bitterness and the movie,0.06170044
also allows for moments of celebration and levity that are appropriate to the overall tone,0.03794407
of the film and thankfully the climax of the movie succeeds not so much on,0.028078066
the shoulders of computer-generated imagery but because of the relationships and the drama that we've,0.01705797
been following throughout it was believable and it manages to save the movie from what,0.019784557
would have otherwise been an average superhero movie climax of course there are a few,0.058120422
missteps but nothing that Sully's the overall experience of the movie the villains that you,0.11793506
see throughout the film for example they're pretty one-dimensional and shallow in fact there's a,0.02765102
scene where they're practically cackling to one another over the fiendishness of what they've just,0.0796125
done it's pretty difficult to take them seriously you'll also see some moments that go,0.036620356
a little bit too far into cheesiness territory but the performances are sincere enough that,0.03133148
I didn't mind and there are a couple of moments in the action where slow,0.024533303
motion was used a little bit too liberally for my taste but I did appreciate,0.11396192
the clarity and the impact that it added to most of those scenes and finally,0.012168204
although the movie flows very well the final act of the film is set into,0.01629966
motion by a character making an unnecessary revelation it's the kind of thing that I,0.03333435
faulted guardians of the galaxy 2 for and it's almost as if they couldn't find,0.027779398
a natural way to bring that about but in the end all of this pales,0.04212741
in comparison to how much the movie does right this is a movie that should,0.019861719
give some hope to the overall success of the DC extended universe it's a strong,0.027455455
and touching origin story that leaves you with a big old smile on your face,0.17841955
and that's why I give Wonder Woman three and a half out of 5 stars,0.03561327
okay so that was Wonder Woman now this was one of those rare instances where,0.051477898
I was able to see a film before its release so it's great to be,0.033714835
able to share my opinion while it still may have some impact so if you,0.031378042
go see this movie let me know if you liked it as much as I,0.07776196
did beyond that over the course of the next week or so I'll be travelling,0.018417604
so the next videos will come a couple of weeks from now one is going,0.051668804
to be on the fitness side where I did a ninja warrior type challenge so,0.021143528
you'll see how I stack up in my current shape and fitness and on the,0.0712292
other hand I'll be reviewing cars 3 when it comes out in the middle of,0.029675838
