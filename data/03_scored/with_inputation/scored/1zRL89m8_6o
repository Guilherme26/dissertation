"yes, this film is three hours and a half long, which was kind of concerning going into it because nobody wants to sit through a three hour and a half film that they don't end up liking very much, but luckily that wasn't the case at all, and honestly, this is one of those films that are so entertaining and character-rich that it really could have been five hours long and i could probably sit through it and it wouldn't bother me at all, and it's actually quite astonishing because this film's premise and plotline is actually incredibly simplistic and there's not really much to it",0.1550967,0.9996122695902354,0.428,0.014,False

"and that's something that i've definitely noticed about a lot of korean and japanese filmmaking is that they turn out to be quite character heavy, and that's something that is just really fun to look forward to when i go into a film like this, and to me, seven samurai is the ultimate master class in character writing where not a single character feels underwritten or underdeveloped, and my personal favorite samurai character in this film, which is probably a lot of people's favorite samurai character in this film was uh, kikichiro, i think is how you pronounce it",0.090114996,2.640500715229985e-05,0.4369047619047619,0.0,False

"but one neat thing that i personally noticed while i was watching this film was that there is no way that quentin tarantino isn't deeply inspired by akira kurosawa films, or at least old classic japanese films in general, because um, not only is the strong emphasis on character really apparent, but even down to like, the music choices and how they're used throughout the film, just had this classic heroic sound to it that reminded me a lot of the same way that quentin tarantino would use in his films, and there's also this comedic element to the film as well, which i found quite surprising because i really didn't expect to laugh at this film as much as i did and it just has this silly, admirable charm about it that isn't like too outrageous to the point where it'll take you out of the drama when it happens, because this film balances comedy and drama incredibly well",0.05493369,5.042581501319565e-05,0.4452020202020202,0.065,False

"but what this film builds up to in the third act is quite astonishing, considering how ambitious it is with the scope of these giant action sequences, because essentially the third act of this film is just non-stop action, but it's action that contains actual heart and substance to it that made me feel a whole lot more invested in it because you felt this genuine stakes for the characters when they were going through moments of peril, but even on top of that there is just a lot going on with the amount of stunt work and coordination going on with these action sequences because there are tons of people on horseback and there's just horses falling over and people falling over, and i'm i'm pretty sure horses got injured during this, which is kind of sad, but just what it took to achieve what was occurring on screen with that kind of magnitude is quite astonishing, especially for something in the 1950s, because to be honest, none of the stunt work in this film and none of the action in here feels dated or cheesy and you would think that for something that was made in the early 1950s that there would be some element of datedness or cheesiness to it, but it's not like it's all very believable",0.08689302,0.0155321345062719,0.3953703703703703,0.072,False

"just just take the money, god damn it, and that apparently happened multiple times throughout production and i just think that's a really badass and hilarious fact i thought was slightly bothersome when i was watching it, and it's just the fact that some of the writing throughout this film came off just incredibly on the nose, like in terms of the dialogue, like, there would be a handful of moments in this film where something would already be pretty clear to the audience whether it was shown visually or it was something that was demonstrated to through more clever writing",0.5535644,0.9999530908789416,0.3863636363636363,0.04,True
