crazy records and I'm just so proud of not only the cast the people behind,0.3250218
the scenes ryan coogler for writing and directing this I mean it's just so much,0.31089434
to talk about y'all honey let's go ahead and get started okay not only did,0.113408655
Black Panther break records they made 218 million dollars over the weekend that was just,0.025349589
in the United States they made over 300 million globally and on top of those,0.064325154
numbers this is also one of the largest openers for a black director so once,0.26449424
again kudos to Ryan Coogler he did his thing he was just a young man,0.17874406
from Oakland who had a damn dream and you know many people would have crumbled,0.6595014
under the pressure of having to direct such a major film especially being that all,0.08151671
eyes were on him the fact that he was able to write and direct this,0.070385836
I can't do nothing but just give him props all I can say that I'm,0.10887747
really really proud of Ryan Coogler like I said for not only writing and directing,0.10072388
you know watching this film not only as a Marvel fan but as somebody who's,0.15720266
involved behind the scenes in the industry who's into camera and you know who wants,0.094906695
to get into directing who wants to get into shooting more films and stuff like,0.44057852
that I'm just really really proud of him and what he brought to the forefront,0.07634475
the hashtag Black Panther is one of the most tweeted movies ever okay they broke,0.15308778
all types of records online people were hash tagging Black Panther soul it will kind,0.23967314
of forever they created so many hashtags that they have literally broken Twitter and just,0.093564175
to go through and see all the pictures of people posting at their different events,0.057767384
and the outfits I saw folks going into the movie theaters with drums down in,0.09106822
Atlanta I mean folks were showing out for this movie like you just felt like,0.2414018
almost like a global connection with so many people with people of all races ethnicities,0.43262386
not only was this movie well casted but I love the fact that it bought,0.07428057
so many different black people together globally you had people who were full African raised,0.31585768
on the continent Africa you had people who were full African but there were raised,0.30105042
here in America you also had a lot of African Americans in the cast you,0.2661294
also had some Caribbeans in the cast you also have black people who are from,0.10132319
London who are part of the cast so this was definitely a global casting everybody,0.0962447
could see themselves in each and every character and their backstories so I really love,0.08686312
that about the overall casting even now let's start with Wakanda so we were all,0.06965277
excited to go to Wakanda and to check it out and to see how it,0.105169065
turned out and I just thought that the whole futuristic feel of it was just,0.0552948
really really dope so I have to give props to the production design on Bleacher,0.15327698
her and her team they really worked hard to bring Wakanda to life it definitely,0.09910498
gave you a afro-futurist paradise you know I'm saying a lot of people are really,0.27395302
excited to just see it and this is probably one of the best Marvel Worlds,0.08950777
I've ever seen come on to screen the way that they had it mixed with,0.08786743
some of the African culture and the waterfall scene and then you had the spaceships,0.24180749
who had the technology because after all kinda is the most you know technologically advanced,0.06421106
place on the planet so they definitely woven lot of that into it I mean,0.16794024
the people who did like the animation the CG I just a lot of the,0.13189213
stuff that was just going on to make what kinda in the background what it,0.05080397
was was just crazy it was just amazing to watch it and when we watched,0.19384086
it in 3d I don't know if you guys caught it in 3d it felt,0.2562365
like you were literally in there walking around like things were just coming at you,0.1505634
it was insane so I have to give them props on how they brought what,0.27307448
kind of to life I mean literally to take you know what was written by,0.15386577
Stanley in a comic book and then have it for like you know future generations,0.16593498
to see this and to like literally walk through Wakanda and be right there next,0.0741872
to Charla and everybody else it was amazing so I definitely had to give them,0.08597739
props for their hard work their team did the damn thing with bringing what kind,0.74443716
of to the screen there was a lot of black excellence in this film I,0.24248767
mean there was a lot of comedic relief as well so I thought it was,0.05983672
gonna be more serious but I love the fact that they threw in some of,0.07610622
that humor that modern-day humor when Sheree looked at childless sandals and she was like,0.099809445
what are those when I tell you the entire audience was cracking up you know,0.06694236
I love that they had some comic relief I love the handshape because that's something,0.14093326
that me and my siblings do you know I'm saying I just love the fact,0.15040977
that even though he's a prince and you know she's like you know the princes,0.15337527
sister they were just at the end of the day siblings who had love for,0.13168052
each other you know they just had a genuine connection and I just love that,0.05839123
like I said before the waterfalls seemed to me was off the chain the dancing,0.10037817
and the shaking and everything else like I felt like you know that was part,0.09792305
of my culture I felt like I was like at a Nigerian gathering so I,0.15037778
love how they makes part of African culture along with African American culture in there,0.17378555
and the references even the fact that the back story was set in Oakland to,0.012543046
me was just really really cool as well and to see like you know the,0.08246008
african-american kids out there playing basketball like it was just like everything just flowed together,0.352479
really well it was a lot of black excellence in this film you also got,0.39187235
a feel of the pan-africanism that was running through the film which was directly from,0.048309017
ryan coogler that's why i'm so glad that they had a black african-american director who,0.6683526
could kind of insert that into the film and i don't think that that would,0.10539035
have been inserted had it been anybody else so i definitely love the fact that,0.24155919
you know that he put that in there and you felt that and then you,0.089377895
also felt like you know the pride of the african people as well in the,0.44191468
film so like I was saying before I love Sri to me she is one,0.14881879
of the breakout stars in this movie Leticia Wright did her thing you know I'm,0.08817018
saying and that's who I was so excited to see when I was talking about,0.07922595
it in my interview before you went to go see the movie because she's the,0.24080093
smartest girl in the world she's the young sister she's an IT tech so for,0.31415567
me I've always kind of felt connected her because so many times you know they,0.089197904
tell girls you know you're not supposed to be into computers and comic books and,0.15435219
you know themes that are techy and she just naturally had the gift for that,0.06247062
and it just naturally came to her I just love how she was able to,0.122581325
basically create these suits and she was like you know what the old ones are,0.14691137
outdated you know I'm updating everything and that scene when chili kicked the suit and,0.24149644
it went flying and she goes running over there like don't be kicking my inventions,0.491334
and all that stuff like that was just so cute like I got Jubilee tees,0.09381722
from Surrey and for Yahoo Donohue Jubilee is she's like the young teenager in the,0.10831331
x-men and that's what Surrey kind of reminded me of she had like that young,0.15345393
teenage feel you know she's still trying to figure herself out but she knows what,0.08461289
she wants she knows that she's really into technology but at the end the day,0.15036102
she's just his little sister she's just a young girl so I would not be,0.6048287
surprised at all if Marvel ends up doing like the animated series around Surrey because,0.1261472
I think a lot of young people can really relate to her character so I,0.040508483
love the fact that you know there was that age division but that didn't slow,0.0795578
her down she didn't use that as an excuse you know for why she couldn't,0.11040784
do the things that she was doing so she definitely reminded me of Jubilee as,0.082987815
far as you know just trying to figure out life and you know trying to,0.07084381
figure out her powers and I was trying to put her best foot forward and,0.1622706
then even being so excited to finally go like on this whole you know fighting,0.2665471
spree with her brother and her coy yay so now let's talk about the dorm,0.11298919
Elijah's I love the women in this film and the fact that it was the,0.14877017
women who are the protectors and the warriors I thought that was dope Danny Guerrero,0.49540633
the way she bought Okoye yet to life to me was just amazing her passion,0.2424638
her fierceness and her fighting scenes was sick when she snatched off her damn wig,0.8671686
honey and through that nlgger and got the fighting I was like yeah I mean,0.3360659
everybody went crazy in the theater that was so funny and then when she was,0.36218995
car surfing on the hood of the car I thought that scene was crazy I,0.35647723
mean the graphics in that film was just insane but I definitely loved her character,0.19180785
and I also loved that she was able to bring that soft side acordes loyalty,0.15480563
to the throne of Wakanda and the people like her loyalty and her devotion was,0.09258937
just really amazing and the fact that you can see that her and Wahhabi they,0.074244395
had like this you know they kind of had like this love connection a little,0.104686685
bit but she didn't let that blind her and she was ready to take his,0.31443265
ass out if he was gonna stand in her way and I love the fact,0.8355208
that at the end you know when they did that whole little rhino scene when,0.24037926
he was charging at her and the Rhino stopped and then you know like just,0.10599935
licked her they just let you know that as hard as her exterior was and,0.42907867
as tough as she was and as tough as she's ready to give her life,0.2055378
for the king she still had that femininity about her she still had that southside,0.23074128
that even though rhino was able to pick up on that that the rhinos stopped,0.19167042
dead in his tracks and then licked her face I love that scene and then,0.74525
when what kabhi jumped off of the Rhino and they just had like that intense,0.19481142
moment and then basically she told him you know drop down your weapons and when,0.25430724
he looked around he saw everybody fighting he saw this conflict then he decided to,0.15086383
drop his weapon I thought that was powerful you know showed that yes she was,0.18505418
strong as a woman but it was done in a way that didn't do Maskull,0.15394175
ate him you know I'm saying they still at the end stood together side by,0.24214023
side so I really love that dynamic about that I really loved how they made,0.07578176
the dorm Elisha's you know how they were these powerful women but they still had,0.24043386
that soft side they still had that caring side you know they were even scenes,0.094302565
where she kind of broke down crying so I thought that the scenes with the,0.24203761
normalize days and especially with oak oye which is really remedy and so I definitely,0.02758272
enjoyed that okay so Lupita Nyong'o played the character of Nakia and I thought that,0.06535449
she did a wonderful job she looked beautiful in that film and I think the,0.1143486
thing I love the most about Nikita's character is the fact that she was a,0.058265626
dark-skinned African woman and she was a love interest she's who captured Charlie's heart Chawla,0.2990307
was really in love with her and wanted her to settle down and be a,0.1870777
queen but she felt like you know what you know I'm bigger than this I'm,0.18578252
bigger than just sitting on the throne I want to be out here helping people,0.24002865
and saving people so I definitely loved the dynamic of her character and you know,0.07628389
how much he was like willing to fight for Charla especially after you know pill,0.15090871
and monger came to power she's like we have to overthrow him you know he,0.40317315
killed a child she realized in the end that she really had a lot of,0.5876557
love for him so I definitely loved like what her overall character brought to the,0.10965466
screen I thought she did a really awesome job as Nakia so now honey we,0.072002225
got to talk about in Baku um hey Exedy how're you doing I got a,0.057388097
citizen tea on this one okay first of all Baku aka Winston Duke that's who,0.1959947
played in Baku to me he was another breakout star in the scene this man,0.2411376
is from Tobago but he was raised in America when I tell you that he,0.07002688
was looking good as hell honey every time I heard that I was so excited,0.30552837
to see him I mean at first he was the villain he was trying to,0.15493596
challenge chala and I'm like you know what you need to go sit down but,0.23973012
he ended up being you know a vital part of the movie and the fact,0.1018125
that instead of him letting his jealousy and his angst get to him he showed,0.34954026
that he was a better man when he saved child's life and he put him,0.25565672
in that little ice box you know I'm saying so I really respected him for,0.0968248
that because he could have been like you know what oh well you know he,0.0896269
beat me in the last scene so I'm gonna go ahead and let him die,0.8118433
but he didn't he showed that at the end of it it was about a,0.03707382
brotherhood and the fact that you know there are two African people trying to leave,0.5603039
their tribes that they have to stand with each other so he was definitely a,0.08542947
breakout starting me he was also funny when he was time I eaten that white,0.51985765
man the white dude was all scared he was like now I'm a vegetarian so,0.35994777
like this I'm saying there's like a lot of comic relief in this movie and,0.10984985
I just love that honey mbaku hey I'm gonna need to see him in some,0.11409182
more roles okay I'm gonna need to see him come back he needs to be,0.1599139
a part of this whole Marvel Universe I want something just dedicated to mbaku cuz,0.13891064
his ass was fine as hell he made them scenes honey every time I heard,0.9456982
that my got a little bit excited okay so anyways on to the next character,0.16221096
another character that I really loved in this movie was Ulysses Klaw I thought his,0.10414111
character was so funny he was crazy he was kind of psycho but then he,0.7396381
also gave that comedic relief when he was like baby don't hurt me don't hurt,0.13906682
me no more like I was falling out in the movie like this dude is,0.1840681
a mess and then the fact that he was like the only person the only,0.3168765
outsider to ever go see what kinda make it out alive I thought his character,0.1467459
brought a lot to the movie you know he was definitely funny he was a,0.069765314
good fighter and then the fact that you know he ended up getting played by,0.06617582
air kill monger that was insane so now let's go on to air kill monger,0.6298591
okay when I tell you Michael B Jordan he played the hell out this role,0.32150248
uh you know it's hard to even describe like night understand what black nerd meant,0.8060606
when he said that there's a message in this movie like he left me just,0.12533934
speechless at the end of everything you know I'm saying you know the fact that,0.068941355
he went through our bag he got trained by the US military you know yes,0.08772482
he was a bloodthirsty villain but it's like he had a reason for his thirst,0.29674342
and the fact that he was trying to avenge his father's death and then also,0.3661257
help not only you know Africans but free african-americans and black people throughout the disparate,0.53838074
you know he was that character where initially you wanted to hate him but you,0.31089434
ended up having a lot of love and respect for him in the end and,0.11984479
Michael B Jordan like I mean just the fact that he had this danghang Oakland,0.2146277
accent and he was himself he wasn't trying to be a part of the Africans,0.3492598
per se he wasn't trying to necessarily mix into their culture he wanted things his,0.10338401
way and he came to overthrow chala and he damn near almost succeeded you know,0.6663018
I'm saying so in my personal opinion I definitely feel like he'll monger is probably,0.12483039
one of the best Marvel villains I've seen to date he put so much work,0.15364271
and so into the character of kill monger that I couldn't do nothing but give,0.53490317
him props I mean not only was his body on point honey okay I mean,0.40956554
you know from a female not only was his body on point he was out,0.5154597
buff and you know the muscles was popping and everything else but besides that the,0.108790204
way he acted it out like he believed that role he was Ehrich kill monger,0.5183938
Michael B Jordan is so good and he's been in the game a long time,0.1554018
to see Michael B Jordan go from being a little kid in the wire and,0.1856949
then he was in one of my favorite movies Chronicles well he was flying and,0.05857952
doing all that stuff and then a seaman Creed and then not to see him,0.27870643
bring this role era kill monger to life I can't do nothing but give him,0.66903836
props he did the damn thing and I love the fact that he called out,0.7072437
charla for you know basically almost being selfish like you guys are in this secret,0.604548
world you guys have all this technology you guys have things that can help free,0.13460164
black people throughout the Despero and instead of y'all doing that you guys are harvesting,0.55763584
all of this to yourself you're a selfish king like he called him out on,0.7320967
that because even Lupita's character Nakia was saying the same thing and but I understood,0.09184325
where child was coming from like he didn't want his people in slave he didn't,0.39628926
want his people you know to get hurt and killed and everything else they had,0.77155626
been living in his secret land for you know for centuries so I definitely understood,0.104664125
both parts but the character of kill monger he stood by his convey shinsen he,0.47520858
was ready to die for those convictions in the final line that he set in,0.34993348
the movie I think about a lot of people to tears it moved a lot,0.106533326
of people when he said bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped,0.46727505
from the ships because they knew death was better than bondage when I tell you,0.44588125
like just that line that hit home with a lot of people I don't care,0.22466572
if you're African I don't care if you're african-american I don't care from the Caribbeans,0.706291
you know we talk about this all the time on this channel you know how,0.08878424
slavery just did a number on black people globally so I definitely loved what he,0.5103532
had to say in that moment and I think those words struck a chord with,0.09026095
a lot of people I know a lot of people told me on social media,0.074868165
they cried when they heard Michael B Jordan say those words he brought a lot,0.07212049
of excitement to the film he was definitely unapologetic and I got a lot of,0.090941906
magneto T's from him okay he kind of reminded me a little bit of magneto,0.17787169
because magneto in the x-men he didn't give a damn about the humans he was,0.5876557
