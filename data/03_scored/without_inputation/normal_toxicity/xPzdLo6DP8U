The Farewell Billy's family returns to China under the guise of a fake wedding to stealthily say goodbye to their beloved matriarch,0.26004583
the only person that doesn't know she only has a few weeks to live,0.1709886
so is this smaller flick one of 2019 must-see let's find out but before I get into my thoughts,0.2194295
let me know what you guys thought of the farewell,0.08172444
and if you thought this was as delightful as I did now let's get into some of the good,0.1529173
so the farewell I had been hearing,0.058684047
a lot of buzz from other critics,0.11849923
obviously one of my good buddy said that this was a great movie to go check out,0.086616725
and I gotta say I could not be happier to have went out of my way to the local art house theater across town and check this one out this movie if I had to give one word to the farewell it would be delightful director Lulu Wang and the cast and everyone involved took this based on a true life story and framed it in such a positive manner because looking from the outside in this is a heartbreaking story you know the through line,0.060367946
it's gonna be grief and sadness,0.08815301
and I'm not gonna deny those aspects are here in the farewell but the way that they frame everything and the way that it's structured,0.084964775
it's more of kind of joy and happiness and celebrating someone's life then focusing on the bad and that's what I think I just loved about the farewell was that they kind of put this positive spin on everything rather than you know dark dreary the end of days type thing,0.14824478
and I think that that's why I thoroughly enjoyed the farewell because it exposed us to traditions and cultures that personally I'm not too familiar with we don't see them on the big screen that much and it felt like a refreshing watch from the family dinners and discussions to the wedding ceremony and then obviously at the core of this movie the the way that the Chinese,0.07109536
people handle cancer,0.3543042
you know instead of letting the person know they kind of let the whole family know don't tell that person,0.12385023
so then they can continue living essentially a normal life like nothing is dragging them down because they think that the idea of cancer is what actually kills you rather than the cancer,0.44366524
maybe,0.038781904
I'm paraphrasing but that's essentially the lesson or the theme in this farewell movie and I'm sure you're probably thinking I mean personally I even thought it's a little bit dumb but you know it works and the way that I mentioned that it's kind of this light-hearted fun manner is because you can only imagine the shenanigans the lies what they have to do to keep the charade going,0.62921816
so this gram of theirs,0.17732632
they're their agent,0.093474045
grandma does not understand or figure out what's going on,0.14542834
and it is like,0.051288858
I said a lot of the humor is derived from this stuff along with the performances and the family aspect,0.05176199
at the middle of it again,0.056006137
I didn't think I was gonna be laughing out loud I got more joy than sadness from this movie because the way everything again the way everything was structured,0.05872398
you know the performances all the way from Aquafina to Han Xin,0.10196225
I think it is each of them turns in a solid performance and I entirely buy into this family dynamic because you know they're sitting there having dinner you know each of them are kind of laughing,0.22373745
bickering know maybe mean a little sarcastic here or there,0.13301936
and there are also the two dads who are brothers who hadn't seen each other in years they get back together it doesn't seem like a day has passed,0.088761695
and that's why the farewell worked,0.028570557
so well for me because it's not just this one aspect,0.15271953
you know this aging person that's dying from cancer,0.4417949
it's sort of this family drama also making myself think about my family like I don't know how long some people in my family have I haven't seen an extended family for years,0.09176504
I need to get together sit down,0.1630649
just have a big dinner and start to I guess enjoy or cherish or celebrate someone's life again,0.21741845
I thought the farewell was absolutely delightful,0.09141364
I found a very few negatives about this movie I thoroughly enjoyed it would recommend it to anyone,0.12586993
there's maybe one or two three to five second shots that didn't entirely line up,0.08024426
maybe,0.038781904
I was missing something but that was the only negative,0.12798417
I found here overall,0.058079228
I was completely blown away by the joy that The Farewell brought to the table from the beautiful story to the performances to the humor and light-hearted tone and again this family dynamic and also making really think about things I cannot recommend the farewell hire like you need to go see this movie it's a smaller indie,0.1101576
but there's something special there,0.039040644
and again it's based on a true lie like it's insane in closing,0.46886605
I'm gonna give the farewell 4.7 out of 5 awkwafina's,0.06768228
