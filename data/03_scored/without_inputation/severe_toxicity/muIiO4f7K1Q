it's the brand new movie from Alfonso Cuaron the director of such movies as gravity,0.03896446
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and one of my personal favorite movies of,0.017541558
all time children of men now to some Romo up in a nutshell it basically,0.33793813
follows this housemaid called Cleo in Mexico during the 1970s and how she deals with,0.013571077
certain things that happen around her and how she deals with some very drastic events,0.031902872
that occur in her life and you're basically just kind of peeking into the everyday,0.1075429
life of this maid I was really excited to see this movie for the main,0.073277295
reason that for the entire year is been doing the festival circuit and everything I've,0.01088706
heard about this movie has been incredibly positive every review of sin has been 5,0.07452917
stars 10 out of 10 really really positive I've only seen one negative review and,0.035097085
that's it every other review has been overwhelmingly positive which is why I went into,0.020404508
this movie with incredibly high expectations and also seeing the fact that this wasn't really,0.054428652
another big-budget film like gravity or Prisoner of Azkaban this was going kind of a,0.027458781
bit more to his roots and there's a bit more grounded in reality kind of,0.065139435
movies such as children of men and seeing how much I love that movie I,0.137546
was expecting to be blown away by this one and I'm just gonna start by,0.11347967
saying that I really really like this movie and I'm glad I waited a week,0.032258082
to do this review because I actually watched this movie last Friday when it debuted,0.06930216
on Netflix and when I first saw it I thought okay this is good but,0.020768363
I don't quite see the hype around it now that I've had a week or,0.028444583
so to really process the movie a bit more and let it resonate with me,0.08381447
and let maybe sit on it a bit more and let it let me think,0.13745753
about a bit more I start to see why people love it so much and,0.07988789
that's why I'm glad I waited this long to do the review because if I,0.027795363
would have done the review straightaway after seeing it I don't think my review would,0.063931465
have been as coherent as I would have wanted it to be but now that,0.030650998
I've given it time to think about it you are getting my full honest opinion,0.030962303
on the movie and I've got to say I really really like this movie so,0.050122254
to start with I'm actually going to address my one and only criticism with the,0.022578994
movie first and then talk about what I really liked about the movie after that,0.04095203
my main problem with the film is that the first half of the movie is,0.02037657
very slow to get through and especially within the first 30 to 40 minutes it,0.056651697
kind of gave off this impression of like okay what I'm looking at is very,0.06345386
nice this is very nice-looking shots but what is the point of the stuff that,0.14777055
I'm seeing and it wasn't until about 40 50 minutes into the movie that it,0.04748214
started to click and then the second half of the movie happens and it flows,0.035934553
a lot smoother and just feels like it knows what it's doing a bit more,0.058417093
but unfortunately that first act sorry that first half of the movie just feels a,0.027401576
bit meandering and like it doesn't quite know where it's going plot wise it is,0.07483183
straightforward to watch but there is no exact point to the stuff you're seeing it's,0.023306705
only about halfway through the movie onwards where there really is a point to the,0.020543532
stuff you're seeing and it gets a lot better because of that apart from the,0.02847385
fact that the first act was quite slow and took a while to really get,0.039542507
to the point the rest of the movie is a sight to behold and features,0.014352002
some of the best filmmaking of sinal year what quorum is able to do with,0.028083388
the camera in this movie is utterly mind-boggling like especially seeing that with a story,0.05222623
like this you would expect it to be kind of a little bit like children,0.2682602
of men a lot of long takes with kind of iffy all over the place,0.07668703
camera work that is still very cohesive but you can still tell what's going on,0.026028637
that's not the case in Roma with Roma every single shot has a perfectionist quality,0.10342675
to it like all of the the shot compositions and the way things are lit,0.08006882
and just everything feels like they spent ages setting up each individual shot as perfectly,0.12395431
as they could and you wouldn't really expect that with a story like this but,0.021995628
the way that they choose to present it really works for the sake of this,0.015392349
movie and the cinematography in my opinion kind of like how the film plays out,0.026668543
just gets better and better as the film goes on specifically with a few moments,0.04146023
in particular that utilize some of currents like key film techniques which is like a,0.02291092
lot going on in one single shot and one moment in particular where this happens,0.10751097
is where Clio and another character are in a furniture shop and riot breaks off,0.022668129
outside of the shop it's one single shot but what they are able to pull,0.046556205
off in said shot is utterly brilliant and you can it's one of those movies,0.14713928
where so much is happening in these long unbroken takes that you can really appreciate,0.028629504
the amount of effort and coordination and skill that was used to pull off said,0.024182087
shots I don't really get that a lot with movies but when a movie does,0.030949665
come along and show off so much skill happening at once you just can't help,0.034395315
but sit back and appreciate what you're seeing and I definitely got that with Roma,0.018168826
there were some moments where I just kind of had to stop analyzing it for,0.038219456
a minute and really just take in the amount of filmmaking prowess and skill that,0.03838908
I was seeing on the screen just because of how impressive it is I also,0.022142634
thought the sound was quite interesting in this movie as well and sound really isn't,0.015311197
something that I talk about with movies that often unless it's the soundtrack this movie,0.02066659
doesn't have a soundtrack I mean the only music you really hear in the movie,0.019631565
is stuff that happens within the frame like if a marching band walks past you,0.012956447
hear them if someone turns a radio on you're hearing the music from the radio,0.10098352
apart from that there is no actual soundtrack or score that backs the movie that's,0.02471889
the only type of music you hear in the film and again it kind of,0.017869493
works there are a few points in the movie where the movie feels a bit,0.02778073
naked because it doesn't have a score then the movie just keeps going and you,0.12213437
kind of have to remember that he's going for this uber realistic feel so it,0.02700313
kind of works because of that it's a bit of a tricky one it works,0.059319746
in some places for the most part but there are other points where it feels,0.014652666
like that could have benefited a little bit more from a really good school or,0.044095688
soundtrack especially near the end of the movie but yeah I thought that was quite,0.04085292
interesting the sound design is also bloody impressive here they use a lot of 3d,0.20078501
effects and what I mean 3d I don't mean popping out in front of you,0.061902653
I mean like they utilize every single space of sound like if something happens off,0.0713323
screen that that is just to the right you are hearing it from that direction,0.02252578
they take advantage of every aspect of where the sound is coming from and it,0.027012443
is bloody impressive it's hard to describe without actually seeing it and hearing it but,0.17840359
if you've seen the film you know exactly what I mean the acting is also,0.027907114
really good as well and what surprised me the most about this is that I,0.015614521
think almost everyone in the film is a first-time actor I can't remember their names,0.0136681935
and I don't want to try pronouncing them just in case I butcher them but,0.27414882
the woman who plays Cleo in particular is really good in the movie and she's,0.116104476
the one actress I definitely know as a first-time actor not sure about the others,0.035572693
but I have heard some people say that a lot of the actors in this,0.014616081
movie this is their first time properly acting and they are all really good especially,0.035510164
the child performances they don't get much to do but they're better than most child,0.05858206
performances I'll say that they're not annoying or taking up the main focus of the,0.034109954
movie they're just good for what their purpose in the movie is in the end,0.03551083
I really really like Troma I don't know if I love it just yet but,0.03678532
I think the more I watch this movie I think I'll just appreciate it more,0.03368091
and more with each viewing and I love those kind of movies movies that either,0.013245802
don't click with you at first viewing or you kind of like but want to,0.043586157
love in the future and they do that the more you watch it the more,0.027424192
you love it I'd love movies like that and I feel that Romo is one,0.043867532
of those movies one that I think is really good but I know I will,0.03284344
love years down the line the more I think about it appreciate it and re-watch,0.04285645
it which is why at this moment in time I'm going to give Romo an,0.02689271
8.5 out of 10 I know what you're thinking oh it should be a 10,0.023490295
or a 9 like I just said I know that in the future I will,0.036281776
appreciate this movie a whole lot more than I do now and that being said,0.037792407
I appreciate this movie quite a bit now especially from a filmmaking standpoint but at,0.037976
this moment in time I think an 8.5 perfectly reflects how I feel about the,0.018661726
movie at the moment so guys that was my review of Romo and that's probably,0.06311994
going to be my last review of the year unless I end up seeing Aquaman,0.0479624
before the year is over then I will try my best to get review out,0.019231124
