"Dunkirk is a true story of 400,000 soldiers stranded on a beach desperately awaiting evacuation",0.022557708
as the enemy slowly closes in Dunkirk as directed by the savior of Batman himself,0.104366645
Christopher Nolan either guys how are you so before we dive into Dunkirk there's a,0.025408685
few things I need to let you know about myself the first thing is it's,0.034594204
four o'clock in the morning I'm drinking a Red Bull and did you know I'm,0.07839855
utterly insane and the other thing is going into this film I wasn't as excited,0.19642209
as I wanted to be and the last thing I wanted to let you know,0.031029487
is I am by no means a Christopher Nolan fanboy and if you're asking yourself,0.0476644
right now John don't you love the Dark Knight trilogy maybe more than you should,0.026165664
and that I would say you're absolutely right I do enjoy that trilogy along with,0.064978465
inception and a prestige but I do have issues with a lot of other Christopher,0.020513598
Nolan films I could probably sit around for 12 hours talking about my issues with,0.07674822
the film interstellar but I'm not going to do that I just wanted to let,0.039362907
you guys know those things so now let's talk about the film Dunkirk now the,0.014683263
film Dunkirk is based on true events and when you make a film like this,0.016242454
interjecting as much realism into it as possible will always make for a better story,0.027065657
and going into this movie I wanted to see a great war film where you,0.14886677
got to see Christopher Nolan utilize his talents that separate him from other directors and,0.022461256
in many ways I feel like I got the film I didn't know I wanted,0.032296
to see but I got it and it was told and only a way that,0.009967777
Christopher Nolan could have made it this movie by no means is total with that,0.024456142
standard Hollywood storytelling structure and neither is the character development and we'll talk about both,0.011276193
those things in just one second and when it comes to Christopher Nolan he likes,0.031052768
to bring a level of practicality and realism to his films and when you combine,0.13925552
those realistic filmmaking techniques along with a true story the level of realism for me,0.04644911
at least it definitely impacted me it felt real I could feel the explosions I,0.05603374
could see the despair and when people were trying to survive and doing anything that,0.0482777
it took I emotionally was invested just based on that because any time a filmmaker,0.023396505
can utilize practicality in a film it will always go further telling the story then,0.024804033
green screens or digital explosions ever could my point is whenever a film can utilize,0.02572265
practical effects you don't feel like there's this wall of CG in front of you,0.04723868
and the film what's that gone you feel like you're immersed into the movie and,0.039556477
you buy into everything that you're seeing up on the big screen now let's talk,0.026401805
about the story of Dunkirk itself this is a fascinating story and going into the,0.0209912
movie I knew a little bit about it but I had no clue of all,0.026967876
the elements that the film was going to include I thought the movie was going,0.016104097
to be just about soldier stuck on a beach waiting for fisherman to come pick,0.0321297
them up but there's so much more to this movie now when I tell you,0.034310836
this story try to put yourself in this situation because that's what I do when,0.024226654
I watch movies like this and it just really it sends chills down my spine,0.07497218
because it scares me and it makes me question what I would do in these,0.031670723
"situations 400,000 soldiers are stranded on a beach desperately trying to get evacuated while the",0.021648401
enemy surrounds them and slowly closes in and overhead there's enemy bomber planes dropping bombs,0.23080099
on them and there's nowhere to hide and the only way out of this deathtrap,0.24104513
is to get on one of these boats where there's not enough for everyone it's,0.045541134
almost like the Titanic there's only so many lifeboats for the passengers on board and,0.019322254
everyone left behind is going to die and it's not like the movie Titanic where,0.34461108
if you pull it around on a door watching your boyfriend slowly freeze to death,0.65459317
you're going to survive now this movie's an hour and 26 minutes long and for,0.057908893
a nolan film that seems rather short and going into the movie i thought that,0.08011671
might have been a weak point but after watching the movie i understand it because,0.03155964
this movie has no filler it has no fluff it gets straight to the point,0.09204146
and it never stops and in many ways this film is one big action sequence,0.029212205
where you never get a chance to breathe or relax and I think that's what's,0.038387083
so pivotal about this film is it makes you feel like you're in the situation,0.035134334
you can feel the suspense you can feel the desperation of the characters now let's,0.016732695
talk about the characters in this film and most importantly the character development in this,0.011097924
movie which seems to be everyone's biggest issue with this film the film Dunkirk doesn't,0.03433013
contain a lot of those other war film cliches that you've come to known over,0.08621645
the last thirty years of war and most other war films to get to know,0.041581295
the characters there is always that one scene where they're sitting down bullets are flying,0.12169868
overhead and they're talking to each other about their lives back home there's always the,0.034076694
intellectual guy the guy from the south who likes to go hunting and there's also,0.07758503
always that other guy from Brooklyn who says something like this you know what I'm,0.03395829
going to do when this was over I'm going to go back home to Coney,0.08406658
Island and get a hot dog this big yeah they always say something like that,0.091777384
and in the film Dunkirk there are no scenes like that because in reality which,0.02528496
was what Dunkirk was trying to go for there is no time to sit around,0.03044479
talking about eating hotdogs when you're trying to claw your way to survive there is,0.029993795
no point where the characters have time to relax and share stories like that nor,0.013247797
do they care too so when it comes to the characters and the development of,0.016612297
the characters in this movie I learned a lot about all the main characters in,0.01887126
this film because their actions speak louder than words one of the main characters in,0.029402448
this film is a young soldier named Tommy and throughout the film his character is,0.0054744612
doing everything he can possibly think of to get aboard one of these ships just,0.04891428
for a chance to survive his character is always thinking outside of the box he,0.0162817
refuses to wait in a line with 20 other thousand guys to get aboard a,0.038431652
ship he knows he'll never get on and the way that he thought his mindset,0.06442836
it kind of resonated with me because I thought to myself I would probably be,0.030293794
doing the same things he's doing to get off this Beach I understood his motivations,0.07246843
I got him as a person true I didn't understand his hobbies or where he,0.055748377
was from or if he had a girlfriend or not but those things weren't relevant,0.051799845
to the situation that he was in I learned everything about him as a man,0.06994672
that I needed to know he was a good person he wanted to help other,0.022907594
people and on the flip side of that in the film Dunkirk you see cowards,0.3749881
you see men that will kill and call their way to survive while they step,0.36034048
on the heads of others to do it so as far as the character development,0.093887344
goes in the film Dunkirk it could be considered its weakest element but for me,0.024142176
it was one of my biggest positives with the film because I understood who these,0.114261255
characters were in this situation and in some other films that way of storytelling you,0.03535318
might not quite pan out but with this situation that they're in and the events,0.020157725
happening around them it's all you needed to know as a viewer to root for,0.0327277
them and I was rooting for this character Tommy I wanted to see him make,0.027690265
it off of this beach and back home now this film has a lot of,0.06316517
characters in it but I want to talk about one more main character and that's,0.01912403
played by Tom Hart and Tom Hardy in this film plays a British fighter pilot,0.0012588646
protecting these soldiers from the sky against enemy planes and aerial attacks and every scene,0.09982278
throughout this movie with Tom Hardy and his fighter plane having dogfights with enemy planes,0.06461993
and protecting boats in the ocean down below were some of the best scenes in,0.040940724
the film during some of these aerial dogfight scenes you get a POV shot of,0.17768586
what Tom Hardy sees in his cockpit as he lines up the enemy plane in,0.076682374
his sights before he takes it down and when I was watching it it almost,0.0706598
gave me an adrenaline rush like I have a fear of heights and I just,0.048545104
felt tingly all over just I really enjoyed watching that it felt like I was,0.033887114
there it was intense it was amazing to watch I really enjoyed it and I,0.058087826
really haven't seen a film capture dog fighting like that with a sense of realism,0.017335352
well I guess ever I mean Top Gun was pretty good but I bought into,0.048792552
this movie a little bit more also one other quick thing I wanted to mention,0.13988213
about this movie is it's a pg-13 movie and it's one of those movies that,0.045659535
definitely lends itself to be rated R because there are gruesome events happening there's bombs,0.17396614
there's bullets there's explosions I thought the movie did a good job at showcasing how,0.24821833
violent these events were without the blood guts and gore not to say that those,0.5168681
things don't work in other war movies like Saving Private Ryan where the shock value,0.05480581
is truly there but in this film I didn't think it was necessary throughout this,0.020611381
film there are multiple storylines being told at once some of those storylines span the,0.013851784
course of five days some an hour and they mix all those things together where,0.027117541
you might be confused a few times throughout the movie and during the first half,0.03190088
of the movie I had to think for a few seconds when they jump to,0.05420249
another storyline I was like wait wait where what's happening what are we doing so,0.017886123
that element might be confusing to some people me personally I like the way the,0.02548518
movie was told it made it more suspenseful with that method now here my final,0.039873105
flicking thoughts on the film Dunkirk I really didn't think I would enjoyed this movie,0.035427015
as much as I did it felt like a true cinematic experience and it made,0.032586683
me feel something as a viewer as a guy who just likes movies I really,0.08335416
enjoyed the experience of watching this movie I was glued to it I was very,0.031977374
interested now does that mean that this is a perfect movie in every sense no,0.03663233
it's not there are a few things throughout this film that I thought could have,0.032699764
been explained more or expanded on I also didn't enjoy one storyline it's not that,0.019439327
it's bad but it has to do with this family on a yacht and I,0.05004376
understand why this storyline was in the film because you need a perspective from the,0.048601642
fishermen who are coming to save these soldiers but at the same time I guess,0.019651521
it was the weakest part of the film or at least the slowest part in,0.032602645
my opinion but as far as the overall tone and pacing of the film goes,0.032365177
I enjoyed it it felt like an adrenalin ride for an hour and 46 minutes,0.09264811
and also when you have Hans Zimmer's score playing throughout this film and you see,0.027194703
airplanes and bombs and people just trying to survive it feels like a ticking clock,0.18238072
counting down and you're just waiting for something bad to happen and it does over,0.0514912
and over and over and I might just say this is probably one of Christopher,0.023675881
Nolan's best looking films that he's ever directed and don't get me wrong I love,0.09452459
the Dark Knight I love Inception but from a visual standpoint I feel like this,0.028068755
movie does more than either one of those films did I'm really surprised I'm doing,0.03845892
this because going into this film I had reservations but I'm going to get the,0.043606114
film dunkirk Oh an A+ whoa an A+ I guess I really like that movie,0.121066086
I can't remember the last movie I gave an A+ for but as far as,0.012755562
this film goes it's not because I'm a Nolan fanboy that's not the reason I,0.061401106
loved it there was no blind love towards this movie going into it once again,0.044303227
I wasn't that excited to see the movie and the reason I gave this film,0.0588029
an A+ is this movie met every single expectation I wanted from a war film,0.06648311
and then went beyond those and surprised me with different elements of telling this story,0.023473665
that made it unique that made it original in many ways where it could have,0.021429555
been cliche and it could have played it safe but it took a chance it,0.01707726
did something new it took out all the filler all the fluff and it made,0.13590167
it about the event and it made you feel like you were part of it,0.023839517
alright guys that's my take on the film Dunkirk now here's my question to you,0.02658739
