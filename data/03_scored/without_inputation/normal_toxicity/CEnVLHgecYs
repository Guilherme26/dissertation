hello,0.054463096
everyone today,0.033936944
i'll be reviewing the third man,0.19299039
so the third man came out in 1949 and was directed by carol reid,0.11008652
and in this film we have joseph cotton,0.1811454
he played a man called holly martens and he's an american and he goes to visit vienna in order to see his friend harry lyme however when he gets there he discovers that harry lyme has been murdered under suspicious circumstances,0.37362012
so holly martin's he goes to see lots of different,0.06768765
people who are either at the scene of the crime or heard what happened,0.15787019
and he finds out that different,0.060820945
people seem to have different accounts of what happened,0.08861712
some people say a certain thing happens,0.08713702
some people say something else happens,0.098978184
and it turns out that there might be a mysterious third man who was involved in this crime,0.16850199
and in fact we don't actually know whether it was a murder or whether it was an accident,0.15948255
or how many people were involved or the circumstances and throughout this film we are following holly martin's as he tries to discover the truth about what happens to harry lyme and how in fact he died,0.09712517
now we also get a supporting cast in this film um,0.06819137
we get trevor howard he plays a character called major callaway who is essentially trying to also figure out what has happened to harry lyme,0.12616494
and he believes that harry ryan was involved in some suspicious activity himself which could have possibly led to his death and we also get um alida valley who plays a character called anna schmidt who was a woman who was at harry lam's funeral and he was very much in love with harry line and then we also get this story developed this romance angle between holly martens and anna schmidt as well although holly martens obviously really likes anna anna still cannot stop thinking about harry and how much she misses him,0.12904404
so this was the first time i'd ever seen this film so going into it,0.096724354
i didn't know exactly what to expect i knew this film was very well regarded,0.0871411
it's actually number one on the british film institute's greatest british films of all time,0.12352755
and it does have a very british film to it,0.08781579
although interestingly enough it's also listed on the american foot um on the american film institute's list of 100 greatest american movies in 1998. really the only american links to it are that awesome wales is in it and joseph cotton they're both american,0.07819903
and also the producer was david o'sellsnick who was american who produce many big hollywood films such as gone with the winds but really the director carol reed is british and it does have a very british feel to it,0.07138762
so i quite like that and what i really like about this film is the cinematography,0.06971815
and in fact this film actually only won one oscar which was for the cinematography because it's shot in gorgeous black and white and this this film is filled with loads of fantastic lighting effects really dark shadows and some tilted camera angles to give it a certain effect,0.07010685
and it really is such a beautiful film to look at this is one of the best looking black and white films i've ever seen it's one of those films that i cannot picture it being in color because if it was in color i really don't think it would work,0.106575094
the right way,0.053673625
what is also great about this film is the setting so it was shot entirely on location in vienna and remember this was 1949,0.11120427
so it was only a few years after the end of world war ii,0.1892531
and as such vienna looks a very desolate place,0.14486408
there's lots of places which have been bombed lots of buildings which look very dilapidated and looks quite run down,0.18801636
but when it's shot in this spectacular black and white with all these lighting and dark shadows really gives it a mysterious effect to it really adds to the tone of the film gives us a sense of intrigue and mystery which i really appreciated another thing that i have to mention in this film is the musical score,0.05361139
so the score for this film was done by anton carrass,0.604565
and he was completely new to the film going in this was a completely original score,0.029363038
so people didn't really know what to expect and the musical score to this it's so memorable,0.0664412
we always get this music playing throughout the film in certain situations,0.027159119
and after watching the film i had it stuck in my head for quite a while because it's such so such a memorable piece of music and it's very quirky and it's very unusual and it almost doesn't really go with the tone of the film because the music in this film it's very sort of light-hearted almost a bit silly and slapstick like sounding,0.41622823
it's a real contrast to what is happening in the film with obviously this murder and mystery angle that's going on for some reason it just works perfectly when it almost shouldn't really and it's this music really that gives the film a real modern feel to it,0.10948681
it's the sort of thing that they would do in lots of modern films now to just make it more appealing make it more interesting and going back to watch a film like this in 1949 that was doing this is really fantastic to see and it really makes the film seem very ahead of its time,0.035218857
now in terms of the story which is really,0.02815604
i suppose the main element of the film this is what really gripped me,0.065162525
i really loved the characters,0.06069952
and the film i loved the performances and just the story itself the constant interaction between these characters the conversations that they're having is really,0.035438474
what makes the film so interesting i was so interested in the plot in this film,0.08461185
i really like the plot we're constantly following holly martin's throughout this film and i really wanted to know what was happening as we unlock more and we understand and we use the audience understand more about what is going on,0.055497244
what has happened to harry lime,0.08564715
we really want to get a sense of understanding,0.07041921
and this film does a really good job of holding,0.056634676
my attention really wanting me to keep watching and make sure that i stay until the very end of the film so overall,0.09797592
i have to say the third man it's a brilliant fill noir,0.2403483
and it's one of the best british films of all time,0.16034864
as i said british film institute called it number one above films like the 39 steps and launch of arabia and i can certainly understand why it's a beautiful film fantastic musical score by anton carres a brilliant cast of actors and just overall a really lovely motion picture,0.06717987
so i'm going to give the third man a rating of 10 out of 10.,0.15665898
i really recommend that you see this film and if you're someone who is put off by watching films in black and white or films that are old,0.09831477
then please don't be put off by watching,0.14949848
this because it's an amazing film and it's one of those films that i think everybody should see i cannot rate this film highly enough,0.15483083
it's probably one of the greatest films that i've ever seen and i have seen so many great films so by all means please watch the third man,0.14105256
