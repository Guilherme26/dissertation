hello hello hello and welcome to another video and happy new year let's hope that,0.066223435
2021 is better than 2020 was today i'm going to be reviewing the costumes in,0.09393785
the film portrait of a lady on fire which is one of my favorite films,0.20366354
it's set in france in the 18th century so i feel like it's kind of,0.08949045
my wheelhouse and i've always wanted to do a costume review film like or costume,0.09064155
review video talking about the accuracy of the costumes and one of my favorite movies,0.1054349
so i think this is a good pick portrait of a lady on fire follows,0.25237167
two main characters heloise and marianne heloise's mother has hired marianne a painter to pretend,0.104480125
to be heloise's companion and paint her in secret because heloise has previously refused to,0.09188336
sit for a portrait artist and as they hang out together the two of them,0.19230814
fall in love the film also follows the also follows the storyline of the young,0.023052845
maid sophie but those are the three characters who are important to the film and,0.05186832
that's really all you need to know to understand the costumes of the film when,0.07283206
critiquing the costumes of this film i'm not going to be critiquing them from a,0.18501638
creative standpoint i'm not really an expert in costume design and the people who designed,0.097398676
these costumes are i'm mostly looking at this from an accuracy perspective what is accurate,0.12112245
what isn't and just to learn more about dress history so i guess without further,0.091869056
ado let's get to the costumes overall the costumes in this film are pretty good,0.099561274
first looking at the silhouettes first the silhouettes are pretty accurate to the mid-18th century,0.03030518
i think this film is supposed to be set in 1760 and all of the,0.09292006
characters have 1760s skirt shapes and bodice shapes one of the characters heloise i feel,0.10863969
like she could be wearing more um skirt supports or panties which widen the skirt,0.4741919
horizontally but i understand that maybe the reasoning behind that is that she's kind of,0.1546542
living in a rural area and she's just come from a convent so maybe she's,0.14995532
not wearing the most fashionable skirt supports but you can tell that all the characters,0.11901537
are wearing stays and you actually get to see the stays in several clips and,0.04980401
the stays that the characters are wearing look like historical stays they look like they,0.04479532
could be examples from museums there is one issue where the stays cross lace like,0.04410596
your tennis shoes might lace rather than doing spiral lacing which is almost like a,0.14398316
ladder and 18th century stays spiral laced but other than that the stays are super,0.07143558
accurate looking additionally the characters are all wearing shifts under their stays and the shift,0.059610866
is like a very basic t-shaped garment that people wore under their stays in the,0.14123279
18th century and it kind of absorbs sweat keeps your stays clean just keeps everything,0.08597322
nice and you can wash your shift much more easily than you could wash a,0.19655408
pair of stays and the characters are wearing shifts that look very similar to the,0.030042129
shifts that were worn in the mid-18th century and a lot of times historical films,0.05142326
forget to add shifts underneath corsets and stays which is just like that's really uncomfortable,0.15046762
i feel bad for the actresses who have to deal with that because it's super,0.1769092
uncomfortable to wear a pair of stays or a corset without something underneath to prevent,0.23842065
rubbing against your skin additionally the characters are all wearing petticoats and the pity coats,0.25504577
close at the sides which is how 18th century petticoats closed so that was pretty,0.09915242
good to see as well additionally several of the garments that are worn in this,0.057175536
film were inspired by museum examples that i can clearly identify the most the most,0.058328003
clear example of this is the cloak that eloise wears throughout the movie it is,0.059664354
like a cotton cloak and it's quilted and you can you can sometimes see like,0.24008928
the lining of her hood which has a different printed cotton lining and there is,0.13225445
a very similar cloak from the kyoto fashion institute which is i think a little,0.07059708
bit later in date it's from like the 1780s whereas this film is set in,0.113146976
the 1760s but other than that they're very similar in cut and construction and even,0.084699295
the trimming on the original coat and the coat in the film is really similar,0.07036141
so i thought that was an interesting uh call back to like the real historical,0.07840424
garments the character sophie the maid she's also dressed it looks very similar to the,0.1029104
portrait um the chocolate girl by jean etienne leotard i think that's his name and,0.49141654
she's wearing a cap and a little pinner apron and a little jacket and a,0.14502646
petticoat and it just looks pretty similar to that painting i also found a painting,0.057154514
from 1764 and it's an english painting but um she the one of the people,0.073616296
in that painting is wearing something very similar to what sophie is wearing in the,0.060240664
film so you can see that the costume designers were looking at images of maids,0.089506745
and female servants when they decided what sophie should wear lastly eloise's green dress which,0.17487504
is what she's painted in in the film is really reminiscent of several 18th century,0.06538084
green dresses that i can think of the most notably being one from the metropolitan,0.091328524
museum of art which is dated a little bit later than this film is set,0.10667057
but the color is very similar and there's one scene where sophie the maid is,0.08636148
carrying the dress and the dress definitely has more structure than most 18th century dresses,0.08267821
did despite like how structured they look on the body 18th century dresses themselves usually,0.1150152
don't have a lot of structure they might have a little bit of reed or,0.0909454
whale bone in them but not very much whereas when sophie's carrying it it looks,0.15624939
like the dress is like made partially of cardboard which is a little bit weird,0.3542518
but other than that the dress that dress specifically it looks like it could be,0.09660216
from the period this the seaming is correct the watto pleats which are the pleats,0.054862183
on the back of a sack backgown they look like original examples and even the,0.15073526
the sleeve seams um the sleeve seams are along the back of the arm which,0.08519484
is how a lot of 18th century sleeves were constructed another good thing that i,0.044230513
noticed about the costumes is that louise and marianne and sophie are all wearing neck,0.12382159
tuckers or little ruffles around their neckline as well as ruffles around the cuffs of,0.24105686
their dresses or jackets this is this was really common in the 18th century and,0.1159769
oftentimes in historical dramas they end up omitting this stylistic detail and it always ends,0.113158576
up looking a little bit off despite all of these great aspects of the film,0.08312762
of the costumes of the film there are a few things that are a little,0.04368187
bit off sad i'm sad to say for one looking at this film i would,0.2601067
have thought that it was set in maybe 1770 rather than 1760 or even 1775,0.07261842
because several of the characters namely heloise and her mother have closed front dresses and,0.21312945
i'm not 100 sure about jackets in the 1760s they might have had closed fronts,0.09736869
but most dresses in the 1760s had open fronts meaning that the front of the,0.07959395
dress there was kind of like a line here of what's called robin's and you,0.080947086
have a stomacher which is like basically a triangular piece of fabric that you can,0.15250276
switch out and heloise is casual dress as well as heloise's mother's jacket both of,0.1144167
them closed just straight down the front which is something you don't really see until,0.31089434
1775 but then again that's kind of pedantic and i think the the costume designers,0.35914817
were probably going for just an 18th century or mid to late 18th century look,0.05060262
rather than something very specifically 1760 but that was something that jumped out at me,0.10635032
when i was watching one aspect of the costuming of this film that really jumped,0.10120643
out at me as incorrect was the fact that heloise and marianne aren't wearing caps,0.078391366
sophie the maid is and so i imagine that the costume designers might have been,0.10202477
trying to use caps as code for domestic servant because there is one scene where,0.052031025
you see some of the people from the nearby village and a lot of them,0.09175513
are wearing caps so maybe more than domestic servant maybe caps is kind of code,0.06261045
for like working class characters but that wasn't really how it worked in the 18th,0.05358295
century pretty much everyone wore caps except on special occasions and like if you're going,0.109033644
to a ball or something caps weren't so much a thing for modesty as they,0.09070173
were for uh like keeping your hair clean and sometimes caps could even be born,0.23994729
to demonstrate like your wealth because fancier caps demonstrate that you are you can afford,0.10687754
a fancier cap and therefore you're a wealthier member of society and so it's just,0.22844931
a little bit jarring to see sophie and louise not wearing caps another thing that,0.10418607
was kind of odd was the fact that throughout the film their hair is just,0.05482531
in low buns which makes sense because which makes sense in some way because that's,0.18181816
kind of how you would wear your hair under a basic cap like if you're,0.1685111
if you're just putting on a basic cap to keep your hair clean you're not,0.2795617
going to do a fancy hairstyle but because neither of them are wearing caps you,0.1642067
might expect them to have a fancier hairstyle to show off but their hair is,0.101715416
just in buns and this is less jarring in the 1760s when the hairstyles were,0.15843363
not so high but there's a scene set a little bit later i think in,0.15079847
the 1780s and heloise still has the exact same bun in her hair and it's,0.21230571
just a little bit odd because like she's at the opera or no she's at,0.18864127
the orchestra and her hair is just in a little bun at the back of,0.23059884
her head which is not how it would have been worn she probably should have,0.16934876
had taller hair or some sort of hedgehog hair or something taller the last thing,0.18688591
that i thought was really weird about the costumes were the like sheer bits of,0.18359484
cloth that heloise and marianne wore around their faces when they went to the beach,0.11157107
when it was windy i looked this up and i thought oh maybe it's like,0.07548134
a coastal french fashion from the 18th century but according to an article i read,0.06961969
that was interviewing the costume designer this was actually a modern choice just to lend,0.06285617
like eroticism to the film with like the covered mouths and then it was on,0.109121375
the beach that the the two characters eventually kiss and so having the like thin,0.10029968
fabric covering their mouths is supposed to kind of lend to the suspense of that,0.1296689
scene which i guess makes sense but it was it was a little bit jarring,0.15126078
historically it didn't really make sense in the context of the 18th century another thing,0.040716372
about those masks that i thought was funny just in the context of 2020 and,0.06655341
i guess now 2021 is marianne's mask is below her nose and i saw that,0.40317822
and i was like oh no marianne you're not you're not wearing your covet mask,0.4031429
properly it's got to cover your nose and your mouth and then i realized that,0.8071076
this is set in 1760 and coven 19 masks are not a thing but that's,0.08632458
that's definitely my modern take on this one last thing that i thought was really,0.07435075
funny is i found a quote from one of the costume designers about 18th century,0.051478755
stays and i think from watching historical films those of us who like watching historical,0.1422556
films for their costumes we're all kind of used to the stays and corsets are,0.11941902
bad for you joe so this quote was just really funny in that context the,0.24026266
designer said during that era women's bodies were confined to clothing stiffened with whale bone,0.3418173
which greatly restricted their movements including breathing which is really funny because there are shots,0.16516799
of the characters running there are shots of one of the characters marianne lifting a,0.05331644
heavy box and you can see like she's moving her arms like she's lifting a,0.1568354
big box she's she's bending over like the 18th century stays that the characters are,0.101405434
wearing aren't restricting their movements so i don't understand why the designer thought that maybe,0.07122619
the actresses didn't like wearing stays and stays there's it feels different than wearing like,0.053901482
a modern bra but they're not restrictive i've worn stays all day at events and,0.08236458
it's no different than wearing a bra in terms of like how restricted you feel,0.12908788
it's just a little bit different so i thought that was pretty funny stays are,0.10501468
not torture devices everyone psa overall as a viewer this film is also just something,0.07401197
that i really enjoy it's good to see the stories of queer women in the,0.40334573
past being told queer people existed and have existed throughout history i can think of,0.109534435
like the ladies of langolin as another example of queer women in this period and,0.10508983
so that's really cool and then the film is just entertaining and beautiful to watch,0.07824259
and it's just a good film i really enjoyed it so if you want to,0.09045622
distract yourself and spend a little bit of time bringing in the new year with,0.115122266
a good film i highly recommend portrait of a lady on fire we'll be back,0.32432696
in the next couple weeks with another with more sewing content and so i hope,0.06478181
until then have a good day have a good week thank you to you for,0.055200808
watching thank you to ali for their help filming and editing this video and i,0.15262322
hope that you have a happy new year hello hello hello and happy new year,0.08855591
