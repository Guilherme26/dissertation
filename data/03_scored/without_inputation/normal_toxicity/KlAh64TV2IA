what's up guys it's Katie,0.10390801
and as some of you know I teamed up with comic cave Studios and they sent me to the thor ragnarok premiere a few weeks ago and if you happen to miss out on that video you can just click the card right on up here and check it out but ever since the premiere I have been dying to review the movie for you guys,0.14931001
and now the time has come and I'm so excited so let's get to it and don't worry guys absolutely no spoilers all right,0.16475739
so I'm just gonna start off with a big statement,0.10079545
this was probably one of my favorite Marvel movies and it's definitely the funniest honestly the opening scene in this film completely sets up the movie for exactly what you're gonna get which is awesome,0.09644728
sometimes you go into a movie the opening scene is fabulous,0.18195672
and then the whole rest of the movie you're like wait wait,0.11681407
but there's so much action in this opening scene and there's none throughout the rest of the movie no the the vibe,0.08105938
and the hilarity that you get in the beginning scene of this movie literally translates throughout the entire film and I absolutely loved that,0.067315646
thor ragnarok is the third installment of the thor series and the millionth installment of marvel movies but I gotta say sometimes you can get to that third movie and it's like they've run out of ideas and you're just like ah this isn't as good as some of the previous ones,0.08301684
no this is I don't even I don't know if it's my favorite,0.11851112
Thor movie because I really loved the second Thor movie but it definitely is up there Chris Hemsworth as usual is the most incredible,0.0569257
Thor he's hilarious in this film as well as strong and heroic which was really nice and can get a little boring sometimes when you have a lead hero that's just like I'm a hero,0.15057848
all I do is hero a hero there and a hero there and a hero everywhere but Thor he is a charming and hilarious hero all right,0.08671609
he's got more to him than just saving the world,0.073867865
and I love that about him,0.08029215
now we do have some new characters joining us in this film which I'm not gonna say names in case it's a spoiler but I will say Tessa Thompson plays a new character in this movie and she's phenomenal absolutely phenomenal,0.077816226
I want her character to have her own movie,0.15435477
now there was a moment in the film where I saw what her own movie might look like,0.08110838
and I was like oh my gosh can we please make this happen,0.21002719
SIF never got a movie in fact whatever happened to SIF who knows she's not in the film which is a bummer because I love SIF but we do have Tessa Thompson's character and she's awesome,0.15786348
she had some moments in the film that totally stole the show and she was just she was just such a cool character,0.18157327
I loved I loved her character,0.09189691
and I thought that she worked really well alongside Thor and some of the other characters that you know I don't want to give away too much,0.07504113
but I just got to say I was so pleasantly surprised because I had no idea I was like oh this character could either be really cool,0.040881056
or she could just not be great,0.31089434
and I really liked her and I want more of her character I would love for her character to have her own movie especially like an origin story of her character I think that would just be so amazing,0.09071204
if you've seen the trailers which I'm sure you have because they're everywhere we do have Thor going up against Hulk in like the ultimate gladiator battle in this film,0.111239314
and I have to say it is hilarious,0.114043236
but it's not just hilarious it is action-packed and intense at the same time this whole movie kind of felt like that they did such a good job keeping the film funny light-hearted but also didn't lack any action or or drama like they did such a good job at merging,0.06278338
both of those things which is what I love the most about the film we do get a new villain in Thor Ragnarok Kate Blanchet plays hella who is our villain and she's awesome,0.24234122
I thought Cate Blanchett did a great job,0.063755624
so with the comedy and the humor of this film being one of my favorite parts,0.15009187
I can understand that there are probably gonna be some people out there that think that there isn't enough drama in this movie,0.092836194
and maybe think that the humor or the comedy overshadows the drama of the film and that's a very fair opinion,0.095476694
okay it wasn't dark and gritty and super dramatic but it was fun and action-packed,0.15397811
I still think it had some drama it just wasn't maybe as drama heavy as say the first Thor movie but that's what I liked about this one,0.09651781
I do have to say there is one thing in this movie that I really really really didn't like,0.06889877
and it has nothing to do with the movie it's just that I don't like Chris Hemsworth gets his hair cut in the film no he doesn't have his long hair uh I'm so mad,0.25742438
I mean we all know it because it's in the trailer but I was I was not happy,0.070481256
I was like no,0.08867949
he has to have his lung beautiful hair,0.14295326
okay it's Thor but seriously the entire cast of this film was just fantastic,0.10010858
I mean Tom Hiddleston we have Karl Urban who I love Karl Urban Jeff Goldblum Ã¦gis Elba all fantastic in this film there wasn't one person in this movie that I was like uh just go away I seriously liked everyone all the new characters all of the characters that we know and love already from the Marvel Cinematic Universe,0.095469005
they're all there overall,0.062353283
I loved this movie I'm gonna go see it again,0.09284201
that's how much I liked it,0.055004716
it was just fun and funny and action-packed it had drama where drama needed to be but I like that they kept it light and still told a great story and introduced new characters and just made me want more I'm already ready for another Thor movie like,0.0471535
