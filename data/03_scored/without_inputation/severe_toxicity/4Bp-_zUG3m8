hello everybody my name is Brandon Nikita Brando critic and today we will be discussing,0.049873475
a star is born yes I know it is rather late this movie came out,0.034346092
quite a few months ago life got in the way here we go so I,0.054880977
just want to state rap the bat that I have not seen any other versions,0.043208335
of this movie I haven't seen the movie in the 50s I haven't seen the,0.020225573
movie from the 70s the 2018 version is the only version I've ever seen so,0.020322692
we have Bradley Cooper and Lady gaga going on this musical adventure together Bradley Cooper,0.12373147
is Jack this really famous country slash rock singer and his career is kind of,0.029616637
waning down because he is an alcoholic a drug addict and his life and his,0.44095945
music and his career is just devoid of passion at this point and he's just,0.07336244
going towards drugs and alcohol to try to fill that void until Ali comes along,0.057968758
played by Lady gaga and she's just singing in some random bar Bradley Cooper's Jack,0.1430983
sees her and then he starts to get some passion again in his life and,0.05730956
passion in his music and of course they fall in love and a star is,0.061661195
born so a lot of my friends that have seen this movie they really love,0.043312103
it they say Brandon you got to see this I can't with you've waited this,0.046031374
long to go see it I know life has gotten in the way but for,0.01836705
me it's funny how a person's love for a movie really works because I can,0.040507022
go through each aspect of filmmaking in this movie the directing screenwriting cinematography editing sound,0.06188935
design the songs I'll talk about the songs and I can say that Bradley Cooper,0.025289617
and the filmmaking team did a great job at every aspect of the filmmaking process,0.025290282
but I can't say that I love this movie when you say that you love,0.022350837
a movie it's that unexplainable gut feeling that this film has impacted you in a,0.04873468
way that no other film has and you'll remember it forever that's why you love,0.021307828
a movie a star is born I will remember it for quite a long time,0.032793555
because this movie is emotionally heavy it's not such a light-hearted movie that you can,0.05525215
just walk in smile and leave and though that was a nice movie no it,0.060170516
does make you think it makes you really feel because this movie is powerful but,0.024550598
I don't know if I love it that's a whole other category but since this,0.022286978
movie is really good and it's really well made you might love it cuz I,0.06898886
know a lot of people do that doesn't mean that there's no scenes in the,0.016931584
movie that I love there are definitely some moments that I did tear up in,0.034058068
this movie guys it is rare for me to do that but the songs oh,0.08883062
my god when Lady Gaga performed that song I started to tear up it was,0.0769398
wonderful and you can see her when she's singing the song that she's playing this,0.04449347
character who's this lowlife I may be not low life but this unfamous person just,0.25315806
trying to make her way in the world she works for a shitty job and,0.66100365
she's just doing these gigs of these drag bars she wants her voice to be,0.15659088
heard and then as soon as she sings her song that she wrote and she,0.03310087
kind of does the oh my god I can't leave this is happening but she,0.023778984
keeps singing it's it's powerful stuff and Bradley Cooper's a good director for bringing that,0.026357237
out because a director's main job is to get the best possible performance out of,0.025324872
his actors or her actors whoever is directing the movie but Bradley Cooper man he,0.1040294
knows how to direct a movie because those emotional scenes especially when Lady Gaga is,0.041156907
singing her song that she wrote in front of him all these people she starts,0.04345046
to just oh my god I can't believe it and that is great acting great,0.03632967
directing and great chemistry between the two of them and that's another reason why I,0.026359232
really enjoyed this movie was because of the chemistry between Bradley Cooper's Jack and Lady,0.05786765
Gaga's Ally you know I've seen Lady Gaga perform all throughout my high school days,0.028333498
because that's when she got popular with Just Dance pokerface and I've seen her sing,0.036245856
at the Oscars so I didn't see her as just like this party girl I,0.08674727
saw her as this elegant singer who can sing like the really powerful music but,0.027631063
now after seeing this I know that she can act as well I mean Lady,0.13869745
Gaga is now becoming one of my favorite performers and I have so much more,0.017044
respect for her because she can sing the pop songs she can sing the really,0.040397268
classical tunes and then she can also act in this movie and her chemistry with,0.02361535
Bradley Cooper is unprecedented because you really feel like these characters are in love you,0.030943679
don't actually see Lady gaga and Bradley Cooper acting you see Jack and Hallie fall,0.11065995
in love and you go through all the relationship problems that they go through and,0.0715884
it feels real it really does feel real and even when the movie was going,0.025262345
on and there was some slower parts I did feel my attention span start to,0.03546094
Griese and i was starting to think about other things like okay what am I,0.22532426
gonna do after the movie I'm kind of hungry I want to go to Montana's,0.05021471
but they just closed it down you know thinking of things that don't really matter,0.025024874
in the movie but what brought me back into it was Lady Gaga and Bradley,0.09269533
Cooper's connection with each other their chemistry and that is what really sells this movie,0.025384739
and when they sing together they're singing chemistry and the songs they elevate that chemistry,0.024526652
even more so those were the best parts of the movie and lastly I also,0.046183035
like that this film brought up the topic of fame and fortune and how it's,0.035935216
not always so glamorous you know you see these stars on TV and you think,0.024003152
oh my god I wish I could be just like them you know we look,0.037136536
up at celebrities and I mean I'm very fortunate enough that I have a roof,0.029067194
over my head and I have a good family but you know you can't help,0.044427615
but look at those celebrities and think oh my god I'd be amazing to have,0.028915534
a house like this and to have a career like this and have everyone idolize,0.033488005
you and you know it's the grass is always greener on the other side right,0.06317515
you can take a look at a celebrity and you say oh my god I,0.03071685
wish I could be just like them but then you start to realize that yes,0.0547659
being a celebrity has a lot of perks yes you generally get paid a lot,0.04027687
more you have a lot of fans and you get to do what you love,0.017775703
singing acting being an athlete who knows but then as well it becomes a whole,0.04432917
other set of issues comes with it right you may not have the same issues,0.03823143
that you have right now just being a normal everyday person but then you have,0.03823143
different problems with different perks so it's a catch-22 yes you would like to be,0.07774401
famous but you still have a whole other issue and a whole lot of other,0.029479608
problems that go with it and you see it in this movie you know as,0.0509677
soon as Lady Gaga's Ally becomes famous you know as soon as the star is,0.033026367
born then it becomes a whole their issue right she wanted to become a singer,0.061725717
thought she could share her voice and share her passion for music which she does,0.1339314
but then you know when her agents like will you need to this image right,0.04371587
we need to make you a brand a product to sell to customers so she's,0.039964233
not just a singer she's a li she needs to have her look she needs,0.060557652
to have her dance she needs to have her type of persona Michael Jackson didn't,0.040312126
just sing he sold his look his dance numbers his music videos is brand right,0.10362697
as soon as you get that big you become a brand not just a person,0.05710402
and you might think that people are manipulating you into being a certain way to,0.08760203
get more money but that's the life right and then of course it brings jealousy,0.049630016
upon relationships because I will never know what it's like to date a famous person,0.12138204
I mean I've never seen ever but as as at this point right now my,0.029977832
life I've never dated anyone famous and I will never know what it is like,0.033418827
to date a famous person or to date someone as a famous person right so,0.054561023
you can only see this movie and think it brings a whole other set of,0.035391763
challenges yes you would like to be famous and you'd like to meet all these,0.07171345
new people and have a lot of people idolize you but then again relationships and,0.027379625
dating having a family your career it's a whole other set of issues that you,0.046965957
have to deal with and I like that this film brought that into its story,0.03907688
and actually became a big part of the story and no spoilers but I knew,0.01647793
how this movie was gonna end right from the beginning there is a little bit,0.14029655
of early foreshadowing in this movie and I saw it right away and I said,0.05476324
okay well that's gonna happen but every single person I've talked to didn't notice it,0.03421705
and this is not people on the internet it's not people on YouTube or Instagram,0.10067155
it's just people that I know personally and they say oh I didn't see that,0.021207385
in the beginning how did you know that that was gonna happen so if you,0.026485616
spot it you can kind of guess where it's gonna go but if you don't,0.036265813
notice it then that's movie will take you on a loop so all in all,0.03557136
I'll give a star is born' a four out of five because again it's one,0.040454473
of those movies where I can look down every single aspect of the filmmaking and,0.05429894
say okay Bradley Cooper knows how to make a good movie and he delivers an,0.047909185
emotionally impactful one a really strong movie did it impact me in a way that,0.05160495
I can see that I love it like a Bohemian Rhapsody did it didn't but,0.04638791
that's the beauty of movies it impacts people differently so I can clearly say that,0.028333498
a star is born is a great movie and I do recommend it to everyone,0.042071536
out there because although I might not love it it might impact you in a,0.07652406
way to say that you of it or it might be your favorite movie ever,0.03224611
it's a good movie let's check it out for yourself so anyways guys thank you,0.07695909
