and grand ending and afterlife they'll have by serving human,0.4315695
I mean its ideology that's straight out of Stalinism and like dictatorship megalomania at its best for me the movie was just a hell of a ride and and visual experience that was just really exciting and beautiful to watch on screen no times I really feel the danger I don't think that it really gripped me on a deeper level,0.1967079
