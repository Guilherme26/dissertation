comedy today called book smart it's the directorial debut of Olivia Wilde two stars Kaitlyn,0.058273412
Dever and beanie Feldstein the story follows two high school friends that have spent the,0.014521624
last four years relentlessly hitting the books while others were going to parties and seemingly,0.124200426
working much less than they were in realizing that they could have potentially missed out,0.031066736
on some of the fun that their peers have been having over the last four,0.04090414
years the two of them tried to catch up on all of it by having,0.061715737
one wild and memorable night of partying on the eve of their graduation no I'm,0.054813795
not gonna lie to you from what the trailer showed me of this one I've,0.069437854
appeared to be another rather formulaic high school comedy with some strong emotional undertones to,0.03031774
it it did look like it has some potential though because the trailers made me,0.046163745
laugh and despite being many many years out of high school I was actually interested,0.026498256
in what this cast could deliver and much more so what Olivia Wilde could pull,0.04916572
off from behind the camera and I think much to my delight this film delivered,0.036878448
much more than a simple teenage story of growth into the adult world that was,0.040715892
a heartwarming coming-of-age story but it also just blended in a charming sense of humor,0.032837454
with everything with some sincere emotional arcs and a great musical score that routinely was,0.016827816
able to pump a lot of energy into the atmosphere of the narrative on top,0.04929277
of all that it was a successful female buddy comedy that I thought thrived from,0.06650706
the performances of devaron Feldstein the script was extremely well written but it was the,0.027991593
delivery of the material and the chemistry between these actresses that I thought created genuine,0.045524504
characters I felt were just impossible not to connect with they captured that pure friendship,0.028876288
with ease and it resulted in some effective laughs that had me thinking back to,0.026357237
my high school days I was able to just really see myself inside of these,0.04696529
characters within a few minutes of their screen time their routine and going to school,0.035822134
was much different than my best friend and what we had the music may have,0.009840062
been different as well but the dynamic we had it was very much our own,0.018409623
like it was for these two girls and it had me completely invested in just,0.053098284
the authenticity of everything the script weaves solid arcs for both characters individually but it,0.0160123
also showed a strong focus on the growth of their friendship overall which is this,0.020685216
what really had me completely engaged in where this story is gonna take not only,0.036990196
them but their friendship I mean this film honestly does have a collection of scenes,0.07205136
that felt very familiar to a lot of other movies in the genre yet I,0.012472859
have to say with devaron Feldstein creating such extremely likeable characters it was still very,0.041676417
much intriguing to see them progress through these scenes regardless I think the writing was,0.041632514
really able to just hit all the emotional beats with near perfect timing when it,0.18048628
needed to be lighting comical about the situations and the dialogue delivered and when it,0.018723588
needed to be serious and more dramatic the turn felt very natural and smooth as,0.06497979
the story arcs in the various character and relationship dynamics took over and everything complemented,0.0070130313
each other very well I thought it was also able to feel very comfortable and,0.03712656
capable in a realistically crass high school setting without ever losing its sincerity there certainly,0.056171432
are some crude situations and some jokes that earn this movie it's our rating however,0.015261973
they never felt placed in to simply be raunchy for Raji's sake I mean things,0.060027502
are gonna get vulgar and stories centering around teenagers because at that age we often,0.06821991
were I mean unless I went to the wrong high school sex parties drugs and,0.36749738
alcohol are all things that many teenagers are exposed to and this story really captured,0.007479325
those elements with that realistic approach that kept it from just simply feeling like shock,0.039450713
value humor it really complimented that comedic tone by exploring other social elements that teenagers,0.04126267
must go through which gave everything much more heart I think Olivia Wilde's direction was,0.067729
skillful in her debut it's clear to me that she understood the tone and the,0.06050311
intention of this story about she did a great job of manoeuvring the characters to,0.033227254
capture the right emotion and level of intensity during many different scenes I really thought,0.022153942
she let the performances shine by just holding the frame of the shop or longer,0.05352733
periods during the more emotionally driven scenes and then as the night progresses in the,0.037232324
level of craziness elevates I think Wilde really infused it with a vibrant and crisp,0.24788892
artistic style and overall what she did was subtle but she accomplished things behind the,0.058695804
lens that just blended smoothly with the tone of the story when the narrative was,0.014095241
calm camera techniques felt much more simplistic and then as drugs and alcohol and action,0.0980933
makes its way in the story I thought wild was really able to switch up,0.019528462
the techniques and the angles to just show a skillful eye in creating her vision,0.038158923
for this story another strong positive for me with this one was the supporting cast,0.027610444
I thought there were a variety of side characters throughout the storylines who just continually,0.01559124
keep things feeling fresh in terms of personality types and angles of humor and jason,0.03710328
sudeikis lisa kudrow and Will Forte all provide some charm in small doses with a,0.10214028
collection of younger characters as well like Skylar ghazan doe Billie lourd and Noah Gavin,0.079563946
all bringing some life to some otherwise routine character types that I thought were all,0.048055526
able at different times to provide some laughs everything in this movie to me just,0.04478615
felt right nothing really took over the focus of being on these two friends and,0.024015125
all the other elements felt like just perfect side dishes to everything it's very heartwarming,0.026917322
without feeling sappy and it's because nothing just felt overly forced so overall I really,0.09084613
enjoyed this movie and I'm surprisingly enough gonna have to give book-smart 90% on the,0.044810098
entertainment meter drawbacks in this movie would be minor like I said I haven't been,0.03487691
to high school in a long time so I couldn't tell you how realistic or,0.055607356
unrealistic some of the character types in this movie were but for the needs of,0.016278375
the story I thought they all worked for providing a variety of different personalities I,0.013310324
mean the movie does follow some genre tropes the progression of the plotline is one,0.020836879
that you can sort of forecast and some of the humor does not hit with,0.01816284
the intended impact but I don't think any comedy is gonna go out there and,0.034060065
deliver a perfect string of laughs so in this instance I think much much more,0.14173667
of the humor work than what didn't so when all that was paired with the,0.01048529
more dramatic elements of the story the result was honestly just an endearing coming-of-age movie,0.054889623
with two lead characters that felt very genuine and down-to-earth that can make this genre,0.015893232
film appeal to a mass audience thank you guys so much for watching this video,0.06693211
