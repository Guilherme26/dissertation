shape of water with Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer I have the pleasure of watching,0.035143647
this movie at the Dubai International Film Festival as one of the 13 films that,0.027843922
I watched there so I'm slowly going through the lists as they're being released in,0.018714942
the UAE this one in particular has taken some time being released in the UAE,0.023895392
because of censorship issues I'm not quite sure if this is one that you actually,0.045862418
want to go to the cinema here to watch I am interested to go and,0.019537108
see it here to see how it has been edited because I heard because there,0.027464103
is nudity that there's been some sort of cover-up made for Sally Hawkins character and,0.09731637
I'm sure that certain activities that she was involved in will also have been concocted,0.035415042
sure ah the story is that ELISA Esposito is a mute janitor she can't speak,0.15208293
because of this accident that she had when she was a child and she works,0.19374073
at a research facility the scientists at this research facility have discovered this reptilian frog,0.17888518
like sort of creature and they're holding him in one of the labs and they,0.06016586
want to use him as a part of space exploration and send him up into,0.09155255
space and it's somehow some sort of race between them and the Russians in the,0.20990868
process of cleaning the facilities she starts to interact with this creature and they develop,0.11135041
a really cute relationship especially around hard-boiled eggs and this lady really has a thing,0.18293747
with hard-boiled eggs and really maximizes her time that is used during the making of,0.06841613
hard-boiled eggs I thought that Sally Hawkins did a really great job in this film,0.13463981
however for myself I did find it really difficult seeing her naked and seeing her,0.51659775
go through part of her borning routine especially during the cooking of her hard-boiled eggs,0.22715664
if you know what I'm saying if you've seen the film you know what she's,0.03208979
doing anyway so I couldn't find it difficult because Sally Hawkins plays mrs. Brown in,0.031971388
the Paddington movies and I kept wanting to like yell at the screen dang like,0.039284416
how long does it take to hard boil an egg I think it's only like,0.25271723
15 minutes but wow she uses that time personally let's just say she's like feeding,0.12235588
him these eggs and they have this relationship because he doesn't speak either he's this,0.08363487
reptile creature and and she can't speak if their relationship develops in this non verbal,0.14631513
way but it was really cute and simple and deep and very sweet and there's,0.031943448
just this acceptance he's not accepted for who he is and he's definitely being mistreated,0.036236543
she also is not accepted by a lot of people or society at large and,0.06603411
fields rather marginalized because she can't speak so they have this deep relationship I really,0.13307731
really liked the beginning half of this film I just thought it was beautifully made,0.031461857
I loved the development of their relationship I loved the development of all of her,0.09778399
other relationships and just the development of ELISA Esposito's character itself however the last half,0.021949064
of this film completely lost me like once she got him out of the facility,0.09819907
and then they started developing this more intimate relationship between the two of them I,0.088283174
don't know it just got weird and I felt like the deeper themes that could,0.021645742
have actually been really drawn out a lot more clearly and with a lot more,0.04606929
care I felt were a bit rushed like the ending and understanding how her injury,0.105268635
plays into the carrying on of their relationship I just felt like it didn't end,0.03561859
in a way that really brought a lot of substance to that theme it was,0.017540228
there but I felt it was a bit rushed and it was a bit I,0.0966146
just felt like it got a bit weird and I felt like the story got,0.072255574
lost in that I just didn't have the same feeling in the last half of,0.020256838
the film that I had in the first half of the film that can understand,0.02434306
why this film got the best picture at the Oscars because it's very artistic and,0.03377869
if you look at it that way it is a very beautiful film but I,0.023165686
just feel like the last part just really as a as a cinema goer and,0.022630878
a fan of film and a lover of stories and I just felt like the,0.020283446
last half of the film just kind of lost it for me again this film,0.054596942
B+ because I did like the artistry I loved the music I loved the color,0.06344588
palette I really did like the development of her character but then it sort of,0.036690865
fell flat at the end so it lost marks there it is entertaining but entertaining,0.027011111
in an artistic sort of way give this video a big thumbs up if you,0.10136733
