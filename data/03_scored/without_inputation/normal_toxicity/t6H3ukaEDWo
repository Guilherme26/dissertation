hey everybody today,0.05170371
I'm going to be reviewing Mad Max fury road and I know I'm so late hun reviewing this I know everyone's already seen it,0.12989025
but I kept getting request after request,0.03971538
after request to review this movie,0.06469173
so here,0.058199726
I am I'm devoted one of the reasons it took me so long to actually go see the movies because I was a complete Mad Max virgin I we hadn't even made it to first base,0.37296176
I knew nothing about Mad Max I didn't even know Mel Gibson was in it,0.22223896
and I know that's kind of lame to admit,0.52989787
but I just I didn't really grow up with a lot of cult action movies as a kid,0.07996348
so I just never got introduced to it,0.10425967
and you know what's so great about this movie is that you don't have to have much backstory at all if any to enjoy it,0.124593265
and I think a lot of that comes from the simplicity of the storyline the movie is just kind of one big climax that is stripped to the bare-bones in terms of the plot,0.07201372
you've,
got your protagonist which is max obviously and he is a prisoner,0.3318128
that is escaping from this tyrannical civilization that it's kind of like a cross between Tatooine and Geonosis,0.20493504
he is escaped and he is helped by a woman named furiosa played by Charlize Theron and the whole movie is basically just them trying to survive and they're being chased,0.14542271
that's it,0.05140533
some may say that the plot is too simplistic,0.16386458
and I couldn't disagree more I actually think ironically it's very refreshing to see a movie an action movie know exactly what it is,0.052460548
and so it just keeps everything to the minimum in terms of how complicated the plot is because I feel like nowadays all I see and I'm getting so sick of it are these overly complicated plots and these movies these action movies that have so much CGI no personality at all they're just like,0.15074909
these cold corporate things that are just kind of shoved out on an assembly line and this movie basically just Christ Faolain all that Mad Max is a no-holds-barred blockbuster flick and it's gritty,0.31089434
it's relentless it's bombastic and all of this in the best possible way,0.0964586
and it's one of the best action movies,0.0518768
I've seen a long long time I watched some of the making of behind the scenes footage and from what I understand there's very little CGI going on here,0.07568399
and that is so great because to me you just can't I mean at least right now I mean maybe in the future we will be able to be more evolved in terms of the technology,0.101626985
but right,0.045029547
now you just can't capture the personality and the detail of things with a computer everything here just looks so real and authentic the atmosphere of it is incredible so creative,0.084638745
they look like they put so much effort into everything everything from the cars to the makeup and the weapons everything it's just so over the top and it you feel like you while you're watching it,0.107950754
you feel like you're at the most adrenaline infused operatic rock concert ever,0.099786125
and actually there is even a guy who is you know,0.11321898
on top of one of the vehicles with a guitar electric guitar and there's fire coming out of it,0.11689416
and he's just like,0.0753333
and as soon as I saw that I was just like yes by that point you know exactly what kind of movie it is and you just kind of have to go in headfirst,0.17182356
and I think that the cacophonous nature of the visual storytelling is balanced,0.07669326
so well with what I said before that simple story,0.064405106
that's more kind of in the revenge Kill Bill style and each character has something that is at stake or desires something that we can all connect to emotionally,0.22094953
you mean you've got max who's just trying to escape,0.103199854
and he's got all of this,0.093359336
you know post-traumatic stress,0.14358686
I guess you could say he's just basically wanting to be liberated from this oppressive society and then you got Nicholas Hoult character who is quite manic and naive and he just wants to stand for something he wants his life to have meaning before he dies and in there's furiosa who is one of the female characters Charlize Theron,0.49339038
and this character has been talked about a lot I think more than any other aspect of the movie and actually somebody on YouTube asked me what I thought about the if I thought it was feminist or or what I think the movie is feminist,0.31089434
but really I don't think it's consciously,0.0763917
I think it's just a movie that has happens to have very strong female characters it,0.17686461
and it's one of the very few films to portray a female in a very realistic light as as realistic as Mad Max could be,0.24813814
and it is not feminist propaganda like some people think it is,0.31611308
and because it's capturing all kinds of different archetypes,0.061066557
and how females are portrayed in different ways,0.3460265
furiosa is just one of the most badass female action heroes,0.34517682
I've ever seen,0.08705411
I mean she's tough and very androgynous she's got a shaved head that's kind of been that Maria Falcon Eddie style and if you get that reference there aren't any moments at least that I remember watching the movie where she was once objectified where they even referred to her as a female,0.1453413
there isn't any competition or you know sexual tension that you usually see in these kinds of action movies and Max and period as equals and I guess the feminist aspect of the movie that we are all,0.31089434
seeing is that furiosa is trying to free all of these sex,0.6756304
slaves basically there are these female slaves that have this captor and the slave women even though they may be scantily clad and they may not have the prowess of curiosa,0.5724331
they do have their own kind of resourceful qualities,0.25582713
so the movie is showing us different facets to masculinity and femininity like on one hand George Miller the director is trying to show us women who are able to prevail in a masculine environment,0.24143097
and then other times I don't want to give it away,0.10907157
and I want to give away spoilers but other women do fall victim to it,0.5371852
and he's also showing us the pros and cons to an overtly masculine world yes there may be a lot of very gruff masculine villains in the movie but yet you do have a very mess man at the forefront of the film max,0.17833415
so the whole thing is very rounded it builds with tension in a way that is very exciting,0.08955943
and it's got an amazing flow to it,0.060590986
it's got an accessible storyline as I said that people can latch on to and even though the plot is very similar to things that we see we've seen in the past,0.050444514
it doesn't have any of those action cliches that we're so used to like the catch phrases and things like that it's so raw and entertaining and yet it feels like it was made by human hands which unfortunately is rare in this day and age to me it has all the makings of a classic,0.13861766
so yeah it's just as good as everybody is saying it is,0.07076887
so that is my review,0.078698695
