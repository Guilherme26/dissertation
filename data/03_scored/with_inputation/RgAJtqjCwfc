I watched it I'll make a review no post it and see what other people,0.1082848
think and let you guys see what the booby is before you guys see the,0.3939194
movie so I'm just going to read off my written review the movie Selma was,0.063305944
placed in rural Alabama during the 1960s during this time black people in the south,0.016841747
for fighting for their voting rights the legendary martin luther king jr. brilliantly played by,0.06655457
david on Lulu came to settlement with his members of Southern Christian Leadership Conference to,0.104595214
connect with the grassroot black activists already in summer to lead the nonviolent demonstrations throughout,0.2922782
the city during these demonstrations director Ava de Luna was able to depict the several,0.10108431
violent acts that were committed against the peaceful protesters by the city officials being you,0.40326223
know the officers on the governor letting them do these things crazy the violence against,0.34430066
the protesters recreated on film and connected the viewer to the struggles that the black,0.026752636
people of the 1960s went through fighting for their voting rights it also showed how,0.10327043
heartless the white people in the South once were screenwriter Paul web grabs the attention,0.5601575
of the viewers by creating a personal dialogue between dr. King president LBJ at the,0.08164467
time and his wife Coretta and also they show personal conversations with his group members,0.100982904
of the sels see these conversations allow the viewers to see a different side of,0.03559055
King allowing us to connect with King struggle and the movement do it all this,0.07038406
was a great movie ok that's the written review now this is my personal opinion,0.07794176
about the movie now Selma was a recreated event this happened you know in the,0.055537507
ninth in around March bloody sunday was a March March something 1965 let's say in,0.51760954
1965 right now we're in 2015 this is almost 50 years ago that this event,0.04432675
happened now um being a heartful film and being um actually produced by oprah his,0.09982682
production company and i was thinking the other day like Harpo is crazy cousin color,0.4546338
purple I think hella purple every time I think Harpo or I think of Oprah,0.1561074
so harpal was I think Danny Glover played by danny glover and he was raping,0.7272729
you know whoopee and stuff and I mean that's what I think besides that um,0.14584896
the the creating budget for this film was 20 million dollars 20 million dollars so,0.047075752
they so my personal opinion we use 20 million dollars which you know I see,0.07233421
everything as a big community because I feel like that's what um that is what,0.0646045
our people need we need to stick together you know and the thing to spend,0.24086887
them really wrecking our communities is the whole divide and conquer mentality so we're out,0.27299297
here separately it's not going to work so let's say 20 million dollars coming out,0.068383746
of our community to create a Selma now a lot of us you know that,0.06306803
um has some time on this earth has heard about about the civil rights movement,0.12847544
you know and it's felt the struggle of the civil rights movement that is still,0.107759826
a real struggle today you know some people that are in Alabama some people that,0.05842864
are still in the rural South are still dealing with that same oppression because as,0.07624034
we as we understand you know the United States history um these people came from,0.08940432
Europe they came from Britain they came from Germany it can from italy they came,0.14990522
here and oppressed the original native american that lived on this land push them into,0.17949925
reservations massacre there there of their elders and their children this is what happened so,0.1681688
that story has been told you know even though you know it's been told from,0.039255347
there his story you know their personal accounts of what happened and um basically it,0.054342836
was bloodshed you know and and that has been their history and their story ever,0.27167416
since even leading up to this 1960s selma events called Bloody Sunday so the fact,0.17741688
that we still put ourselves in situations like that um just regarding to the 1960s,0.056056
because as I watched the video you know even though you know um the devonian,0.19010806
I think I'm murdering her name I don't want to murder her name but you,0.69542736
know she was able to you know create scenes during in the movie that was,0.08761993
that was very um heart heart wrenching you know it was tearjerkers cuz she she,0.17665954
began the movie with the with the birmingham girls in the church being just blown,0.5953617
up boo automatically took even though I wasn't even alive then you know I didn't,0.16996875
even know about how about that i was even thought of but once i seen,0.08111715
these girls get blown up on film it automatically took me there you know our,0.4164045
man took me to to the place of of the harsh races prejudice South you,0.4798246
know and but I mean it's not really surprising to me you know once I,0.104106195
because I understand history this is the Europeans history you know everywhere they went it,0.10604495
was terrorism it was it was bloodshed it was killing this is this is their,0.4171372
history so I'm saying with with visa with these certain scenes that ava devine he,0.06862537
was able to create Jesus brought me back I'm 20-24 so she just brought me,0.12873837
back to that oppression you know she brought me back to you know filling um,0.3473326
um empathy and sympathetic and just low and why me for these girls I mean,0.31089434
even though these girls has went on to you know the Act life you know,0.24671721
that the UM the forever the infinity you know they they are our essence is,0.05137232
now because if they would have live did not have been bombed by you know,0.24222116
other Christians it's ready cuz you got to understand um these people are people black,0.5876557
people in America you know black is the label they put on us but I'm,0.4032203
gonna go on you know for the sake of this review black people you know,0.53490317
um that were put down in the church at that time was bombed by white,0.6289526
Christians so there was black Christians in the church and there was white Christians outside,0.47199696
of the church bombing the church building killing our little girls that's just fact that,0.6463645
that's just this is what it was so you know it was it was cruel,0.16308081
seeing it on the scene I mean seeing it on the screen but the scene,0.1507355
was real it's what happened it was faction um other things you know the March,0.05138577
dub the bloody sunday March seeing our people walk from Selma you know going to,0.5876557
Montgomery after you know a heated um conversation with Martin Luther King and the recent,0.0797597
president LBJ at that time um on the King big basically babe he said it,0.22339204
within you know in an educated standpoint you know as depicted by Amy does devonian,0.10283595
written by Paul web though this is all text written by Paul web you have,0.093450315
to remember that Paul weapons your peanuts once you like to know that Google that,0.24143256
so so we still have the European telling this story so you know he spoke,0.059883714
to LBJ telling about the importance of us having voting rights all around the south,0.08246899
because that was something we were deprived up we would deprive the Voting Rights so,0.08907953
after that LBJ denied him said I got other things to do I got other,0.099391475
things to do so they continued on the March so they can bring awareness and,0.08243284
show what's going on to show that we need boating rights now so you know,0.14976372
um passing a little talented the towns called Lions they didn't lock the black American,0.47429076
the black citizens to pass through there they're counting these are real Christian folks to,0.43211895
these are Christian folks then other Christian folks want you guys to understand that make,0.26103854
sure that's clear so they didn't want the black people passing through their city you,0.6324041
know they call them nlgger nlgger you know they want them passing through the city,0.49542832
so you know what they did they barricaded the side of the city they barricaded,0.05839579
the bridge and they got ready for war you know being mean the white people,0.5921455
I speak about of lions i think it was Lions County they think they was,0.07339585
on horseback policeman on horseback they had policeman with bats batons they had um one,0.24052595
guy that they showed as he rolling up one of his bats with barbed wire,0.5594418
I mean ready to commit violence and this crowd of black people were just marching,0.8658363
peacefully marching peasley to Montgomery just to get voting rights I mean these rights are,0.12874894
written in the Constitution they are mean if you understand the Constitution and read the,0.062466133
bill of rights I mean we're giving inalienable rights means meaning you cannot lean on,0.13748361
the natural rights of the man you cannot lean on our rights we have rights,0.15571274
that are written and rights that are not read I mean they're given to us,0.1399107
by our Creator so these rights are infinite so boating is definitely one of those,0.05585619
so these people get beat I mean Bloody Bloody on the scene so it automatic,0.66126335
scene is another scene that brought me back to that oppression I seen my grandmother,0.19748244
my auntie my father my grandfather pause friend getting beat and talking about bloody dripping,0.72120184
you know this takes me back to that moment so in me I don't know,0.24720755
about all the other viewers out there but it definitely started building a turmoil in,0.089359686
my body you know man these white people are evil that is why people are,0.794439
here the debtors that's what I seen on screen I mean they call it there,0.07664346
the regarding to be like I'm channel um governor lee look at the governor lee,0.07911812
of alabama at that time I mean um there was a scene where he sits,0.111491546
down with LBJ and president lb taste like man you you see these civil rights,0.26944137
movements you see these nonviolent demonstrations why don't you just give these nlgger um boating,0.4810849
right just give the pony rides you know it's give it to him anyway in,0.15791944

left those same people from Lyons County that that same bloodline that same group of,0.1935257
people was raised and indoctrinated in the same ideologies are still living in Alabama now,0.17772883
I can say this with confidence because I live in alabama now I've seen it,0.041379046
personally on a personal account I've seen the oppression I've seen the prejudices I seen,0.091641955
the segregations i I've seen the discrimination on so many different levels I see what,0.24080871
the repercussions of Bloody Sunday has done to our people here in Alabama I've seen,0.31089434
it people walk around docile with their heads down you know we don't you don't,0.29885656
strive for anything you know on the account of you know the Eric garner being,0.06869841
shot in New York on the count of Mike Brown being shot in st. Louis,0.63426936
and I see our people still doing the same actions as they did then I'm,0.0778455
bloody sunday waiting for the police to go horseback and knock them over waiting for,0.7843001
the police to wrap their bats in barbed wire and hit they're just waiting to,0.53490317
be a press waiting to be brutalized waiting to be harassed that is what we,0.2708687
wait for we want the world to see us get beat why why why do,0.12997109
we want to be in such a docile state do we not understand that that,0.17853932
in the days of Kemet in the days of newbie in the days of the,0.07479767
great cushion push em pyres in Ethiopia we were kings and warriors we were kings,0.4552769
and warriors I was watching a Native American doctor documented me the other day it,0.100314625
was on on him the aim Association when they were fighting for their rights and,0.08461987
the Native Americans are fighting for their rights at a very similar time when you,0.2422343
know the black America's fighting for their rights and when they was fighting for their,0.46079296
rights they they got in touch with their spiritual self they got in touch with,0.17949367
their ancestors they got in touch with the ancient rituals their people used to do,0.14524408
back in the day when I seen you know Selma I'm good where we're focused,0.06479008
on Selma now every time we had a conference every time we came together to,0.05990451
talk about the events that were going on where we yet we're in the church,0.06400616
who built the church the southern white man who taught you about Jesus Christ who,0.3521621
taught you about the King James version of the Bible who taught you that it,0.11516411
was the slave master it's written is written the slave masters talk to you about,0.31089434
King James the slave masters talk to you about Christian be and where do we,0.4071867
come together at when we want to talk about I guess I even joining the,0.07582092
slave masters because right then we're pushing integration we wanted to go into their systems,0.28771234
we wanted to vote for our own senators and governors but we have to realize,0.07282642
that governmental system of democracy is their sister it is the slave master system so,0.17719083
let's wait you're talking about fighting for boating what really confused me and had me,0.14374715
perplexed over the the movie is out of everything we can fight for out of,0.16226825
everything to fight for it with with promises the 40 acres of them and the,0.107911326
meal I was even born then but this is what I see we had the,0.060347483
40 acres in a meal to fight for we had perfect sovereignty to fight for,0.08713055
we had you know um take us back to Africa the great Marcus Garvey spoke,0.124606036
about pan-africanism you know by moving back to the motherland they don't want us here,0.17921218
apparently apparently when we watch it counts as as you know Selma Bloody Sunday we,0.19465186
see the history of them not morning us here but yet we want to fight,0.15087095
and integrate into their system the great Malcolm met the great teacher Malcolm X he,0.05688707
spoke about this a lot why what why try to fight and n be brutalized,0.19475275
because of us wanting to sit at their counters and eat or us wanting to,0.11924273
go to the schools with their kids so they could teach us about Columbus Columbus,0.1366481
founding you know America which we know is wrong when she know was not a,0.13805601
relevant statement in the perspective of us being melon 80 people that have been on,0.08038807
this this here land that they call America's since the beginning of time look up,0.103697516
the Native Americans I want you guys to look up the Morse nation you know,0.13227129
there were tribes here that were originally here way before the European came here that,0.07399859
looked just like you would we fighting for rights in their system while we had,0.13690822
our own system intact and in place on these lands here just look it up,0.071358666

from this video when i watch summer i just feel like we're being stagnant we're,0.05323381
just standing in one place is not moving for let's move forward this is the,0.08265631
information age now then you can say during slavery even though that is a small,0.15015596
span of time you know when we talk about you know being melon ated being,0.07721795
African being black being whatever if you look like if you have skin of copper,0.6045038
color or darker you are me you are my bloodline you are my bloodline which,0.092541106
we have originated from kings and queens the originator of the earth just look at,0.102342255
the information because there's information out here so as a community we could go past,0.04050863
slavery I feel like us making movies as in Selma we're just reminding ourselves with,0.24022384
oppression a small period of our life we've been around since the beginning of time,0.1737784
let's tell that story we go past the caveman let's go past that story don't,0.19782932
even don't even think paleo think the great Asiatics think the great um I could,0.27663597

know us telling the story of selma and i want to say rest in peace,0.07152137
all of the ancestors that sacrifice their life for settlement because that's what they seem,0.257666
fit at that time so i don't say anything is wrong i'm not saying anything,0.07951926
is wrong with those actions that those people at that time took but this is,0.12726639
our time now we have to walk through the doors that they open we have,0.051370155
to live the dream of Martin Luther King reactor we have to actually put into,0.0813474
action these things that our great ancestor sacrifice forward and create our own create our,0.082097426
own stories instead of Selma let's talk about the great ancient commit cuz they're doing,0.056855537
