what's going on on my youtube videos i'm jacob with another movie review for you,0.09308081
guys and continuing on in my series of billy wilder reviews in today's video i'll,0.11120118
be taking a look at the 1944 film considered one of his very best double,0.060860336
indemnity i killed dietrich me walden f insurance agent 35 years old unmarried no visible,0.4946623
scars until a while ago that is yeah i killed it i killed it for,0.7449736
money for a woman a rich woman and a calculating insurance agent plot to kill,0.6601396
her unsuspecting husband after he signs a double indemnity policy against a backdrop of distinctly,0.34967843
california settings the partners in crime plan the perfect murder to collect the insurance which,0.49080375
pays double if the death is accidental so double indemnity was released in 1944 and,0.17768212
this was the film that solidified billy wilder as a top tier director ever since,0.095343985
its release back then this was seen as an amazing film it broke a lot,0.08175668
of grounds and it was considered the first film the war which was a popular,0.07120006
genre especially throughout the 40s and 50s these very gritty black and white films usually,0.0074783177
dealing within the criminal lifestyle and whether they can get away with murder or any,0.2775844
other extravagant crime or not usually shot in black and white the music is very,0.09352467
moody there's usually narration going on told in the point of view of one of,0.030854566
the criminals there's definitely a lot of tropes in the genre that originally started with,0.19428444
this movie and this was a movie that many people loved when it came out,0.09589074
and it was seen as a risk to make a movie like this as there,0.055841815
was a lot of production censorship codes that were going on at the time and,0.069351785
the censors didn't like movies told in the perspective of criminals because they believed that,0.13306458
was bad you shouldn't tell movies like this there was fears that a movie like,0.1844238
this would brainwash younger children and the following in their footsteps as silly as that,0.7692285
sounds but billy wilder and the crew were able to find ways to get around,0.076187216
the sensors tell a brilliant ending with a payoff that would make the sensors happy,0.0755693
while still making it work within the context of the story and make an effective,0.028406724
thriller that's just as effective and entertaining to watch today as it was back in,0.08633437
1944 this is the second time i have seen this movie the first time i,0.09898586
saw it was a few years ago when i caught it on turner classic movies,0.10326477
definitely respect them for helping me get into a wider assortment of cinema during my,0.08481774
teenage years this is the second time i have seen the film in full for,0.02676954
this director project and i think this is a great film this is the first,0.056525487
great film i would say that i've seen from billy wilder going through his filmography,0.14535838
in chronological order i think what he brings to the table both as a writer,0.073587
with his very smartly detailed and written script along with the slick direction is very,0.0759875
top-notch i would say this is a prototype for sunset boulevard which spoiler alert i,0.090625465
think is an even better film the war i think that movie is absolutely insane,0.42789283
and it's one of the best written classic films i've ever seen in my life,0.115732715
and i'm excited to revisit that one again you can definitely see the prototype here,0.081553
that led to an even better film i do enjoy the performances in double indemnity,0.28235242
fred mcmurray was definitely a risk too because apparently before he was cast in double,0.13040067
indemnity he mainly starred in a lot of romantic comedies but here he plays this,0.076926224
insurance man who conspires with another woman to commit a murder to collect the insurance,0.5628973
yeah you wouldn't expect that that was definitely a risk and i think he made,0.13082835
it work i think he gave a good performance along with barbara stanwick as the,0.06962355
very conniving rich woman who cheats on her husband falls for this insurance guy and,0.5876557
they plan the perfect crazy murder crime parts of this movie feel like alfred hitchcock,0.6364068
at times i think hitchcock would have gone further and further into the madness of,0.4336404
the plot it's interesting because the whole murder plot happens like halfway into the movie,0.18113093
there's the build up in the first half and then there's the fallout in the,0.04384068
second half to see if they get away with it or not and i think,0.123907685
it was done in a very interesting structure i really respect billy wilder for doing,0.07625444
that because normally murder plots would happen far later into the film but here it's,0.14873181
done halfway into the film and it's a very suspenseful sequence to see if they,0.07004806
can pull this off or not to make it look like this death was an,0.24135415
accident instead of murder so they can get away with the insurance money and double,0.31089434
if it's an accidental death with the double indemnity clause and that makes the film,0.15114498
very suspenseful you also got edward g robinson in this film who plays the claims,0.10001306
manager at the insurance agency that fred mcmurray's character works for who is very much,0.08357743
on to this case and i greatly enjoy that with g robinson's performance he definitely,0.24209024
played against type 2 because edward g robinson was best known for starring in gangster,0.31089434
movies at the time and here he's actually the good guy in this film and,0.107226945
i thought that was very interesting and very refreshing and he pulled that off very,0.052521076
well too especially when he's paired alongside both barbara sandwick and fred murray when the,0.07624787
three are on together this movie electrifies in powerhouse performances and that witty script that,0.06976632
billy wilder brings to the table i'd say the only thing that brings double indemnity,0.33799788
down for me is even though i enjoy the performances even though i enjoy the,0.12870352
storytelling even though i love the direction and filmmaking i don't really find our two,0.06039788
main characters all that interesting even though i do think both are great actors i,0.07435577
do enjoy the performances i just cannot connect with fred's character or barbara sandlick's character,0.09022515
i think it's because they're both written to be very unlikable it's really hard finding,0.29296288
any sympathy or anything for any of these characters and why they're making these bad,0.18424696
decisions and i think even in some of the hitchcock movies even though some of,0.4029166
the characters that we follow are very unlikable there's still a little bit of sympathy,0.3225198
towards some of these characters and why they end up making some of these bad,0.21470256
decisions especially movies like in vertigo and psycho that comes to mind off the top,0.425366
of my head here with double indemnity i just see two awful characters doing awful,0.35417935
things i'm just waiting for that to be bit in the butt in the end,0.77633464
here i just see these two characters i'm like i'm enjoying the storytelling but i'm,0.055423263
not connecting with any of these characters it's a movie that i love and admire,0.10677954
but it's not a personal favorite it doesn't impact me personally compared to some of,0.06425389
billy wilder's other films which i think are even better than this but double indemnity,0.35029304
was still a great start for a great career that spanned decades for this incredible,0.05610856
director this was definitely the first top-tier great film from billy wilder i enjoyed his,0.086704075
previous films particularly major in the minor and five graves of cairo but i didn't,0.06272824
love him i do really love double indemnity it's not a personal favorite there's definitely,0.17874585
this disconnect especially with some of our main characters but it's still incredibly directed i,0.06854444
love the performances i love the script i love the suspense i respect it for,0.070028506
being the benchmark to a whole genre that was so popular and prominent during that,0.030060071
time and it's still one of the finest films of that era in filmmaking and,0.0599522
i highly respect double indemnity for that alone i'm glad i revisited this one again,0.14476861
because it's such a really good film especially the script especially the suspense and especially,0.064413965
the performances in billy wilder's direction i definitely highly recommend this one if you want,0.07428582
a good introduction to the film the war genre this is definitely a great place,0.07138603
to start and then look up some of the other new wars of that time,0.11797683
and watch them as well this is definitely a great introduction for newbies of the,0.12726785
genre it's got billy wilder directing it he made a lot of great films and,0.15256165
this i'd say was the first really great film in his long-running filmography i'm gonna,0.108188994
give double indemnity a four and a half out of five stars and on the,0.070141815
hundred point scale it's getting an 84 out of a hundred so that wraps up,0.14932476
