Daniel Craig plays the equally eccentric detective who's investigating and everyone else is a suspect,0.19877937
murder mysteries are very successful on TV but you don't see as many of them,0.28674278
in film my mom has always loved the Miss Marple show and Murder She Wrote,0.72499603
and all of those shows you know that like people like to gather around the,0.07174855
TV and watch and try to figure out who did it you don't get as,0.08757858
many of that in film last year we had the remake of the Murder on,0.11704203
the Orient Express and the best of the bunch in my opinion clue which stars,0.07540868
Tim Curry who is a perfect and flawless human being and there's the Sherlock Holmes,0.15445046
movies with Robert Downey jr. but even those are based off of a very popular,0.07488571
character in literature it's been a while since we've had an original murder mystery that,0.13552316
isn't based off of something else brand new characters brand new story Rian Johnson is,0.0500369
a really good director for this type of film brick is in a way the,0.08497336
tech t'v story as well and it's probably still my favorite of his films but,0.115927495
this one got really close this is an ingenious film extremely well-written filled with charismatic,0.17704196
characters and actors giving some of their best performances Daniel nlgger Craig holy nlgger this,0.25639558
is a performance this is like super over the top with an insane accent and,0.25982943
I loved every minute of it he owns this whole nlgger movie he has this,0.4260975
crazy Southern drawl and when he first started talking I actually sat back a little,0.38426393
bit in my seat blown away by hearing that voice come out of that man,0.36266845
and I wondered is this working for me and like 10 seconds later I was,0.07958334
like oh nlgger yeah oh mmm that's working for me jokes aside I loved him,0.31089434
here sometimes you get performances that are really over-the-top like this one and there will,0.07591219
be some people who think he's really hamming it up for some reason even though,0.1884295
it's incredibly obvious that he's doing it on purpose this is a very tongue-in-cheek performance,0.24259885
that is almost winking Lee aware of the genre trappings of a whodunit on a,0.11334044
day are moss and I apologize if I said her name incorrectly she's really great,0.120903745
here as well I've seen her pop up in a lot of movies obviously Blade,0.06358413
Runner 2049 she's been doing a lot of things lately but she gets a big,0.14913778
role in this movie front and center and she's excellent however there is one shot,0.33445525
in this movie where an actor gave what I imagine must have been his most,0.1001551
difficult performance to date Chris Evans has a shot where he has to pretend like,0.24013832
he doesn't like dogs it must have been horrible for him I joke but he,0.2708052
really was great in the film as well there's not a weak link in this,0.064424165
entire cast everyone brought their a-game and they're also reading dialogue that's witty clever and,0.15815508
intelligent that constantly pits its characters and conflicting situations that raises the tension in every,0.108063176
scene and Johnson had a difficult job with this movie because it's a comedy with,0.12606682
suspense you want your audience to laugh when you want them to laugh but you,0.17247783
don't want to release them from tension so much that they don't feel tense when,0.07913852
you want them to and he found a great balance between those and just about,0.060239118
every scene for instance Daniel Craig's character comes on very strong at first and you're,0.05975386
like wow this is really entertaining and weird and it's just nlgger bizarre but then,0.31089434
there's a scene later on where he's sort of leaning back in the shadows smoking,0.22510748
a cigar and you just see that cigar tip light up in the dark and,0.0756728
you're like ooh that guy's hiding something so he keeps his characters mysterious even when,0.23373066
it seems like they're being their full selves in front of everyone now I don't,0.10147966
want to get into any spoilers of course because the movies not gonna come out,0.15800937
for another week but the film has a really unique take on the whodunit in,0.067323804
regards to what information it lets you know early on a lot more than you,0.091430336
would expect to know early on for these types of movies and it sort of,0.05422767
makes you rethink how you process a whodunit because you usually go into one of,0.15142134
these thinking all right well let's try to figure out which one of these bastards,0.9156528
did the thing but this movie is kind of like well here's some info and,0.07505236
because of that you're second-guessing yourself throughout the entire movie as for issues I don't,0.14576676
really have that many I think this is a good time with the movies and,0.04298272
it's just the type of movie it should have been but there are some characters,0.073634386
in the movie that are a bit throwaway they're there as a one-note joke of,0.18051079
sorts that have maybe three to four lines in the entire movie there's a young,0.07810114
character in the movie that is glued to the phone for the majority of the,0.040552225
film and he's the butt of many jokes but he doesn't have the chance to,0.69542736
actually be a character really he's just kind of there to be laughed at and,0.099249385
that's okay I mean that happens a lot in movies it's just that this movie,0.11078437
is so smart and so clever that that felt a bit disposable to me that,0.32958245
you had this opportunity and he didn't really do anything with it it was just,0.08567656
like a one joke character and there's also a few scenes where the characters have,0.12623101
to leave the house and engage in things outside and it's never as claustrophobic or,0.10229482
as suspenseful as when they're all trapped there it's not that the outside scenes are,0.097425856
necessarily bad it's just that they're not as entertaining as the scenes at the house,0.1712799
knives out is exactly the film I wanted it to be this is really in,0.15491322
