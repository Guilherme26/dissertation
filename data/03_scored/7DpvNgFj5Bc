i literally got vsmr right now oh my god tommy's dying though hey this is,0.09893744
can you hear me oh for nlgger sakes god i started out hating this man,0.6364068
and now i've cried for him twice oh god his light went out oh god,0.15409417
so i thought i probably better record a little greeting in the case of my,0.0773496
timely death what a funeral i love you three thousand oh my god oh god,0.38985297
proof that tony stark has a heart oh my heart really hurts you know why,0.13433969
i hurt so much because he did it all out of selflessness and i started,0.33266285
off thinking that he was the most selfish nlgger that i have ever seen in,0.5972774
any film or tv show that i had ever seen and he went out doing,0.1501351
something so selfless for the rest of the world despite the fact that he has,0.066285506
a family and he and he wanted to he didn't want to give that up,0.0785565
he made that abundantly clear but when it came down to it tony stark has,0.09375663
a heart he does oh man fury it's so good to see fury oh god,0.108636625
i'm such a mess i have no path i do have a ride though move,0.105387576
it or lose it airbag oh wow he's gonna go into space that's awesome i,0.15202965
really want to know the galaxy back together again you should fight one another for,0.1436546
the honor of leadership oh my god it's not necessary i got some blasters you,0.25898376
guys sorry please use knives on board there shall be no knifing one another everybody,0.39036477
knows who's in charge right yes this is so awkward nlgger two one what the,0.31199074
heck what the heck he's had oh i know i know what he's done he's,0.508845
going back to his skinny self or his child self or his old self i,0.5876557
don't know anymore oh his old self i said maybe uh try some of that,0.27635458
life tony was telling me to get it's beautiful oh i'm happy for you that,0.16200179
makes me really happy to hear that's a really good ending for him he's gonna,0.34647602
give his suit to him wow now it's bucky's turn to turn old again then,0.3480694
they can be old besties together you want to tell me about her no no,0.31465587
i don't think i will oh oh oh that makes me really happy you got,0.23449616
a second chance with a oh god i love love there's no end credit scenes,0.08854845
i'm not used to that what's happened that makes me so sad so it's been,0.10225609
a really long day it is now 9 53 p.m and i got my hair,0.11731369
done this very day and i got it in memory of gamora and i don't,0.049100697
know a little part of me thought that maybe a version of her would still,0.12891923
exist but sadly gamora is nomura she's definitely nomura just like the black widow and,0.016096925
it does make me sad this movie was really sad the first two hours was,0.15128186
super depressing uh you could probably tell that whilst i was reacting to it i,0.40330508
was in a pretty somber mood the mood was definitely not upbeat i was definitely,0.08640153
not feeling as bubbly and as chirpy as some of the other films have made,0.09557902
me feel and that was to be expected because this film is the conclusion of,0.08495618
this grand story that we've been following along for well you guys have been following,0.054413408
along for 10 years i've been following along for a few months now um and,0.034266096
it just came to a close so mixed feelings is pretty much a given i,0.1489575
think for this one um the first two hours was a little bit slow because,0.24076386
we were just kind of catching up with what was going on it was 23,0.062186174
days after infinity war and we were just catching up on how everybody's feeling five,0.14878814
years after they first approached tony they actually start making movements with their new mission,0.07658137
pretty sure we got to see pretty much every single mcu character except for probably,0.089161895
jane's friends it was really nostalgic i can't imagine how you guys would have felt,0.13034561
seeing all of these scenes because you had the actual weight that i didn't have,0.13561718
i saw these all very recently so it's not as nostalgic for me i'm sure,0.13037947
i'll feel nostalgic after a few more years if i decide to rewatch endgame there,0.041421752
was definitely a lot to unpack i feel like everyone including tony had a really,0.064525425
nice conclusion obviously tony passed away he died he is no longer a father to,0.4030981
his beautiful daughter morgan he's no longer a husband to his beautiful peppa but the,0.31599373
way he went out was really noble and really honorable and i don't think that,0.080822274
anybody else could have done it he started this amazing world with iron man and,0.15708399
i really couldn't have imagined it to go any other way i mean sure maybe,0.05290701
the hulk could have done it it wouldn't have had the payoff as it did,0.06297659
uh with tony because tony's character development has just gone full circle i could not,0.08693994
be more proud of tony and how far he's come i do want to talk,0.09910613
about thor as well because i feel like he had definitely the saddest story that,0.10584589
we've seen he is on his own now he joined the outcasts the guardians of,0.079281405
the galaxy everyone in that crew doesn't really have a family or a place to,0.053157754
belong but they belong with each other so i am glad that thor got to,0.17550153
have a place to belong in the end because he lost all of his family,0.22371097
members he lost all of his best friends sif included and you know how i,0.14186105
feel about sif and thor i wanted them to have a happy ending and a,0.110870704
nice romance but that never happened and his character definitely changed a lot throughout this,0.059491288
entire series we saw him as a very arrogant jerk in the first thor movie,0.8060606
and then he found love and he got to experience earth and what it was,0.058937162
like to be amongst humans and he experienced loss and he experienced family drama including,0.09716487
his crazy sister heller and his chaotic brother loki constantly testing his character i especially,0.6740426
like how taika waititi made thought a lot less boring in the third thor film,0.15484165
so i certainly appreciated his style of directing in that one um i was super,0.08758994
sad to see natasha go the way she did but hawkeye has a family he,0.1034935
has a wife and natasha as sad as it is she doesn't really have any,0.24021436
of that she was quite alone all she really had was the avengers so i,0.13302863
pretty much predicted that natasha would die i did not think originally that tony stark,0.44137102
would die i did see someone say that tony stark would die because i asked,0.58455074
people to give me fake spoilers i assumed it was a fake spoiler that was,0.24415489
certainly really unexpected for me i really liked seeing captain america's conclusion as well i,0.07441058
really liked the ending clint god as well and then also seeing ant-man and hope,0.14902398
and cassie in the end as well embracing there were a lot of heartwarming moments,0.09578606
for sure i love seeing wanda again i love seeing captain marvel again and doctor,0.059498012
strange a lot of people showed up to do their bit but we didn't get,0.10026476
all the screen time with them so if they happen to be your favorite characters,0.056901604
you might have been a bit disappointed but for me i was quite happy with,0.20118365
how everything panned out it didn't have the comedy element that some of the other,0.09650857
mcu movies have but i think that if there was comedy in this or if,0.09308869
i had laughed as much as i did in saito or guardians of the galaxy,0.11685146
or even avengers the first one it wouldn't have felt like the conclusion of a,0.066140264
huge superhero franchise i must say that i didn't think they would dive into time,0.06776338
travel in the quantum realm but once ant-man made an appearance and he came out,0.14455117
of the quantum realm and he observed his findings and he learned and he came,0.04761639
up with this hypothesis i was like this is starting to make sense they might,0.09675833
be able to time travel without the time travel infinity stone and when i was,0.046993013
wrapping up my infinity war movie reaction video i was saying something like if there's,0.15728723
a way they can go back in time or if there's a way to go,0.07093394
to thanos get the time infinity stone there might be a way to bring people,0.0867162
back and i wasn't exactly right but they definitely did use time to try and,0.056152694
save their story and i'm glad they did it in a less obvious way in,0.10041545
a way that tied into everything very well and it made a lot of sense,0.07768967
i think the pacing could have been a little bit better if i were to,0.07972451
rank the avengers infinity war movie against the avengers endgame movie i'd probably say i,0.14632751
was more invested in infinity war just because i really loved the pacing and there,0.077624016
was comedy there was action there were a lot of emotional moments it was heavy,0.10690917
it was deep and thanos won which completely shook me because it skewed my perception,0.10545955
of what a typical superhero movie is we've got the superhero genre that tells us,0.054987323
that the hero has a journey and this is the way it's meant to be,0.060818363
and that didn't happen in infinity war so it just shocked me to my core,0.16883413
i was very thrown because i knew that after end game there was spider-man i,0.1487692
did know in my heart of hearts that the heroes will end up winning whereas,0.040631704
in infinity war i had no idea and that aspect threw me off i think,0.17458797
it was infinity war where i saw everybody dying in the first 10 minutes and,0.24173138
i was like what the heck is going on whereas with endgame i was a,0.32382086
little bit more prepared and more well oiled for the tragedy so those were my,0.12443356
thoughts i'm sorry that it was kind of all over the place and so i,0.08494768
might not have said everything that i wanted to say but those were all of,0.13902749
my thoughts at this very moment after i have watched endgame they're quite raw i'll,0.08578823
probably have more things to say about it as time progresses so yeah let me,0.09532406
know what you guys thought of this film in the comment section below the first,0.106420904
