good things this film did first things first I'm gonna say that Roma might not,0.04082099
be for everyone one if you're not into black and white movies not gonna work,0.19020927
if you're not into reading subtitles or it being in a foreign language probably not,0.023030654
gonna work and this is a very much art houseing personalized story so if you're,0.018424923
not into that Roma's probably not gonna be there for you anyways getting the into,0.05400094
Roma this is a very beautifully shot film I mean obviously it was a bold,0.17054045
choice or the directors choice to have this all in black and white hold on,0.04312452
a sec but you know a lot of the shots that he has in this,0.09976824
film are really enhanced by that black and white color choice from the opening credits,0.007966239
of having the skyline reflected on to like the wet tile of the floor or,0.21529268
the closing kind of sequence of having this wondrous beautiful sunset in the background when,0.18456519
they're on the beach through and through I personally think that Roma is one of,0.028555669
the most beautiful films of 2018 and it's not just the beautiful shots but there's,0.09282638
also these really good or really satisfying tracking shots following Clio as she kind of,0.24911745
her and her friend go down a street and it follows them or when she's,0.07627528
in the house of Sofia and she's going through and turning off all the lights,0.03087583
before bedtime it really the camera just kind of follows her throughout this sequence and,0.02743816
it's really satisfying also korone did this thing maybe he wants twice maybe three times,0.027191376
in this movie where the main character or the characters that we are focused we're,0.0103076855
in the foreground and it's a very emotional time in those characters lives but in,0.020504287
the background there's kind of like light-hearted fun happiness going on so it's really this,0.023810914
dual like emotional aspect that's really almost like it's satisfying but also cruel at the,0.055014014
same time it was a little off-putting the first time I saw but again korone,0.054143287
knew what he was doing in this film and it really ties everything together as,0.030770065
for the story in Roma it really has this kind of main storyline it's very,0.017323378
emotional and it follows Cleo as she you know she's this made for this family,0.037033435
of a wife her husband and four kids but then as the story kind of,0.030972946
goes on you get more in depth into her story you find out that she,0.031469174
gets pregnant the guy isn't really the best guy she has to go through all,0.13699657
of this emotional stuff by herself and it's just it's a really heartbreaking story I,0.029305331
will say that right away it kind of felt like a cliched story where you,0.03428955
know this one person gets pregnant the guy leaves her but then it does take,0.058810882
these twists and turns that again are very emotional very painful and it's just it's,0.10514758
not something that you're really used to and next to the main storyline of Cleo,0.06486006
and what she has to really deal with there's also kind of this subtle it,0.028189817
kind of takes more screen time towards the end story between Sophia her husband and,0.046689905
the four kids and the family in general basically Sophia's husband is this doctor he,0.026792267
obviously it's revealed that he's kind of cheating he has a mistress so that's really,0.120992914
taking a toll on Sophia and the kids and it shows how she has to,0.036616363
really struggle between keeping her life together or keeping her emotions in check while also,0.06021442
you know kind of putting on this facade for the kids before she can officially,0.0885273
tell them it's these dual stories that really keep things interesting and makes the story,0.019692762
kind of flow on and again Sophia and Cleo actually kind of come together at,0.08092158
the end and they're there for each other through honestly some of the emotional stuff,0.032019947
that they've ever had to deal with in their lives however I did not think,0.08631623
that Roma was as perfect as some critics are saying obviously it takes on this,0.040631413
foreign film aspect there's subtitles there's black-and-white you got to get over that stuff but,0.020973906
my lord this movie is slow and I mean solo it's definitely more of an,0.06943985
arthouse he kind of needs type movie and there's a lot of shots or sequences,0.09471949
that are supposed to hang on you as a viewer and it does hang on,0.34917113
you but sometimes it's focusing or looking at certain things for much too long and,0.023440406
the shot just it just carries on also like I said that it's you know,0.09942167
this art house the indie type of film there were some scenes that just felt,0.032937232
out of place I honestly I didn't even you know what just lets roll one,0.08542089
of them over all Roma is this uniquely shot in emotional driven film with some,0.14729561
beautiful shots korone really toying with our emotions and this emotional twofold story that floats,0.19470723
throughout but with it unfolding very much slowly and some art housey type material I'd,0.03107605
recommend checking out Roma if you have the chance I mean pretty much everyone has,0.06965338
Netflix so you know turn it on give it a try in closing I'm gonna,0.08065884
give Roma four point four out of five emotional black-and-white shots so what did you,0.12145721
