hey everyone I'm Mariana and I am back with another review talking about one of,0.07989862
my most anticipated films of the year featuring one of the most amazing ensemble casts,0.071778305
of the year knives out this is the fifth film written and directed by Rian,0.119230986
Johnson and it is a murder mystery a modern take on that classic whodunit detective,0.2742241
story here a family patriarch is found dead after his 85th birthday celebration and while,0.31089434
the death is considered to be a suicide things may not be as simple as,0.360448
they seem so a private detective Benoit Blanc is here to investigate this entire family,0.15159515
I had a lot of fun watching this film it was incredibly entertaining and actually,0.09099558
funnier than I expected it to be there were some parts of knives out that,0.19339786
I thought were absolutely hilarious of course there are also a lot of twists and,0.08278235
turns to the story a lot of clues to keep you guessing some more obvious,0.053112768
than others I love a good mystery that revolves around family secrets and lies which,0.11607773
is pretty much the core of this film and you know people are lying here,0.3465977
not just because you can tell by the kind of family this is and the,0.063115105
kind of film that this is but also because the movie will often show you,0.0721269
the real events in a flashback and then cut back to the person in question,0.20964944
talking to the detective and telling him something a bit different which is a lot,0.10258339
of fun to watch I will say that the trailers show way too much and,0.05797546
I'm going to be very careful with the footage and the photos that I include,0.07296996
in this review not to spoil anything for you because I am so glad that,0.10724097
I wasn't really paying too much attention to the first trailer when I was watching,0.065071665
it and then decided to just avoid the rest of the trailers because now that,0.096214645
I watched all of them after seeing the film I can see how much they,0.07696887
included from the second half of the movie including some very crucial bits of information,0.066247396
basically if you did see the trailers I suggest you try to forget them as,0.09401214
much as possible back to the actual film though let's talk about that cast because,0.05735811
all of these actors are great unfortunately with a cast this large you are bound,0.184348
to have people who are underused which definitely happened in this film but there were,0.039081857
some amazing standout performances that were really fun to watch we have Toni Collette and,0.05207779
Jamie Lee Curtis who are both absolutely hilarious and very memorable even though they don't,0.14648834
have huge roles Toni Collette especially her performance is just the right amount of exaggerated,0.13657656
and I guarantee you're going to remember her character after seeing this film Michael Shannon,0.060805686
always has an intense presence on screen and knives out is no exception I am,0.14868714
yet to see him in a role where he doesn't stand out no matter if,0.18477365
it's big or small Chris Evans of course is wonderful he is one of the,0.06084194
grandsons and he is kind of a spoiled playboy which is a lot of fun,0.4033307
to watch he has some great scenes in there Ana de Armas whom you may,0.15312481
remember from Blade Runner 2049 has one of the bigger roles and she is the,0.034976367
nicest person in this cast of characters she really does well plane this genuinely caring,0.13044162
and kind human being and of course Daniel Craig as the detective is as good,0.13361022
as you would expect this is an excellent role for him although I will say,0.09971208
that his accent here really threw me off he has a very heavy over-the-top southern,0.2412167
accent in the film and I get that perhaps this was meant to be over-the-top,0.0399201
for a comedic purpose but it just really took me out almost every scene it,0.07422491
just felt like he was putting on an accent here which of course he was,0.093312494
because this is not what Daniel Craig sounds like in real life but he has,0.11594043
done a southern accent before in Logan lucky which I thought was great I thought,0.09265989
he did a really good job in that film here though it just it seemed,0.05003821
off to and it seemed like it was work for him also since I am,0.06910622
getting into some of my issues with the film I have to say that some,0.09384659
of the writing was a little too cheesy both the dialogue and some of the,0.08008765
actions that characters took even though I get that this is a very comedic mystery,0.07719666
and it's meant to be crowd pleasing and fun some of it was just a,0.117466114
little too ridiculous and to go along with that there are a lot of attempts,0.69542736
in this film to be hashtag relevant through dialogue which I thought were really out,0.10792431
of place in this story in particular I just did not think this was necessary,0.079851516
at all here I don't have an issue with that as a thing of its,0.080392934
own but in this story this could have been such a timeless murder mystery especially,0.15288413
with the set up and this gorgeous atmospheric house and the overall production design and,0.08300856
this snake nest of a family and all of this brought together this is such,0.2881748
a classic murder mystery set up but then they have these buzzword jokes about snowflakes,0.3453625
and all trite roles and politics and Instagram influencers which I just don't think this,0.10857326
story needed basically what I'm trying to say here is that there were these small,0.0763898
things that kept this movie from being even better this could have been a really,0.05295756
fantastic film it could have been one of my favorites of the year like top,0.07652447
five material however these small things kind of add it up and instead of having,0.0662375
a fantastic film it ended up being really great I would still absolutely recommend you,0.10432967
go see it it is so much fun to watch especially figure with other people,0.1386872
it is a gorgeous film to watch on the big screen as I mentioned the,0.052682314
cast is absolutely fantastic you are going to have a ton of fun watching this,0.15104188
