her she cleans the household she loves the children that she looks after and she,0.06717889
lives a very very simple life this is by no means a plot driven film,0.068491966
it's very much character driven we are following cleo seeing things happen to her through,0.01700143
her eyes through her points of view but it's more about a scene setting it's,0.07985729
more about living this immersive view into the family into this very specific time capsule,0.06871281
of history and showing that maybe things haven't changed so much today in 2018 as,0.012192151
we might like to think they have her on is a big fan of the,0.027601795
effect that a cleverly constructed single take can bring he did it fantastically in children,0.0683709
of men one of my favorite movie scenes of all time and here in roma,0.09346296
there is another one that takes place on the beach and it's toward the end,0.039121445
of the film but it is very much a climactic and extremely emotional moment on,0.014230939
the beach in the waves all from the side angle of cleo as we follow,0.018895872
her and we track her up and down the beach and into the water no,0.07503072
that she can't swim and it is just it is so tense it's done so,0.05039032

these cuts from the water under the water following around up close it's sort of,0.025811786
like by stepping back and just following it in this real-time way it's it's even,0.04108174
more like heart pounding I adored this film from start to finish I was so,0.090538144
invested in the character of Cleo in her decisions and how she was going to,0.017135795
manage the obstacles that kept coming up against her the way that she fits into,0.0509238
the family dynamics is really fascinating in the relationship especially between her and the mother,0.025690723
you know the matriarch of the family how they kind of fit together it just,0.14463155
felt really real they don't always see eye to eye but at the end of,0.024636406
the day they both care for the children the only thing I will note is,0.045737363
that this is portrayed in a romanticized wait a snapshot of time from qur'an's own,0.040035408
childhood so it's him as a filmmaker reflecting on his childhood you can see that,0.04799566
come through in the film and in that as well some of the characters romanticized,0.016891673
so even though it's real and raw and tender these are people that have been,0.064357184
elevated in memory because when you look back on things things always just seem different,0.023796279
in memory and that's certainly not a negative critique if anything that's even more interesting,0.016779257
to see the filmmaker himself within his own film which is really unusual to see,0.029979162
it so intertwined in such a way like this film is Kuran exploring his own,0.07483316
