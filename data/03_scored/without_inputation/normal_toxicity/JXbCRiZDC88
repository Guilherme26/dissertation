now that's I do a Star Wars movie,0.056583453
hi guys welcome to my name is Kendall anyway,0.07611504
it's finally time,0.06289601
it's the most anticipated movie of 2017 Star Wars the last Jedi,0.050367083
so many people were hyped for this myself included because it's Star Wars how could you not be excited for Star Wars,0.12107808
this one is the most iconic franchise of all time,0.07869927
so let's get this ball rolling,0.14890163
so the last Jedi takes place right after the force awakens and rain has found Luke Skywalker,0.065312326
he's been in hiding for so long because he feels bad then he turned kylo Ren aka Ben solo over to the dark side,0.16778918
and he wasn't able to save him and ray wants to learn the ways of the force,0.18959925
he's trying to get Luke to teach her those things but he's like it,0.14957692
I'm done,0.06767692
I don't want anything to do with the force anymore I'm just gonna live in my little Hut doing my own thing and meanwhile on the other side of the galaxy,0.16083054
the resistance is being tracked down by the first order who really really want to kill them they have them corner,0.62099653
so you have like lay up pull Finn they're all trying to figure out how to escape him,0.17115077
and thus we have a pretty excellent movie like,0.085656196
I said,0.051518872
I was really high for this movie but I wouldn't go as far saying it I was in like my most anticipated movies of the year that was that went to like Blade Runner and Dunkirk to war for the pond apes because I I knew this was gonna be good it's a post,0.15315063
George Lucas Star Wars movie I mean come on it's not without its flaws,0.23265807
but I still loved it nonetheless,0.06673959
what really works in this movie is the characters and the character motivations that was kind of the problem with the prequels is that though all the character motivations were a little bit muddled,0.09962126
they didn't really know what characters wanted to do what they were thinking you didn't really feel like you got in the minds of the main characters,0.072524406
and now with the sequels you know that's not the case these characters are much better fleshed out than George Lucas ever could have done ray gets a lot more attention in this movie the character grows even more so than she did in the force awakens rey and Johnson's direction this movie is it is awesome,0.06991237
this film is not quite as fast-paced as a force awakens as if you remember that everybody just flew by this one's a little slower it kind of takes a little bit time to sit the story aside and it's more filled in with the characters than anything else,0.07260156
so if you go in expecting the lightning fast Aysen force awakens and you're gonna be disappointed because that's not here with the last Jedi,0.08642775
this is a lot more of a somber slower paced film,0.12293487
yeah actually which is across the board a fan-fucking-tastic it's it's Star Wars movie come on,0.8606264
let's say that's the one thing at least,0.06966369
it has to get right,0.059977066
no all the Star Wars movies even the bad ones have at least,0.11959988
one good one or two great action,0.038122725
sequences Adam driver once again is perfect as kylo Ren this time around kylo is a little bit more conflicted you saw after when he got his ass handed to him by Rey in the previous movies a little bit more shaken up this time,0.8721773
and this he's got like this is cool,0.09053423
badass like scar across his face,0.69542736
it's like that's that's a true villain right there alright,0.241863
so a driver was like a virtual nobody before like 2015,0.27890265
now he's like considered,0.10131878
one of the bigger stars working today rightfully,0.028905418
so cuz he is a damn good,0.5627902
actor there's a couple scenes between kylo array where they're kind of for having this force connection and they're talking to each other even though they're light-years apart,0.14951119
and those are some of the best moments of the movie cuz it really allowed these two characters to grow and allowed their conflict between them to grow as well by far the best performance in saira movie with the Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker this is by far his best on-screen performance that we've seen from him but we plays looking this is it's a very weathered old man a man who is truly deeply troubled by his past mistakes and you could tell that Mark Hamill had a great time playing and reprising this role for the first time in over 30 years and there's also a lot of really really touching moments with Luke so be on the lookout for those as well I'm sorry I'm just I'm trying my best not to spoil this movie cuz,0.09611406
the nice I just want any I just want to get up and talk about I just want to spoil the show this,0.06667606
but I gotta be I gotta be the professional,0.049698733
I gotta be reasonable like I said this movie is not perfect,0.11382479
it's got its flaws,0.1642484
and this is probably the most polarizing Star Wars film to date,0.07242353
some people would argue that was rogue one but no blast tonight is way more polarizing than Rome,0.13116264
1,
there are things that rien Donson does in this way where he takes chances and some of these chances are cool man,0.04215614
they are pretty heavy,0.39191344
and I think not everybody is gonna appreciate it,0.11982829
so that's why I like some people now are kind of on it because they don't like some of the changes because it doesn't feel like a standard traditional Star Wars movie,0.066838264
and I got some to say about that I got a whole video coming up but I'm the saying like for the most part the things that he changed the new that he brought to the table really worked and it really drove the story and it really added a lot to certain characters but some things that he took in a different direction that were really unnecessary like for instance,0.0450711
I'll do,0.04411705
my best not to spoil this,0.10122354
but there is a little scene that happens in this movie that I understand why they wanted to put in there,0.06725558
I commend them for trying something different,0.09512402
but it is cheesy,0.12895893
it is stupid,0.80035466
and you take it out of the movie and it really doesn't change whatsoever,0.08248341
you probably say that they had it in there for some like some heavy weighted drama but honestly it was pretty pretty cheap,0.14492306
it's got some editing issues here,0.12417537
and there just a little bit like some scene transitions,0.10113634
I felt like in the first actor a little bit like wonky but in an even itself out and then those transitions never came back again but aside from those things I loved the last Jedi for me,0.16071442
it's on the same level as the force awakens,0.070341945
I think in some ways it does things better,0.09429655
the force awakens like for instance is its own story,0.07404072
it's not like retreading,0.1197021
I were stepping on familiar territory,0.08490691
no it's kind of its own story,0.08018796
no kind of does do a couple threads and nods to the original and I feel like the characters grew a little better than this one,0.051469874
but in terms of like a wholesome feeling,0.07014871
I felt like the force awakens beats it out I'm gonna give Star Wars Episode 8 the last Jedi a 9.2 on it's in definitely check it out,0.06642433
it's Star Wars movie of course you're gonna go see it just turn off this review go watch it right away,0.1051244
