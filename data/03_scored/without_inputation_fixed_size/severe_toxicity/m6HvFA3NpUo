a direct sequel to 2015's Mission Impossible rogue nation So this movie contains a couple,0.06959817
of firsts for the franchise first off it is the first time that they have,0.018466828
ever done a direct sequel to the previous film the other movies in this franchise,0.03951989
are standalone stories with relational connections to the previous films this movie is a direct,0.018565942
sequel to the story of 2015's rogue nations So I would highly recommend that you,0.1472823
re watch rogue nation before you watch this film the second first in this movies,0.2037278
It's the first time that a director has returned to do a second movie in,0.017674595
the franchise Chris McQuarrie directed rogue nation And he's come back to direct this film,0.18020424
as well because it is a direct sequel to his other film rogue nation But,0.13702384
before I give my thoughts on the movie if you love to talk movies so,0.03683654
much so that your friends think you talk too Much about movies go ahead and,0.033240557
join us down in the comments section We would love to talk movies with you,0.058926623
all day long Tell us your thoughts on this movie as well as the franchise,0.040154476
in general with that said let's get started talking about the good what I love,0.028482499
about this film is the World-building sort the sixth film in this franchise and what,0.024850596
it wisely does to distinguish itself from the previous five films is try and tie,0.0273457
The world together of this franchise what I mean by that is we start to,0.053175446
understand There's some direct Sixth the film and that just makes us feel like this,0.01557594
"is a bigger world Not just these kind of cool standalone stories, but in a",0.029939916
world that's being inhabited by these characters along those same lines It continues the themes,0.031700656
from the previous film about the consequences of actions and in doing so we start,0.017055973
to dig a lot deeper Into Ethan hunts character instead of him just being seen,0.063093334
as kind of like this unstoppable Action hero this movie dives into his psyche and,0.080195874
the consequences of everything that he's gone through in the previous times It takes a,0.039340958
toll on him and we start to get little pictures of what that looks like.,0.03279089
Another thing The movie does well is it gives us a very clear Story we,0.014405882
know exactly what Ethan is trying to get the warheads and what the consequences Are,0.034350082
if he doesn't get to them in time This also gives a sense of urgency,0.025741942
in tension throughout the entire film and what gives the movie complexity is the different,0.016338905
"characters and their motives, and we're not always sure what Everyone is trying to do",0.013344249
in each scenario and who is betraying who in each situation? So while the basic,0.07122388
story is fairly straightforward it has a lot of nuance to it because of the,0.0133861555
interesting characters that Populate the film speaking of interesting characters this movie has an amazing,0.03699951
cast now we know the returning cast are great in these roles and have amazing,0.016320946
chemistry with one another but we had some new favorites into the mix with Angela,0.0294683
Bassett as kind of this higher up in the government who's not Necessarily on the,0.072060674
side of the IMF and who sends along an operative Henry cavill to kind of,0.022243742
try and watch over the team and make sure these nukes are returned No matter,0.103534505
what and Cavill just makes form. It's an interesting role for him He's playing against,0.023411138
his usual type where he's playing the charming lead here. He's kind of while he's,0.081924684
on the team. He's Antagonistic towards the team and just makes for an interesting fun,0.04898146
kind of tension and dynamic to see him in a different type of role He,0.049834892
also has an amazing mustache in this movie that had dire consequences for the movie,0.09087939
"Justice League I tried to do my own little Henry Cavill mustache, but I forgot",0.09122196
to grow it out starting a week ago so I didn't really pull it off,0.038892623
as well as I would like to but he pulled off the physicality like you,0.24347581
feel him as a physical presence in the room and he plays against Like the,0.052503612
the jokey humor of Simon Pegg and you know the Tom Cruise grin and everything,0.058198914
like that So he's just an interesting new dynamic to add in to the mix,0.0309337
here Also the villain from rogue nation returns in this film I've been critical of,0.11106106
him and rogue nation because I thought that character just seemed off Visually the way,0.082740195
they made him look I just didn't make him feel scary and intimidating to me,0.033261176
and that's different in this film He just has a different look because of where,0.030028386
he's at in life and what's happened since the previous film and he he fits,0.067597955
the role much better in this film and gives off the right vibe and Menacing,0.12234457
ambience around him. Once again the action here is great whether you're talking about motorcycle,0.06630684
chases through crowded Traffic filled European cities or helicopter chases with Tom Cruise Dangling underneath,0.108111635
the helicopter as usual for this franchise. The action sequences are memorable. They're iconic They're,0.01568104
exciting and they're just shot So well like in this movie there's kind of an,0.2805529
infamous stunt in the movie where Tom Cruise got injured and the film was delayed,0.04075181
for a couple of months and They'd showed kind of the shots of It in,0.06966335
some of the trailers a little bit and they kind of would there have been,0.032176927
some leaks of the footage on like TMZ? and stuff like that the shot in,0.07128906
the movie is Awesome. I mean just so well choreographed if you kind of know,0.0738141
the history of the accident and everything like that You know what? It's coming and,0.0661299
it's it's great if refrigerates That's had quite a few great Hand-to-hand fight sequences the,0.032546107
bathroom fight in this one might be the best hand-to-hand fight scene inside of the,0.06690883
franchise and one final Positive while the movie has all the action that the film's,0.021174125
are known for it also has all the spy trickery that the TV show is,0.0148482295
known for with the masks that disguises the sets all the Fun spy stuff where,0.068271786
they're just kind of messing with people's heads It's got all the stuff that Mission,0.10419237
Impossible is known for from there We will move on to the bad in the,0.0308439
big- on this film Is this just a lot of things about the film that,0.0467511
"were very? Predictable and for me, I rewatched all the films in the franchise over",0.03382592
the last month And so maybe I've just got a lot of Mission Impossible on,0.02308653
"the mind. I'm thinking very mission of possible esque, but every single time there is",0.012398358
a moment in the movie where there's a bit of a reveal where the audience,0.026019324
would a little bit I Saw it coming at the very beginning of the scene.,0.040714562
I knew what was about to happen every single time They tried to pull a,0.03997288
trick on the audience. I can see it coming This is both true of individual,0.050257284
sequences as well as the story overall also with the film I feel like it's,0.015941791
almost victim of our expectations of the franchise and what I mean by that is,0.03479376
that Several of the last films have had so many of these iconic stunts that,0.01879809
the level of Expectation has gotten a little bit too high So going back to,0.039647605
that Dubai sequence where Tom Cruise was dangling on the outside of a building and,0.032155644
then they followed that up with Tom Cruise's dangling from a plane as it takes,0.034123257
off That's just the level of expectations so high that there's not really Anything you,0.02558762
can do to top it at that point in time So while the helicopter sequence,0.023427103
in the building jump are great action sequences that are very well shot It doesn't,0.039056923
feel like they top what came before feels like they were trying to do something,0.02689271
to top it But it doesn't quite work And you know by this point I'm,0.021878555
when you've had him on the outside of the plane and you've had him on,0.03224611
the tallest building there's not much you really can do because you can't exactly do,0.054617565
a top and critias space jump in Mission Impossible 7 So that's why I say,0.048564393
that the film feels like a victim of our expectations for it from there I,0.04761717
got one more negative and the third act feels like it was dragged out a,0.055900037
little bit too long there's a time element that plays into the mix and it,0.06659686
seemed like they were repeating some shots in some elements for the sake of Filling,0.0960452
up the amount of time that needed to pass but overall. This is a great,0.053416908
"exciting addition to this franchise overall, if I were to rate this one, I wouldn't",0.02278387
fit a Solid a this is what I wanted out of this movie It's delivering,0.06377914
what this genre is supposed to deliver and on an entertainment level. I would go,0.038607925
with a nine out of ten This is a great spy film It is a,0.070329204
great action film and it does a great job of tying this franchise together there's,0.032058526
not a lot of times where you get to the sixth element of franchise and,0.028682718
it's one of the best and that's Impressive with this franchise. That's kind of been,0.034106627
"firing on all cylinders for about ten Years now, so that's my take on the",0.3905856
movie. How about you did you love it? Did you hate it? Did it live,0.09802412
up to the hype or did it disappoint you a little bit? I would love,0.12991835
"to hear your take on this one. Also, I reviewed all the movies in this",0.02179075
franchise You can check that out right up here lite the fuse That's not good,0.03809174
