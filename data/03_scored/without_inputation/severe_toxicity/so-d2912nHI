what's going on ladies and gentlemen my name is Luke Ennis it's time for another,0.03582679
horror movie review and this one is extra special because this one is actually a,0.05666101
review of something that was sent to me off of my Amazon wishlist by a,0.033946317
very very kind person by the name of Terry fernback otherwise known as mr. T,0.084169015
from Germany he if you go to my link in the description you will find,0.054892287
the podcast we do together called iron cast with our third co-host check out some,0.047770165
episodes of that it's really cool and he very kindly sent me this to read,0.10184893
today well ordered me this sur review today rather the cabinet of dr. Caligari from,0.025954135
1920 so the movie was directed by Robert vine or Wayne I'm not really sure,0.01958234
how you pronounce the surname Andy Stiles werner krauss and Conrad vane again not sure,0.038721006
I'm pronouncing those names exactly right but you know I don't speak German so tensioning,0.16786708
the film is the flashback of a man named Francis describing to a friend the,0.015877934
terrible encounter that ruined the life of him and his fiancee the film essentially goes,0.11341847
on in the flashback to tell the story of dr. Caligari a hypnotist to present,0.058821525
to the world his s'en ambulance it's very difficult Cesare and he is living unconsciously,0.1531419
so to speak and this is quite the spectacle for those who encounter him a,0.018803412
string of murders happen across the town where the story takes place and people begin,0.24282256
to suspect dr. Caligari and and Caesar of being the perpetrators of these crimes this,0.048984125
is the oldest movie on ever likely to review and because there really aren't that,0.014033379
many horror movies before in many ways it's the birth of the horror film as,0.053475443
a feature as we know it you know I mean my sort specialist area when,0.047327816
it comes to horror is the seventies and eighties I mean I that's the area,0.046280153
that I'm most interested in spend most of my time with but that doesn't mean,0.0133854905
that something like this isn't interesting and who's going to be playing art critic a,0.01697216
little bit on this one because you know all there really is to discuss here,0.04916572
is the visuals I guess you know as much as the story is interesting yeah,0.015956426
this is very much a visual masterpiece more than anything else all of the I,0.045061536
guess in a title cards have a really beautiful art style that's not something I,0.049737778
thought I've mentioned in a film review but they're all very they've all got a,0.018087674
great kind of Art Deco feel to them it's very it's very cool to see,0.047409635
those you know the shapes that scatter the back of the cards and you know,0.038055822
the fonts and stuff you know you mostly you know kind of associate in a,0.03277759
title cards from silent films has been you know just these things that flash up,0.025726642
on the screen but here there you are a bit of a feature in and,0.056520656
of themselves and I mean the set design of the movie is just fantastic it's,0.050484113
absolutely brilliant you know these all these sort of jaggedy buildings with these you know,0.15626495
interesting times I mean obviously almost every movie made at this time was shot on,0.1190732
sets you know there was no location shooting really at this time so you know,0.10781762
there was there was an element of that in most great films at the time,0.06500374
but this movie takes it a step further it's like a Picasso painting come to,0.03822877
life you know all these weirdly shaped buildings and these winding alleyways I guess that,0.08491801
all ties in to the fact that it's a flashback you know and this movie,0.043808997
makes you aware that you're here in Reno an interpretation of an event and kind,0.018210068
of a dream I guess in a way that doesn't necessarily portray reality you know,0.023595395
as you get on towards the ending of the film you begin to realize that,0.032906637
actually this is an unreliable narrator you're listening to and so details like that can,0.04747482
be very you know you can't necessarily trust everything you see in the film if,0.015715629
you want to put it like that I mean speaking of that ending you know,0.15013993
for a movie made almost 100 years ago now it's a pretty kind twisted ending,0.05149652
actually you know that you know I'm not going to spoil it obviously putting it,0.05393974
out there that that ending is really quite off the chain quite unsettling and you,0.038229436
know the way that it it comes together you know like I say I think,0.03553677
this is a movie that you know is kind of the birth of horror in,0.081186995
a way you know I can imagine this movie being incredibly shocking at this time,0.07233539
you know given that I guess you know most most of filmmaking at this time,0.020728452
had to be a bit nicey-nicey you know to get something like this was what,0.101621434
would have been very new and quite revolutionary really since its you know a review,0.054588962
off of the wish list I want to talk a little bit about this actual,0.059414204
package itself this is the two-disc limited edition from Eureka entertainment it includes the is,0.018521374
part of their masters of cinema series includes the documentary from Calgary to Hitler it,0.10546021
also includes a few other funny little bits like am you know there's an audio,0.09533944
commentary and all of that sort of thing in terms of special features on really,0.0118469205
think that this should have more on it you know given the amount of money,0.03355785
this costs I know you do pay a little bit more for steel books anyway,0.10824733
but you know this this this blu-ray is kind of close to 30 pounds in,0.0324603
the price range and I really think that for that sort of money you should,0.024150157
be getting a little bit more than you get in this package in terms of,0.064705074
the film itself the Prix is for the most part beautiful and they did have,0.01738657
to source the first act of the movie from an inferior source and so that,0.04000481
is quite noticeable the difference and in the start of the movie it's still perfectly,0.024954364
watchable though ultimately we are lucky to even be able to see this movie almost,0.029943908
100 years later when you consider the amount of movies that just considered lost from,0.014123179
that time that no one has any idea if any prints even exist of any,0.105352454
more and it has to be said man there really I can't imagine there's a,0.019190548
better way to watch the cabinet dr. Caligari than this I'd like to say the,0.0279437
actual print on the movies is you know the best quality of going to see,0.025509793
for the film and you know the color tint is really nice as well you,0.02024819
know the what they've done with Bay's is quite admirable actually overall I'd say that,0.024569223
this set definitely isn't for everyone but I mean if you want to throw down,0.052073237
the money you are going to get a quality set and if you can you,0.028191812
know put aside the kind of not lack of bonus features because there are plenty,0.048727363
of bonus features but then it's the level of bonus features you'd expect from saying,0.019734668
an arrow video release and those are great releases of course but I mean when,0.027518647
you think about they're you know they're real limited edition releases which don't cost as,0.04533692
much as visted you know like The Texas Chainsaw - limited edition that has like,0.03112993
two discs of just bonus features basically this really first money should have more but,0.019363496
other than that is a pretty very pretty cool set I've got so overall cabinet,0.046257537
of dr. Caligari is you know the head of its field really in terms of,0.052553497
you know silent horror German expressionist cinema is a is a really really interesting movie,0.14020474
to watch it's not that long you know this it's a nice easy easy watch,0.06723543
in terms of finding the time to sit down and get into it and yet,0.05042358
so it's a real Trailblazer I mean I see no reason why this film isn't,0.031811744
worthy of a nine out of ten there really aren't any problems with it that,0.026516216
I can I can point out yeah overall the cabinet dr. Caligari is a pretty,0.03228136
